                                                Chapter 1

                                    ASSIGNMENT AUTHORITY

1.1. Assignment Authority. The Department of Defense (DoD) allocates funds, delegates authority and
directs policies for the temporary duty (TDY) assignment and permanent change of duty station (PCS)
assignment of Air Force (AF) military personnel. This instruction implements DoD directives and
instructions and contains the authority, AF policies and procedures, to select personnel and direct their
temporary or permanent assignment or reassignment to satisfy national security requirements. PCS may
also be directed to ensure equitable treatment of members, such as PCS from overseas (OS) to the conti-
nental United States (CONUS), upon completion of the prescribed OS tour. This instruction will be cited
as the assignment authority only for operational (including rotational), training (including formal educa-
tion and professional military education) and force structure assignments. Use Table 1.1. to find infor-
mation on specific assignment policies/procedures.
   1.1.1. Designated Assignment Authority and Assignment Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR).
   Table 1.2. shows the designated assignment authorities and OPRs to which authority is delegated for
   assignments and related actions prescribed by this instruction. The AF uses a centralized assignment
   system to ensure compliance with laws; personnel management directives and instructions; functional
   area directives and instructions; to ensure assignments and related actions are cost effective; fair and
   equitable; and to maintain personnel accountability. PCS assignment authority will not be further del-
   egated. TDY assignment authority is delegated as shown in Chapter 4.
   1.1.2. Other PCSs. There are a number of reasons why AF members may be directed, authorized, or
   entitled to make a PCS. Some examples are upon accession, upon separation or retirement, as a
   patient, as a prisoner, for administrative actions or boards, in connection with judicial proceedings,
   and so on. When PCS is for reasons other than those cited in paragraph 1.1., the PCS authority, fund-
   ing authorization, and policies and procedures to be followed should be within the instruction which
   requires the PCS (see Attachment 22). To assist in determining whether or not to request a PCS in
   accordance with this instruction or some other AF instruction, use this general test: If the reason for
   the PCS is not for the purpose of a member filling a funded vacant manpower authorization and to per-
   form duty in his or her Air Force specialty, and selection of the member was not based on individual
   qualifications and the PCS eligibility policies and procedures prescribed in this instruction, then the
   PCS is not within the authority of this instruction. When a PCS is necessary and no AF instruction
   authorizes the move, then a request for PCS may be submitted as outlined in paragraph 1.5., Excep-
   tions. In one way or another, the MPF provides support for all PCSs. Therefore, to assist MPFs in
   identifying appropriate OPRs for PCS-related queries, Table 1.2. and Attachment 22 are provided for
   information purposes.
   1.1.3. Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) and Permanent Change of (Duty) Station (PCS).
   Normally, an AF member is assigned to a unit to fill a manpower position and perform duty at the
   same location as the unit. As a general assignment policy, AF members will not be permanently
   assigned (including detailed, attached, etc.) to a location unless an AF unit (or AF element for DoD
   organizations) has officially been established at that location. Assignment of AF members OS with-
   out proper establishment of an AF unit at the location where the member will actually perform duty
   can create severe problems (for example, if no Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) exists, or an exist-
   ing agreement does not cover a member and/or his or her family, when the rate of pay and allowances
   is different at the actual duty station in relation to the location of the manpower authorization to which
10                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     the member may be assigned, etc.). Assignments contrary to this policy circumvent the AF manpower
     system and personnel assignment and accountability systems, can affect a member's entitlements and
     pay, and can have serious consequences. Exceptions may be considered according to paragraph 1.5.
        1.1.3.1. PCA with PCS. When members physically perform duty at a location which is the same
        as the organization to which they are assigned, and upon reassignment will physically perform
        duty at a new location, this this is a permanent change of assignment (PCA) with concurrent per-
        manent change of duty station (PCS).
        1.1.3.2. PCA without PCS.
            1.1.3.2.1. When a member is permanently reassigned from one organization to another orga-
            nization with no change of permanent duty station, this is a PCA without PCS (PCA w/o PCS),
            or
            1.1.3.2.2. When a member is permanently reassigned from one permanent duty station to
            another (that is, the duty location [codes] are different) this is normally a PCS, except when
            both locations are within the corporate limits of the same city or town, then both locations are
            considered to be within the same permanent duty station for PCS entitlement purposes (see
            paragraph 2.50.). In such cases, notwithstanding the change of permanent duty stations, the
            move is still managed as a PCA w/o PCS. In other words, the rules for management of PCSs
            do not apply if it is a PCS without PCS entitlements.
        1.1.3.3. PCS without PCA. There are times when it may be necessary to direct AF members to
        physically change stations, but it may not be appropriate to change the unit to which they are
        assigned. This is rarely necessary for assignments directed in accordance with this instruction, but
        is common in connection with PCSs in accordance with other AFIs. For example, a member
        returning from OS for normal retirement may be assigned PCS w/o PCA to a retirement process-
        ing base. During the time between departure from the OS area and actual retirement date, the
        member remains assigned for manning, accountability and other purposes, to their last unit of
        assignment OS.

1.2. Assignment Requests. The Director of Assignments (or equivalent) for major commands (MAJ-
COMs), field operating agencies (FOA), and direct reporting units (DRU), is authorized to initiate assign-
ment requests for members currently assigned to their MAJCOM/FOA/DRU and to request assignment of
personnel to fill valid vacant manpower authorizations. Assignment request authority may be delegated
to the personnel assignment function (or equivalent) at the headquarters of a MAJCOM/FOA/DRU and
will not be further delegated. This does not preclude certain actions authorized to be initiated below
MAJCOM/FOA/DRU level which flow directly to the assignment OPR, but are reviewed at the MAJ-
COM/FOA/DRU assignment function (or equivalent). The personnel assignment function of a MAJ-
COM/FOA/DRU will submit assignment requests in advance to the assignment OPR for the following:
     1.2.1. PCS assignments prescribed by this instruction, intracommand or intercommand, with or with-
     out permanent change of assignment (PCA).
     1.2.2. Any intercommand PCA action prescribed by this instruction (with or without PCS).
     1.2.3. (Officers only.) Any intracommand PCA w/o PCS where officer changes senior rater (for
     example, wing to MAJCOM, MAJCOM to NAF, etc.).

   1.2.4. Any change of position involving a colonel (including selects) into or out of a Defense Acqui-
   sition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) controlled position, joint duty controlled position, or
   position of command at the group level, requires prior approval by the AF Colonel Matters Office,
   Assignments (AFCMOA), whether the position change is a PCA or PCS.
   1.2.5. Assignment of an officer to an unauthorized position (see paragraph 2.46.).
   1.2.6. Assignment of an officer with the grade Lt Col or below to an authorized colonel position must
   be approved in advance by AFCMOA.

12                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     1.3.5. As directed by the designated assignment authority shown in Table 1.2.

1.4. Waivers (see Attachment 1, Definitions). A formal waiver process is established when a need
exists often enough to deviate from a provision established by this instruction (e.g., a standard, a require-
ment, a limit, etc.). Use this paragraph as the basic guidance for processing a waiver, except when a para-
graph, table or attachment contains specific waiver instructions. There is no mandatory format, unless a
paragraph, table or attachment prescribes the waiver content and/or format, but all requests must be justi-
fied. Also see paragraph 1.5., Exceptions, to determine when a request for an exception may be appropri-
ate instead of a request for waiver.
     1.4.1. Justification. Justification for a waiver must show how approval is in the best interests of the
     AF from the standpoint of operational necessity. Waiver requests will not be approved based solely on
     personal desires or for personal reasons but may coincidentally satisfy a member’s personal desires or
     needs. Situations which are not based on operational necessity might be considered as an exception,
     see paragraph 1.5. Requests which do not meet the justification criteria for either a waiver or an
     exception will not be submitted.
     1.4.2. Originator Level. DoD or this instruction requires certain waivers "originate" no lower than a
     minimum level. It is recognized that requests are often "initiated" at a lower level (such as unit or
     group commander). Requests initiated at a lower level, but endorsed at the minimum originator level,
     are acceptable. Waivers may be initiated in one of the following two ways:
        1.4.2.1. A member may initiate a waiver request on his or her own behalf only when specifically
        authorized in a paragraph, table, or attachment. In all other instances, requests by members which
        require waiver(s) must be submitted as an exception according to paragraph 1.5.
        1.4.2.2. An official responsible for a mission which cannot be effectively accomplished except by
        waiver of a provision established by this instruction may initiate a waiver request. When a mini-
        mum originator level has been established, a paragraph, table, or attachment will state the mini-
        mum level. The intent of the minimum originator level is to limit the number of waivers and
        restrict requests to those which are operationally essential. It is not the intent to require (or pro-
        hibit) an official at the minimum originator level to endorse waiver requests from members. It is
        the intent for these officials to originate or endorse only those waiver requests essential to accom-
        plish their mission. Regardless of the originating level, all requests must meet the justification cri-
        teria for approval.
     1.4.3. Commander Actions. All waiver requests will be routed through the unit commander, except
     those originated above the unit level which should be coordinated with the unit commander (for colo-
     nels (including selects), coordinate at least one level below the level of origination). A unit or higher
     level commander may disapprove a waiver request if it is not justified and will advise the requester of
     the reasons for disapproval. Commanders may address the impact approval might have on their local
     mission in their forwarding endorsement. When a unit commander recommends approval or concurs,
     he or she will forward the request to the Relocations Element of the servicing Military Personnel
     Flight (MPF) for a recommendation and, if necessary, forwarding to the minimum originator level,
     unless the request is being processed through command channels. Waiver requests not initiated by a
     member will indicate whether or not the member has been advised and include volunteer status, if
     determined.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                      13


   1.4.4. MPF Actions. MPFs will assist members and commanders in ensuring that the requirements
   established by this instruction are met. MPFs should advise the member, the unit commander or min-
   imum originator level, as appropriate, when a waiver request does not appear to be justified or some
   other requirement is not met. Submission of a waiver request will not be the basis for delay in PCS
   processing or delay in complying with other actions within the time frames prescribed, except as fol-
   lows. When the MPF receives a waiver request of an urgent nature which might have a bearing on a
   member’s pending PCS, the MPF will contact the appropriate assignment OPR (Table 1.2.) for guid-
   ance without delay. Advise members that submission of a waiver request does not change their duty
   status (for example, it does not change them from a leave status to a present for duty or TDY status).
   Submission of a waiver request is not the basis for failure of a member to meet a port call or RNLTD,
   and does not delay the requirement that they make a decision under the 7-day option, or negate any
   other requirement. In urgent situations, the MPF may send a request to the MAJCOM (or equivalent),
   and also include the HQ AFPC assignment OPR or other OPRs as information addressees. This will
   alert these other offices and possibly expedite a final decision.
   1.4.5. MAJCOM (or equivalent) Actions. All waiver requests will be routed through the member’s
   parent MAJCOM except when a paragraph, table, attachment, or other guidance authorizes submis-
   sion directly to the assignment OPR or approval authority. When direct submission is authorized,
   MAJCOM input will be obtained if determined necessary by the assignment OPR or approval author-
   ity. MAJCOMs may disapprove a waiver request which is not justified. For requests which meet the
   criteria for approval in paragraph 1.4.1., MAJCOMs may address the mission impact of approval in
   their forwarding endorsement.
   1.4.6. Assignment OPR and Approval Authority Actions. MAJCOMs (or equivalent) will normally
   forward assignment waiver requests to the assignment OPR, unless instructed otherwise. The assign-
   ment OPR may approve or disapprove a request when authorized, or will make a recommendation and
   forward the request to the approval authority.

1.5. Exceptions (see Attachment 1, Definitions). Exceptions to policies, procedures, or other provi-
sions of this instruction may be considered when an action is prohibited; is not addressed; a criterion is not
met and there are no waiver provisions established; or, there are waiver provisions but that criteria is not
met. Use this paragraph as the basic guidance for processing a request for exception, unless a paragraph,
table, or attachment contains specific instructions for exceptions. There is no mandatory format, but all
requests must be justified.
   1.5.1. Justification. A request for an exception may be justified:
       1.5.1.1. Based upon operational necessity, or
       1.5.1.2. When compliance with a requirement would result in an injustice, a severe inequity, or a
       personal hardship significantly greater than other members encounter in similar circumstances, or
       1.5.1.3. When it is shown an exception serves the overall best interests of the AF.
   1.5.2. Requester or Originator Level. Unless a paragraph on a subject specifies a minimum level,
   there is no minimum originator or requester level for a request for exception (including a request
   which might require waivers). A request for exception may be submitted by an official responsible for
   a mission (that is, unit or group commander, etc.), or a member may submit a request on him or her-
   self. Exception requests from members may be endorsed by senior level officials at their discretion.
   However, requests from members will still be evaluated based on the justification. Disapproval of a
14                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     member’s request which has been endorsed by a senior official will not be construed as disapproval of
     a request originated by a senior official. All requests must cite what exception is requested. Requests
     initiated by members must be submitted through their unit commander. (NOTE: When an exception
     request warrants approval but requires a waiver, the assignment authority serves as the minimum orig-
     inator level and submits a waiver request to the waiver approval authority.)
     1.5.3. Commander Actions. Unit commanders will review requests by members and determine if the
     required justification exists. A unit commander, or higher level commander, may disapprove a mem-
     ber’s request if it is not justified and will advise the member of the reasons for disapproval. Com-
     manders may address the impact approval may have on their local mission in their forwarding
     recommendation. When a commander recommends approval, he or she will forward the request to the
     Relocations Element of the MPF, unless the request is being processed through command channels.
     Exception to policy requests submitted by other than the member will indicate whether or not the
     member has been advised and include volunteer status, if determined.
     1.5.4. MPF Actions. MPFs will assist members and commanders in ensuring the requirements estab-
     lished by this instruction are met. MPFs should advise a member, the unit commander, or other
     requester when a request does not appear to be justified or fails to meet some other requirement. Sub-
     mission of an exception request will not be the basis for delay in PCS processing or delay in comply-
     ing with other actions within the time frames prescribed, except as follows. When the MPF receives
     a request of an urgent nature which might have a bearing on a member’s pending PCS, the MPF will
     contact the appropriate assignment OPR for guidance without delay. Advise members that submis-
     sion of an exception request does not change their duty status (for example, it does not change them
     from a leave status to a present for duty status or TDY status). Submission of an exception request is
     not the basis for failure of a member to meet a port call or RNLTD, and does not delay the requirement
     that they make a decision under the 7-day option, or negate any other requirement. In urgent situa-
     tions, the MPF may send a request to the MAJCOM (or equivalent), and also include the HQ AFPC
     assignment OPR or other OPRs as information addressees. This will alert these other offices and pos-
     sibly expedite a final decision.
     1.5.5. MAJCOM (or equivalent) Actions. All exception requests will be routed through the mem-
     ber’s parent MAJCOM, except when a paragraph, table, attachment, or other guidance authorizes sub-
     mission directly to the assignment OPR or approval authority. When direct submission is authorized,
     MAJCOM input will be obtained if determined necessary by the assignment OPR or approval author-
     ity. MAJCOMs may disapprove a request which is not justified. For requests which meet the criteria
     for approval in paragraph 1.5.1., MAJCOMs may address the mission impact of approval in their for-
     warding endorsement. Exception requests forwarded for consideration should identify what waivers
     of PCS eligibility are required.
     1.5.6. Assignment OPR and Approval Authority Actions. Requests for exceptions to policy, proce-
     dures, or other provisions will be addressed to the office shown below for personnel as indicated.
     These offices, with input from the assignment OPR when necessary, may disapprove a request,
     approve it, or make a recommendation for consideration by the appropriate approval level. When the
     authority to approve a request is within the office shown below, the approved exception will be for-
     warded to the assignment OPR for appropriate action. When an exception (or a waiver in conjunction
     with an exception) requires approval at a higher level, then the assignment OPR will prepare a request
     for assignment, curtailment, or other action, and submit it to the appropriate approval level and
     include the exception approval, or recommendation for approval, from the office listed below.

                                                Chapter 2

                             GENERAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

2.1. General Information. There are a number of policies and procedures which apply to assignment
actions and programs and most of these are stated below. However, additional policies and procedures for
specific actions, assignments, or programs are contained in a paragraph, a table, an attachment, in other
referenced directives or instructions, or in guidance provided by the designated assignment authority or
assignment OPR shown in Table 1.1. It is important to understand that assignments are influenced by all
of these requirements collectively. When necessary in the national interests or the best interests of the AF,
waivers, exceptions and/or deviations from the policies and procedures in this instruction may be autho-
rized by proper authority. For example, AFGOMO (for assignment of general officers, including briga-
dier general selects), AFCMO (for assignment of colonels, including selects), and HQ AFPC/DPAC (for
assignment of CMSgts, including selects), may request or approve waivers, grant exceptions, or deviate
from this instruction when necessary.

2.2. Release of Personal Assignment Information. Certain personal information required for assign-
ments is protected by the Privacy Act of 1974. AFI 37-132, Air Force Privacy Act Program, chapter 9,
Disclosing Records to Third Parties, lists the information which may be released without a member's con-
sent. For example, present and future approved and announced stateside assignment information may be
released without a member's consent; however, information about present or future assignments for OS or
for routinely deployable or sensitive units may not be released. Therefore, assignment functions should
consult AFI 37-132, Air Force Privacy Act Program, upon receipt of requests (written or telephonic) for
information.

2.3. Equal Opportunity. The AF assigns members without regard to color, race, religious preference
(except chaplains), national origin, ethnic background, age, marital status (except military couples),
spouse's employment, educational or volunteer service activities of a spouse, or gender (except as pro-
vided for by statute or other policies). This applies to both PCS and TDY assignments.
   2.3.1. At times, it is in the national interest to restrict the temporary or permanent assignment of AF
   members to certain positions to perform specific roles contrary to the above policy. Restrictions con-
   trary to policy will be considered on a position-by-position basis; each case will be considered inde-
   pendently of any other. Restrictions by country or region will not be considered. Each request for
   restriction will be submitted to the MAJCOM (or equivalent). If no alternatives exist other than
   restricting a position, the MAJCOM (or equivalent) commander, vice commander, or chief of staff
   will submit a request for restriction to HQ USAF/DPF, with an information copy to the designated
   assignment authority (Table 1.1.), assignment OPR (Table 1.1.), and HQ AFPC/DPAPP. Requests
   must contain the following:
       2.3.1.1. Position number, or state if the requirement is for temporary duty (TDY).
       2.3.1.2. Duty description.
       2.3.1.3. Grade and Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) required.
       2.3.1.4. Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) code and unit of assignment (unless requirement is
       for TDY) and specific duty location.
30                                                      AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


        2.3.1.5. Number of positions for which individual restriction is being requested. Number of posi-
        tions in the same grade and AFSC for which restriction is not requested. Total number of positions
        at the location (all grades/AFSCs).
        2.3.1.6. Previous restriction status, if any.
        2.3.1.7. Specifics on the origin of the restriction. Include level of authority which established the
        restriction, basis for the restriction, whether information is verbal or in writing, etc. Restriction
        requests should be submitted as far in advance as possible. Requests will be staffed as quickly as
        possible.
     2.3.2. If a member is denied a passport or a visa, or a foreign country formally refuses to accept him
     or her, and denial is based on one of the factors in paragraph 2.3., the servicing MPF will forward the
     information below without delay to the designated assignment authority (except for HQ AFPC/DPA,
     send to HQ AFPC/DPAPP). The assignment authority forwards the case according to instructions in
     DoD Directive 1315.7.
        2.3.2.1. Name, grade, SSN, unit of assignment and location.
        2.3.2.2. Purpose of travel.
        2.3.2.3. Date of denial.
        2.3.2.4. Foreign country involved.
        2.3.2.5. Name and title of official issuing the denial.

2.4. Primary PCS Selection Factor. The primary factor in selection of a member for PCS is the mem-
ber’s qualifications to fill a valid manpower requirement and perform productively in the position for
which being considered. PCS eligibility factors such as time on station (TOS) and so on, although impor-
tant, are secondary. When members with the required qualifications are identified, then PCS eligibility
criteria and other factors will be considered. Volunteer status, individual preferences, humanitarian or
special circumstances may be considered to the extent these factors are consistent with operational man-
ning requirements. PCS is not authorized based solely on the fact a member can be used or prefers assign-
ment elsewhere.
     2.4.1. Special Experience Identifier (SEI). AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officers
     and Airmen) implements policy and prescribes procedures for SEI establishment and management.
     The SEI complements the assignment process and is used in conjunction with the grade, AFSC (or
     Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) code), AFSC prefixes and suffixes, Special Duty Identifier (SDI),
     Reporting Identifier (RI), Personnel Processing Codes (PPC), and professional specialty course codes.
     The SEI system may be used when experience or training is critical to the job/person assignment
     match, and no other means is appropriate or available. SEIs can be used when it is essential to rapidly
     identify personnel to meet unique circumstances, contingency requirements, or other critical needs.
     Manpower positions are coded with an appropriate SEI to identify positions that require, or provide
     unique experience/qualification.
        2.4.1.1. Assignment OPRs must approve requests in advance to match assignments using the SEI
        because of the potential to subordinate other important assignment considerations. Further, after
        selections have been made, the assignment OPR will review them to ensure the impact in relation
        to other factors is justified.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                   31


       2.4.1.2. Requests for exceptions to match by SEI without manpower positions being coded
       require approval of the HQ AFPC assignment branch chief.
   2.4.2. Security Access Requirement. Manpower positions often require members assigned have
   access to a specified level of classified information. However, sometimes the urgency to fill a position
   does not allow selection of a member using PCS eligibility criteria and subsequent processing (and/or
   investigation) for access at the specified level. Under these circumstances, selection may be necessary
   from among members who currently have access or can be granted access immediately. The assign-
   ment OPR must approve in advance assignment selection based upon a member's security status. Fur-
   ther, after such selections have been made, the assignment OPR will review them to ensure the impact
   in relation to other factors is justified.
   2.4.3. PCS Costs. Assignments of qualified, eligible members are directed as economically as possi-
   ble, when other considerations are not overriding. PCS cost projections are based on the average cost
   for a particular kind of move and whether the person moving is an officer or airman.

2.5. PERSTEMPO. In its simplest definition, PERSTEMPO is the number of days per 12-month period
a member is TDY away from his or her permanent duty station. In general, TDY in excess of 120 days in
a 12-month period is considered to be high PERSTEMPO. In a broader sense, PERSTEMPO is the short
and long term impact on a member, a member’s unit, his or her family, and so on of satisfying the needs
of the AF. In this respect, all TDY and PCS assignment policies and procedures are PERSTEMPO sensi-
tive.

2.6. PCS Entitlements. When a member is directed to make a PCS, the AF may not deny the member
any of the travel and transportation allowances or entitlements associated with the PCS. Members cannot
waive their PCS entitlements in return for PCS consideration. When members take an action for which an
entitlement exists, that obligates the government to payment should the member claim reimbursement.
Members will not be afforded special assignment consideration on the basis of PCS entitlements they may
or may not use, other than as authorized in conjunction with an approved program (for example, the
Home-Basing and Follow-On Assignment Programs, as outlined in Attachment 5).

2.7. Grade, AFSC and Skill Level Relationship for Assignments.
   2.7.1. Officers. Officers are eligible for assignment in any AFSC they possess or are qualified to be
   awarded. Normally officers are assigned to manpower authorizations which match their current
   grade; however, the needs of the AF may require assignment otherwise. Also see paragraph 2.18. for
   assignment of officers nonselected for promotion. Up to the grade of lieutenant colonel, promotion
   may not be the sole basis for PCS. Lieutenant colonels may not be assigned to colonel positions
   without the advance approval of AFCMOA.
   2.7.2. Airmen. When necessary in the best interests of the AF, assignments may be directed by the
   assignment OPR other than as shown below.
       2.7.2.1. CMSgts (including CMSgt selects) may be assigned in any AFSC or Chief Enlisted Man-
       ager (CEM) Code they possess or are qualified to be awarded.
       2.7.2.2. Normally, airmen in the grade of SMSgt and below are selected for assignment in their
       Control Air Force Specialty Code (CAFSC), except airmen serving in a special duty identifier
32                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


        (SDI) or reporting identifier (RI) who are normally selected based on their Primary AFSC
        (PAFSC).
            2.7.2.2.1. Airmen with an incompatible grade and CAFSC skill level because of retraining or
            reclassification are selected for assignment and allocated against requirements commensurate
            with their grade, regardless of the skill level of their CAFSC. See Table 2.1., AAC 29.
            2.7.2.2.2. Airmen who possess CONUS/OS Imbalanced skills are managed as outlined in
            Chapter 3.
        2.7.2.3. Normally, airmen are selected to fill manpower requirements with grade and skill combi-
        nations as shown below. Airmen projected for promotion to the next higher grade are normally
        considered for assignment based on their projected grade. Up to the grade of SMSgt, promotion
        may not be the sole basis for PCS. The needs of the AF may require assignment other than as
        shown below.
            2.7.2.3.1. CMSgts (E-9) for Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) code positions.
            2.7.2.3.2. SMSgts (E-8) for 9-level positions.
            2.7.2.3.3. MSgt (E-7) and TSgt (E-6) for 7 level positions.
            2.7.2.3.4. SSgt (E-5) and Senior Airman (SRA) for 5 level positions.
            2.7.2.3.5. Airman First Class (A1C), Airman (Amn) and Airman Basic (AB) for 3 level posi-
            tions.
        2.7.2.4. Airmen retraining into SDI 8F000, First Sergeant, will not normally be assigned OS as
        nonvolunteers until they have completed 24 months in SDI 8F000. All other retrainees may be
        assigned to OS long tour areas on their initial assignment as volunteers; however, they will not
        normally be assigned to short tour areas (as a volunteer or nonvolunteer) until they have com-
        pleted 24 months in the new AFSC. See Table 2.1., AAC 45.

2.8. Manpower Authorization Changes. Normally, assignments will not be made nor manning entitle-
ment adjusted in response to increases in functional category "A" military manpower authorizations by
AFSC which are approved and made effective within the current or two succeeding fiscal quarters. This
provides a minimum lead time of at least 6 months (or more) so the assignment process can react to the
increase, provide members the standard minimum notice of selection, and so on. A MAJCOM/FOA/
DRU (or equivalent) may submit a request with justification to the assignment OPR requesting fill of
positions sooner or adjustment of manning entitlement earlier than the above minimum. The assignment
OPR for each AFSC increased will evaluate such requests and provide an appropriate response. Assign-
ment of members incident to decreases in authorizations resulting in a surplus will be managed according
to guidance in paragraph 2.48.

2.9. Utilization Standards and Assignment of Rated Officers.
     2.9.1. Utilization Standards for Rated Officers. The Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989
     (ACIA), codified as Title 37, U.S.C., Section 301a, imposes utilization standards, commonly referred
     to as “gates,” which require that rated officers be assigned to operational flying duties for specific
     amounts of time by 12 years (1st gate), or 18 years (2nd/3rd gate) of aviation service to maintain their
     entitlement to continuous aviation career incentive pay (ACIP). Duties that qualify as operational fly-
     ing duties are identified by aircrew position identifier (API) codes 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8. Aircrew Position
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                   33


  Indicator (API) codes 0, 3 and 4 identify other than operational flying duty. A rated officer must per-
  form at least 8 years (96 months-1st gate) of operational flying duty by the 12th year of aviation ser-
  vice to receive ACIP through 18 years of aviation service; at least 10 years (120 months-2nd gate) of
  operational flying duty by the 18th year of aviation service to receive ACIP through 22 years of
  officer service; and at least 12 years (144 months-3rd gate) of operational flying duty by the 18th year
  of aviation service to receive ACIP through 25 years of officer service. It is Air Force policy that as
  many members as possible perform flying duties to meet their 1st and 2nd gates. Not all officers will
  fulfill the requirements for their 3rd gate. AFI 11-401, Flight Management, chapter 2, explains these
  requirements in detail. Compliance with the following guidance in combination with paragraph 2.45.,
  Officer Duty Changes is essential so the careers of rated officers are properly managed and each flyer
  maintains rated skills while concurrently meeting Air Force requirements in other than flying duties.
  Waivers of the following policies require HQ AFPC/DPAO approval.
     2.9.1.1. Graduates of undergraduate flying training (UFT) are assigned to operational flying
     duties until they have completed 96 months of flying to the maximum extent possible. Gate credit
     accumulated during UFT counts toward this restriction.
     2.9.1.2. Upon completion of 96 months of operational flying, rated officers may be considered, if
     otherwise eligible and qualified, for duties other than operational flying.
     2.9.1.3. The typical officer with over 12 years of aviation service must have completed or be able
     to complete at least 10 years, and preferably 12 years of operational flying duty before the 18th
     year of aviation service before being assigned to duties other than operational flying. In those
     cases where rated officers are currently assigned to stabilized tours in duties other than operational
     flying and the possibility exists of the officers not meeting the utilization standards, tour curtail-
     ments (or waiver of remaining stabilized tour period) may be directed by the assignment OPR
     according to the established policies in paragraph 2.15.6. To the extent possible, tour curtailments
     (or waiver of remaining stabilized tour period) will normally be directed sufficiently in advance to
     provide adequate and timely replacement.
  2.9.2. Rated Officer Assignments (Lieutenant Colonels and Below). Rated officers who are not dis-
  qualified for aviation service in accordance with AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aero-
  nautical Ratings and Badges are assigned primarily to fill rated requirements.
     2.9.2.1. Rated officers may ask for a change to another rated AFSC or nonrated duty as indicated
     in paragraph 2.45. In addition, a commander or MAJCOM may submit requests to resolve man-
     ning problems or to provide career development opportunities.
     2.9.2.2. Report officers disqualified from aviation service per AFI 11-402, for assignment or other
     disposition according to paragraph 2.41. Rated officers disqualified from aviation service for
     medical reasons may continue to be assigned to duty in a rated AFSC not involving operational
     flying upon approval of HQ AFPC/DPAO according to AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Person-
     nel (Officers and Airmen).
     2.9.2.3. Report officers eliminated from a flying training course being attended in PCS status or
     TDY en route PCS status, and officers eliminated from undergraduate flying according to para-
     graph 2.41.
  2.9.3. Voluntary Request for Disqualification from Aviation Service. Rated officers applying for a
  commission change, legal, or medical education programs, must include a voluntary request for dis-
  qualification for aviation service. Refer to AFI 11-402, paragraph 3.7.1.4 for complete instructions.

     2.9.4. Assignment of Rated Officers to Non Flying Positions. Rated officers who volunteer for a non
     flying position (PCS or PCA), when a flying position is available, must complete the statement in
     Figure 2.1. Similarly, when the assignment OPR selects a volunteer for a non-flying position when a
     flying position is available, the assignment transaction must include the personnel processing code
     (PPC) “GTW” in the assignment notification.

SUBJECT: Acknowledgment of Understanding -- Aviation Career Improvement Act (ACIA)
1. I, (name, SSN), acknowledge that I voluntarily elect to pursue a non flying duty assignment and will
fail to achieve my (1st) (2nd) flying gate. (See paragraph 2.9., AFI 36-2110, Assignments.)
2. I recognize this action will terminate my continuous entitlement to Aviation Career Incentive Pay after
passing (12 years of aviation service) (18 years of aviation service) (22 years of officer service). I further
acknowledge understanding that aviation incentive pay after the (12th year of aviation service) (18th year
of aviation service) (22nd year of officer service) is contingent on my having a rated duty AFSC and
being assigned to operational flying duty.
                                                     (Signature)
                                                     (Typed name, grade, SSN)

NOTE: Officers provide the original to HQ AFPC/DPAO, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-6001 through the
MPF before the assignment OPR approves the assignment. Assignment OPRs file the original in the
officer's Master Personnel Records Group as a permanent document.

2.10. Volunteer Status and PCS Eligibility. Within a group of qualified members who meet the mini-
mum eligibility criteria for PCS selection, volunteers are selected ahead of nonvolunteers. Nonvolunteers
qualified to fill a requirement who meet the minimum eligibility criteria for PCS are selected ahead of
qualified volunteers who do not meet the minimum eligibility criteria for PCS. For example, using the
PCS eligibility criterion of TOS for a CONUS to CONUS PCS, qualified volunteers who meet the mini-
mum TOS requirements are considered first in order of longest on station and qualified nonvolunteers
who meet the minimum TOS are considered next in order of longest on station. Stated another way, qual-
ified volunteers who do not meet minimum TOS requirements will not be selected ahead of qualified non-
volunteers who meet minimum TOS requirements.

2.11. Volunteers Replacing Nonvolunteers Selected for PCS. Members who are volunteers (or want to
volunteer) for a specific assignment are not permitted to replace nonvolunteers already selected for an
assignment. If such replacements were permitted, in most instances the nonvolunteer would be reselected
based on original eligibility. Members who are volunteers for an assignment will be selected, in turn,
when they become the most eligible volunteer. See paragraph 2.12. when a member selected for PCS as
a volunteer wants to change status to a nonvolunteer.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                     35


2.12. Change of Volunteer Status After PCS Selection. A member selected as a volunteer for an
assignment who is no longer a volunteer may request the MPF submit a reclama per paragraph 2.47. The
reason for reclama is simply the member is no longer a volunteer. (NOTE: A request under this para-
graph is different than a member requesting cancellation of an assignment based on hardship, denial of
dependent travel due to a lack of general medical services (see Attachment 7, or other reasons). A
request for cancellation under this paragraph does not require justification. The decision whether or not
to cancel the assignment is not based on the justification or reason for change of volunteer status, but sim-
ply whether there are other qualified, eligible volunteers from which to select, the amount of lead time to
select and notify another person, training scheduled or completed, and other variables. When a request is
disapproved, the official selection status for PCS will remain that the member was selected as a volunteer.
The member’s status as a volunteer at the time of PCS selection will not be changed and the member
allowed to remain on the assignment as a nonvolunteer. If a PCS cancellation request submitted under
this paragraph is disapproved, a member cannot at that time request separation or retirement under 7-day
option provisions (unless they are still within 7 days of official notification). Having accepted a PCS or
training, an officer may not cancel a Specified Period of Time Contract (SPTC), nor may an airman cancel
a voluntary extension of enlistment or reenlistment, which was executed for the purpose of accepting the
PCS or training. An SPTC for an officer or an airman's extension of enlistment (but not a reenlistment)
may be canceled as outlined in the prescribing instruction for those actions if it no longer serves the pur-
pose for which executed. For example, if an airman extends an enlistment to accept an assignment and
the assignment is canceled, then the airman may request cancellation of the extension.

2.13. Minimum Age for Assignment to a Hostile Fire/Imminent Danger Area. AF members must be
at least 18 years of age to be assigned (PCS or TDY) to a hostile fire or imminent danger area.

2.14. Noncareer Officers and First-Term Airmen (FTA). For various reasons there are several assign-
ment provisions which apply only to noncareer officers (see Attachment 1, Definitions) and FTA (see
Attachment 1, Definitions). When a paragraph, table, or attachment does not stipulate special guidance
for noncareer officers or FTA, then the guidance is the same as for career members.
   2.14.1. Noncareer officers are not arbitrarily limited in the number of PCSs they may be directed to
   make. Compliance with TOS minimums, selecting personnel in turn based on longest on station, and
   other factors are adequate to limit the number of moves.
   2.14.2. FTA serving an initial enlistment of 4 or more years may be given not more than two assign-
   ments in different locations following initial basic and skill training during their first 4 years of ser-
   vice, regardless of tour length. FTA who have made two PCS moves are permitted an additional PCS
   in conjunction with an approved humanitarian reassignment, a join spouse assignment, as a volunteer,
   or when the PCS is a mandatory move. Low-cost moves are excluded from the two-move count.
   2.14.3. Noncareer officers fall into two groups and are managed as follows:
       2.14.3.1. Noncareer officers with an established date of separation (DOS) (that is, they do not
       have an indefinite DOS) may decline to obtain retainability for a PCS or training ADSC, without
       prejudice. For example, a Medical Service officer with an established DOS as the result of an
       SPTC may decline to obtain retainability for a PCS or training ADSC, without prejudice. NOTE:
       Expiration of an ADSC is not the same as an established DOS.
       2.14.3.2. Noncareer officers with an indefinite DOS have indefinite service retainability for any
       ADSC-incurring event such as PCS or training. NOTE: Expiration of an ADSC is not the same
36                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


       as an established DOS. A noncareer officer who does not desire to participate in an ADSC-incur-
       ring event, such as PCS or training, must exercise his or her option to establish a separation date
       under 7-day option provisions as explained in paragraph 2.37. However, to provide noncareer
       officers adequate time to acclimate to military service, to avoid forcing them to make a premature
       career decision, and to the extent operational requirements permit, the following policy applies.
       As a nonvolunteer, noncareer officers with an indefinite DOS may be selected for an ADSC-incur-
       ring event when:
           2.14.3.2.1. The ADSC can be completed before becoming a career officer (for assignment
           purposes, a career officer is (both) a captain or higher who has 4 or more years total active fed-
           eral commissioned service [TAFCS]). For eligibility for involuntary PCS OS, compute com-
           pletion of the ADSC for the OS tour using the unaccompanied tour length. A noncareer officer
           who elects to serve the accompanied OS tour length voluntarily incurs the longer accompanied
           ADSC (which may result in becoming a career officer), or
           2.14.3.2.2. They are within 12 months of having 4 years TAFCS and have no ADSC beyond
           4 years. (Unless a waiver is approved by the assignment authority. Within HQ AFPC, waiver
           authority is the assignment division chief.) This allows a noncareer officer who does not
           desire an additional ADSC beyond 4 years to request separation in lieu of an event, or
           2.14.3.2.3. They already have an ADSC beyond 4 years TAFCS. In this instance, career
           officer procedures apply.

2.15. Assignment Deferment and Availability. The reasons for deferments vary. For example, defer-
ments may be authorized when it is possible in most grades and AFSCs to maintain an equitable assign-
ment system and also support the need for stability in certain organizations or functions. In other
instances, deferments are to preclude a member's PCS while suitability to remain on active duty is evalu-
ated or during a period of observation or rehabilitation. And still further, sometimes a deferment period is
required to process or complete an action, recognize a temporary PCS ineligibility condition, or other cir-
cumstance of a temporary nature. The most common reasons for deferment are identified by assignment
availability codes (AACs) shown in Table 2.1. A list of activities, organizations, or positions authorized
stabilized tours is maintained and continually updated by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 in the Stabilized Tour
Guide. MPFs can access this Guide on the time share system (TSS2) ZEUS file by using the prompt
"GET 09RPPFC/TOURGUID." The guide shows what organizations are authorized stabilized tours, the
length of the tour, and if the tour is designated a minimum or maximum tour. When a previously granted
deferment causes significant assignment inequities, then waiver of the deferment may be considered
depending on the reason deferred. To preclude assignment inequities or granting a deferment and subse-
quently having to waive it, the AF must carefully limit both the number of organizations/functions, etc.,
authorized stabilized tour deferments and limit the number of individual deferments. Generally, when it
is foreseeable a member may be vulnerable for PCS selection during the period of a proposed deferment
or stabilized tour, then a request for PCS or deferment should not be approved. Deferment or stabilized
tour assignment notwithstanding, all members are subject to temporary or permanent assignment to meet
worldwide AF requirements. An AAC usually applies only to a member's current assignment. Defer-
ments may be based on a specific action applicable to only one member (such as placement on the control
roster, or operational deferment), or circumstances that apply to all members in a unit (such as assignment
to a stabilized tour). When a previously authorized deferment no longer serves the overall best interest of
the AF (for example, the member is required to fill a higher priority manning need or assignment OS is
necessary to ensure equitable distribution of OS assignments), a deferment may be terminated (waived/
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    37


curtailed) by either HQ AFPC/DPAPP1, or the assignment or other appropriate OPR. The deferment of a
group may be removed or modified by the authority which granted the original deferment. The reasons
for deferment are addressed in specific paragraphs elsewhere in this instruction or deferment may be
directed per another directive or instruction. For example, medical instructions prescribe which injuries,
illnesses, or diseases render a member ineligible for PCS or TDY, and the duration of the deferment.
Therefore, that medical instruction authorizes temporary deferment for medical conditions. Even though
this instruction authorizes waiver of deferment, an assignment OPR may not waive a deferment or AAC
for which assignments is not the OPR without coordination with the OPR. For example, waiver of AAC
14, Material Witness, would require coordination with the SJA which requested the code (or the SJA
might agree to remove the code). Stabilized tour deferments are not normally updated for members serv-
ing OS; however, there are some exceptions (for example, officers serving OS in joint activities filling
positions designated as joint duty assignments (JDA). See Table 2.1. to confirm which specific codes are
updated when serving OS. The following additional guidance applies.
   2.15.1. Date of Availability (DOA). A member is considered available for reassignment on the first
   day of the "availability" month. Availability for assignment in the PDS is managed by month and
   year. The DOA is computed in different ways depending on the reason for the AAC. For stabilized
   tours, compute the DOA by adding the stabilized tour period to the DAS or date assigned to the tour.
   For example, a member is assigned duty on a three year stabilized tour on 22 June 1997. The mem-
   ber’s DOA is Jun 00 and because of the way stabilized tour DOAs are computed, the member is
   shown as available on 1 June 2000. However, when selection for PCS is made by computer, computer
   programming takes into account how stabilized tour DOAs are computed and assignment selection
   will not normally be to fill a requirement which requires departure within the availability month. For
   example, a member available in Jun would normally not be selected by the computer for an assign-
   ment with an RNLTD earlier than 31 Aug. If the same member was applied to a requirement with a
   10th of the month RNLTD, then the RNLTD for a person with a Jun DOA would not be earlier than 10
   Sep. When assignment selections are done manually, assignment OPRs will take into account how
   stabilized tour DOAs are computed and make assignment selections accordingly. EXCEPTION: For
   officers, the joint duty assignment DOA is computed based on joint duty credit guidelines (see para-
   graph 2.15.6.3. below). When the reason for an AAC is based on a quality control indicator (Table
   2.1., AACs 10 through 21, except 14) then the DOA is the month following completion of the action.
   For example, a member receives an Article 15 on 22 June 1997 with a six month suspended reduction,
   or is placed on the control roster 22 June 1997 for a six month observation period. Although the
   actions expire 21 December 1997, the correct DOA in each case is January 1998. This is necessary to
   ensure a departure date (mo/yr) no earlier than the completion of disciplinary, rehabilitative, or admin-
   istrative action. As a rule, members are matched to requirements and RNLTDs are established so the
   departure date is not earlier than the first day of the availability month and year. If an MPF receives
   an assignment (deferment not waived) containing an RNLTD which requires departure prior to the
   first day of a member's availability month and year (see paragraph 2.26.), the MPF will reclama the
   assignment and request an RNLTD change or waiver of the deferment. EXCEPTION: A reclama is
   not necessary to change the RNLTD or a waiver of deferment is not required when the member desires
   to depart after the actual day punishment or an observation period, etc., expires and the commander
   concurs. For example, using the Article 15 or control roster situations, a member's punishment or
   observation period expires 21 December 1997, the PDS reflects a DOA of January 1998, and the
   member is selected for an assignment with an RNLTD of 31 January 1998. If the member desires 30
   days delay en route plus travel time, etc., and the commander concurs with the requested departure
38                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     date, the member may depart on 22 December 1997 (or any day thereafter) without a reclama to
     change the RNLTD or waiver of deferment.
        2.15.1.1. When more than one AAC applies to a member, the code for the longest period of defer-
        ment is entered as the first AAC, then the AAC for the next longest deferment, and so on. As a
        guide, if it becomes necessary to waive deferments, the longest organizational (as opposed to
        by-name) deferments are waived first. For example, a four year organizational deferment is nor-
        mally waived before a three year deferment, and both before waiving a one year individual
        (by-name) deferment. Deferments not involving the expenditure of PCS funds are waived before
        those where the member made a PCS move in conjunction with deferment. For example, the
        deferment of an OS returnee assigned to a stabilized tour upon completion of the OS tour, or a
        member on a base for several years who moves on the same base to a stabilized tour and is then
        deferred, will have deferments waived before a member assigned to the current location specifi-
        cally to join spouse. There may be exceptions since manning priorities, requirement for backfill,
        humanitarian considerations, and so on may dictate some other order be followed in particular cir-
        cumstances.
        2.15.1.2. MPFs are not authorized to update the following AACs (these AACs are updated by the
        assignment OPR only): 36 (airmen only), 46, 48, 54 and 56.
        2.15.1.3. MPFs may place members in the following AACs when they receive "by-name" defer-
        ment authority: 01, 21 (for "other" reasons as shown in Table 2.1. and paragraph 2.40.3.10.), 28,
        30, 34, 39, 41, 51 (airmen only), 52 (officers only), 58, and 85. NOTE: MPFs may use the assign-
        ment action reason for a member's PCS, assignment trailer remarks, or other approval (such as a
        letter/memo, approved application, PCS orders, etc.) as authority for deferment.
        2.15.1.4. MPFs may place members in the following AACs when they receive "by-name" defer-
        ment authority, or when the MPF confirms the member is authorized deferment as a result of being
        assigned to an organization, function, position, etc., as shown in the Stabilized Tour Guide (see
        paragraph 2.15.6.): 22, 36 (officers only), 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 50, 51 (officers only), 55, 57 or 59.
        NOTE: MPFs may use the assignment action reason for a member's PCS, assignment trailer
        remarks, or other approval (such as a letter/memo, approved application, PCS orders, etc.) as
        authority for deferment.
        2.15.1.5. MPFs may place members in the following AACs when this instruction or some other
        instruction or directive requires or authorizes deferment: 02, 05, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
        17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 37, 38, 40, 52 (airmen only), 53, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73,
        74, 77 and 81. NOTE: MPFs may use the assignment action reason for a member's PCS, assign-
        ment trailer remarks, or other approval (such as a letter/memo, approved application, PCS orders,
        etc.) as authority for deferment.
     2.15.2. When a member is not initially assigned to a stabilized tour upon arrival PCS and subsequent
     assignment to a stabilized tour at the same location is proposed, a specific period of deferment must be
     proposed and the deferment approved by the assignment OPR at the time the assignment is approved.
     2.15.3. Members who are vulnerable for OS assignment selection are not normally approved for
     placement in an organizational deferment AAC except members arriving PCS for immediate assign-
     ment to an activity or function authorized deferment, or the reason for reassignment carries with it a
     deferment upon completion of PCS (for example, humanitarian reassignment, join spouse assignment,
     and so on).
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  39


  2.15.4. Military Operational Deferment. At times the continued assignment of a particular member
  may be essential to the accomplishment of a specific mission. In these rare circumstances, a military
  operational deferment of a member may be requested and may be over and above an existing unit or
  function deferment. When waiver of deferments becomes necessary, operational deferments (AAC
  58 for officers and AAC 51 for airmen) are among the last to be waived because of the short duration
  and justification on an individual basis. Normally, only one operational deferment is granted a mem-
  ber and the period will not exceed one year. This period is adequate in most cases to train replacement
  members or make arrangements for project or program continuity. A military operational deferment
  is appropriate only in support of units transitioning to a new or significantly different weapons system
  or to support special projects generated by high-level tasking where duties and the member's qualifi-
  cations are significantly different from those normally associated with the member's career field. A
  request for operational deferment must contain complete details to include cost factors, the mission
  impact, and why a particular member's presence and qualifications are essential to the mission.
  Requests are routed through the MAJCOM and may be disapproved at that level. When the MAJ-
  COM recommends approval, the request is forwarded for a decision to the assignment OPR (Table
  1.1.).
  2.15.5. Educational Deferment. It is the intent of the AF to support members in achievement of their
  personal education goals provided they satisfy their primary duties without significant impact on
  "in-turn" assignments. Therefore, at key times in certain educational programs, members may be
  authorized deferments for educational reasons, such as whenever the education program will be com-
  pleted during the deferment period. Like other deferments, education deferments may be waived
  when they do not serve the overall best interest of the AF. Educational deferments may be requested
  per AFI 36-2306, The Education Services Program. The following criteria applies.
     2.15.5.1. Officers. An officer enrolled in an off-duty education program who does not have an
     established ASD may be deferred from PCS for the period necessary to complete the degree
     requirements for award of a baccalaureate or graduate degree. However, deferment is not autho-
     rized for the purpose of completing an additional degree equal or lower than is currently held
     unless it directly applies to the member's AFSC or AF needs. Also, an officer may be deferred
     from PCS to meet the academic residency requirements for a doctorate degree. In all cases, the
     deferment period may not exceed 12 months and is terminated when studies are discontinued, or
     when the degree requirements are completed, whichever occurs first. A deferment for the purpose
     of completing a thesis or research paper is not authorized.
     2.15.5.2. Airmen. An airman enrolled in a voluntary education program (local off-duty study)
     who does not have an ASD may ask for deferment to preclude departure on an assignment before
     completion of the specific education program. The deferment is terminated at the end of the spec-
     ified period, when studies are discontinued, or when degree or academic requirements are com-
     pleted, whichever occurs first. Eligibility criteria follows:
         2.15.5.2.1. High School Programs. On certification of the Education Services Officer, airmen
         may be deferred from PCS for a period not more than nine months if enrolled in classroom
         study designed to prepare them to take the high school General Educational Development
         (GED) tests leading to a high school diploma or equivalent.
         2.15.5.2.2. Vocational School Program. Airmen enrolled in programs leading to award of a
         vocational diploma may be delayed from PCS for a period not to exceed three months from the
         month of PCS notification.
40                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


            2.15.5.2.3. Associate, Baccalaureate, and Graduate Degree Programs. Airmen enrolled in
            programs leading to award of a degree may be deferred from PCS if they can complete the
            degree and any required academic residency in 12 months or less. FTA not obligated for a
            total of six years active service are not eligible for a 12 month deferment. They may request
            a change of RNLTD for a period not to exceed three months from the month of PCS notifica-
            tion in order to complete a course in which presently enrolled. Deferments approved under
            this provision are not to exceed the course completion date.
        2.15.5.3. Officers and Airmen. A request for deferment is sent by the member to the local Educa-
        tion Services Officer for a decision who then forwards approvals to the MPF. The Education Ser-
        vices Officer reviews the request to ensure it meets the criteria for deferment. For officers, the
        MPF inputs PTI 484 which flows through the MAJCOM to the assignment OPR for a decision.
        For airmen, the MPF approves those requests which meet the criteria for approval and updates the
        PDS with AAC 52. Questionable cases should be forwarded to HQ AFPC/ DPAPP1 for resolu-
        tion. Consecutive education deferments are not permitted. A subsequent deferment that would be
        effective within 12 months of a previously completed program is not authorized. A member is not
        granted any additional deferment beyond that originally granted to retake tests or courses failed.
        2.15.5.4. Operation Bootstrap TDY. Members must meet the criteria in AFI 36-2306, The Educa-
        tion Services Program. For approved requests, the TDY order is used as the source document for
        update of AAC 52 and may be input by the MPF upon receipt. The deferment period may not
        exceed the period of TDY authorized. Members with an ASD are ineligible.
     2.15.6. Stabilized Tour Deferment. There are certain activities and organizations whose mission or
     function make it in the best interest of the AF under normal circumstances to manage a member's
     period of assignment more closely than would be realized by normal attrition and TOS requirements.
     A list of activities, organizations, or positions authorized stabilized tours is maintained and continu-
     ally updated by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 in the Stabilized Tour Guide. MPFs can access this Guide on the
     time share system (TSS2) ZEUS file by using the prompt "GET 09RPPFC/TOURGUID." Stabilized
     tour deferment is not authorized for members assigned OS. The stabilized tour deferment of a mem-
     ber may be waived or an activity may be terminated when it no longer serves the overall best interest
     of the AF. For management purposes, stabilized tours are divided into two major groups, maximum
     and minimum tours.
        2.15.6.1. Maximum Tours. A maximum tour is one where the initial deferment is intended to be
        the maximum period of time a member will be assigned to that duty and/or organization, unless an
        extension is approved. The reasons vary why the period of assignment should not exceed the ini-
        tial deferment period. For example, the duty may be outside the mainstream of a member's pri-
        mary career field and prolonged assignment is undesirable. The AACs for maximum tours are 46
        and 50 for officers, and 50 for airmen.
        2.15.6.2. Minimum Tours. A minimum tour is one where it is intended that a member be assigned
        for at least the initial prescribed tour length, but longer assignment is authorized. An extension of
        a minimum tour deferment is not required. After expiration of the initial deferment, a member
        remains assigned until selected for another assignment. The reasons for a minimum tour vary. For
        example, a minimum tour may be necessary to receive pay back for special training (formal or
        on-the-job), for experience gained, and so on.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                41


     2.15.6.3. Officer Joint Duty Assignment (JDA). HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 provides policy and guid-
     ance on joint officer matters. This office is the liaison between AFPC assignment OPRs, the Air
     Staff and OSD. Only officers possessing demonstrated qualities of high personal and professional
     competence are assigned to a designated JDA (see Attachment 1) position. There are three types
     of designated JDA positions: positions requiring a Joint Specialty Officer (JSO)(see Attachment
     1); positions requiring a JSO Nominee (JSO Nom)(see Attachment 1) or a combination of JSO
     and JSO Noms; and the remaining designated JDA positions which do not specify fill required by
     a JSO or JSO Nom. Selection for JDA duty will be determined by qualifications the officer pos-
     sesses to perform the required duty and JSO status. Manpower authorizations designated as JDA
     positions will be filled at a rate of 100% of authorized strength. NOTE: Not all positions autho-
     rized in joint activities are designated as JDA positions. The positions not designated as JDA
     positions are referred to as non-JDA positions/non-JDA assignments and are filled at a rate equal
     to the AF's worldwide average manning level or 100% whichever is less for the grade and AFSC
     required, unless otherwise agreed to by the joint activity.
        2.15.6.3.1. Joint activities are authorized to submit requisitions to fill authorized manpower
        positions. For assignment of lieutenant colonels and below, submit requisitions electronically
        through the Assignment Management System (AMS). For joint activities without AMS con-
        nectivity, use of the AF Form 934, Requisition for USAF Officer (or substitute DoD form) is
        authorized. These forms should be submitted by the requesting activity to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1
        (for non-JDA positions, submit requisitions to the appropriate assignment OPR). Requisitions
        should be submitted in accordance with established assignment cycles, normally 8 to 10
        months in advance of the required reporting date. If special training is required, for example,
        foreign language training, then advance the requisition due date by the length of the training.
        Requisitions submitted with less lead time must be justified and no assurance can be given that
        the reporting date will be met. Requisitions for assignment of colonels will be submitted as
        directed by AFCMO and for general officers, as directed by AFGOMO. The assignment
        OPRs are responsible for selection of individual officers for joint assignment. For assignment
        of officers in the grade of lieutenant colonel and below to or from JDA positions, the assign-
        ment OPRs will coordinate the assignments with HQ AFPC/DPAPP1.
        2.15.6.3.2. Requisitions to meet immediate requirements generated by unprogrammed losses
        or newly authorized positions may be submitted with less than 8 to 10 months lead time but
        should be submitted no less than 6 months before the requested reporting date. Requisitions
        submitted with less lead time must be further justified and no assurance can be given that the
        requested reporting date will be met.
        2.15.6.3.3. On receipt of the electronic requisition, the HQ AFPC assignment OPR for the
        AFSC takes action to select and assign a qualified officer and forward an officer career brief
        for the selectee at least 120 days before the reporting date, except for positions designated as
        nominative by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or OSD, Director of Administration
        and Management (OSD/DA&M). A nomination consists of a nomination memo, an officer
        career brief and copies of last five OPRs and a nomination must be forwarded at least 120 days
        before the reporting date. One nominee is provided per nominative position, except for
        assignment to the Office of the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, in which case two nominees
        per position are provided. There are no nominative positions on the staffs of Unified and
        Combatant Commands, the Defense Agencies or the DoD Field Activities (except for JTC3A).
        Whether a position is select and assign or nominative, the respective personnel office will
42                                            AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     advise the assignment OPR if the member is not suitable within 15 days of receipt of the
     officer career brief for select and assign positions, or within 15 days of receipt of the nomina-
     tion letter with attachments for nominative positions. An officer may be deemed unsuitable
     when he or she does not possess the mandatory qualifications stated on the requisition. The
     specific reason for a determination of unsuitable must be provided in writing (this function
     may be delegated) by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Principal Staff Assistant to
     the Secretary of Defense, the Unified and Combatant Command commanders, or the Director
     of the DoD Agency or Field Activity, through their respective personnel office to the assign-
     ment OPR.
     2.15.6.3.4. The Goldwater-Nichols DoD Reorganization Act of 1986 established the require-
     ment for an officer to serve in a SecDef designated JDA position to become eligible for con-
     sideration for promotion to brigadier general. This requirement applies to all officers except:
        2.15.6.3.4.1. Medical service officers (see Attachment 1, Definitions), chaplains, and
        judge advocates.
        2.15.6.3.4.2. Officers whose qualifications for promotion are based primarily on scientific
        and/or technical qualifications for which JDA positions do not exist in the joint arena when
        their proposed utilization as brigadier general will be in that specialty.
        2.15.6.3.4.3. The SecDef may grant a waiver of the JDA on a case-by-case basis in recog-
        nition of the limited number of qualifying billets available and the necessity of integrating
        this requirement within the assignment pattern of field grade and general officers with
        individual Service requirements.
        2.15.6.3.4.4. The tour of duty for members assigned to JDA positions as designated by
        SecDef within OSD, the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, DoD Field
        Activities, the Unified and Combatant Commands and the Defense Agencies for general
        officers is 2 years and 3 years for all other officers, unless otherwise specified by DoD pol-
        icy or arrangement with the AF. Officers in the grade of Lt Col and below assigned to JDA
        positions (CONUS or OS) will be placed in AAC 46 by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 according to
        Table 2.1. (Officers assigned to CONUS [only] in non-JDA positions will be assigned
        AAC 50 and the update will be accomplished by the servicing MPF. These members will
        be managed the same as other AF personnel serving on a CONUS maximum stabilized
        tour.) Extensions may be approved consistent with AF requirements and the career pro-
        gression of members, and when extension is not in conflict with statutory limitations. As
        stipulated in Title 10, U.S.C., Section 155(f), officers assigned to duty in the Office of the
        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff may not serve a tour of duty of more than 4 years
        unless such a tour is extended by approval of SecDef.
        2.15.6.3.4.5. All early releases from a designated JDA position, whether requested by the
        officer or the AF must be coordinated with the joint organization and HQ AFPC/DPAPP1.
        Coordination with the joint organization must be at the Director, J-1, or equivalent level, or
        with an official designated by the commander or head of the joint organization. It is criti-
        cal that members not depart prior to completion of the prescribed JDA tour. Early depar-
        ture from a joint duty assignment will affect the joint duty credit a member receives. The
        governing directive for JDA crediting is DoDI 1300.20. In cases where the joint activity
        does not agree with the release, resolution of the disagreement shall be addressed to the
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  43


            Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the ASD (FM&P), as appropriate. Officers in
            JDAs may be released before completing the prescribed tour length (2 years for general
            officers and 3 years for all other officers) under the following conditions:
                2.15.6.3.4.5.1. Early departure from a JDA by an officer with a Critical Occupation
                Specialty (COS)(11XX, 12XX, 13XX) may be approved when an officer is selected
                for a command assignment, Professional Military Education, career milestone assign-
                ment, or for return to duty in their COS. However, officers must serve a minimum of
                24 months to receive full joint duty credit.
                2.15.6.3.4.5.2. Officers serving an overseas JDA, including Alaska and Hawaii, where
                the accompanied by dependents tour length prescribed by DoDD 1315.7 (see Table
                3.1.) is 36 months, must serve the 36 month OS tour, or equivalent, regardless of mar-
                ital status or dependent status, to receive full JDA credit as a result of that OS assign-
                ment. At locations where the normal accompanied-by-dependents tour prescribed by
                DoDD 1315.7 (see Table 3.1.) is less than 36 months, officers who serve the full pre-
                scribed accompanied by dependents tour length (for example, 30 months or 24
                months), receive full JDA credit as a result of that OS assignment. However, officers
                who serve the unaccompanied tour length at locations where the accompanied tour
                length is less than 36 months, may PCS at the completion of the unaccompanied OS
                tour without a JDA tour length waiver, could still receive full JDA credit under cumu-
                lative credit provisions. An officer may receive cumulative full JDA credit if he or she
                had some JDA credit prior to going OS and that previous credit combined with the
                JDA credit for the OS assignment might result in satisfying the full JDA tour require-
                ment, or the OS JDA credit may be added to credit accumulated during a future JDA
                assignment. Upon assignment of officers to a JDA position OS, AAC 46 will be
                updated by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 (see Table 2.1.). For more information about joint
                officer management, see DoD Instruction 1300.20.
     2.15.6.4. Airmen - MAJCOM Headquarters Tours. Three year minimum stabilized tours (AAC
     44) are authorized for CONUS MAJCOM headquarters and MAJCOM staff element assignment
     for authorizations in the grades of TSgt (including SSgts assigned to TSgt authorizations) through
     CMSgt. Two year minimum tours (AAC 45) are authorized for SSgts (and above) who occupy
     SSgt authorizations. Deferment is not authorized below the grade of SSgt. Airmen not vulnerable
     for OS PCS selection may be assigned (PCA w/o PCS) to a MAJCOM headquarters on the same
     base without prior HQ AFPC approval. Deferment is not authorized for members assigned in
     excess of 100% of manpower authorizations.
  2.15.7. Stabilized Tour Assignment, Curtailment, Extension, and Completion.
     2.15.7.1. Stabilized Tour Assignment. A stabilized tour assignment and the accompanying defer-
     ment begins on the date a member is assigned to the unit or function authorized a stabilized tour.
     The date of assignment may or may not be the same as the date arrived station. See paragraph
     2.15.2. when assignment to a stabilized tour is proposed after a member's arrival on station. Train-
     ing during a stabilized tour, TDY, or other absences from duty do not change the tour completion
     date. TDY en route is not part of the tour.
     2.15.7.2. Stabilized Tour Curtailment. Unit and activity commanders and MAJCOMs have disap-
     proval authority for any curtailment request initiated at a lower level. A member may ask for cur-
44                                                AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     tailment of a stabilized tour by submitting a request to the unit commander. If the unit commander
     recommends approval, it must be forwarded to the activity commander. If supported by the activ-
     ity commander, the request is sent through the appropriate MAJCOM to the assignment OPR for
     consideration. Unit and activity commanders may request curtailment of stabilized tours (and
     reassignment) for members assigned to organizations they command. In all cases requests must
     contain the facts and circumstances and specify whether concurrent PCS is requested in conjunc-
     tion with tour curtailment. A request for PCS must include any necessary waivers of PCS eligibil-
     ity criteria and be originated at the appropriate level. In cases involving quality problems,
     curtailment and PCS will not be effected until appropriate administrative or disciplinary action has
     been taken unless an exception to policy is justified. Curtailment will not be considered only to
     make the member available for a specific job. Members curtailed are subject to selection for any
     assignment for which eligible, not just a specific position they want to volunteer for.
     2.15.7.3. Stabilized Tour Extension (Maximum Tours Only). A member may request voluntary
     extension to a stabilized tour no earlier than 15 months prior to tour completion. Also, an exten-
     sion request must be submitted prior to an ASD being established and the period of extension will
     normally not exceed 12 months at a time. Unit commanders and parent MAJCOMs (or equiva-
     lent) have disapproval authority. Commanders of activities which are subordinate to a MAJCOM
     determine if their field commanders may submit extension requests directly to the MAJCOM.
     When approval is recommended, the request is sent through the parent MAJCOM to the assign-
     ment OPR for consideration. Tour extensions do not apply to minimum tours.
     2.15.7.4. Stabilized Tour Completion. Actions taken upon completion of a stabilized tour vary
     depending on the type of tour served as follows:
        2.15.7.4.1. Upon completion of a minimum tour a member remains assigned until selected for
        voluntary or involuntary reassignment. The local commander or parent MAJCOM should
        establish procedures to periodically review the status of members who have completed their
        minimum tour to ensure continued assignment serves the overall best interest of the AF.
        Because of the importance of conserving PCS funds, stability and reduction of PCS turbu-
        lence, recommendations to reassign a member PCS must be fully justified on the basis of a
        requirement for fresh expertise, job stress, or personal hardships. Reassignment is not justified
        based on an arbitrary period of time.
        2.15.7.4.2. When completing a maximum tour a member is considered to be in a mandatory
        move status (either to another unit on the same station or PCS) and is normally reassigned
        upon completion of the initial tour, unless extended. A request to extend a maximum tour is
        submitted as provided in paragraph 2.15.7.3.
        2.15.7.4.3. A member assigned to a MAJCOM Inspector General travel team performing
        inspection duty is normally assigned other duties after 24 months. Reassignment is first con-
        sidered within the MAJCOM headquarters or to another unit on the same base. PCS may be
        considered when the member is the most eligible for PCS among others assigned to the same
        base. A request for extension of travel team inspection duty will be carefully considered with
        a view towards approval unless there are overriding reasons why extension does not serve the
        best overall interest of the AF. Members are not normally assigned involuntarily to travel team
        inspection duty within the 3 year period following a previous assignment to such duty. Excep-
        tions must be approved by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    45


       2.15.7.5. (Airmen Only) Minimum Tours in a Special Duty Identifier (SDI). In most cases, duty
       in an SDI is unrelated to an airman's PAFSC. Usually airmen are not retained in these duties for
       an extended period of time after completion of a minimum stabilized tour. To preclude loss of pro-
       ficiency in an airman’s AFSC, it is necessary to monitor the length of assignment of airmen
       assigned to minimum stabilized tours in SDIs and consecutive assignments in SDIs are not appro-
       priate.
           2.15.7.5.1. An airman performing duty in an SDI and who is assigned to a unit authorized a
           stabilized tour will be placed in the AAC prescribed for the unit or activity, or a lesser period
           when directed. Normally duty in an SDI does not, in itself, automatically involve deferment
           from reassignment, although in some instances all authorizations in a particular SDI may be in
           units authorized stabilized tours.
           2.15.7.5.2. About 12 months before their DOA, members receive a RIP giving them an oppor-
           tunity to volunteer for reassignment to return to duty in their PAFSC in conjunction with com-
           pletion of the stabilized tour. Airmen who desire reassignment are considered as follows:
               2.15.7.5.2.1. They will receive enhanced consideration for an OS assignment consistent
               with their OS volunteer status and vulnerability. If not matched to an OS requirement, they
               will be considered for assignment to a unit on the current duty station, or may be consid-
               ered for a CONUS assignment based on AF requirements, their preferences, eligibility, and
               so on.
           2.15.7.5.3. The RIP advises airmen they may remain assigned to their present duties and loca-
           tion upon completion of their initial minimum tour if they do not desire reassignment and AF
           requirements do not dictate reassignment. Should they decide at a later date they desire reas-
           signment (to return to their PAFSC), a minimum of 12 months notification before the date they
           desire reassignment is required. This date is the earliest they can normally expect to move;
           however, AF requirements could dictate shorter assignment notification. The RIPs require a
           member's signature and commander endorsement.
           2.15.7.5.4. Until a member is reassigned out of the SDI, the AAC and expired DOA of the ini-
           tial stabilized tour period remains in the PDS. The expired date is used to generate an annual
           RIP on the anniversary of completion of the initial minimum stabilized tour period. This anni-
           versary RIP reiterates the options for reassignment or to remain assigned, and also requires the
           member's signature and commander endorsement.
           2.15.7.5.5. The signed RIP (initial or anniversary) is filed in the Unit Personnel Record Group
           (UPRG) until the member is reassigned or until it is superseded by a subsequent RIP.
           2.15.7.5.6. When the MPF receives an initial RIP where the member requests reassignment,
           they report the airman in AAC 50 with DOA equal to the minimum tour completion date.
           When a member requests reassignment on an anniversary RIP, the DOA will be 12 months
           from the date of the commander's endorsement.
           2.15.7.5.7. The assignment authority can determine the appropriate order in which to align a
           member in an SDI who desires reassignment by comparing the DAS, date assigned duty in the
           SDI, the expired AAC, and the AAC 50 expiration date.

2.16. Assignment Limitation Code (ALC). An ALC may be permanent or semi-permanent. They dif-
fer from AACs and can broadly restrict or limit the selection of members for assignment to or from certain
46                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


duties or areas, and the limitation is usually of such duration that it applies longer than just to the current
duty assignment or location. Normally, limitations which apply only to a current assignment or location
are managed by an AAC, although exceptions to use an ALC may be made. These limitations are used to
alert personnel managers of long term constraints on assignment or utilization of members based on their
physical condition, security status, military status, family situation, and other reasons. Table 2.2. lists the
various types of assignment limitations and their codes. A waiver to any ALC requires the advance
approval of HQ AFPC/DPAPP unless Table 2.2. lists a specific OPR .

2.17. Medical Deferment or Limitation. Worldwide commitments require every member to be physi-
cally qualified for immediate global deployment, except as indicated below.
     2.17.1. Temporary Medical Deferment. A member may be temporarily deferred from PCS or TDY
     when accepted medical principles make it evident that a physical defect which prevents worldwide
     service is temporary and should be cleared within 12 months. When an authorized official at the Med-
     ical Treatment Facility (MTF) sends the MPF an AF Form 422, Physical Profile Serial Report,
     which contains a "4T" in the "Revised" line of Section II, Profile Serial (PULHESX), the MPF enters
     AAC "31" (see Table 2.1.) in the PDS when the availability date is 90 calendar days or more after the
     date of the AF Form 422. Do not enter deferments of less than 90 calendar days. The MPF must ver-
     ify the assignment availability date with the MTF 30 calendar days before expiration. The availability
     date will not exceed and will not be extended beyond 12 months from the date when the underlying
     defect was deemed, or clearly should have been deemed, disqualifying for worldwide duty (AFI
     48-123). When a member is scheduled for a mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1) while temporarily
     medically deferred from PCS, the MTF officials must make the determination whether the member
     will proceed on PCS and can be evaluated and/or treated upon arrival at the next duty station, or
     whether the member must be evaluated and/or treated at current station. When the MPF receives writ-
     ten notice from the MTF that a member must be evaluated at current station, the MPF will reclama the
     assignment to the assignment OPR (see paragraph 2.47.). Upon receipt of the reclama, if necessary,
     the assignment OPR may request assistance from HQ AFPC/DPAMM, Medical Standards Branch, to
     determine the appropriate assignment action to take based upon the medical circumstances.
     2.17.2. Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) and Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) Deferment. When a
     member has a physical limitation which may not be temporary, the MTF provides the MPF and HQ
     AFPC/DPAMM an AF Form 422 indicating that an MEB, which could result in a PEB, is being pro-
     cessed. If the member is in AAC 31, Table 2.1., Medical Deferment, then remove the AAC 31 and
     replace it with AAC 37, Medical Evaluation Board (MEB) or Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) (see
     Table 2.1.). Per AFI 36-3212, Physical Evaluation for Retention, Retirement and Separations, and
     AFPD 41-1, a member pending an MEB or PEB may not be reassigned PCS or TDY (or granted leave
     outside the local area, separated, or retired) until the MTF determines the medical disposition. If cir-
     cumstances arise regarding the assignment status of a member pending an MEB or PEB, for example,
     for a member serving OS it appears the DEROS will expire before a final determination is made, then
     the MPF will advise the assignment OPR by message and provide complete details. The MPF will
     provide an information copy to HQ AFPC/DPAMM, HQ AFPC/DPPDS, and HQ AFPC/DPAPP1.
     Guidance will be provided as appropriate. NOTE: An AAC does not preclude a member from sepa-
     rating or retiring; these personnel actions must be monitored by other means. There is no authority in
     this instruction to involuntarily extend a member's DEROS for medical reasons. When appropriate
     medical authority determines a member is not medically cleared for PCS, then the DEROS of mem-
     bers serving OS will be allowed to expire (but they must be retained in place). When members are
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    47


   medically cleared for PCS near or after their DEROS, the MPF will advise the assignment OPR of the
   circumstances and request assignment disposition. Provide an information copy of these requests to
   HQ AFPC/DPAMM and HQ AFPC/DPAPP1.
   2.17.3. Medical Assignment Limitation (Code "C"). Sometimes the result of a PEB is for the mem-
   ber to remain on active duty, but carefully manage his or her future assignments. In such cases, HQ
   AFPC/DPAMM will input and manage ALC "C," Medical Assignment Limitation (see Table 2.2.).
   Before an assignment OPR finalizes or updates an assignment selection on a member with this limita-
   tion, approval of HQ AFPC/DPAMM is required. HQ AFPC/DPAMM will review the member's
   medical case file and determine if the assignment is consistent with the member's medical require-
   ments and limitations. If the member's medical circumstances preclude the assignment, the assign-
   ment OPR will be advised and the member will not be selected for that particular assignment.

2.18. Officers Not Selected for Promotion.
   2.18.1. Lieutenant Colonels Not Selected for Promotion to Colonel. Selection for promotion to colo-
   nel is the result of an extremely competitive process and nonselection for promotion to colonel is nor-
   mally not a basis for PCS ineligibility. Senior managers must use this highly qualified resource to the
   best advantage of the AF in positions commensurate with their grade and qualifications. However,
   because of the mandatory retirement date a lieutenant colonel receives based on grade, the lack of the
   required retainability for PCS and/or retainability to serve the associated ADSC may preclude consid-
   eration for some assignments.
   2.18.2. Officers Not Selected for Promotion to Lieutenant Colonel or Major. Nonselection for pro-
   motion to lieutenant colonel or major does not, in itself, render a member ineligible for PCS. How-
   ever, nonselection for promotion can affect consideration for PCS or other events as explained below.
      2.18.2.1. Officers in the grade of major or captain are ineligible for PCS when they have a man-
      datory DOS or mandatory retirement date established as a result of nonselection for promotion
      which is less than the minimum retainability for PCS, unless a waiver (see paragraph 1.4.) of
      retainability or exception to policy (see paragraph 1.5.) is approved. See paragraph 2.29. for addi-
      tional guidance on retainability.
      2.18.2.2. Officers in the grades of major or captain who have been nonselected for promotion to
      the next higher grade and have the minimum retainability (that is, have not had a mandatory DOS
      or retirement date established and still have an indefinite DOS) may be considered for PCS or
      other events. However, even though these officers have retainability, when it cannot be assured
      the AF will receive full return in terms of service for PCS funds, education or training costs, etc.,
      (for example, in the event of a second nonselection for promotion resulting in establishment of a
      mandatory DOS or mandatory retirement date), then selection of these officers for PCS or other
      events must be kept to an absolute minimum. Therefore, nonselection for promotion can affect
      consideration for PCS or other events based on the resulting limit on retainability or potential limit
      on retainability.
   2.18.3. Officers Selected For or En Route to an Event. When an officer is nonselected for promotion,
   the officer's status must be quickly evaluated on a case-by- case basis by the assignment OPR. This
   includes officers scheduled for an event such as PCS, education or training (that is, officer has a
   DEROS, will PCS upon completion of training, etc.); those selected for PCS, education or training
   (including those who have departed); and those attending such events (for example, TDY and return)
48                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     in conjunction with PCS. The member, supervisors, the losing/gaining commanders, MAJCOM
     assignment functions, and the MPF share the responsibility to assist the assignment OPR or selection
     authority in identifying officers selected for PCS or other events who are nonselected for promotion.
     The MPF will reclama (see paragraph 2.47.) to the assignment OPR or selection authority and request
     disposition instructions. The reclama must include details such as date notified of nonselection,
     whether or not the officer has departed, whether cancellation will create a hardship, the basis for the
     hardship and how it is considered to be uncommon to others in similar circumstances, status of ship-
     ment of HHGs, location of dependents, officer's desires, and so on. Because each case is different, it
     is not possible to state what will happen in all cases. For example, officers completing an OS tour may
     or may not have PCS retainability for a CONUS assignment, so they may or may not be extended in
     place depending on their accompanied status, their DEROS, and other factors.
     2.18.4. Other Circumstances. The action to be taken varies for officers selected for PCS, formal edu-
     cation, or training who subsequently have their promotion delayed (includes officers delayed pending
     removal from a promotion list), and officers found not qualified for promotion to first lieutenant. In
     such cases, the MPF must reclama (see paragraph 2.47.) the selection to the assignment OPR by mes-
     sage and provide the details and commander's recommendation so that a determination can be made if
     participation in the projected event is appropriate.

2.19. Dependent Care. All military members must ensure arrangements are made for care of their
dependents when they must be separated due to TDY or PCS. Members who cannot or will not meet mil-
itary commitments due to family needs will be considered for discharge.
     2.19.1. Military Couples with Dependents and Single Member Sponsors. Military couples with
     dependents and single member sponsors are expected to fulfill their military obligations on the same
     basis as other members of the AF. They are eligible for worldwide duty and all assignments for which
     they qualify including TDY or PCS to imminent danger or hostile fire areas. To ensure military cou-
     ples with dependents and single member sponsors are available for worldwide duty, they must have
     workable plans to provide parent-like care for their dependents when the requirements of military ser-
     vice require separation from their dependents. Dependent care plan requirements are prescribed by
     AFI 36-2908, Family Care Plans. When a member has a dependent care plan that won't work, com-
     manders will require the member to develop a workable plan. To assist, commanders will consider
     approving leave for the member and, as necessary, direct the member to receive counseling on the cri-
     teria for humanitarian deferment or reassignment, or hardship discharge depending on the duration
     and severity of the problem. If the member cannot or will not develop an adequate dependent care
     plan, the commander will process the member for discharge in accordance with applicable directives
     or, if eligible, they may be given an opportunity to apply for immediate retirement.
     2.19.2. Members Adopting Children.
        2.19.2.1. A single member sponsor or one member of a military couple may be authorized defer-
        ment from PCS or TDY during the 4-month period following the date a child is officially placed
        in the member's home as part of the official adoption process. The intent is to avoid involuntary
        separation of the member and child to facilitate bonding. When a child has been in the member's
        home for some time prior to the official adoption process or a bonding period is not necessary for
        other reasons, the member may decide not to request a 4-month deferment. During the 4-month
        period following placement as stated above, a single member sponsor or one member of a military
        couple may be deferred up to 4 months from assignment to an OS location if concurrent travel is
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 49


       denied (regardless of the tour length), or where the unaccompanied tour length is less than 18
       months and the member is not permitted to serve the accompanied by dependents tour. As neces-
       sary, the member may also be counseled on humanitarian assignment or deferment as outlined in
       Attachment 7. This deferment is separate from any other humanitarian deferment the member
       may be granted in connection with adoption.
       2.19.2.2. Members who qualify for and desire the 4-month deferment must provide a statement
       from adoption authorities endorsed by the member's unit commander showing the date member
       initiated formal adoption proceedings and the date the child was officially placed in the member's
       home incident to the adoption application. Commanders or MPF Commanders may request assis-
       tance from their servicing legal office if any question exists on the adequacy of the statement or
       eligibility of a member under this paragraph. Deferments will not be approved in advance of
       placement of a child in the member's home as described above.
       2.19.2.3. Upon approval of deferment by the MPF Commander (or designated representative), the
       MPF will update assignment limitation code "A," Post Delivery Deferment/Adoption Deferment
       (see Table 2.2.). The member's deployment availability code (DAC) will automatically update
       from the assignment limitation code "A" update.

2.20. Assignment of Family Members to Command or Supervisory Positions. Assignment of fam-
ily members to the same duty location or unit is not prohibited, however, family members will not be
assigned where one member will or may hold a command or supervisory position over another family
member. Such assignments result in, or may create a perception of, preferential treatment or loss of
impartiality, thereby compromising the integrity of command and supervisory functions. Family member
is defined as spouse, brother, sister, parent, or child. Relationships other than command and supervisory
(for example, a member has court martial jurisdiction over a family member), and other circumstances
(such as command or supervision over a former spouse) may be considered on a case-by-case basis. For
additional family member assignment considerations, see Attachment 5, Attachment 6, Attachment 7,
Attachment 8, Attachment 9, and Attachment 11.
   2.20.1. When such situations occur they should be resolved at base level if possible. When both
   members hold an AFSC that requires them to be assigned to the same unit or function, the MPF, work-
   ing with the unit commanders, initiates action to reassign one member to another unit or function on
   base in an additional AFSC. If neither member possesses an additional AFSC which can be effec-
   tively used on base, then the circumstances will be reported expeditiously as outlined below for reso-
   lution. When a question of propriety of assignment in circumstances other than those outlined herein
   exists, the case may be forwarded as outlined below for consideration as an exception. Send the case
   through the MAJCOM (or equivalent) to HQ AFPC/DPAPP and include the following information:
       2.20.1.1. Grade, name, and SSN of members involved.
       2.20.1.2. Family relationship.
       2.20.1.3. Circumstances that resulted in the command or supervision of one family member by
       another (marriage, join spouse, humanitarian/EFMP assignment, school assignment, and so on).
       2.20.1.4. Efforts to resolve the case at base and MAJCOM (or equivalent) level.
       2.20.1.5. Recommendation of local commander and MAJCOM Director of Personnel (DP).
       2.20.1.6. Each member’s PCS volunteer status and location preferences.
50                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


2.21. Officer/Enlisted and Senior/Junior Member PCS Considerations. F o r P C S c o n s i d e r a t i o n
where one member is an officer and the other is enlisted, primary consideration will be for the officer’s
utilization. For PCS considerations where both members are officers or both are enlisted, utilization will
be determined on a case-by-case basis based on the needs of the AF. Exceptions may be considered on a
case-by-case basis per paragraph 1.5.

2.22. First Assignment After Commissioning (From Enlisted Status). As the first assignment follow-
ing commissioning, officers commissioned from enlisted status will not be assigned in permanent party
status back to the last base at which they served in enlisted status. Such an assignment is permitted in stu-
dent status (that is, formal student status, not on-the-job training). For example, if an enlisted member
stationed at Base A becomes a commissioned officer, he or she will not be assigned back to Base A for
their first permanent party assignment after commissioning. This does not preclude assignment as a stu-
dent if Base A also happens to be the training location for initial skill training for the officer’s specialty.

2.23. Assignment of Former Officers. Former officers who enlist may remain assigned to the same per-
manent duty station to which they were assigned immediately prior to enlistment if there is a requirement
for their grade/AFSC, and other assignment considerations support continued assignment.

2.24. Soliciting an Assignment. Members should not solicit reassignment, other than via voluntary PCS
applications and requests authorized by this instruction, other AF instructions, a member’s assignment
preference statement, or when members respond to a request for volunteers for a specific requirement.
This does not preclude a member from inquiring about their assignment status through authorized inquiry
channels. Because requirements and the factors which affect a member’s relative standing for PCS selec-
tion change, members who inquire through authorized channels regarding their vulnerability for PCS will
normally not be given a numerical standing.

2.25. Time on Station (TOS) Requirements. The purpose of a minimum TOS requirement is to
enhance operational readiness by stabilizing members at their current location, to reduce PCS costs, and
to improve the quality of life of members and their dependents by reducing personal and family turbu-
lence. Table 2.3. reflects the minimum TOS requirements for PCS and certain in-place actions. See para-
graph 2.26. for guidance on PCS departure date. EXCEPTION: For officer JDA assignments, the
minimum TOS to receive full JDA tour credit is computed differently than normal TOS. For example, if
DAS is 15 Jan 96 and the TOS minimum is 3 years, then officer meets the minimum on 14 Jan 99.
     2.25.1. TOS is computed on a month-to-month basis; not on the number of days. Compute TOS by
     adding the required period to the month and year of date arrived station (DAS). EXAMPLE: If DAS
     is any day of the month in Jan 98 and the TOS minimum is 3 years, then Jan 98 counts as the first
     month. The member meets the 3 year TOS minimum on 1 Jan 01. For all PCS moves, the TOS
     requirement must have been met by the departure date, unless a waiver or an exception has been
     approved. When a member has TDY en route in conjunction with a PCS, the minimum TOS require-
     ment must be met prior to departure on TDY.
     2.25.2. For CONUS to CONUS PCS, when more than one member meets the assignment qualifica-
     tions, the member with the longest TOS should be selected when there are no other overriding consid-
     erations. An example of an overriding consideration would be the goal to equitably distribute OS
     assignments. When a member who has the longest TOS is also vulnerable for involuntary OS assign-
     ment, then OS vulnerability would override the fact the member also has the longest TOS. Another
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                      51


   example of an overriding consideration is if selection of the member with the longest TOS would
   require backfill and generate an additional CONUS to CONUS PCS of similar urgency. Also see
   paragraph 2.10., Volunteer Status and PCS Eligibility.
   2.25.3. Waivers may be requested on a case-by-case basis as prescribed in paragraph 1.4. A TOS
   waiver must be requested by a general or flag officer or equivalent Federal civilian grade (including
   officers of the Foreign Service of the Department of State), or a colonel in a wing commander posi-
   tion, or equivalent. (Equivalent is defined as a person, military or civilian, designated as a senior rater
   and serving in the grade of colonel or higher, or equivalent civilian grade.) Requesters must actually
   be serving in the prescribed military rank or civilian grade (for example, the requester cannot be a
   lieutenant colonel selected for colonel). Requests for exceptions, including those which require a
   waiver, may be submitted on a case-by-case basis as prescribed in paragraph 1.5.

2.26. PCS Departure Date and Port Call Date. A member’s PCS departure date is determined accord-
ing to Table 2.4. and the instructions below and must be approved by a member’s commander or unit offi-
cial a commander may authorize to approve PCS departure dates. For planning purposes only, the
assignment OPR includes in each PCS selection a projected departure date (PDD). When the actual PCS
departure date is determined, that date is entered into the PDS as the PDD. The timing of PCS departure
in relation to the RNLTD, a TDY en route reporting date, training class start date, port reporting date (if
applicable) and the amount of travel time authorized or used determines how much leave a member will
be charged in connection with the PCS. When a course of instruction is involved, see paragraph 2.26.5.
and Table 4.1. Compliance with the RNLTD, port reporting date, or other reporting dates (whether they
are not later than dates or not earlier than dates) is mandatory. Members must carefully plan their depar-
ture date, travel and leave so they will not be charged with unwanted leave or incur unexpected expenses
while waiting to report as directed. Members who report contrary to instructions may be accommodated
and allowed to terminate their leave status, but they could also be subjected to disciplinary action for fail-
ure to comply with their reporting instructions.
   2.26.1. For CONUS to CONUS PCS. To determine the PCS departure date, subtract from the
   RNLTD the number of days leave the commander approves, maximum allowable travel time, and any
   other period the member may be authorized en route. When a member has TDY en route, then in
   addition to the above, also subtract the number of days TDY. Members must meet the minimum TOS
   for PCS before the departure date. When TDY en route is involved, then the minimum TOS must be
   met before departure on TDY. At the commander's discretion, a member may be allowed to depart up
   to a maximum of 60 days prior to RNLTD, provided on that date a member meets the minimum TOS
   for PCS. Members will not be permitted to depart on PCS from a CONUS station earlier than 60 days
   prior to the RNLTD without prior approval of the assignment OPR (except as authorized in Table 2.4.,
   rule 7). Approval by the assignment OPR will be in the form of a change to the RNLTD which, in
   turn, changes the earliest date the member can depart. The change of RNLTD will also reset
   PCS-related suspense flags and assist the MPF in monitoring processing for PCS.
        EXAMPLE: If an RNLTD is 31 Dec 97 (Julian date of 365) and the member requests 30 days
   leave en route and is authorized 7 days travel time, then subtract 37 from 365 which equals a Julian
   date of 328 (or 24 Nov 97). The PCS departure date is 24 Nov 97. Commanders may permit members
   to depart up to 60 days prior to the RNLTD provided on that date the member meets the minimum
   TOS for PCS. To compute the maximum earliest departure date authorized without an RNLTD
   change, subtract 60 from the Julian date of 365 (31 Dec 97) which is Julian date 305, or 1 Nov 97.
52                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     However, in this example, if the member had a DAS in Dec 94, then he or she would be restricted to a
     departure date of not earlier than 1 Dec 97 which is the date minimum TOS is satisfied.
     2.26.2. For CONUS to OS PCS. Use the procedure above to initially determine the departure date
     and confirm that on that date members satisfy the minimum TOS requirement. Members will not be
     permitted to depart on PCS without a firm port call. The servicing MPF requests flight reservations
     (port call) from the Transportation Management Office (TMO) as outlined in AFI 36-2102,
     Base-Level Relocation Procedures. Upon receipt of a firm port call, that date can be used (in lieu of
     the RNLTD) to compute a more accurate departure date. The 60 day maximum window before the
     RNLTD is normally adequate to accommodate the departure date the member desires in relation to the
     port call date received. MPFs will not request, and TMOs will not schedule, a member’s port call
     earlier than the first day of the RNLTD month, unless the member has leave in an OS area approved
     by the commander per AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program and the leave authorization and leave
     address are included in PCS orders. Flight reservations must ensure the member will be in place at the
     OS duty station on or before the RNLTD. Flight reservations where a member departs on the RNLTD
     are acceptable if the scheduled transportation provides for the member's arrival at the OS duty station
     on the RNLTD. The TMO may schedule a member's port call on any day during the reporting month
     which meets the RNLTD. For example, if an RNLTD is 10 Jun 98, a port call date of 31 May 98 is not
     acceptable because that date is earlier than the first day of the RNLTD month. If the RNLTD is 10 Jun
     98, reservations which have the member departing on 10 Jun 98, but arriving on 11 Jun 98 are not
     acceptable. If an RNLTD is 30 Jun 98, the member may state a preference for movement during the
     10 day window of 21-30 Jun 98. However, it may not be possible to provide transportation during the
     preferred period, so the member could be given a port call date such as 12 Jun 98. The 12 Jun 98 port
     call date is acceptable because it satisfies the requirement to report before the 30 Jun 98 RNLTD and
     the requirement that the port call not be earlier than the first day of the RNLTD month.
     2.26.3. For PCS OS to CONUS. The PCS departure date must be within the member's DEROS
     month (unless the DEROS was allowed to expire due to the member being on international hold, in
     confinement, or not being medically qualified for assignment [see Table 3.12.]). A departure date
     prior to the DEROS month requires approval of curtailment of OS tour. Departure after the DEROS
     month requires an extension of OS tour, unless the member is authorized leave in the OS area and the
     leave is authorized in PCS orders. For operational reasons, commanders may retain a member at the
     OS duty station up to the last day of the DEROS month. With a unit commander's concurrence, MPFs
     may schedule a member for departure on any day during the DEROS month to ensure maximum use
     of transportation. When PCS is to a course of instruction, see paragraph 2.26.5.
     2.26.4. For PCS OS to OS. The PCS departure date must be within the member's DEROS month. A
     departure date prior to the DEROS month requires approval of curtailment of OS tour. Departure after
     the DEROS month requires an extension of OS tour, unless the member is authorized leave in the OS
     area and the leave is authorized in PCS orders. The port call for PCS travel to the new OS duty station
     cannot be earlier than the first day of the RNLTD month unless the member has leave approved in the
     OS area. To comply with these requirements may require adjustment of departure within the DEROS
     month, extension or curtailment of DEROS month, and/or change of the RNLTD depending on the
     amount of leave the member desires en route and other variables. MPFs may request extension or cur-
     tailment of DEROS in such cases directly to the assignment OPR and include the gaining and losing
     MAJCOMs and gaining MPF. For operational reasons, commanders may retain members at the cur-
     rent OS duty station up to the last day of the DEROS month. With a unit commander's concurrence,
     MPFs may schedule a member for departure on any day during the DEROS month to ensure maxi-
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                   53


   mum use of transportation. When TDY en route to a course of instruction is involved, see paragraph
   2.26.5.
   2.26.5. For PCS Involving a Course of Instruction. Also see paragraph 4.5. and Table 4.1. PCS or
   TDY en route to courses of instruction may stipulate a “report not earlier than date,” or a requirement
   to “depart not later than one day after graduation.” Either of these requirements along with the limita-
   tions associated with the member's DEROS, port call date, and/or RNLTD can result in a conflict of
   mandatory reporting requirements or the potential for a member having to take unwanted leave.
   When requirements conflict or it appears a member might be forced to take unwanted leave, the MPF
   will review Table 4.1. with special attention to the notes and, when necessary, advise the assignment
   OPR and include the member's desired travel/leave arrangements and any other pertinent information.
   The assignment OPR will review the circumstances and make changes as appropriate.
   2.26.6. Officer Joint Duty Assignments. For PCS involving JDA officers, also see paragraph 2.15.
   and Table 2.4. A departure date prior to completion of the full JDA tour (to the day) is not authorized
   unless the request is coordinated through the joint organization (Director, J-1 or equivalent) and HQ
   AFPC/DPAPP1. Failure to coordinate could result in the officer not receiving joint duty credit.

2.27. Report Not Later Than Date (RNLTD)/Report Not Earlier Than Date (RNETD).
   2.27.1. RNLTD. The RNLTD is established as outlined in Table 2.4. and in accordance with the fol-
   lowing additional instructions. Do not deviate from these instructions or Table 2.4. without specific
   approval of the assignment OPR or approval of an exception per paragraph 1.5.
      2.27.1.1. RNLTDs are established primarily based on manning requirements. For the majority of
      assignments within the CONUS or to OS, the RNLTD is the last day of the requirement month.
      When mission essential, a reporting date earlier than the last day of the requirement month may be
      directed by the assignment OPR. For assignments OS, a reporting date of the 10th of the month is
      authorized when overlap with key or supervisory personnel is mission essential and incumbents
      will be retained until the end of their DEROS month. A 10th of the month RNLTD will not be
      established arbitrarily as a requirement for all personnel being assigned to an OS location, unless
      an exception has been approved by HQ AFPC/DPAPP. An RNLTD earlier than the 10th of the
      month will not be established for PCS OS unless an exception has been approved by HQ AFPC/
      DPAPP. NOTE: An RNLTD earlier than the 10th of the month for an OS assignment does not
      allow sufficient flexibility in transportation scheduling and may result in having to schedule mem-
      bers at commercial airline rates when a less costly military contract passenger flight a few days
      later could have been used.
      2.27.1.2. TMOs schedule members so they are in place at their OS duty station by the established
      RNLTD. See paragraph 2.26.
      2.27.1.3. A RNLTD for an OS assignment will not be established which requires reporting to a
      port between 20 Dec and 5 Jan of the following year, unless there are overriding military consid-
      erations. The fact that a member does not object or wants to travel during this period is not a fac-
      tor. A fewer than normal number of military passenger flights are scheduled during this period.
      This increases the likelihood of having to support PCS travel via civilian commercial airlines. In
      addition to being more costly, it is often difficult to obtain civilian reservations because flights
      during this period are full so far in advance. Members can also encounter severe problems in
      securing civilian air travel to their port of departure.

     2.27.2. RNETD. An RNETD may be directed and will be included by the MPF in PCS orders when
     it is essential that a member not arrive at a TDY or PCS location earlier than the established date. An
     RNETD may be necessary for a variety of reasons such as quarters may not exist sooner, or unneces-
     sary costs to the government and/or member might result when members arrive early. Similar to an
     RNLTD, members who arrive earlier than the established RNETD are not in compliance with their
     written orders. Therefore, it is important for members, commanders, and MPFs to carefully manage
     departure from current station. To avoid unwanted leave and/or personal expense or hardship, mem-
     bers should carefully plan their departure from current station and arrange to meet other personal and
     dependent requirements consistent with the RNETD. When members indicate compliance with a
     RNETD will constitute an undue hardship or for some other reasons they desire a change or deletion
     of the RNETD, they should submit a request for change through their unit commander to the MPF.
     The MPF will use the reclama procedures shown in paragraph 2.47. to advise the assignment OPR and
     request resolution.

2.28. Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC). The ADSC serves as a personnel management and
control system to help maintain a trained and experienced force. It is used to assist in ensuring the AF
receives a return in terms of active service for training, education, or PCS movement of members. The
ADSC is a key element in personal and career plans. The MPF will advise members when they are
selected for an ADSC-incurring event as prescribed in AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Commitments (ADSC)
and Specified Period of Time Contracts (SPTC). See paragraph 2.29. on retainability. Accordingly, offic-
ers acknowledge or decline ADSC(s) on AF Form 63, Officer/Enlisted Active Duty Service Commit-
ment Acknowledgment Statement, unless otherwise prescribed in AFI 36-2107, and enlisted
acknowledge ADSCs on AF Form 63, but decline to obtain retainability for an ADSC on AF Form 964.

2.29. Retainability Requirements. Retainability is obligated active military service. DoD and the AF
prescribe minimum retainability requirements for PCS to ensure the AF receives repayment for the costs
associated with PCS, training, or other actions, to provide mission continuity at the gaining unit, to pro-
vide stability to members and their families after PCS, or to satisfy some other AF requirement. In addi-
tion, the AF has established retainability requirements for approval of certain voluntary actions which
allow members to remain in place. Use this paragraph in conjunction with Table 2.5., PCS Retainability
Requirements, which establishes the minimum retainability required for most PCSs and in-place actions,
and Table 2.6., Separation and Retirement Date Minimums for OS PCS Selection, which establishes the
minimum PCS retainability normally required in conjunction with OS assignments. The amount of
retainability a person has or is eligible to obtain after completion of a particular OS tour is, in certain
cases, a factor in eligibility for OS PCS. These requirements are reflected in Table 2.6. whenever appli-
cable. The retainability policies and procedures for officers and airmen have many similarities, but there
are significant differences. The differences are addressed below in separate paragraphs for officers and
airmen.
     2.29.1. Computing Retainability. Compute retainability on a month to month basis, not the actual
     number of days. For PCS CONUS to CONUS, CONUS to OS, and OS to OS, add the number of
     months retainability required to the RNLTD (month and year only). For example, if a RNLTD is any
     day in Jun 98 and the retainability requirement is 24 months, then the person requires retainability of
     at least 1 Jun 00 (00 is the year 2000). For PCS OS to CONUS, add the number of months retainabil-
     ity required to the member’s DEROS (month and year only). For example, if the member’s DEROS
     is any day in Sep 98 and the retainability required is 12 months, then the person requires retainability
     of 1 Sep 99, or after.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    55


  2.29.2. Retainability Waiver or Exception. A waiver (see paragraph 1.4.) or an exception (see para-
  graph 1.5.) to the minimum required retainability may be requested on a case-by-case basis. Group or
  blanket waivers or exceptions will not be considered. When necessary, assignment OPRs may origi-
  nate waivers or exceptions in order to direct the PCS of members with less than the normal minimum
  required retainability. Assignment OPRs will normally include the fact that a retainability waiver or
  exception to policy has been approved in the PCS instructions. Failure to include this approval infor-
  mation in PCS instructions can delay the assignment process because the MPF should reclama selec-
  tion of members who have insufficient retainability. For airmen (only) delays in obtaining
  retainability may be considered according to paragraph 2.29.11.
  2.29.3. Retainability and PCS Entitlements. Members will not be permitted to use PCS entitlements
  without the full prescribed PCS retainability, unless an individual retainability waiver or exception to
  policy has been approved. (As an exception, FTA retraining in conjunction with CAREERS attending
  retraining in a TDY en route status may depart on PCS and use entitlements provided they reenlist
  prior to departing the training site according to the procedures outlined in Table 2.7., note 6.) One
  way MPFs can preclude members from using PCS entitlements without full retainability is to with-
  hold issuance of PCS orders until the member satisfies the retainability requirement; other ways are
  acceptable as long as they are effective. Following are some examples of how members may be
  affected.
     2.29.3.1. Officers who request a follow-on PCS agree to the PCS ADSC when they are advised of
     selection for the follow-on PCS, but the follow-on PCS ADSC is not normally updated in the Per-
     sonnel Data System (PDS) until an officer arrives at the follow-on location. When officers use
     any of the entitlements associated with a follow-on PCS, then, at that time, they incur the fol-
     low-on PCS ADSC, regardless of when the ADSC is actually updated in the PDS.
     2.29.3.2. Airmen who want to use PCS entitlements, (for example for a COT), must have the full
     required retainability for the COT and will incur the PCS ADSC at the time they use entitlements,
     regardless of when the ADSC is actually updated in the PDS.
     2.29.3.3. Airmen (only) may request a delay in obtaining PCS retainability as authorized in para-
     graph 2.29.6.8. and Table 2.7. However, a delay may be granted only up to the point in time when
     airmen desire to use PCS entitlements. Airmen may have to choose or compromise between the
     benefit they accrue from a delay in obtaining retainability and their desire to use PCS entitlements
     for which they must have full retainability.
  2.29.4. Retainability Requirements Longer than the PCS Minimums. Some officer and airman
  assignments require longer retainability than the normal PCS minimum. For example, when an
  officer is assigned to a stabilized tour, the service retainability requirement is equal to the stabilized
  tour length. For an officer, consult the Stabilized Tour Guide (see paragraph 2.15.6.) to determine if
  assignment is to a stabilized tour. In other instances, for both officers and airmen, the assignment
  instructions or a PPC will identify when a longer retainability requirement applies. The longer
  requirement becomes the minimum for that assignment. Establishment of a minimum retainability
  requirement longer than normal PCS retainability requires advance approval by HQ AFPC/DPAPP.
  Longer retainability requirements may be waived by the assignment authority, the assignment OPR,
  the gaining MAJCOM (or equivalent), or gaining unit. A member who refuses to satisfy the longer
  retainability requirement will be processed as shown below in the same manner as members who
  refuse to obtain the normal minimum retainability. Members who refuse to satisfy the longer retain-
  ability requirement may still be assigned if the longer requirement is waived.
56                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     2.29.5. Officers. Upon selection for an event such as PCS which requires an ADSC (see AFI 36-2107
     for ADSC incurring events), the MPF will determine whether or not officers have or can obtain the
     minimum retainability. For PCS selection, see Table 2.5. and/or Table 2.6., and/or the ADSC(s)
     requirement stated in the event or PCS notification. Officers (including noncareer officers) who have
     an indefinite DOS are considered as having indefinite retainability. (See paragraph 2.18. for officers
     nonselected for promotion.) When officers have an established DOS or approved retirement date,
     use that date to compute retainability. NOTE: Expiration of an ADSC is not a DOS. Having or
     nearing 20 or more years total active federal military service (TAFMS) is not the same as an approved
     retirement date. The assignment OPR (or other authority depending on the event) will include the
     length of ADSC in the assignment transaction trailer remarks or in message notification, or may refer-
     ence the applicable table and rule in AFI 36-2107 for computation of the ADSC by the MPF. Officers
     must be informed of the ADSC for an event or PCS (see paragraph 2.32., PCS Notification).
        2.29.5.1. For PCS or other ADSC-incurring event, the MPF will determine an officer's retainabil-
        ity status. When officers have retainability (either because they have an indefinite DOS, or when
        they have an established DOS or retirement date which satisfies the minimum retainability) and:
            2.29.5.1.1. Accept the PCS or event and the associated ADSC, then officers acknowledge
            selection and the MPF advises HQ AFPC of PCS notification (see paragraph 2.32., PCS Noti-
            fication).
            2.29.5.1.2. Want to decline the PCS, event and/or associated ADSC, and:
                2.29.5.1.2.1. Have an indefinite DOS. Then the MPF will advise the officer that he or she
                must sign and submit a request to establish a DOS or retirement date, if eligible, according
                to the 7-day option provisions in paragraph 2.37. Officers who have retainability (includ-
                ing noncareer officers) cannot simply decline a PCS, an event, and/or the associated
                ADSC, and take no other action. Officers who do not sign and submit an application
                requesting to establish a separation or retirement date within the prescribed timeframe
                according to paragraph 2.37. are considered to have accepted the PCS or event and the
                associated ADSC. An officer who receives an approved DOS or retirement date under
                7-day option provisions may be directed to PCS or participate in any event for which they
                have the minimum retainability, or if the minimum retainability is waived, or
                2.29.5.1.2.2. Have an established DOS or retirement date which is greater than the retain-
                ability required, then they may, if eligible, request an earlier separation date or retirement
                date. A request for earlier separation or retirement must be submitted within 7 days of offi-
                cial notification of a PCS or event. MPFs will submit a reclama to the assignment OPR or
                event selection authority when a member requests an earlier separation or retirement date.
                Officers who are ineligible for earlier separation or retirement may be unable to avoid pro-
                ceeding on PCS or participating in the event. When an officer with an established DOS or
                retirement date is required to make a PCS or participate in an event which has an ADSC,
                then the ADSC will update to the officer’s records, but he or she will not be made to serve
                any ADSC which extends beyond their established DOS or approved retirement date.
                These officers would separate or retire on the established DOS or approved retirement date
                with a portion of an ADSC unserved.
        2.29.5.2. When officers do not have retainability and:
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                      57


         2.29.5.2.1. Accept the PCS, event, and/or ADSC but have an established voluntary DOS or
         voluntary retirement date (not a mandatory or involuntary DOS or retirement date) and do not
         have the minimum retainability, the MPF will assist the officer in determining if they are eligi-
         ble to request withdrawal of their DOS according to AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned
         Officers, or eligible to request withdrawal of their retirement according to AFI 36-3203, Ser-
         vice Retirements. Officers who have a DOS which is the result of expiration of a SPTC may
         be eligible to execute an SPTC in accordance with AFI 36-2107. An officer is not permitted to
         execute an SPTC if they have an involuntary or mandatory DOS. An officer who had an indef-
         inite DOS and then established a voluntary DOS or retirement date cannot elect to execute an
         SPTC. These officers must request withdrawal of their DOS or retirement date and, if
         approved, withdrawal reverts the officer back to having an indefinite DOS. When officers are
         not eligible to withdraw their DOS or retirement date or execute an SPTC, then the MPF will
         reclama the assignment selection.
         2.29.5.2.2. Want to decline the PCS, event, and/or associated ADSC. When officers (career
         or noncareer) have an established DOS or retirement date and do not have the minimum
         required retainability for PCS or event, and/or do not want the associated ADSC (declines
         ADSC on AF Form 63), they may refuse to obtain additional retainability (without prejudice)
         and the MPF will reclama the selection. When an officer with an established DOS or retire-
         ment date is required to make a PCS or participate in an event which has an ADSC, then the
         ADSC will update to the officer’s records, but he or she will not be made to serve any ADSC
         which extends beyond their established DOS or approved retirement date. These officers
         would separate or retire on the established DOS or approved retirement date with a portion of
         an ADSC unserved.
  2.29.6. Airmen. There are a number of actions prescribed by this instruction which have a retainabil-
  ity requirement. Within the timeframe established for a particular action, the MPF will determine if
  airmen do or do not have the prescribed retainability; whether or not airmen want to accept the action;
  their eligibility to obtain additional retainability or decline to obtain retainability; what actions airmen
  must take in connection with acceptance or declination; schedule airmen for completion of those
  actions; and follow-up to ensure completion. Airmen who are eligible and desire to reenlist on their
  expiration of term of service (ETS) must not be en route PCS. Airmen who want to accept a PCS but
  want to delay obtaining PCS retainability are processed according to paragraph 2.29.6.8. Delay in
  obtaining retainability other than for PCS may be requested as an exception per paragraph 1.5.
     2.29.6.1. Airmen (including FTA) who have retainability cannot refuse a PCS or other action,
     except:
         2.29.6.1.1. Airmen eligible to request retirement under 7-day option provisions (see para-
         graph 2.37.). Airmen who request and receive an approved retirement date under 7-day option
         provisions may still be required to make a PCS, perform TDY, or participate in some other
         action depending on the amount of retainability they have remaining up to their actual retire-
         ment date, or
         2.29.6.1.2. When provisions exist to allow an airman who has retainability to refuse a specific
         action. For example, an airman requests a voluntary extension of OS tour and has the retain-
         ability to serve it, but after approval requests the extension be canceled.
58                                                 AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     2.29.6.2. For airmen who do not have retainability and want to obtain it, the MPF will deter-
     mine if they are eligible and assist them with reenlistment or extension of enlistment according to
     AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force. Retainability must be obtained within
     the time prescribed for the action. When airmen are temporarily ineligible or are eligible but want
     to delay obtaining retainability, the MPF will determine if the member meets any of the delay con-
     ditions outlined in paragraph 2.29.6.8. and Table 2.7. When airmen need additional retainability,
     but are ineligible to obtain it and/or when they do not meet the criteria for approval of a delay, then
     the MPF will reclama the selection.
     2.29.6.3. For airmen who do not have the retainability and do not want to obtain it, the MPF
     will take action for career airmen required by paragraph 2.29.6.3.1. and paragraph 2.29.6.6., if
     applicable. For FTA, the MPF will take action required by paragraph 2.29.6.3.2.
        2.29.6.3.1. Career Airmen. When career airmen need additional retainability and refuse to
        obtain it, the MPF will formally record their declination as outlined in this paragraph, unless
        they are eligible and desire to request retirement as shown in paragraph 2.37. When career air-
        men assigned in the CONUS (only) have 19 or more years total active federal military service
        (TAFMS) and are eligible to request retirement, but instead choose to decline to obtain retain-
        ability, see paragraph 2.29.6.6. Airmen who decline to obtain retainability are required to read
        the portions of AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force and AFI 36-2502,
        Airman Promotion Program. pertaining to ineligibility for reenlistment or extension of enlist-
        ment and promotion ineligibility, and sign an AF Form 964, PCS, TDY, or Training Declina-
        tion Statement, within 7 calendar days of being notified of the need for retainability (for PCS,
        also see paragraph 2.32., PCS Notification). The AF Form 964 is filed in the Unit Personnel
        Record Group (UPRG). If an airman will not sign the AF Form 964, the following statement
        will be entered on the AF Form 964 (front or reverse), signed by the person who counseled the
        airman, and filed in the UPRG: “(Grade, name, SSN of member), has refused to sign this doc-
        ument confirming his or her decision to decline to obtain retainability and acknowledging he
        or she is ineligible for promotion and ineligible to extend his or her enlistment or reenlist for a
        period of 93 calendar days after separation.” The MPF updates AAC 09, except when retain-
        ability was required for a Controlled Duty Assignment (CDA), then update AAC 08. See
        paragraph 2.29.6.7. to request withdrawal of retainability declination. Career airmen who
        are ineligible to obtain retainability because of High Year of Tenure (HYT) restriction
        (see AFI 36-3203) will not be required to complete an AF Form 964 and will not be coded
        as having declined to obtain retainability. When PCS is a mandatory move, see paragraph
        2.29.6.5.
        2.29.6.3.2. FTA. FTA who decline to obtain retainability are required to sign an AF Form 964
        (except Section II, paragraph b does not apply to FTA, and Section III, Career Motivation
        counseling is not required). If an airman will not sign the AF Form 964, the following state-
        ment will be entered on the AF Form 964 (front or reverse), signed by the person who coun-
        seled the airman, and filed in the UPRG: “(Grade, name, SSN of member), has refused to sign
        this document confirming his or her decision to decline to obtain retainability.” The MPF
        updates ALC L or 8, as appropriate. See paragraph 2.29.6.7. for limitations on withdrawal of
        declination statement. When PCS is a mandatory move, see paragraph 2.29.6.5.
     2.29.6.4. The following events require retainability and prescribe action to be taken. For PCS
     retainability and certain in-place actions, the MPF will refer to Table 2.5. and/or Table 2.6.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  59


     Remember, do not require airmen who are restricted from obtaining minimum retainability due to
     High Year of Tenure (HYT) (see AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements) to formally decline to obtain
     retainability.
        2.29.6.4.1. PCS CONUS to CONUS. The MPF will conduct a retainability interview and
        require airmen to obtain retainability no later than 30 calendar days after official PCS notifica-
        tion. The 30 calendar day suspense is intended to give the MPF flexibility in scheduling the
        retainability interview, not to allow members 30 days to decide if they want to obtain retain-
        ability or not. See paragraph 2.29.6.8. for airmen who desire to delay obtaining retainability.
        Process airmen who decline to obtain retainability in accordance with paragraph 2.29.6.3.
        2.29.6.4.2. PCS CONUS to OS. The MPF will conduct a retainability interview and require
        airmen to obtain retainability no later than 30 calendar days after official PCS notification.
        See paragraph 2.29.6.8. for airmen who desire to delay obtaining retainability. When PCS is
        OS (either from the CONUS or from OS), airmen must have or obtain the retainability for at
        least the unaccompanied tour length within 30 calendar days of PCS notification. Having
        accepted the PCS and obtained retainability for the unaccompanied tour length, then airmen
        who subsequently elect and are approved to serve an accompanied tour, may require additional
        retainability for the longer accompanied tour length. Do not allow airmen to delay obtaining
        retainability for the unaccompanied tour while awaiting processing for an accompanied tour.
        Airmen have 15 calendar days after concurrent travel approval to obtain retainability for the
        accompanied tour length or to formally decline. See paragraph 2.29.6.8. for airmen who
        desire to delay obtaining retainability for the accompanied tour length.
        2.29.6.4.3. PCS OS to CONUS. Airmen must have retainability required by Table 2.5. before
        they will be provided an assignment from the OS area. Airmen must have or obtain retainabil-
        ity (including airmen who must reenlist or extend) or complete their declination within 30
        days of making their OS returnee election (unless a delay is requested and approved to allow
        for voluntary retirement application (not 7 day option), or reenlistment in an SRB AFSC
        according to Table 2.7., rules 1 and 7) (see paragraph 2.29.6.8.). Airmen who do not have the
        retainability required for an assignment will be involuntarily extended at their OS location
        until their DOS as shown in paragraph 3.10.1. and Table 3.12. Airmen eligible to obtain
        retainability will not receive an assignment under the retainability exception provisions in
        Table 2.5. until declination action has been completed. For airmen who decline to obtain
        retainability follow the procedures in paragraph 2.29.6.3. Career airmen ineligible to obtain
        retainability because of HYT restrictions (see AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements) will not be
        required to complete AF Form 964 and will not be placed in AAC 09, but will be provided an
        assignment when they have retainability as outlined in Table 2.5.
        2.29.6.4.4. PCS OS to OS (Consecutive OS Tour [COT]). Airmen must have or obtain at least
        12 months retainability within 30 calendar days of the date they sign their DEROS Option RIP
        to receive COT consideration. Delay in obtaining this 12 months retainability will not be
        granted. Upon selection for a COT, airmen must have or obtain the retainability for at least the
        unaccompanied tour length within 30 calendar days of PCS notification unless a delay is
        requested and approved according to paragraph 2.29.6.8. and Table 2.7. Having accepted the
        PCS and obtained retainability for at least the unaccompanied tour length, airmen who elect
        and are approved to serve an accompanied tour, may require additional retainability for the
        longer accompanied OS tour length. Airmen have 15 calendar days after concurrent travel
60                                                AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


        approval to obtain retainability to serve the accompanied tour length, or formally decline per
        paragraph 2.29.6.3. (and serve the unaccompanied tour length).
        2.29.6.4.5. In-Place COT (IPCOT). Airmen must have or obtain at least 12 months retainabil-
        ity within 30 calendar days of the date they sign their DEROS Option RIP to receive IPCOT
        consideration. Delay in obtaining this 12 months retainability for IPCOT consideration will
        not be granted. Upon notification of approval of an IPCOT, airmen must have or obtain the
        retainability for at least the unaccompanied tour length within 30 calendar days unless a delay
        is requested and approved according to paragraph 2.29.6.8. and Table 2.7. Airmen who are
        currently serving an unaccompanied tour who elect to serve an accompanied IPCOT may
        require additional retainability for the longer accompanied OS tour length. Airmen have 15
        calendar days after approval of an accompanied tour to obtain retainability to serve the accom-
        panied tour length. Airmen who receive an approved IPCOT who refuse to obtain retainability
        are not required to formally decline. When airmen refuse to obtain retainability, the MPF will
        request the assignment OPR cancel the IPCOT.
        2.29.6.4.6. OS Tour Extension. Airmen must obtain retainability required for voluntary
        extension of an OS tour within 30 calendar days after being advised of approval of their exten-
        sion request. Do not require airmen who refuse to obtain retainability to formally decline.
        When airmen refuse to obtain retainability, the MPF will request the assignment OPR cancel
        the OS tour extension.
            2.29.6.4.6.1. Indefinite DEROS. Airmen must maintain at least 8 months service retain-
            ability in order to keep an indefinite DEROS. Airmen who fail to maintain at least 8
            months service retainability will have a DEROS established which equals their DOS.
        2.29.6.4.7. Other Actions. For other actions which may require retainability (e.g., TDY, train-
        ing, airmen erroneously assigned with less than the minimum retainability, change in OS tour
        length, etc.), the paragraph, attachment, or instruction which describes the action or program
        will indicate the timeframe within which retainability must be obtained and specify action to
        be taken in the event a member refuses. Airmen who refuse to obtain the full prescribed
        retainability for an action may, in many instances, be directed to complete the action with the
        amount of retainability they have. EXAMPLE: A member is selected for TDY of 179 days in
        length, but only has 120 days retainability and declines to obtain additional retainability. After
        the member has formally declined to obtain the additional retainability, they can be directed to
        perform TDY with the amount of retainability they do have.
     2.29.6.5. Involuntary Separation of Airmen Who Lack PCS Retainability. Airmen in a mandatory
     move PCS status (such as due to a force structure drawdown) are subject to separation in lieu of
     PCS when the member is ineligible or refuses to obtain the prescribed amount of PCS retainability
     and the member currently possesses less than 12 months service retainability (computed from
     RNLTD to current DOS). Under the provisions of AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Air-
     men, commanders may establish an earlier separation date (by memorandum to the MPF) when
     the member can no longer be used effectively based on the mission drawdown.
     2.29.6.6. Retainability Declination, Airmen With 19 Years TAFMS or More. When
     CONUS-assigned airmen (only) have 19 years or more TAFMS as of the month and year of PCS
     notification, and lack the minimum required PCS retainability and decline to obtain it, then the AF
     will establish an involuntary DOS for them as shown below. Withdrawal of declinations will not
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                61


     be considered after an involuntary DOS has been established. This process does not apply when
     airmen have less than 19 years TAFMS as of PCS notification month and year (see paragraph
     2.29.6.3.1.). This provision is not intended to deny airmen retirement. It does not apply to airmen
     with less than 19 years TAFMS as of the month and year of PCS notification. The intent is to pre-
     clude airmen who were eligible to elect retirement in lieu of PCS, but who declined instead to
     obtain PCS retainability, from remaining on active duty for a prolonged period of time waiting to
     retire upon their normal DOS. (NOTE: An involuntary DOS established under this provision is
     not an approved retirement date. Airmen who get an involuntary DOS this way must still apply
     for and receive approval to retire. Failure to request retirement may result in separation upon DOS
     without benefit of retirement.) An involuntary DOS is not established when declination of retain-
     ability is other than for PCS, such as TDY, training, or some other reason. Airmen will have an
     involuntary DOS established which is either the last day of the 6th month following PCS notifica-
     tion, or the latest date among the following:
        2.29.6.6.1. The last day of the month in which member completes 20 years’ TAFMS (but not
        less than 6 months from PCS notification).
        2.29.6.6.2. The last day of the month in which an ADSC expires.
        2.29.6.6.3. When assigned to a CONUS maximum tour, the last day of the month of the DOA.
        2.29.6.6.4. When airmen are surplus due to base closure, unit deactivation, AFSC overage, or
        similar circumstances, the DOS is the last day of the month airmen can be effectively used at
        their current station. The assignment OPR determines this date considering such factors as
        whether or not the member is filling a valid manpower authorization, etc.
        2.29.6.6.5. When airmen meet the criteria outlined above, the MPF will record declination as
        required in paragraph 2.29.6.3.1. and update the PDS with AAC 09. Reclama the assignment
        using reclama reason code “09” and in the trailer remarks indicate airman has 19 or more
        years’ TAFMS. It is important not to use any other reclama code reason. When reclama is by
        message, the message subject should be PCS retainability declination for airman with 19 or
        more years’ TAFMS. Address the message to the assignment OPR with an information copy
        to HQ AFPC/DPAAS3 for SMSgt and below. For CMSgts (including selects), address the rec-
        lama message to HQ AFPC/DPAC. HQ AFPC/DPAC or DPAAS3 will determine the DOS
        and advise the MPF by message to update the involuntary DOS. The MPF will update the
        DOS locally and cite SPEC-PROG ID “72.”
     2.29.6.7. Airmen Requests to Withdraw Retainability Declination Statement.
        2.29.6.7.1. Career Airmen. Declinations by career airmen described in paragraph 2.29.6.6.
        (more than 19 years TAFMS) may not be withdrawn. For other career airmen, the servicing
        MPF will send requests, which must include the unit commander’s recommendation, to the
        assignment OPR (Table 1.1.) with an information copy to the member’s parent MAJCOM/
        DPAA (or equivalent). Approval of withdrawal is based on manning in the airman’s AFSC.
        Requests for withdrawal submitted in conjunction with retraining are processed according to
        AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program.
        2.29.6.7.2. FTA. Declinations by FTA may not be withdrawn and declination renders them
        ineligible to apply for any self-initiated PCS action. However, FTA may reenlist without
        obtaining approval to withdraw their declination statement. After reenlistment, the record of
        previous declination by FTA is deleted.
62                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


        2.29.6.8. Airmen Retainability Delays. The MPF Commander may authorize an extension of the
        suspense date by which airmen must have additional retainability for the reasons shown in Table
        2.7., Airman PCS Retainability Suspense Delay. Pay particular attention to the notes to Table 2.7.
        as they contain additional special instructions and limitations for each category of delay. Delay in
        obtaining retainability is intended as a tool to accommodate airmen who have accepted an assign-
        ment (within certain limits). Approval of delays must be judiciously applied since they can have
        a negative impact on a gaining unit if the individual granted a delay later declines to obtain retain-
        ability. Delays must not expose the government to the risk of PCS entitlements being used for
        which airmen do not have sufficient retainability. Delay is not authorized for the purpose of
        allowing airmen more time to consider accepting a PCS. Delay for any other reason or period of
        time requires approval of an exception to policy per paragraph 1.5. The MPF Commander may
        delegate authority to approve authorized delays to a section chief. Any delay must be approved
        within the original retainability suspense period established for a particular kind of PCS or action.
        A delay of the retainability suspense is not a waiver to the amount (length) of retainability
        required. MPFs must take the following action for any approved delays:
            2.29.6.8.1. By the 7th calendar day of each month, MPFs will advise HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 by
            message, CRT, or email of delays approved for the previous month. No report is required if
            no delays were granted. Categorize delays by reason (that is, SRB delays, QC delays, etc.)
            and, for each member, provide the grade, name, SSN, PDD/DEROS, RNLTD, the date and
            length of time member extended enlistment (if applicable), and expiration date of delay.
            Include point of contact (POC) grade, name, DSN, and grade, name, and DSN of official
            approving delays.
            2.29.6.8.2. HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 will review the monthly reports and authorize suppression of
            the “P06” retainability purge.

2.30. Assignment Selection Date (ASD). The ASD is used in several ways. It may be the date an officer
or airman is selected by name for assignment by the assignment OPR, OR it may be the date the assign-
ment process begins in order to reassign an officer or airman on a scheduled future date (such as upon
DEROS, tour completion date from a CONUS maximum stabilized tour, the date a member will become
surplus, and so on), OR it may be the date when an officer (only) is identified by the assignment OPR as
vulnerable for PCS selection. Table 2.8. Determining Assignment Selection Date, shows the reasons and
specific dates when an ASD is established. When a member gets an automatic ASD based on a schedule
or an officer (only) gets an ASD based upon vulnerability for PCS selection, that is the member's official
ASD. For officers, an automatic ASD will be superceded by a vulnerability ASD. The PDS transaction
or message providing a member an end assignment may cite a different date as the ASD. When this hap-
pens, the date shown as the ASD in the message or transaction may be either the date the member was
matched to the assignment, or it may be the date the transaction was updated; but it is not the official
ASD. When the assignment OPR approves a change of DEROS, change of date of availability, etc., and
an ASD was established, the assignment OPR must review and manually change or cancel the ASD, as
appropriate.
     2.30.1. Following is a general example of how an automatic ASD works. For this example, we'll use
     an airman assigned OS; however, the concept is similar for officers. Approximately 9 months in
     advance, airmen with a date eligible for return from OS (DEROS) in a given month are identified. An
     ASD is automatically established based on the DEROS (month and year). In this case, establishment
     of an ASD does not mean the airman has been selected for a specific assignment. What it means is,
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                63


  reassignment of an individual will occur based on a firm future date and the ASD is the date the
  assignment process (or assignment "cycle") begins. Once the cycle begins, members must be limited
  in the actions they are allowed to take (such as, extension or curtailment of DEROS, change of
  CONUS maximum tour completion date, etc.) similar to members actually selected for PCS. Next,
  name selections are made to replace members on their DEROS (or maximum tour completion date,
  and so on). These selections are from members assigned in the CONUS or OS (for consecutive OS
  assignments). Then, the projected vacancies created by these name selections are prioritized (along
  with other existing vacancies) and OS returnees are then matched to fill all or a percentage of the
  vacancies. In this example, the "cycle" is complete when the OS returnee is matched to a specific
  assignment location; however, as you can see, it starts with the ASD. Remember, for officers, an auto-
  matic ASD (generated by DEROS or tour completion) will be superceded by a vulnerability ASD.
  2.30.2. On or after establishment of an ASD, members may not request an assignment, deferment
  from reassignment, separation, retirement, or other action which would render them ineligible for
  assignment, except as follows:
     2.30.2.1. Officers. Request for retirement or separation under 7-day option provisions, see para-
     graph 2.37., Seven Day Option.
     2.30.2.2. Airmen. Request for retirement under 7-day option provisions, see paragraph 2.37.,
     Seven Day Option.
     2.30.2.3. Request for reassignment or deferment under humanitarian provisions or the EFMP as
     authorized in Attachment 7.
     2.30.2.4. Request for separation for convenience of the government or hardship (see AFI 36-3207
     for officers and AFI 36-3208 for airmen).
     2.30.2.5. Request for deferment from reassignment based upon pregnancy as authorized in para-
     graph 2.39.
     2.30.2.6. Request submitted under sole surviving son or daughter provisions as authorized in
     Attachment 11.
     2.30.2.7. Hostile fire or imminent danger area deferment for family members as authorized in
     Attachment 6.
     2.30.2.8. Release from assignment to a family member’s unit as authorized in Attachment 6, or
     as an aircrew member as authorized in Attachment 9.
     2.30.2.9. Request for separation based on conscientious objector status per AFI 36-3204.
     2.30.2.10. Request from a commander for operational deferment as authorized in paragraph
     2.15.4.
     2.30.2.11. Request for release from assignment as a Medal of Honor recipient or candidate as
     authorized in paragraph 3.12.
     2.30.2.12. Request for change of assignment or cancellation based upon equal assignment oppor-
     tunity provisions as outlined in paragraph 2.2.
     2.30.2.13. Request to be released from voluntary OS PCS selection per paragraph 2.12.
64                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


2.31. Assignment Preferences. For military couples, also see Attachment 8.
     2.31.1. Officers:
        2.31.1.1. Colonels (including selects) make their personal assignment preferences known prima-
        rily through their senior rater and chain of command. Officers should ask their senior rater for
        advice on their next assignment and consider that advice carefully. Officers may also call the
        Colonel Matters Office, Assignments, and/or MAJCOM (or equivalent) senior officer manager to
        express their assignment preferences. While an officer's preferences will be considered, there is
        no guarantee the next assignment or location will be to a preference--ultimately the next assign-
        ment will be determined by the needs of the AF.
        2.31.1.2. Lieutenant colonels and below (excluding judge advocate officers) make their personal
        assignment preferences known through the use of the AF Form 4057, Officer Assignment Pref-
        erence Worksheet, which is available either electronically on the worldwide web, or, when the
        electronic version is not accessible, as a hard copy form. The officer’s commander also uses this
        worksheet to make recommendations for the officer’s next assignment. Commander involvement
        is required in the process as the preference worksheet will not be accepted by the assignment OPR
        without it. Attachment 17 provides essential information to enable officers to understand and
        participate in the AF Assignment System (AFAS).
     2.31.2. Airmen.
        2.31.2.1. CMSgts (including selects) volunteer for assignments advertised on EQUAL-Plus (see
        Attachment 16) by notifying their assignment NCO at the Chiefs' Group. Notification can be via
        telephone, e-mail, datafax, or electronic message.
        2.31.2.2. SMSgt and below use AF Form 392, Airman Assignment Preference Statement, to
        record CONUS or OS assignment preferences. To enhance the chance for selection to a desired
        location, the EQUAL should also be used (see Attachment 16). Airmen desiring to update their
        preferences should visit their CSS or MPF to update their preferences via PC-III terminal. Upon
        completion of the update, an AF Form 392 (computer generated copy) is produced and given to
        the airman for his or her records.
            2.31.2.2.1. Airmen volunteer for special duty assignments (SDAs) either via PC-III or
            through the worldwide web by update of the SDA job number from the EQUAL-Plus ad (see
            Attachment 16). In either case, airmen are limited in volunteering for only those SDAs which
            appear as ads on EQUAL-Plus. In addition to this electronic application some SDAs also
            require a hard copy application. The requirement for a hard copy application will be reflected
            in the EQUAL-Plus ad. When using PC-III to volunteer, the airman will receive a com-
            puter-generated Report of Individual Personnel (RIP) identifying the special duty applied for,
            and the “form” is sent electronically through the PDS to the assignment OPR.
            2.31.2.2.2. Each airman is individually responsible for the currency and accuracy of his or her
            assignment preferences. When a change in status occurs, for example, marriage, completion
            of a PCS, and so on, airmen should update their preferences accordingly. Outdated prefer-
            ences or no preferences on file will not be the basis for release of an airman from an assign-
            ment for which selected.

2.32. PCS Notification. The AF needs to know as quickly as possible after selection if members have
accepted a PCS or exercised another option. The prescribed means to transmit notices of assignment
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                   65


selection from the assignment OPR to the MPF is either by the PDS or electrical message via the servicing
military communications center. Other means such as CRT grams, e-mail, etc., are not acceptable (unless,
as an exception, the assignment OPR determines this means was essential in the interest of time or for
other reasons). When initial PCS selection, change in assignment location, or change in RNLTD is
received with less than 90 calendar days until the RNLTD, the MPF and unit notification periods indicated
below are reduced to 3 calendar days each. When a member is absent from station, the additional proce-
dures shown in paragraph 2.32.9. apply.
   2.32.1. MPFs, unit commanders, and unit officials authorized to effect notifications must ensure local
   procedures are established and followed so notifications are in strict accordance with this instruction.
   Commanders are responsible for determining which unit officials are authorized to effect notification.
   Members may be told or become aware they have been selected for PCS in a variety of ways. How-
   ever, "official" PCS notification takes place when the member's unit commander or authorized official
   notifies the member, in writing, of PCS selection and the member acknowledges notification, in writ-
   ing. NOTE: If a member is notified by a person the commander has not authorized to effect notifica-
   tions, the member's written acknowledgment and election are still valid.
   2.32.2. When notified of selection for an event, sometimes members want to request a humanitarian
   assignment or deferment, or want to submit some other action for consideration. They may also want
   to wait to make a binding decision on the event until they receive a decision on their humanitarian or
   other request. Such delays are not authorized. If a member is willing to be bound by the AF's deci-
   sion of approval or disapproval after due process of any request they submit, then advise the member
   to accept the event and associated ADSC within 7 calendar days and proceed with submission of the
   request. If the request is approved, the assignment will be changed or canceled as appropriate. How-
   ever, when members do not desire to accept an event or ADSC in the event a request they submit is
   disapproved, they should be advised to make a binding decision when initially notified because they
   will not be given another opportunity under 7-day option provisions when advised of disapproval.
   The eventual cancellation of a PCS requirement will not be the basis for allowing a member to with-
   draw an action taken under 7-day option provisions or (airmen only) removal of a formal retainability
   declination statement, provided the requirement was valid at the time the member was notified of
   selection.
   2.32.3. The 7 calendar day count begins the day after the date a member is officially notified and
   ends at the close of MPF business hours on the seventh calendar day following official notification. If
   the seventh calendar day is a weekend or holiday, then the official notification period is extended to
   the first duty day thereafter. The MPF and the unit suspenses are computed similarly. EXAMPLE: A
   member acknowledges notification by the unit commander at 0930 hours, 15 Aug 98, has until the
   close of MPF business on 22 Aug 98 (7 full calendar days), to accept the assignment or take some
   other authorized action.
   2.32.4. After acknowledging notification in writing, within the 7 calendar day period thereafter,
   members must take one of the following actions, or report to the MPF within the same 7 calendar day
   period to request counseling or assistance:
       2.32.4.1. Officers and Airmen. When members have the required retainability (see paragraph
       2.29.) and accept the assignment and/or ADSC, they must sign and date the notification showing
       their acceptance and return the notification to the MPF.
66                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


        2.32.4.2. Officers only. Officers who have the required retainability (see paragraph 2.29.) but
        who do not want to participate in the event and/or do not want the associated ADSC, must report
        in person to the MPF within 7 calendar days of notification and must sign AF Form 63 for decli-
        nation of ADSC and submit an application for separation or retirement, if eligible, under 7-day
        option provisions as required in paragraph 2.37.
        2.32.4.3. Airmen only. Airmen who have the required retainability (see paragraph 2.29.) but want
        to retire in lieu of the PCS and/or ADSC, must report in person to the MPF within 7 calendar days
        of notification and must sign and submit an application for retirement, if eligible, under 7-day
        option provisions as required in paragraph 2.37. Airmen who have the required retainability are
        not eligible under 7-day option provisions to request separation in lieu of PCS.
        2.32.4.4. Airmen only. Airmen who do not have the required retainability and who do not want
        the assignment and/or ADSC, must report in person to the MPF within 7 calendar days of notifi-
        cation and must sign a formal retainability declination statement when required by paragraph
        2.29.
        2.32.4.5. Airmen only. Airmen who do not have the required retainability (see paragraph 2.29.)
        and who accept the assignment and/or ADSC and want to obtain retainability must sign and return
        the notification in person to the MPF within 7 calendar days. The MPF will schedule airmen to
        obtain retainability at the earliest possible date, but not later than 30 calendar days after the date
        airmen acknowledged selection. If an airman fails to obtain the required retainability within 30
        days of notification, the MPF will reclama the assignment and have the airman sign AF Form 964.
        If the airman refuses to sign AF Form 964, then the MPF will take action according to paragraph
        2.29.6. The MPF will not execute the AF Form 964 without the member's knowledge.
     2.32.5. When the assignment selection notice is via the PDS, the MPF reviews the PCS Notification
     Report on Individual Personnel (RIP) within 7 calendar days of receipt, confirms member's eligibility,
     and forwards the PCS Notification RIP either electronically or via distribution to the member's unit.
     The Unit Commander or authorized official must then notify the member within 7 calendar days of
     receipt of the notice from the MPF. When the MPF identifies a PCS ineligibility condition and there
     is no indication a waiver or exception has been granted, the MPF will reclama the selection per para-
     graph 2.47. and will not forward the notice to the unit.
     2.32.6. When the assignment selection notice is by electrically transmitted message to the losing
     MPF (and for officers, when the message format shown in Figure 2.2. is not used such as when the
     RNLTD is more than 120 days in the future), then the MPF will confirm member's eligibility and
     request an overnight Assignment Loss RIP. Upon receipt of the RIP, the MPF will use the assignment
     information in the message and fill in the RIP and forward it within 7 calendar days to the losing unit.
     The unit must then notify the member within 7 calendar days of receipt of the notice from the MPF.
     As in paragraph 2.32.5. above, if the member is not eligible, the MPF will reclama the selection.
     2.32.7. (Officers Only). When the RNLTD is within 120 days, the assignment selection notice will be
     by electrically transmitted message and will be addressed directly to the losing unit. The message for-
     mat shown in Figure 2.2. will be used. The Unit Commander or authorized official must notify the
     member within 7 calendar days of receipt of the message. The MPF will review selection within 7
     calendar days of receipt, confirm member's eligibility, and suspense the message for receipt of mem-
     ber's acknowledgment. When the MPF identifies a PCS ineligibility condition and there is no indica-
     tion a waiver or exception has been granted, the MPF will contact the unit commander or
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                      67


  commander's support staff (CSS), and advise them that the MPF is required to submit a reclama per
  paragraph 2.47.
  2.32.8. The instrument to record official notification and acknowledgment may be either the PCS
  Notification RIP, the message format shown in Figure 2.2., or a locally prepared letter. If a letter is
  used and more than one page is needed, continue on the reverse rather than using two single pages. A
  letter must contain at least the following information.
     2.32.8.1. The gaining location (unit, position number, and duty title are optional);
     2.32.8.2. RNLTD;
     2.32.8.3. ADSC (for officers) and retainability required (for airmen), including ADSC/retainabil-
     ity for training, if applicable.
     2.32.8.4. If PCS is OS, the minimum required unaccompanied tour length (the accompanied tour
     length is optional);
     2.32.8.5. The CAFSC (for airmen) and SAFSC (for officers);
     2.32.8.6. The signature and date the unit commander or authorized official effected notification;
     2.32.8.7. The signature and date the member acknowledged notification (date member acknowl-
     edges notification must be the same as the date officially notified in paragraph 2.32.8.6. above);
     2.32.8.8. A statement directing the member to elect one of the two options below by initialing in
     the blank space (or block) in front of that option. After making an election, but not later than 7 cal-
     endar days from the date of official notification, direct the member to report to the MPF Reloca-
     tions Element. Include the guidance in paragraph 2.32.3.
         2.32.8.8.1. A statement that: I accept the PCS (and training, if applicable) and the associated
         ADSC.
         2.32.8.8.2. Statements indicating: I do not desire the PCS and/or training; and/or I do not
         desire to incur the associated ADSC; and/or I do not desire to obtain the required retainability.
         I understand within 7 calendar days of notification, if eligible, I must sign and submit a request
         to separate (officers only); or a request to retire (officers/airmen); or I must decline, in writing,
         to obtain additional retainability (airmen and only those officers who already have an estab-
         lished DOS). I also understand if within 7 calendar days of notification I am ineligible, or I
         fail to submit a request to separate (officers only) or retire (officers/airmen), or I do not
         decline, in writing, to obtain retainability (airmen only), then I will be considered to have
         accepted the PCS (and training, if applicable) and the associated ADSC.
         2.32.8.8.3. Optional statements may be added by the MPF; for example, asking if the member
         desires counseling on humanitarian assignment/deferment or any other circumstances. Be
         sure to advise the member that, even though they may desire additional counseling, they must
         still choose one of the above options within 7 calendar days after notification.
  2.32.9. When the unit commander or official authorized by the commander cannot notify the member
  due to the member's absence from the duty station (but the member will return within 10 calendar
  days), the unit will delay notification until the member's first duty day after return. If the member will
  be absent more than 10 calendar days, the unit will advise the MPF of the member's status and provide
  the details on the member’s whereabouts (address, contact phone number, etc.). The MPF will notify
68                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     the member, in writing, at his or her TDY location, leave address, etc., and assist the member with
     actions necessary to accept the assignment (for example, extension of enlistment), or exercise another
     option (request separation or retirement) as the circumstances and length of absence dictate. The fact
     a member is on leave or TDY must not delay the notification process. The member must make a deci-
     sion to accept the PCS or exercise an authorized alternative within the prescribed timeframe. MPFs
     may notify members via overnight mail or similar means with return receipt requested. If for some
     reason a member cannot be notified in writing and must be advised by telephone, a second MPF offi-
     cial should witness the call (conference call). A written record of what the member was told should
     be made and both officials should sign the document. Be sure the member understands the instruc-
     tions and provide a contact point in the MPF (grade, name, duty title, telephone number), and advise
     the member to call if he or she has any questions or requires additional assistance. Require the mem-
     ber to acknowledge the telephone conversation in writing within 48 hours of the call and send the
     acknowledgment to the MPF. When members are absent from station and are notified of PCS selec-
     tion, then use the date the member acknowledges receipt of notification by mail or use the date mem-
     ber is personally contacted by phone. See paragraph 2.30. for actions permitted after establishment of
     an ASD.

2.33. PCS Notification and Orders in Hand Minimums. To allow sufficient time to plan movement of
dependents, HHGs, and arrange other PCS-related actions, members are normally selected for PCS so
official notification can be effected at least 90 calendar days before the RNLTD. In addition, members
normally should have PCS orders in hand at least 60 calendar days before the PDD shown in the assign-
ment instructions. However, there are numerous exceptions listed in paragraph 2.33.1. when it is not
practical or necessary to adhere to the minimums or a member can anticipate he or she will be reassigned
at a certain time (even though they may not know where). There are also times when military require-
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                     71


ments dictate less than 90 calendar days notice and/or when orders cannot be given to the member within
60 calendar days of departure. When military requirements preclude meeting these goals, the assignment
OPR may waive the minimums and will indicate in the assignment instructions that the minimums are
waived. For PCS movement to or from OS, orders may be issued prior to receipt of flight reservations.
   2.33.1. The minimum notice and orders in hand minimums do not apply to the following (no waiver
   is required):
       2.33.1.1. Flying, technical training, or other school graduate or eliminee assignments.
       2.33.1.2. When the member is being reassigned from OS.
       2.33.1.3. Approved self-initiated assignments.
       2.33.1.4. First assignment after basic or initial skill training.
       2.33.1.5. Assignment to training or education when necessary to avoid a quota going unfilled.
       2.33.1.6. Assignments which require SCI access.
       2.33.1.7. Low-cost or permissive PCS.
       2.33.1.8. When the member voluntarily waives the minimums.
       2.33.1.9. When member is surplus.
       2.33.1.10. General officer or colonel (including selectee) assignments.
       2.33.1.11. Upon accession (officers) or enlistment (airmen) including assignment of former
       officer upon enlistment.
       2.33.1.12. When the PCS is for reasons other than prescribed by this instruction (such as upon
       accession or enlistment, to a hospital as a patient, prisoners to confinement, upon separation/retire-
       ment, and so on (see Attachment 22).
   2.33.2. Orders directing a member who is TDY or on leave to PCS will not normally be published
   before the member's return to current duty station, except:
       2.33.2.1. When the orders publishing function confirms the member will not incur a personal
       financial loss;
       2.33.2.2. The member's unit or base is being inactivated;
       2.33.2.3. For humanitarian or EFMP assignment and the member signs a statement that he or she
       is willing to accept a financial loss if prompt reassignment is elected.

2.34. Change in Assignment or Assignment Data. Once a member has accepted an assignment, the
assignment OPR must exercise caution in approving changes to the original assignment, especially any
change after a member has departed on PCS (if the member has departed, see paragraph 2.35., Diversion
of a Member En Route PCS). For example, a later RNLTD or change which adds training may require
additional retainability and/or greater ADSC, or a change in gaining OS location may involve a longer OS
tour length. Sometimes changes cannot be avoided. When a change is directed prior to a member's depar-
ture on PCS, MPFs and commanders will use the 3 calendar day notification period, the procedures in
paragraph 2.32., and the MPF will take the actions shown below:
72                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     2.34.1. Change in gaining location (only). Once PCS orders are issued, a change in the gaining loca-
     tion could create a hardship on the member or, if they were a volunteer, they may not want an assign-
     ment to a different location. When the projected gaining location is changed, the MPF will authorize
     the member a second 7-day option period (see paragraph 2.37.). This may result in members exercis-
     ing an authorized option for which the member was not eligible at the time of initial notification. For
     example, when originally selected a member may not have been eligible to retire in lieu of PCS, but
     since then they have become eligible. When notified of the change of gaining location, they may opt
     at that time to retire in lieu of the change.
     2.34.2. Assignment data (other than gaining location) is changed requiring additional retainability or
     increase in the length of ADSC. Normally, changes in assignment data such as change of gaining unit,
     requirement for a security clearance, or even changes requiring additional retainability (when the
     member already possesses the retainability or already has a greater ADSC), do not warrant a second
     7-day option opportunity. However, when the change requires additional retainability or increase in
     the length of ADSC, the MPF will afford the member a second 7-day option period (see paragraph
     2.37.) in which to accept or decline the change, if eligible. For example, airmen required to extend
     their enlistment or reenlist to satisfy the additional retainability requirement; or officers with a DOS
     who must execute a SPTC for additional retainability; or officers with an indefinite DOS who will
     incur a greater ADSC would require a second 7-day option period. This includes exercising any
     options the member was not eligible for at the time of initial notification.

2.35. Diversion of a Member En Route PCS. When a change of projected gaining location is required
and the member is en route PCS (and has not arrived at the original gaining location), change of assign-
ment at this time is a "diversion." (Also see paragraph 2.35.3. and 2.35.4. for continuation of PCS.) Use
of the term diversion should signal a high degree of urgency to all who are responsible for processing the
change. A diversion can impose a severe personal and/or financial hardship on the member, unfairly
place a member at a disadvantage, and result in excessive PCS costs to the government. Before directing
a diversion, the assignment OPR must carefully weigh the circumstances and alternatives. (See paragraph
4.17. for requests to place a member in a 'TDY Hold" status when a temporary situation dictates a member
not return to their previous permanent duty station, nor proceed to the original gaining location, and a
decision is pending regarding a new gaining permanent duty station.) A member who is diverted en route
is not afforded a 7-day option period to take action in lieu of PCS since they have already departed on
PCS. A diversion might be necessary due to announcement of inactivation or movement of a unit,
announcement of weapon system conversion, or unforeseen urgent and essential changes in manning
requirements.
     2.35.1. Gaining MAJCOMs (or equivalent) request diversions by message to the assignment OPR,
     with information to the original gaining MPF, the proposed gaining MPF, the losing MPF, and other
     addressees as appropriate. These requests are time-sensitive. MPFs should not act upon requests for
     diversions until the change is approved by the assignment OPR. As a minimum, requests should con-
     tain the following:
        2.35.1.1. A short summary of how the situation has changed since the original assignment was
        directed.
        2.35.1.2. Alternatives considered and why they are not acceptable.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  73


     2.35.1.3. Whether or not the member was contacted and, if known, member's volunteer status,
     present location, phone number where member can be reached, and any other pertinent informa-
     tion (location of dependents if different than member's location, status of HHGs, etc.).
  2.35.2. The assignment OPR will consider all of the information available. When assignment
  involves an OS location, the following general guidelines apply.
     2.35.2.1. Whenever possible, members selected for assignment OS as volunteers who are not vul-
     nerable for involuntary OS selection are diverted within the same country to a location with the
     same tour length.
     2.35.2.2. Members selected for assignment OS as nonvolunteers are diverted within the same OS
     theater and to a location with the same OS selection criteria (i.e., short tour, long tour), whenever
     possible.
     2.35.2.3. If dependents have been authorized concurrent travel, diversion of a member is rarely
     justified to a location where concurrent travel is not authorized.
     2.35.2.4. (Airmen only) OS short tour returnees will not be assigned to CONUS-Isolated stations
     unless no other personnel are available or mission accomplishment would be impaired. Short tour
     returnees selected involuntarily can request release from a CONUS-Isolated station assignment
     through the MPF and gaining MAJCOM/DPAA. HQ AFPC/DPAAD is final approval authority.
  2.35.3. Upon approval by the assignment OPR to change a member's assignment, the losing MPF is
  advised. If the member has departed on PCS, the losing MPF will normally contact the member en
  route and effect notification. After the member has been notified, the losing MPF will immediately
  amend the original PCS orders and send copies to the member, the original gaining location, and the
  new gaining location. When the losing MPF cannot contact the member en route, then before amend-
  ing orders, the losing MPF will immediately advise the assignment OPR, the original gaining MPF,
  the new MPF, and the gaining and losing MAJCOM(s) of the circumstances. The assignment OPR
  then must consider the probability that the member will arrive at the original PCS location before
  being advised of the change of assignment. In view of this, the assignment OPR will review the
  urgency of the requirement and other factors and may decide to cancel the change of assignment.
  However, if the circumstances still justify the change, the assignment OPR will contact the original
  gaining MPF and, provided the member has not yet arrived in the area, the assignment OPR will direct
  the original gaining MPF to issue amendments to PCS orders "continuing" the member's PCS.
  Include the following statement in the amended orders, "This is a continuation of original assignment
  from (fill in previous permanent duty station) and member may be entitled to an additional dislocation
  allowance (DLA) as authorized by the JFTR." With the assistance of the original gaining unit com-
  mander and sponsor, the member is immediately informed upon arrival in the area of the change of
  assignment, given copies of the orders directing continuation of PCS, and directed to proceed to the
  new location without delay. If the member states continuation change of PCS will create a personal or
  financial hardship or protests the change of assignment for other reasons, the MPF will obtain the
  details in a written statement from the member and immediately contact the assignment OPR and
  request guidance.
  2.35.4. If, after a member arrives in the local area of the gaining base, it is decided to request the
  member be assigned elsewhere (whether or not they have signed in), then a new PCS is required. The
  fact a member has not signed in simply means accountability for the member has not transferred to the
  gaining base. For assignment purposes, completion of the travel portion of the PCS before approval
74                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     of further assignment requires a new PCS. See paragraph 2.25. for time on station waivers and para-
     graph 2.52. for waiver of second dislocation allowance entitlement (DLA) in the same fiscal year
     (FY). Intent to move or not move dependents or not to claim DLA is not a factor. A PCS cannot be
     continued nor a PCS order amended to change the permanent duty station after the RNLTD. In either
     of these instances a new PCS is required.

2.36. PCS Cancellation. Once a member is selected for PCS and orders are published, cancellation of
the assignment could impose a hardship on the member. A PCS should not normally be canceled within
60 days of the PDD unless the member cannot be effectively used at the projected location. Cancellation
of a PCS may be authorized only by the assignment OPR. The following actions are taken upon receipt
of PCS cancellation:
     2.36.1. If a member has not departed on PCS, then the MPF advises the commander of the cancella-
     tion within 48 hours of receipt of the cancellation notice. If the member indicates a hardship will
     exist as a result of cancellation, then the MPF will direct the member to prepare a written statement
     without delay containing the details of the hardship. The statement should be expeditiously processed
     through the unit commander to the MPF. Upon receipt of the statement, the MPF will advise the
     assignment OPR by message with information to the gaining unit, and gaining and losing MAJCOMs
     (or equivalent). As a minimum, the message should contain the member's grade, name, SSN, SAFSC
     (for officers )/CAFSC (for airmen), AAN, RNLTD, gaining PAS, CONUS and OS assignment prefer-
     ences, and specifics of the hardship. The assignment OPR will consider reinstatement of original
     assignment, provide an alternate assignment, or confirm cancellation and provide the reasons member
     is required to remain at the present base.
     2.36.2. If a member has departed on PCS, within 48 hours of receipt of the cancellation notice, the
     MPF will inform the unit commander and the MPF will effect notification to the member at their leave
     or TDY address (see paragraph 2.32.), and direct the member to return to their previous duty station
     unless they desire to use leave. The MPF will request the member to provide written acknowledgment
     within 72 hours and state whether a hardship will or will not exist. If the member indicates a hardship,
     they must include the details. The MPF will then advise the assignment OPR by message as shown in
     paragraph 2.36.1. If the member cannot be reached, the MPF advises the assignment OPR of the cir-
     cumstances and additional guidance will be provided. As information, when a PCS is canceled while
     the member is en route, their date arrived station does not change and availability for reselection for
     assignment does not change.

2.37. Seven Day Option. The options extended to officers to request retirement or separation, or to air-
men to request retirement, in connection with selection for certain events are not the same. There are
some similarities and certain special provisions and restrictions apply to both. The areas which are simi-
lar are addressed below followed by separate paragraphs explaining the options for officers and those for
airmen.
     2.37.1. Special Provisions and Restrictions. There are a number of special provisions and restrictions
     which apply to the 7-day option. The following apply to both officers and airmen, unless indicated
     otherwise.
        2.37.1.1. When a signed request for separation or retirement is dated before an ASD for PCS or
        selection date for training, then normal separation and retirement criteria apply. When a signed
        request for separation or retirement is the same date or after an ASD for PCS or selection date for
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                       75


     training, then any request for separation (officers only) or retirement (officers and airmen) must be
     under 7-day option. The fact a member was not aware or had not been officially notified of selec-
     tion does not change the fact they had been selected on or before the date of their separation or
     retirement request. When a member's request for separation or retirement and selection for PCS or
     training occur at about the same time, use the previous rule to determine which action is officially
     first. When the member's request for voluntary separation or retirement was before selection for
     PCS or training and the member does not want the assignment or training, the MPF will submit a
     reclama per paragraph 2.47. for airmen and paragraph 2.37.2.4. for officers and advise the assign-
     ment OPR the member applied for separation or retirement prior to selection. However, if the
     member wants to accept the PCS or training, then they must submit a request to withdraw their
     separation or retirement request within 7 calendar days of official notification of selection for PCS
     or training. When a member's request for separation or retirement was submitted under normal
     voluntary provisions but they had an ASD prior to the date of their request, then if they still want
     to separate (officers only) or retire (officer or airmen), then the reason for their separation or retire-
     ment request must be changed to reflect it as being submitted under 7-day option provisions and
     7-day option rules apply in determining the separation or retirement date. If the member wants to
     change the reason for their separation or retirement request, the MPF will submit a reclama per
     paragraph 2.47. for airmen and message reclama/notification per paragraph 2.37.2.4. for officers
     and advise the assignment OPR and the appropriate separation or retirement office of the mem-
     ber’s desires. The assignment OPR will coordinate with the HQ AFPC separations or retirements
     section which will direct action necessary to change or resubmit the voluntary request under 7-day
     option provisions.
     2.37.1.2. When the instruction governing an education or training event contains a provision to
     allow members to decline attendance (with or without prejudice), then a member is not required to
     request separation or retirement under 7-day option provisions if they do not desire to participate
     in the event or incur the associated ADSC. If there are no provisions in the prescribing instruction
     allowing a member to decline (with or without prejudice), then 7-day option provisions apply.
     2.37.1.3. Members who elect separation or retirement remain eligible for any PCS, TDY, or train-
     ing for which they have sufficient retainability or when the retainability requirement is waived.
     Members directed to participate will be assigned the ADSC for the event, but will not be made to
     serve beyond their DOS or retirement date. In such cases, members separate or retire with a por-
     tion of the ADSC unserved. An ADSC will not involuntarily extend an established DOS or retire-
     ment date.
     2.37.1.4. Members applying for separation or retirement under 7-day option provisions may not
     request a separation or retirement date earlier than the minimum dates allowed for normal volun-
     tary separation or retirement requests. Similarly, if the AF seeks to establish a separation or retire-
     ment date earlier than the member requests, the date will not normally be earlier than the
     minimum authorized by separation or retirement instructions. Members selected for PCS, TDY,
     or training who have an established DOS or retirement date may request an earlier DOS or retire-
     ment date under 7-day option provisions, if eligible, but not earlier than the minimum authorized
     by separation or retirement instructions.
     2.37.1.5. Members who establish a separation or retirement date under 7-day option provisions
     who later decide they do not want to separate or retire may request withdrawal of the approved
     date through separation or retirement channels. The request will be routed by the AFPC separa-
76                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


        tion or retirement office to the assignment OPR for consideration. Requests for withdrawal are
        not automatically approved. The assignment OPR will make a recommendation of approval or
        disapproval based on manning and the overall best interests of the AF. See paragraph 2.37.1.10.2.
        for guidance on 7-day option subsequent to withdrawal.
        2.37.1.6. During the period of time between establishment of an ASD and notification of actual
        PCS selection, if a member desires to request separation or retirement, 7-day option provisions
        apply. Normally, notification of establishment of an ASD or notification of nomination for assign-
        ment does not require a member to request separation or retirement within 7 calendar days, unless
        the ASD or nomination notification states otherwise.
        2.37.1.7. Officers. Under 7-day option provisions, officers serving on an SPTC may not establish
        a separation date earlier than the expiration date of their contract, however, officers may establish
        an earlier retirement date, if eligible.
        2.37.1.8. Airmen. Under 7-day option provisions, airmen serving an enlistment contract may not
        establish a separation date earlier than the expiration date of their contract, however, airmen may
        establish an earlier retirement date, if eligible.
        2.37.1.9. Airmen. Airmen who elect retirement under 7-day option provisions are not eligible for
        promotion. Airmen selected for promotion before they submit a retirement application under
        7-day option may not withdraw the retirement to accept promotion.
        2.37.1.10. The 7-day option provisions do not apply in the following circumstances:
            2.37.1.10.1. The move is in conjunction with a member being accessed for entry on active
            duty or a member recalled to active duty.
            2.37.1.10.2. A member with a DOS or retirement date established per 7-day option provisions
            who then requests and receives approval to withdraw their 7-day option DOS or retirement
            date, is not authorized a 7-day option in connection with the first event following approval of
            withdrawal when selection is within 12 months of the date of approved withdrawal. When
            selection for the first event is more than 12 months following the date of approval of with-
            drawal, the member may exercise 7-day option provisions, if eligible.
            2.37.1.10.3. A member has departed on PCS whether or not they have arrived at the new duty
            station.
            2.37.1.10.4. The move is under authority of an instruction other than this one, for example,
            PCS in a patient status, prisoner status, for court martial, for administrative proceedings, etc.,
            (see Attachment 22).
            2.37.1.10.5. Members restored to active duty, or reinstated on active duty following action
            under the Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) process.
     2.37.2. Officers. Officers with an indefinite DOS selected for PCS, education, training, an
     ADSC-incurring event, or who have an ASD, who do not want to participate in the event and/or do not
     want the associated ADSC, if eligible as outlined below and in Table 2.9., must sign AF Form 63 to
     decline the ADSC and submit a request for separation in accordance with AFI 36-3207, Separating
     Commissioned Officers, or request for retirement in accordance with AFI 36-3203, Service Retire-
     ments. Even though a DOS or retirement date is requested or established under 7-day option
     provisions, officers may be directed to participate in the original event, or may be selected for
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  77


  another event for which they have retainability or when the retainability requirement is waived.
  The ADSC for an event will be updated to officers’ records if they participate, but in some cases, such
  as when a requested separation or retirement date is approved and officers are directed to participate
  in the event anyway, they would separate or retire on the approved date with a portion of the ADSC
  unserved. Officers’ separation or retirement requests must be signed and submitted within 7 calendar
  days of official PCS notification or event notification date. Officers notified of an ASD are not
  required to request separation or retirement within 7 calendar days of the event notification date; how-
  ever, the rest of the 7-day option provisions apply during the period between establishment of an ASD
  and up to 7 calendar days following official notification of selection for PCS. Officers who fail to
  submit a request to establish a DOS or retirement date within 7 calendar days are considered as having
  accepted the event and the associated ADSC. Officers who have an established DOS or retirement
  date at the time of official PCS notification or event notification, if eligible, may request an earlier
  DOS or retirement date. Officers who have an established DOS or retirement date based on expiration
  of an ADSC and their current DOS or retirement date is greater than the ADSC they would incur for
  the event for which selected, have no options under the 7-day option provisions. The following eligi-
  bility requirements shown in Table 2.9. are further explained below.
     2.37.2.1. Officers who have 19 or more years TAFMS as of the event notification date (month and
     year) or establishment of an ASD may apply for retirement and officers with less than 19 years
     TAFMS may apply for separation only.
     2.37.2.2. The date of separation or date of retirement officers are eligible to request under 7-day
     option provisions varies depending on their grade, whether serving OS or in the CONUS, if on a
     CONUS maximum stabilized tour, if they have been notified of establishment of an ASD based on
     vulnerability for involuntary PCS selection and whether or not they have an unserved ADSC on
     the requested separation or retirement date. Officers may not request a separation or retirement
     date which is before the expiration of an ADSC, except as an exception to policy in accordance
     with paragraph 1.5. Officers with no ADSC (and those with an ADSC which will expire before
     the requested date of separation or retirement) may request a separation or retirement date which
     is no later than the first day of the 12th month following their ASD (mo/yr) or event notification
     (mo/yr), except:
         2.37.2.2.1. Officers with an indefinite DOS selected for PCS, education, training, an
         ADSC-incurring event, and those who have an ASD who are assigned in the CONUS (and not
         on a maximum stabilized tour) who have an ADSC greater than 12 months from the event
         notification date or ASD, may request a separation date which is not later than the date they
         complete their longest ADSC, or for retirement, the first day of the month following the month
         in which they complete their longest ADSC.
         2.37.2.2.2. Officers assigned OS must request a separation date to coincide with their DEROS
         (month/year) or must request a retirement date which is not later than the first day of the month
         following DEROS, if otherwise eligible to separate per AFI 36-3207, or retire per AFI
         36-3203. Officers who want to separate or retire after present assignment but the date they
         desire is after their current DEROS, must request a voluntary extension of OS tour to satisfy
         the requirement to separate upon DEROS (month/year), or retire on the first day of the month
         following DEROS (as extended). This extension must be completed before establishment of
         an ASD as shown in Table 2.8. and paragraph 2.30. Once an ASD has been established, offic-
         ers who desire to separate or retire on a date other than authorized above must request an
78                                            AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     exception to policy per paragraph 1.5. Officers who have an ADSC beyond their DEROS
     must either request an extension of DEROS as outlined above so their ADSC is completed as
     of the requested separation or retirement date, or they may request an exception to policy.
     Approval of a DOS beyond current DEROS may result in involuntary extension of DEROS to
     match the established DOS if the officer lacks retainability to receive a CONUS assignment
     (see Table 2.5.). Officers are not required to request separation or retirement within 7 calendar
     days of being notified of an ASD; however, the rest of the 7-day option provisions apply dur-
     ing the period between establishment of an ASD and up to 7 calendar days following official
     notification of end assignment. Requests submitted more than 7 calendar days after official
     notification of end assignment must be submitted as an exception to policy per paragraph 1.5.
     Because officers must separate or retire in conjunction with their DEROS, officers who have
     an indefinite DEROS who want to separate or retire after present assignment must request a
     specific DEROS be established as outlined in paragraph 3.8.5. The request to establish a
     DEROS and the separation or retirement request should be submitted together when the
     requested DEROS results in an ASD being established.
     2.37.2.2.3. For officers serving on a CONUS maximum stabilized tour (AACs 46 and 50),
     officers cannot request a separation or retirement date earlier than the minimum authorized in
     separation and retirement instructions. For officers completing a CONUS maximum stabi-
     lized tour (AACs 46 and 50), an ASD is established as shown in paragraph 2.30. and Table
     2.8. Officers are not required to request separation or retirement within 7 calendar days of
     being notified of establishment an ASD; however, the rest of the 7-day option provisions apply
     during the period between establishment of an ASD and up to 7 calendar days following offi-
     cial notification of end assignment. After establishment of an ASD, officers are limited with
     regard to the latest separation or retirement date they may request. If otherwise eligible per
     AFI 36-3207, officers serving on a CONUS maximum stabilized tour may request a separation
     date not greater than their availability date (month/year), or, if otherwise eligible per AFI
     36-3203, they may request a retirement date which is not greater than the first day of the
     month following their availability date, unless they request an exception to policy. Officers
     who want to separate or retire after present assignment but the date they desire is after their
     DOA, must request a voluntary extension of stabilized tour to satisfy the requirement to sepa-
     rate upon DOA (month/year), or retire on the first day of the month following DOA (as
     extended). This extension must be completed before establishment of an ASD as shown in
     Table 2.8. and paragraph 2.30. Once an ASD has been established, officers who desire to sep-
     arate or retire on a date other than authorized above must request an exception to policy per
     paragraph 1.5. Officers who have an ADSC beyond their DOA must either request an exten-
     sion of DOA as outlined above so their ADSC is completed as of the requested separation or
     retirement date, or they may request an exception to policy. Prior to establishment of an ASD
     officers who desire to separate or retire may request separation according to AFI 36-3207, or
     retirement according to AFI 36-3203.
     2.37.2.2.4. For officers notified of establishment of an ASD based on vulnerability for PCS
     selection and who are currently assigned OS, see paragraph 2.37.2.2.2. above. For officers
     assigned in the CONUS who are currently serving on a CONUS maximum stabilized tour, see
     paragraph 2.37.2.2.3. above. For all other officers currently assigned in the CONUS, when
     notified of establishment of an ASD according to paragraph 2.30. and Table 2.8., based on
     vulnerability for involuntary PCS selection, the following applies. Officers are not required to
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                79


        request separation or retirement within 7 calendar days of being notified of an ASD; however,
        the rest of the 7-day option provisions apply during the period between establishment of an
        ASD and up to 7 calendar days following official notification of end assignment. After estab-
        lishment of an ASD, officers are limited with regard to the latest separation or retirement date
        they may request. The earliest date they may request varies depending on whether they are
        assigned OS, to a CONUS maximum tour or a CONUS assignment other than a maximum
        tour. Officers may not request a separation or retirement date which is before the expiration of
        an ADSC, except as an exception to policy in accordance with paragraph 1.5. Officers with no
        ADSC (and those with an ADSC which will expire before the requested date of separation or
        retirement) may request a separation or retirement date which is no later than the first day of
        the 12th month following event notification. Officers who have an ADSC greater than 12
        months from the ASD may request a separation date which is not later than the date they com-
        plete their longest ADSC, or for retirement, the first day of the month following the month in
        which they complete their longest ADSC. Once an ASD has been established, officers who
        desire to separate or retire on a date other than authorized above must request an exception to
        policy per paragraph 1.5. Prior to establishment of an ASD officers who desire to separate or
        retire may request separation according to AFI 36-3207, or retirement according to AFI
        36-3203.
     2.37.2.3. Officers are authorized an additional opportunity (second 7-day option period) in which
     to request separation or retirement, if eligible, when a change in assignment data results in a
     greater ADSC (greater meaning an ADSC of longer length than originally accepted), or whenever
     the end assignment changes before the officer departs on PCS. For example, if an officer origi-
     nally accepted a PCS ADSC of 24 months but then training is added increasing the length of the
     ADSC from 24 months to 30 months, this is a greater ADSC. In this example it is appropriate to
     afford the officer a second 7-day option period. Another example is an officer originally accepted
     an ADSC for PCS of 24 months but then the RNLTD is delayed by 3 months. Based on paragraph
     2.37.2.3.1. below, this officer would not be afforded an additional 7-day option opportunity
     because the 24 month ADSC for PCS was not greater than the original length of the ADSC. (It is
     true, however, that the 3 month delay of RNLTD would delay when the 24 month ADSC would
     start and when it would be completed.) In still another example, an officer accepted a CONUS to
     CONUS PCS to Randolph AFB and the associated ADSC for a PCS. Then the assignment was
     changed to Wash, D.C. (but the length of the PCS ADSC was the same). This officer would be
     afforded a second 7-day option because of the change of end location (even though the length of
     the PCS ADSC was the same).
        2.37.2.3.1. Normally, a second 7-day option period is not authorized when the event start date
        or RNLTD is delayed due to unforeseen circumstances and the length of the ADSC originally
        accepted (as explained above) is not greater (longer in length). However, such delays, in turn,
        can cause delay in the ADSC completion date. Therefore, when the start date or RNLTD is
        delayed 181 days or more, an officer may request a second 7-day option period as an exception
        to policy per paragraph 1.5. The decision whether or not to approve the second 7-day option
        request will be made on a case-by-case basis.
        2.37.2.3.2. A second 7-day option period is not authorized when a change of assignment data
        or change of end assignment is the result of approval of an officer's request for the change.
80                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


        2.37.2.4. When an officer signs and submits a separation or retirement application under 7-day
        option provisions, the MPF must immediately (do not use IMMEDIATE message precedence)
        notify the assignment OPR or event selection authority by message with information addressee to
        HQ AFPC/DPPRR (for retirements) and HQ AFPC/DPPRS (for separations). If an exception to
        policy is being requested, include HQ AFPC/DPAPP as an information addressee. For colonels
        (including selects), advise AFCMOA only. The subject of the message should be "Officer 7-Day
        Option." Do not delay this message notification pending complete base level processing of mem-
        ber's request. Include in the message the officer's identification data, date officer officially noti-
        fied of the event, and the requested separation or retirement date. If an exception to policy is also
        being requested, state the exception requested (including any waivers required). For requests
        requiring an exception to 7-day option provisions, attach the exception request to the separation or
        retirement request and submit out of system to HQ AFPC/DPPRR, for retirements, and HQ
        AFPC/DPPRS, for separations. Upon receipt of the retirement or separation request, the request
        for exception will be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAPP to obtain a recommendation and for coordi-
        nation with the assignment OPR. Send requests for colonels (including selects) to AFCMOA.
     2.37.3. Airmen. Airmen selected for PCS, TDY, or training (PCS or TDY), who do not want to par-
     ticipate in an event may elect to request retirement under 7-day option provisions. Airmen who elect
     to retire are ineligible for promotion consideration and are ineligible for extension of enlistment or
     reenlistment, except as authorized per AFI 36-2606 in conjunction with a request for retirement.
     Aside from 7-day option provisions, airmen who do not have the minimum required retainability for
     the event or the associated ADSC may be eligible to decline to obtain retainability as outlined in para-
     graph 2.29. Airmen fall into four major categories as shown below:
        2.37.3.1. Airmen who have retainability and are not eligible to request retirement in accor-
        dance with the criteria below and Table 2.9., have no options (under 7-day option provisions)
        which allow them to refuse or decline to participate in an event.
        2.37.3.2. Airmen who do not have retainability and are not eligible to request retirement in
        accordance with the criteria below and Table 2.9., are not eligible under 7-day option provisions,
        but can decline to obtain retainability as outlined in paragraph 2.29. Airmen who decline to obtain
        the minimum prescribed retainability may be directed to participate in the event when the required
        retainability is waived or in any event for which they have retainability. NOTE: Airmen who are
        not eligible to request retirement at the time of PCS notification and who decline to obtain retain-
        ability (which renders them ineligible for promotion or to further extend or reenlist) may still be
        permitted to retire if they will reach retirement eligibility before the DOS they have as of the date
        of declination and they are otherwise eligible in accordance with AFI 36-3203.
        2.37.3.3. Airmen who do not have retainability and are eligible to request retirement in
        accordance with the criteria below and in Table 2.9. (specifically, those who meet the criterion of
        having 19 or more years TAFMS as of official PCS notification and are assigned in the CONUS
        [only]) but who decline to obtain PCS retainability instead of requesting retirement, will be
        processed as outlined in paragraph 2.29.6.3.1., and an involuntary DOS will be established
        according to paragraph 2.29.6.6. After establishment of an involuntary DOS, airmen may elect to
        retire earlier than the involuntary DOS, if otherwise eligible, but may not retire later than their
        involuntary DOS. An involuntary DOS is not an approved retirement date. Airmen must still
        apply for retirement and meet the retirement eligibility requirements as shown in AFI 36-3203.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                81


     2.37.3.4. Airmen who do, or do not, have retainability and are eligible to request retirement
     in accordance with the criteria below and in Table 2.9., within 7 calendar days of official PCS
     notification (month and year) and want to request retirement must submit a request for retire-
     ment, if otherwise eligible in accordance with AFI 36-3203. Airmen must ask for a retirement
     date that is within their current enlistment, or current enlistment as extended. When an airman's
     current DOS is before a requested retirement date authorized by 7-day option provisions, airmen
     may submit a request for extension of enlistment along with their retirement request. In accor-
     dance with AFI 36-2606, the period of extension may not be longer than necessary to allow retire-
     ment on the requested date and may not exceed 12 months. The following additional instructions
     apply:
        2.37.3.4.1. Assigned in CONUS. Airmen who are eligible to retire (20 years TAFMS or
        more), or who will reach retirement eligibility within 6 months following notification, may
        request a retirement date not later than the first day of the seventh month following PCS noti-
        fication. Do not count the notification month. If eligible, an earlier retirement date may be
        requested as authorized in AFI 36-3203. As an exception to the latest retirement date permit-
        ted above, airmen who will reach retirement eligibility within the 7 to 12 month period follow-
        ing PCS notification may also request retirement, but are restricted to requesting a date which
        is not later than the first day of the month following the month in which retirement eligibility
        is reached.
           Example A: An airman who has 19 years and 6 months TAFMS, or more, as of PCS noti-
        fication in Feb 98 may request a retirement date not later than 1 Sep 98.
           Example B: First. An airman who has 19 years and 3 months TAFMS as of PCS notifica-
        tion in Feb 98 may request a retirement date not later than 1 Dec 98. In this instance, the mem-
        ber's TAFMSD is Nov 78 and retirement eligibility is reached in Nov 98. Member's must
        retire on the first day of the month following the month in which retirement eligibility is
        reached.
                         Second. In the case of an airman with 19 years TAFMS as of PCS notification
        (for example TAFMSD in Feb 79 and notified of PCS selection in Feb 98) who will reach
        retirement eligibility in the 12th month following PCS notification, the airman may request a
        retirement date not later than 1 Mar 99. In this instance only, since the member must retire on
        the first day of the month following the month in which retirement eligibility is reached, then
        retirement is authorized on the first day of the 13th month following PCS notification.
        2.37.3.4.2. Assigned OS. Airmen must request a retirement date which is the first day of the
        month following DEROS, if otherwise eligible to retire on that date per AFI 36-3203, Service
        Retirements. Airmen who want to retire after present assignment but the date they desire is
        after their current DEROS, must request a voluntary extension of OS tour to satisfy the
        requirement of retiring on the first day of the month following DEROS (as extended). This
        extension must be completed before establishment of an ASD as shown in Table 2.8. and
        paragraph 2.30. Once an ASD has been established, airmen who desire to retire on a date other
        than the first day of the month following DEROS must request an exception to policy per para-
        graph 1.5. Airmen who have an ADSC beyond their DEROS must either request an extension
        of DEROS as outlined above so their ADSC is completed as of the requested separation or
        retirement date, or they may request an exception to policy (with waiver of ADSC). Seven day
82                                                AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


        option provisions apply during the period between establishment of an ASD and up to 7 calen-
        dar days following official notification of end assignment. Requests submitted more than 7
        calendar days after official notification of end assignment or requests from airmen who do not
        meet the eligibility criteria must be submitted as an exception to policy per paragraph 1.5.
        Because airmen must retire in conjunction with their DEROS, airmen who have an indefinite
        DEROS who want to retire after present assignment must request a specific DEROS be estab-
        lished as outlined in paragraph 3.8.5. The request to establish a DEROS and the retirement
        request should be submitted together when the requested DEROS results in an ASD being
        established.
        2.37.3.4.3. Completing a CONUS Maximum Stabilized Tour. Airmen completing a CONUS
        maximum stabilized tour (AAC 50) who desire to retire after present assignment and who are
        otherwise eligible to retire per AFI 36-3203, must request a retirement date which is the first
        day of the month following the maximum tour date of availability. An ASD is established as
        shown in Table 2.8. and airmen are limited after receiving an ASD in the retirement date they
        may request, unless they request an exception to policy. Airmen who are not eligible to retire
        on the tour completion date, but will be eligible for retirement within the 12-month period fol-
        lowing official PCS notification, may apply for retirement if the requested date is not later
        than the first day of the month following the month in which retirement eligibility is reached.
        2.37.3.4.4. Mandatory PCS Moves. When PCS is a mandatory move (see Attachment 1,
        Definitions) and PCS is necessary before an approved retirement date or a requested retire-
        ment date, the circumstances will be forwarded to the MAJCOM for consideration. If the cir-
        cumstances cannot be resolved by the MAJCOM, the MAJCOM will forward the case for
        resolution as an exception to policy per paragraph 1.5.
     2.37.3.5. In-System/Out-of-System Retirement Requests. When an airman applies for retirement
     and the request for retirement is submitted in system, an AF Form 964 is not required and a rec-
     lama of the assignment is not required. When eligible airmen request retirement "in lieu of" PCS,
     do not reclama the assignment or complete AF Form 964. The in system retirement applica-
     tion (with the reason for retirement as special program ID code "72") serves as the reclama and
     automatically updates AAC 09. When a request is submitted out of system, for example, when an
     exception to policy is being requested, then use the signed AF Form 1160 as the source docu-
     ment and you must update AAC 09 and submit a reclama to the assignment OPR. Submit
     the retirement request along with the exception to policy to HQ AFPC/DPPRR. That office will
     separate the exception request and forwarded it to HQ AFPC/DPAPP for a recommendation on the
     exception to policy. If the retirement request is disapproved, the airman complies with the assign-
     ment instructions. If the retirement request is approved, an assignment cancellation is automati-
     cally generated to the MPF and the assignment OPR.
     2.37.3.6. Second 7-Day Option. Airmen are authorized an additional opportunity (second 7-day
     option period) in which to request retirement, if eligible, when notified of a change of end assign-
     ment before departure on PCS, or when a change of assignment data requires additional retainabil-
     ity. When additional retainability is required and airmen are not eligible to request retirement,
     airmen who do not have the additional retainability may be eligible to decline to obtain retainabil-
     ity per paragraph 2.29. Airmen who are not eligible to request retirement and airmen who have
     the additional retainability have no options under 7-day option provisions. An additional 7-day
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    83


       option period is not authorized when the change of end assignment or change in assignment data
       was the result of an airman's request for the change. Following are some examples:
          Example A: An airman was not eligible to retire in lieu of PCS when originally selected. If the
       end assignment location changes and since original selection the airman has become eligible to
       retire in lieu of PCS, then the airman may request retirement when notified of the change of end
       assignment, whether or not they have retainability for the change is not a factor.
          Example B: An airman had or obtained retainability when originally selected for PCS and was
       not then and is not now eligible to request retirement under 7-day option provisions. The RNLTD
       is delayed for 3 months, the airman does not have the additional retainability required and refuses
       to obtain it. This airman could; however, decline to obtain retainability and then a decision would
       have to be made if the RNLTD should revert back, retainability waived, or the assignment can-
       celed.

2.38. Pregnant Civilian Wife. A member may request consideration not to be en route PCS during the
12-week closed period during which his civilian wife is expected to give child birth. The 12-week closed
period is 6 weeks before and 6 weeks after the expected delivery date. This provision applies only when
the wife will actually relocate as a result of PCS and the member’s movement at an alternate time is com-
patible with AF requirements. The intent, to the degree practical, is to enable a member to accompany his
wife and relocate her at a time of less difficulty, hardship, or risk. It is not intended to ensure the mem-
ber’s presence at the time of birth. Sometimes it may be necessary for a member to be en route PCS dur-
ing this 12-week closed period, for example, when PCS involves TDY en route for training which cannot
be rescheduled. When a member’s presence is medically essential during birth, the member may request
consideration for humanitarian deferment as outlined in Attachment 7.
   2.38.1. A request not to be en route PCS during the 12-week closed period must be submitted by the
   member, in writing, to the relocations element of the servicing MPF within 7 calendar days after offi-
   cial assignment notification, or immediately after the date a member’s wife is diagnosed as pregnant.
   Include in the request the action the member desires and state where the wife will move from and to.
   Attach a statement from the attending physician indicating the expected delivery date. The MPF will
   reclama to the assignment OPR and include the pertinent information. Members will receive consid-
   eration for change of PCS as follows:
       2.38.1.1. A member serving OS and accompanied by his wife (regardless of command sponsor-
       ship status) may request consideration of a voluntary extension of OS tour as outlined in paragraph
       3.8.6. A member may request a curtailment when the attending physician recommends curtail-
       ment, in writing, based on medical reasons (see Table 3.11.). Extension or curtailment requests
       must be submitted without delay.
       2.38.1.2. A member serving in the CONUS whose wife is expected to give birth during the report-
       ing month, the month before, or the month after, and the assignment is:
           2.38.1.2.1. CONUS to CONUS. The member should first determine if adjustment of personal
           travel or leave plans is possible to avoid relocation during the 12-week closed period. How-
           ever, if adjustment of departure date necessitates a change of RNLTD, the MPF reclamas to the
           assignment OPR and provides the estimated date of delivery and the requested RNLTD. The
           assignment OPR will determine if the assignment will remain firm, if the RNLTD will be
           accelerated or delayed, or if some other action is necessary.
84                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


            2.38.1.2.2. CONUS to OS. The MPF reclamas to the assignment OPR and provides the esti-
            mated date of delivery and the requested RNLTD. The assignment OPR will determine if the
            assignment will remain firm, if the RNLTD will be accelerated or delayed, or if some other
            action is necessary.
        2.38.1.3. Exceptions to the above provisions may be requested according to the criteria in para-
        graph 1.5. Exceptions based on medical reasons must contain a statement from the attending phy-
        sician supporting the member’s request.

2.39. Pregnant Members. A member who is medically confirmed as pregnant is not normally reas-
signed PCS while pregnant, except as provided for below. On receipt of AF Form 422, Physical Profile
Serial Report, confirming pregnancy, the MPF will input AAC 81 according to the instructions in Table
2.1., and ALC “A” according to paragraph 2.39.5. and Table 2.2.
     2.39.1. The MPF will reclama assignments as follows:
        2.39.1.1. To any OS location (long or short tour location).
        2.39.1.2. Within the CONUS when the RNLTD is after the sixth month of pregnancy and the
        move is not a mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1).
        2.39.1.3. To a CONUS-isolated station listed in Attachment 3.
     2.39.2. Members OS will be curtailed due to pregnancy as follows (also see Table 3.11.).
        2.39.2.1. When the child is to be placed out for adoption. Return of an unmarried female member
        to the CONUS is necessary to prevent possible problems of citizenship for the child in the future.
        This provision does not apply to members assigned to Alaska, Hawaii, or those other locations
        outside the CONUS if a child of a military member is a US citizen at birth.
        2.39.2.2. Lack of obstetrical care or other medical considerations require the member be returned
        to the CONUS before DEROS.
        2.39.2.3. The member is assigned to a dependent-restricted location (that is, there is no accompa-
        nied-by-dependents tour authorized at that location, see Table 3.1.).
        2.39.2.4. The member is assigned to a location where the unaccompanied tour length is less than
        18 months and even though there may be an accompanied tour length authorized at the location,
        the member is not eligible, cannot qualify for, or is not permitted to serve an accompanied tour.
        The considerations here are family quarters, command sponsorship, and so on, not the availability
        of medical care.
     2.39.3. Pregnant members in a mandatory PCS status (see Attachment 1) will not be reassigned:
        2.39.3.1. To any OS location (long or short tour).
        2.39.3.2. To any CONUS location during the 12-week closed period (6 weeks before or 6 weeks
        after expected delivery date).
     2.39.4. During the 4-month period after the birth of a child to a member, deferment from PCS for the
     purpose of bonding may be authorized as follows (see Table 2.2., ALC “A”). The intent is not to
     cause the mother and child to be separated during this 4-month period. The female member may
     waive this deferment. Unless the member waives the deferment, she is not to depart on PCS to an OS
     location where the unaccompanied tour length is less than 18 months unless permission has been
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  85


   granted to serve the accompanied by dependents tour (when an accompanied tour is authorized).
   Regardless of the tour length of the OS location, concurrent travel must have been granted so the
   mother and child could travel OS together. The 4-month post-delivery deferment is not authorized if
   approval has been granted for the mother and child to travel OS concurrently. The 4-month deferment
   applies to any TDY.
   2.39.5. Requests from pregnant members to proceed on PCS other than as permitted above may be
   submitted as an exception according to paragraph 1.5. A medical statement from the attending physi-
   cian must be included supporting the member’s request.

2.40. Assignment Quality Control. All members are responsible for meeting the AF quality standards
to remain on active duty. Commanders must take appropriate rehabilitative, administrative, or disciplin-
ary action for substandard members. The assignment quality control program establishes the minimum
AF standards members must meet to be eligible for PCS reassignment.
   2.40.1. It is imperative commanders continuously monitor members selected for reassignment until
   they depart. If an act or event disqualifies a member from reassignment before departure the com-
   mander must promptly request cancellation of the assignment to prevent personal hardship on the
   member and detrimental impact on the AF mission. Commanders must prevent the reassignment of
   members with known deficiencies and ensure action is initiated to defer selection for assignment until
   the deficiencies have been corrected.
   2.40.2. Although a member may be in a mandatory PCS status (see Attachment 1) or technically
   meet the eligibility criteria for PCS reassignment prescribed in this instruction, there may be perfor-
   mance, conduct, or other quality standards problems. All administrative (including dismissal/dis-
   charge) and disciplinary action must be considered and completed before a member is allowed to
   depart on PCS. When all appropriate action could not be taken before departure, then the losing unit
   commander formally notifies the gaining unit commander in writing of the reason(s) why the assign-
   ment was not canceled or administrative (including dismissal/discharge), disciplinary, or other action
   was not taken. This notification must be made as soon as possible and include a comprehensive anal-
   ysis of the job-related or personal problems, and what rehabilitative, administrative, or disciplinary
   action has been taken.
   2.40.3. Assignment Ineligibility Criteria. The criteria listed below applies to all PCS moves except a
   mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1). Usually, exceptions will not be considered except for approved
   humanitarian or EFMP assignment (Attachment 7), or for severe personal hardships that develop as
   a direct result of a short notice assignment cancellation. Requests for exceptions of quality control
   standards require losing MAJCOM/DPA approval and are forwarded for final decision to HQ AFPC/
   DPAPP1 for lieutenant colonels and below, and to AFCMOA for colonels and colonel selects.
       2.40.3.1. Members in the following categories are ineligible for reassignment as indicated
       (RNLTD change will not be requested nor date of availability [DOA] changed to make a member
       eligible).
       2.40.3.2. AAC 10, airmen nonselected for reenlistment, except mandatory PCS (see Attachment
       1).
       2.40.3.3. AAC 12, members who are serving Article 15, UCMJ punishment, if DOA is after the
       departure date.
86                                                AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     2.40.3.4. AAC 15, members pending charges or trial by court-martial or civil court, if DOA is
     after the departure date.
     2.40.3.5. AAC 16, members undergoing an observation period on the control roster, if DOA is
     after the departure date.
     2.40.3.6. AAC 17, members under AFOSI or Security Forces investigation, if DOA is after the
     departure date (excludes normal security clearance investigations).
     2.40.3.7. AAC 19, Members whose most recent performance report (OPR/EPR) or final PCS per-
     formance report will be a referral report as defined in AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evalua-
     tion, System. If the member’s DOA (AAC 19 expiration date) is after the projected departure,
     except for mandatory PCS (see attachament 1) the member is ineligible to proceed on assignment.
     In addition, airmen whose most recent EPR, or final PCS EPR is or will be a promotion recom-
     mendation of “1” or “2,” except mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1).
     2.40.3.8. AAC 21, members with involuntary separation action initiated or recommended against
     them; members undergoing Article 32 investigations; officers found not qualified for promotion to
     first lieutenant; airmen with an administrative demotion action initiated or planned; or when there
     are other reasons that, in the opinion of the commander, should bar the member from reassign-
     ment. Prior to PDS update of AAC 21 for "other reasons" the commander, through the
     MPF, must provide the specific justification. Advance approval is required from HQ AFPC/
     DPAPP for lieutenant colonels and below, or AFCMOA for colonel and colonel selects.
     2.40.3.9. Members making unsatisfactory progress (weight control status code "2") in the Weight
     Management Program (WMP). For TDY or PCS to attend PME, members must not be in the
     WMP (weight control status codes “0”, "1", "2", or "6"). In addition, when TDY or PCS is for
     PME, members will be weighed and measured NET 30 days and NLT 10 days before departure,
     and those found exceeding the AF body fat standards shown in AFI 40-502, The Weight Manage-
     ment Program, will be enrolled in the WMP and will not be allowed to depart.
     2.40.3.10. Airmen with an approved administrative discharge which has been suspended for a
     period of probation and rehabilitation (separation ID Code "T", AFI 36-3208, Administrative Sep-
     aration of Airmen).
     2.40.3.11. Airmen not recommended for further upgrade training or removed from training for
     failure to progress (Training Status Code "T", AFI 36-2201, Developing, Managing, and Conduct-
     ing Training.
     2.40.3.12. Members who are financially irresponsible. Assignment restriction is based on the
     resultant administrative or disciplinary action and is not initiated as a direct result of this para-
     graph.
     2.40.3.13. Members are ineligible to apply for any of the following self-initiated assignment
     actions while in AAC 10 through 21 (excluding 14), regardless of DOA: COT, OS follow-on (as
     an exception, members may submit an out of system request to the assignment OPR for consider-
     ation for a CONUS follow-on provided they can get the required retainability prior to departure on
     PCS and prior to using any follow-on PCS entitlements), join spouse, CONUS-isolated, expanded
     permissive, CONUS assignment exchange, and, for airmen only, BOP, VSBAP, and VECAP.
     2.40.3.14. COTs and follow-on assignments OS are not mandatory PCS moves. When a member
     assigned OS, who has been selected for a COT or follow-on OS assignment, falls in any of the
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    87


     PCS ineligible categories listed in paragraph 2.40.3., the assignment will be canceled whenever
     the DOA is after the current DEROS.
  2.40.4. If at any time during an OS tour a member falls in any of the categories listed below, cancel-
  lation of an approved COT or follow-on OS assignment should be considered. When the member's
  commander or MPF Commander determine it is appropriate to cancel a COT or follow-on OS assign-
  ment based on any of these circumstances, the MPF will request cancellation of the assignment and
  provide HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 complete specifics, to include the commander's recommendation and
  comments.
     2.40.4.1. The member or dependents have been involved in an unfavorable incident with foreign
     nationals during the current OS tour.
     2.40.4.2. The member has family problems which could be aggravated by continued OS assign-
     ment.
     2.40.4.3. There is evidence of poor performance or conduct (substantiated by OPRs/EPRs and/or
     a substantial and current unfavorable information file [UIF]) during the current OS assignment
     that may negate productivity in another OS area.
     2.40.4.4. There is evidence the member or dependents have medical problems to the degree that
     continued OS assignment is not recommended by medical authorities. The appropriate evidence
     should be provided by medical officers.
     2.40.4.5. There are other factors that, in the opinion of the commander, are or may be detrimental
     to the AF if the member is continued in an OS area.
  2.40.5. Procedures. Upon receipt of an assignment notification, the MPF reviews the member's
  record to determine eligibility for the assignment and completes one of the following actions:
     2.40.5.1. If any of the conditions in paragraphs 2.40.3. or 2.40.4. exist, or the MPF believes the
     assignment should be canceled (UIF is substantial and current, etc.), the MPF notifies the mem-
     ber's commander of the need to request cancellation of the assignment and the reasons for such
     action. When the member's commander confirms the assignment should be canceled, the MPF
     reclamas the assignment to the assignment OPR.
     2.40.5.2. When the MPF review indicates the member appears to meet quality standards, the PCS
     notification is forwarded to the member's commander. The commander is referred to this para-
     graph to help determine the member's suitability for the assignment. Coordination with the mem-
     ber's immediate supervisor and appropriate base agencies may be necessary to confirm assignment
     eligibility. If there is evidence of substandard performance or conduct (not previously recorded)
     which would disqualify the member for PCS, the commander returns the PCS notification to the
     MPF and includes a letter/memorandum requesting the assignment be canceled providing the spe-
     cific reasons and the corrective or disciplinary action that has or will be taken. If this notification
     is based on data not already part of the UIF, or is based on contemplated action, it is filed in the
     member's UPRG until eligibility is restored.
     2.40.5.3. If there is a disagreement on a member's assignment eligibility it is resolved at the next
     higher level of command.
  2.40.6. Mandatory PCS Assignments. OS returnees, members surplus to requirements, members dis-
  qualified to remain at a special duty assignment, and members relieved from duty for cause, although
88                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     mandatory availables, are not exempt from quality control action required by paragraph 2.40. Those
     administrative or disciplinary actions which are appropriate must be taken and should be completed
     before a member is reassigned. When all appropriate action has not been taken/completed, the reas-
     signment must be approved by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1.
     2.40.7. Requests for Assignment Cancellation or Requests for Quality Reviews. A request from a
     gaining commander, MPF, or MAJCOM for cancellation of assignment or for an assignment quality
     review is appropriate only if some new PCS disqualifying factor becomes known that was not consid-
     ered in the assignment selection process or by the losing commander or MPF. Current UIF contents,
     previous OPRs/EPRs, and past rehabilitative, administrative, or disciplinary actions are not a
     basis to challenge an assignment nor is the fact a member has a current quality control AAC,
     provided it expires before the departure date. The following steps and procedures apply if a
     request for assignment cancellation or quality review becomes necessary. (Ensure an information
     copy of all correspondence is provided to the losing and gaining MAJCOMs and HQ AFPC/
     DPAPP1).
        2.40.7.1. A request will be sent from the gaining MSS/CC or MPF Commander to the losing
        MSS/CC or MPF Commander who should review the case with the losing commander to deter-
        mine if the member meets the minimum PCS standards.
        2.40.7.2. If the losing commander agrees that the assignment should be canceled, the losing MSS/
        CC or MPF Commander requests cancellation from HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 and provides the specific
        reasons for the disqualification and indicates the rehabilitative, administrative, or disciplinary
        action taken by the commander (i.e., control roster, Article 15, etc.).
        2.40.7.3. If the losing commander confirms the member is qualified for the assignment, the losing
        MSS/CC or MPF Commander advises the gaining MSS/CC or MPF Commander. If the gaining
        commander still does not agree, then the gaining MSS/CC or MPF Commander elevates the case
        to the gaining MAJCOM, with information to the losing MAJCOM.
        2.40.7.4. The gaining MAJCOM reviews the case and if assignment cancellation appears appro-
        priate, provides HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 specifics to justify assignment cancellation. Final decision
        on assignment cancellation rests with HQ AFPC/DPAPP1.
     2.40.8. Requests to Return Unqualified Personnel. Members who have departed PCS will not be
     returned to the losing unit except in those cases specifically authorized by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1. Based
     on PCS costs and personal hardships which may result, return will normally be approved only when
     the action for which the return is requested cannot be completed at the gaining unit. Requests to return
     members for the purpose of administering disciplinary actions such as Article 15, letters of reprimand,
     or control roster and weight control actions will usually not be approved. Such actions can be com-
     pleted at the gaining location. When it is appropriate, the losing MAJCOM sends all available infor-
     mation, including correspondence from the gaining MAJCOM, to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 for a final
     decision on the return request.
     2.40.9. Compliance Responsibilities. Compliance with these procedures is the inherent responsibility
     of both commanders and the personnel staff. Commanders have the ultimate responsibility of ensur-
     ing only quality personnel are retained in the AF and permitted to be reassigned. Decisions to cancel,
     reassign, or return members will be based on the overall best interest of the AF. The intent is to ensure
     that a member's problems are resolved (through rehabilitation, dismissal, or discharge) at the location
     where they arose. On an individual basis, AFCMOA for colonel and colonel selects, and HQ AFPC/
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                   89


   DPAPP1, for lieutenant colonel and below and all airmen, may direct the cancellation of an assign-
   ment, diversion to another base, waiver of PCS disqualifying factors, or the return of a member to the
   losing base when such action is clearly in the best interest of the AF.

2.41. Reporting of Disqualified Officers/Airmen and Officers Eliminated from Flying or Technical
Training.
   2.41.1. Disqualified Officers/Airmen.
      2.41.1.1. Operations Officers (Rated and Nonrated). Within 5 workdays of being advised by the
      unit commander, that an operation officer has been disqualified for aviation service according to
      the process shown in AFI 11-402, the servicing MPF will notify the member’s parent MAJCOM
      operations officer assignment function. The notification will contacin the information shown in
      Figure 2.3. When the disqualification is for medical reasons (Aviation Service Code "03"),
      include HQ AFPC/DPAMM as an addressee and include the diagnosis, prognosis, date of hospi-
      talization, injury or illness and any limitations or restrictions on duty assignment. Identify the
      message as UNCLAS FOUO (Sensitive Data). The MAJCOM will review the officer's AFSC and
      location preferences, commander's comments and within 5 work days advise HQ AFPC/DPASF
      of recommended utilization and assignment. Within 5 work days of receipt of the MAJCOM’s rec-
      ommendation, HQ AFPC/DPASF (or other assignment OPR when appropriate) will provide
      assignment instructions.
      2.41.1.2. Support Officers. Within 5 work days of being advised by the unit commander, the ser-
      vicing MPF will report to the member's parent MAJCOM support officers disqualified from per-
      forming in their current DAFSC (for example, permanently PRP decertified or medically
      disqualified) by message in the format in Figure 2.4. For medical disqualification, include the
      diagnosis, prognosis, date of hospitalization, injury or illness, and any limitations or restrictions
      on duty assignment. Identify the message as UNCLAS FOUO (Sensitive Data). The MAJCOM
      will review the officer's preferences, commander's comments and within 5 work days advise HQ
      AFPC/DPASF of recommended utilization and assignment. Within 5 work days of receipt of the
      MAJCOM's recommendations, HQ AFPC/DPASF (or other assignment OPR when appropriate)
      will provide assignment instructions.
      2.41.1.3. Airmen. Within 5 workdays of completion of action per AFI 36-2101, Classifying Mil-
      itary Personnel (Officers and Airmen), the servicing MPF will report disqualified airmen to the
      member's parent MAJCOM and include the HQ AFPC assignment OPR as an information
      addressee. Be sure to include any additional pertinent information and if there is any administra-
      tive or disciplinary action pending and the details. For medical disqualification, include the diag-
      nosis, prognosis, date of hospitalization, injury or illness, and any limitations or restrictions on
      duty assignment. Identify the message as UNCLAS FOUO (Sensitive Data). The MAJCOM will
      review the data and commander's comments and within 5 work days advise the assignment OPR
      of recommended utilization and assignment. The assignment OPR will provide assignment
      instructions within 5 workdays of receipt of the MAJCOM recommendation.
   2.41.2. Officers Eliminated from Flying Training or Technical Training. When an officer is attending
   flying training or technical training in PCS status, or TDY en route PCS status, and is formally elimi-
   nated from training, then the commander will report the elimination to the servicing MPF within 5
   workdays of elimination. Within 5 workdays of being notified by a commander, the servicing MPF
   will report officers attending flying training to HQ AFPC/DPAOT1, and officers attending technical

2.42. Controlled Duty Assignment (CDA) (Airmen). The CDA is a tool to ensure effective utilization
of trained personnel and requires assignment of airmen for a minimum specified period of time in the
career field in which he or she received training, or for enlisted aircrews, requires assignment within a
career field or AFSC to the specific major weapons system (MWS) in which training is received. The
CDA is in addition to the ADSC for training. The ADSC obligates the individual to serve on active duty
for a specified period while the CDA controls the duty assignment.
   2.42.1. Airmen with CDA reasons code G (technical training) or E (aircrew training) may be assigned
   to any job or activity in the normal progression career field ladder for their AFSC. Airmen must not
   be scheduled for retraining or be assigned out of the CDA AFSC and MWS for aircrews before com-
   pleting the CDA for which obligated. The CDAs for training normally are provided by a training allo-
   cation (TNGALC) RIP. In those cases where the CDA is not included with notification, the MPF will
   immediately contact the selection authority to obtain the CDA data.
94                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


     2.42.2. Airmen who decline to obtain service retainability to fulfill CDA requirements are processed
     according to paragraph 2.29.6.3.1. for career airmen or paragraph 2.29.6.3.2. for FTA. The MPF will
     update AAC 08 for these airmen. Airmen who decline to obtain retainability are still eligible for any
     training or assignment for which they have service retainability, or the CDA retainability may be
     waived.
     2.42.3. Waivers of CDA may be considered on a case-by-case basis to permit an airman with insuffi-
     cient CDA retainability to attend training. CDA waiver must be approved by the appropriate assign-
     ment OPR.
     2.42.4. Normally the responsible technical training center will update the PDS with the CDA reason
     and expiration date.

2.43. Advance Academic Degree (AAD) Assignment (Officers). This paragraph implements DoD
Directive 1322.10 and AFI 36-2302, Professional Development. Officers who receive advance degrees
(Masters or Doctors of Philosophy [Ph.D.]) through fully funded programs, must be assigned for a mini-
mum of 3 years to a manpower authorization which requires their specific degree and academic discipline
(that is, an AAD position). It is the intent that officers be assigned to an AAD position initially following
graduation. When, for operational reasons, immediate assignment upon graduation to an AAD position is
not possible, a waiver must be requested and approval granted to delay fulfilling the 3 year AAD assign-
ment requirement until the second assignment after graduation. Assignment OPRs, MAJCOMs, and com-
manders are responsible for ensuring proper utilization and assignment of officers who receive AADs.
Therefore, during the 3 year period following graduation, or in instances where a waiver to delay AAD
assignment has been granted, any change in duty position of the officer requires the advance approval of
the assignment OPR. Additionally, HQ AFPC/DPAPE must coordinate on assignments of officers
awarded an AFIT-sponsored AAD. When assignment to an AAD position is not possible as the second
assignment following graduation, then consideration may be given to permanently waiving the require-
ment to serve 3 years in an AAD position. The requirement to serve 3 years in an AAD position is in addi-
tion to an ADSC requirement (see AFI 36-2107, table 1.6), or mandatory utilization requirement (see
paragraph 2.41.). For example, an officer graduates from a Master's degree program sponsored by AFIT
but because of vulnerability for an OS involuntary short tour assignment, the officer is not assigned imme-
diately upon graduation to an AAD position. A waiver must be granted to delay assignment to an AAD
position until the officer completes the OS tour. Upon return from OS, a requirement still exists to assign
the officer to an AAD position for 3 years (even though a portion of the ADSC for the Master's degree has
been served). When upon return from OS, for operational reasons the officer still cannot be assigned to an
AAD position, then a waiver must be granted. As stated above, at this time consideration should be given
to permanently waiving the requirement to be assigned to an AAD position.
     2.43.1. A waiver request must be processed through the MAJCOM/DP for a recommendation by the
     MAJCOM/CV. When approval is recommended, the MAJCOM forwards the request to the assign-
     ment OPR. Assignment OPRs may also initiate waiver requests. HQ AFPC/DPA is the waiver
     authority.
     2.43.2. HQ AFPC/DPAP is responsible for the centralized selection and management of PhDs and
     masters degree candidates in AFIT training programs. Officers volunteer through their functional
     assignment team which, in turn, prepares nominations for the HQ AFPC AFIT Selection Board.
     AFIT/MSP matches officers to requirements at specific colleges/universities and HQ AFPC/DPAPE
     is responsible for directing assignments of officers.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    95


   2.43.3. Assignment OPRs give priority assignment consideration to officers who have obtained
   AADs through fully-funded programs; however, officers possessing AADs earned by other means
   will also be used to fill AAD requirements whenever possible.

2.44. Assignment of Members Who Were Previously Designated as "Missing" (Including PWs/
MIAs). Members placed in a "missing" casualty status as the result of hostilities, either armed conflict or
terrorist activities, are normally given an assignment limitation upon their return to US control. This lim-
itation applies only to members who subsequent to being declared missing are officially categorized as
Missing in Action (MIA), Captured (PW), Beleaguered, Besieged, Detained (Hostage), or Interned as
defined in AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services.
   2.44.1. The purpose of this provision is to limit assignment, TDY, or PCS to areas where members are
   not accessible to the same combatants, terrorists, or nations sympathetic with the combatants or terror-
   ists. This limitation is void in the event of general mobilization. Members may request the assign-
   ment limitation be removed; however, the limitation is not automatically removed based solely on the
   member's request. A request for removal may be disapproved and the assignment limitation contin-
   ued when the limitation is considered to be in the best interests of the AF, for example, based on secu-
   rity considerations. When a member submits a request for removal, HQ AFPC/DPAPP will staff the
   request to determine if removal is appropriate and advise the member, servicing MPF Commander,
   and member's commander of approval or disapproval.
   2.44.2. HQ AFPC/DPAPP, in conjunction with HQ AFPC/DPWCM, Missing Persons Branch, and
   other activities when necessary, will determine when action should be taken or continued in conjunc-
   tion with this paragraph to limit future assignment. Upon member's return to US control, HQ AFPC/
   DPWCM will provide HQ AFPC/DPAPP a copy of DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty. In turn, HQ
   AFPC/DPAPP will issue a memorandum as a source document, with the DD Form 1300 as an attach-
   ment, to the servicing MPF Commander, with an information copy to the member's unit commander
   and the member, directing update of ALC “7” in the PDS, which will automatically update deploy-
   ment availability code "79." The memorandum instructs the MPF Commander to contact and brief
   the member on the assignment limitation. Unless the member requests, in writing, to HQ AFPC/
   DPAPP that the limitation be removed and the removal request is approved, then the member is
   restricted from PCS and/or TDY as stated above. File the correspondence in the member's UPRG.

2.45. Officer Duty Changes (Lieutenant Colonel and below). Duty changes are centrally managed by
the assignment OPR via the Duty AFSC (DAFSC) change request process. All levels of command, all
supervisors, and all personnel and assignment managers share responsibility and accountability for utili-
zation and assignment of officers in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible. However, the
assignment OPR is primarily responsible and accountable for inventory control of the number of officers
serving in each AFSC and ensuring officers are utilized consistent with law; Congressional, DoD, and HQ
USAF functional area OPR directions; AF directives and instructions; and other guidance.
   2.45.1. The following general rules apply to duty change requests:
       2.45.1.1. Any level of command may initiate a DAFSC change request for operational reasons.
       2.45.1.2. Approval of a duty change in itself does not guarantee an officer will continue perma-
       nently to serve in the new duty or for a specified period of time. MAJCOMs may request defer-
       ment (AAC 39) not to exceed 12 months for officers who receive an approved duty change from
       one utilization field to another based on operational needs.
96                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


        2.45.1.3. Only career officers (see Attachment 1), may request a change of duty to a different uti-
        lization field. Officers with a DOS within 90 days of the date of a request and those with an ASD
        are not eligible to request a duty change. Members may request a change of utilization field by
        submitting a duty (DAFSC) change request if they believe the change will result in better utiliza-
        tion of their qualifications to meet AF requirements. Duty changes for professional development
        may be disapproved when an officer’s performance in current duty is unsatisfactory, when they do
        not meet the prerequisites for entry into the requested AFSC, when the duty requested would not
        be economical use of their training and/or experience, or when overall manning in their current
        duty precludes release.
        2.45.1.4. For officers (operations (rated or nonrated) or support) disqualified from duty in their
        DAFSC and officers eliminated from flying training or technical training who are attending in
        PCS status or TDY en route PCS status, see paragraph 2.41.
        2.45.1.5. Duty change requests involving assignment/utilization (PCA or PCS) of officers in a
        different competitive category may be considered as an exception to policy as outlined in para-
        graph 1.5. Normally, PCS of members in conjunction with such assignments will not be approved.
        (NOTE: Change of a member’s DAFSC to match the DAFSC of a manpower authorization or
        change of the manpower authorization DAFSC to match an officer does not resolve the competi-
        tive category mismatch.) To change competitive categories officers may submit a request for
        competitive category transfer per AFI 36-2106.
     2.45.2. To ensure compliance with these requirements and to provide all officers fair and equitable
     opportunities, the assignment OPR is the approval authority for the following officer duty changes:
        2.45.2.1. From one utilization field to another (for example, from AFSC 11XX to 36XX).
        2.45.2.2. From the staff level to the director and commander level.
        2.45.2.3. Involving waiver of the specialty eligibility requirements. Members must meet the spe-
        cialty eligibility requirements shown in AFMAN 36-2105, Officer Classification, unless a waiver
        of the requirements has been requested and approved. The assignment OPR must be advised of
        any approved waivers when a duty change is requested. Approval of a waiver of the specialty eli-
        gibility requirements does not necessarily mean the duty change being requested will be approved.
        2.45.2.4. When it is proposed a rated officer attend a command-sponsored formal training course.
        Send proposed changes in advance to HQ AFPC/DPAO by message for approval.
        2.45.2.5. DAFSC change resulting from classification actions per AFI 36-2101, Classifying Mili-
        tary Personnel (Officers and Airmen).
     2.45.3. HQ AFPC assignment OPR approval is not required for the following duty changes:
        2.45.3.1. Normal upgrade of the DAFSC to the fully qualified level.
        2.45.3.2. Change directed by the assignment OPR incident to assignments.
        2.45.3.3. Changes as a result of completion of formal education and/or training courses.
     2.45.4. Duty change (DAFSC) requests are submitted to the MPF on AF Form 2096, Classification/
     On-the-Job-Training Action. Requests from officers must include "Self-initiated" in Section V and
     include the unit commander's recommendation in Section VI. Using data from the AF Form 2096, the
     MPF submits PTI 481/482. For MAJCOM requests, the MAJCOM submits PTI 482. Include the fol-
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  97


   lowing in the Remarks section (abbreviate to the degree the request is understandable). If necessary,
   submit out of system.
       2.45.4.1. State the reason for the request and how the best interests of the AF are served.
       2.45.4.2. Indicate if officer and commander concur or nonconcur. Concurrence is not required,
       but should be solicited.
       2.45.4.3. Indicate if operational deferment is also requested.
       2.45.4.4. For requests submitted in system by MPFs, MAJCOM recommendations, if any, must
       be submitted to the assignment OPR within 10 calendar days of receipt at the MAJCOM.

2.46. Pseudo Position Numbers (Officers). A pseudo position number (all 8's) enables MPFs to report
officer assignment data such as rated position identifier (RPI), program element code (PEC), functional
account code (FAC), and so forth, when there is no valid manpower authorization in the unit to which
assigned for the officer's DAFSC. When assigned to a valid position, most duty information is automati-
cally updated from the manpower position number. A pseudo position number must not be used to cir-
cumvent officer assignment/utilization policies. Its intended use, for example, is to report duty
assignment data for an officer who will fill an approved manpower authorization but the authorization has
not yet been updated through the manpower data system, or to record the temporary duty (TDY) assign-
ment at the same duty station of an officer as club manager due to the loss of the incumbent civilian club
manager.
   2.46.1. If a manpower position number exists for an officer's DAFSC in the unit to which assigned,
   regardless of where in the unit the officer may be physically performing duty, the officer will be
   assigned against a valid position as an alternate to the primary person assigned.
   2.46.2. The assignment OPR may use the pseudo position number to effect essential duty change
   actions or to project an assignment when the specific position number has not been determined or the
   assignment must occur despite the lack of an authorization.
   2.46.3. Colonels (including selects) will not be assigned to pseudo position numbers without the
   advance approval of the MAJCOM Senior Officer Management Office (MAJCOM/DPO), or equiva-
   lent, or AFCMOA.
   2.46.4. Rated officers assigned a rated duty AFSC and required to perform operational flying duty
   should be reported in RPI 1, 2, 6, or 8. Rated officers assigned to a rated duty AFSC but not required
   to perform operational flying duty should be report in RPI 3 or 4.

2.47. Reclama of Assignment. A reclama (or formal protest) is a request to the assignment OPR to
change or cancel a proposed or directed action. A reclama may be submitted in-system using PTI 520 or
out of system by electrical message for actions which are time sensitive or when a paragraph or attach-
ment specifies a reclama message be submitted. Message reclamas should include the gaining and losing
MAJCOMs, and the gaining MPF and unit. Be sure to include the member's identification data in the
message subject and include the projected assignment Shipping AFSC (for officers) and Control AFSC
(for airmen).
   2.47.1. In-system reclamas are usually submitted when the RNLTD is more than 120 calendar days
   from the date of the reclama using the appropriate reclama reason codes. Ensure narrative remarks are
   included to fully explain the circumstances.

     2.47.2. Out of system reclamas are usually submitted when the RNLTD is 120 days or less from the
     date of the reclama and should contain a complete explanation of the circumstances. Use a message
     for actions involving:
        2.47.2.1. Contingency assignments, or
        2.47.2.2. Unit or base activation or deactivation, or
        2.47.2.3. Weapons systems conversions, or
        2.47.2.4. Assignment was a short-notice assignment as shown in paragraph 2.32.
        2.47.2.5. Rated Officers only. When a request for cancellation of the assignment of a rated officer
        is based on a medical condition, the MPF sends a message to HQ AFPC/DPAMM, with informa-
        tion copy to HQ AFPC/DPAO, the assignment OPR, the gaining and losing MAJCOM and the
        gaining MPF and unit. This message is identified as UNCLAS FOUO (SENSITIVE DATA) and
        must include the diagnosis, prognosis, date of hospitalization (if applicable), injury or illness and
        estimated date of return to flying status. Based on this information, HQ AFPC/DPAMM will
        advise the assignment OPR if, based on medical reasons, the assignment should be canceled or
        delayed.
        2.47.2.6. Airmen only. Withdrawals from CONUS shallow-manned positions with no backfill
        identified. To avoid creating CONUS-to-CONUS manning leveling moves, MAJCOMs may rec-
        lama when selection is short notice and/or replacement is mission essential, but backfill cannot be
        effected from the command's allocations of school graduates, OS returnees, or other availables.
        2.47.2.7. Airmen only. Reclamas will not be submitted when assignment action reason (AAR) is
        E2 or has a "P" series AAR (except P7).
        2.47.2.8. Airman Aircrew Members. The MPF must reclama if airmen aircrew members receive
        less than 120 calendar days' advance notification for involuntary assignment to duty that does not
        require flying status. Use reclama reason code "AM" with trailer remarks that state: "Aircrew
        member provided less than 120 calendar days' notification. Airman notified (date). Projected
        departure date is (date)." If airman waives the 120 calendar days' notice requirement, then a rec-
        lama is not submitted.

2.48. Surplus (and Overage) Management.
     2.48.1. A surplus (including excess) exists when there are more people assigned to a location than
     there are manpower authorizations in a grade and AFSC for officers, or in a career field ladder for air-
     men. (In most cases, for airman manning purposes, a career field ladder includes manpower authori-
     zations in grades AB through SMSgt in an AFS. However, when the duties in a particular AFSC are
     significantly different than others within the AFS or in cases where AFSCs merge at certain skill lev-
     els, then, with concurrence of the assignment OPR, ladder manning may be based on specific AFSCs.)
     The fact that a condition meets the definition of surplus, in itself, does not mean that PCA or PCS
     reassignment action will be taken to resolve it. As a general guideline, PCS action is not normally jus-
     tified when a surplus is projected to be resolved in 6 months or less, such as by attrition.
     2.48.2. Per DoD direction, PCS eligibility exceptions based on surplus (for example, no waiver of
     minimum TOS required) are authorized for use only when the reason for surplus is one of those listed
     below. Reassignment for other reasons which meet the definition of surplus may be considered on a
     case-by-case or group basis according to paragraph 1.5., or it may be possible other PCS eligibility
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  99


  exceptions may be applicable (for example, no waiver of minimum TOS required for PCS to or from
  training).
     2.48.2.1. Unit inactivation, or
     2.48.2.2. Base closure or consolidation, or
     2.48.2.3. Organization or staffing changes, or
     2.48.2.4. Reclassification or loss of AFSC, or
     2.48.2.5. Promotion to the grade of colonel or CMSgt, or
     2.48.2.6. Disqualification for duty without reclassification or loss of AFSC, for example, loss of
     security clearance, SCI access, professional certification, nuclear certification, medical qualifica-
     tion, or relief from duty for cause. A person who loses qualification to perform the duties of a par-
     ticular manpower position may still possess the mandatory qualifications to hold an AFSC. In
     itself, loss of a qualification does not necessarily result in a member being surplus (or excess).
     Whenever possible, these members are reassigned to positions in their AFSC for which they are
     still qualified at the same location. However, there are times when all positions at a location
     require a particular qualification, or assignment to another position at the same location is not
     practical for some reason. In such cases, assignment requests may be submitted as exceptions
     with justification in accordance with paragraph 1.5.
  2.48.3. In keeping with DoD guidelines, surpluses will be managed by duty location. Reassignment
  to resolve a surplus will be considered in the following order:
     2.48.3.1. PCA (without PCS) intracommand, then intercommand, for duty in:
         2.48.3.1.1. Current DAFSC (officers) or CAFSC skill level (airmen); and then
         2.48.3.1.2. For duty in any awarded AFSC.
     2.48.3.2. When PCS is necessary to resolve a surplus, then:
         2.48.3.2.1. For members assigned in the CONUS, see paragraph 2.48.6.1., or
         2.48.3.2.2. If currently assigned OS, see paragraph 2.48.6.2.
     2.48.3.3. Exceptions to this order may be requested in accordance with paragraph 1.5. (For
     example, while one location may have a surplus there may be shortages at other locations. Instead
     of directing the PCA of members for duty in any awarded AFSC, the best interests of the AF might
     be served to direct PCS of a member in his or her current DAFSC for officers or CAFSC for air-
     men.)
  2.48.4. Officers. Surpluses at a location in one grade and AFSC are sometimes offset by shortages in
  other grades and such circumstances may be acceptable without assignment action. However, some-
  times the overall experience level, the particular grades in which surpluses exist, or other factors may
  warrant considering reassignment action to effect a more acceptable balance. Availability of PCS
  funds, length of time the surplus is projected to exist, and other pertinent factors will determine if
  grade and AFSC mismatches are resolved by reassignment action. Because of the variables, it is not
  possible to specify all of the circumstances when reassignment action will or will not be authorized to
  resolve a surplus. Servicing MPFs and/or MAJCOMs will report surpluses according to paragraph
  2.48.7. for a decision on whether or not reassignment action is warranted.
100                                                     AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      2.48.5. Airmen. A mismatch where the number assigned is greater than the number authorized at a
      location in various grades and/or skill levels of a career field ladder does not technically meet the def-
      inition of surplus (see paragraph 2.48.). Therefore, assignment action is not normally necessary to
      resolve these mismatches. See paragraph 2.7. However, the overall experience level, the particular
      grades and/or skill levels of the mismatches, or other factors may warrant considering reassignment
      action (PCA or PCS) to effect a more acceptable grade and/or skill level balance. Availability of PCS
      funds, length of time the problem is projected to exist, and other factors will determine the extent to
      which grade and/or skill level mismatches are resolved by reassignment action. Because of the vari-
      ables, it is not possible to specify all of the circumstances when reassignment action will or will not be
      authorized to resolve a surplus or grade and/or skill level mismatches when there is no surplus. Ser-
      vicing MPFs and/or MAJCOMs will report surpluses according to paragraph 2.48.7. for a decision on
      whether or not reassignment action is warranted.
      2.48.6. When PCS is necessary to resolve surpluses (or when PCS is requested as an exception to
      resolve airmen grade and/or skill level mismatches), the following process will be used to identify the
      order in which members should be reassigned. Note that deletion of an authorization in one squadron
      resulting in a surplus could result in a member elsewhere at the same location (for example, at wing
      level, in another MAJCOM, etc.) actually being the member (by-name) who is surplus to that loca-
      tion's total requirements. It is not necessarily the incumbent of the position which is deleted who is
      most eligible to be declared surplus to a duty station's total requirements. Members who are surplus
      who have insufficient retainability for PCS, those who must remain at a location for disciplinary
      action, members assigned OS not recommended for further OS assignment, etc., will be reported to
      the assignment OPR for disposition. Exceptions to the order prescribed below may be requested in
      accordance with paragraph 1.5. on a group or case-by-case basis.
         2.48.6.1. At a CONUS location, when a surplus exists (or, for airmen, when PCS is requested as
         an exception to resolve grade and/or skill level mismatches) the servicing MPF will arrange all
         members assigned to a location (without regard to MAJCOM) in a specific grade and AFSC for
         officers, and grade, and/or skill level and AFSC for airmen, in order of TOS (without regard to
         AACs, volunteer status for PCS, organizational level, MAJCOM, etc.) with longest TOS being the
         most eligible. Members do not volunteer to be surplus. After a member has been identified for
         PCS, then assignment preferences are considered. The MPF will advise the assignment OPR of
         the names of members identified as surplus and include as information addressees the members'
         units and parent MAJCOMs. The assignment OPR will consider MAJCOM (or equivalent)
         requests to retain individual members as exceptions. Members vulnerable for OS PCS selection
         within 24 months are selected on a priority basis for OS assignments as shown in Table 3.3. and
         Table 3.4. Members not vulnerable for OS PCS selection, or when no OS requirements exist, are
         allocated for CONUS assignment according to the guidance in paragraph 1.3.
         2.48.6.2. At an OS location, when a surplus exists (or, for airmen, when PCS is requested as an
         exception to resolve grade and/or skill level imbalances) the servicing MPF will arrange all mem-
         bers assigned to a location (without regard to MAJCOM) in a specific grade and AFSC for offic-
         ers, and grade, and/or skill level and AFSC for airmen, as shown below. Members do not
         volunteer to be surplus. After a member has been identified for PCS according to the following
         process, then assignment preferences are considered.
             2.48.6.2.1. Sequence members in order of least time remaining from date they become surplus
             to current DEROS (for example, 1 month to 36 or more months), with least number of months
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  101


         remaining to DEROS being most eligible. For members currently serving IPCOTs, compute
         time remaining to DEROS from date entered current IPCOT, not total TOS. For members who
         have approved extensions of OS tour, use time remaining to DEROS as extended, not total
         TOS. Members who have voluntary extensions of OS tours who have not entered the exten-
         sion may request cancellation in accordance with Table 3.11., rule 25. Every member on this
         list is offered the opportunity to volunteer for a consecutive OS tour (COT) according to the
         guidelines in Attachment 4. For those members ineligible for a COT, those who do not vol-
         unteer for a COT or those not selected for a COT, then proceed with the next steps below.
         2.48.6.2.2. Members accompanied by command sponsored dependents (long or short tour)
         with less than 12 months remaining who are ineligible, or do not volunteer for a COT and
         those not selected for a COT will be curtailed and reassigned to the CONUS. Similarly, mem-
         bers serving unaccompanied tours (long or short tour) with less than 7 months remaining who
         do not receive a COT will be curtailed and reassigned to the CONUS. In lieu of a waiver of
         PCS retainability, enlisted personnel may also be separated if they lack retainability for a
         CONUS PCS (see paragraph 2.29.6.5.).
         2.48.6.2.3. Then, resequence the remaining members in order of most time remaining to
         DEROS. These people will be considered for intratheater (not intertheater) PCS regardless of
         volunteer status for continuation of OS tour as follows. Continuation of OS tour (that is, PCS
         to another OS location to serve until their current DEROS or prorated DEROS) is not autho-
         rized for members serving a tour of 18 months or more who have less than 12 months remain-
         ing to current or prorated DEROS. Further, members accompanied by command sponsored
         dependents at their current OS location must satisfy all of the eligibility criteria for travel of
         dependents and be authorized concurrent travel to the continuation location. If concurrent
         travel cannot be approved, then continuation of tour will not be directed. For unaccompanied
         members serving a tour of 15 months or less, continuation of OS tour is not authorized if they
         have less than 7 months remaining to current or prorated DEROS. When all intratheater
         requirements have been filled, then any remaining surplus personnel will be curtailed and reas-
         signed to the CONUS. In lieu of a waiver of PCS retainability, enlisted personnel may also be
         separated if they lack retainability for a CONUS PCS (see paragraph 2.29.6.5.).
  2.48.7. Servicing MPFs, MAJCOMs, and assignment OPRs will continuously monitor the number of
  members assigned versus authorized and immediately report members who are projected to become
  surplus based on 6-month projected manning levels to the assignment OPR with an explanation of the
  reason for surplus. MPFs and MAJCOMs will not wait until members actually become surplus to
  report them. When surpluses are reported by an MPF or the MAJCOM, MAJCOMs may request
  approval to retain surplus members with special qualifications, training, or for other special circum-
  stances, either at the current location (as approved overages) or they may make recommendations for
  intracommand reassignment. The assignment OPR will consider a parent MAJCOM's request along
  with the requirements of other MAJCOMs at the same location and in-theater (if OS) and other appro-
  priate factors and direct PCA or PCS assignment as appropriate. Assignment OPRs are also responsi-
  ble to continuously monitor and identify surpluses and should coordinate PCA or PCS actions they
  initiate based on surpluses with the parent MAJCOM, especially when the MAJCOM or MPF has not
  reported the surpluses identified.
  2.48.8. The term overage describes a surplus (see paragraph 2.48.) which is impractical or unneces-
  sary to resolve by reassignment (PCA or PCS), or is the result of intentional action approved by the
102                                                     AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      assignment OPR. For example, an OS returnee is a mandatory move; however, if the CONUS is
      manned at over 100% at all locations, then the reassignment of a member to a location as surplus is
      described as assignment as an overage. Another example of assignment as an overage would be when
      an assignment OPR directs assignment to a unit or location where no authorization exists for the mem-
      ber's AFSC. The term overage is sometimes used in reference to other situations which do not involve
      a surplus as defined in paragraph 2.48. For example, in relation to airman manning the term overage
      may be used when there are more airmen assigned in a particular grade or skill level of an AFSC than
      authorized. While no surplus may exist as defined in paragraph 2.48., use of the term refers to a con-
      dition of more assigned than authorized.
      2.48.9. Enlisted aircrew members surplus to requirements at their current duty station are reported by
      the parent MAJCOM for PCS as indicated above. However, in conjunction with their surplus status,
      they are not to be removed from flying status at the same time they are assigned to duty in other than
      their primary aircrew AFSC, nor are they to be retrained, without approval of the assignment OPR.
      When it is determined that surplus primary aircrew members are to be removed from flying status,
      they must be managed as shown in AFI 36-2214. In cases where primary aircrew members cannot be
      effectively used in their aircrew skill, a DOA is established that is 120 calendar days after the date the
      members are told of involuntary removal from flying status. Disposition instructions cannot be effec-
      tive earlier than the DOA.

2.49. PCS Cost Identifier Code. The PCS Cost Identifier Code represents the fund cite shown in
AFMAN 65-604, Appropriation Symbols and Budget Codes. It is used primarily by budget managers for
accounting purposes. This code, to which the cost of a PCS will be charged, is provided by the assign-
ment OPR in the assignment instructions to the MPF, and will be included in PCS orders. If an MPF
Commander or base financial services officer (FSO) determines a PCS cost code is not correct, they
should advise the assignment OPR. However, base FSOs may authorize charges against a correct account
when an incorrect PCS Cost Identifier Code is cited in PCS orders without amendment of PCS orders and
without authorization for change of the code in assignment data by the assignment OPR.
      2.49.1. Members accrue PCS entitlements based on the relationship of the losing and gaining perma-
      nent (duty) stations according to the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR). The PCS Cost Identi-
      fier Code provided in assignment instructions must be compatible with the entitlements a member
      accrues according to the JFTR. Whether or not members accrue PCS entitlements per the JFTR dic-
      tates whether a PCS move must be funded or unfunded, except when the move is a permissive PCS.
         2.49.1.1. A PCS Cost Identifier Code of "unfunded" cannot be the basis for denying a member
         PCS entitlements or reimbursement for use of entitlements authorized by the JFTR. For example,
         if a PCS cost identifier code of “M - Reassignment Without Fund Allocation” is erroneously
         applied to a PCS from Travis AFB, CA to McGuire AFB, NJ (and it is not a permissive PCS), the
         member cannot be denied use of, or reimbursement for, PCS entitlements he or she accrues per the
         JFTR. The corrective action in this instance is to change the PCS cost identifier code to a funded
         move.
         2.49.1.2. Conversely, a PCS cost identifier code for a “funded” move cannot be the basis for a
         member moving at government expense if the JFTR authorizes no PCS entitlements. If the
         assignment instructions or PCS orders cite a funded PCS cost identifier code, then the code is
         without effect.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  103


2.50. No-Cost (No Entitlement) Moves. No-cost moves are those where no PCS entitlements accrue to
members. Per the JFTR, no PCS entitlements accrue to members when directed to change permanent duty
stations when both stations are within the corporate limits of the same city or town. As a no-cost move, a
member can be moved between units at the same base, or between bases or addresses when both bases or
addresses are within the corporate limits of the same city or town. Large metropolitan areas or large mil-
itary reservations are often comprised of a number of individual duty stations each having corporate city
limits or installation/base boundaries. When a change of duty station is being considered, it must be
determined if it will result in PCS entitlements accruing to the member. Moves where members accrue
PCS entitlements must be requested by an activity authorized to request PCS moves and approved by the
assignment OPR (also see paragraph 2.51. for low-cost moves). (NOTE: No-cost (no entitlement) moves
do not include permissive PCS, see Attachment 10. A permissive PCS, while referred to and made at
“no cost” to the government, differs from a PCS for which there are no PCS entitlements. Although PCS
entitlements accrue for a permissive PCS, the member agrees not to claim them but to pay all PCS
expenses in exchange for this special assignment consideration.)
   2.50.1. In some cases it may be desirable to use some of the PCS procedures in managing no-cost
   moves. To project manning requirements, when there is a change in MAJCOM or for other reasons,
   an assignment action number (AAN) and projection of the assignment in the PDS may be appropriate.
   It may also be desirable to use PCS orders to record some no-cost moves, such as those from one base
   to another. When PCS orders are issued, include this statement in the remarks section: "This is a
   no-cost move. No PCS entitlements authorized. Date departed last duty station (DDLDS) and date
   arrived station (DAS) will not change." The PCS Cost Identifier Code will be "M," Reassignment
   Without Fund Allocation.
   2.50.2. Sometimes in connection with a no-cost move, there may be a requirement for the member to
   vacate government quarters. For example, if a member resides in government quarters at their current
   duty location, but is not authorized to remain in those quarters upon assignment to another location.
   When no PCS entitlements exist but relocation of residence is required, then the move and dislocation
   allowance are funded with O&M funds using "local move" procedures outlined in the JFTR.

2.51. Low-Cost PCS. Low-cost moves are PCSs between duty locations in proximity (daily commute is
common by the civilian public between either location and member's current residence) and it is deter-
mined in advance of approval of the PCS that there will be no requirement for the member to relocate
their household in conjunction with the PCS being considered. The fact that an individual could be
moved under low-cost PCS provisions will not be the primary consideration in the assignment selection
process. A member is still considered for PCS based upon qualifications, eligibility for PCS, and assign-
ment selection priorities. One consideration for low-cost PCSs should be will an additional funded PCS
be required to backfill. Another consideration is how vulnerable the member is for subsequent reassign-
ment (i.e., OS tour history and/or TOS) given that the DDLDS and DAS do not change as a result of a
low-cost PCS. Furthermore, the assignment OPR, in conjunction with the gaining commander, must
weigh whether or not the member will likely remain in the position long enough to become productive
and proficient.
   2.51.1. PCS entitlements accrue to members whenever they are assigned between permanent duty
   stations which are not within the corporate limits of the same city or town, or between stations, reser-
   vations, or established areas having defined boundaries. NOTE: Designating metropolitan areas
   which are in many instances comprised of individual cities/towns as one duty station for the pur-
   pose of PCS entitlements, called “clustering”, is prohibited by Comptroller General decision.
104                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      Accordingly, when members accrue PCS entitlements, they cannot be reassigned under no-cost (no
      entitlement) provisions. The fact that a member’s servicing MPF, parent unit, or commander will not
      change has no bearing on accrual of PCS entitlements. PCS entitlements accrue based on the relation-
      ship of the duty stations and not where a member resides. However, if relocation of household is
      required and authorized, it does affect whether or not a move can be made under low-cost PCS provi-
      sions. A low-cost PCS between permanent duty stations in proximity may be considered if all of the
      following criteria are met:
         2.51.1.1. Before the PCS can be approved, the member must provide a written statement to the
         assignment OPR certifying he or she will not relocate his or her household as a result of PCS. The
         member’s certification must include the commuting distance and time from current residence to
         present duty station, and the expected commuting distance and time from current residence to the
         new duty station. The fact a member does not intend to relocate their household or does not
         intend to claim reimbursement for PCS entitlements will not be the primary basis or sole
         justification for approval of a low-cost PCS. The assignment OPR must coordinate proposed
         low-cost PCSs with HQ AFPC/DPAPP3 in advance of approval and provide the required state-
         ment.
         2.51.1.2. The total cost of all PCS entitlements will not exceed $500.00 (considering mileage
         allowance, travel, per diem, shipment of unaccompanied baggage, HHGs, dislocation allowance,
         temporary lodging, etc.). Whether or not the member intends to claim reimbursement for the PCS
         or does not intend to claim reimbursement for PCS costs exceeding $500.00 is not a factor. If a
         member resides in government quarters at their current duty location, but is not authorized
         to remain in those quarters upon assignment to a duty location in proximity, then the
         requirement to vacate quarters precludes the PCS being effected as a low-cost PCS. The fol-
         lowing applies:
             2.51.1.2.1. Before making any commitments, members should request counseling based on
             their specific circumstances and JFTR entitlements associated with moves between locations
             in proximity.
             2.51.1.2.2. All normal PCS eligibility and selection policies and procedures apply, except
             there is no minimum TOS requirement and no PCS retainability requirement.
             2.51.1.2.3. Member will not incur a PCS ADSC.
             2.51.1.2.4. Low-cost PCS will be considered only for CONUS to CONUS and OS to OS PCS
             when the duty stations are in proximity as described in paragraph 2.51.
             2.51.1.2.5. Curtailment of OS tour is not authorized, original tour completion date will be
             retained and members are not authorized COT leave/travel entitlements.
             2.51.1.2.6. No en route training or TDY will be authorized in conjunction with a low-cost
             PCS.
             2.51.1.2.7. The PCS Cost Identifier Code for a low-cost PCS will be “V”, PCS Moves w/
             Expenditures Less Than $500.00.
             2.51.1.2.8. The member’s DDLDS/DAS will not be changed in conjunction with a low-cost
             PCS. In the event the DDLDS/DAS changes in the PDS as a result of processing the mem-
             ber’s PCS travel voucher, then the MPF must restore the previous DDLDS/DAS.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                105


   2.51.2. PCS moves originally approved using normal TOS, retainability, ADSC criteria, and so on,
   which could have been made under low-cost provisions but were not approved in advance as low-cost
   moves will not be changed after the fact, nor will PCS orders be amended later to show the PCS was
   made under low-cost provisions. For example, a member selected for PCS who met the minimum
   TOS, had or acquired retainability, accepted the PCS ADSC, had DDLDS/DAS changed upon PCS,
   etc., but who did not relocate his or her household incident to PCS, may not subsequently have that
   PCS changed (DDLDS/DAS restored, ADSC removed, etc.) to reflect the PCS was made under
   low-cost move provisions. Conversely, PCS moves originally approved as low-cost PCSs will not be
   changed to fully funded moves without full justification and approval by HQ AFPC/DPAPP3. Justifi-
   cation must clearly show that the member was miscounseled or that the orders were unclear, incom-
   plete, or invalid.

2.52. Second PCS and Second Dislocation Allowance (DLA) Entitlement, Same Fiscal Year (FY).
This paragraph applies to all members regardless of marital or dependent status and is to be used in con-
junction with the JFTR which governs the entitlement to, and payment of, DLA. Except as authorized
below, only one PCS involving DLA entitlement is authorized in a FY unless the SAF determines the
needs of the AF require an additional PCS. Approval for a second PCS (or more) in the same FY and
approval of a second DLA entitlement (or more) involves two separate considerations: one is TOS; and
the other is whether or not the PCS involves entitlement to DLA and requires a Secretarial determination.
As explained below, depending on the reason for PCS, a member may not be entitled to DLA, or an addi-
tional DLA entitlement in the same FY may be excluded from the FY DLA count. Whether a member
does not use a DLA entitlement (actual movement of dependents is not a prerequisite to DLA entitlement
in the case of members with dependents), or does not intend to claim reimbursement for movement of
dependents are not factors in the requirement to obtain a Secretarial determination. For example, for a
permissive PCS, a member accrues PCS entitlements (including DLA) but agrees in advance not to use
PCS entitlements; however, a Secretarial determination for a second entitlement in the same FY is still
required. Neither the member nor the AF can waive a DLA entitlement. Further, neither a change of end
assignment, diversion of a member en route, nor a TDY followed by PCS results in an entitlement for a
second DLA. However, for a continuation of PCS, see paragraph 2.52.6. which may entitle a member to
an additional DLA. The PDS will normally show when a member has had a PCS with DLA entitlement
in the current FY.
   2.52.1. Second PCS in Same FY. Table 2.3. shows the minimum TOS requirements for PCS. Based
   on TOS only, sometimes more than one PCS in the same FY may be permitted, but that in itself does
   not preclude the need for Secretarial approval of an additional DLA entitlement, unless there is no
   DLA entitlement for the PCS reason, or the entitlement may be excluded from the FY DLA count as
   explained below. When a waiver of the TOS minimum shown in Table 2.3. is required in addition to
   a request for second DLA entitlement, the waiver and second DLA requests will be combined. TOS
   waiver requests must be originated and processed according to paragraph 2.26. and paragraph 1.4.
   2.52.2. Second DLA Entitlement in Same FY. The date a member departs the last permanent duty
   station, whether TDY en route, delay en route, or direct, etc., determines the FY to which the DLA is
   charged. Members may not waive their DLA entitlement to avoid the requirement for a Secretarial
   determination. Requests for Secretarial determinations (DLA entitlement waiver) must be sent
   through the MAJCOM/DPA to the assignment OPR (see paragraph 2.26. and paragraph 1.4.). The
   assignment OPR will then forward as necessary for additional processing and approval. When a TOS
   waiver is required, the TOS waiver must be approved before the Secretarial determination is
106                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      requested. If the TOS waiver is disapproved, the Secretarial determination is not submitted and the
      requester is advised. Requests for Secretarial determinations should be submitted 90 calendar days
      before the member's scheduled PCS departure or as quickly as possible thereafter. Requests must
      include:
         2.52.2.1. Grade, name, SSN, and pertinent AFSC information.
         2.52.2.2. Proposed unit of assignment (if known).
         2.52.2.3. Full justification and proposed departure date. Ensure alternatives considered are
         addressed and why alternative action is not feasible. For example, why another member cannot be
         moved in the same grade and specialty who would not need a second DLA, or why a member can-
         not be used at a nearby base to possibly avoid the move of member's household.
         2.52.2.4. When an "after the fact" determination is requested, include reasons for not sending the
         request before the PCS.
         2.52.2.5. Departure date for each PCS during the current FY, if DLA was authorized, and if
         dependents relocated as a result of PCS. In the case of a member without dependents, indicate if
         the member was "assigned" government quarters as a result of PCS.
      2.52.3. When a request is approved, cite in PCS orders the document granting the Secretarial determi-
      nation and include the appropriate DLA category. Assignment instructions should include this infor-
      mation if not furnished to the MPF previously.
      2.52.4. As information, either members do not accrue entitlement to DLA in connection with PCS or
      the member is entitled to DLA but it is excluded from the fiscal year count, as follows (recommend
      confirmation by consulting the JFTR):
         2.52.4.1. Upon PCS to first duty station upon entry on active duty (does not preclude payment of
         trailer allowance).
         2.52.4.2. Upon separation or retirement.
         2.52.4.3. For no-cost/no entitlement PCS moves as explained in paragraph 2.50.
         2.52.4.4. When a member, with or without dependents, who is not entitled to transportation of
         dependents at government expense, is assigned to government quarters at the new permanent duty
         station.
         2.52.4.5. Between bases in an OS area where dependents are not authorized and member will be
         assigned to government quarters at the new base.
      2.52.5. To, from, or between schools (must be 20 weeks or more in duration) conducted at a military
      base or conducted, controlled, and managed by a Uniformed Service at a civilian education institution
      or elsewhere. NOTE: Members do have a DLA entitlement, but the entitlement is excluded from
      DLA computation.
      2.52.6. In very limited circumstances, a continuation of PCS (see paragraph 2.35.3.) may result in an
      additional DLA entitlement; however, the entitlement is excluded from second DLA computation.
      For reimbursement of an additional DLA, members must have actually established a household at the
      original gaining duty station and must actually relocate that household again as a result of the contin-
      uation of PCS.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    107


2.53. Peace Corps, Assignment of Former Members of the. Former members of the Peace Corps are
not assigned permanent or temporary duty in the military intelligence field for a period of 4 years follow-
ing service with the Peace Corps. Members who later acquire an intelligence specialty are not assigned in
an intelligence capacity to any foreign country in which they previously served as Peace Corps members.
This limitation on the use of former Peace Corps members will not be waived.
   2.53.1. The term "former members of the Peace Corps" includes former Peace Corps volunteers, vol-
   unteer leaders, and staff members of the Peace Corps. The term does not include persons who
   attended Peace Corps training but never went OS with the Peace Corps. These persons are restricted
   from being assigned duties in an intelligence capacity only to foreign countries for which they
   received Peace Corps training.
   2.53.2. ALC "R" identifies former members of the Peace Corps. See Table 2.2.

2.54. Security Access Requirements for PCS. AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management,
is the prescribing instruction for the AF Personnel Security Program and takes precedence in the event of
a conflict with this instruction regarding personnel security access or individual security investigation
processing. A PCS may require a member have access to a higher level of classified information. Each
PCS selection will specify the level of security access for that assignment. Members should have at least
12 months service retainability remaining from the date of assignment to a position requiring SCI access
unless they are already SCI access eligible or have a current favorable SBI. Normally the investigation
requester is the base Security Forces function serving the member's current unit, except when assignment
instructions or AFI 31-501 stipulate some other activity will be the requester.
   2.54.1. The PDS transaction, assignment trailer remarks, a Personnel Processing Code (PPC) or mes-
   sage will advise the losing MPF and commander of the security access requirement for the assign-
   ment.
   2.54.2. Losing commanders ensure unit procedures exist so that assignment selections are expedi-
   tiously reviewed to determine if an individual security investigation, reinvestigation, or other action is
   required. The unit provides the member administrative support. The unit commander and security
   manager (or other unit official designated by the commander) ensure the member reports to the local
   Security Forces for quality review of security documents (usually within 10 days of PCS notification),
   and that completed personnel security forms are given to the Security Forces (usually not more than
   30 days after PCS notification) or according to locally established procedures.
   2.54.3. When the commander identifies circumstances as outlined in AFI 31-501 that preclude a
   favorable recommendation for access or submission or update of an investigation, the MPF will rec-
   lama to the assignment OPR (see paragraph 2.47.) and explain the circumstances.
   2.54.4. The MPF will include security data in the PCS orders as shown in AFI 37-128, Administrative
   Orders.
   2.54.5. The MPF may publish PCS orders and allow members to depart on PCS without a security
   determination in the following instances:
       2.54.5.1. For mandatory PCS moves (see Attachment 1), or
       2.54.5.2. Access required is top secret or lower, or
       2.54.5.3. For SCI access, if the assignment OPR or gaining MAJCOM/DPA (or equivalent)
       authorizes issuance of PCS orders in accordance with the criteria in paragraph 2.54.6.
108                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      2.54.6. The gaining MAJCOM (usually assignments) must monitor assignments requiring SCI access
      and obtain the status of SCI eligibility from the MAJCOM Special Security Office (SSO). As soon as
      determined, but not later than 90 calendar days before RNLTD, the gaining MAJCOM (DPA or SSO)
      advises the losing MPF whether member is eligible for SCI access. As an exception, the gaining
      MAJCOM/DPA (or equivalent), or the assignment OPR may approve departure of a member without
      an SCI eligibility determination. The decision to permit a member to proceed without an SCI eligibil-
      ity determination is based on whether or not the member can be effectively used within the gaining
      unit permanently in a manpower position that does not require SCI access. If an SCI eligibility deter-
      mination cannot be made or an exception approved 90 calendar days prior to RNLTD, then the gaining
      MAJCOM/DPA (or equivalent) must request the assignment OPR, with information to the losing
      MPF, unit, and gaining MPF and unit, to:
         2.54.6.1. Delay the RNLTD, or
         2.54.6.2. Change the end assignment (with or without change of RNLTD), or
         2.54.6.3. Cancel the assignment. If cancellation is requested, justification must be provided to the
         assignment OPR and include action taken to terminate any pending investigation or reinvestiga-
         tion or why termination is not appropriate.
      2.54.7. Graduates of technical training schools selected for assignments requiring SCI access may
      proceed to the new unit upon graduation without a completed investigation if recommended for SCI
      access by their commander according to AFI 31-501 and when they have a "1" under "S" in the PUL-
      HES profile. HQ 497 IG/INS, Andrews AFB, MD is responsible for determining SCI eligibility for
      all students attending technical training schools.
      2.54.8. Airman Basic Training Graduates. The base personnel processing group does the tasks
      required by the authorized investigation requester. If the airman is deemed acceptable by the 319
      TRS, Lackland AFB, TX for SCI, then the airman may be assigned to the appropriate AF Military
      Training Center.

2.55. PCS Orders. PCS orders are issued in accordance with AFI 37-128, Administrative Orders.
      2.55.1. MPFs may publish PCS orders only after receipt of written assignment instructions via the
      PDS or a message from the assignment OPR directing a PCS or approving a PCS request.
      2.55.2. An MPF may not amend, revoke, or rescind PCS orders issued by another MPF unless specif-
      ically authorized by the assignment OPR or other appropriate authority at HQ USAF or HQ AFPC.
      2.55.3. See paragraph 2.33. for orders in hand requirements.

2.56. Assignment Action Number (AAN). The assignment action number (AAN) is used by the assign-
ment OPR to control assignments and for other purposes. Budget managers use the AAN for budget pur-
poses and to determine the fiscal year (FY) to which a PCS will be charged based on the Transfer
Effective Date (TED). The TED is the month and year of the AAN and corresponds to the original
requirement month. The TED (and FY to which a PCS will be charged) can only be changed by cancel-
lation of the AAN and issuance of a new AAN. A change in PDD or RNLTD will not change the FY to
which a PCS is charged. DLA is charged to the FY in which the member departs on PCS (see paragraph
2.52.).
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    109


   2.56.1. AANs are necessary only for those permanent changes of (duty) station and intercommand
   permanent changes of (duty) assignments (without PCS) prescribed by this instruction. The AAN is
   determined at the time an allocation to fill a manning requirement is made, or at the time a name is
   applied to a manning requirement. PCS moves which are not made under the authority of this instruc-
   tion (see paragraph 1.1.1. and Attachment 22) do not require an AAN and/or do not use the number-
   ing system described below.
   2.56.2. The AAN construction is similar for officers and airmen. It consists of 10 alphanumeric posi-
   tions as follows:


Position Description                                                     Example
1-2      Requirement month (the month in which a requirement             "09" is September
         exists, regardless of when a member actually departs or
         arrives)
3        Calendar year of the requirement (last digit only)              "8" is 1998
4-5      Level of command initiating the assignment (see note 1.)        "0N" is HQ USAF and HQ
                                                                         AFPC (see note 1.)
6-10       Assignment sequence number (see note 2.)                      12345 (or S1234) (see note 2.)

NOTES:
  1. For officers, the initiating level will always be "0N." For airmen, the command identified code of
     the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA initiating the assignment request is used when the initiator is other than
     HQ AFPC.
   2. The first position of the five position sequence number (position 6) may be alpha and can be used
      to further identify sub-groupings of assignments. Activities authorized to initiate assignment
      requests may not use a letter in position 6 of the sequence number without prior approval of HQ
      AFPC/DPAPP for officers, and HQ AFPC/DPAAS for airmen. Some commonly used letters are:
         "G" for generals, including brigadier general selects.
         "X" for colonels, including selects.
         "S" for airmen for certain computer matched assignments.

2.57. Air Travel of Air Force Personnel. Air transportation is the primary mode of travel for movement
of AF military personnel to, from, and between OS areas. The inability of a member to accept this con-
cept is considered incompatible with an AF career. A member who cannot travel by air is promptly
referred to his or her servicing medical treatment facility for evaluation by a medical board. If the inabil-
ity to travel by air is due to a physical disability then referral to a PEB is mandatory. If the reason the
member cannot travel by air is for any reason other than physical disability, the medical board refers the
case to the appropriate commander for administrative separation action.

2.58. Enlisted Aircrew Assignments. Airmen who are career aviators are selected and reassigned in
their aircrew AFSC only. Career aviators are those AFSCs that require aviation service as a mandatory
specialty qualification according to AFMAN 36-2108, Airman Classification; AFI 11-401, Flight Man-
agement; and AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges. Career
110                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


aviators are those aircrew members who perform full time aircrew duties in AFSCs 1AXXX, or SDI
8A000 or 8S100. Career aviators are authorized award of an X, K, or Q prefix.

2.59. Enlisted Noncareer Aviators and Operational Support Flyers. Enlisted noncareer aviators are
airmen in career fields other than the Airman Aircrew Operations career field (AFSC 1AXXX) whose
AFSC is authorized the award of an X, K, or Q prefix in accordance with AFMAN 36-2108, and whose
AFSC is included as authorized crew compliment in AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost and Planning Fac-
tors, attachment 39-1, Authorized Crew Composition - Active Forces. Noncareer aviators qualify for avi-
ation service in accordance with AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-402. Operational Support Flyers are not part of
the authorized aircrew compliment identified in AFI 65-503, and do not qualify for aviation service in
accordance with AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-402. Operational Support Flyers must be medically qualified in
accordance with AFMAN 48-123, and complete physiological training before flying. Noncareer aviators
and operational support flyers may be reassigned to non-flying duties if it is in the best interest of the AF
and if they are told of removal from flying duties at least 120 calendar days in advance. In those cases
where assignment instructions are received that do not give 120 days notice of removal from flying status,
the MPF will reclama the assignment according to paragraph 2.47. The 120 calendar days notice of invol-
untary removal from flying status can be waived by the airman to accept the assignment.
NOTE:
The basis for the AF aviation service program is public law. In accordance with AFI 11-402, enlisted per-
sonnel must volunteer to enter training that will qualify them to perform in-flight duties as aircrew mem-
bers (career and noncareer) or operational support flyers. Unless permanently disqualified under the
provisions of AFI 11-402, members who complete initial training remain available for flying duties and
may be directed to perform such duties at any time.
      2.59.1. Aircrew Evaluation Board (AEB). When an AEB is to be convened on an airman who has
      been selected for PCS, the convening authority will ensure HQ AFPC/DPAOY is advised. When a
      member is TDY (either TDY en route PCS, or TDY and return with PCS afterwards) HQ AFPC/
      DPAOY will determine disposition of the member and direct appropriate action.
      2.59.2. To volunteer for flying duties as a noncareer aviator or operational support flyer, airmen use
      the AF Form 392, Airman Assignment Preference Statement. In Section III, include the statement:
      "I am a volunteer for flying duty" and require the airman to initial the statement. The MPF updates the
      code for airborne support aircrew (formerly operational support aircrew duty) per PDS table 240
      along with the appropriate assignment preference codes.
      2.59.3. Nonvolunteers Selected or Nominated for Flying Duty. There is a continuing need for airmen
      to perform flying duties to meet worldwide commitments. It is not always possible to meet these
      requirements from eligible airmen who have volunteered. Sometimes airmen are selected or nomi-
      nated for assignment and their volunteer status determined afterwards. Except under those emergency
      conditions outlined in AFI 11-401, airmen will not be required to perform flying duties involuntarily.
      Airmen who decline to volunteer upon selection or nomination for flying status duty will be placed in
      ALC "N" (see Table 2.2.), and a reclama submitted per paragraph 2.47. There is no specified format
      for the declination statement, but declination must be in writing. After update of the ALC, the state-
      ment may be destroyed as a transitory document. The ALC remains until it expires or is removed
      when airmen desire to volunteer for flying duty. The ALC may be repeated, if after expiration airmen
      are again selected or nominated for flying status duty and decline to volunteer. Declination to volun-
      teer for flying status duty is without prejudice.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  111


   2.59.4. On receipt of an assignment levy with the prefix "X" on the projected CAFSC, when required
   by a PPC, for example, PPC "9JB," or a nomination to flying duty, the MPF will arrange for comple-
   tion of a Class III flying physical, and schedule initial physiological training within 30 calendar days
   of PCS notification or nomination. Schedule only airmen who are volunteers for flying duty unless
   otherwise directed.
   2.59.5. When an airman is not medically qualified for flying duty per AF Form 422 (or other corre-
   spondence from medical authorities such as AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying
   or Special Operational Duty), the MPF will reclama the assignment or request release from nomina-
   tion and place the airman in ALC "N" per Table 2.2.. The ALC may be repeated if, after expiration,
   the airman is again selected and again found not medically qualified. If the specific medical condition
   requires update of another AAC or ALC that limits assignment selection, then update of ALC "N" is
   not required.

2.60. (Airmen Only) High Year of Tenure (HYT). Reenlistment or extension of enlistment beyond the
limits established in AFI 36-3202 are not authorized except for documented cases of extreme personal
hardship. Waivers are requested according to AFI 36-3203.

2.61. Officer Mandatory Utilization Requirement. A mandatory utilization requirement (formerly
called Directed Duty Assignment [DDA]) is a tool to ensure assignment of an officer in a utilization field
(AF specialty) for a prescribed period consistent with AF funded training or education received, or other
reasons as shown in Table 2.10. A mandatory utilization requirement is separate from an ADSC or the
requirement to be assigned to a manpower position which requires an Advance Academic Degree (AAD,
see paragraph 2.42.). An officer may begin to satisfy an ADSC associated with training immediately
upon graduation, but the mandatory utilization requirement is not satisfied until an officer is assigned in
the mandatory utilization AFS for the period prescribed, or an exception to the utilization requirement is
approved. Activities which have mandatory utilization requirements approved by HQ AFPC/DPA will
ensure the MPFs servicing their function are advised to include the mandatory utilization requirement in
PCS orders; certificate of completion; or other similar source documents. They should also update the
Mandatory Utilization AFS (first three positions of the AFSC in which accessed, trained, in which educa-
tion was received, etc.) and expiration date. MPFs will establish procedures to ensure the above require-
ments are completed when officers graduate, complete training, and so on. The assignment OPR,
MAJCOM/DPA, MPFs, and unit commanders are responsible for ensuring an officer's utilization com-
plies with mandatory utilization requirements. Exception requests to assign officers out of their manda-
tory utilization specialty (locally or in conjunction with PCS) are submitted in advance of the requested
assignment through the unit commander. Unit commanders may disapprove exception requests or recom-
mend approval and forward to the servicing MPF. MPFs will review and make a recommendation of
approval or disapproval and forward to the member's MAJCOM/DPA. MAJCOM/DPA may disapprove
a request or recommend approval and forward it to the assignment OPR for the officer's mandatory utili-
zation AFS. Exception requests may be submitted requesting to defer utilization or release the officer
from the utilization requirement. Requests must contain justification which shows how the requested uti-
lization is in the overall long term best interests of the AF versus temporary local requirements or an
officer's personal desires. Exception requests may be disapproved by the assignment OPR, or when
approval is recommended, forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAPP2 which may approve or forward as necessary
for approval/disapproval to the AF OPR which established the mandatory utilization requirement. HQ
AFPC/DPA is the exception authority for the mandatory utilization requirement in conjunction with
AFIT-sponsored AAD assignments. The requester will be advised of approval or disapproval. The fol-

tion requirement for application or selection:

      2.61.3. Undergraduate flying training.
      2.61.4. Operation Bootstrap.

2.62. Personnel Processing Codes (PPCs). Codes included in assignment instructions which refer to
PCS-related processing requirements or post-selection assignment actions. The literal translation of a
PPC is in the base level ZEUS file. To access the files, input the following CAT file strings: 09YC0V4/
PPC_OFF or 09YCOV4/PPC_AMN. MAJCOMs request establishment of PPCs from HQ AFPC/
DPSFM. HQ AFPC/DPSFM will coordinate those requests for PPCs which involve assignment policies
or procedures.

2.63. Assignment of Airmen to Deployable Units or Duty Requiring Frequent TDY.
      2.63.1. A number of AF units and duty assignments are subject to frequent deployment or an unusual
      amount of TDY (120 or more calendar days per year). Consecutive assignments to such units or
      assignment of airmen upon completion of an unaccompanied short tour to one of these units can result
      in hardships not usually experienced by AF members. Should an airman receive an assignment which
      is not consistent with this policy, he or she may request not to be assigned to that particular unit and,
      consistent with mission requirements, every effort will be made to accommodate the member’s
      request. In some cases there may not be other resources available to meet requirements and then the
      needs of the AF must be given primary consideration. This provision does not apply to assignment
      from a CONUS high TDY unit to an OS unaccompanied short tour (including if the OS unit is a high
      TDY unit). This is because of the need to distribute OS assignments as equitably as possible, espe-
      cially unaccompanied tours and since the OS tour is unaccompanied, the period of family separation
      would not be made greater as a result of frequent TDY. This provision also does not apply to enlisted
      aircrew assignments.
      2.63.2. MAJCOMs with units or duty assignments requiring members perform 120 calendar days or
      more TDY per year may apply PPC “9TD” to all projected assignments (including no-name alloca-
      tions). The PPC may be entered for specific grades/AFSCs when the likelihood of frequent TDY
      exists. Frequency is usually based on the rate of TDY experienced by the majority of currently
      assigned members in a grade/AFSC during the preceding 2-year period.
      2.63.3. Requests will be forwarded through a member’s unit commander. The request will contain
      the member’s name, grade, SSN, CAFSC and additional AFSCs (if any), AAN, RNLTD, gaining unit
      and alternate preferences List only those locations within the current gaining MAJCOM. Do not list
      locations which belong to a MAJCOM other than the MAJCOM to which the airman is presently pro-
      jected for assignment. The commander may disapprove a request if it does not meet the criteria for
      approval. The commander will forward requests recommended for approval to the servicing MPF for
      forwarding to the gaining MAJCOM/DPAA. For members who are not completing an unaccompa-
      nied short tour, the request must contain a summary of the member’s TDY during the preceding 2 year
      period for the commander’s certification. The gaining MAJCOM will make a determination and
      either request a change from the assignment OPR or advise the member why a change is not possible

NOTES:


  1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 2.15.
     a. See the Stabilized Tour Guide for a list of organizations authorized stabilized tours (organiza-
     tional deferment), the length of the tour (deferment), and if the tour is designated a minimum or
     maximum tour.
     b. An AAC does not preclude a mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1 for definition of mandatory
     PCS), unless note 8 is indicated for that code.
  2. Do not update for members assigned OS.
  3. Member is not eligible to apply for the following self-initiated assignment programs until the
     deferment has expired: join-spouse, non-CONUS resident, to or from CONUS-isolated tour,
     CONUS assignment exchange, expanded permissive, COT, COT follow-on (see paragraph
     2.40.3.13.), and (airmen only) BOP, and VSBAP. A member who had an action approved under
     one of these programs before being placed in a code making them ineligible may retain the previ-
     ously approved action if expiration of the ineligibility condition is before the departure date/
     DEROS. An RNLTD will not be changed for the sole purpose of allowing a member's deferment
     to expire before the departure date/DEROS.
  4. Does not apply to CMSgts. Do not update unless specifically authorized by HQ AFPC/DPAC.
  5. If the airman refuses to obtain retainability to fulfill the CDA commitment or ADSC for directed
     training with a PCS, then the MPF reclamas the assignment.
  6. As determined by AFI 51-703, Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction: Policies and Procedures.
  7. Do not involuntarily extend member's DEROS. Retain member in place, but allow DEROS to
     expire (unless a voluntary DEROS extension is requested and approved).
  8. Includes mandatory PCS.
  9. Civil Court deferment is only to appear as a witness on behalf of any party in connection with
     judicial proceedings to which the United States is a party (includes hospital recovery claims).
  10. Advise the assignment OPR with information addressee of HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 when placing the
      member in this code and PCS is mandatory.
  11. Requires assignment OPR approval prior to update of this code on an individual. The assignment
      action reason (AAR) for a PCS or other similar approval (such as a letter/memo, assignment
      trailer remarks, approved application, PCS orders, and so on) may be used by MPFs as authority
      for update of an AAC.
  12. Although every effort is made to ensure completion of the 2-year deferment, the deferment may
      end before the scheduled date in order to meet manning needs having a higher priority. HQ AFPC/

NOTES:
  1. For pregnancy, see paragraph 2.39. and AAC 81, Table 2.1. For adoption, see paragraph 2.19.
      2. Airman is not eligible to apply for the following self-initiated assignment programs: join-spouse,
         base of preference, to or from CONUS-isolated tour, VSBAP, CONUS assignment exchange,
         expanded permissive, COT, or COT follow-on (see paragraph 2.40.3.13.).
      3. Includes Enlistment Bonus (EB), Broken Service Selective Reenlistment Bonus (BSSRB), or
         Selective Reenlistment Bonus (SRB).
      4. MPFs update ALC “Q” only when instructed to do so by HQ AFPC/DPAPO or upon written con-
         firmation from the base Special Needs Coordinator that a member has a family member who
         meets DoD enrollment criteria for the EFMP. Delete the “Q” code only when instructed to do so
         by HQ AFPC/DPAPO or upon written confirmation from the base Special Needs Coordinator that
         the special needs no longer exist.
      5. A first-term airman, selected as a volunteer for an extended long OS tour can delay obtaining
         retainability for a portion of the extended OS tour until after arrival OS. See paragraph 2.29. and
         Table 2.7. for details. The losing MPF will input ALC 8 for approved delays with expiration date
         of the projected tour completion date for the full extended tour. The gaining OS MPF will verify
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                       143

   is based on the specific reason for PCS shown in column A, and not on the fact a member is a noncareer officer or FTA.
3. May be used only when the reason for surplus is one of those reasons listed in paragraph 2.48. If a member is surplus for a reason other
   than those listed, then an exception must be requested according to paragraph 1.5. (to include a waiver of TOS). Also see rule 24.
4. Members accompanied by dependents require 24 months TOS before PCS. Single or unaccompanied people require 15 months TOS
   before PCS. These are minimum requirements; people may remain assigned longer.
5. Applies only to members disqualified for duty due to loss of AFSC, security clearance or access to SCI, professional certification,
   nuclear certification or medical qualification, or relief from duty for cause and where no vacant position exists at the same duty station
   in which members may serve pending requalification.

NOTE: For students, the RNLTD shown in member's PCS orders may be earlier (but not later) than the
RNLTD shown in the PDS. The RNLTD in the orders is the graduation date plus actual number of days
leave desired plus travel time. A formal change of RNLTD shown in the PDS to agree with the orders is
not required. When the PCS is OS, the member’s port call will not be earlier than the RNLTD month
shown in PCS orders, but may be earlier than the RNLTD reflected in the PDS. Under such circum-
stances, reporting OS prior to the RNLTD month shown in the PDS will not result in a Category 1 PCS
Processing Discrepancy.

NOTES:
  1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 2.29. When PCS is to an OS location, see Table 2.6.
      2. Certain assignments require service retainability greater than the minimum. When applicable,
         assignment OPRs state the retainability required in assignment remarks, additional assignment
         instructions, or a PPC.
      3. When the member is ineligible to obtain 12 months retainability (for example, an officer has an
         established DOS or retirement date, an airmen is HYT restricted, or is ineligible due to quality
         control or some other reason) or declines to obtain the retainability (for example, an airman signs
         a declination statement, or an officer elects to 7-day opt or when serving on an SPTC declines to
         do an additional SPTC), the DEROS is extended to equal the DOS/retirement date. Normally this
         involuntary OS tour extension will be accomplished automatically by the PDS.
      4. When a member is ineligible or declines to obtain 12 months retainability (see note 3 above), and
         has less than 7 months from DEROS to DOS/retirement date, the DEROS is extended to equal
         DOS/retirement date. When a member who is ineligible or declines to obtain 12 months retain-
         ability has at least 7 months from DEROS to DOS, assignment OPRs provide an assignment (as
         an exception to the requirement that members have 12 months service retainability).
      5. A member eligible to obtain 12 months retainability must do so. Members may not extend or
         agree to obligated service just long enough to qualify for the 7 month retainability exception in
         note 4. For example: An officer with an indefinite DOS will incur a 12 month ADSC upon PCS.
         He/she may not agree to incur only a 7 month PCS ADSC. An airman eligible to extend to meet
         the full 12 month retainability requirement must do so. He/she cannot extend just enough to be
         eligible for the 7 month exception.
      6. A member who cannot obtain the full 12 months retainability, but can obtain at least 7 (or more)
         months retainability, must obtain the maximum retainability for which they are eligible before
         they can receive an assignment under the 7 month retainability exception. For example: An air-
         man with 5 months service retainability from DEROS to DOS who is eligible to extend for only
         an additional 5 months (their maximum allowable), must extend the full 5 months (total 10
         months retainability), or decline in writing. The airman will not be permitted to extend just 2
         months to be eligible for PCS under the 7 month retainability exception.

NOTES:
  1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 2.29. and Table 2.5.
      2.       Assignment OPRs will obtain waivers of this requirement from HQ AFPC/DPA for Lt Cols and
             below or from AFCMO for colonel and selectees.
      3.       For officers, as an exception, select a volunteer if he or she provides a written statement indicat-
             ing understanding that their DEROS will be involuntarily extended to match their mandatory

       DOS or mandatory retirement date. In this case, they will separate or retire upon completion of
       the involuntarily extended OS tour.
  4.      Career airmen, regardless of volunteer status, are ineligible for PCS selection if upon comple-
       tion of an unaccompanied short tour, they will be subject to involuntary DEROS extension due to
       HYT restriction. HQ AFPC/DPA is the waiver authority for PCS selection.
  5. Career airmen, regardless of volunteer status, marital status or whether or not the airman has
     dependents, must have or be eligible to obtain retainability indicated to be eligible for selection.
     HQ AFPC/DPA is the waiver authority. The intent of a retainability requirement beyond comple-
     tion of the unaccompanied OS tour length is:
     either to ensure the member can obtain the required retainability to receive a CONUS PCS after
     an unaccompanied OS tour and preclude involuntary extension of an unaccompanied tour due to
     lack of PCS retainability, or to ensure adequate retainability to allow election of an accompanied
     tour. The retainability requirement beyond tour completion is not intended to preclude an invol-
     untary DEROS extension due to lack of PCS retainability for members who are serving an accom-
     panied tour. The accompanied tour length is not always 12 months more than the unaccompanied
     tour (e.g. 24/15 month tours), so eligibility for selection uses the accompanied tour length for 24/
     12 tours, OR the unaccompanied tour length plus 12 months for 24/15 tours. For example, for a
     24/15 tour, the accompanied tour is 9 months longer than the unaccompanied tour, but CONUS
     PCS retainability required is 12 months. Therefore, in order to be eligible for selection without
     knowing which tour a person will elect, they must have or be able to obtain 27 months total retain-
     ability.
  6.    Career airmen, regardless of volunteer status, marital status or whether or not the airman has
       dependents, must have or be eligible to obtain retainability indicated to be eligible for selection.
       HQ AFPC/DPA is the waiver authority.
  7.     Consider a first-term airman with an approved Career Job Reservation (CJR) as a career airman
       for retainability for OS PCS selection.
  8.    Initial ETS is the completion of the member's initial enlistment with no extensions.
  9.     HQ AFPC/DPA must approve selection for PCS of an airman when, upon completion of an
       unaccompanied OS short tour the airman would have less than 7 months PCS retainability.

NOTES:
  1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 2.29.6.8.
      2.    Do not grant a delay:
           a. Beyond the date an airman desires to use entitlements;
           b. For airmen permanently ineligible to obtain full retainability;
           c. For circumstances not shown above (for example, airmen who are HYT restricted, waiting for
              a CJR, etc.).
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                               155


  3. Airmen assigned OS must have or obtain at least 12 months retainability within 30 days of receipt
     of their DEROS Option and Forecast Notification RIP. Delays to this requirement will not be
     considered unless rule 1 or 7 applies (see notes 4 and 8). A delay may be granted in obtaining full
     COT or IPCOT retainability only for one of the reasons shown in the table.
  4. A delay may be granted to reduce SRB impact, but it may not be possible within the parameters
     authorized for delays to eliminate impact entirely. See AFI 36-2606 when assignment is in an
     additionally awarded SRB AFSC and the airman desires to reenlist in the SRB AFSC for PCS
     retainability.
  5. A delay for quality control reasons can only be granted if the airman already had an assignment
     prior to the quality control conditions.
  6. Airmen assigned OS must have or obtain at least 12 months retainability within 30 days of receipt
     of their DEROS Option and Forecast Notification RIP. Delays to this requirement will not be
     considered. Airmen must extend their enlistment the maximum of 23 months and either cannot
     reenlist in their present AFSC or desire to reenlist in their retraining AFSC (which is an SRB
     skill). For reenlistment at an en route TDY training site, the losing MPF Commander must obtain
     concurrence of the TDY station MPF Commander to reenlist the airman at the training site (last
     training site when there are more than one). Do not permit departure from the last training site
     without the full prescribed PCS retainability. If an airman does not reenlist upon completion of a
     training course, hold the airman at the training site and notify the assignment OPR responsible for
     the training into AFSC, HQ AFPC/DPAPP1, and the losing MPF within 3 calendar days after
     course completion and provide a report of the circumstances. Disposition instructions will be pro-
     vided by the assignment OPR within 5 calendar days.
  7. Grant first-term airman ineligible to reenlist because of insufficient time in service to request a
     CJR, a delay to obtain retainability for a portion of the ELT length. At the time of initial PCS
     notification, he or she must extend the maximum of 23 months and, having extended, must then
     have at least the required service retainability to serve the minimum prescribed DoD standard tour
     length (see Table 3.1.). The AF Form 899, Request and Authorization for Permanent Change of
     Station - Military, which directs reassignment of airmen selected under this program, must reflect
     both the correct total number of months the airman will serve as an extended long tour volunteer,
     and the fact that the airman was selected as an extended tour volunteer. For example, an airman
     selected as an extended long tour volunteer for reassignment to Ramstein, Germany, who elects
     the accompanied tour, is required to serve a total of 48 months. Even though Table 3.1. reflects a
     tour length of 36 months for an accompanied tour to Germany, the correct entry for item 11 (Tour
     length, total number of months) of the AF Form 899 is "48." In addition, item 12, (Extended long
     tour volunteer) should reflect an "X" each time the assignment action reason is "AO, extended
     long tour volunteer." This is important as the gaining MPF uses the AF Form 899 as the source
     document to award initial DEROS (standard (accompanied or unaccompanied) tour length plus
     12 months). Also include the following statement in item 24 (Remarks) of the AF Form 899
     "Approval granted to delay obtaining (indicate number) months service retainability for a portion
     of the extended (indicate accompanied or unaccompanied) tour according to AFI 36-2110, para-
     graph 2.29.11." Upon approval of the delay, the losing MPF updates ALC "8" with an expiration
     date equal to the projected tour completion date for the full prescribed tour. The gaining MPF
     verifies this update upon the airman's arrival and corrects as necessary. When the airman's DOS

         is updated as a result of reenlistment, the DEROS automatically changes to reflect the full pre-
         scribed extended tour length.
      8. Airman’s request for voluntary retirement should be submitted within 30 days of DEROS fore-
         cast. MPFs do not need to report delays approved under this rule as they will not purge until the
         airman is within 8 months of current DEROS. Once an airman has an ASD any retirement request
         must be submitted under 7-day option rules.

NOTES:
  1. This table must be used in conjunction with paragraphs 2.30. and 2.37. Besides PCS selection by
     the assignment OPR, this rule includes selection by the selection authority for training (whether or
     not listed in AFCAT 36-2223), or an education course, whether the member attends training or
     education course in PCS or TDY status (including TDY on the same base). AFGOMO/AFCMO
     or HQ AFPC/DPAPP may authorize the use of an ASD other than as shown (for example, a per-
     manent change of assignment (PCA) on the same station).
      2.    AFGOMO establishes the ASD for general officers (including brigadier general selectees), and
           AFCMO establishes the ASD for colonels (including colonel selectees).
      3.      For airmen retraining, the ASD is the date of the letter from HQ AFPC which approves or
           directs retraining.
      4.     When the ASD is based on a schedule (officers and airmen) or vulnerability for PCS selection
           (officers only), that is a member's official ASD for their next assignment. As of the ASD and
           thereafter, 7-day option provisions apply to the date of separation or retirement a member can
           request as described in paragraph 2.37., however, members are not required to apply for separa-
           tion or retirement within 7 days of being notified of the establishment of an ASD. The 7 day sus-
           pense requirement applies later when the member is officially notified of actual PCS selection
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 159


       with end location, RNLTD, and so on. When the ASD is established based on a schedule or vul-
       nerability for PCS selection, then the ASD which appears in an assignment transaction received
       through the PDS is the date the assignment OPR updated the PDS with the end assignment infor-
       mation. An automatic ASD is not established for an officer or airman based on scheduled com-
       pletion of a CONUS minimum stabilized tour.
  5.     For officers, the ASD is the date an officer is selected by name for assignment by the assignment
       OPR; OR the ASD is the date the assignment process begins in order to reassign an officer on a
       scheduled future date (such as upon DEROS, tour completion date from a CONUS maximum sta-
       bilized tour, the date a member will become surplus, and so on); OR, the date an officer is identi-
       fied by the assignment OPR as vulnerable for PCS selection.
  6.     The 7-day option period per paragraph 2.37. begins when officially notified of selection with
       end assignmentlocation and counseled on the ADSC incurred.
  7.     Airmen nominated do not have to exercise the 7-day option or decline to obtain service retain-
       ability until the assignment OPR determines them to be a firm selectee and they are officially
       notified of selection. After final selection of nominees, the ASDs of nominees not selected will
       be canceled.

NOTES:
  1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 2.37.; do not use this table alone to determine eligi-
     bility or effective dates and do not use Col F for separation or retirement dates members may
     request if they are serving OS or on a CONUS maximum stabilized tour. Also see paragraph
     2.29. and AFI 36-3203 for officer and airman retirements, and AFI 36-3207 for officer separa-
     tions.
   2. Establishment of an ASD is addressed in paragraph 2.30. and Table 2.8. During the time between
      establishment of an ASD and notification of actual PCS selection (with an end location, etc.), if a
      member requests separation or retirement, the request must be according to 7-day option provi-
      sions except it does not have to be submitted within 7 calendar days of being notified of establish-
      ment of an ASD.
   3. If a colonel or colonel selectee will not reach 20 years TAFMS as of the first day of the fourth
      month following event notification (mo/yr) the officer may request an exception to policy from
      AFCMO to permit retirement on a later date.
   4. When the expiration date of an officer’s longest ADSC is after the date they will reach 20 years
      TAFMS, then they may request a separation date not later than the last day of the month in which
      they complete their longest ADSC. For example, an officer with 18 years TAFMS at the time of
      PCS notificataion has an ADSC which expires in 3 years. Upon expiration of the ADSC the
      officer will have 21 years TAFMS. Establishing the DOS as the last day of the month will posi-
      tion the DOS so the officer can later request retirement for the first day of the month following
      their DOS.

                                                  Chapter 3

                                          OVERSEA (OS) DUTY

3.1. General Information. This chapter supplements the general policies and procedures prescribed
elsewhere in this instruction and contains guidance applicable to OS tour lengths, selection of members
for OS PCS, certain actions required as a result of OS PCS selection, management of personnel while
assigned OS, and actions in conjunction with OS tour completion.

3.2. OS Tour Lengths. OS tour lengths prescribed by DoD are normally based on quality of life condi-
tions with long tour locations usually comparing favorably to U.S. standards. Normally all members
assigned to a location serve the prescribed tour length, regardless of the military Service in which they
serve. However, there are exceptions and most of these are shown below or are listed by location in Table
3.1. Also, OS tour lengths members serve can be affected by choices members are authorized to make as
outlined elsewhere in this instruction (for example, as shown in Attachment 21). Members performing
duty at a permanent duty station which has a different tour length than that of their parent organization or
a different tour length than the location of the manpower authorization to which assigned (see paragraph
1.1.3. for additional guidance), will serve the tour length applicable to their permanent duty station. Per
Congressional guidance, the standard tour length for members stationed outside the CONUS shall be 36
months accompanied and 24 months unaccompanied (except for Alaska and Hawaii), unless the AF pro-
vides conclusive evidence to the DoD that tours at specific locations should be shorter because of the lack
of support facilities. If Table 3.1. does not specify a tour length for a location, the tour length (for assign-
ment planning purposes) is 36 months accompanied and 24 months unaccompanied. When a tour length
of less than 36/24 is requested, before selection of members for PCS, the tour length must be approved by
DoD according to paragraph 3.2.1. below, or by SAF when the guidance in paragraph 3.2.3. applies.
   3.2.1. Request to Establish or Change OS Tour Lengths. The DoD is the approval authority for estab-
   lishment of, or changes to, OS tour lengths, except those described in paragraph 3.2.3. Requests to
   establish a tour length or change to the DoD prescribed tour lengths reflected in Table 3.1. require the
   coordination of the Services affected and are submitted by the Unified Commander concerned,
   through the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and
   Readiness), for final decision. DoDD 1315.7 contains specific site survey data and other information
   required as justification for the requested tour length. Tour lengths based on factors other than quality
   of life conditions must be requested as an exception according to paragraph 3.2.2. and approved by
   DoD.
       3.2.1.1. Whenever possible, the effective date of a change of OS tour length should be far enough
       in advance (approximately 12 months or more) that the fewest number of members projected for
       assignment are affected, or a sufficient amount of time exists to cancel members selected for PCS
       and reselect, if appropriate, without undue hardship to members or waste of PCS funds. This is
       very important when the OS PCS selection criteria changes from long to short, or vice versa.
       Because of commitments to follow-on assignments, etc., it may not be possible in all cases to pre-
       clude any impact on members who are projected for assignment. Similarly, whenever possible, a
       tour length change should exclude those members currently assigned unless it is clearly appropri-
       ate to include them. Establishing a tour length change effective date which affects members
       already selected for assignment or currently assigned can create turmoil, hardship, stress on fami-
       lies and members, and generate additional PCS costs.
166                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


         3.2.1.2. When an OS tour length change requires an immediate or near-term effective date affect-
         ing members projected with an assignment or currently assigned, specific guidance will be pro-
         vided when the tour length change is announced.
      3.2.2. Tour Length Exceptions. In some instances tour lengths are specified by DoD based on duty to
      be performed or category of personnel rather than being based on the normal tour length criteria which
      is quality of life conditions. Also, for some assignments, DoD has approved an AF request for excep-
      tion to the normal prescribed tour length. The assignment instructions or other guidance will identify
      to MPFs the tour length to be served in conjunction with the assignment. When a tour length is
      based on criteria other than normal quality of life criteria (such as duty to be performed, cate-
      gory of personnel, or the tour length for AF personnel is an exception), such tours will not be
      prorated ( also see paragraph 3.11.). Requests for tour length exceptions (those which are not
      based on quality of life conditions at a location, such as, for PME, formal education, in conjunction
      with training, a school, scholarship, fellowship or grant, and so on) may be submitted per paragraph
      1.5. for consideration and approval by the appropriate level. Adequate time must be allowed to permit
      the exception request to be submitted to DoD for consideration. When it is known that the duration of
      an assignment will be less than the normal prescribed tour length for an OS location, then either a
      request for OS tour length exception must be requested and approved in advance, or curtailment of the
      tour length prescribed for the location must be requested and approved as an exception per paragraph
      1.5. Documentation on approved OS tour length exceptions, including some circumstances not listed
      in this instruction, is maintained by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1.
      3.2.3. "AF Only" Tour Lengths. The SAF may establish the tour length for a location or country not
      listed in Table 3.1. provided only AF members (fewer than 25) are assigned and it does not involve
      introducing command-sponsored dependents into an area where dependents currently are not autho-
      rized. The documentation required in support of these requests is the same as that to establish or
      change a tour length as explained in paragraph 3.2.1., but does not require DoD approval.
      3.2.4. Alaska and Hawaii Tour Lengths. Assignment to a major military installation in Alaska and
      Hawaii is, in many respects, similar to duty within the CONUS (customs, laws, language, etc.). How-
      ever, some aspects are similar to duty OS, that is, geographically separated from the CONUS, mem-
      bers receive OS entitlements, and so on. For these reasons, personnel management for most locations
      in Alaska and Hawaii is a combination of both CONUS and OS policies and procedures. Unless
      Table 3.1. indicates otherwise, both the accompanied and unaccompanied minimum tour lengths are
      36 months. Members who desire to remain assigned beyond completion of the minimum tour may opt
      to keep their automatic indefinite DEROS (see paragraph 3.8.5.1.1.), request extension of tour, or an
      IPCOT.
      3.2.5. Officer Joint Duty Assignment (JDA) OS Tour Length. See paragraph 2.15.6. To receive
      credit for completion of a JDA tour, the period of time an officer must serve OS may differ from the
      normal DoD prescribed tour length. A JDA tour is not subject to tour proration.
      3.2.6. Air Liaison Officer (ALO) Duty Tour Length.
         3.2.6.1. Officers assigned from the CONUS to OS for ALO duty must serve a minimum of 24
         months, accompanied or unaccompanied, at the ALO location. Upon completion of the 24 month
         ALO tour, officers may be reassigned on a COT to serve the full prescribed tour at the gaining
         location, for which they will receive COT leave travel entitlements, or they may be reassigned to
         the CONUS. An ALO tour is not subject to proration.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  167


     3.2.6.2. Officers reassigned intratheater to serve an ALO tour serve a minimum of 18 months of a
     36 month tour at the initial OS location. Then they must serve the remaining 18 months at the
     ALO location. COT leave travel entitlements are not authorized as this move is a continuation of
     OS tour. An ALO tour is not subject to proration.
  3.2.7. Contract Tours. Members assigned to locations where the tour length is specified by govern-
  ment-to-government contract will serve the specified contract tour. The fact that a foreign govern-
  ment may be reimbursing the US government for costs associated with a mission does not exempt the
  AF from complying with DoD and AF assignment policies. Contract tours will not be prorated.
  3.2.8. Medical Service Officer Shortage Specialty Accompanied OS Tour Length. Two and three
  year obligated medical service officers serving in shortage specialties as determined by the SAF in
  consultation with the AF Surgeon General, are allowed to serve two year accompanied tours in long
  tour areas. Travel of dependents OS, shipment of HHGs, etc., at government expense is contingent
  upon the officer meeting all other entitlement criteria except the normal accompanied long tour retain-
  ability requirement.
  3.2.9. Defense Attaché Tour Lengths. The Director, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), determines
  the tour lengths and whether the tours will be accompanied or unaccompanied for members assigned
  to the Defense Attaché System. Assignment instructions will stipulate the tour length to be served.
  Attache tours are not subject to proration.
  3.2.10. Command Sponsored Position List (CSPL) Tour Lengths. At locations where election of the
  accompanied by dependents tour is restricted by a CSPL, a limited number of members selected to
  serve what is otherwise a dependent-restricted unaccompanied tour may be given the opportunity to
  elect an accompanied by dependents tour and receive command sponsorship of dependents. The cri-
  teria used to determine who may be authorized to elect an accompanied tour may vary. Members
  identified to fill or offered a CSPL position, but who elect instead to serve the unaccompanied tour
  length, will not be required to serve the accompanied tour length.
  3.2.11. Key Billet Tour Length. Certain manpower positions may be formally designated and
  approved as "key billets" in OS units or activities where the presence of the member is of such unusual
  responsibility that continued presence for at least 24 months is determined to be absolutely essential to
  the mission and the US presence in that area. The key billet designation applies only to those OS loca-
  tions where the accompanied tour is 24 months. Members filling key billets, whether accompanied or
  unaccompanied, will serve a 24 month tour. Key billet tours are not subject to proration.
     3.2.11.1. Since it is mandatory that members filling approved key billets serve the 24 month tour,
     requests for key billet designations must be submitted, in writing, by the requester through the the-
     ater or unified commander (USCINCPAC, USCENTCOM, USCINCLANT, etc.) to the approval
     authority with an information copy to HQ AF/DPF and HQ AFPC/DPAPP1. The approval author-
     ity, as reflected in DoD 1315.7, shall be as follows:
         3.2.11.1.1. The Chairman, JCS, for the Joint Staff and other activities under its cognizance.
         3.2.11.1.2. The ASD (FM&P) for joint staffs and activities under OSD cognizance.
         3.2.11.1.3. The Secretary concerned, when subparagraphs 3.2.12.1.1. or 3.2.12.2.2. do not
         apply.
     3.2.11.2. Key billet requests must include:
168                                                     AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


             3.2.11.2.1. Specific duty location, MAJCOM, AFSC, grade, duty title, and position number.
             3.2.11.2.2. Position description and justification for a 24 month tour based on the unusual
             responsibility and need for continuity in the position.
             3.2.11.2.3. Statement that government quarters are available for the member and that concur-
             rent travel of dependents is authorized.
             3.2.11.2.4. Statement that key billet is at a location where command sponsorship of family
             members is authorized.
         3.2.11.3. Once the approval authority makes a decision, the requester, AF/DPF, and HQ AFPC/
         DPAPP1 will be notified. The approval authority and HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 will maintain a master
         listing of all approved AF key billets. When a position no longer requires key billet designation or
         the designated position changes, the original requesting activity will notify HQ AFPC/DPAPP1, in
         writing, so the master list can be kept current.
      3.2.12. Designated Location Move (DLM) Tour Length. Members selected for assignment to a
      dependent restricted location who request and receive approval for a DLM according to AFI 36-3020,
      Family Member Travel, will serve an unaccompanied tour of 24 months when the OS country where
      the member will serve is the same as the native country of his or her spouse (see Table 3.6.). A DLM
      tour is not subject to proration. For award of ODSD based on a 24 month unaccompanied DLM tour
      refer to Table 3.4.
      3.2.13. (Airmen Only) Extended Long OS Tour (ELT) Length. The AF extended long OS tour length
      is the prescribed long accompanied or unaccompanied tour shown in Table 3.1., plus 12 additional
      months. This voluntary program affords airmen special assignment selection consideration ahead of
      volunteers for the DoD prescribed OS tour length according to the priorities shown in Table 3.4. For
      example, an airman with dependents who volunteers and is selected as an ELT volunteer for a location
      with a 36 month accompanied and 24 month unaccompanied tour length would be required to serve 48
      months accompanied or 36 months unaccompanied. NOTE: This program does not apply to short
      tour locations, that is, Table 3.1. lists the tour lengths as NA/12, 24/12, or 24/15. Airmen who are
      selected for an ELT, but do not have, do not desire, or are ineligible to obtain retainability will not be
      permitted to retain an assignment and change to the standard tour length (accompanied or unaccom-
      panied). Allowing such action would result in members receiving special assignment selection prior-
      ity without serving the longer tour. After selection airmen may request release from PCS selection per
      paragraph 2.12. FTA who have extended their enlistment the maximum of 23 months may request a
      delay in obtaining the service retainability for a portion of the extended long OS tour if they have
      retainability for the prescribed standard (unaccompanied or accompanied) tour length, until arrival OS
      as outlined in paragraph 2.29. and Table 2.7. See paragraph 3.2.13.3. and Attachment 8 for ELT
      requirements in conjunction with join spouse assignment.
         3.2.13.1. The AF Form 899 which directs reassignment of members selected under this program
         must reflect both the correct total number of months the member will serve as an extended long
         tour volunteer, and the fact that the member was selected as an extended tour volunteer. For exam-
         ple, a member selected as an extended long tour volunteer for reassignment to Ramstein, Ger-
         many, who elects the accompanied tour, is required to serve a total of 48 months. Even though
         Table 3.1. reflects a tour length of 36 months for an accompanied tour to Germany, the correct
         entry for item 11 (Tour length, total number of months) of the AF Form 899 is "48." In addition,
         item 12, (Extended long tour volunteer) should reflect an "X" each time the assignment action rea-
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                               169


     son is "AO, extended tour volunteer." This is important as the gaining MPF uses the AF Form
     899 as the source document to award initial DEROS (standard accompanied or unaccompanied
     tour length plus 12 months).
     3.2.13.2. An airman serving an extended OS tour is not usually reassigned involuntarily from the
     country for which initially selected. When involuntary reassignment to another country is neces-
     sary, the tour length is prorated on request of the member according to Table 3.13., rule 2, and
     paragraph 3.11.2. On PCS notification the airman is required to sign a statement indicating
     whether or not he or she desires DEROS proration. When an airman desires DEROS proration
     and the prorated DEROS would result in the member serving less than 12 months at the gaining
     location, the MPF will reclama the assignment. The member is not allowed to depart until a
     response to the reclama is received.
     3.2.13.3. When one member of an enlisted military couple is selected as an extended tour volun-
     teer, the joining spouse (regardless of the AAR shown in the assignment) will also serve the
     extended long tour (see paragraph 3.2.13. and Attachment 8, paragraph A8.8.3.) unless waived
     by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1. Waivers to less than the prescribed accompanied standard tour length are
     not authorized.
  3.2.14. (Officers Only) Accompanied Equivalent Tour Length Program. The officer accompanied
  equivalent tour length program affords an unmarried officer with no dependents an opportunity to
  choose to serve an OS tour equal to the accompanied tour length. NOTE: This option does not apply
  to officers with a military spouse and it does not require officers who have no dependents to complete
  a tour election statement. The following procedures apply:
     3.2.14.1. During the initial relocation briefing, the MPF will counsel unmarried officers with no
     dependents of the option to choose an accompanied equivalent tour length when an accompanied
     tour is authorized by Table 3.1. For example, a single captain with no dependents selected for
     reassignment to Ramstein AB would normally serve a 24 month unaccompanied tour. Under this
     program, he or she may choose instead to serve a 36 month accompanied equivalent tour length.
     MPFs use the memo at Figure 3.1. to record an officer’s choice and the memo is the source docu-
     ment for the entry in the Remarks section of the member’s PCS orders as required below. The
     memo is filed in the member’s relocation folder.
     3.2.14.2. When an officer chooses to serve the accompanied equivalent tour length, include in the
     officer's PCS orders the total number of months to be served in item 11 of the AF Form 899 and
     include the following statement in the Remarks area "Member chose to serve the accompanied
     equivalent tour length and corresponding DEROS will be updated upon in-processing at gaining
     location."
     3.2.14.3. A officer's request to change back to the unaccompanied tour length prior to departure
     may be approved by the MPF Commander and will require amendments to the PCS orders, if pre-
     viously published, to delete the officer's choice to serve the accompanied equivalent tour length.
     3.2.14.4. DEROS extension requests for officers serving the accompanied equivalent tour length
     may still be requested as outlined in paragraph 3.8.6.
     3.2.14.5. Any request to change back to the unaccompanied tour length after departure on the OS
     PCS must be processed as a DEROS curtailment as provided in paragraph 3.8.9.2.

Tour Length Program.

MEMORANDUM FOR MPF/(office symbol)                                                                (date)
FROM: (Functional address symbol)
SUBJECT: Officer Accompanied Equivalent Tour Length Volunteer Statement


1. I (last name, first name, MI), (grade), (SSN) have a projected assignment to (location) and I volunteer
to serve the accompanied equivalent tour length at that location.
2. I understand as a result of this volunteer statement I am obligated to serve the prescribed unaccompa-
nied tour length of (# of months) PLUS an additional (# of months), which makes the total OS tour length
I agree to serve equal to the prescribed accompanied tour length shown in AFI 36-2110, Table 3.1. I
understand and agree that my active duty service commitment (ADSC) will be equal to my DEROS which
will be based on the accompanied tour length. I further understand after arrival OS that my OS tour exten-
sion opportunities and procedures for curtailment of my OS tour will be the same as others who were
required to serve the accompanied by dependents tour length.

                                                                (signature of officer)
                                                                (typed name, grade, USAF, SSN)

3.3. OS PCS Selection. As stated in paragraph 2.4., the primary factor in selection of a member for PCS
is the member's qualifications. Mission sensitivities, coupled with the OS environment, require assign-
ment of personnel whose qualifications, performance, and conduct meet established AF standards.
Among members similarly qualified, distribution of OS duty will be as equitable as possible considering
both desirable and undesirable locations. As an example, if by using only the criteria of grade, AFSC,
previous OS duty history, DAS, etc., two members might be prioritized on a nonvolunteer OS short or
long eligibility roster as numbers 18 and 34. However, when some other qualification is mandatory and
these members are the first two on the eligibility roster who possess that qualification, then they would be
prioritized as 1 and 2. Members are considered by the assignment OPR separately for OS short tour loca-
tions and long tour locations. For definition of short and long OS tour, see Attachment 1. Selection of
members for OS is based on the unaccompanied tour length. The OS duty selection date (ODSD) and the
short tour return date (STRD) as explained below, along with the number of short tours and other informa-
tion shown in Table 3.3. and Table 3.4., is used to sequence members for OS PCS priority. Other para-
graphs in this instruction on specific subjects (such as TOS, retainability, quality control, etc.) must also
be referenced in conjunction with OS PCS selection. Guidance pertains to both volunteers and nonvolun-
teers unless stated otherwise.
      3.3.1. AF members will not be assigned to active duty on land outside the US and its territories or
      possessions until they have completed AF basic training requirements. In time of war or national
      emergency declared by Congress or the President, the period of required basic training (to include spe-
      cialty training immediately following basic training), or its equivalent, shall not be less than 12 weeks.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                171


  Members must be at least 18 years of age to be assigned to a hostile fire or imminent danger area. The
  DoD Pay and Entitlements Manual designates those areas which are hostile fire or imminent danger
  areas.
  3.3.2. Noncareer officers and FTA may not refuse or decline an OS PCS based solely on their nonca-
  reer officer or FTA status. Also see paragraphs 2.14. and 2.29.5. for officers, and paragraph 2.29.6.
  for airmen.
  3.3.3. For additional guidance pertaining to volunteer status, see:
     3.3.3.1. Paragraph 2.10., Volunteer Status and PCS Eligibility;
     3.3.3.2. Paragraph 2.11., Volunteers Replacing Nonvolunteers Selected for PCS; and
     3.3.3.3. Paragraph 2.12., Change of Volunteer Status After PCS Selection.
  3.3.4. Within the OS selection priorities in Table 3.3. and Table 3.4. for nonvolunteers, ties are bro-
  ken by arranging eligibles in the order shown in the note to Table 3.14. with the senior nonvolunteer
  selected last. Ties for volunteers are broken using the same criteria and arrangement except the senior
  volunteer is selected first.
  3.3.5. When a member assigned in the CONUS is in a mandatory PCS status (see Attachment 1), and
  is vulnerable for OS PCS selection within 24 months, the OS selection priorities are as shown in Table
  3.3. and Table 3.4.
  3.3.6. For OS selection as a nonvolunteer, members who have not been credited with completion of
  an OS tour are selected before those who have been credited with completion of an OS tour (whether
  credit was the result of PCS or TDY).
  3.3.7. The amount of retainability a member has or is eligible to obtain upon completion of an OS
  tour is a factor in determining eligibility for OS PCS selection. The particular OS tour length, volun-
  teer status, and the specific reason for a member's actual or projected separation or retirement date
  have a bearing on whether or not the member is eligible for OS PCS selection. These considerations
  are reflected in Table 3.3. and Table 3.4., but may be waived. The intent is to not subject members
  selected as nonvolunteers to involuntary OS tour extension after completion of the prescribed tour
  when it is known in advance they are ineligible to obtain sufficient retainability for a CONUS assign-
  ment. Therefore, officers approaching or who have an established mandatory separation or manda-
  tory retirement date (a date prescribed by law, nonselection for promotion, etc.), and career airmen
  approaching a mandatory HYT date (age or years of service), are eligible for OS PCS selection within
  the parameters established in Table 3.3. and Table 3.4. Officers and airmen who have a separation or
  retirement date which is not a mandatory date (for example, officers who 7-day opted or airmen who
  formally declined to obtain PCS retainability and so on) and/or members who are eligible to request
  withdrawal of their separation or retirement date, are not restricted by guidance in Table 3.3. and
  Table 3.4. from OS PCS selection on the basis of insufficient retainability for CONUS PCS upon tour
  completion.
  3.3.8. OS Imbalanced AFSCs. Airmen Only. Airmen who have two or more awarded AFSCs, one of
  which is an imbalanced AFSC, are selected and perform duty OS only in the imbalanced AFSC. This
  applies to airmen who must attend en route training for award of the imbalanced AFSC and those who
  are already qualified (reference AFMAN 36-2108). OS Imbalanced AFSCs are listed in the retraining
  advisory maintained by the MPF Classification and Training Element.
172                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      3.3.9. Non-CONUS Residents. For assignment purposes (only), a non-CONUS resident is a member
      whose home of record (HOR) at the time of initial enlistment (airmen) or immediately preceding com-
      missioning (officers) is located in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, or the Panama Canal Zone (for Canal Zone
      residents only, this policy applies to those who enlisted or were commissioned and entered EAD prior
      to 1 Oct 1979). For purposes other than assignments, HOR may be defined otherwise. Since 1 May
      1985 non-CONUS residents receive credit for OS service performed in their home state/area (see
      paragraph 3.4.2.).
         3.3.9.1. Non-CONUS residents must meet all PCS eligibility criteria provided in this instruction.
         When volunteering for assignment to their home area, non-CONUS residents will have equal pri-
         ority along with other volunteers within a priority group when assignment is to a short tour loca-
         tion (see Table 3.3.). When volunteering for assignment to their home area as an OS extended
         long tour volunteer (airmen), non-CONUS residents will receive equal consideration along with
         other OS extended long tour volunteers. When volunteering for the standard OS long tour,
         non-CONUS residents are considered for assignment to their home area ahead of other standard
         OS tour volunteers (see Table 3.4.).

3.4. Credit for OS Service. Credit is given for all OS service performed in any of the Armed Forces of
the U.S. (whether in officer, warrant officer, or enlisted status) within the guidelines below. OS service
served in enlisted status counts as OS service in officer status and vice versa. For assignment purposes,
OS duty begins on the date of departure from the CONUS, unless a member has leave approved in an OS
area. For a member with approved leave in an OS area prior to reporting to a new OS duty station, credit
for OS service begins on his or her date of arrival at the new OS station. Credit for OS service ends on the
date of arrival at the CONUS port of entry, unless a member has leave approved in an OS area after com-
pletion of an OS tour. When a member has leave approved in an OS area after completion of an OS tour,
then credit for OS service ends upon departure from the current OS duty station. As explained below,
“award” of an OS service date means to give the member a new date equal to PCS tour completion or the
completion date of the last TDY performed in a cumulative TDY period which qualifies for award of a
new date. For example, a member who has never served OS might have a TAFMSD and ODSD of 10 Sep
90. Upon completion of an OS PCS on 25 Oct 99, the member would be awarded a new ODSD of 25 Oct
99. An “adjustment” of an OS service date is adding the number of days a member was in a PCS or TDY
status to a previously awarded date. For example, a member serving in the CONUS last returned from
PCS OS on 25 Sep 93 (ODSD is 25 Sep 93) and he or she performs 5 days TDY OS from 1 Feb 99
through 5 Feb 99. Upon completion of the OS TDY the member’s ODSD would be adjusted by 5 days to
30 Sep 93.
      3.4.1. In cases where the OS tour completion dates are earlier than the TAFMSD, the ODSD and
      STRD (see paragraph 3.5.1.2. and 3.5.2.2.) are updated to match the TAFMSD (the ODSD and STRD
      cannot be before a member's TAFMSD).
      3.4.2. Since 1 May 1985, non-CONUS residents of Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Canal Zone
      receive credit for OS service performed in their home state or area. No OS credit was awarded prior
      to this date.
      3.4.3. AF members performing duty with the Navy (such as officer Navy exchange tours) when
      assigned to AF units in the CONUS (which are collocated with Navy facilities) and who are deployed
      to sea are considered to be performing CONUS to OS TDY and are credited for TDY according to the
      rules in Table 3.5. Members assigned OS and are performing duty with the Navy are assigned PCS to
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                     173


   land-based AF units OS (which are collocated with Navy facilities). These members when deployed
   to sea are considered performing OS to OS TDY and are credited for TDY according to the rules in
   Table 3.5.
   3.4.4. Update of OS Service.
       3.4.4.1. OS Credit for PCS. The ODSD, STRD, and number of short tours, if applicable, will be
       automatically updated in PDS when the member completes or is curtailed from an OS tour. The
       appropriate tour credit will automatically update once the member in-processes at the new loca-
       tion and the MPF gains the member to file. Table 3.4. provides the rules for award or adjustment
       of the ODSD and/or STRD based on PCS.
       3.4.4.2. OS Credit for TDY. The ODSD, STRD, and number of short tours, if applicable, is auto-
       matically updated in PDS when a member completes 2 or more consecutive days TDY in an OS
       location. This day-for-day credit is automatic for travel vouchers filed when the member is ser-
       viced by an Air Force Financial Service Office (FSO). The interface between the AF military per-
       sonnel data system and the Defense Finance Accounting System (DFAS) makes it possible for
       members to receive automatic OS TDY credit for his or her OS service. NOTE: Members who
       perform OS TDYs and who must file their travel voucher through other than Air Force FSO (i.e.,
       Army, Navy) must provide a copy of their completed travel voucher to their CSS or MPF for indi-
       vidual update of the OS TDY to receive credit (an automatic system interface does not exist
       between Army, Navy FSOs and AF FSOs). Table 3.5. provides the rules for award or adjustment
       of the ODSD and/or STRD based on TDY.
       3.4.4.3. Errors discovered by the member or MPF on OS dates (ODSD, STRD, OS tour dates,
       and/or number of short tours) must be thoroughly researched and verified prior to submitting a
       correction of record request to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1. The MPF must conduct a records audit and
       use a combination of the following documents to verify OS tours or completed TDYs: travel
       vouchers, PCS orders, decoration citations, EPRs/OPRs, IDA’s, records review RIP. Requests for
       corrections must include the start and stop dates (day, month, and year) of the OS tour or TDY,
       specific country and location, OS tour length or number of days TDY, previous ODSD and STRD,
       and what the ODSD and STRD should be based on the information provided. Correction requests
       may be sent by any electrical means (message, CRT gram, email).
   3.4.5. Because policies, definitions, tour lengths, and so on are subject to change over time, credit for
   OS service prior to the date of this instruction will not be corrected or otherwise changed by MPFs.
   Send unusual cases such as those based on prior service or service in another branch of the US Armed
   Forces to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 (to AFGOMO for generals and general selects, and AFCMOA for colo-
   nel and colonel selectees) for review and final decision. All requests for OS duty credit for prior ser-
   vice in the US Armed Forces must include the documentation listed in paragraph 3.4.5.3. It is the
   member's responsibility to provide the documentation. Do not send cases to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 for
   review without the appropriate documentation to make a decision. In the case of prior service in
   which a member claims service at sea, include special orders assigning the member to and from the
   ship, copies of the ship's logs for the period of time sea service claimed, reports of separation verifying
   the member's prior service, and any other documentation that will substantiate the members request.
   In addition, see paragraph 3.4.4. for the policy on AF members who perform sea duty.

3.5. Overseas Duty Selection Date (ODSD) and Short Tour Return Date (STRD). The ODSD and
STRD are awarded and adjusted according to tables 18 and 19, and the following guidelines below. HQ
174                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


AFPC/DPAPP1 may authorize award or adjustment of ODSD/STRD as an exception to the guidance in
this instruction. A source document validated by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 or this instruction will authorize
such credit.
      3.5.1. ODSD. The ODSD is used along with other factors to place members in the proper sequence
      for selection for an OS tour (long or short) as shown below and in Table 3.3. and Table 3.4. For selec-
      tion for an OS short tour, the ODSD is used as shown below and in Table 3.3. The ODSD will be the
      most recent of the following:
         3.5.1.1. Non-prior service members are awarded an initial ODSD equal to their TAFMSD; or
         3.5.1.2. For prior service personnel who have completed a prior OS tour, the ODSD is either the
         TAFMSD or date member completed the OS tour, whichever is most recent. If the stop date of a
         prior service OS long tour is before the adjusted TAFMSD then the OS tour information may be
         input in the PDS under the OS tour history area for historical purposes, but this data will not adjust
         the ODSD. The ODSD will remain the same as the adjusted TAFMSD if more recent; or
         3.5.1.3. The ODSD will be the date a member arrives in the CONUS after completing a long or
         short OS tour; or
         3.5.1.4. The date which is 1 day before arrival at a new permanent duty station on a COT when
         there is no travel through the CONUS; or
         3.5.1.5. On completion of the current tour for an In-place COT (IPCOT) (see Attachment 4); or
         3.5.1.6. The date of return from the last TDY when a new ODSD is awarded (see Table 3.5.); or
         3.5.1.7. The total number of days served on an OS TDY(s) which are added day-for-day to the
         ODSD upon completion of the TDY (only TDYs of two or more consecutive days are creditable).
      3.5.2. STRD and Number of Short Tours Completed. The STRD and number of short tours com-
      pleted are used in combination with the ODSD and other factors to place members in the proper
      sequence for selection for OS short tours as shown in Table 3.3. The STRD will be the most recent of
      the following:
         3.5.2.1. Non-prior service members are awarded an initial STRD equal to their TAFMSD; or
         3.5.2.2. For prior service personnel who have completed a prior OS short tour, the STRD is either
         the TAFMSD or date member completed the OS short tour, whichever is most recent. If the stop
         date of a prior service OS short tour is before the adjusted TAFMSD then the OS tour information
         may be input in the PDS under the OS tour history area for historical purposes, but this data will
         not adjust the STRD. The STRD will remain the same as the adjusted TAFMSD if more recent; or
         3.5.2.3. The STRD will be the date the member arrives in the CONUS after completing a short
         OS tour; or
         3.5.2.4. The date which is 1 day before arrival at a new permanent duty station on a COT when
         there is no travel through the CONUS; or
         3.5.2.5. On completion of the current tour when it is a short tour for an In-place COT (IPCOT)
         (see Attachment 4); or
         3.5.2.6. The date of return from the last TDY when a new STRD is awarded (see Table 3.5.); or
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  175


       3.5.2.7. The total number of days served on an OS TDY(s) which are added day-for-day to the
       STRD upon completion (only TDYs or two or more consecutive days are creditable).

3.6. Actions Upon Notification of OS PCS Selection. The minimum period a member is required to
serve on an OS tour is based on the unaccompanied standard tour length shown in Table 3.1. (plus 12
additional months for airmen selected as ELT volunteers). The actual length of time a member will serve
is determined by options a member may have. Upon official PCS notification (see paragraph 2.32.) a
member is required, within the prescribed timeframe, to accept the unaccompanied tour length or take one
of the other authorized actions. After having accepted PCS selection for the unaccompanied tour, then
members may be eligible to make additional choices as outlined below.
   3.6.1. Home-Basing (HB) and Follow-On (FO) Assignment Programs. Lt Colonel and below and
   Airmen. The purpose of these two programs is to reduce PCS costs, reduce PCS turbulence, and
   increase stability for members and their families by providing advance assignment consideration. The
   MPF must brief all eligible members selected for or electing to serve an unaccompanied OS tour of 15
   months or less on these programs. Members must either apply or decline to apply for these programs,
   in writing, according to Attachment 5.
   3.6.2. OS Tour Election and Command Sponsorship. A member with dependents who is selected for
   an OS assignment to a location where an accompanied by dependents tour is authorized (see Table
   3.1.) will be counseled on the requirement to make an OS tour election to serve either the unaccom-
   panied or the accompanied by dependents OS tour (see Attachment 20). Attachment 20 also pro-
   vides guidance on individually sponsored dependents and dependents OS in general. Members with
   no dependents, those selected for assignment to a dependent restricted location (tour length NA/12),
   and those not being assigned to a CSPL position (tour length 24/12, such as Osan AB, see Table 3.1.,
   note 6), are not required to make a tour election.
   3.6.3. MAJCOM Requested Change of Assignment. All changes to assignments must be reviewed
   and approved by the assignment OPR. They check to see if the requirement may be filled by a man-
   datory PCS move or by a less expensive combination of moves, or if the move or change should be
   approved in light of current AF-wide manning and other factors. MAJCOM-initiated change of
   assignment requests must be forwarded as soon as the need for change arises. The MAJCOM sends
   an assignment request by message (or in-system if time permits) to the assignment OPR. HQ AFPC
   replies by message (or in-system) to the MAJCOM and MPF, indicating approval, disapproval, or
   other change. If known, the losing MPF may alert a member that he or she is being considered for
   assignment change. Members should be counseled not to take any irrevocable actions based solely on
   the MAJCOM's request for change. The change is effective upon approval of the assignment OPR.

3.7. Volunteering for Assignment To/From OS.
   3.7.1. Officers. Officers volunteer for OS tours or CONUS assignments according to AFAS guidance
   (see Attachment 17).
   3.7.2. Airmen. Assignments to and from OS (including COTs, see Attachment 4) are usually made
   with the aid of computer programs at HQ AFPC (except see Attachment 8 for join spouse assign-
   ment). Requirements (assignments which will be filled) are identified on either the Enlisted Quarterly
   Assignment Listing (EQUAL) or EQUAL-Plus (see Attachment 16). In addition, airmen may volun-
   teer for OS and record up to eight OS preferences (bases or countries) through the PC III data system
   available in each CSS. If more than one preference is listed, all preferences are considered equally for
176                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      assignment purposes. These preferences are maintained in the PDS for all OS volunteers. The follow-
      ing applies to volunteers for OS assignment:
         3.7.2.1. Airmen should not volunteer for OS tours for which they are ineligible to acquire
         required service retainability.
         3.7.2.2. Unless a deviation is granted by HQ AFPC/DPAA, airmen possessing more than one
         AFSC, one of which is imbalanced, are selected for OS assignment in the imbalanced AFSC (see
         paragraph 3.3.9.).
         3.7.2.3. Volunteer preferences reflect tour lengths as short, long, or extended long as defined in
         Attachment 1. Volunteers list their tour length preference based on the tour length prescribed for
         the desired area as shown in Table 3.1. Volunteers who desire consideration for any location
         which is OS should indicate "worldwide" in the first OS country preference. Volunteers are con-
         sidered for selection as follows:
         3.7.2.4. Volunteers for OS locations, countries, or areas are considered for the specific prefer-
         ences they state with unaccompanied tour lengths consistent with their tour length preference.
         3.7.2.5. Volunteers for worldwide OS duty are considered for assignment to any location. (The
         actual tour length each member serves is determined by the tour length preference (short or long),
         country, duty location, marital or dependency status, grade, and availability of housing).
         3.7.2.6. A volunteer is considered for assignment to a country/base of preference only until his or
         her turn for involuntary OS selection is reached, at which time the airman is considered for OS
         assignment along with other eligible nonvolunteers.
         3.7.2.7. An airman with an AAC in the PDS may volunteer for OS at any time. However, the
         member will not be selected for an OS assignment with a departure date prior to the expiration of
         the AAC (see paragraph 2.15.1.) unless waived by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1.
         3.7.2.8. Career airmen are not eligible for OS assignment selection if their HYT precludes them
         from obtaining retainability to serve the full accompanied tour length or the unaccompanied tour
         plus 12 months in accordance with Table 2.6. Reenlistment or extension of enlistment beyond
         HYT for the purpose of obtaining PCS retainability or to serve the accompanied tour length is not
         authorized.
      3.7.3. Assignment Matches. After allocations are reviewed and changed, OS returnees are matched
      against them using the match priorities shown in Table 3.14. This first step in the computer program
      tries to match airmen with awarded SEIs against allocations with SEI requirements, while satisfying
      the airmen’s preferences. The second step is an attempt to match SEI requirements while ignoring
      preferences. The third step is an attempt to match preferences. If neither an SEI match nor a prefer-
      ence match can be made, OS returnees are given CONUS assignments based on AFSC, grade, and
      skill level. SEIs are used in the assignment process if MAJCOMs code their no-name allocations with
      the desired SEI and the AFPC assignment OPR approves match by SEI.
      3.7.4. PALACE FUSE. Airmen. The MPF sends a PALACE FUSE message to the HQ AFPC
      assignment OPR when an airman is within 60 days of the first day of the DEROS month and has not
      received an assignment. The HQ AFPC assignment OPR will provide assignment instructions to the
      MPF by return message. When the member is assigned to a GSU, include the unit of assignment as an
      information addressee on the message. The PALACE FUSE message from the MPF will include:
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    177


       3.7.4.1. Grade, name, SSN, CAFSC.
       3.7.4.2. DEROS, SEIs, CONUS and OS preferences.
       3.7.4.3. All AACs and ALCs with date of availability/expiration date, if applicable.
       3.7.4.4. Date of separation. Include statement to show whether member extended or reenlisted,
       and date of action.
       3.7.4.5. If there are any personnel actions, assignment actions, or requests for assignment pending
       that could conflict with PALACE FUSE assignment. If so, state the kind of action and the status.
       If none, so state.
       3.7.4.6. If member previously declined an assignment, was declination statement signed, and date
       signed? Was the member a career airman or a first-term airman when declination was signed?
       3.7.4.7. GSU (unit and location) to which member is assigned, if applicable.
   3.7.5. CMSgts. OS selections and returnee assignment match processes for CMSgts are shown in
   Attachment 16.
   3.7.6. (Airmen) MAJCOM inputs to HQ AFPC Enlisted Allocation Programs. MAJCOMs may use
   the allocation plug table and the MAJCOM manning plan maintained by HQ AFPC/DPAAS to control
   some features of the allocations they receive. The plug table can be used to insert values for SEI, PPC,
   security access requirements, and other variables in the allocation for specified end assignment or
   AFSCs. The manning plug can be used to specify the desired manning level for an end assignment or
   AFSC in terms of a specific percentage, a maximum percentage, a minimum percentage, or a given
   percentage above the MAJCOM average. MAJCOMs may set up or change plug table and manning
   plan entries by contacting HQ AFPC/DPAAS.

3.8. Date Eligible for Return from OS (DEROS) Management. The following paragraphs provide
guidance on initial establishment and computation of DEROS, adjustment of DEROS, the OS Returnee
Counseling Program, DEROS options (such as, indefinite DEROS, extension, IPCOT), DEROS curtail-
ments, and DEROS proration. Any request that might result in a change of DEROS for an officer serving
in a JDA position must be coordinated with the joint organization (Director, J-1, or equivalent) and HQ
AFPC/DPAPP1.
   3.8.1. Initial DEROS Establishment and Computation. The tour length for the initial DEROS is
   established according to Table 3.9., a member’s tour election, remarks in PCS orders, the Assignment
   Action Reason or instructions from the assignment OPR. The DEROS is computed by adding the OS
   tour length (in months) to the date departed CONUS (or DAS when applicable). For example, a mem-
   ber who departs the CONUS on 20 Jun 98 to serve a 36 month tour would have a DEROS of 20 Jun
   01. A member who departs the CONUS on 1 Sep 98 to serve a 12 month tour would have a DEROS
   of 1 Sep 99. No other method will be used to compute the DEROS. The DEROS is updated per
   AFCSM 36-699. The DEROS for general officers and general officer selectees is established or
   adjusted at the discretion of the SAF. On arrival of a general officer or selectee at the OS duty station,
   the DEROS is established as shown in Table 3.9., or based on assignment instructions from the
   assignment OPR. MPFs do not change the DEROS of general officers (or selectees) once initially
   established. Send DEROS change requests out of system to AFGOMO Washington DC 20330-5000
   for approval and reentry into PDS. For all members, when PCS orders show the member elected the
   accompanied tour, the initial DEROS is based on the accompanied tour length, whether or not the
178                                                     AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      member arrives with dependents or not. If the member desires to change his or her tour election after
      arrival at the OS duty station, see Table 3.8. and/or Attachment 20.
      3.8.2. Adjustment of DEROS. An adjustment of DEROS is a change (extension, curtailment, prora-
      tion, tour election change, etc.) after initial award. Table 3.9. describes those events which necessitate
      adjustment of DEROS.
      3.8.3. DEROS Election Option or Forecast Notification RIPs. All members assigned OS through the
      grade of colonel will receive a DEROS Election Option or Forecast Notification RIP which reflects
      several DEROS Options. The DEROS Election Option RIP is produced at short tour locations (for
      officers and airmen) and for airmen (only) who are eligible to make an OTEIP election (see Attach-
      ment 15) at long tour locations. The DEROS Forecast Notification RIP is produced at all other loca-
      tions (that is, officer and airmen at long tour locations, except for airmen eligible to make an OTEIP
      election). The generation of the RIP, its purpose, and DEROS options are explained below.
         3.8.3.1. At locations where the unaccompanied tour length is 18 months or more, the DEROS
         Election Option or Forecast Notification RIP is produced between 13 to 15 months prior to a
         member's DEROS.
         3.8.3.2. At locations where the unaccompanied tour length is less than 18 months, the DEROS
         Election Option or Forecast Notification RIP is produced 10 months prior to DEROS.
         3.8.3.3. Both the DEROS Election Option and Forecast Notification RIPs require a member to
         elect one of the DEROS management options listed in paragraphs 3.8.5. Depending on which
         option the member elects, additional actions may be required, such as obtaining the required
         retainability.
             3.8.3.3.1. Members who receive a DEROS Election Option RIP must review it, initial next to
             their preference, sign the RIP, and have their supervisor and commander sign it. The RIP must
             be returned to the MPF within 30 days from the day it was produced. MPFs must suspense the
             RIP and follow-up in the event of nonreceipt.
             3.8.3.3.2. Members who receive a DEROS Forecast Notification RIP must review their
             options and elect a DEROS option using PC-III. The member should update the elected
             DEROS option either at the CSS or MPF within 30 days from the day the RIP was produced.
             Once the DEROS option is updated in PC-III the request will electronically flow to the com-
             mander for coordination. Once the commander completes the action on the DEROS request it
             will automatically flow to the MPF and then to the MAJCOM. The MAJCOM has disap-
             proval authority, but recommends approval to HQ AFPC. HQ AFPC is the final approval
             authority for all DEROS option requests.
      3.8.4. OS Returnee Counseling Program. All members assigned OS must be advised of the specific
      options available to them. To accomplish this, airmen must be given the Enlisted OS Returnee Coun-
      seling Handout and officers must be given the Air Force Assignment System Guide (AFAS). The
      handout or guide must be given to each member at the same time they receive their DEROS Election
      Option or Forecast Notification RIP. The MPF is responsible for providing up-to-date handouts to
      each CSS. The CSS is responsible for ensuring each AF member in their unit receives the handout or
      guide along with their RIP. Each AF member is responsible for reading the contents of the handout or
      guide and ensuring they understand all their DEROS options or seek assistance.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 179


     3.8.4.1. The minimum OS returnee counseling requirements are satisfied when the CSS or MPF
     provides the member a copy of the handout or guide and confirms the member's acknowledgment
     of receipt. A member's receipt of the handout or guide is the primary proof that counseling has
     been provided. The MPF or the CSS are encouraged to conduct face-to-face OS returnee counsel-
     ing briefings either individually or by group to supplement the information in the handout and
     guide. MPFs must arrange individual counseling upon request.
  3.8.5. DEROS Options. Most DEROS options (Extensions [to include OTEIP], IPCOTs, Indefinite
  DEROS) are intended to increase the stability of the member and family (if accompanied), save PCS
  costs by deferring or eliminating the move of the member and his or her replacement, and provide
  continuity to the unit of assignment. Each DEROS Option must be reviewed on its individual merits
  and a recommendation for approval or disapproval must be based on a combination of factors. These
  factors include eligibility, duty performance, conduct, adaptability, medical suitability, the impact of
  continued OS duty on the member and family, and opportunities for continued local career progres-
  sion. A recommendation for disapproval may not be based solely on the passage of time.
     3.8.5.1. Indefinite DEROS. Members who desire to remain at the OS duty location beyond their
     minimum prescribed tour length may elect the indefinite DEROS option. The commander recom-
     mends approval or may disapprove the Indefinite DEROS request. If the commander disapproves
     the request, it must be reviewed by the MSS/CC to ensure the disapproval is consistent with DoD
     and AF policy (members may not be reassigned based solely on the passage of time). If the MSS/
     CC finds the disapproval is inequitable or not in compliance with policy, the request must be for-
     warded to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 for a final decision, with an information copy to the parent MAJ-
     COM. Members must comply with procedures outlined in paragraph 3.8.3.3. to request an
     Indefinite DEROS.
         3.8.5.1.1. For Alaska or Hawaii, members assigned to a long tour location have their DEROS
         automatically changed to indefinite at the time their DEROS Election Option or DEROS Fore-
         cast RIP is produced. Members options are: confirming and accepting the indefinite DEROS
         with their commander’s concurrence; requesting reinstatement of the original DEROS; or
         electing any other option reflected on the RIP.
         3.8.5.1.2. Airmen with an indefinite DEROS who have OS preferences reflected in the PDS
         will receive continuous consideration for COT selection.
         3.8.5.1.3. Airmen with an indefinite DEROS must maintain at least 8 months service retain-
         ability to maintain the indefinite DEROS and receive continuous COT consideration. Once an
         airman is within 8 months of DOS, he or she will no longer be considered for a COT and will
         have their DEROS automatically established to match their DOS. This, in turn, will cause the
         airman to be identified for separation. Airmen must obtain and maintain sufficient service
         retainability to avoid establishment of an involuntary DEROS as outlined in paragraph
         2.29.6.5. and Table 3.12.
         3.8.5.1.4. Eligible airmen who want to participate in the OS Tour Extension Incentive Pro-
         gram (OTEIP) cannot also elect an indefinite DEROS, and vice versa. Participation in the
         OTEIP requires airmen to make an entitlement election and agree to a specific period (12
         month extension), and the period must have a specific start and stop date.
         3.8.5.1.5. To establish a DEROS from an indefinite DEROS, members must request a
         DEROS option RIP through PC-III . The requested DEROS cannot be more than 15 months,
180                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


             nor less than 12 months from the date of request. To allow for systematic rotation the unit
             commander, parent MAJCOM, or the assignment OPR may approve an alternate DEROS that
             is not more than 15 months or less than 9 months from the date on the DEROS RIP. Officers
             with an indefinite DOS who want to separate or retire upon completion of their OS tour must
             request establishment of a DEROS which coincides with the date of separation or date of
             retirement requested. Airmen who desire to retire should request establishment of a DEROS
             to coincide with their retirement application. Airmen who desire to separate will automati-
             cally have a DEROS established when they get within 8 months of DOS.
             3.8.5.1.6. A member’s unit commander or the member’s parent MAJCOM can request a
             DEROS be established from an indefinite DEROS for the reasons listed in paragraph 3.8.5., or
             when such action serves the best interest of the AF. In addition, the assignment OPR may also
             initiate such action. Final decision on any request submitted under this paragraph is the
             assignment OPR.
      3.8.6. Voluntary DEROS Extension. Members may request a DEROS extension not to exceed the
      standard accompanied tour length at the current location in a single increment. Upon deciding how
      long to extend, members should consider if they will be eligible to obtain at least 12 months retain-
      ability after the requested DEROS in order to be eligible for a CONUS PCS. Also, airmen in an SRB
      AFSC requesting a DEROS extension should be counseled in regards to the affect on their SRB due to
      retainability requirements for the DEROS extension. SRB eligible personnel should consider request-
      ing a retainability suspense delay as outlined in Table 2.7. All other airmen must obtain the appropri-
      ate retainability as outlined in paragraph 2.29.6.4.6. To request a voluntary DEROS extension
      members must comply with procedures as outlined in paragraph 3.8.6.6. above.
         3.8.6.1. Approval/Disapproval Authority. Unit commanders may recommend approval or disap-
         prove extension requests as outlined in Table 3.11. Approval recommendations will be forwarded
         to the parent MAJCOM, which may disapprove the request or recommend approval to the assign-
         ment OPR. Assignment OPRs approve or disapprove extension requests submitted for consider-
         ation.
         3.8.6.2. Airmen not recommended for reenlistment or promotion are not eligible for voluntary
         extension of OS tour.
         3.8.6.3. Airmen eligible for the OTEIP must apply using their DEROS Election Option RIP and
         ensure their extension request is directly processed and updated only by the MPF. An OTEIP
         extension is different than other voluntary DEROS extensions. Refer to Attachment 15 for fur-
         ther OTEIP guidance.
         3.8.6.4. DEROS extensions for members of military couples (who marry during current OS tour)
         at an OS area without government approved accompanied housing are not authorized, except for
         the purpose of establishing a common DEROS in order to facilitate join spouse assignment con-
         sideration according to Attachment 8.
         3.8.6.5. Members ineligible to obtain CONUS PCS service retainability computed in accordance
         with Table 2.5. (for example, airmen who decline to obtain retainability) will have their DEROS
         involuntarily extended to match their DOS (see Table 3.12.).
         3.8.6.6. A DEROS extension request submitted later than 30 days from the day the DEROS Elec-
         tion Option or DEROS Forecast Notification RIP is produced must be submitted and considered
         as an exception to policy. This type of request must be fully justified and may be disapproved by
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                181


     the commander. When the unit commander recommends approval, the request is submitted
     out-of-system to the MPF for forwarding to the parent MAJCOM. The parent MAJCOM may dis-
     approve the request or recommend approval and forward the request to the assignment OPR for a
     final decision.
     3.8.6.7. Members surplus to current unit authorizations may request a DEROS extension and may
     be approved if they can be utilized within another MAJCOM at the same location. The MPF for-
     wards this type request, along with recommendations of both commanders concerned, to the pro-
     posed gaining MAJCOM of assignment. An information copy of the request is furnished to the
     current MAJCOM of assignment and the HQ AFPC assignment OPR. Both MAJCOMs provide a
     recommendation to HQ AFPC for a final determination. If approved, appropriate PCA instruc-
     tions and DEROS change are flowed via PDS.
     3.8.6.8. Members may request cancellation of any part of an approved voluntary DEROS exten-
     sion provided:
         3.8.6.8.1. The new DEROS does not place an airman within the OS allocation cycle (which is
         different than the OS returnee cycle) as outlined in Attachment 16, EQUAL, or an officer
         does not have an ASD according to Table 2.8.
         3.8.6.8.2. Members have or obtain the full minimum service retainability for a CONUS
         assignment as outlined in Table 2.5.
         3.8.6.8.3. Members who have voluntarily extended their OS tour are not involuntarily reas-
         signed during the period of extension to any other location without the approval of HQ AFPC/
         DPAPP1. If reassignment is mandatory, these members will be reported to the appropriate HQ
         AFPC assignment OPR as available for CONUS assignment.
         3.8.6.8.4. OS DEROS extension is viewed as a commitment to the member. Requests for can-
         cellation of all or part of a DEROS extension by the member's commander and/or MAJCOM
         is an exception to procedures and must be fully justified to the HQ AFPC assignment OPR.
         Cancellation of an approved voluntary extension should not be taken in lieu of appropriate
         administrative or disciplinary action. Cancellation due to force structure changes or authoriza-
         tion deletions does not require additional justification.
  3.8.7. Airmen. Members serving in short tour areas who extend their OS tour for a period of 6 or
  more months and those in long tour areas who extend for a period of 12 months are given higher
  assignment priority within their returnee match group as outlined in Table 3.14. This is done to
  encourage members to ask for voluntary OS DEROS extension.
  3.8.8. In-Place Consecutive OS Tour (IPCOT). Members may request an additional OS tour at their
  current duty station using procedures outlined in paragraph 3.8.6.6. and Attachment 4. The IPCOT
  tour length must be equal to or greater than the tour length currently being served. An IPCOT is a new
  tour, not an extension. The DAS does not change because there is no change in duty station.
  (EXCEPTIONS: A member serving an accompanied tour who has a change in dependent status and
  is no longer accompanied by dependents may request an unaccompanied IPCOT. In addition, airmen
  may request a standard tour length IPCOT if currently serving the extended long tour and single offic-
  ers with no dependents may request a standard unaccompanied tour length IPCOT if serving the
  accompanied equivalent tour length.). Additional guidance on IPCOT is outlined in Attachment 4.
182                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      3.8.9. Curtailment of OS Tour. To offset the costs associated with OS assignments, provide opera-
      tional continuity, and reduce the frequency of PCS, members will serve the full prescribed tour length
      for which they are assigned. Reassignment of members that involve PCS earlier than the DEROS
      month is a curtailment, except when the member requests cancellation of all or part of a previously
      approved voluntary DEROS extension (see paragraph 3.8.6.8. and Table 3.11.). An IPCOT is a new
      tour, not an extension. The needs of the AF may require curtailment and reassignment before comple-
      tion of the prescribed tour; however, such decisions are kept to an absolute minimum.
         3.8.9.1. Curtailments may be granted on an individual case-by-case basis if that is the only
         recourse available, and the action is clearly in the best interest of the AF. Table 3.11. lists those
         reasons for which curtailment of an OS tour may be considered, who must originate requests, and
         who is the approval authority.
         3.8.9.2. A curtailment request for a reason other than those listed in Table 3.11. is an exception
         and must be processed in accordance with paragraph 1.5. with full justification. Exception cur-
         tailment requests for more than 60 days must originate from a general officer or colonel in a wing
         commander position or equivalent. Equivalent is defined as a senior rater, colonel or higher mili-
         tary rank only. In addition, curtailment exception requests must clearly show that the AF member
         is experiencing an unusual situation in comparison to other members in similar circumstances, or
         that the member is being adversely affected more severely than other members in similar circum-
         stances, and that the desire to be curtailed does not stem from factors over which the member had
         (or should have had) reasonable control or which they caused by their own actions. Requests for
         curtailment as an exception based solely on personal reasons will not be considered.
         3.8.9.3. Member-initiated exception requests for OS tour curtailment may be disapproved at any
         level (commander, installation commander, MAJCOM, or assignment OPR). If denied locally, the
         request is returned to the member with the rationale for disapproval. HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 is the
         approval authority for curtailment exception requests or will forward to the appropriate level as
         necessary.
         3.8.9.4. Changes to DEROS for authorized reasons such as proration or a member's request to
         cancel part of voluntary DEROS extension do not constitute a curtailment of OS tour (for airmen
         serving an extended long OS tour, cancellation only applies to a DEROS extension over and above
         the full extended tour). However, the adjusted DEROS will not be within the airmen OS alloca-
         tion cycle as outlined in Attachment 16, and for officers the adjusted DEROS must not result in
         the officer receiving an ASD which is past, unless an exception is requested and approved by the
         assignment OPR (see Table 2.8., rule 3, for the ASD schedule).
         3.8.9.5. In limited circumstances, members may be curtailed and reassigned on COTs without
         having completed the full tour lengths at both the losing and gaining locations. Such curtailment/
         reassignment requests are exceptions and must be originated by a general or flag officer (except
         for humanitarian/EFMP requests or curtailments of less than 60 days). Reassignment must be
         within the same theater. Further, only those exceptions that result in the member serving at least
         the equivalent of two unaccompanied tours can be considered for approval by HQ AFPC/CC. A
         request that a member serve less than the equivalent of two unaccompanied tours can only be
         authorized by the SAF. Computation of the equivalent of two unaccompanied tours is as follows:
         If a member is assigned from a 36/24 month tour area within the same theater to a 36/24 month
         tour area, the member must serve not less than 48 months total between the two locations before
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  183


     being reassigned from the theater. Refer to Attachment 4 for further information on COT assign-
     ments.
     3.8.9.6. Terminal leave taken before the DEROS does not result in tour curtailment or accelerated
     replacement action. Ordinary leave taken before DEROS must begin and end in the local area;
     therefore, it may not be taken as a means of accelerating the departure before DEROS.
     3.8.9.7. AFGOMO effects curtailments of OS tours for general officers and selectees at the direc-
     tion of the SAF.
  3.8.10. Curtailment of OS Tour or Restriction from OS Duty for Cause. If a member and/or his or
  her dependents are involved in a serious incident in the host country which has resulted, or could
  result, in significant adverse publicity to the United States, prompt, positive action must be taken.
  However, curtailment and reassignment must not be used in lieu of appropriate administrative or dis-
  ciplinary action, and should be used only as a last resort.
     3.8.10.1. In most situations misconduct on the part of dependents, in itself, is not an appropriate
     reason to curtail and reassign the military member. Normally, early return of dependents due to
     misconduct is processed under AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel, and the JFTR, without cur-
     tailment of the military member. The exception is when the severity of the incident(s) is such that
     senior installation leadership believes curtailment and reassignment of the member is justified due
     to the strong likelihood of adverse publicity to the United States that can only be prevented by
     removal of the member and family from the OS area.
     3.8.10.2. Where there is evidence of spousal or child abuse or neglect, involuntary curtailment
     and reassignment may be requested if an effective family advocacy program cannot be established
     locally, or the family's needs exceed local capabilities. In addition, these are sensitive issues
     which could lead to criminal, administrative, or other actions that may cause embarrassment or
     adverse publicity to the United States government. If senior installation leadership believes a
     member should be reassigned and the member does not choose to apply for reassignment under
     humanitarian provisions, (see Attachment 7, paragraph A7.9.6.), then the commander may
     request curtailment and reassignment of the member under this provision. The commander must
     comply with AFI 40-301, Family Advocacy, and the following paragraphs.
     3.8.10.3. Requesting Curtailment for Cause. When curtailment for cause is necessary, the request
     must originate or be endorsed by the installation commander. Requests are processed through the
     host OS MAJCOM for DPA and JA recommendation to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1, with information
     copies to the parent MAJCOM if applicable. NOTE: If the curtailment request is based on inci-
     dents which have resulted, or could result in significant adverse publicity to the United States, also
     forward a copy of the request to: HQ USAF/JAI, 1420 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC
     20330-1420. All requests must include:
         3.8.10.3.1. Member's name, grade, SSN, CAFSC (airmen) or DAFSC (officers), DEROS,
         and unit.
         3.8.10.3.2. Full facts and circumstances warranting curtailment and reassignment or other
         restriction.
         3.8.10.3.3. Details on involvement of host country to include what, if any, adverse publicity
         has occurred.
         3.8.10.3.4. Details regarding jurisdiction over the offense, if appropriate.
184                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


             3.8.10.3.5. Administrative or disciplinary action taken or pending against the member, or why
             these actions were not deemed appropriate.
             3.8.10.3.6. Installation JA recommendation, to include if any objection exists to the reassign-
             ment from the area by the host country, the American Embassy, or United States military
             authorities in the country concerned.
             3.8.10.3.7. The number of dependents and whether member is command sponsored.
             3.8.10.3.8. Reasons why curtailment and reassignment within the theater would not be a bet-
             ter solution than reassignment to the CONUS.
             3.8.10.3.9. CONUS assignment preferences.
             3.8.10.3.10. Recommendation whether or not member should be restricted from a return
             assignment to the same OS area. Indicate whether this restriction should be temporary or per-
             manent.
      3.8.11. If the curtailment and reassignment request is based on dependent misconduct include the fol-
      lowing in addition to the above required information.
         3.8.11.1. Actions taken by the military member to correct the problem and reasons why the spon-
         sor cannot, or will not, solve the problem.
         3.8.11.2. Actions taken by the commander to solve the problem to include administrative or disci-
         plinary actions taken against the military member when it is within his or her capability to solve
         the problem. NOTE: While the military member cannot be held directly responsible for the mis-
         conduct of his or her dependents, lack of action or refusal by the member without justifiable hard-
         ship, humanitarian, or medical reasons, to influence the dependents to return, presumptively
         indicates an attitude that is incompatible with the maintenance of good order and discipline. Com-
         manders should take appropriate administrative or disciplinary action before requesting curtail-
         ment of the member.
      3.8.12. Requests to Restrict Future OS Assignments Without Curtailment. On occasion while
      assigned OS, members or their dependents may establish an unfavorable record of misconduct (that is,
      on or off base incidents, black-marketing, and so forth) which may indicate they should be restricted
      from specific future OS assignments. Although there may be insufficient justification to warrant a
      curtailment for cause, an intervening length of time in the CONUS may be appropriate before the
      member is allowed to return to a specific OS base, country, or area. If the installation commander
      determines that a restriction would be in the best interests of the AF, process the request before the
      departure of the member from the OS area as follows:
         3.8.12.1. Requests, including installation JA recommendation, are processed through the host OS
         MAJCOM/DPA/JA to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 and include the information listed in paragraph
         3.8.10.3.

3.9. Emergency Leave, Members Assigned OS. The criteria for granting emergency leave are in AFI
36-3003. A member granted emergency leave must return OS to complete their OS tour unless the mem-
ber requests and is granted a curtailment according to Table 3.11. Unit commanders must carefully assess
their manning requirements when considering these curtailment requests. Curtailment approval is with
the understanding that TDY manning assistance or accelerated replacement will not be provided. If the
immediate commander concurs with the request, he or she may approve the curtailment if, upon comple-
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 185


tion of emergency leave, the member has 60 calendar days or less remaining to DEROS. Notify the MPF
once curtailment is approved. If the requested curtailment is more than 60 days, then the request must be
processed as an exception in accordance with paragraph 1.5.
   3.9.1. If a member is granted emergency leave after the MPF has received his or her CONUS assign-
   ment based on the original DEROS, that assignment will usually remain firm. The MPF advises the
   assignment OPR, by message, of the member's departure date from the OS area on leave, number of
   days leave the commander approved, date to which the OS tour is being curtailed by the commander,
   and the member's leave address and phone number. If a second PCS DLA in the same fiscal year is
   required, refer to paragraph 2.52.
   3.9.2. When a member is granted emergency leave during the OS returnee assignment cycle, but
   before receipt of a CONUS assignment, and curtailment of OS tour is requested, the MPF sends a
   message to the assignment OPR with an information copy to the losing MAJCOM, requesting curtail-
   ment and assignment. The message must contain: (1) Grade, Name, SSN; (2) DAFSC (Officers) or
   CAFSC (Airmen), and additional AFSCs; (3) Date Departed CONUS; (4) Date Departed on Emer-
   gency Leave; (5) Current DEROS; (6) Updated Assignment Preferences, if possible; (7) Reason for
   Emergency Leave; (8) Leave Address and Phone Number; (9) and whether this is the second PCS dur-
   ing the current fiscal year.
       3.9.2.1. Upon receipt of the MPF message, the assignment OPR processes the curtailment request
       and, if approved, provides a CONUS assignment by return message to the gaining and losing
       MPFs, MAJCOMs, and the member at his or her leave address. At the same time, the assignment
       OPR updates the DEROS and projects the assignment in PDS. The losing MPF issues orders
       unless the assignment OPR authorizes another MPF to issue orders. Copies of the orders are for-
       warded to the member at the leave address, gaining and losing MAJCOMs, and the gaining MPF.
       3.9.2.2. If the member has a DOS or an approved retirement date within 60 calendar days of the
       date departing on emergency leave, he or she is given the opportunity to choose early separation or
       retirement at the MPF nearest to the emergency leave address. Before the member leaves the OS
       area, the losing MPF gets a signed statement of the member's desires. If separation is requested
       and the commander concurs, the MPF issues orders assigning the member PCS without PCA to
       the MPF nearest the emergency leave address for separation processing. These orders must
       include the remarks: "Emergency leave returnee with insufficient retainability for PCS." If cur-
       tailment is approved and adjustment of an approved retirement or separation date is required,
       ensure compliance with AFI 36-3203, Service Retirement, AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separa-
       tion of Airmen, or AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers.
       3.9.2.3. If the member does not request and receive approval of curtailment before departure on
       emergency leave, leave orders must indicate that the member is to return to the OS unit on com-
       pletion of emergency leave.

3.10. Involuntary DEROS Extension. Involuntarily extension of a member's OS tour beyond the
DEROS month is authorized only for those reasons shown in Table 3.12. and in accordance with this
paragraph. Also refer to paragraph 3.10.6. for situations where the member is retained OS beyond
DEROS with no involuntary DEROS extension (and the DEROS is allowed to expire).
   3.10.1. Insufficient Retainability for CONUS Assignment. Members are not returned to the CONUS
   with less than the minimum service retainability as provided in paragraph 2.29. and Table 2.5. Mem-
186                                                     AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      bers who do not have the required retainability are given the opportunity to obtain it (except officers
      with a mandatory DOS or retirement date and airmen not eligible due to quality reasons or HYT) as
      part of the OS returnee counseling requirements or DEROS option election. Members who do not
      have or are ineligible to obtain the required retainability will have their DEROS automatically
      extended involuntarily to match their DOS (see Table 3.12.). Members who have had their DEROS
      involuntarily extended to match their DOS because of insufficient retainability for PCS will not have
      their original DEROS reinstated solely as the result of acquiring retainability after the established cut-
      off. The computer-produced DEROS change RIP is used as the source document for involuntary OS
      tour extension.
      3.10.2. Involuntary Extension of OS Tour for Cause. DoD and, in turn, the AF permit involuntary
      extension of members in the OS area for limited specific reasons. This paragraph provides the losing
      commander the opportunity to involuntarily extend members in order to take appropriate action to
      rehabilitate, discipline, or separate those members, who by their actions or performance, have demon-
      strated they are unwilling or unable to meet minimum AF standards. Involuntary extension is a func-
      tion of command and the decision to extend rests solely with the losing commander. Members may be
      involuntarily extended as indicated below, in increments of 30 days, not to exceed a total of 120 days.
      For reasons not specifically listed below, or when the reason in combination with a member’s accom-
      panied/unaccompanied status is other than shown, or for periods longer than 120 days, an involuntary
      extension request must be submitted to, and approved in advance by, HQ AFPC/DPAPP1. Requests
      submitted to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 may require further processing to DoD for approval as exceptions.
         3.10.2.1. The reasons and authority for involuntary OS tour extensions are limited and specific.
         For the purpose of PCS assignments the term "admin hold" is too general in nature; all involuntary
         extensions must be based on one of the specific reasons authorized or approval of the extension
         received as an exception. Unit commanders must take prompt administrative or disciplinary
         action to reduce the need for involuntary OS extension. When more time is necessary to complete
         an administrative or disciplinary action, they may request involuntary DEROS extension. The
         commander exercising Special Court Martial (SPCM) authority (or HQ AFPC/CC) may approve
         a unit commander’s request for involuntary DEROS extension of a member serving any OS tour
         (accompanied or unaccompanied, short or long), for the following reasons. (Approval authority
         may not be delegated). When the SPCM authority approves an involuntary extension, the MPF
         must take PDS update action as prescribed in paragraph 3.10.4. NOTE: Members serving an
         unaccompanied short tour can be involuntarily extended for only the following reasons.
             3.10.2.1.1. AFOSI or Security Forces investigation (AAC 17).
             3.10.2.1.2. Court Martial or civil charges preferred (AAC 15).
             3.10.2.1.3. Key and essential (material witness) (AAC 14) at courts-martial.
             3.10.2.1.4. Completion of Article 15 action (AAC 12). Does not include suspended punish-
             ment period.
             3.10.2.1.5. Completion of Administrative Discharge Actions and/or Article 32 investigations
             (AAC 21).
             3.10.2.1.6. Compliance with the host country’s customs regulations.
      3.10.3. In addition to the reasons listed above, a unit commander may request, and the commander
      exercising SPCM authority (or HQ AFPC/CC) may approve, involuntary DEROS extension of a
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  187


  member serving accompanied, short or long tour, or accompanied or unaccompanied at a long tour
  (see Attachment 1) location for the following reasons. (Approval authority may not be delegated).
  Upon approval, the MPF must take PDS update action as prescribed in paragraph 3.10.4.
     3.10.3.1. Airmen nonselected for reenlistment (AAC 10, authorized only in conjunction with
     rehabilitative, administrative, or disciplinary action also being taken).
     3.10.3.2. Control Roster (AAC 16).
     3.10.3.3. Airmen only. Administrative Demotion (AAC 21).
     3.10.3.4. Airmen only. Last EPR promotion recommendation is "1" or "2" (authorized only if the
     commander also places the member on the control roster with a commander-directed EPR at the
     conclusion of the observation period).
     3.10.3.5. Unsatisfactory progress on the weight management program (weight status code "2" and
     only authorized if rehabilitative, administrative, or disciplinary action is also being taken).
     3.10.3.6. Mandatory retraining action (authorized only if reporting identifier 9A100 applies).
  3.10.4. Involuntary extension requires a change in DEROS. If a member is involuntarily extended,
  the servicing MPF updates PDS to reflect the appropriate AAC from Table 2.1., ALC from Table 2.2.,
  or WMP status code, and then updates the DEROS using PTI 404 procedures according to AFCSM
  36-699, paragraph 5.18. Local updates to involuntarily extend the DEROS must be accomplished
  prior to the current DEROS date reflected in the PDS. If PDS action to involuntarily extend the
  DEROS is taken after the DEROS date on file, the update will reject. In these situations, a message
  request to the assignment OPR, with information copies to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1, the parent MAJ-
  COM, and the gaining MAJCOM and MPF are necessary. A message request must include full facts
  and circumstances, to include date action was approved by SPCM authority. Assignments on file will
  not normally be changed or canceled unless the member is pending assignment on a COT, OS fol-
  low-on, or is otherwise disqualified according to the assignment instructions, or cancellation is in the
  best interests of the AF. The assignment RNLTD will be adjusted by the assignment OPR as neces-
  sary.
  3.10.5. Involuntary Extension of OS Tour for Operational Requirements, Training, Education, Unit
  Deactivation, or Base Closure. Involuntary extension of an OS tour may be requested for up to 180
  days by a member's commander or MAJCOM, or directed by HQ AFPC/CC, for only the following
  reasons: to meet immediate and critical operational needs (for example, to meet contingency require-
  ments of such urgency that STOP-LOSS has been implemented); to attend training or education when
  class start date does not reasonably coincide with the member's tour completion date; when the mem-
  ber is currently assigned to a unit being deactivated; or due to base closure. Requests must be initiated
  at least 90 days prior to the current DEROS and contain justification for the action requested including
  alternatives considered and why the alternatives are unsatisfactory. Include all pertinent information
  on member's status (selected for assignment or pending separation/retirement; status of dependents;
  household goods, etc.). Involuntary extension of DEROS will not extend a DOS or retirement date.
  Requests initiated by commanders are submitted through the servicing MPF to the member's parent
  MAJCOM. The MAJCOM must ensure the request is justified before forwarding to the assignment
  OPR for final decision by HQ AFPC/CC. Voluntary extension should be solicited before involuntary
  extension.

      3.10.6. Retention OS Without Involuntary DEROS Extension. For the following reasons, members
      who are retained in place as ineligible, not qualified, or prohibited from departing on PCS, do not
      require involuntary DEROS extension. The current DEROS is allowed to expire, unless the member
      voluntarily extends his or her DEROS according to paragraph 3.8.6.
         3.10.6.1. Member is not medically cleared for PCS (AAC 31 or 37).
         3.10.6.2. Member has been placed on International Hold (AAC 13).
         3.10.6.3. Member is serving a confinement sentence OS as a result of court-martial or civil court
         action (Duty Status Codes 04, 05, 16, 17, 56, and 59).

3.11. Tour Proration. OS tour proration recognizes OS service at one location in proportion to OS ser-
vice at another location with a different tour length. Proration for TDY is an AF policy, not a DoD
requirement. Proration in conjunction with PCS is an AF policy, except DoD may authorize or direct pro-
ration in some instances in conjunction with a change of OS tour length affecting members currently
assigned. When proration is authorized (and not prohibited, see paragraph 3.2.), a member’s current OS
tour (DEROS) could either be lengthened or shortened depending on the circumstances. Proration may be
based on TDY to an OS location where the tour length is less than the tour length at the member’s OS per-
manent duty station; when reassigned PCS to another OS location with a different tour length before com-
pleting the full prescribed OS tour at the initial location; when a tour length is changed at the member’s
duty station during a member’s OS tour; or as directed by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1. Proration may be sus-
pended or an individual request disapproved when approval does not serve the best interests of the AF.
Airmen serving an OTEIP extension (AAC 77) are not eligible for tour proration.
      3.11.1. Proration Based on TDY. For this type proration, a member must perform 60 or more consec-
      utive days TDY to an OS location where either the accompanied or unaccompanied tour length is less
      than either the accompanied or unaccompanied tour length at their permanent duty station as
      explained in Table 3.1. If the TDY location tour length is not listed in Table 3.1., contact HQ AFPC/
      DPAPP1 for the appropriate tour length. Table 1.13. contains the proration formula and several exam-
      ples are provided in the footnotes to assist in understanding the process. EXCEPTION: Proration for
      TDY is not authorized for members assigned to Alaska or Hawaii at locations where both the accom-
      panied and unaccompanied tour lengths are 36 months when TDY is to a location where the accompa-
      nied tour length is 36 months and the unaccompanied tour length is 24 months. The specific amount
      of proration is computed according to the instructions in Table 3.13. Proration based on TDY is not
      automatic and must be requested by the member upon return from a qualifying TDY and be approved
      by the assignment OPR. Proration for TDY that results in a DEROS within the OS cycle (for airmen
      see Attachment 16, paragraph A16.5., allocation column, or for officers an ASD as shown in Table
      2.8.) is not authorized. (NOTE: For airmen, the cycle referred to is the OS allocation cycle, not the
      OS returnee cycle.) When the authorized amount of proration results in a DEROS within the OS allo-
      cation cycle for airmen or an ASD for officers, then an alternate amount of tour proration which
      results in a DEROS outside the OS allocation cycle or for officers which does not result in an ASD
      may be approved by the assignment OPR. Whenever possible, planning for TDYs between locations
      with different tour lengths and selection of personnel to perform TDY should consider both the impact
      of proration on the mission and the benefit members may derive from proration.
      3.11.2. Proration Based on PCS or Tour Length Change. When a member is reassigned to an OS
      location with a different tour length than the one currently being served, or a tour length is changed
      and the implementation date affects members currently assigned, then the OS tour will normally be
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 189


   prorated (longer or shorter) unless the individual assignment instructions or tour length implementa-
   tion guidance affords the member options or prohibits proration. For example, implementation guid-
   ance for a change of current tour from a shorter to longer tour may contain the option for members
   currently assigned to retain the current (shorter) tour or voluntarily serve the longer tour, or it may
   require serving the longer tour as mandatory, or may stipulate proration from the shorter to the longer
   tour. Usually, a tour length change effective date is far enough in advance to allow members already
   assigned, or en route, to serve the existing tour length. Members who are to serve the new tour length
   will be selected for PCS based on their eligibility for the new tour length. Proration of DEROS to less
   than 6 months remaining is not authorized when a tour length change occurs and the member will
   remain in place, unless an exception is granted by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1. This allows adequate time for
   all action related to PCS to occur in a timely manner. When tour length will change due to PCS, the
   member will not be reassigned OS if serving a tour of 18 months or more. The procedure to determine
   the amount of proration for these reasons is outlined in Table 3.13.

3.12. Medal of Honor Recipients and Candidates. Members who are recipients, or who have been rec-
ommended for award of the Medal of Honor by their group or higher command will not be assigned to
duty OS in a hostile fire or imminent danger area without the member’s consent. On receipt of the direc-
tive awarding, or correspondence recommending award of the Medal of Honor to a member, the MPF
advises the assignment OPR by message for assignment disposition. Include the member's assignment
preferences. The assignment OPR immediately issues instructions reassigning the member, or takes
action to cancel a projected assignment to a designated hostile fire or imminent danger area as shown in
the DoD Pay and Allowances Manual. Recipients of the Medal of Honor will have assignment limitation
code "E" entered in PDS. A member may request waiver of this assignment restriction by sending a
request to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1. File approved waivers in Section III of the member's UPRG until separa-
tion or retirement.

3.13. Citizenship Considerations (Non-US Citizens and Dual Citizenship).
   3.13.1. Security Access for Non-US Citizens. In general, an AF member who is a non-US citizen is
   ineligible to be granted security access. Accordingly, these members may not be selected for assign-
   ment to any position in the CONUS or OS requiring security access. For guidance on assigning a
   non-US citizen with a TAFMSD prior to 1 Nov 82 to a position requiring security access (for example,
   the member may have been the subject of a previous background investigation and may be eligible
   for security access), consult AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program Management.
   3.13.2. OS Assignment Eligibility of Non-US or Dual Citizens.
       3.13.2.1. Officers. All commissioned officers must be a US citizen. However, for OS assignment
       of officers who hold dual citizenship or if their dependents are non-US citizens, then comply with
       paragraph 3.9.3.11.4.1.
       3.13.2.2. Airmen. Non-US citizens with a TAFMSD of 1 Nov 82 and more recent are not
       assigned OS (except to Alaska and Hawaii). In addition to the considerations in paragraph 3.13.3.,
       not assigning non-US citizens OS allows these members the opportunity to obtain US naturaliza-
       tion which is required for reenlistment eligibility. Further, a non-US citizen may not be eligible
       for entry into a third country because of agreements between the member's native country and the
       third country. Notwithstanding paragraph 3.13.3. and the concern for reenlistment eligibility,
       should assignment OS be deemed essential, regardless of TAFMSD, then comply with paragraph
190                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


         3.13.3. below. Also, before authorizing any non-US citizen or their dependents to proceed OS, the
         provisions of DoD Regulation 1000.21, DoD Passport and Passport Agent Services, must be met.
         3.13.2.3. To preserve the best interest of the AF and to protect its members and their dependents,
         members may request release from assignment to a foreign country of which they are citizens or
         are former citizens, or to a country where their dependents are citizens or former citizens. The
         request must be submitted to the MPF after official notification of assignment and the MPF will
         immediately reclama the assignment. The decision to cancel an assignment under these circum-
         stances will be made by the assignment OPR and be based on various factors (volunteer status,
         sufficient time to select replacement, and so on). When a request based on dependents is disap-
         proved, the member may be required to remain on assignment to serve the unaccompanied tour
         depending on the individual circumstances.
      3.13.3. OS Assignment of Persons Holding Dual Citizenship or Non-US Citizens. Citizenship is the
      relationship between a person and a country under which the person owes allegiance and is entitled to
      protection by the country. The laws of each nation determine who are its citizens. Differences in the
      citizenship and nationality laws of the nations of the world can result in dual citizenship; that is, two
      or more nations claiming the same person as its citizen. Dual citizenship most frequently occurs when
      a person changes his or her citizenship by naturalization or is born in one country of parents who are
      citizens of another country. Persons possessing dual citizenship may have legal obligations to both
      countries and persons who are non-US citizens may have legal obligations to their native country,
      including the obligation to pay foreign income taxes, serve in a foreign military service, liability for
      import taxes on household goods or POV, they might be restricted from departure by emigration laws,
      and so on. In most cases, enforcement of these obligations is attempted only if the individual enters
      the territorial boundaries of the other country. In the absence of an agreement, the US government
      cannot assert a legal objection to a foreign government applying, within its own territorial boundaries,
      its internal laws to persons qualifying as citizens under its laws. This is true even though the individ-
      ual may also be a US citizen under US law and be serving in the US Armed Forces. The member and
      the assignment OPRs must be aware of those circumstances, especially when humanitarian assign-
      ment is being requested or whenever an exchange or SWAP of assignments is requested.
         3.13.3.1. Actions Required. A member who is a US citizen and also holds citizenship in another
         country (dual citizenship) or a member who is not a US citizen, will not be assigned to the foreign
         country where citizenship is held unless approval is granted by the MAJCOM having OS jurisdic-
         tion. A request for approval of assignment is required to allow review of the Status of Forces
         Agreement (SOFA) and to determine other legal ramifications (such as, would the foreign govern-
         ment choose to hold the member to any of the obligations mentioned above). NOTE: A request
         must also be processed when a member is selected for reassignment to a location where an accom-
         panied tour is authorized and his or her dependents are non-US or dual citizens Failure to obtain
         approval may have serious consequences. The requirement for this review and approval will
         not be waived. The request must include the following information and is forwarded by the mem-
         ber's servicing MPF directly to the OS MAJCOM/DPX/DPA:
             3.13.3.1.1. Name, grade, SSN, and AFSC.
             3.13.3.1.2. Gaining unit, AAN, and RNLTD.
             3.13.3.1.3. Country of citizenship.
             3.13.3.1.4. Whether or not member has applied for US citizenship.

         3.13.3.1.5. Date and point of entry into the US.
         3.13.3.1.6. Alien dependents of member and relationship.
         3.13.3.1.7. Record of any courts-martial.
         3.13.3.1.8. Previous assignment to country of which member holds citizenship.
         3.13.3.1.9. Names and addresses of relatives residing in the country of which the member is a
         citizen.
         3.13.3.1.10. Country of citizenship of member's natural parents.
  3.13.4. MAJCOM Actions. On receipt of a request, the OS MAJCOM, after consulting with the
  appropriate AF command within the proposed country of assignment, determines whether any legal or
  community relations problems exist that could make the assignment objectionable. In particular,
  whether the member (or dependents) would be subject to the draft laws of the country, restricted from
  departure by emigration laws, and so on, or if factors exist that would present a high risk to continued
  AF service. The OS MAJCOM/DPX (or equivalent) coordinates with the MAJCOM Judge Advocate,
  approves or disapproves the request, and returns it directly to the originating MPF. When assignment
  of a member is disapproved, the MPF immediately reclamas the assignment citing the circumstances
  for assignment disqualification. When the denial is based on a member's dependents, the member
  may remain on the assignment to serve the unaccompanied tour.

NOTES:
     1. Use this table with paragraph 3.2. OS Tour Lengths, which addresses tour length exceptions
        by category.
         2.       For this table only, the abbreviation NA means "not authorized."
         3.     Accompanied tour and command-sponsorship of dependents permitted only when govern-
              ment family quarters or government approved family quarters and support facilities are avail-
              able to the individual.
         4.     Aircrew members (accompanied or unaccompanied) serve a 36-month tour plus the length
              of in-country training if assignment is to the NATO AWACS E-3A Component as follows:
              Officers in AFSC 11SX, 12RX, and 13BX; and airmen in AFSCs 1A1X1, 1A3X0, 1A4X0,
              1A5X0, 1A5X2 and 1A5X3.
         5.     The tour length change for Greece from 36/24 to 24/15 was effective 16 Jun 93. The tour
              length for members assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency and Defense Security Assis-
              tance Agency in Athens Greece remains 36 months accompanied and 24 months unaccompa-
              nied.
         6.    Not all service members are eligible to serve an accompanied tour in those locations where
              such tours are authorized. Eligibility is contingent upon the member's actual duty assignment
              as determined by US Forces Korea. For assignment purposes, those not offered to serve the
              accompanied tour (or those offered a CSPL position who elect the unaccompanied tour) are
              considered to be serving a dependent-restricted unaccompanied tour.
         7.     The tour length for Panama changed to NA/12 for Air Force personnel arriving 1 Mar 98 or
              later for assignment to the following units: 24th Wing and associated units; 640th Air Mobility
              Squadron; AF Legal Services Agency; Det 214, 2nd Field Investigation Unit, and those
              assigned at Ft. Clayton and Ft. Sherman.

NOTES:
     1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 3.3.

            Table 3.14.
       3.     (Officers only) At least 5 years must pass since last short tour before a nonvolunteer is eligi-
            ble for another short tour (compute 5 years from STRD of last short tour to projected depar-
            ture date for next short tour). AFPC/DPA may waive this restriction.

NOTES:
     1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraphs 3.4. and 3.5.
       2. Time creditable as OS duty for TDY begins the day of departure from the CONUS port
          excluding all leave, hospitalization, and other non-mission periods.

      3. Adjustment or award of the ODSD or STRD does not change a member's date arrived station.
      4. The number of days served in TDY status to qualify for award of a new ODSD/STRD is not
         the same as a member in PCS status whose OS tour is curtailed (see Table 3.4.).
      5. The only source document to be used to validate OS TDY is a copy of the paid travel voucher
         for each TDY claimed.
      6. Credit for 2 days or more TDY began on 5 Jan 95. For TDYs prior to this date you must have
         served a cumulative total or 90 or more days in a consecutive 3 year period to earn an adjust-
         ment to the ODSD/STRD.
      7. PDS update will use country code "ZT" with a tour length of number of days served.
      8. Members who are officially categorized via DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty, receive
         credit for at least one short tour, regardless of the length of time served OS. Additional short
         tour credit is awarded in 12 month increments, and any portion thereof, at the time of release/
         return to US control.
      9. Use HQ AFPC/DPAPP correspondence as the source document. Countries comprising the
         AOR are: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Bahrain, Qatar,
         Yemen, Turkey, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria, and the airspace and adjacent waters of these
         countries.
      10. For OS tour crediting purposes, for this TDY only, begin credit with the day of arrival in the
          AOR and end with the day of departure from the AOR.

NOTES:
     1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 3.8.6. Commanders may not disapprove a volun-
        tary extension request based solely on a member’s assignment OS for an arbitrary maximum
        period of time. However, commanders may disapprove extension requests based on a require-
        ment for fresh expertise or for reasons such as job stress, personal or family hardship, lack of
        adequate medical or educational facilities, etc.
       2. Normal voluntary DEROS extension criteria do not apply to a member’s request for change of
          OS tour status from unaccompanied to accompanied. Approval of command sponsorship and
          change of OS tour status requires the member to serve the accompanied tour length. There-
          fore, the DEROS change action is an adjustment of DEROS as shown in Table 3.9. (not a vol-
          untary extension action), also see Attachment 20.
       3. Travel restriction date (TRD) is six weeks after estimated delivery date (EDD). Establish new
          DEROS as one day after TRD. If new DEROS is 60 days or less from old DEROS, the instal-
          lation commander may approve extension. If new DEROS exceeds 60 days from old
          DEROS, forward request to the assignment OPR. In the case of military couples, the installa-
          tion commander may approve up to a 60 calendar day extension of tour for both members as
          long as the new DEROS of both members is within the same month. The commander must

         notify the MPF immediately so they can make the necessary changes to DEROS and other
         adjusted suspenses.
      4. Officers desiring to extend their OS tours beyond a cumulative 3 years in short tour areas
         (tours equal to or less than 24/15 months) or 6 years in long tour areas (tours greater then 24/
         15 months) must have at least the approval of both the wing commander (or equivalent) and
         the MAJCOM/DP. Officers desiring to extend beyond these cumulative periods may request
         extensions not greater than 12 months at a time.

     2. Systematic rotation is only for the purpose of spreading the rotation dates for members pos-
        sessing like skills over a greater period of time to ensure continuity of operation.
     3. Travel restriction date (TRD) is six weeks prior to Estimated Delivery Date (EDD). Establish
        the RNLTD to gaining unit as one day prior to TRD. Compute new DEROS by subtracting a
        maximum of 45 days (leave and travel time) from the new RNLTD. If new DEROS exceeds
        60 days from old DEROS, forward a curtailment request. In the case of military couples, the
        installation commander may only approve curtailment of the pregnant member. Submit a
        request to curtail the male military member, depending on period of curtailment. Enlisted
        members who have extension to OS tour approved under the OTEIP are not eligible for cur-
        tailment except for pregnant members at dependent-restricted locations. These members may
        extend their DEROS beyond the TRD or request early return of (civilian) spouse. The com-
        mander must immediately notify the MPF so they can make the necessary changes to DEROS
        and other suspenses.
     4. See paragraph 3.9.
     5. Request for CONUS assignment is sent by electrical message to the HQ AFPC OPR responsi-
        ble for member’s AFSC (see Table 1.2.) with information copy to AFLSA/JAJM, Bolling
        AFB DC. Request must include date confinement will end and home of record.
     6. See paragraph 2.48. Curtailment as a result of surplus based on promotion permitted only
        when the promotion is to the grade of CMSgt or Colonel.
     7. The parent MAJCOM may approved cancellation (provided it is not an OTEIP extension) if
        the new DEROS will not place the airman in the OS cycle (see Attachment 16 paragraph
        A16.5. allocations column) and for officers, the new DEROS must not result in an ASD which
        is past (seeTable 2.8., rule 3 for ASD schedule). This does not apply to an airman serving an
        extended long tour unless cancellation requested is to an extension of the ELT. Requests
        involving OTEIP extensions must be submitted to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 as exceptions accord-
        ing to paragraph 1.5.
     8. As requested by installation commander.

NOTES:
     1. This table must be used in conjunction with paragraph 3.11.
       2. To determine if the TDY location tour length is less than the member’s PCS location tour
          length, compare the accompanied and unaccompanied tour lengths at both locations as shown
222                                               AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


         in Table 3.1. If the tour lengths for the accompanied and unaccompanied tours at the two
         locations are the same, then proration is not authorized. For example, if the TDY location tour
         length is 36/24 and the member’s PCS location tour length is 36/24, then the member is not
         TDY to a location with a tour length less than his or her permanent duty station. Airmen
         Only: Do not use the extended long OS tour length. EXCEPTION: Proration for TDY is not
         authorized for members assigned to Alaska or Hawaii at locations where both the accompa-
         nied and unaccompanied tour lengths are 36 months when TDY is to a location where the
         accompanied tour length is 36 months and the unaccompanied tour length is 24 months.

         Here are several more examples:
         a. If the permanent duty station tour length is 24/15 and the TDY location tour length is 24/
            12, then proration is authorized. Use the unaccompanied tour length of 12 months at the
            TDY location for proration computation. A member serving a 24 month accompanied
            tour is prorated using the 12 month TDY location tour and a member serving the 15 month
            unaccompanied tour at the same location is also prorated using the 12 month TDY loca-
            tion tour, but the length of the proration will not be the same.
         b. If the permanent duty station tour length is 30/18 and the TDY location tour length is 24/
            18, the proration is authorized, but proration would not affect a member serving an unac-
            companied tour of 18 months at their permanent duty station.
         c. If the permanent duty station tour length is 24/12 and the TDY location tour length is 24/
            15, then proration is not authorized. The basic criterion that the TDY location tour length
            must be less than the tour length at the permanent duty station is not met. Therefore, do
            not prorate the tour of a member serving a 24 month accompanied tour based on the unac-
            companied TDY location tour length of 15 months.
      3. When it is determined the TDY location tour length is less than the member’s PCS location
         tour length, then for proration computation purposes, use the TDY location unaccompanied
         tour length from Table 3.1. If the TDY location is not listed in Table 3.1., contact HQ AFPC/
         DPAPP1 for the appropriate tour length.
      4. Compute the prorated DEROS as follows: Provided the member meets the requirements of
         column A, use columns B and C to determine the correct proration factor from column D.
         Multiply the number of days TDY by the proration factor to determine the number of days
         proration. The final step is to subtract the number of days proration from the member's cur-
         rent DEROS to determine the prorated DEROS. For example, SMSgt Stine is serving an
         accompanied tour at a 36/24 location and has a current DEROS of 991122. He performs 79
         days TDY at an OS location which has a tour length of 24/15. To find the amount of prora-
         tion, determine the proration factor from column D. For SMSgt Stine, it is 1.4. Multiply the
         number of days TDY (79) by the proration factor (1.4) to determine the number of days prora-
         tion (79 x 1.4 = 110.6 (round to the nearest whole number, .5 or higher, round up; .4 or lower,
         round down). The final step in the computation is to subtract the number of days proration
         (111) from the current DEROS to find the prorated DEROS. This can be easily done by con-
         verting the current DEROS to the appropriate Julian date, and then subtracting the number of
         days proration. SMSgt Stine's DEROS of 991122 is Julian date 326. Subtracting 111 from
         326 equals 215. Julian date 215 is 3 August; therefore, SMSgt Stine's prorated DEROS is
         990803.

     5. For one day or more service in a month, count the whole month.
     6. Use DAS for PCS, or effective date of tour length change as new tour start date.

NOTE:
Use this table for airmen. Apply it to officers when other eligibility and qualification factors are equal or
similar enough and you need to determine the order to match officers against requirements. Within each
priority group, match members currently serving a short tour who voluntarily extended their tour for a
period of 6 or more months, or members currently serving a long tour who voluntarily extended their tour
for a period of 12 or more months beyond their original DEROS, ahead of other members within the same
priority group. Additionally, each month voluntarily extended beyond the minimum 6 or 12 month period
raises the member's priority within their priority group. In the event of a tie within a priority group, indi-
viduals will be matched in the following order:
   Grade (highest grade takes precedence;
   Date of Rank (DOR)(earliest date takes precedence;
   Total Active Federal Commissioned Service Date (TAFCSD)(Officers only)(earliest date takes
   precedence);
   Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD)(earliest date takes precedence;
   Date of Birth (DOB)(earliest date takes precedence);
   Reverse Social Security Number (SSN) order (use all 9 digits and lowest number takes prece-
   dence). FOR EXAMPLE, if the SSN is 123 45 6789 as a normal number it would be 123,456,789,
   and reversed it would be 987,654,321.

                                                  Chapter 4

                             TEMPORARY DUTY (TDY) ASSIGNMENT

4.1. Purpose of TDY. This instruction authorizes personnel to be temporarily assigned to perform duty
at a location other than their permanent duty station for manning assistance as described, and for duty for
the administrative reasons shown. It prescribes policies, procedures, restrictions, and guidance for selec-
tion and effective management of personnel for TDY for these reasons only. TDY manning assistance
may be used to satisfy one-time operational manning requirements of short duration or to satisfy
long-term operational manning requirements on a temporary basis while PCS arrangements are com-
pleted. Administrative TDY is used only for official military reasons to advise or participate in such
activities as briefings, lectures, staff assistance, meetings, conferences, or to attend a course of instruction
of less than 20 weeks. Before directing TDY, officials must be convinced TDY is essential and the results
will pay back the AF for the cost of the TDY. Further, the cost in terms of unit, member, and family tur-
bulence associated with TDY must be considered and the TDY deemed essential to satisfy the needs of
the AF. TDY for other reasons, such as, to appear as a witness, for medical evaluation, and so on, is not
authorized under the authority of this instruction. The authority for that type TDY, funding authorization,
criteria for selection of people (if applicable), and so on, should be addressed in the instruction which
authorizes TDY for those purposes. TDY which is not authorized by this instruction or some other AF
instruction may be submitted for consideration as an exception according to paragraph 1.5. Exceptions
must be requested and the TDY approved in advance. Approval of TDY as an exception does not include
funding. The availability of funding may not be the sole basis for approval of TDY. TDY approved as an
exception is on the basis that TDY serves the best interests of the AF. TDY in accordance with this
instruction, including as an exception, cannot be authorized solely for personal reasons. Permissive TDY
is authorized and approved according to the criteria in AFI 36-3003, Military Leave. For contingency and
exercise TDY processing, refer to AFI 10-215, Personnel Support for Contingency Operations (PER-
SCO).

4.2. Delegation of Temporary Duty (TDY) Assignment Authority. TDY assignment authority for the
reasons above is decentralized and is hereby delegated to MAJCOMs, or equivalent. As used here, the
term equivalent includes the headquarters of Field Operating Agencies (FOA), Direct Reporting Units
(DRU), and the headquarters level of those other functions which have been assigned a MAJCOM Iden-
tity Code as shown in the USAF Personnel Accounting System (PAS) Directory. A MAJCOM (or equiv-
alent) may further delegate TDY authority down to and including squadron level. A MAJCOM (or
equivalent) may limit TDY authority it delegates. For example, a MAJCOM may limit locally originated
TDY to within the CONUS only, except TDY in support of an operation plan (OPLAN).

4.3. TDY Entitlements and Allowances. When a member is to be assigned for TDY at a location other
than his/her permanent duty station (regardless of the distance involved), the assistance of the servicing
Financial Services Officer (FSO) should be requested to determine if TDY entitlements and allowances
accrue to a member according to the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), and what the cost will be.
When members accrue TDY entitlements or allowances, that TDY is subject to the restrictions prescribed
by the JFTR and this instruction. When a member is directed to take an action for which an entitlement
or allowance is authorized by the JFTR, that action obligates the AF to pay or reimburse him or her if the
member makes a claim. When members accrue TDY entitlements or allowances in conjunction with
TDY, the JFTR requires TDY orders be issued to record the TDY. TDY orders are issued according to
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    227


AFI 37-128, Administrative Orders. Permissive TDY is authorized and approved according to the crite-
ria in AFI 36-3003, Military Leave.

4.4. When to Request PCS or Authorize TDY. When a MAJCOM (or equivalent) has an operational
mission which will exist at a specific location for more than 179 consecutive days, then consideration
should be given to establishing a permanent AF unit at that location, allocation of manpower authoriza-
tions and accomplishment of the mission by assignment of personnel in PCS status. It is recognized it is
not always possible to determine the exact length of time needed to accomplish a mission and sometimes
long-term TDY is necessary because PCS assignment to a location is not feasible. However, for person-
nel assignment planning purposes, the 179 day guideline will normally be used in determining which mis-
sions can be met via TDY and which should be satisfied on a PCS basis. NOTE: As a reminder, normally
before an assignment OPR can assign an AF member OS in PCS status, a Status of Forces Agreement
(SOFA) must exist (excluding PCS to Alaska, Hawaii, or a territory or possession of the U.S.), the OS
PCS tour length must be requested and approved per Chapter 3, an AF unit must be established with
manpower positions authorized, and other personnel support actions essential to permanent assignment of
US military personnel must be completed. When the prerequisites for PCS of personnel have been com-
pleted, then a MAJCOM (or equivalent) may request the assignment OPR assign personnel on a PCS
basis (see paragraphs 1.2., 2.8., and 3.8.).

4.5. Determining TDY or PCS to Attend a Course of Instruction. The following applies when a
member is to attend a course of instruction. Comptroller General Decision establishes that when a mem-
ber is to attend a course (or courses) of instruction of less than 20 calendar weeks, then attendance will be
in TDY status (use the duration of the course(s) as shown in AFCAT 36-2223, USAF Formal Schools at
any one location, or total duration of courses when attending two or more courses at the same location).
(EXCEPTION: Assign airmen graduating from basic training to school in PCS status if assigning them
directly to a technical school regardless of the course length.) The length of TDY must not exceed the
number of calendar days from the course reporting date to the final graduation date as shown in the quota
allocation, plus all allowable travel time. Conversely, when a member will attend a course (or courses) at
one location and the official length of the course(s) is 20 weeks or more, then the member will attend in
PCS status. When a member's attendance status is TDY, but he or she remains at a location for 20 weeks
or more (for example, if a member is required to repeat a block of training), the original attendance status
of TDY based on the course length is not changed from TDY to PCS. Similarly, when a member’s atten-
dance status is PCS based on the course length and he or she completes the course (or is eliminated) in less
than 20 weeks, the original attendance status of PCS is not changed to TDY. Upon determining atten-
dance will be in a TDY status, then see paragraph 2.26.5., Table 4.1., and paragraph 4.6. below.

4.6. TDY Restrictions. A number of the TDY assignment policies and procedures outlined in this
instruction have been established to specifically comply with, or to comply with the intent of, Comptroller
General Decisions or the JFTR. Erroneous payments to members (regardless of how the error occurred)
are normally recouped as soon as the error is discovered. Further, it is not always possible to correct
errors administratively when they involve allowances and entitlements. Accordingly, commanders at all
levels and officials responsible for directing and/or approving TDY must be familiar with and comply
with the restrictions established below. Individual members also have a personal responsibility to confirm
their entitlements and allowances through official sources such as their supporting FSO.
   4.6.1. Restriction on Consecutive Number of Days TDY to Any One Location. Comptroller General
   Decision B131145, 3 May 57, restricts members from being reimbursed for more than 179 consecu-
228                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      tive days TDY to any one location (travel time excluded), without Secretarial approval. Also see
      paragraph 4.6.2. for restriction on cumulative number of days TDY to the location. See paragraph
      4.6.3. for waiver requests.
      4.6.2. Restriction on Cumulative Number of Days TDY to Any One Location. In addition to the con-
      secutive days restriction in paragraph 4.6.1., SAF policy is a member will not be directed on TDY
      which will result in more than 179 days accumulation of TDY at any one location in a consecutive
      12-month period (regardless of the duty to be performed), without SAF approval or approval of the
      commander of a specified or unified command. This approval authority may not be further delegated.
      The consecutive 12-month period starts with the member's first TDY to a given site and is not based
      on calendar or fiscal year periods. Use 365 consecutive days to determine the "12-month" period.
      This policy is necessary to comply with the spirit and intent of Comptroller General Decision
      B165911, 4 Apr 69, which states a commander may not publish separate TDY orders returning a
      member to a TDY point after a "token return" to the permanent duty base. An example of token return
      would be the TDY of a member to a location for 179 consecutive days, return of the member to his or
      her permanent duty station for a day or so, and then again directing the member TDY back to the same
      location for another 179 consecutive days. The restriction in paragraph 4.6.1. together with the pro-
      hibition on token return, facilitates SAF review of continued TDY support of a program, project, or
      mission in lieu of establishing PCS authorizations. See paragraph 4.6.3. for requests for waivers.
      4.6.3. Requests for SAF Waivers. Requests for waivers (or exceptions) to the restrictions in para-
      graphs 4.6.1. and 4.6.2. are submitted as shown below. For waivers of paragraph 4.6.1. (more than
      179 consecutive days), the unit commander will initiate a waiver request and send it to the MPF. The
      MPF will review and send the request to the member's parent MAJCOM and include other addressees
      for information as appropriate. Requests must be submitted at least 45 days before the projected TDY
      start date or expiration of current TDY. Waivers are considered when uncontrollable circumstances
      develop and a requirement exists for a member to be TDY longer than 179 consecutive days. MAJ-
      COMs send waiver requests to AF/DPFJ for colonels (including selectees) and to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1
      for Lt Cols and below for forwarding to the SAF. For waivers of paragraph 4.6.2. (more than 179 days
      cumulative TDY to the same location in a 12-month period), either the member's home station unit
      commander or the TDY location commander may initiate a request. When the member's home station
      unit commander initiates the request, it is sent to the servicing MPF. The MPF will review and send
      the request through the member's parent MAJCOM. The parent MAJCOM sends waiver requests to
      HQ AFPC/DPAPP for forwarding to the SAF. When the request is initiated by the TDY location com-
      mander, it is forwarded according to instructions issued by the unified or specified command the TDY
      supports and may be approved by the commander of the unified or specified command. If the request
      is not submitted through unified or specified command channels, then the request may be sent to the
      member's home station commander for concurrence and submission to the MPF, the member's parent
      MAJCOM, and then to HQ AFPC/DPAPP for forwarding to the SAF.
         4.6.3.1. Date TDY began and date current TDY period ends (including any prior waivers).
         4.6.3.2. Justification for the TDY or additional TDY term.
         4.6.3.3. Number of additional days required and new TDY completion date.
         4.6.3.4. Volunteer status of member and commander's recommendation.
         4.6.3.5. A statement regarding any hardship the member may incur.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                229


  4.6.4. Restrictions on TDY In Conjunction With PCS. Comptroller General Decisions and the JFTR
  place some special restrictions on TDY of members who have also been selected for PCS. Accord-
  ingly, the AF has established a number of personnel management policies as outlined below to avoid
  TDY which could conflict with restrictions imposed. Requests for TDY en route PCS must be
  approved by the assignment OPR and the authority for funding of the TDY verified.
     4.6.4.1. TDY En Route at Current or New Duty Station. TDY at a member's current duty station
     (after signing out PCS), TDY at a member's new duty station (before signing in PCS), or TDY to
     a location in proximity to either the old or new duty station, will not be authorized as TDY en
     route PCS. There are no TDY entitlements or allowances when a TDY location is the same as a
     member's (old or new) permanent duty station and only minimal TDY entitlements and allow-
     ances authorized for duty at a location in proximity of a member's duty station (old or new).
     Therefore, the remarks section of the PCS orders may make mention of a TDY required in connec-
     tion with a member's PCS which is to be performed at, or in the vicinity of, the old or new duty
     station, but the TDY will not be directed as TDY en route PCS. TDY of this nature is performed
     before a member departs the current permanent duty station on PCS, or after arrival PCS at the
     member's new permanent duty station.
     4.6.4.2. PCS to the Same Location as TDY, or TDY to the Same Location as PCS. Whenever
     possible, the AF should avoid multiple entitlements and reimbursements for TDY when a member
     has also been selected for PCS to the same location. A member can be "selected for PCS to the
     same location" in two ways as explained below.
         4.6.4.2.1. PCS to the Same Location as TDY. When a member is performing TDY and is
         selected for PCS to the same location (regardless of the PCS reporting date), then, for entitle-
         ment purposes, upon selection for PCS the TDY station becomes the member's PCS station if
         there is no military duty requirement for the member to return to the old station. Returning to
         home station solely for the purpose of PCS out-processing is not considered a military duty
         requirement. However, when it is determined there is a military duty requirement for a mem-
         ber to return to the station from which TDY, then the member continues to be entitled to TDY
         allowances.
         4.6.4.2.2. Selected for PCS, Then Selected for TDY to the Same Location. When a member
         previously selected for PCS (regardless of the reporting date) is directed to the same location
         in a TDY status, then upon arrival TDY entitlements and allowances terminate and the mem-
         ber's status becomes PCS if the duties while TDY are the same as they would have been upon
         PCS completion. To preclude this from happening inadvertently, as a general policy, a mem-
         ber selected for PCS may not be issued TDY orders to the new permanent duty station when
         duties while TDY will be the same as those when PCS is completed. Alternatives include
         accelerating the member's PCS RNLTD or selecting someone else for the TDY. Exceptions
         may be requested per paragraph 1.5.
     4.6.4.3. TDY Not in Direct Support of a PCS. Normally, only TDY which directly supports a
     PCS will be authorized en route, regardless of the availability of funding. Authorizing TDY en
     route PCS for other reasons such as operational manning assistance, to participate in an exercise,
     and so on, can create unforeseen problems and hardships on members with regard to entitlements,
     pay and allowances, housing, arrangements for dependents, HHGs shipment and storage, SOFAs,
     and so on. Exceptions can be considered according to paragraph 1.5.
230                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


         4.6.4.4. TDY Cost Chargeable to MILPER PCS Account. According to AFI 65-601, Financial
         Management - Budget Guidance and Procedures, Volume 1, TDY to be charged to the MILPERS
         PCS Account must be performed en route PCS (not TDY and return), must not exceed 15 days
         (including travel time) and can be authorized only for the reasons shown below. Requests for
         TDY for other reasons (such as briefings, debriefing, orientation, and so on) will be funded by the
         requiring command's O&M funds. Requests for waivers or exceptions may be submitted by the
         MAJCOM (or equivalent) direct to SAF/FMBMD, and include as information addressees the
         assignment OPR and HQ AFPC/DPAPP1/DPAPP3. Authorization for funding of TDY en route
         PCS when the TDY is required by a DoD activity and is in direct support of PCS to (or from) the
         AF Element (AFELM) of a DoD activity, should be requested from 11WG/FMAP, Rosslyn VA.
         For TDY which meets the criteria in this paragraph for approval, HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 must coor-
         dinate on a case-by-case basis any request for TDY en route PCS when the TDY is to be charged
         to the MILPERS PCS Account.
             4.6.4.4.1. M-16 rifle training.
             4.6.4.4.2. Medical examination.
             4.6.4.4.3. Obtaining passports.
             4.6.4.4.4. In-processing or out-processing at the host base only when required by host/tenant
             agreement or SOFA. There are no PCS-related AF military personnel actions which require a
             member to perform TDY en route.
      4.6.5. Restrictions on Selection of Personnel for TDY and for PCS While TDY. TDY assignment
      selection authority is decentralized and may be delegated, however, this instruction prescribes a
      framework of restrictions and policies applicable to selection of personnel for TDY. When more than
      one person assigned is qualified and eligible, this instruction does not specify an order in which to
      select personnel for a specific kind or length of TDY. Commanders need a reasonable degree of flex-
      ibility to balance satisfying the needs of the AF with the impact TDY has on assigned personnel and
      their families. Commanders may establish additional criteria to ensure TDY selection of personnel
      they command is as fair and equitable as possible, all factors considered.
         4.6.5.1. Qualifications to Perform TDY. The primary consideration in selecting personnel for
         TDY is a member's qualifications to perform the TDY mission. For TDY to attend a course of
         instruction, selection is in accordance with guidance furnished for the specific training and to the
         degree practical, the guidance in this instruction. However, as in selection for PCS, there are a
         number of very important factors to be considered when selecting personnel for TDY. To the
         degree possible, involuntary TDY should be distributed equitably among members similarly qual-
         ified.
         4.6.5.2. Members Who Recently Completed a PCS or Pending PCS, Separation or Retirement.
         Table 4.2. establishes a minimum TOS for selection for TDY (other than for training), after PCS
         and before PCS and before separation (including retirement). Normally, members who have
         recently completed a PCS and those pending PCS or separation/retirement should not be sent
         TDY or permitted to remain on TDY, when the departure date or completion date is less than the
         minimums shown in Table 4.2. It is recognized that the minimums in Table 4.2. may not be ade-
         quate in all circumstances for all members. However, generally the minimums established pro-
         vide enough time for most members and most base agencies to take care of essential processing or
         other requirements. In some instances, essential processing or other actions may need to be com-
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                               231


     pleted via a power of attorney, by mail or message, or rescheduled on a priority basis due to mem-
     ber's absence on TDY. Authority to waive the established TOS minimums is delegated to the unit
     commander provided waiver will not interfere with the member meeting the RNLTD for a pro-
     jected PCS, or separation/retirement on the scheduled date. Members should be given the oppor-
     tunity to state if a hardship would be created as a result of a waiver and commanders should
     confirm with the MPF that all required PCS, separation or retirement actions can be accomplished.
     For example, a member who has no dependents and resides on-base in bachelor quarters may not
     require 30 days on station immediately preceding separation; or, a member scheduled to take 30
     days leave in conjunction with PCS may agree to reduce the number of days leave in order to
     remain on TDY for an additional period of time negating the requirement for TDY replacement;
     or, if necessary, a commander may disapprove delay en route in conjunction with a member's PCS
     in order to complete the TDY and still comply with the RNLTD for a projected PCS.
     4.6.5.3. Retainability. Normally, members who either possess sufficient service retainability or
     who are eligible to obtain retainability to complete the full period of TDY are selected. (NOTE:
     Officers with an indefinite DOS are viewed as having indefinite service retainability. Expiration
     of an officer's ADSC is not an established DOS or established retirement date.) Selection of mem-
     bers who have or can obtain retainability for the full period of TDY precludes having to replace
     members and reduces mission and family turbulence. However, when necessary, commanders
     may direct members to perform TDY within the amount of retainability they have. This includes
     officers who established a DOS under 7-day option provisions when notified of TDY selection,
     officers and airmen who established a retirement date under 7-day option provisions, and airmen
     who declined to obtain retainability for the full TDY period.
     4.6.5.4. TDY of Members Deferred For Humanitarian/EFMP Reasons. See Attachment 7 for
     guidance on selection of personnel for TDY who have approved humanitarian (AAC 30) or EFMP
     deferments (AAC 34 or ALC Q).
     4.6.5.5. Involuntary OS PCS Selection While TDY. While performing TDY under the circum-
     stances described herein, either TDY in the CONUS or OS, members should not normally be
     selected for involuntary OS PCS. In addition, following these kinds of TDY, members should not
     normally be selected for involuntary OS PCS selection with an RNLTD less than 120 days after
     TDY completion date. These provisions apply to members TDY OS and reflected in the PDS in
     DSC 20, 21 and 25, and members TDY in the CONUS participating in a contingency, rotational or
     exercise TDY and reflected in the PDS in DSC 20. They do not apply to individuals selected for
     a voluntary assignment (CONUS or OS), involuntary CONUS PCS, or TDY for reasons (DSC)
     other than those listed. MPFs will reclama PCS selection and/or a reporting date contrary to these
     provisions (see paragraph 4.6.3. above for what to include in the reclama). When necessary in the
     best interests of the AF, HQ AFPC/DPA may waive these provisions.
     4.6.5.6. PCS Selection While TDY and Member Requests Hardship Consideration. Any PCS
     selection (voluntary or involuntary) while TDY can at times impose a hardship on members.
     Members who are TDY who have a hardship as a result of PCS selection may request a change of
     RNLTD or assignment cancellation through their unit commander to the MPF. The MPF will for-
     ward the request to the assignment OPR, with an information copy to the member's parent MAJ-
     COM and gaining MAJCOM. The request must include the specific details of the hardship, date
     notified of PCS selection, the reason for TDY and Duty Status Code (DSC), operation/exercise
     name (if applicable), location (if unclassified), inclusive dates of TDY, date of selection for TDY

         and date notified, volunteer status for TDY, and whether or not the DSC was updated in the PDS
         at the time of PCS selection. The assignment OPR will evaluate the request and take action as
         appropriate. Approval of member's request is not automatic. The assignment OPR may approve,
         disapprove or take action other than that requested by the member depending on the circum-
         stances.

4.7. Intracommand Manning Assistance TDY. Intracommand manning assistance is TDY between
units of the same command met from that command's resources. Intracommand manning assistance is
managed according to guidance in this instruction and guidance issued by the parent MAJCOM.

4.8. Intercommand Manning Assistance TDY. Intercommand manning assistance is HQ AFPC-con-
trolled TDY that requires personnel from the units of one command to support units of another command
either in the CONUS or OS. Manning assistance TDY will not be used to assist units when absences are
due to administrative TDY.
There are five types of intercommand manning assistance as described below. The types may be referred
to in general by the nicknames shown, but all intercommand manning assistance requests will be assigned
a unique control number called a plan identification (PID) number. See paragraph 4.9. for information on
PID construction and paragraph 4.10. for how to request manning assistance.
      4.8.1. Normal - Nickname PALACE TRIP. Intercommand TDY of personnel for brief periods to
      another AF unit to assist that unit in performance of its home base mission. Any intercommand man-
      ning assistance request not included in the description of one of other types can be submitted as a
      PALACE TRIP request.
      4.8.2. Contingency - Nickname PALACE BLITZ. TDY deployment in support of actual contin-
      gency operations. The organization with operational responsibility for the contingency will request
      manning assistance using procedures outlined in AFI 10-215. Personnel requirements must be made
      known as soon as possible. As requirements are validated, the operational command/DP will provide
      all specific details in their request.
      4.8.3. Rotational Contingency - Nickname PALACE TENURE. TDY deployments which support
      requirements where a changeover or rotation of members is required to sustain operations. These
      projects are the result of long term manpower needs for which PCS of personnel is not appropriate.
      PALACE TENURE support is requested and managed as outlined in AFI 10-215.
      4.8.4. Exercise - Nickname PALACE EXERCISE. TDY deployment that supports HQ
      USAF-directed or JCS-directed/sponsored exercises. The supported MAJCOM must request assis-
      tance not later than 45 calendar days prior to the earliest required in-place date using procedures in
      AFI 10-215. Requests with less than 45 calendar days must be signed by a general officer and
      addressed to HQ USAF/XOO for sourcing consideration.
      4.8.5. Special - Nickname PALACE ENVOY. TDY deployment that supports unique geographical/
      political missions as directed by HQ USAF (i.e., United Nations missions, Department of Justice,
      etc.).

4.9. Intercommand Manning Assistance Plan Identification (PID) Number Construction. E a c h
intercommand manning assistance request is assigned a PID (whether or not the requirement supports an
operation plan [OPLAN]). The PID is an alpha-numeric code used to describe and track a TDY require-
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    233


ment and is assigned by AFGOMO, AFCMO, HQ AFPC/DPW or the requesting command. For manning
assistance the first position is a constant "F." Positions two through four are numeric and denote the spe-
cific kind of manning assistance as shown below. The last two positions are the two-character command
code of the supported command (see BLPS table 472) and are reflected as "XX" below. For example, PID
F00209 means manning assistance (F) to satisfy a brief workload surge (002) in support of HQ AFPC
(09). Contingency and exercise PIDs are provided by the supported command. Other PIDs are con-
structed as follows:
   4.9.1. Unit Manpower Document (UMD) Shortage, PID F001XX.
   4.9.2. Brief Workload Surge, PID F002XX.
   4.9.3. Backfill-Intracommand, PID F003XX. When need is brought on by an exercise or contingency
   move of command resources.
   4.9.4. Backfill-Intercommand, PID F004XX. When need is brought on by an exercise or contingency
   move of a command's resources to assist another command.
   4.9.5. Base Closure or Unit Deactivation, PID F005XX.
   4.9.6. Special Project Training, Technical Assistance or Mobile Training Team, PID F006XX.
   4.9.7. Special Geographical/Political Missions, PID F007XX.

4.10. How to Request Intercommand Manning Assistance TDY Support. Intercommand manning
assistance requests must be submitted by message in the format below to AFGOMO for general officers
(including brigadier general selects), to AFCMO (for colonels, including selects), to HQ AFPC/DPAM
for medical officers (Lt Col and below), and HQ AFPC/DPWRM for all other officers and airmen. Con-
tingency and exercise requests must be submitted as outlined in AFI 10-215.
   4.10.1. Plan Identification Number (PID). Construct as outlined in paragraph 4.9.
   4.10.2. Purpose of TDY. For example, "Brief Workload Surge."
   4.10.3. Requirements. Number of officers/airmen required by AFSC and a brief description of actual
   duties to be performed, special experience or qualifications, currency required (for example, if the
   requirement is for a specific kind of pilot indicate if member must be current in a specific aircraft).
   4.10.4. Justification. Provide current and project command manning statistics for the AFSCs
   requested: authorized, assigned and available. Include mission impact and reason assigned personnel
   are not available, that is, other deployments, medically disqualified, etc.
   4.10.5. Requested reporting date. Reporting date should be at least 30 days after submission of
   request.
   4.10.6. Number of days TDY required (including travel time).
   4.10.7. Servicing MPF PAS code and duty location.
   4.10.8. Variation in Itinerary required, yes or no. If yes, include justification.
   4.10.9. Required aerial port of embarkation (APOE) or debarkation (APOD), if applicable.
   4.10.10. Any additional instructions, e.g., specific reporting time and place, billeting, field conditions
   applicability, tools and equipment requirements, uniform requirements, etc.

      4.10.11. Funding Instructions.
      4.10.12. Statement that requested TDY has been approved or coordinated on by MAJCOM/DP (or
      SG for TDY of medical officers). For special or joint activities, unit director of personnel must
      approve TDY request. Failure to obtain approval/coordination could result in a delay in processing
      the manning assistance request until confirmation of approval/coordination. Intercommand manning
      assistance should be requested only after all other options have been considered. Manning assistance
      deployment is usually an unprogrammed loss to the parent unit and command and special care must be
      given to ensure these TDYs are in the best interests of the Air Force.
      4.10.13. Name, grade, office symbol and telephone number of the requesting organization's point of
      contact (POC).

4.11. How to Request Release from Tasking. MAJCOMs (or equivalent) may establish guidelines for
subordinate units which supplement those herein.
      4.11.1. Requests for release from tasking must be submitted by message to the tasking authority. For
      a tasking received 30 calendar days or less from the required reporting, a release request must be sub-
      mitted within two calendar days of receipt of the tasking. For a tasking received 31 or more calendar
      days from the required reporting, a release request must be submitted within five calendar days of
      receipt.
      4.11.2. Include mission impact statement and reason assigned personnel are not available. Include
      current/projected manning by AFSC as of the date required in-place (DRI), percent not available by
      category, such as, currently deployed, medically disqualified, pending PCS departure, projected
      approved retirement/separation, and so on.

4.12. TDY Orders. Commanders ensure TDY orders are issued as shown in AFI 37-128. Per paragraph
4.4., orders are required per the JFTR when members accrue TDY entitlements or allowances. For per-
sonnel accounting purposes, MAJCOMs (or equivalent) will direct that functions which issue orders
directing the TDY of Air Force personnel make sure the parent MPF relocations element and/or employ-
ment readiness element get distribution of orders or are informed of the specifics of the TDY when orders
are not available. Unless firm departure and reporting dates to the TDY location are directed, command-
ers determine these dates. Members must not arrive prior to the date they are needed consistent with
availability of transportation. For TDY to training courses, members are normally directed not to arrive
more than 1 day prior to the class start date. When the course ends, the member departs as directed in
orders or as determined by the school commander.

4.13. TDY to HQ USAF. Members may be placed on TDY to HQ USAF agencies after approval is
granted by the interested staff office. Approval by the appropriate staff office will provide the name and
location of the office to which the member is to report. The address symbol and location is shown in TDY
orders.

4.14. Country Clearance for OS TDY. Official TDY visits to locations in foreign countries outside the
CONUS must be cleared in advance with United States authorities who have jurisdiction in the area. Usu-
ally this clearance is requested 30 calendar days in advance of the proposed departure date. DoD
4500.54-G, Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide, shows the clearance requirements and con-
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  235


trols on travel outside the CONUS. Personnel who will perform TDY must read the applicable portions
of the guide or be briefed on its content by personnel processing members for TDY.

4.15. Variation in Itinerary. An authorization for variation in itinerary permits the omission of travel to
any place stated in the travel order and grants changes in the order of places shown as necessary to accom-
plish the mission. Usually the purpose of a trip and places of TDY are known at the time a travel order is
published. The authorization for variation in itinerary does not take the place of good planning. This
authority is not to be read as granting blanket travel authorization.

4.16. Funding of TDY. The guidelines for funding of manning assistance TDY (not in conjunction with
PCS) are contained in AFI 65-601. For funding of TDY for training, see AFCAT 36-2223 or the training
instructions. For funding of TDY en route in conjunction with a PCS, see paragraph 4.6.4.4. For PAL-
ACE TENURE and PALACE BLITZ TDY, the tasked (losing) unit's O&M funds will be used unless
the tasking message provides other funding instructions. For PALACE ENVOY, funding will be speci-
fied in the implementing instructions. For PALACE EXERCISE and PALACE TRIP TDY, funding
will be furnished by the requesting MAJCOM.

4.17. TDY “Hold” for Members En Route PCS. Members en route between permanent duty stations
may be placed on official TDY (often referred to as TDY “hold”) when they are directed for official rea-
sons by the assignment OPR to discontinue travel pending further orders. Commanders or other officials
who desire to place members en route PCS in official TDY status must obtain advance approval from HQ
AFPC/DPAPP. This does not mean that HQ AFPC/DPAPP has approval authority in all cases, but rather
this office will determine if TDY or some other action is appropriate and then request approval from the
appropriate authority depending on the circumstances. Normally, this kind of TDY is intended for use
when, based on change in manning requirements, change in required qualifications or similar
assignment related reasons, members should neither return to their former permanent duty station nor
proceed to the new permanent duty station. In such cases a decision on the member’s assignment can usu-
ally be made by the assignment OPR within several days. When the reason to place a member on official
TDY en route PCS is other than assignment related (for example, based on a natural disaster, political
unrest, or other reasons), TDY must be requested and approved as an exception and a funding determina-
tion obtained (see paragraph 4.6.4.4.).
   4.17.1. When appropriate authority requests a member who is en route PCS not be allowed to con-
   tinue travel as planned to the new permanent duty station nor should the member return to the former
   permanent duty station, or in other circumstances as an exception, the official or his or her designated
   representative must submit a request by the most expeditious means to HQ AFPC/DPAPP for consid-
   eration. The request must include the following:
       4.17.1.1. Member’s name, grade, SSN and projected DAFSC.
       4.17.1.2. Previous unit of assignment and location.
       4.17.1.3. Projected unit of assignment, location, port call (if applicable), and RNLTD.
       4.17.1.4. Reason the requesting official requests the member should not return to previous duty
       station and reason member should not be allowed to proceed to new duty station. Include all per-
       tinent details.
       4.17.1.5. Current location of member to include address, contact phone number.

         4.17.1.6. Location of dependents, status of HHG/POV, etc.
         4.17.1.7. Remarks. (Include any additional information having a bearing on the case (such as, if
         action is pending, state the kind of action and the approximate date a decision will be made).
         4.17.1.8. Grade, name, duty title, organization, DSN, datafax phone number and e-mail address of
         official initiating the request. When a request is submitted by a POC on behalf of the initiating
         official, include the above information for both persons.
      4.17.2. Upon receipt of a request, HQ AFPC/DPAPP will take action as appropriate. Before an
      approval or disapproval decision can be made, sometimes additional coordination may be necessary, a
      request for approval of funding may be required, or forwarding of the request for consideration by a
      higher authority may be necessary. When a request is approved, the approval message will contain the
      specific instructions for amendment of PCS orders, funding instructions and designate what AF instal-
      lation is responsible for the member while TDY. Whenever practical, members placed on TDY will
      be attached for administration to the nearest AF installation.

                                                         course or courses including travel time
                                                         between courses (see notes 6 and 7).

NOTES:
  1. If upon being advised of the requirement for training in conjunction with a PCS, a member alleges
     attendance will create a personal hardship, the MPF will immediately advise the gaining MAJ-
     COM of the specifics of the hardship with an information copy to the assignment OPR. The gain-
     ing MAJCOM will evaluate the circumstances and direct action with information copy to the
     assignment OPR, or request action by the assignment OPR, as appropriate.
      2. For courses of 20 weeks or more, members will attend in PCS status. EXCEPTION: Airmen
         graduating from basic training who are assigned directly to technical school are assigned in PCS
         status, regardless of the course length.
      3. Additional restrictions to travel mode are:
         a. Do not direct travel TDY and return to the new base after PCS if assigning member OS.
         b. Do not direct travel TDY and return to the current OS base before PCS for those returning
            from OS to a CONUS assignment.
         c. Do not direct TDY en route PCS when member has a COT within the same theater and train-
            ing in the CONUS.
         d. Direct TDY en route PCS when a member has a COT to a different OS theater and training in
            the CONUS.
         e. Do not direct TDY en route PCS for members whose TDY location is within commuting dis-
            tance of either their losing or gaining base.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                239


  4. When more than one TDY option exists the assignment OPR or MPF computes the options and
     directs the least costly option. There are times when the directed travel mode may cause a mem-
     ber a personal, financial or dependent hardship. If the member requests deviation from the least
     expensive mode based on hardship, he or she will submit a request substantiating the details of
     hardship to the MPF Commander for final approval/disapproval. Do not approve deviations
     solely for personal convenience.
  5. For members performing TDY en route, the PCS also begins upon departure from their current
     station, therefore, members must meet all PCS eligibility requirements, (for example, TOS, sec-
     ond PCS in same FY, etc.) as of their departure date unless the appropriate authority approves the
     required waiver (see paragraph 2.26.). Determine if minimum TOS is met per paragraph 2.25.
     and the Fiscal Year for DLA entitlement (see paragraph 2.52.) based on the date the member
     departs on PCS.
  6. When assigning members OS who attend a course or courses in TDY en route status do not
     include in special orders that the member must depart the training location the day after gradua-
     tion from the last course. The number of days leave a member desires (if any) between course
     graduation and their port reporting date is managed by controlling the departure date from the last
     training location. Travel arrangements and the members arrival at the port must be in compliance
     with their port reporting instructions. Members who arrive at the port earlier than their directed
     reporting instructions will be charged with leave and could incur additional expenses while wait-
     ing for their scheduled transportation.
  7. Include in the special orders a "report not earlier than date" one day prior to class start date and
     direct the member to depart not later than one day after graduation. Do not include the "report not
     earlier than date" for the second or subsequent course, but do include a report not later than date.
     Member must report for duty immediately upon completion of travel. Charge leave to those who
     complete travel, but do not report for duty, up to the day they report for duty (class).
  8. Officers selected to attend missile training with subsequent assignment to a missile unit will pro-
     ceed directly from AETC training to operation readiness training, then to unit of assignment using
     authorized travel time only. The member must take leave en route, if desired, before entry into
     AETC training.
  9. If satisfactory completion of training is a prerequisite for the next assignment, then member is not
     permitted to make the PCS to the new duty station first and then attend training via TDY and
     return to the new base.

NOTES:
  1. Use the more restrictive rule if member meets two conditions.
      2. When the TDY return date is after the person's DOS or PDD (for PCS) and when necessary to fill
         short notice taskings, commanders can still select the person for the TDY providing the TDY
         orders or amendments reflect the shortened TDY duration and the person returns according to the
         times in this table.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                           241


  3. You may assign members to mobility positions upon arrival on station and they may remain
     against a mobility position until their departure.

  4. Commanders may waive DOS/PCS (Cols D and E) selection minimums. However, review all
     other options before committing assigned members on TDY who are separating/retiring or mak-
     ing a PCS. When waiving minimums, the TDY completion date must not interfere with process-
     ing or departure date for PCS or DOS. Severe problems can occur if a person's DOS expires while
     TDY.
  5. Commanders needing to waive the six-month TOS exemption for operational requirements must
     obtain approval from their MAJCOM/CV.
  6. Deployment Availability Code (DAV) 57 must be update IAW AFI 10-403 by PRU.

accompanies selection for PCS.
248                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


Assignment Selection Date (ASD)—The date an officer or airman is selected by name for assignment by
the assignment OPR; or the date the assignment process begins in order to reassign an officer or airman on
a scheduled future date (such as upon DEROS, tour completion date from a CONUS maximum stabilized
tour, the date a member will become surplus, and so on); or the date an officer (only) is identified by the
assignment OPR as vulnerable for PCS selection. See Table 2.8.
Attached—Responsibility for a member for temporary administration or duty at other than his or her
permanent unit of assignment (and the unit of attachment is other than member's permanent duty station),
for temporary command and control during the member's absence similar to that exercised at the
member's permanent duty station.
Authorization—A funded and validated manpower requirement.
Availability Date—The day, month, and year after which a member is available for assignment. For
assignment purposes, usually only the month and year are used to determine availability.
Basic Military Training (BMT)—Training provided to non-prior service airmen to effect an orderly
transition from civilian to military life.
Cancellation of Permanent Change of Station (PCS)—R e v o k i n g o r r e s c i n d i n g a s s i g n m e n t
instructions.
Career Airman—An airman other than first-term.
Career Bachelor OS Tour–-—A career bachelor is defined as an enlisted member with 4 or more years
active duty or an officer, captain or above, with more than 4 years of commissioned active duty who is
single or divorced, and has no legal dependents residing in household on the date departed CONUS, and
the OS tour length to which being assigned is 36 months accompanied and 24 months unaccompanied.
Upon SAF direction, career bachelors may be required to serve the 36 month tour length.
Career Job Reservation (CJR)—An airman's reenlistment quota.
Career Officer—For assignment purposes, officers serving in the grades of captain and above and who
have 4 or more years of commissioned active service on or before the official notification date, or
nomination for assignment, education or training. All other officers are noncareer officers.
Command-Sponsored Dependent—See Dependent, Command-Sponsored.
Commander—Unless otherwise specified, refers to the immediate commander of the member concerned
and includes officially appointed squadron section commanders.
Concurrent Travel—Authorized move of dependents at government expense to an OS area at the same
time as sponsor.
Consecutive OS Tour (COT)—For assignment purposes, a new OS tour that starts after completing a
previous OS tour without an intervening assignment within the continental United States.
Continental United States (CONUS)—The 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia and, for
assignment purposes, the adjacent territorial waters.
Continuation of Assignment—A change of a member's end assignment that takes place after a member's
departure from previous duty station, but before arrival at the original new duty station and before the
RNLTD. (For continuation of OS tour, see paragraph 2.48.)
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    249


CONUS—Isolated StationThose locations where adequate community support facilities and services do
not exist within 50 miles or are over 1 1/2 hours drive, one way, in normal weather conditions.
Community support includes government or non-government facilities and services, such as: adequate
family housing, medical and dental care, essential shopping facilities, reasonable recreation facilities, and
religious services. During such assignments, the member and their families may experience a
significantly greater degree of inconvenience, expense, and hardship when compared to assignment to
other CONUS locations. Also, due to hazardous weather, marginal roads or lack of commercial
transportation, the person is at greater risk when traveling between the duty station, residence, and support
facilities.
Curtailment—Termination of an OS tour before completion of the prescribed length, including any
extensions (except cancellation of a voluntary extension). Terminal leave taken before DEROS is not a
tour curtailment and is not a DEROS change. Ordinary leave begins and ends in the local area; therefore,
it is not a DEROS change or curtailment.
Deferment—A personnel management tool, used to preclude or delay assignment selection of an
individual or group when in the best interest of the Air Force. See Table 2.1. for AACs for the deferment
reasons and periods. When a person has an AAC they are ineligible for reassignment until their date of

                                                 Attachment 2

                                      BASE OF PREFERENCE (BOP)
                                           (AIRMEN ONLY)

A2.1. Purpose. The first-term airman (FTA) BOP program is a reenlistment incentive under the
CAREERS programs (see AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force). The career airman
BOP program is an incentive for other airmen to continue an Air Force career.

A2.2. FTA Program.
      A2.2.1. General Information. In conjunction with reenlistment, FTA may request a PCS BOP or a
      BOP to remain in-place. FTA may also request a BOP in conjunction with reenlistment and retraining
      (see AFI 36-2626, Airman Retraining Program). Airmen may request PCS CONUS to CONUS, or
      PCS from OS to CONUS. Airmen in the CONUS (only) may request a BOP to remain in-place. An
      airman in the CONUS may apply for a PCS BOP and an in-place BOP at the same time. A FTA PCS
      BOP is not authorized from CONUS to OS, or OS to OS, since these assignments are made in accor-
      dance with OS PCS selection priorities. An in-place FTA BOP is not authorized for airmen assigned
      OS since these airmen have other options to remain at their current OS location consistent with their
      eligibility.
      A2.2.2. Eligibility Criteria and Restrictions. The following general eligibility criteria and restrictions
      apply to all FTA BOPs. Additional eligibility criteria and restrictions may apply to a specific BOP
      option as shown below. Airmen who are ineligible or who desire BOP consideration other than as
      authorized may submit a request as an exception to policy as outlined in paragraph 1.5.
         A2.2.2.1. Must have a category of enlistment of “1”; first term airman and never applied for a
         FTA BOP.
         A2.2.2.2. Must be selected under the Selective Reenlistment Program (SRP) and have an
         approved CJR.
         A2.2.2.3. Must not have been selected for PCS or have an ASD (see paragraph 2.30. for ASD
         based on a schedule.)
         A2.2.2.4. Must not be in AAC 05, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25, 27 as listed in Table 2.1.
         A2.2.2.5. Must submit their application prior to reenlistment.
         A2.2.2.6. Consecutive BOPs in any combination are not authorized. For example, a FTA who
         receives an in-place BOP cannot then receive a career airman PCS BOP. They must have an inter-
         vening PCS.
         A2.2.2.7. BOP combinations other than those listed are not authorized. For example, airman may
         not request a consecutive OS tour (COT) as a BOP.
         A2.2.2.8. Military Couples. The join spouse intent code is a major factor when considering the
         BOP request from a member of a military couple. Both members of a military couple may request
         BOP consideration in their own right, if both are eligible. If the intent code is “A” or “B” then the
         member must request the same locations in the same order (including in-place), or both requests
         will be disapproved. If one member is ineligible, regardless of the reason, both requests will be
         disapproved. (Exception: For FTA requesting a BOP in conjunction with retraining or FTA mar-
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                259


     ried to another FTA, both members of the military couple do not have to be eligible for BOP, how-
     ever, manning must support join spouse to BOP location.) When one member of a military couple
     requests a BOP and the intent code is “H” the request will be considered. Refer to Attachment 8,
     paragraph A8.3.10. and A8.5.2. for information on how this action may affect future join spouse
     assignment consideration.
     A2.2.2.9. Withdrawal of an approved BOP (PCS or in-place) due to declining retainability consti-
     tutes use of the BOP option, and no further BOP consideration will be given. A voluntary request
     by an airman to terminate the 2-year BOP deferment must be submitted through the servicing
     MPF to the assignment OPR for consideration. NOTE: Voluntary withdrawal of a BOP applica-
     tion (PCS or in-place) prior to final decision by HQ AFPC does not constitute usage of BOP.

            tour length is 18 months or more, or 10 months prior to DEROS where the unaccompanied
            tour length is less than 18 months. The RIP must be returned to the MPF within 30 days of
            the day it was produced. Members who desire BOP consideration must make an election
            on their RIP to retain current DEROS and must obtain the required PCS retainability for
            CONUS PCS consideration as shown in Table 2.5. Airmen apply using Figure A2.1. or
            via AMS web. In the event approval of a CONUS BOP is not possible, a CONUS PCS will
            be provided as a normal returnee.
            A2.2.3.3.3.2. Commander. Applications do not have to be reviewed by the commander.

     PCS or in-place consideration, or both.
        A2.2.4.1.1. Application Procedures.
            A2.2.4.1.1.1. Airman. Airmen request BOP consideration at the same time they apply for
            a CJR and retraining as outlined in AFI 36-2606 and AFI 36-2626. BOP consideration is in
            the AFSC into which being retrained. When a BOP is not desired, enter the following
            statement in the BOP selection of the retraining application: “I have been told about the
            BOP program for first-term airmen and do not desire to apply. I understand I will not be
            given another opportunity to apply for a first-term airman BOP.”
            A2.2.4.1.1.2. BOP preferences are listed in the BOP section of the retraining application.
            Airmen may list up to 8 CONUS bases in order of preference. Preferences will be consid-
            ered in the exact order listed. For example, if a request lists two PCS preferences and then
            an in-place preference, followed by additional PCS preferences, they will be considered in
            that order. NOTE: Use CONUS bases only when indicating a preference. Do not use
            regions or states as preferences.
            A2.2.4.1.1.3. The action on a member’s request will vary depending on preferences stated
            and whether retraining is accomplished by TDY or PCS. For example, if the retraining is
            to a PCS course, then the BOP consideration would be for the first assignment after train-
            ing is completed. If a BOP request cannot be approved, then assignment will be based on
            the needs of the Air Force.
            A2.2.4.1.1.4. Commander. Must recommend member for retraining before BOP prefer-
            ences will receive consideration.
            A2.2.4.1.1.5. MPF.
               A2.2.4.1.1.5.1. When retraining requests is approved, airmen are required to get
               retainability (reenlist) to accept the retraining action as outlined in AFI 36-2626, Table
               3.3. This amount of retainability is normally less than that required for a CONUS to
               CONUS PCS (that is 24 months). Therefore, in order to satisfy the PCS retainability
               requirement, airmen must satisfactorily complete the retraining course and then reen-
               list in the new AFSC before they are permitted to depart from the training location,
               regardless whether training is attended in PCS or TDY en route status. If an airman
               attending training in PCS status refuses to reenlist, then reclama the retraining PCS
               assignment per paragraph 2.47. When an airman is attending in TDY en route status, a
               delay in obtaining retainability for PCS until award of the 3-skill level is authorized as

                outlined in Table 2.7., rule 3 and note 6. If the airman refuses to reenlist, then do not
                permit the airman to depart the training location and comply with the instructions in
                Table 2.7., note 6.
                A2.2.4.1.1.5.2. When an in-place BOP is approved, MilPDS will automatically update
                AAC 28 with an expiration date 24 months from date of approval.
                A2.2.4.1.1.5.3. For PCS BOP, the gaining MPF updates AAC 28 upon in-processing
                with expiration date of 24 months from DAS.
                A2.2.4.1.1.5.4. If the retraining request is disapproved then the BOP request is not
                considered. Airmen may request any of the BOP options for which they remain eligi-
                ble.
                A2.2.4.1.1.5.5. AFPC. Approves or disapproves in-place BOP requests via MilPDS.
      A2.2.4.2. OS to CONUS (With Retraining).

         depending on retraining class start date.
         A2.2.4.2.2. Must not have been selected for PCS
         A2.2.4.2.3. Application Procedures.
            A2.2.4.2.3.1. Airman. Airman requests BOP consideration at the same time they apply for
            a CJR and retraining as outlined in AFI 36-2606 and AFI 36-2626. BOP consideration is in
            the AFSC into which being retrained.. When a BOP is not desired, enter the following
            statement in the BOP section of the retraining application: “I have been told about the BOP
            program for first-term airmen and do not desire to apply. I understand I will not be given
            another opportunity to apply for a first-term airman BOP.”
            A2.2.4.2.3.2. BOP preferences are listed in the BOP section of the retraining application.
            Airmen may list up to 8 CONUS bases in order of preference. Prefer3ences will be consid-
            ered in the exact order listed. For example, if a request lists two PCS preferences and then
            an in-place preference, followed by additional PCS preferences, they will be considered in
            that order. NOTE: Use CONUS bases only when indicating a preference. Do not use
            regions or states as preferences.
            A2.2.4.2.3.3. The action on a member’s request will vary depending on preferences stated
            and whether retraining is accomplished by TDY or PCS. For example, if the training is to
            a PCS course then the BOP consideration would be for the first assignment after training is
            completed. If a BOP request cannot be approved, then assignment will be based on the
            needs of the Air Force.
            A2.2.4.2.3.4. Requests must be submitted before reenlistment. Requests submitted before
            reenlistment are processed even if the airman reenlists before the BOP determination is
            made.
            A2.2.4.2.3.5. Commander. Must recommend member for retraining before BOP prefer-
            ences will receive consideration.

AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    263


                  A2.2.4.2.3.6.1. When retaining request is approved, airmen are required to get retain-
                  ability to accept the retraining action as outlined in AFI 36-2626, Table 3.3. Normally
                  this satisfies the requirement for OS to CONUS PCS retainability when course atten-
                  dance is TDY en route. If an airman is to attend a PCS training course they must reen-
                  list upon completion of the course and prior to departure on PCS. If the airmen refuses
                  to reenlist, then reclama the retraining PCS assignment per paragraph 2.47.
                  A2.2.4.2.3.6.2. The servicing MPF at the BOP location updates AAC 28 and the expi-
                  ration date is 24 months from the date arrived station.
                  A2.2.4.2.3.6.3. If the retraining request is approved then the BOP request is not con-
                  sidered. Upon receipt of disapproved retraining, airmen may request BOP PCS consid-
                  eration in current AFSC as an exception.

A2.3. Career Airman Program.
   A2.3.1. General Information. Career airmen may request a PCS BOP CONUS to CONUS (only) or
   may request a BOP to remain in-place at a CONUS location. Other BOP combinations are not autho-
   rized since other assignments are made in accordance with OS PCS selection priorities and OS to
   CONUS PCS selection priorities. For airmen currently assigned OS, other programs exist to request to
   remain at an OS location.
   A2.3.2. Eligibility Criteria and Restrictions. The following general eligibility criteria and restrictions
   apply.
      A2.3.2.1. Must have at least 41 months TOS (3 years, 5 months) at the time of application and at
      least 4 years TOS before PCS departure. EXCEPTION: If currently serving on a minimum stabi-
      lized tour of at least 4 years, can apply no earlier than 7 months before completing the stabilized
      tour. If serving on a maximum stabilized tour of at least 4 years, can apply no earlier than 12
      months and no later than 9 months before completing the stabilized tour.
      A2.3.2.2. Must have a category of enlistment code of “2 – Second term airmen” or “4 – Career
      airman” and be selected under the SRP.
      A2.3.2.3. Must not have been selected for PCS or have an ASD (see paragraph 2.30. for ASD
      based upon a schedule).
      A2.3.2.4. Must not be in AAC 05, 08, 09, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25, or 27 as listed in
      Table 2.1.
      A2.3.2.5. Consecutive BOPs in any combination are not authorized.
      A2.3.2.6. Must have or be eligible to obtain the required retainability
      A2.3.2.7. Must not be an OS volunteer or have any other voluntary applications pending.
      A2.3.2.8. Airmen vulnerable for OS PCS selection may apply, however, OS vulnerability will be
      a factor in approval or disapproval.
      A2.3.2.9. Manning will be a factor in approval or disapproval.
      A2.3.2.10. Airmen may ask for a BOP in an awarded AFSC other than CAFSC; however,
      approval is based on the needs of the Air Force. A request for this consideration must specifically
      be stated in the remarks of the in-system MilPDS request.
264                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


         A2.3.2.11. Military Couples. The join spouse intent code is a major factor when considering the
         BOP request from a member of a military couple. Both members of a military couple may request
         BOP consideration in their own right, if both are eligible. If the intent code is “A” or “B” then the
         member must request the same locations in the same order (including in-place), or both requests
         will be disapproved. If one member is ineligible, regardless of the reason, both requests will be
         disapproved. (EXCEPTION: For FTA requesting a BOP in conjunction with retraining or FTA
         married to another FTA, both members of the military couple do not have to be eligible for BOP,
         however, manning must support join spouse to BOP location.) When one member of a military
         couple requests a BOP and the intent code is “H” the request will be considered. Refer to Attach-
         ment 8, paragraph A8.3.10. and A8.5.2. for information on how this action may affect future join
         spouse assignment consideration.
         A2.3.2.12. Withdrawal of an approved BOP (PCS or in-place) due to declining retainability con-
         stitutes use of the BOP option, and no further BOP consideration will be given. A voluntary
         request by an airman to terminate the 2-year BOP deferment must be submitted through the servic-
         ing MPF to the assignment OPR for consideration. NOTE: Voluntary withdrawal of a BOP appli-
         cation (PCS or in-place) prior to final decision by HQ AFPC does not constitute usage of BOP.
      A2.3.3. CONUS to CONUS PCS and/or In-Place (CONUS only).
         A2.3.3.1. Application Procedures.
            A2.3.3.1.1. Airman. Airman may apply for PCS (only) using Figure A2.1. or via AMS Web.
            If applying for an in-place BOP (only), or both PCS and in-place BOP, they must use the
            (hard-copy) application shown in Figure A2.1.
            A2.3.3.1.2. Airman may list up to 8 CONUS bases in order of preference. Preferences will be
            considered in the exact order listed. For example, if a request lists two PCS preferences and
            then an in-place preference, followed by additional PCS preferences, they will be considered
            in that order. NOTE: Use CONUS bases only when indicating a preference. Do not use
            regions or states as preferences.
            A2.3.3.1.3. When a member’s request is disapproved, airmen may resubmit after 6 months
            from the date of disapproval when requesting the same locations. The member need not wait
            six months when requesting different locations. There is no limit on the number of times an
            airman may apply.
            A2.3.3.1.4. Commander. Applications for PCS (only) do not have to be reviewed by the com-
            mander. If in-place consideration is being requested (or if both PCS and in-place is requested),
            then submit a (hard copy) application using Figure A2.1.
            A2.3.3.1.5. MPF. The MPF reviews eligibility of the applicant and updates hard copy applica-
            tions via MilPDS. For applications updated via AMS Web, a BOP transaction request will
            automatically be produced.
            A2.3.3.1.6. If airman’s request is approved, ensure the airman obtains 24 months service
            retainability within 30 days of approval notification. Airmen may request a delay in obtaining
            retainability as outlined in paragraph 2.29.6.8. and Table 2.7.
            A2.3.3.1.7. When an in-place BOP is approved the AAC 28 is automatically updated with an
            expiration date 24 months from date of approval. For PCS BOP, the gaining MPF updates
            AAC 28 upon in-processing with an expiration date 24 months from DAS.

SUBJECT: BOP Application - AFSC
1. Please consider me for a BOP assignment to one of the bases listed below or please consider me
for an in-place BOP. The bases listed below were not my last assignment. If it was my last
assignment, I was not assigned there under any BOP provision. Note: Use CONUS bases only when
indicating a preference. Do not use regions or states as preferences.
2. (For airmen married to other military members only.) I have been counseled on BOP and
join-spouse assignment criteria. I understand if I request a BOP, I will first be considered for
assignment to my spouse’s location unless join spouse assignment is not desired (intent code H). If I
receive an approved PCS BOP, then join spouse assignment to the BOP location for my spouse is not
authorized. If I proceed on a PCS BOP I understand I am responsible for the family separation
created. I understand we may each request a BOP in our own right to the same location (including
in-place), if we are both eligible. I understand approval of a PCS or in-place BOP does not result in
deferment for my spouse. For FTA retraining under QRP: I understand I will have my BOP
application considered in preference order and my spouse will be considered for a join spouse
assignment unless join spouse assignment is not desired (intent code H). However, I understand that
manning at the requested locations must support both myself and my spouse in order for the
assignments to be approved.
3. I understand I will be required to have or obtain the necessary 24 months retainability (computed
from the RNLTD (Year and month) within 30 days of approval and if I am a FTA I must reenlist to
suffice this retainability requirement. I also understand that voluntary cancellation of an approved
BOP on my behalf or refusal to obtain the necessary retainability constitutes use of my BOP option.

                         CONUS-ISOLATED ASSIGNMENT PROGRAM

A3.1. Purpose . To establish minimum tour lengths and limit certain assignment combinations which
involve CONUS-isolated stations (see Attachment 1, Definitions). There are currently four locations
designated as CONUS-isolated. They are Stallion Missile Range, NM (near Socorro, NM); Cavalier, ND;
Utah Test and Training Range, UT; and Boulder, WY. These locations are considered to be geographi-
cally separated from adequate personal support facilities and services which may cause a significant
degree of inconvenience, expense, or hardship to members and their families more so than other CONUS
assignments.

A3.2. CONUS-Isolated Designation/Tour Lengths.
   A3.2.1. Stations may be designated as CONUS-isolated when:
       A3.2.1.1. The one-way distance to minimum adequate community support is more than 50 miles
       or over 1 and 1/2 hours drive in normal weather conditions from the station. Community support
       includes government or non-government facilities and services, such as adequate family housing,
       medical and dental care, essential shopping facilities, reasonable recreational facilities, and reli-
       gious services.
       A3.2.1.2. Travel between duty station, residence, and support facilities is determined to be com-
       plicated by hazardous weather, marginal roads, or lack of commercial transportation which places
       the member in a greater risk.
   A3.2.2. Minimum tour lengths for CONUS-isolated stations have been established as:
       A3.2.2.1. Fifteen months for single and unaccompanied members. (NOTE: If an airman is
       assigned to a CONUS-isolated station on a BOP assignment, he or she must serve a 24 month
       BOP), or
       A3.2.2.2. Twenty four months for members accompanied by dependents. Members will serve the
       accompanied tour if they reside with dependents within 50 miles of the duty station. Distances are
       computed from the standard highway mileage guide available at the FSO.
   A3.2.3. The PCS retainability requirements shown in Table 2.5. apply regardless whether the mem-
   ber will serve a 15 month unaccompanied tour or 24 month accompanied tour. For example, a mem-
   ber being reassigned CONUS to CONUS requires 24 months retainability for the PCS, even though
   they may choose to serve the 15 month unaccompanied tour. Further, in order to be reassigned upon
   completion of a 15 or 24 month tour, members must have PCS retainability prescribed by Table 2.5.
   for their next assignment. Members who do not have the minimum retainability for PCS remain
   assigned.

A3.3. Member Actions.
   A3.3.1. To apply for reassignment to a CONUS-isolated station:
       A3.3.1.1. Officers use Figure A3.1. or AFAS guidelines, and airmen use Figure A3.1.
   A3.3.2. Members already assigned at CONUS-isolated stations receive a RIP about 11 months from
   their DOA established according to Table 2.1. (AAC 53). This is their notification that they may
268                                                 AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      apply for reassignment. A request for reassignment will not be accepted if submitted more than 11
      months before an officer or airman’s DOA. To apply for reassignment from a CONUS-isolated sta-
      tion:
         A3.3.2.1. Officers use Figure A3.2. or AFAS guidelines, and airmen use Figure A3.2.
         A3.3.2.2. Members who delay submitting a request for reassignment from a CONUS-isolated sta-
         tion reduce the probability of a reassignment date that coincides with their DOA. Members may
         be held beyond the desired movement date to permit adequate time for identification and notifica-
         tion of a replacement. AF requirements determine when actual reassignment will occur.

A3.4. Commander Actions.
      A3.4.1. Verifies members assignment eligibility.
      A3.4.2. Sends requests to designate a location as a CONUS-isolated station to the parent MAJCOM/
      DPA. The MAJCOM, in turn, submits the request with appropriate recommendation to HQ AFPC/
      DPAPP1 for final determination.

A3.5. MPF Actions.
      A3.5.1. Upon receipt of request for PCS to or from a CONUS-isolated station, verifies a member’s
      assignment eligibility (ensure member does not have an ASD), updates the PDS using PTI 550 as out-
      lined in AFCSM 36-699, and suspenses a copy of the application pending final response from the HQ
      AFPC assignment OPR.
      A3.5.2. Updates AAC 53 as shown in Table 2.1. upon arrival of a member at a CONUS-isolated sta-
      tion.
      A3.5.3. Counsels members at CONUS-isolated stations who request release from selection for an
      involuntary OS short tour, or who receive a change in assignment, that they remain vulnerable for
      future OS short tour selection.

A3.6. MAJCOM Actions.
      A3.6.1. Submit requests to establish or delete CONUS-isolated stations to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 using
      the criteria outlined in paragraph
      A3.6.2. Submit desired input to HQ AFPC assignment OPR for consideration during the evaluation
      process upon receipt of a member’s request to move from a CONUS-isolated station.
      A3.6.3. May disapprove a member’s request to move from a CONUS-isolated station when manning
      conditions warrant.

A3.7. Assignment OPR Actions.
      A3.7.1. Does not involuntarily assign members to consecutive CONUS-isolated stations. Members
      may be selected for a CONUS PCS or an OS assignment (short or long tour based on their OS vulner-
      ability) when they complete their CONUS-isolated tours.
      A3.7.2. Does not involuntarily assign people to CONUS-isolated stations immediately upon comple-
      tion of an unaccompanied OS short tour unless there is no other reasonable alternative.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                           269


  A3.7.3. Does not divert an airman who received one of their choices in the OS returnee match to a
  CONUS-isolated station.
  A3.7.4. Determines if an assignment change request from a member who has been selected for an
  involuntary unaccompanied OS short tour from a CONUS-isolated station can be supported. If possi-
  ble, change the assignment to a CONUS or any OS long tour assignment.
     A3.7.4.1. Approval of a change of assignment request must depend on availability of other
     resources to fill the short tour requirement.
  A3.7.5. Reconsideration of a request to depart a CONUS-isolated tour for the same assignment pref-
  erences will not be considered until 6 months have passed from the initial disapproval.
  A3.7.6. Establishes RNLTDs based on manning requirements. Sends approvals to the MPF by PTI
  517 and disapprovals by PTI 52T.
  A3.7.7. Considers volunteers for OS assignments as a mandatory PCS to the extent possible upon
  completion of a CONUS-isolated tour as outlined in tables 6A and 6B.
  A3.7.8. Considers ODSD and STRD waivers.

  CONSECUTIVE OS TOUR (COT), IN-PLACE CONSECUTIVE OS TOUR (IPCOT), AND
              INVOLUNTARY CONSECUTIVE OS TOURS (ICOT)

A4.1. COT General Information.
   A4.1.1. The objective of the voluntary COT program is twofold: conserve PCS funds by encouraging
   eligible members to serve consecutive OS tours and reduce PCS turbulence. Since OS returnees must
   move, a move from the CONUS to the OS location is eliminated when an OS returnee fills another OS
   requirement. COTs are authorized for any combination of OS assignments (short to long, long to long,
   etc.).
   A4.1.2. All PCS assignments between OS duty stations must be accomplished as COTs except when
   a member is reassigned on a continuation of tour due to being surplus (paragraph 2.48.). Do not use
   the abbreviation COT in reference to a continuation of tour.
   A4.1.3. Members reassigned on a COT must serve the full prescribed tour at their current location
   and must serve the full prescribed tour at the gaining location. Exceptions involving curtailment of
   current OS tour and reassignment on a COT may be requested according to paragraph 1.5. and will be
   considered on a case by case basis.
   A4.1.4. The member’s ODSD and STRD (if applicable) will be updated after completion of the orig-
   inal tour, plus any approved DEROS extension.
   A4.1.5. For COT, no priority travel of dependents or guarantee of government quarters is given over
   members being assigned from the CONUS.

A4.2. COT Consideration.
   A4.2.1. To receive consideration for a COT, members must be eligible for PCS to include having at
   least 12 months PCS retainability from current DEROS, and meet COT eligibility requirements, for
   example, Table 2.6.
   A4.2.2. Officers. Officers volunteer for a COT using the preference worksheet.
   A4.2.3. Airmen. Airmen volunteer for a COT by updating OS preferences in the PDS. To ensure
   these are viable COT preferences, the OS EQUAL should be used.

A4.3. COT Selection Priorities/Procedures and Retainability Requirements.
   A4.3.1. COT volunteers receive assignment consideration according to the priorities in Table 3.3.
   and Table 3.4. Intratheater COTs are more economical than intertheater and receive consideration
   ahead of intertheater COTs regardless of the order or preference.
   A4.3.2. Airmen. Volunteers for COT receive consideration for requirements (reporting) during their
   DEROS month plus the following two months (for example, a COT volunteer with a June DEROS
   will receive consideration for requirements with reporting during June, July, or August). Airmen with
   an indefinite DEROS receive continuous consideration for COT provided their DEROS remains
   indefinite, they maintain OS preferences in the PDS, they remain eligible for PCS, and they are not
   within eight months of their DOS. Once an airman is within eight months of DOS, the DEROS is
   automatically established to equal the DOS and COT consideration stops.
274                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


         A4.3.2.1. Airmen with an indefinite DEROS selected for a COT will not depart before complet-
         ing the full current tour, plus any previously approved DEROS extensions.
         A4.3.2.2. Airmen are considered for COT in their CAFSC. Airmen may request consideration in
         an additionally awarded AFSC by message to the assignment OPR with information copy to the
         MAJCOM. Such a request must be submitted prior to ASD and the needs of the AF determine if
         selection is approved in an additional AFSC. Airmen possessing an OS imbalance AFSC will nor-
         mally be considered only in that AFSC. However, if a COT cannot be approved in the imbalance
         AFSC, airmen may be considered in an additional AFSC. The assignment OPR has final approval/
         disapproval authority.
         A4.3.2.3. Airmen notified of COT approval have 30 calendar days from notification in which to
         take one of the following actions as outlined in paragraph 2.29.: obtain the full required retainabil-
         ity for the OS unaccompanied tour; decline in writing (AF Form 964) to obtain the additional COT
         retainability or; request a delay in obtaining the retainability from the MPF Commander. Delays
         can only be considered for the reasons provided in Table 2.7.

A4.4. Release From/Cancellation of an Approved COT.
      A4.4.1. The requirement to request concurrent travel (CCTVL) still exists when a COT assignment is
      to an OS location where CCTVL is not automatic. If for some reason CCTVL cannot be approved for
      a COT from one accompanied long tour to another, the MPF reclamas the assignment upon receiving
      the denial of CCTVL.
      A4.4.2. Officers. See paragraph 2.12.
      A4.4.3. Airmen. Airmen may submit a request for release from a COT based on a change of volunteer
      status (this does not delay the requirement for airmen to obtain COT retainability). See paragraph
      2.12. This type request will usually be approved if sufficient lead time exists to select a replacement
      (150 or more days from RNLTD). In these requests the MPF uses PDS to reclama the COT assign-
      ment. A reclama request made within 150 days of the RNLTD must be sent by message to the assign-
      ment OPR, with information copies to the losing and gaining MAJCOMs, and must include full
      justification for the request. Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

A4.5. COT Entitlements (see the JFTR, chapter 7, and AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program).
      A4.5.1. Members who will serve a COT, and in certain circumstances their command sponsored
      dependents, may be entitled to COT travel and transportation allowances as provided in the JFTR,
      paragraph U7200. In no instance can these entitlements be used prior to completion of the member’s
      current tour.
      A4.5.2. Leave taken in conjunction with COT travel and transportation entitlements is chargeable
      leave.

A4.6. IPCOT General Information.
      A4.6.1. The objective of the IPCOT program is the same as for COT (see paragraph A4.1.1. above).
      A4.6.2. The IPCOT tour length must be equal to or greater than the tour length currently being
      served. For example, a member serving a 36 month accompanied tour may not serve a 24 month
      (unaccompanied) IPCOT. EXCEPTIONS: A member serving an accompanied tour who has a change
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                               275


   in dependent status and is no longer accompanied by dependents may request an unaccompanied
   IPCOT. In addition, airmen may request a standard tour length IPCOT if currently serving the
   extended long tour and single officers with no dependents may request a standard unaccompanied tour
   length IPCOT if serving the accompanied equivalent tour length.
   A4.6.3. Members serving the unaccompanied tour at a location where an accompanied tour is autho-
   rized may serve an accompanied IPCOT, if desired, provided they have, or are able to obtain, retain-
   ability to serve the full accompanied tour (plus, for airmen, 12 additional months if selected as an
   extended long tour volunteer). Member’s must understand that this change of tour is effective on com-
   pletion of the current unaccompanied tour, and any previously approved DEROS extension. The use
   of entitlements associated with the accompanied IPCOT (transportation of dependents, shipment of
   HHGs, etc.) is not authorized until completion of the full unaccompanied tour, plus any extensions.
   A4.6.4. For members with an established DEROS, the IPCOT is effective on completion of the cur-
   rent tour, and any previously approved DEROS extension. The IPCOT DEROS is computed by add-
   ing the full length of the tour the member elects to the current DEROS. For members with an
   indefinite DEROS, the IPCOT DEROS is effective upon completion of either the initial full pre-
   scribed tour, plus any previously approved DEROS extensions, or upon approval by the HQ AFPC
   assignment OPR if the original tour, plus extensions, has been completed.
   A4.6.5. The member’s ODSD and STRD (if applicable) will be updated after completion of the orig-
   inal tour, plus any approved DEROS extension. DAS will not change.
   A4.6.6. For IPCOT, no priority travel of dependents or guarantee of government quarters is given
   over members being assigned from the CONUS.
   A4.6.7. IPCOT approval is based on manning by location, not unit, so the possibility exists that the
   member may be reassigned to another unit or command at the same OS location.

A4.7. IPCOT Consideration.
   A4.7.1. To receive consideration for an IPCOT, members must be eligible for PCS to include having
   at least 12 months PCS retainability from current DEROS, and meet IPCOT eligibility requirements,
   for example, Table 2.6.
   A4.7.2. Officers. Officers volunteer for an IPCOT using the assignment worksheet.
   A4.7.3. Airmen. Airmen with an established DEROS, or those assigned to long tour locations in
   Alaska and Hawaii, request an IPCOT at the time of DEROS forecasting by using the DEROSO RIP.
   Airmen with an indefinite DEROS may request an IPCOT at any time through use of PC III at either
   the CSS or MPF.
   A4.7.4. The unit commander must certify member’s eligibility, including quality control, and recom-
   mend approval or disapproval. Recommending disapproval requires specific reasons, and the request
   is then provided to the MSS/CC for consideration. If the MSS/CC concurs with the disapproval rec-
   ommendation, the request is returned to the member with no further action taken.

A4.8. IPCOT Selection Priorities/Procedures and Retainability Requirements.
   A4.8.1. An IPCOT preference is considered ahead of all COT preferences.
276                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      A4.8.2. Airmen are considered for IPCOT in their CAFSC. Airmen may request consideration in an
      additionally awarded AFSC by message to the assignment OPR with information copy to the MAJ-
      COM. The needs of the AF determine if selection is approved in an additional AFSC. Airmen possess-
      ing an OS imbalance AFSC will normally be considered only in that AFSC. However, if an IPCOT
      cannot be approved in the imbalance AFSC, airmen may be considered in an additional AFSC. The
      assignment OPR has final approval/disapproval authority.
      A4.8.3. Airmen notified of IPCOT approval have 30 calendar days from notification in which to take
      one of the following actions: obtain the full required retainability; decline to obtain the additional
      IPCOT retainability (MPFs only need to reclama the IPCOT, do not have the airman complete an AF
      Form 964), or request a delay in obtaining the retainability from the MPF Commander. Delays can
      only be considered for the reasons provided in Table 2.7.

A4.9. Release From, Cancellation of, or Curtailment of an Approved IPCOT.
      A4.9.1. Officers. See paragraph 2.12. In limited cases, if a replacement is available who can meet the
      same reporting date, an IPCOT may be canceled by the assignment OPR provided the officer has not
      entered it.
      A4.9.2. Airmen. Airmen may request release from an IPCOT provided they have not entered into it.
      If the cancellation request is approved, the new DEROS will be established as either the original
      DEROS or 10 months from the date of cancellation, whichever is greater, unless manning supports an
      earlier DEROS. An airman must complete at least the initial full prescribed tour, plus any previously
      approved DEROS extension. If an airman fails to obtain the required retainability for the IPCOT
      within 30 calendar days from approval notification, reclama the assignment but do not have the mem-
      ber complete a PCS declination statement (AF Form 964).
      A4.9.3. While every effort is made to honor the full length of an approved IPCOT, the MPF must
      advise members that curtailment and reassignment prior to the IPCOT DEROS may become neces-
      sary due to loss of authorizations, base or unit closure, promotion (only to grades of colonel or
      CMSgt), and so on.

A4.10. IPCOT Entitlements (see the JFTR, chapter 7, and AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program).
      A4.10.1. Members who will serve an IPCOT, and in certain circumstances their command sponsored
      dependents, may be entitled to travel and transportation allowances as provided in the JFTR, para-
      graph U7200. In no instance can these entitlements be used prior to completion of the member’s cur-
      rent tour.
      A4.10.2. Leave taken in conjunction with IPCOT travel and transportation entitlements is chargeable
      leave.

A4.11. Involuntary COT (ICOT). Selection of members for ICOTs may be directed by the assignment
OPR, with advance approval of HQ AFPC/DPAPP for lieutenant colonels and below and all airmen, or
AFCMOA for colonels, including selectees, when necessary to satisfy OS requirements. ICOTs will only
be used after less objectionable alternatives have been exhausted. Selection for ICOT is accomplished
according to the selection order prescribed in Table 3.3. and Table 3.4. Once selected for an ICOT, the
gaining MAJCOM may not change the end assignment without prior approval of the assignment OPR.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 277

         HOME-BASING (HB) AND FOLLOW-ON (FO) ASSIGNMENT PROGRAMS

A5.1. Purpose of the HB Program (see paragraph A5.6. for the FO program). The purpose of the
HB program is to reduce PCS costs and increase family stability. It does so by providing members who
meet program criteria and agree to certain conditions an assignment back to the same CONUS location or
long tour location in Alaska or Hawaii from which he or she departs.

A5.2. HB Program Criteria. To be eligible for the HB program, officers must be in the grade of Lt Col
or below and airmen in any grade must meet the program criteria in this paragraph and agree to the condi-
tions outlined in paragraph A5.3. and in Figure A5.1. To apply for a HB assignment, members must:
   A5.2.1. Have been selected for or elected to serve the OS unaccompanied short tour of 15 months or
   less, and
   A5.2.2. Not be currently serving an OS tour (unless at a long tour location in Alaska or Hawaii) (see
   paragraph A5.3.3.), and
   A5.2.3. Have or be eligible to obtain the PCS retainability for the HB assignment required by Table
   2.5. Retainability for approved HB assignments is obtained during normal OS returnee counseling.
   (NOTE: As an exception for only a CONUS HB assignment, members may apply provided they can
   obtain at least 7 months retainability upon completion of the OS tour (see Table 2.5., notes 5 and 6).
   For HB requests for long tour locations in Alaska or Hawaii members must be able to obtain 36
   months retainability in order to serve the full prescribed OS tour.), and
   A5.2.4. Not be en route to their first permanent duty station, and
   A5.2.5. Not apply for a Designated Location Move (DLM), and
   A5.2.6. Submit their HB application within 15 days of the initial PCS relocation briefing (or notifica-
   tion of IPCOT approval). A member unable to meet the 15 day suspense due to mission reasons or
   emergency leave only may apply immediately upon return with justification and commander’s con-
   currence. Late requests based on reasons other than these are not accepted.

A5.3. HB Restrictions/Limitations.
   A5.3.1. In exchange for advance assignment consideration, members participating in the HB program
   must agree not to use their entitlements to relocate their dependents to a designated place, claim DLA,
   or ship and/or store HHGs at government expense. Any claim against the government for the reloca-
   tion of dependents, shipment or storage of HHGs, or for DLA will result in cancellation of the HB
   assignment. However, participating in the HB program does not prohibit the member from taking any
   of these actions at his or her own expense if so desired. Members who want to participate in the HB
   program must agree to these criteria EXCEPT:
       A5.3.1.1. When the member is single, a single member parent, or is part of a military couple who
       will serve concurrent and separate unaccompanied short tours. These members may store HHGs
       at government expense by the most cost effective means (as determined by local TMO). However,
       any relocation of dependents to a designated location must be done at personal expense and DLA
       must not be claimed.
278                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


         A5.3.1.2. Members denied continued occupancy of government-owned or controlled quarters
         may move their dependents and HHGs off base (out of government quarters) only within the same
         city, town, or metropolitan area as prescribed by the JFTR and still retain their HB assignment
         without requesting an exception.
      A5.3.2. When required to reside off-base, members may ship HHGs to the unaccompanied short tour
      location if otherwise eligible as determined by TMO. When HHGs shipment is authorized, the mem-
      ber may retain the HB assignment without a waiver. The losing MPF verifies the requirement to live
      off-base through the ZEUS file 09YCOV4/JFTR/JFTR_TBL, or by contacting HQ AFPC/DPSFM.
      A5.3.3. In some instances, members currently serving an accompanied OS tour other than in Alaska
      or Hawaii may request a HB assignment at an accompanied OS tour as an exception to policy (for
      example, when the member’s spouse is foreign born and the requested HB location is the spouse’s
      home country, for single members with no dependents and no HHGs which would require storage
      (since storage facilities are not available at OS locations), etc.). One of the main reasons such assign-
      ments are not permitted routinely is that Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs) seldom cover depen-
      dents once the member departs the OS country on PCS. Also, these dependents cannot retain
      command sponsorship and the member can only receive the OS station allowances upon special
      approval of a request according to the procedures in AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel. For these
      and related reasons, members must demonstrate the capability to cope before submitting a request for
      an exception to their MPF for processing to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 and the assignment OPR.

A5.4. HB Application Procedures.
      A5.4.1. The MPF counsels all members selected for a dependent restricted OS tour and those who
      elect to serve a 15 month or less unaccompanied OS tour on the HB program during the initial PCS
      relocation briefing. These members must either apply or decline to apply for a HB assignment no
      later than 15 days after their initial relocation interview. This allows HQ AFPC sufficient time to pro-
      cess the request and make an early determination on the application, and allows the member time to
      make plans accordingly. It also allows the MPF enough time to publish and release PCS orders.
      Members apply for a HB by using the application in Figure A5.1. Members must read this application
      closely as it thoroughly explains their entitlements and what they agree to in return for a HB assign-
      ment.
      A5.4.2. The MPF Personnel Relocations Element submits HB applications via the PDS using PTI 550
      procedures according to AFCSM 36-699 on members with a PDD 90 or more days in the future. If a
      member is within 90 days of the projected departure date (PDD), HB choices are submitted by mes-
      sage to the appropriate assignment OPR. MPFs suspense all HB requests to ensure a reply is received
      from HQ AFPC. If a final decision on a HB request has not been received within 75 days of the mem-
      ber's PDD, the MPF should immediately contact the assignment OPR.
      A5.4.3. Members receive HB consideration only once, and a HB application takes priority over a FO
      application and is considered first.
      A5.4.4. Based on the possible mission impact, Wing Commanders review HB applications submitted
      by senior NCOs. This review requirement may be delegated to Group level, but the Wing Com-
      mander must sign a recommendation to disapprove a HB assignment application or request. A disap-
      proval recommendation must be fully justified and the senior NCO allowed to submit a statement on
      his or her behalf. The complete application is then forwarded to the parent MAJCOM. The MAJ-
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                279


   COM/DP will make a recommendation and forward the complete application to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1
   for a final determination.

A5.5. HB General Information.
   A5.5.1. Entitlements. The MPF must advise members that a HB application cannot be used to
   deny a member PCS entitlements. The application is a voluntary agreement by the member not to
   use PCS entitlements in exchange for advance assignment consideration. If, after approval of a HB
   assignment, the member must use a PCS entitlement he or she originally agreed not to use, that enti-
   tlement cannot be denied; however the HB assignment may be canceled.
      A5.5.1.1. Some members have personal requirements which may preclude them from entering
      into an agreement not to use PCS entitlements. If participating in the HB program would cause a
      financial or personal hardship, members are encouraged to use their PCS entitlements and not par-
      ticipate in this program. Exceptions to allow members to use their entitlements and receive
      advance assignment consideration will not be considered. Such exceptions to HB criteria would
      give a few members an unfair advantage over others who abide by HB criteria. In addition,
      advance consideration for assignments also reduces the available assignments to other OS short
      tour returnees.
   A5.5.2. Military Couples. When a member is married to another military member and will serve an
   unaccompanied OS tour of 15 months or less, the member is considered for a return (join spouse)
   assignment to the location of the spouse, unless join spouse intent code “H” (join spouse not desired)
   is reflected in the PDS or the member requests FO consideration as outlined in paragraph A5.10.2.
   A5.5.3. Approved HB Assignment for any OS Long Tour Location. Members with approved OS HB
   assignments who desire to have dependents remain in the OS area must comply with the requirements
   outlined in AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel.
   A5.5.4. PCS Orders. The MPF will not release PCS orders without a final HQ AFPC decision on a
   HB application. PCS orders must reflect the appropriate HB information according to AFI 36-2102,
   Base-Level Relocation Procedures, Attachment 5, or per paragraph A5.5.5. In addition, the proper
   assignment remark must be included in item 24 of the PCS order to ensure the FSO and TMO take
   actions consistent with the member’s HB agreement or advise the MPF to cancel.
   A5.5.5. Notification of Approval or Disapproval of HB Applications. When the MPF receives the
   HQ AFPC decision on a HB application, it produces three copies of the approval/disapproval notifica-
   tion. Give one copy to the member, file one copy in the UPRG (see AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel
   Records System, Attachment 2), and place one copy in the relocation folder. If the member declines
   participation in the HB/FO program file the "Home-Basing and/or Follow-on Program Assignment
   Application" in the UPRG and include the following statement in item 24 of the member’s PCS
   orders: “I do not desire to apply for a HB/FO assignment and understand I will not have another
   opportunity to apply at a later time.”
   A5.5.6. Voluntary Cancellation of a HB Assignment. A HB assignment is considered to be voluntar-
   ily canceled by the member when:
      A5.5.6.1. A member applies for a four month or longer extension of their OS tour. The MPF
      updates the extension request and in the transaction remarks indicates the member has a HB
      assignment which must be canceled to accept the extension. If the extension request is disap-
      proved, the HB assignment remains firm. A request for tour extensions of 3 month or less must
280                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


         indicate in the transaction remarks the member has a HB assignment which requires an adjustment
         to the RNLTD per paragraph 2.27. Also, members who extend their short OS tour may require
         additional retainability for the HB assignment--verification of retainability is required.
         A5.5.6.2. A member applies for and receives approval of a request for Humanitarian or EFMP
         assignment.
         A5.5.6.3. For airmen, requests for voluntary cancellation of HB assignment should be submitted
         not later than 150 days prior to member’s DEROS. Requests submitted within the 150 day time
         frame should include the humanitarian or hardship reason(s).
      A5.5.7. Involuntary Cancellation of a HB Assignment. Unlike a “normal” return assignment from
      OS, a HB assignment is made 14 to 18 months before the reporting date. Although the intent is that
      once a HB assignment is provided it remain firm, individual qualifications and AF requirements must
      remain the primary determinants. When canceling a HB assignment becomes unavoidable (due to
      base closure, unit deactivation, etc.) the member is given priority consideration for other assignment
      preferences. In addition, there are other circumstances when involuntary cancellation of a HB assign-
      ment may also be appropriate. When circumstances arise which may warrant involuntary cancellation
      of a HB assignment, the MPF must immediately notify HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 and the assignment OPR
      by message, with an information copy to the losing and gaining MAJCOM. An assignment made
      under the HB program may be involuntarily canceled when:
         A5.5.7.1. A member relocates dependents and/or ships or stores HHGs at government expense
         (for reasons other than being denied continued occupancy of government owned or controlled
         quarters), or
         A5.5.7.2. A member fails to comply with any of the provisions agreed to in the "Home-Basing
         and/or Follow-on Assignment Application."

A5.6. Purpose of the FO Program. The purpose of the FO program is to reduce PCS costs and increase
family stability. It does so by providing members who meet program criteria and agree to certain condi-
tions advance assignment consideration. Members may request consideration for assignment to a pre-
ferred CONUS location, or an OS long tour location subject to the limitations below.
      A5.6.1. If currently serving an accompanied OS tour and not currently assigned in Alaska or Hawaii,
      then members may request OS FO consideration for long tour locations in Alaska or Hawaii ONLY.
      A5.6.2. If currently serving an accompanied OS tour and not currently assigned in Alaska or Hawaii,
      then members may request OS FO consideration for long tour locations other than Alaska or Hawaii
      ONLY as an exception to policy as shown in paragraph A5.8.4.

A5.7. FO Program Criteria. To be eligible for the FO program, members must meet the program crite-
ria in this paragraph and agree to the conditions outlined in paragraph A5.8. and in Figure A5.1. To apply
for a FO assignment, members must:
      A5.7.1. Have been selected for or elected to serve the OS unaccompanied short tour of 15 months or
      less (includes IPCOTs and COTs), and
      A5.7.2. Have or be eligible to obtain the FO PCS retainability required by Table 2.5. for the kind of
      FO PCS. Retainability for an approved FO assignment must be obtained within 30 days of approval
      notification, and
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 281


   A5.7.3. Not be en route to their first permanent duty station as an accession, and
   A5.7.4. Not apply for a Designated Location Move (DLM), and
   A5.7.5. Submit their FO application within 15 days of the initial PCS relocation briefing (or notifica-
   tion of IPCOT/COT approval). A member unable to meet the 15 day suspense due to mission reasons
   or emergency leave only may apply immediately upon return with justification and commander’s con-
   currence. Late requests based on reasons other than these are not accepted.

A5.8. FO Restrictions/Limitations.
   A5.8.1. In exchange for advance assignment consideration, members participating in the FO program
   must agree not to use their entitlements to relocate their dependents and HHGs to a place other than
   the FO location, claim DLA (for a move to other than the FO location), or store HHGs at government
   expense. Any claim against the government for the relocation of dependents or shipment of HHGs to
   other than the FO location, for storage of HHGs, or for DLA will result in cancellation of the FO
   assignment. However, participating in the FO program does not prohibit the member from taking any
   of these actions at his or her own expense if so desired. All members wanting to participate in the FO
   program must agree to these criteria EXCEPT:
      A5.8.1.1. When the member is single, a single member parent, or is part of a military couple who
      will serve concurrent but separate unaccompanied short tours. These members may store HHGs
      at government expense by the most cost effective means (as determined by local TMO). However,
      any relocation of dependents to a designated location (other than the FO location) must be done at
      personal expense and DLA must not be claimed.
      A5.8.1.2. Members denied continued occupancy of government-owned or controlled quarters
      may move their dependents and HHGs off base (out of government quarters) only within the same
      city, town, or metropolitan area as prescribed by the JFTR and still retain their FO assignment
      without requesting an exception.
   A5.8.2. Since storage of HHGs at government expense is not allowed under the FO program, mem-
   bers should not ship HHGs to the FO location at government expense when they do not intend to
   establish a household within the FO vicinity (daily commuting distance from FO base and household).
   By not establishing a household, storage of the HHGs will be required, but is not authorized under the
   FO program. Doing so may result in cancellation of the FO assignment.
   A5.8.3. Members may ship HHGs to the unaccompanied short tour location as shown in AFI 24-502
   when required to reside off-base and when otherwise eligible as determined by TMO. When HHGs
   shipment is authorized, the member may retain the FO assignment without a waiver. The losing MPF
   verifies the requirement to live off-base through the ZEUS file 09YCOV4/JFTR/JFTR_TBL, or by
   contacting HQ AFPC/DPSFM.
   A5.8.4. Members currently serving an accompanied OS tour other than in Alaska or Hawaii may
   request a FO assignment to an accompanied OS tour (other than Alaska or Hawaii) as an exception to
   policy. For example, when the member’s spouse is foreign born and the requested FO location is the
   spouse’s home country. One of the main reasons such assignments are not permitted on a routine basis
   is Status of Forces Agreements (SOFA) seldom cover dependents once the member departs a foreign
   country on PCS. Similarly, SOFAs seldom cover dependents who arrive in a foreign country in
   advance of the member’s arrival in PCS status. Also, these dependents cannot obtain or retain com-
   mand sponsorship, and the member can only receive the OS station allowances upon special approval
282                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      of a request according to procedures in AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel. For these and related
      reasons, members must acknowledge these circumstances and provide convincing evidence of their
      ability to cope in their request for an exception. The MPF will forward the request to HQ AFPC/
      DPAPP1 for further consideration. Approval may require contact with the losing and/or gaining OS
      MAJCOM and, in turn, the countries involved to verify on a case-by-case basis the circumstances
      dependents might face.

A5.9. FO Application Procedures.
      A5.9.1. The MPF counsels all members selected for a dependent restricted OS tour and those who
      elect to serve a 15 month or less unaccompanied OS tour on the FO program during the initial PCS
      relocation briefing. These members must either apply or decline to apply for a FO assignment no later
      than 15 days after their initial relocation interview. This allows HQ AFPC sufficient time to process
      the request and make an early determination on the application, and allows the member time to make
      plans accordingly. It also allows the MPF enough time to publish and release PCS orders. Members
      apply for a FO by using the application in Figure A5.1. Members must read this application closely as
      it thoroughly explains their entitlements and what they agree to in return for a FO assignment.
      A5.9.2. The MPF Personnel Relocations Element submits FO applications via the PDS using PTI 550
      procedures according to AFCSM 36-699 on members with a PDD 90 or more days in the future. If a
      member is within 90 days of the PDD, FO choices are submitted by message to the appropriate assign-
      ment OPR. MPFs suspense all FO requests to ensure a reply is received from HQ AFPC. If a final
      decision on a FO request has not been received within 75 days of the member's PDD, the MPF should
      immediately contact the assignment OPR.
      A5.9.3. Members receive FO consideration only once so it is in their best interest that they provide
      the maximum number of choices in priority sequence. Members may apply for up to 8 CONUS loca-
      tions (either bases, states, or locales) and up to 8 OS locations (bases or countries), which the MPF
      updates in the PTI 550 “AMU Remarks.” If both CONUS and OS locations are indicated, OS prefer-
      ences will be considered first. Remember that if a member applies for both HB and FO, the HB
      request is considered first. For members of military couples, see paragraph A5.10.2. below.

A5.10. FO General Information.
      A5.10.1. Entitlements. The MPF must advise members that a FO application cannot be used to
      deny a member PCS entitlements. The application is a voluntary agreement by the member not to
      use PCS entitlements in exchange for advance assignment consideration. If, after approval of a FO
      assignment, the member must use a PCS entitlement he or she originally agreed not to use, that enti-
      tlement cannot be denied; however the FO assignment may be canceled.
         A5.10.1.1. Some members have personal requirements which may preclude them from entering
         into an agreement not to use PCS entitlements. If participating in the FO program would cause a
         financial or personal hardship, members are encouraged to use their PCS entitlements and not par-
         ticipate in this program. Exceptions to allow members to use their entitlements (other than for
         relocation to the FO location) and receive advance assignment consideration will not be consid-
         ered. Such exceptions to FO criteria would give a few members an unfair advantage over others
         who abide by FO criteria. In addition, advance consideration for assignments also reduces the
         available assignments to other OS short tour returnees.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                               283


  A5.10.2. Military Couples. When one member of a military couple is selected to serve a dependent
  restricted tour or elects to serve the unaccompanied OS tour of 15 months or less, that member is con-
  sidered for a return (join spouse) assignment to the location of the spouse, unless join spouse intent
  code “H” (join spouse not desired) is reflected in the PDS or one of the following applies:
     A5.10.2.1. If no requirement exists at the spouse’s location, the returning member’s FO prefer-
     ences will be considered for both members at that time. A requirement must exist for both mem-
     bers.
     A5.10.2.2. When both members of a military couple (with join spouse intent codes “A” or “B”)
     are selected to serve concurrent but separate unaccompanied short tours of 15 months or less they
     may apply for FO assignments provided they each list the same preferences in the same order on
     their respective FO applications.
     A5.10.2.3. (Airmen Only). Members selected for an OS assignment, including when a require-
     ment exists at their current base upon completion of their unaccompanied OS short tour, may
     request follow-on consideration and join spouse assignment to another CONUS location if the
     spouse who remains at the current CONUS base will have 6 years TOS or more as of the DEROS
     (month/year) of the member returning from OS. The CONUS spouse’s join spouse intent code
     must be “A” or “B” and the PTI 550 application must contain in the Remarks section: “Fol-
     low-On and Join Spouse Request-6 Years TOS.”
     A5.10.2.4. (Airmen Only). Members selected for an OS assignment, including when a require-
     ment exists at their current location upon completion of their unaccompanied OS short tour, may
     request follow-on and join spouse assignment consideration to an OS location. The CONUS
     spouse’s join spouse intent code must be “A” or “B” and the PTI 550 application must contain in
     the Remarks section: “Follow-On and OS Join Spouse Request.”
  A5.10.3. Approved FO Assignment to any OS Location. Members with approved OS FO assign-
  ments who elect to have dependents remain in the OS area or relocate to the FO assignment location
  must comply with the requirements outlined in AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel. All dependents
  must be medically cleared for government funded travel prior to the member’s departure to the unac-
  companied short tour location. In addition, members who desire to relocate dependents and/or ship
  HHGs to an OS FO location must be counseled in detail by the MPF and TMO on how the SOFA may
  impact unaccompanied dependents and HHGs in the OS area.
  A5.10.4. PCS Orders. The MPF will not release PCS orders without a final HQ AFPC decision on a
  FO application. PCS orders must reflect the appropriate FO information according to AFI 36-2102,
  Base-Level Relocation Procedures, Attachment 5, or per paragraph A5.10.5. In addition, the proper
  assignment remark must be included in item 24 of the PCS order to ensure the FSO and TMO take
  actions consistent with the FO agreement or advise the MPF to cancel.
  A5.10.5. Notification of Approval or Disapproval of FO Applications. When the MPF receives the
  HQ AFPC decision on a FO application, it produces three copies of the approval/disapproval notifica-
  tion. Give one copy to the member, file one copy in the UPRG (see AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel
  Records System, Attachment 2), and place one copy in the relocation folder. If the member declines
  participation in the FO program file the "Home-Basing and/or Follow-on Program Assignment Appli-
  cation" in the UPRG and include the following statement in item 24 of the member’s PCS orders: “I
  do not desire to apply for a HB/FO assignment and understand I will not have another opportunity to
  apply at a later time.”

      A5.10.6. Voluntary Cancellation of a FO Assignment. A FO assignment is considered to be volun-
      tarily canceled by the member when:
         A5.10.6.1. A member applies for a four month or longer extension of their OS tour. The MPF
         updates the extension request and in the transaction remarks indicates the member has a FO
         assignment which must be canceled to accept the extension. If the extension request is disap-
         proved, the FO assignment remains firm. A request for tour extensions of 3 months or less must
         indicate in the transaction remarks the member has a FO assignment which requires an adjustment
         to the RNLTD per paragraph 2.27. Also, members who extend their short OS tour may require
         additional retainability for the FO assignment--verification of retainability is required per para-
         graph 2.29.
         A5.10.6.2. A member applies for and receives approval of a request for Humanitarian or EFMP
         assignment.
      A5.10.7. Involuntary Cancellation of a FO Assignment. Unlike a “normal” assignment from OS, a
      FO assignment is made 14 to 18 months before the reporting date. Although the intent is that once a
      FO assignment is provided it remain firm, individual qualifications and AF requirements must remain
      the primary determinants. When canceling a FO assignment becomes unavoidable (due to base clo-
      sure, unit deactivation, etc.) the member is given priority consideration for other assignment prefer-
      ences. In addition, there are other circumstances when involuntary cancellation of a FO assignment
      may also be appropriate. When circumstances arise which may warrant involuntary cancellation of a
      FO assignment, the MPF must immediately notify HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 and the assignment OPR by
      message, with an information copy to the losing and gaining MAJCOM. An assignment made under
      the FO program may be involuntarily canceled when:
         A5.10.7.1. A member relocates dependents and/or ships HHGs to a location other than the FO at
         government expense, receives DLA for movement of dependents to a location other than the FO,
         or stores HHGs at government expense (for reasons other than being denied continued occupancy
         of government owned or controlled quarters), or
         A5.10.7.2. A member fails to comply with any of the provisions agreed to in the "Home-Basing
         and/or Follow-on Assignment Application."

MEMORANDUM FOR MSS/ (OFFICE SYMBOL)                                                                (date)
FROM: (Name and functional address symbol)
SUBJECT: Home-Basing and/or Follow-on Assignment Application
1. I (grade, name, SSN, AFSC), have an assignment to (location, country) where the unaccompanied tour
is 15 months or less and I have elected to serve the unaccompanied tour length at that location.
2. I am applying for a (home-basing only; follow-on only; both home-basing and follow-on) assignment
to (list up to eight CONUS bases, regions, locales, states, and/or eight overseas bases and/or countries in
priority sequence). I understand if I request both home-basing and follow-on assignment consideration I
will be considered first for home-basing.
3. I understand that based on my unaccompanied short tour assignment, I have an entitlement to move
my dependents and household goods (HHGs) at government expense; however, as a consideration of
receiving a home-basing or follow-on assignment, I agree not to use these entitlements except as outlined
below.
4. I am aware that this is the only application I can submit for home-basing and/or follow-on assignment
consideration and I must return the application within 15 days of my initial PCS relocation interview
or notification of IPCOT/COT approval. For short notice assignments, the application must be
returned within 3 days of initial relocation interview.
5. (For Home-Basing Only) If my request for home-basing assignment is approved I understand and
agree that I may:
           a. not move my dependents at government expense, but I may move them at personal
              expense, and
           b. not ship HHGs at government expense, but I may ship HHGs at personal expense, and
           c. not store HHGs in nontemporary storage at government expense (NOTE: See paragraph
              7d below for an exception for single members, single member parents, and military
              couples.), but I may store them at personal expense during my unaccompanied OS short
              tour assignment, and
           d. ship my privately owned vehicle at government expense to the OS location if
              otherwise eligible.
 6. (For Follow-On Only) If my request for follow-on assignment is approved I understand and agree
that I may:
           a. not move my dependents at government expense except to the follow-on location, but I
              may move them to any desired location at personal expense, and
           b. not claim Dislocation Allowance (DLA) unless I'm moving my dependents to the fol-
              low-on location.
286                                                 AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


           c. not ship HHGs at government expense to other than the follow-on location (and only if I
              or my agent will accept delivery of my HHGs upon their arrival at the follow-on location),
              but I may ship HHGs to any desired location at personal expense, and
           d. not store HHGs in nontemporary storage at government expense (NOTE: See paragraph
              7d for an exception for single members, single member parents, and military cou-
              ples.), but I may store them at personal expense during my unaccompanied OS short tour
              assignment, and
           e. ship my privately owned vehicle at government expense to the OS location if
              otherwise eligible.
 7. (For Both Home-Basing and Follow-on) I understand that:
           a. if denied continued occupancy of government-owned or controlled quarters my depen-
              dents and HHGs may be moved at government expense only within the same city, town,
              or metropolitan area as prescribed by the JFTR, paragraph U5355-C.
           b. if I take any action contrary to the above agreements without prior HQ
              AFPC/DPAPP1 approval of a request for exception my home-basing or follow-on assign-
              ment will be canceled.
           c. my home-basing or follow-on assignment is subject to cancellation due to unavoidable
              changes in Air Force requirements (i.e., base closure, change in mission or weapons sys-
              tem, etc.) or individual qualifications (i.e., loss of AFSC, promotion, etc.)
           d. as an exception, if I am a single member, a single member parent, or part of a military cou-
              ple who will serve a concurrent but separate unaccompanied short tour, I can store HHGs
              at government expense by the most cost effective means (as determined by the local
              TMO).
8. (For AF join spouse couples.) I have been counseled on the rules concerning home-basing and fol-
low-on assignments and join spouse eligibility (Attachment 8). I understand that since only one of us
will be serving an unaccompanied OS short tour, the first consideration will be a return assignment to my
spouse’s location unless join spouse intent code is "H." I further understand that if no requirement exists
at my spouse's location, my follow-on preferences will be considered and my spouse may, if otherwise eli-
gible, apply for join spouse assignment to my follow-on location.
(Use the following when both members of an AF couple will serve concurrent but separate OS short
tours.) I understand I am eligible for a follow-on assignment and confirm my preferences are the same,
and are listed in the same order as my spouse’s. I understand that if I request different locations from my
spouse I am considered to be voluntarily creating family separation and a subsequent join spouse assign-
ment or change of assignment (once selected for a follow-on) to join spouse is not authorized.

Figure A5.2. HB/FO Entitlement Fact Sheet.
                                    HB/FO Entitlement Fact Sheet
   You have recently been selected for a dependent restricted tour or have elected to serve an unaccompa-
nied short tour of 15 months or less. Because of your PCS selection, you are authorized certain entitle-
ments associated with the PCS. According to the Joint Federal Travel Regulations, all members selected
for a dependent restricted tour or an unaccompanied short tour are authorized to relocate their dependents,
claim Dislocation Allowance (DLA), and ship and/or store HHGs to any place in the CONUS as desig-
nated by the member. Members may also relocate dependents, and ship and/or store HHGs if the desig-
nated location is in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States.
However, since these locations are considered OS by AF definition, members must apply for dependent
travel in accordance with AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel. As a note of interest, dependents must be
medically cleared for OS travel prior to your departure to the unaccompanied short tour location. Appli-
cations for dependent travel must be processed through your MPF to the appropriate MAJCOM for
approval/disapproval.
   Because of the type of OS tour you will serve, you are eligible to apply for a HB assignment, a FO
assignment, or both. If you apply for a HB assignment you are asking to be reassigned back to your cur-
rent base. If you apply for a FO assignment, you are asking for an advance assignment to a desired loca-
tion (either in the CONUS or OS) prior to your departure to the short tour location. If you apply for both
types of assignment, HB consideration takes priority and will be considered first.
   By electing to participate in the HB program you must agree not to use your PCS entitlements to relo-
cate dependents, claim DLA, and ship and/or store HHGs at government expense. By electing to partic-
ipate in the FO program, you must agree not to use your PCS entitlements to relocate dependents, claim
DLA, and ship HHGs (except to the FO location), or store HHGs at government expense. Since the HB
and FO programs exist to reduce PCS costs and increase family stability, every effort will be made to pro-
vide you with an advance assignment (consistent with the best interests of the AF) in exchange for your
agreement not to use your PCS entitlements. Members may take any of the actions concerning movement
of dependents/HHGs at personal expense without risking cancellation of an approved HB or FO assign-
ment. (EXCEPTION: Single members, single member parents, and members of a military couple who
will serve concurrent but separate unaccompanied short tours may store HHGs at government expense by
the most cost effective means [as determined by local TMO]).

   Figure A5.1. in AFI 36-2110, Assignments, "Home-Basing and/or Follow-on Assignment Applica-
tion," clearly outlines your agreement with the AF. Make sure you read the application carefully and
understand your agreement with the AF. If you don't understand something, ask your MPF for clarifi-
cation.
   If you receive an approved FO assignment you may move your dependents and HHGs to the FO loca-
tion at government expense, as well as claim DLA for this move. However, if you move your depen-
dents to a location other than the FO location you must do so and store all HHGs at your own expense,
and not claim DLA as explained above. We realize relocating your dependents at your own expense to a
location other than the FO may be cost prohibitive. If you feel this will cause you a financial or personal
hardship we encourage you to use your entitlements as outlined in the first paragraph rather than partici-
pate in the FO program.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  289


   If you do move your dependents and HHGs to a location other than the FO at your own expense while
you serve the unaccompanied OS short tour, you may still be authorized some reimbursement upon your
return. The amount will depend on the location where you relocated your dependents in relation to the FO
location. According to the JFTR, reimbursement for travel and transportation allowances will not exceed
the amount you were authorized from the old CONUS PDS to the new PDS. However, the amount of
reimbursement you receive may be less if the dependent's actual physical location is closer to the FO loca-
tion than it would have been from the old CONUS PDS. The following scenarios should help clarify this
limitation.
           •   SCENARIO 1: Provides an example of when a member is eligible for reimbursement
               equaling but not exceeding the amount from the old CONUS PDS to the new PDS.

    You are currently stationed at Randolph AFB, TX with an assignment to Korea and a FO assignment
to McGuire AFB, NJ. While you serve your OS short tour you’ve decided to relocate your dependents
and HHGs at your own expense to Mom and Dad's home town of Seattle, WA. You depart for Korea.
You return twelve months later and go to Seattle to pick up your family. You now relocate your family
from Seattle to McGuire AFB. Even though the distance from Seattle to McGuire AFB is greater than
that from Randolph AFB to McGuire AFB, you are only eligible for reimbursement for the amount cred-
itable for the distance from Randolph AFB (old PDS) to McGuire AFB (new PDS).
           •   SCENARIO 2: Provides an example of when a member’s reimbursement will be less
               than that from the old CONUS PDS.
   You are currently stationed at Randolph AFB, TX with an assignment to Korea and a FO assignment
to McGuire AFB, NJ. While you serve your OS short tour you’ve decided to relocate your dependents
and HHGs at your own expense to Mom and Dad's home town in Pennsylvania. You depart for Korea.
You return twelve months later and go to Pennsylvania to pick up your family. You now relocate your
family from Pennsylvania to McGuire AFB. Based on these circumstances, the government will reim-
burse you only for the actual dependent travel from Pennsylvania to McGuire AFB. You cannot claim
reimbursement for the travel done at personal expense from Randolph AFB to Pennsylvania.
   Please keep in mind these scenarios only illustrate two different situations involving the movement of
dependents and HHGs at personal expense, and the reimbursement you may be authorized when you
complete your FO assignment travel. If neither scenario fits your situation, contact the MPF Personnel
Relocations Element for additional counseling prior to applying for a HB or FO assignment. It is essential
you understand all entitlements associated with this program.

  HOSTILE FIRE AND IMMINENT DANGER AREA REASSIGNMENT OR DEFERMENT

A6.1. Purpose. There are two separate assignment provisions addressed below.
      A6.1.1. One is to allow one or more immediate family members to request reassignment from, or
      deferment from assignment to, a hostile fire or imminent danger area when that family has suffered a
      casualty (see paragraph A6.2.7. below) incident to duty in a currently designated hostile fire or immi-
      nent danger area.
      A6.1.2. The other policy applies to assignment of members hospitalized because of hostile fire
      action.

A6.2. General Provisions for Immediate Family Members.
      A6.2.1. These provisions do not apply during periods of war or national emergency declared by Con-
      gress.
      A6.2.2. Members must be at least 18 years of age to serve in a hostile fire or imminent danger area.
      A6.2.3. Hostile fire and imminent danger areas are designated by geographical area with a beginning
      date and a termination date in the DoD Pay and Entitlements Manual.
      A6.2.4. Assignment to duty in a designated hostile fire or imminent danger area is shared as equitably
      as practical by all similarly qualified members, except as indicated herein or in Attachment 9, Air-
      crew Family Member Assignment and Attachment 11, Sole Surviving Son or Daughter. Assignment
      of military couples, including assignment at the same time, to the same or different hostile fire or
      imminent danger areas is not precluded.
      A6.2.5. Assignment includes TDY or PCS.
      A6.2.6. Only the member may initiate a request for deferment or reassignment. A request may not be
      initiated by someone on behalf of a member.
      A6.2.7. When a military member is killed or dies, is in a captured or missing status or has been deter-
      mined by the Veterans Administration (VA) or a military Service to be 100 percent physically or men-
      tally disabled as a result of an act committed by an individual, group, or country hostile to the United
      States or in direct support of operations against such a hostile force while serving in a currently desig-
      nated hostile fire or imminent danger area, other members of the same immediate family (as defined
      below) will be exempt, upon request, from serving in the same or any currently designated hostile fire
      or imminent danger area, or if they are already serving in such an area, they will be reassigned from
      that area. The intent is when a family has suffered a casualty incident to service in a currently desig-
      nated hostile fire or imminent danger area, to not expose the remaining immediate family members to
      further casualties in the same or any other currently designated hostile fire or imminent danger area.
      However, when an area in which a family member became a casualty ceases to be designated as a hos-
      tile fire or imminent danger area, then members of that family may again be assigned to a hostile fire
      or imminent danger area. It is not a requirement for the member who was a casualty to be living or to
      still be on active duty, as long as the area in which the member became a casualty is still currently des-
      ignated.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                   291


   A6.2.8. For this policy, a member's family members are:
       A6.2.8.1. Parents. This includes stepparents, parents by adoption, and those who stood in the
       place of a parent for at least 5 years immediately preceding the initial entry on active duty of the
       member who died, is missing or captured, or 100 percent disabled.
       A6.2.8.2. Brothers and sisters. This includes stepbrothers and stepsisters, brothers or sisters by
       adoption, or half brothers or half sisters in the household at the time the member who died, is miss-
       ing or captured, or 100 percent disabled initially entered active duty.
       A6.2.8.3. Spouse.
       A6.2.8.4. Natural child.
       A6.2.8.5. Legally adopted child.
       A6.2.8.6. Stepchild, if the child was a member of the household at the time the member or former
       member died, was missing or captured, or was determined to be 100 percent disabled.
       A6.2.8.7. An illegitimate child to whose support a male member or former member has been
       ordered judicially to contribute, or of whom he has been decreed judicially to be the father, or of
       whom he has acknowledged in writing under oath that he is the father.
       A6.2.8.8. A person for whom the member stood in place of a parent for at least 5 years immedi-
       ately preceding the date on which the member or former member died, was missing or captured, or
       determined to be 100 percent disabled.

A6.3. Application Procedures. Applications should be submitted using the format shown in Figure
A6.1. within 15 calendar days of notification of selection for PCS or TDY, or as soon after becoming eli-
gible as practical. Members will submit requests to their unit commander.

A6.4. Commander Actions. Commanders will assist members with their requests as necessary. Com-
manders may disapprove requests when they do not meet the criteria. When a commander recommends
approval and while a request is pending, the commander will take immediate action to locally assign the
member to other than hazardous duty. If this is not possible, a commander may temporarily assign
(TDY) a member out of the designated area. When commanders recommend approval, they will forward
requests to the member's servicing MPF.

A6.5. MPF Actions. MPFs will provide guidance to members on their request and assist commanders as
needed. Upon receipt from a commander of a request recommended for approval, the MPF will review
and forward to the member's MAJCOM. For approved requests, the MPF will update assignment limita-
tion code (ALC) "6," Family Member Restriction (Hostile Fire Area) per Table 2.2.

A6.6. MAJCOM Actions. MAJCOMs (or equivalent) may disapprove requests which do not meet the
criteria for approval. When a request merits approval, the MAJCOM (or equivalent) approves it and
advises the MPF and directs update of ALC "6." As applicable, the MAJCOM will direct or request ter-
mination of TDY, request reassignment or request cancellation of an assignment from the assignment

verifying the status of family members.

be approved to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1. HQ AFPC may disapprove requests for exception or submit those
which merit approval through channels to DoD for final approval/disapproval.

A6.8. General Provisions for Members Hospitalized. Members who have been hospitalized for 30 or
more calendar days because of a specific hostile fire action resulting from combat service will not be
returned to the hostile fire area during the same tour in which they were wounded. Members reassigned
under this provision will be eligible for subsequent hostile fire tours. Members may return voluntarily to
a hostile fire area earlier if they are medically qualified. This provision does not apply to members hospi-
talized for injury, accident, or illness not attributable to hostile fire action. Self-inflicted wounds and
other non-combat causes are specifically excluded.

                             ASSIGNMENT OF MILITARY COUPLES

A8.1. General Policy. Each member of a military couple is serving in his or her own right. This means
military couples must fulfill the obligations inherent to all AF members and they are considered for
assignments to fill valid manning requirements and must perform duties which require the skills in which
they are trained and experienced subject to their PCS eligibility. Provided this criteria is met, military
couples may be considered for assignment where they can maintain a joint residence. Military couples
must share the responsibility for reducing family separation. They should not make decisions on future
service, career development, or family planning based on the assumption they will always be assigned to
the same location or join spouse assignment is guaranteed. Military couples, like members with a civilian
spouse, should expect periods of separation during their careers. When a join spouse assignment is not in
the best interests of the AF, then, regardless of the provisions in this attachment, join spouse assignment
will not be made.

A8.2. Who Is Eligible for Join Spouse Assignment Consideration. You are eligible for join spouse
assignment consideration if:
   A8.2.1. You are on extended active duty with the AF and your spouse is also on extended active duty
   with the AF or one of the other US military services (excludes military services of foreign countries)
   and you and your spouse are not ineligible for consideration for any of the reasons in paragraph A8.3.,
   and
   A8.2.2. You meet all PCS eligibility requirements established in this instruction (such as TOS, retain-
   ability, quality control, etc.) and
   A8.2.3. You have join spouse intent code “A” or “B” and
   A8.2.4. You or your spouse are not scheduled for reassignment, separation, retirement, or release
   from active duty within 12 months from the date you will join.
   A8.2.5. Join spouse assignments are permitted along with the following voluntary assignment pro-
   grams if the provisions above and the criteria for each assignment program are met.
       A8.2.5.1. Reassignment to or from a CONUS-isolated station (see Attachment 3).
       A8.2.5.2. OS tour volunteer program (see paragraph 3.7.).
       A8.2.5.3. Humanitarian/EFMP assignment (see Attachment 7).
       A8.2.5.4. Home-Basing and Follow-on (see Attachment 5).
       A8.2.5.5. VSBAP (Airmen only) (see Attachment 14).
       A8.2.5.6. First-term airman BOP (see Attachment 2).
       A8.2.5.7. Threatened Person Assignment (see Attachment 12)

A8.3. Who Is Not Eligible for Join Spouse Assignment Consideration. You are not eligible for join
spouse assignment:
296                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      A8.3.1. If your spouse is a member of any US Reserve or Guard component but is not serving on
      extended active duty.
      A8.3.2. If your spouse is a member of any US Reserve or Guard component who is on active duty for
      training, or on active duty to fill a specific Reserve or Guard manpower authorization or position at a
      predetermined location for a specified period of time. In other words, if your spouse is not subject to
      the PCS criteria outlined in this instruction, then you are ineligible for join spouse assignment consid-
      eration.
      A8.3.3. If your spouse is a member of the US Coast Guard.
      A8.3.4. If your spouse is a non-military employee of the US Government (for example, Civil Ser-
      vice).
      A8.3.5. If you do not meet all PCS eligibility criteria established in this instruction (such as TOS,
      retainability, quality control, etc.).
      A8.3.6. When join spouse intent code is "H." When one member is selected for assignment with
      intent code "H", a join spouse assignment to that location at a later time is not authorized. Join spouse
      assignment will not be considered until the subsequent PCS of you or your spouse provided join
      spouse intent code is "A" or "B." However, you may receive an assignment to your spouse's location
      if you are eligible under some other assignment program.
         A8.3.6.1. Changing join spouse intent code to "H" after selection for join spouse assignment will
         not result in automatic cancellation of the assignment. Normal reclama procedures apply and the
         decision to cancel the join spouse assignment will be made by the assignment OPR based on the
         best interests of the AF. A member who requests and has a join spouse assignment canceled as
         provided in this paragraph does so with the understanding he or she created the family separation.
         A join spouse assignment to that same location at a later time is not authorized. Join spouse
         assignment will not be considered until the subsequent PCS of you or your spouse provided join
         spouse intent code is "A" or "B." However, you may receive an assignment to your spouse's loca-
         tion if you are eligible under some other assignment program.
      A8.3.7. If you or your spouse are scheduled for reassignment, separation, retirement, or release from
      active duty within 12 months from the date you will join.
      A8.3.8. To OS locations where there is no government-approved accompanied housing or where
      election of an accompanied tour is not an option for either member. NOTE: In the event both mem-
      bers should receive assignments (regardless of how it occurred) to the same or adjacent depen-
      dent-restricted locations, the MPF will reclama the assignment of the member selected last (includes
      when the marriage takes place after assignment selection).
      A8.3.9. To locations not considered in proximity or clustered for join spouse assignment purposes as
      described in paragraph A8.7.2. Other options such as retraining (airmen, see AFI 36-2626, Airman
      Retraining Program) or DAFSC changes (officers, see paragraph 2.45.) must be considered first as
      explained in paragraph A8.7.1.
      A8.3.10. When your spouse's reassignment was the result of a self-initiated voluntary request under
      either the CONUS assignment exchange program (Attachment 10) or the expanded permissive
      reassignment program (Attachment 10). NOTE: Applications for these type assignments may be
      submitted simultaneously by both members of a military couple. However, if only one member of a
      military couple desires this type assignment consideration, his or her join spouse intent code must be
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 297


   “H” in order to be considered for either of these programs. A member who proceeds on one of these
   assignments does so with the understanding he or she created the family separation. Join spouse
   assignment will not be considered until a subsequent PCS of you or your spouse provided join spouse
   intent code is "A" or "B." However, you may receive an assignment to your spouse's location if eligi-
   ble under some other assignment program.
   A8.3.11. Based on intended/planned marriages.
   A8.3.12. If your spouse is attending a training course and has less than 12 months remaining until
   graduation (or will have less than 12 months remaining upon your arrival).
   A8.3.13. Your spouse is a member of the military service of a foreign country.

A8.4. Documenting Marriages of Military Couples. The AF Form 1048, Military Spouse Informa-
tion, is the primary document used to record the marriage of a military couple and contains the SSN and
military status of the spouse. The AF Form 1048 must be completed as soon as possible following the
marriage of two military members (including an AF member's marriage to a US Reserve or Guard mem-
ber even though subsequent join spouse assignment may not be authorized ). It is self-explanatory and
completed in original only (typewritten or pen, as long as it is legible). Information captured in the PDS
from the AF Form 1048 identifies the member as part of a military couple and can be used by command-
ers in identifying personnel required to document dependent care arrangements according to AFI
36-2908, Family Care Plans.
   A8.4.1. The MPF must verify the marriage from the marriage certificate at the time the initial AF
   Form 1048 is completed. The MPF updates the required information from the AF Form 1048 in PDS
   and files the form in the UPRG. Any change in marital or military status must be reported to the MPF
   by military couples and join spouse assignment information (and AAC 32) deleted from the PDS upon
   divorce, legal separation, death of the spouse, or separation or retirement of the spouse.

A8.5. How Military Couples Receive Join Spouse Assignment Consideration. The characteristics of
the enlisted and officer assignment systems affects how join spouse assignment consideration is provided.
The enlisted assignment selection process makes extensive use of the computer-match while officer
assignment matches are a manual process. For example, the majority of enlisted assignments to OS loca-
tions (regardless of volunteer status) are computer-matched based on PCS eligibility, grade, and AFSC,
and then reviewed and validated by an assignment NCO. For these computer-matched assignments, the
computer automatically considers the spouse for join spouse assignment, and provided the eligibility cri-
teria are met, selects the spouse. On the other hand, all officer assignments are manually-worked by HQ
AFPC assignment officers to identified requirements. However, the basic rule that a requirement must
exist for the spouse's AFSC does not differ in either system.
   A8.5.1. Officers. Officers can influence their assignment by indicating the same locations as assign-
   ment preferences. They should maintain periodic contact with their respective assignment officers
   and ensure their join spouse intent code remains current.
   A8.5.2. Airmen. When currently assigned to the same location (provided neither has been selected
   for PCS), completion of the AF Form 1048 provides continuous join spouse assignment consideration
   unless coded otherwise (see paragraph A8.6.1. for those situations requiring an application). It is the
   couple's responsibility to let it be known in advance they desire join spouse assignment consideration
   by completing the AF Form 1048. Improper completion or failure to complete the form jeopardizes
298                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      join spouse assignment opportunities. Join spouse assignment desires indicated on the AF Form
      1048 take priority over any other individual assignment preferences listed in the PDS (i.e., If
      your intent code is "B" the main consideration is to try and keep you together, not necessarily at
      a base of choice. While location preferences are considered, the join spouse intent code takes
      priority). The AF Form 1048 allows airmen to indicate the extent of join spouse assignment consid-
      eration desired by use of one of the following join spouse intent codes:
              Code "A" Desire join spouse to CONUS or any OS tour. NOTE: Join spouse assignment to
      the same dependent-restricted short tour location is prohibited. By having intent code "A," if your
      spouse is selected for reassignment to a dependent -restricted location, you will be considered for a
      concurrent, but separate, reassignment to a dependent-restricted or unaccompanied short tour loca-
      tion.
              Code "B" Desire join spouse to CONUS or any accompanied OS tour.
              Code "H" Join spouse assignment not desired. NOTE: If one member of the couple elects
      this code the PDS will automatically update the spouse's code to "H" to preclude erroneous join
      spouse consideration.
         A8.5.2.1. When an airman is selected as the most eligible nonvolunteer for an OS assignment
         (where an accompanied tour is authorized) or a CONUS to CONUS PCS, and his or her join
         spouse intent code indicates join spouse assignment is desired (codes "A" or "B"), then the spouse
         will automatically be provided an assignment to the same or adjacent location if eligible for PCS
         and a requirement exists. If a join spouse assignment is not possible, narrative remarks in the
         assignment transaction will be included for the member originally selected giving the reasons why
         a join spouse assignment cannot be approved so the airmen can be counseled accordingly. To be
         eligible for selection for an OS assignment as a volunteer with join spouse intent code "A" or "B",
         requirements for both airmen must have been advertised on the EQUAL for the same or adjacent
         locations.
         A8.5.2.2. While the EQUAL is used by join spouse couples volunteering for OS assignments, it is
         not used for OS returnees. Because of the many variables involved, such as unique grade and
         AFSC combinations, return join spouse assignments are hand-matched. It is important airmen
         keep their assignment preferences updated in the event of changes in requirements (but remember
         join spouse intent code ensures join spouse consideration and takes priority over individual pref-
         erences). Requirements advertised on the EQUAL are for non-join spouse returnees and join
         spouse members with intent code "H" only, so couples returning together should not use EQUAL
         but rather update preferences based on their desires.
         A8.5.2.3. If an airman is in the CONUS and the spouse is returning from OS, the initial join
         spouse consideration is to return to the spouse’s CONUS location. If there is no requirement at the
         spouse’s CONUS location and the spouse in the CONUS meets PCS eligibility criteria, then he or
         she will be considered for join spouse assignment to the OS returnee’s projected CONUS location.
         For enlisted militar couples who desire CONUS or OS assignment consideration in conjuction
         with the OS follow-on program, see paragraph A5.10.2.
         A8.5.2.4. When an airman is serving on a CONUS stabilized tour and the spouse is selected for
         reassignment, the following options apply:
             A8.5.2.4.1. If the spouse is selected as the most eligible nonvolunteer for an OS assignment to
             an accompanied tour location, the airman may request release from the stabilized tour for join
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                299


          spouse assignment. If approved, reporting date will depend whether or not a replacement is
          required, reporting date of replacement, etc.
          A8.5.2.4.2. If the spouse is selected as a volunteer for OS, special duty assignment, and so
          forth, the spouse can request to withdraw his or her volunteer statement and, if approved, the
          projected assignment is canceled.
          A8.5.2.4.3. If the spouse is selected as the most eligible nonvolunteer for an OS assignment to
          a dependent-restricted location , then join spouse assignment is not authorized. The spouse
          may request a home-basing assignment or, as an OS returnee, will receive join spouse assign-
          ment consideration to return to the member’s stabilized tour location.
       A8.5.2.5. When members marry while both are technical training students they should apply for
       join spouse assignment as soon as possible to receive consideration for assignment together upon
       graduation. If necessary, both members are retained at the training center pending final join
       spouse decision by the assignment OPR. When one member is a student, he or she may apply to
       join the spouse at the spouse's permanent duty location, or if the non-student spouse is also
       selected or scheduled for PCS, join spouse assignment to the non-student's new duty station may
       be requested.
       A8.5.2.6. When one member of an enlisted military couple will serve an unaccompanied OS
       short tour and upon completion of the OS tour a join spouse assignment is desired to a location
       other than the spouse’s current location, in limited circumstances as outlined in paragraph
       A5.10.2.2. (for CONUS) and A5.10.2.3. (for OS), assignment consideration in conjunction with
       the assignment follow-on program to a location other than the spouse’s current location may be
       requested.

A8.6. How Military Couples Request Join Spouse Assignment Consideration. There are different
ways to request join spouse assignment consideration. Officers follow procedures under AFAS guide-
lines. Completion of the AF Form 1048 provides join spouse assignment consideration for enlisted mem-
bers as provided in paragraph A8.6.2. Some situations require members to submit a letter application
(see Figure A8.1.) in order to receive join spouse assignment consideration.
   A8.6.1. Application Procedures. A letter application is necessary to receive join spouse assignment
   consideration:
       A8.6.1.1. Each time the AF member of an interservice military couple desires join spouse assign-
       ment consideration. When the spouse is notified of assignment and the AF member desires join
       spouse assignment, an application must be submitted. In addition, a statement from the spouse
       indicating concurrence for join spouse assignment must accompany each application, or
       A8.6.1.2. When members marry while assigned to separate locations. Provided both meet PCS
       eligibility criteria, either member may apply. Regardless who applies, military requirements dic-
       tate which member is reassigned, or
       A8.6.1.3. When the marriage occurs after the assignment selection of one or both members.
       Members who marry while en route to assignments at different locations must understand they
       cannot delay join spouse assignment application until arrival at their respective locations. Mem-
       bers who marry en route should report to the nearest AF installation and make application imme-
       diately after marriage. The MPF will contact the assignment OPR by the most expedient means to
       request join spouse assignment consideration. No reimbursement for any travel in conjunction
300                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


         with such application is authorized and status is leave (delay en route) while the application is
         pending. A change in port call and/or RNLTD may be appropriate. When a member arrives in the
         local area of assignment, whether or not "signed in," for assignment purposes the PCS is complete
         and TOS requirements and other PCS eligibility criteria must be met before a subsequent move to
         join spouse, or
         A8.6.1.4. When military spouse information is incorrect in the PDS.
      A8.6.2. The applicant must contact the MPF for help in applying for join spouse assignment. The
      servicing MPF makes sure that:
         A8.6.2.1. Members meet all PCS eligibility criteria and understand all assignment conditions.
         A8.6.2.2. Members are counseled on their entitlements to dependent travel, shipment of house-
         hold goods, and any other information related to the PCS.
         A8.6.2.3. Members do not have a pending application for any self-initiated voluntary assignment
         identified in paragraph A8.3.10.
         A8.6.2.4. A statement from the spouse indicating join spouse assignment is desired accompanies
         the AF member's application in an interservice marriage.
      A8.6.3. In those situations for enlisted couples where the join spouse intent code is properly updated
      but simultaneous assignments did not flow, the MPF will ensure member is fully aware of join spouse
      eligibility requirements, and that, if eligible, spouse should immediately submit a request for join
      spouse assignment.
         A8.6.3.1. The MPF checks eligibility, suspenses a copy of the application, and transmits the
         request through PDS to the assignment OPR using PTI 550 procedures. An information copy of
         the request is sent by PTI 550 to the parent MAJCOM.
             A8.6.3.1.1. Refer to AFCSM 36-699, volume I, chapter 5 for PTI 550 procedures.
         A8.6.3.2. The assignment OPR makes the assignment decision and establishes the RNLTD based
         on manning requirements. Approval will be transmitted to the MPF by PTI 517 and disapproval
         by PTI 52T.

A8.7. Approval Guidelines. Join spouse assignments are usually approved when the eligibility criteria
are met by both AF members and assignment is consistent with the needs of the AF (based primarily on
grade and AFSC). Because of variable qualification factors, officer join spouse assignments can be more
difficult. At times, all face limitations and restrictions which govern each individual case and sometimes
approval may not be possible. Some situations inherently limit join spouse assignment possibilities, such
as when the spouse is in another US military service, is assigned to school for training, special duty
assignment, at a location where the spouse's AFSC is not authorized, on a stabilized tour, etc.
      A8.7.1. If HQ AFPC is unable to assign the military couple together based on their current AFSCs, an
      airman may apply for retraining, if eligible, and an officer, if eligible, may apply for a DAFSC change
      to facilitate join spouse assignment. Approval of this type request depends on AF requirements.
      However, retraining or a DAFSC change request while in technical training, or within 12 months fol-
      lowing graduation, for the sole purpose of join spouse assignment is not authorized. NOTE: Enlisted
      members may request, as an exception, an AFSC change during technical training when join spouse
      assignment opportunities are extremely limited or nonexistent because of incompatible AFSCs
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    301


   between the couple. These requests may be considered based on the relative need in both AFSCs
   when the training capability exists at the current location, training already received is required for the
   requested AFSC, and no interruption in training will occur.
   A8.7.2. In order to provide optimum consideration for join spouse assignment, CONUS assignments
   to adjacent locations may be approved when the locations are close enough to allow establishing a
   joint household (usually no more than 50 miles apart). OS locations have numerous variables
   involved, such as weather and road conditions, cost of living, commute time, and availability of hous-
   ing, etc. Because of these variables, HQ AFPC/DPAPP1, in coordination with the OS MAJCOMs,
   determines which OS locations are within a join spouse cluster. These clusters are considered when
   reviewing military couples for OS join spouse assignments.

A8.8. Miscellaneous Instructions.
   A8.8.1. If the members have dependents, when assignment is to an OS location where an accompa-
   nied tour is authorized, follow the dependent travel request procedures according to AFCSM 36-699,
   Volume 1 and AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel. This is necessary to obtain a housing availability
   determination for the family, for household goods shipment, and so forth. Where there are severe
   housing shortages, the initial request for concurrent travel may be disapproved; however, there are
   categories of exceptions, and one of these is usually military couples with dependents. A delay in
   RNLTD for one member may be requested, but couples must be advised to make arrangements for the
   care of their dependents in the event both must proceed as scheduled. If concurrent travel is autho-
   rized but later becomes impractical (for personal or official reasons), a change of RNLTD may be
   requested from the assignment OPR. Include the specific reasons the change is being requested.
   A8.8.2. Military couples with dependents who have concurrent assignments to separate depen-
   dent-restricted locations must make dependent care arrangements. Refusal or inability to arrange care
   for dependents may result in disciplinary and (or) involuntary separation (see AFI 36-2908, Family
   Care Plans).
   A8.8.3. Military couples selected for reassignment (or assigned) to the same or adjacent (clustered)
   OS location where an accompanied tour is authorized must each serve the accompanied tour length
   (plus 12 months for enlisted couples if either was selected as an extended tour volunteer) regardless of
   the AAR which applied to either assignment. When assignment is to the same or adjacent (clustered)
   location and members will reside jointly, include in the remarks section of the PCS orders "Assign-
   ment is to join spouse" regardless of the assignment action reason (AAR). This will ensure proper
   household goods weight entitlement and tour length when assignment is OS. When marriage occurs
   after both are assigned OS at the same or adjacent (clustered) location, each may retain the original
   tour length or volunteer to serve the accompanied tour.
   A8.8.4. Assignment OPRs make the assignment decision and establish the RNLTD based on man-
   ning requirements. Normally, assignment approvals are transmitted to the MPF by PTI 517 and disap-
   provals by PTI 52T.
   A8.8.5. If assigned OS on a join spouse assignment and you and your spouse do not have the same
   DEROS month, the member with the earlier DEROS must extend if you desire to be reassigned at the
   same time. Failing to match DEROS months reduces the chance for join spouse assignment upon
   completion of your OS tour. Curtailment of the later arriving member's DEROS for the purpose of
   reassignment at the same time is not authorized.

A8.9. Assignment Restrictions. Couples who are assigned PCS to the same or adjacent CONUS loca-
tion, regardless of the AAR, are usually not reassigned for a period of 24 months from the date arrived sta-
tion of the latest arriving member. The MPF places both members in AAC 32 according to Table 2.1.
Any later availability date for other reasons for either member remains in affect. If married while serving
at the same location, the MPF will not update AAC 32.
      A8.9.1. When members are being assigned PCS to separate locations in proximity and will establish
      a joint household, the MPF/DPMAE contacts the MPF/DPMAE at the spouse's location to verify loca-
      tion of assignment and coordinate whether or not update of AAC 32 is appropriate. Couples assigned
      in excess of 50 miles apart will not be placed assigned in AAC 32 unless specifically authorized by
      HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 as an exception.

A8.10. Exceptions. Exceptions (paragraph 1.5.) to the criteria in this attachment are considered only for
unique or unusual circumstances which will result in a hardship not usually encountered by other military
members. Requests must be fully justified and forwarded through appropriate command channels to HQ
AFPC/DPAPP1 unless directed otherwise in this instruction.

                            AIRCREW FAMILY MEMBER ASSIGNMENT

A9.1. Purpose. To provide aircrew members an avenue to apply for a PCA or PCS when another member
of the immediate family is in the same unit.
   A9.1.1. For this program, a member's immediate family is defined as his or her parents, to include
   stepparents, parents by adoption, and those who stood in the place of a parent for at least 5 years
   immediately preceding the initial entry on active duty of the member who died, is missing or captured,
   or 100 percent disabled.
   A9.1.2. Brothers and sisters, to include stepbrothers and stepsisters, brothers or sisters by adoption, or
   half brothers or half sisters in the household at the time the member who died, is missing or captured,
   or 100 percent disabled initially entered active duty.
   A9.1.3. Spouse.
   A9.1.4. Natural child.
   A9.1.5. Legally adopted child.
   A9.1.6. Stepchild, if the child was a member of the household at the time the member or former mem-
   ber died, was missing or captured, or was determined to be 100 percent disabled.
   A9.1.7. An illegitimate child to whose support a male member or former member has been ordered
   judicially to contribute, or of whom he has been decreed judicially to be the father, or of whom he has
   acknowledged in writing under oath that he is the father.
   A9.1.8. A person for whom the member stood in place of a parent for at least 5 years immediately
   preceding the date on which the member or former member died, was missing or captured, or deter-
   mined to be 100 percent disabled.

A9.2. Aircrew Family Member Criteria. Exposure to a common danger represented by serving as an air-
crew member in the same unit is sufficient reason for all but one member of an immediate family to
request reassignment to a different unit or location. Only aircrew members may request reassignment.

A9.3. Application Procedures.
   A9.3.1. Member. Submits application (Figure A9.1.) to unit commander.
   A9.3.2. Unit Commander. Reviews request and verifies eligibility based on the definition in Attach-
   ment 1. When PCS is involved, verifies PCS eligibility by ensuring members do not have quality fac-
   tors, as outlined in paragraph 2.40.
       A9.3.2.1. Recommends approval or disapproval on all requests. When there is a question
       whether to PCA or PCS the member, resolves these situations through the MPF (lowest possible
       level), using PCA when possible.
       A9.3.2.2. Requests recommended for disapproval must provide the specific reasons for the disap-
       proval. When disapproval is recommended the request must be forwarded to the MPF and then to
       the parent MAJCOM for further consideration.

      A9.3.3. MPF. Reviews requests and verifies PCA/PCS eligibility and when the commander recom-
      mends disapproval, forwards the request to the parent MAJCOM for further consideration.
      A9.3.4. MAJCOM.
         A9.3.4.1. Considers intracommand assignments for aircrew PCS requests.
         A9.3.4.2. Forwards aircrew PCS requests which cannot be resolved when the commander has
         recommended disapproval to the assignment OPR.
      A9.3.5. Assignment OPR. Makes a final determination on any request received.

                          PERMISSIVE PCS ASSIGNMENT PROGRAM
                   (LIEUTENANT COLONELS AND BELOW AND ALL AIRMEN)

A10.1. General Information. DoD prescribes only one set of PCS eligibility policies and procedures.
Any program the AF has must exist within the framework of PCS policies and procedures DoD pre-
scribes. This is one reason why, even for permissive PCS, there are minimum TOS and retainability
requirements, members incur a PCS ADSC, and other PCS eligibility requirements apply. The expanded
permissive and CONUS assignment exchange, which apply only for CONUS-to-CONUS moves, are per-
mitted within strict parameters and any TOS or retainability waivers require the same originator and
approval levels as do funded moves. A permissive PCS is one where the member agrees to pay all
expenses involved or associated with the move. However, a member's willingness to PCS at their own
expense is not the sole basis for approving a permissive PCS. If the PCS is approved, all travel time
(including house hunting) used during the move is charged as ordinary leave. A member of a military
couple who desires to participate in either of these programs must have join spouse intent code “H” (join
spouse not desired), and include the statement of understanding required for paragraph 4 of Figure A10.1.
and Figure A10.2.
      A10.1.1. Conditions for Approval of Expanded Permissive PCS. Requests may be approved when
      the assignment OPR determines:
         A10.1.1.1. There are no members in a mandatory PCS status to fill the particular requirement, and
         A10.1.1.2. Manning at the losing base is above the established (normal manned) CONUS man-
         ning level and will remain above normal with the loss of the member (there is no requirement for
         a backfill), and
         A10.1.1.3. Manning at the requested base is below the established (normal manned) CONUS
         manning level and will remain below normal with the gain of the member and not exceed 100 per-
         cent, and
         A10.1.1.4. Officers. The experience level at the current and requested base support the reassign-
         ment and the position is consistent with the officer's professional development.

A10.2. Expanded Permissive Reassignment Eligibility Criteria. To apply, members must be assigned in
the CONUS and:
      A10.2.1. If a career officer or career airman, have at least 2 years, 5 months TOS (or be within 7
      months of expiration of an AAC (other than quality control), and at least 3 years TOS before PCS
      departure.
      A10.2.2. If a noncareer officer or first-term airman, have at least 1 year, 5 months TOS (or be within
      7 months of expiration of an AAC (other than quality control), and at least 2 years TOS before PCS
      departure.
      A10.2.3. Not have an assignment selection date.
      A10.2.4. Not be vulnerable for involuntary OS assignment selection. NOTE: ODSD and STRD
      waivers may be requested at the time of application.
      A10.2.5. Meet all PCS eligibility criteria.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 309


   A10.2.6. Have or be able to obtain the PCS retainability required by Table 2.5.
   A10.2.7. Not be an OS volunteer or have any other voluntary assignment application pending.

A10.3. Expanded Permissive Application Procedures/Limitations.
   A10.3.1. Officers apply for expanded permissive reassignment using AFAS guidelines and Figure
   A10.1.
   A10.3.2. Airmen may list up to 8 CONUS preferences (bases or locales) and apply for expanded per-
   missive reassignment in one of two ways. They may use Figure A10.1. and submit a “hard copy”
   application or use PC-III to initiate an automated expanded permissive application located under
   “In-System Assignment Request.” Using PC-III to apply will automatically flow the application elec-
   tronically to the commander for coordination.
   A10.3.3. If an initial request is disapproved, the member may reapply for different bases at any time.
   A member may not reapply for the original choices earlier than 6 months from the date of disapproval.

A10.4. Commander Actions on Expanded Permissive Requests. Commanders review applications and
either recommend approval or disapprove the request (disapproving the request requires specific justifica-
tion). Returns disapproved requests to the member. For officers, the commander will also be involved in
the LCIP process. For those recommended for approval, hard copy applications are forwarded to the MPF
for further processing. For PC-III applications, commanders must access the Office Automation (OA)
environment under “Incoming Coordination,” mark the appropriate recommendation box, and then elec-
tronically forward the application to the MPF for further processing.

A10.5. MPF Actions on Expanded Permissive Requests.
   A10.5.1. Reviews eligibility of the applicant.
   A10.5.2. Updates hard copy expanded permissive applications via PDS by updating PTI 550. For
   PC-III applications, accesses the OA environment under “Incoming Coordination,” and completes the
   coordination. Ensures requests for waiver (if necessary) are included in the application. Completing
   the coordination in PC-III will automatically generate the PTI 550 and a source document at the mem-
   ber’s CSS. Refer to AFCSM 36-699, chapter 5, for further updating procedures.
   A10.5.3. Upon receipt of assignment instructions for approved requests, ensures special orders reflect
   the PCS cost identifier code of "M," Reassignment Without Fund Allocation. Indicates in the remarks
   section of the special order that the PCS is at no cost to the government, and that travel time and
   house hunting will be charged as ordinary leave.

A10.6. MAJCOM Actions on Expanded Permissive Requests. MAJCOMs may provide input, as
deemed appropriate, to the assignment OPR on any request for permissive reassignment.

A10.7. Assignment OPR Actions on Expanded Permissive Requests.
   A10.7.1. Approves or disapproves expanded permissive PCS requests.
   A10.7.2. Advises members of the final decision via the PDS.
   A10.7.3. Will not change a funded PCS to a permissive PCS, nor a permissive PCS to a funded PCS.
310                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      A10.7.4. Does not authorize a member on a permissive PCS to perform funded TDY en route.

A10.8. Requests to Cancel an Approved Expanded Permissive Reassignment. Once a request for
expanded permissive PCS is approved, member’s are expected to continue with the move even if the
assignment is no longer desired. A request for cancellation or release from the move must be based on
circumstances which occurred after approval and be submitted to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 as an exception
according to paragraph 1.5.

A10.9. Conditions for Approval of CONUS Assignment Exchange PCS. Requests may be approved
when the assignment OPR determines:
      A10.9.1. Both members are similarly qualified.
      A10.9.2. Both the gaining and losing commanders agree to the exchange.

A10.10. CONUS Assignment Exchange Eligibility Criteria. To apply, members must be assigned in the
CONUS and:
      A10.10.1. If a career officer or career airman, have at least 2 years, 5 months TOS (or be within 7
      months of expiration of an AAC (other than quality control), and at least 3 years TOS before PCS
      departure.
      A10.10.2. If a noncareer officer or first-term airman, have at least 1 year, 5 months TOS (or be within
      7 months of expiration of an AAC (other than quality control), and at least 2 years TOS before PCS
      departure.
      A10.10.3. Not have an assignment selection date.
      A10.10.4. Not be vulnerable for involuntary OS assignment selection. NOTE: ODSD and STRD
      waivers may be requested at the time of application.
      A10.10.5. Meet all PCS eligibility criteria.
      A10.10.6. Have or be able to obtain the PCS retainability required by Table 2.5.
      A10.10.7. Not be an OS volunteer or have any other voluntary assignment application pending.
      A10.10.8. The member must "find" another member at a CONUS base who wants to exchange
      assignments and who meets all eligibility criteria. Officers must be the same grade, specialty, and
      similarly qualified. Airmen must be the same grade, specialty, skill level, and both must possess the
      same SEI if an SEI requirement applies to a requested assignment. EXCEPTION: A different 3-level
      suffix for airmen in grade A1C in an AFSC that drops the suffixes at the 5-level is not a disqualifying
      factor for the exchange.

A10.11. CONUS Assignment Exchange Application Procedures/Limitations.
      A10.11.1. Officers apply for CONUS assignment exchange using AFAS guidelines and Figure
      A10.2.
      A10.11.2. Airmen apply for CONUS assignment exchange in one of two ways. They may use Figure
      A10.2. and submit a “hard copy” application or use PC-III to initiate an automated CONUS assign-
      ment exchange application located under “In-System Assignment Request.” Using PC-III to apply
      will automatically flow the application electronically to the commander for coordination.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 311


A10.12. Commander Actions on CONUS Assignment Exchange Requests. Reviews applications and
either recommends approval or disapproves the request (disapproving the request requires specific justifi-
cation). Returns disapproved requests to the member. For officers, the LCIP is considered complete upon
the commander’s recommendation of approval. For those recommended for approval, hard copy applica-
tions are forwarded to the MPF for further processing. For PC-III applications, commanders must access
the Office Automation (OA) environment under “Incoming Coordination,” mark the appropriate recom-
mendation box, and then electronically forward the application to the MPF for further processing.

A10.13. MPF Actions on CONUS Assignment Exchange Requests.
   A10.13.1. Reviews eligibility of the applicant they service.
   A10.13.2. When commanders at the gaining and losing stations agree to the exchange, the MPF ser-
   vicing the member whose (last) name occurs first in alphabetical order is responsible for processing
   the requests to the assignment OPR. Also, sends an information copy to each person's MAJCOM and
   to the servicing MPF of the other person.
   A10.13.3. Updates hard copy CONUS assignment exchange applications via PDS by updating PTI
   550. For PC-III applications, accesses the OA environment under “Incoming Coordination,” and
   completes the coordination. Ensures requests for waiver (if necessary) are included in the application.
   Completing the coordination in PC-III will automatically generate the PTI 550 and a source document
   at the member’s CSS. Refer to AFCSM 36-699, chapter 5, for further updating procedures.
   A10.13.4. Upon receipt of assignment instructions for approved requests, ensures special orders
   reflect the PCS cost identifier code of "M," Reassignment Without Fund Allocation. Indicates in the
   remarks section of the special order that the PCS is at no cost to the government, and that travel time
   and house hunting will be charged as ordinary leave.

A10.14. MAJCOM Actions on CONUS Assignment Exchange Requests. MAJCOMs may provide
input, as deemed appropriate, to the assignment OPR on any request for permissive reassignment.

A10.15. Assignment OPR Actions on CONUS Assignment Exchange Requests.
   A10.15.1. Approves or disapproves requests for CONUS assignment exchange.
   A10.15.2. Advises members of the final decision via the PDS.
   A10.15.3. Disapproves a request based on either member’s OS vulnerability.
   A10.15.4. Will not change a funded PCS to a permissive PCS, nor a permissive PCS to a funded PCS.
   A10.15.5. Does not authorize a member on a permissive PCS to perform funded TDY en route.

A10.16. Request to Cancel an Approved CONUS Assignment Exchange Assign m e n t . O n c e a
request for a CONUS assignment exchange is approved, both members are expected to continue with the
move even if the assignment is no longer desired. A request for cancellation or release from the move by
one or both members must be based on circumstances which occurred after approval and be submitted to
HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 as an exception according to paragraph 1.5.

                                            Attachment 11

           SOLE SURVIVING SON OR DAUGHTER ASSIGNMENT RESTRICTION

A11.1. Purpose. The sole surviving son or daughter assignment restriction restricts an eligible member
from duties involving combat with the enemy and precludes assignment (including both PCS and TDY)
to any OS hostile fire or imminent danger area as designated in the DoD Military Pay and Allowances
Entitlements Manual. This restriction does not preclude the assignment of a sole surviving son or daugh-
ter to an OS area where combat conditions are nonexistent.

A11.2. Eligibility Criteria. Members currently engaged in combat may request reassignment to duties
not involving combat and/or those members who are currently assigned PCS or TDY to a designated hos-
tile fire or imminent danger area may request reassignment, that is, termination of TDY and/or PCS reas-
signment from the designated area. A sole surviving son or daughter is a service member who is the only
surviving son or daughter in a family where the father, or mother, or one or more sons or one or more
daughters, served in the U.S. Armed Forces, and as a direct result of the hazards of duty in the Service,
the father, or mother, or one or more sons or daughters:
   A11.2.1. Was killed, or
   A11.2.2. Died as a result of wounds, accident or disease, or
   A11.2.3. Is in a captured or missing-in-action status, or
   A11.2.4. Is permanently 100 percent physically disabled (including 100 percent mental disability), as
   determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs or one of the Military Services.
   A11.2.5. The requirement that death or disability be a direct result of the hazards of service does not
   require that the family member's death or disability occur in combat or during assignment to a desig-
   nated hostile fire or imminent danger area, but does require that death be determined as in the line of
   duty. (In general, in the line of duty means death or disability did not occur: while the person was in
   desertion status or voluntarily absent without authority for more than 24 hours or voluntarily absent
   from a scheduled duty, a formation, a restriction, or an arrest; by reason or a condition that existed
   before service; or as a result of his or her own misconduct [the term "misconduct" includes both will-
   ful misconduct and gross negligence]).
   A11.2.6. A member who is an only child (only son or only daughter), in itself, does not qualify a
   member for the sole surviving son or daughter assignment restriction.
   A11.2.7. The parent through whom a member seeks to qualify does not need to be living, but the
   member must meet the criteria of sole surviving son or daughter, natural or adopted, of that parent.
   A11.2.8. Requests may not be submitted on behalf of a member by his/her family or other persons.

A11.3. Member's Request. Members who want the assignment restriction and who meet the criteria in
paragraph A11.2. must submit a request as shown in Figure A11.1. and provide the complete information
required.
   A11.3.1. If the documentation required to accompany member's request is not readily available, the
   MPF will assist the member as necessary which may include obtaining official verification and proof
   of casualty status through HQ AFPC/DPWC. For the family member who meets the criteria of para-
316                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      graph A11.2., the request must include that person's name, service number or SSN, date of death or
      capture or date listed as missing-in-action, and branch of the Armed Forces in which served or serv-
      ing. If the family member died after 1 Jan 1961, state his or her home of record so the appropriate
      agency may use it in the verification of death.
      A11.3.2. Members may decide not to request the sole surviving son or daughter assignment restric-
      tion. Also, a member who has received approval of the restriction may request waiver of the restric-
      tion, in writing, through the unit commander to the MPF commander. Requests for waiver will be
      approved upon request by the MPF commander with information to the unit commander. A member
      who enlists, reenlists or extends his or her period of active duty after the date of notification of the
      family casualty which qualified him or her for the restriction, will be considered as having waived the
      protective assignment provisions. A member who has waived the protective provisions (by request,
      or as a result of enlistment, reenlistment or extension) may apply (or reapply) for the restriction, in
      writing, at any time through their commander to the MPF commander.

A11.4. Commander's Action. Commanders will review requests and may consider restricting duties
while the member's request is pending although restriction on an interim basis is not mandatory until noti-
fied of approval. Commanders may disapprove requests when the eligibility criteria in paragraph A11.2.
is clearly not met. Questionable cases should be forwarded to the MPF for further review.

A11.5. MPF Action. When an MPF receives a request from the commander, the MPF will review eligi-
bility and ensure all required information is included and as expeditiously as possible forward to the MPF
commander for approval or disapproval. The MPF commander may disapprove requests when the eligi-
bility criteria in paragraphs A11.2. is not met. Questionable cases should be forwarded to HQ AFPC/
DPAPP for resolution. Upon approval, the MPF notifies the member's commander and directs immediate
placement of the member in ALC J. If the member's present status (TDY or PCS) is in conflict with the
assignment restriction, then the member's commander will take appropriate action. If PCS is required, the
MPF will advise the appropriate assignment OPR, with information to the member’s parent MAJCOM,
and request immediate assignment instructions. If PCS is disapproved for some reason, the assignment
OPR will advise the parent MAJCOM, MPF commander and unit commander and include the reason(s)
for disapproval. The MPF will return any original documents for member's retention.

A11.6. Assignment OPR Action. When advised by the MPF that an MPF commander has approved a
member's request and PCS is necessary to comply with the assignment restriction, assignment OPRs will
obtain waivers of PCS eligibility if necessary and immediately provide PCS instructions consistent with
the needs of the AF and the sole surviving son or daughter assignment restrictions.

A11.7. MPF Action Upon Approval. Upon approval by the MPF commander, the MPF will update
ALC J which will automatically update DAC 61. The MPF will notify the member, in writing, and have
the member acknowledge approval, in writing. The notification of approval must advise the member of
both waiver provisions (the automatic waiver provision and the member's waiver provision after
approval) and of the reinstatement provisions. File a copy of the approval correspondence and member's
written acknowledgment in the UPRG. After approval, should a member later request, in writing, to
waive the sole surviving son or daughter assignment restriction, the MPF commander may approve the
waiver and will advise the member's unit commander. Attach a copy of the waiver approval to the origi-
nal restriction approval correspondence and file in the member's UPRG. The MPF will advise the mem-
ber's unit commander of the approved waiver and remove ALC J and DAC 61. Should the member later
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                     317


request reinstatement, he/she must repeat the original request process and indicate that the request is for
reinstatement. If PCS reassignment is directed, the MPF will process the member for PCS as required.

A11.8. Following are some examples of situations which do meet the criteria to qualify as a sole surviv-
ing son or daughter:
   A11.8.1. The only son and only daughter of a mother or father who meets the criteria in paragraph
   A11.2., both qualify as a sole surviving son and a sole surviving daughter.
   A11.8.2. There are 3 children in a family; two boys and a girl. One of the boys meets the criteria in
   paragraph A11.2., therefore, the two remaining children (one boy and one girl) both qualify as a sole
   surviving son and a sole surviving daughter.
   A11.8.3. An active duty member is an only child and one parent is also on active duty. While on
   approved leave, the active duty parent is killed while a passenger in the crash of a U.S. civilian com-
   mercial passenger aircraft. The parent's death is determined by the Air Force to be in the line of duty
   (see paragraph A11.2.5.). Since the criteria in paragraph A11.2. is met, the child qualifies as a sole
   surviving son/daughter. The finding that death was in the line of duty meets the requirement that
   death was as a direct result of the hazards of service.

A11.9. Following are some examples of situations which do not meet the criteria of sole surviving son or
daughter:
   A11.9.1. A family has one child (boy or girl). The child is on active duty in the AF. The fact that a
   child is an only child does not, in itself, qualify the child for the sole surviving son or daughter assign-
   ment restriction.
   A11.9.2. A family has one child (boy or girl). The child is on active duty in the AF. The father (or
   mother) dies of natural causes. The child is not a sole surviving son or daughter since the criteria in
   paragraph A11.2. is not met.
   A11.9.3. There are 3 children in a family, two sons and a daughter. One son and the daughter are
   members of the AF. The son who is not in the AF is killed in a car accident. Neither the remaining
   son nor the remaining daughter qualify as a sole surviving son or daughter since the criteria in para-
   graph A11.2. is not met.

                           THREATENED PERSON ASSIGNMENTS (TPA)

A12.1. General Information. This assignment program rapidly removes the military member and
his or her dependents from a life threatening situation. Threats of bodily harm or death must have
been made against the military member or his or her dependents and be of such severity that military and
civilian authorities are unable to provide for the family's continued safety. The threats and circumstances
must be verified as indicated below.
      A12.1.1. Because assignments to OS locations require significantly longer processing time (medical
      clearance, concurrent travel, passport/visa, etc.) only CONUS locations are used for this program.

A12.2. Processing Guidelines. The TPA program is not a MPF, unit commander, or member-initiated
assignment request. The decision to request a TPA rests with the installation commander. The installa-
tion commander:
      A12.2.1. Convenes a meeting with the MSSQ/CC or MPF Commander, the Security Forces Com-
      mander, AFOSI representative, the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA), and the member's immediate com-
      mander to assess the case and determine appropriate action.
      A12.2.2. Decides whether to move the individual immediately to ensure his or hersafety by sending
      the person TDY until they resolve the threat, or until receipt of assignment instructions. Do not use
      permissive TDY with this program.
      A12.2.3. Does not request PCS until all other means of providing safety are exhausted. As a basic
      condition for approval the threat must be verified by the AFOSI.
      A12.2.4. Decides if reassignment is necessary and provides full facts and circumstances to HQ
      AFPC/DPAPP1 through AFOSI secured message channels for assignment determination. Do not use
      normal message traffic to request a TPA.
      A12.2.5. Request must include:
         A12.2.5.1. Name, grade, SSN, and AFSC.
         A12.2.5.2. Unit of assignment.
         A12.2.5.3. Assignment waivers required, if appropriate.
         A12.2.5.4. Assignment action pending, if appropriate.
         A12.2.5.5. Detailed explanation of circumstances warranting assignment. If confirmed threats
         are being made by an ex-spouse and there are children from the marriage, include custody and vis-
         itation decision by the court which granted the divorce. If the Air Force member has custody of a
         child and an ex-spouse (parent) has court-directed visitation rights, the Air Force cannot withhold
         the child's location from the ex-spouse.
         A12.2.5.6. Details regarding jurisdiction over the offense, if appropriate.
         A12.2.5.7. Recommendation of the local SJA, who determines whether local (host country
         authorities and the American Embassy for members stationed OS) or other US Military authorities
         object to the member's reassignment.

   A12.4.1. The MPF Commander, or his or her designated trusted agent, must not reveal knowledge of
   the TPA to anyone not having an absolute need-to-know. Provide the maximum assistance possible to
   the member during out-processing and advise the threatened member to report directly to the gaining
   MPF Commander immediately upon arrival at the new duty station. Exercise care when forwarding
   personnel documents between MPFs (OPRs, EPRs, UIFs, etc.).
   A12.4.2. Do not take any PDS loss action. If the threatened member does not report by RNLTD, the
   gaining MPF Commander or trusted agent will notify the losing MPF Commander or trusted agent
   who initiates no-show action. Publish orders according to instructions in AFI 37-128, Administrative
   Orders and AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation Procedures, as some items are intentionally left
   blank.
   A12.4.3. For personnel being assigned to a GSU, mail the Field Personnel Record Group (FPRG) to
   the gaining MPF/MSP, marked "for MPF Commander eyes only."

A12.5. Gaining MPF Actions. Process TPAs according to the following instructions:
   A12.5.1. The MPF Commander, or his or her designated trusted agent, must not reveal knowledge of
   the TPA to anyone not having an absolute need-to-know. Provide the maximum assistance possible to
   the member during in-processing. Exercise care when requesting personnel documents between
   MPFs (OPRs, EPRs, UIFs, etc.).
   A12.5.2. Must take unprojected force gain action (PTI 204) according to AFCSM 36-699 since
   approved TPAs are not updated/projected in the PDS.
   A12.5.3. The MPF Commander or trusted agent deletes the threatened person from the base
   locator, if so desired, for a maximum of 3 years. The threatened person may request to extend
   this exemption from HQ AFPC/DPAPP1.

A12.6. Unit Commander Actions. The losing commander notifies the gaining commander, in writing,
of the full facts and circumstances surrounding the assignment, and any job-related or personal behavior
problems the member may have.

            VOLUNTARY STABILIZED BASE ASSIGNMENT PROGRAM (VSBAP)
                               (AIRMEN ONLY)

A14.1. Purpose. This program provides airmen a stabilized tour in exchange for volunteering for an
assignment to a historically hard to fill location. The current locations used for VSBAP are Cannon AFB,
NM, Grand Forks AFB ND, Minot AFB ND, and Los Angeles AFB CA (including Fort MacArthur CA).
Upon approval, airmen assigned to Grand Forks or Minot AFB will serve a 5-year stabilized tour while
those assigned to Cannon AFB and Los Angeles AFB (or Fort MacArthur) will serve a 4-year stabilized
tour.

A14.2. Who is Eligible. Airmen must:
   A14.2.1. Have at least 2 years, 5 months TOS to apply and at least 3 years TOS before PCS departure
   if assigned in the CONUS (see paragraph A14.3.3. if currently serving on a CONUS stabilized tour).
   A14.2.2. Not have an assignment selection date.
   A14.2.3. Not be in AAC 05, 08, 09, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25, or 27 as listed in Table 2.1. Not
   be in ALC “L” or “8” as listed in Table 2.2.
   A14.2.4. Not have any quality control factors as listed in paragraph 2.40.
   A14.2.5. Not be an OS volunteer or have any other voluntary assignment application pending.

A14.3. Application Procedures/Limitations.
   A14.3.1. Airmen apply for VSBAP in one of two ways. They may use Figure A14.1. and submit a
   “hard copy” application or use PC-III to initiate an automated VECAP application located under
   “In-System Assignment Request.” Using PC-III to update preference(s) will automatically flow the
   application electronically to the commander for coordination.
   A14.3.2. Airmen assigned OS may apply for VSBAP at the time of DEROS forecast.
   A14.3.3. Airmen serving on a CONUS stabilized tour may apply no earlier than 7 months before
   Date of Availability (DOA). The DOA is the expiration date of the AAC associated with the stabi-
   lized tour. If the VSBAP application is approved, departure date will be after the stabilized tour DOA.
   A14.3.4. Airmen assigned to a VSBAP location (but not serving on a VSBAP) may apply for a 5-year
   in-place VSBAP. There is no TOS minimum to apply. The deferment is effective upon approval of
   the application.
   A14.3.5. Airmen assigned to a VSBAP location (and serving a VSBAP) may not receive a consecu-
   tive VSBAP at the same location. They may apply for another VSBAP assignment to a different loca-
   tion after completing 4 years 5 months of the current VSBAP assignment.
   A14.3.6. Career airmen serving on a VSBAP may apply for an in-place BOP 7 months before the end
   of their VSBAP provided they meet all eligibility criteria as outlined in Attachment 2. The DOA for
   an in-place BOP will be 2 years from the completion date of the VSBAP or from the date of approval
   (whichever is later).
       A14.3.6.1. A second VSBAP following an in-place BOP is not authorized.
324                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


A14.4. Commander Actions. Reviews applications and recommends approval/disapproval. Hard copy
applications are forwarded to the MPF for further processing. For PC-III applications, commanders must
access the Office Automation (OA) environment under “Incoming Coordination,” mark the appropriate
recommendation box, and then electronically forward the application to the MPF for further processing.

A14.5. MPF Actions.
      A14.5.1. Reviews eligibility of applicant.
      A14.5.2. Updates hard copy applications via PDS by updating PTI 550. For PC-III applications,
      accesses the OA environment “Incoming Coordination,” and completes the coordination. Completing
      the coordination will automatically generate the PTI 550 and a source document at the member’s CSS.
      Refer to AFCSM 36-699, chapter 5, for further updating procedures.
      A14.5.3. Ensures airmen obtain at least 24 months retainability within 30 days of receipt of approved
      applications.
      A14.5.4. Advises first term airmen who have their VSBAP application approved that they are ineligi-
      ble to later apply for a first-term base of preference assignment. EXCEPTION: This limitation does
      not apply to first-term airmen retraining under CAREERS who will attend a formal training course of
      over 20 weeks duration, or those who cannot be used at their present base in the CAREERS retraining
      AFSC.

A14.6. Canceling/Curtailing an Approved VSBAP. An airman may request cancellation of an
approved VSBAP assignment or curtailment of the 5-year tour after completing 3 years on the VSBAP
assignment. Requests for cancellation must be fully justified, endorsed by the commander, and forwarded
through the MPF to the MAJCOM/DPAA. The MAJCOM is the final approval/disapproval authority.

A14.7. MAJCOM Actions.
      A14.7.1. Reviews and provides a recommendation to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 when an airman on an
      approved VSBAP changes CAFSCs for any reason (other than promotion). VSBAP approval levels
      will be reviewed to preclude exceeding levels in the new CAFSC.
      A14.7.2. Provides recommendations for approval on all in-place VSBAP requests, or disapproves the
      request if disapproval is in the best interest of the AF. NOTE: MAJCOMs may delegate (in writing)
      disapproval authority to wing or senior tenant commanders.
      A14.7.3. Approves or disapproves an airman’s voluntary request for cancellation of an approved
      VSBAP assignment or curtailment of the 5-year tour after the airman completes 3 years on the
      VSBAP assignment. Advises the HQ AFPC assignment OPR to remove the AAC 41 on approved
      requests for curtailment.

A14.8. Assignment OPR Actions.
      A14.8.1. Approves or disapproves applications based on manning. (Limits Los Angeles AFB to 50
      percent of authorizations in each AFSC.)
      A14.8.2. Considers the applicant’s OS tour history and vulnerability.
      A14.8.3. Ensures airmen have or are eligible to obtain 24 months retainability.

  A14.8.4. Continues to consider those applications which cannot be immediately approved for 6
  months or until request is withdrawn by member or applicant becomes ineligible through such action
  as selection for a PCS other than the VSBAP.
  A14.8.5. Considers exceptions for an assignment in an awarded AFSC (other then CAFSC) only
  when world wide and local manning supports.
  A14.8.6. Updates PTI 517 for approvals when PCS in involved and PTI 455 for in-place VSBAP.
  A14.8.7. Updates AAC 41 with appropriate 4 or 5 year DOA from DAS when PCS in involved or 4
  or 5 year DOA from date of approval for in-place VSBAP.
  A14.8.8. Updates PTI 52T for disapproved requests.
  A14.8.9. Removes AAC 41 when notified of a MAJCOM approved curtailment.

              OVERSEAS TOUR EXTENSION INCENTIVE PROGRAM (OTEIP)
                               (AIRMEN ONLY)

A15.1. Purpose. To save PCS funds by providing specific incentives, as authorized by Congress and the
SAF, to airmen in certain skills who extend their OS tour for 12 months.

A15.2. Who is Eligible for OTEIP. To be eligible for OTEIP airmen:
   A15.2.1. Must be serving in either a CAFSC designated by the SAF (first three positions of DAFSC
   must match the first three positions of the CAFSC) or be serving at a short tour location (tour lengths
   of NA/12, 24/12, 24/15) where all AFSCs are eligible, and
   A15.2.2. Must extend their OS tour for a period of 12 months (no more, no less), and
   A15.2.3. Must have or be eligible to obtain the required PCS retainability.

A15.3. Who is Not Eligible for OTEIP.
   A15.3.1. Officers.
   A15.3.2. Airmen who cannot obtain the required retainability.
   A15.3.3. Airmen at long tour locations who do not hold a specific AFSC designated by the SAF.
   A15.3.4. Airmen who extend their DEROS for a period other than 12 months.
   A15.3.5. Airmen whose DEROS is involuntarily extended (during the involuntary extension period
   only).
   A15.3.6. Airmen who have an indefinite DEROS (airmen with an indefinite DEROS must first estab-
   lish a DEROS 12 months from the current date and then, if otherwise eligible, request an OTEIP
   extension).
   A15.3.7. Airmen who are required to serve or agree to serve a prescribed tour length or period of time
   in conjunction with an action or program other than OTEIP are not eligible to receive the OTEIP tour
   extension incentive for the same period. For example, an airman serving a 24 month unaccompanied
   tour who marries and receives approval of command sponsorship or receives a join spouse assignment
   is obligated to serve the accompanied tour length. The member would not be eligible for OTEIP for
   the period of time necessary to support the accompanied tour length.

A15.4. OTEIP Incentives/Restrictions. Eligible airmen may elect one of the following incentive
options:
   A15.4.1. Y1 option: special pay of $2,000 lump sum.
   A15.4.2. Y2 option: 30 days nonchargeable leave.
   A15.4.3. Y3 option: 15 days nonchargeable leave and government funded round trip transportation
   from the OS location to the nearest CONUS port (travel provided for the military member only).
328                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      A15.4.4. Airmen electing the $2,000 lump sum incentive receive it once they enter the 12 month
      OTEIP extension. If an airman is curtailed before completing the entire extension period, recoupment
      of the unearned portion of the incentive pay may be required as explained in paragraph A15.6.
      A15.4.5. Airmen electing either leave option (Y2 or Y3) must take the OTEIP leave incentive within
      6 months after entering the OTEIP extension according to AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program.
      The CSS must comply with AFI 36-3003 to process OTEIP leave and transportation incentives.
      A15.4.6. Once an OTEIP incentive has been approved, any request to change to a different incentive
      requires full justification, to include commander’s recommendation. Submit this type of request by
      message to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 with an information copy to the assignment OPR and parent MAJ-
      COM.

A15.5. Application Procedures.
      A15.5.1. Airmen who are OTEIP eligible apply for OTEIP at the time of DEROS forecasting by
      using the DEROSO RIP. This RIP will automatically reflect the OTEIP incentive options. NOTE:
      CSS’s should not request DEROSO RIPs for OTEIP eligible personnel out-of-cycle (manually).
      Manually requested DEROSO RIPs do not pass the same PDS edits and will not reflect the OTEIP
      options.
         A15.5.1.1. The DEROSO RIP must be signed by the member and commander, and then for-
         warded to the MPF within 30 days from the day it was produced. The MPF must update and pro-
         cess OTEIP requests. CSS’ do not have the capability of updating OTEIP requests (Y1, Y2, Y3)
         through PC-III, they only have the capability of updating normal extensions with DEROS reason
         “EV”. Therefore, CSS’ should never update extensions for OTEIP eligible personnel.
      A15.5.2. Commanders, MAJCOMs, and the assignment OPR evaluate each extension request and
      have disapproval authority when such action is warranted (quality control, projected authorization
      changes, projected over manning by grade and skill, etc.).

A15.6. Cancellation/Recoupment of OTEIP Incentives.
      A15.6.1. Temporary/Permanent Withdrawal of AFSC. When airmen are removed from their incen-
      tive extension CAFSC/DAFSC for cause or for other conditions over which they had control (as deter-
      mined by the commander) and used their incentive, the following apply:
         A15.6.1.1. Recoupment of the unearned part of the incentive pay will be taken based on a
         monthly amount of $166.66, but the DEROS will remain firm unless adjusted by the MAJCOM or
         HQ AFPC. For example, an airman serving an OTEIP extension until November 1998 has his
         AFSC withdrawn for cause in May 1998. In this case, the DEROS will remain November 1998
         and the airmen will have $999.96 recouped from his monthly pay ($166.66 for each month (Jun -
         Nov) he does not serve in the OTEIP AFSC). The MPF must immediately notify HQ AFPC/
         DPAPP1 by message (with an information copy to both the assignment OPR and MAJCOM), of
         the OTEIP AFSC withdrawal action, so recoupment action can be initiated through DFAS-DE.
         A15.6.1.2. Nonchargeable leave and/or transportation incentives used will be charged to the air-
         man. DEROS will remain firm unless adjusted by the MAJCOM or HQ AFPC.
         A15.6.1.3. Airmen removed from their incentive extension CAFSC/DAFSC for reasons other
         than for cause or conditions over which they had no control (as determined by the commander),
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                329


     will usually not be charged for used leave and transportation costs. Those who elected the mone-
     tary incentive will have the unearned portion recouped as explained in paragraph A15.6.1.1. In all
     cases, the DEROS will remain firm unless adjusted by MAJCOM or HQ AFPC. NOTE: All air-
     men are expected to perform duty in the incentive extension AFSC for the complete period of the
     extension. Any temporary duty outside the CAFSC as directed by the commander must first be
     approved by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1.
     A15.6.1.4. Incentive benefits will not be withdrawn for those airmen promoted to a grade that
     results in a mandatory skill level change which may remove him or her from the OTEIP AFSC eli-
     gibility list.
  A15.6.2. Mandatory PCS.
     A15.6.2.1. When an airman has entered the 12 month OTEIP extension and now must be cur-
     tailed due to mission requirements or humanitarian reasons (mandatory PCS), any incentives
     already received/used will normally not be recouped; however, all unused incentives will termi-
     nate upon departure from the current station. HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 is the final approval authority
     for determining if the airman will have to repay the government for any unearned incentives.
     A15.6.2.2. When an airman with an approved OTEIP extension has not entered their extension
     and due to force structure changes, or other mission reasons, the OTEIP extension can no longer
     be supported, the extension will revert to a normal extension. The airman may then request to
     reinstate his or her original DEROS or establish an earlier DEROS which includes the reverted
     normal extension.
     A15.6.2.3. Once a force structure change is announced mission changes may preclude an air-
     man’s use of OTEIP transportation and leave options. When this occurs, airmen may request, with
     commander's concurrence, to change their OTEIP incentive to Y1. Such requests will be submit-
     ted by the airman to the MPF, through the parent MAJCOM, to the assignment OPR.
         A15.6.2.3.1. If an announced closure/inactivation date is subsequently delayed, airmen who
         were OTEIP eligible but were unable to extend the full 12 months (based on the initially
         announced closure/inactivation date) who will now be able to complete a 12 month extension,
         may request OTEIP option Y1 as an exception to policy. This exception request may be pro-
         cessed even though the airman may have already served a portion of the extension that makes
         up the 12 month period. Airmen in this situation are not authorized to apply for options Y2 or
         Y3. These exception requests must be submitted through the MPF to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 for
         a final decision. Requests must include specific start and stop dates which clearly show that
         the airman will complete the required 12 month extension period.
  A15.6.3. Command Sponsorship. Command Sponsorship. Airmen applying for command sponsor-
  ship if obligated to serve additional time to meet requirements of command sponsorship, the member
  is not entitled to OTEIP for the additional extension period. If no additional time is required to com-
  ply with current tour, the member may apply for OTEIP. If the member has an approved OTEIP, but
  has not entered the extension and needs additional time for command sponsorship, the OTEIP exten-
  sion will be canceled or delayed to coincide with the completion of command sponsorship extension.
  If the member has entered the OTEIP extension, the special pay may be prorated and cost of leave/
  travel entitlements may be charged as outlined in paragraphs A15.6.1.1. and A15.6.1.2.

A15.7. Cancellation Requests. Airmen with approved OTEIP extensions may apply for cancellation of
all or part of the extension prior to entering the extension when unique situations apply. If approved, all
OTEIP entitlements are lost upon approval of the cancellation request, whether the extension was can-
celed in full or in part. Requests for cancellation of OTEIP extensions after entry are normally disap-
proved unless extreme circumstances warrant the curtailment. These circumstances include humanitarian
or EFMP conditions (see Attachment 7), or mission changes that prevent completion of the extension.
Requests for cancellation after entry must be processed and approved by HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 and indicate
what incentive benefits have been used or received by the airman. If a cancellation request is approved,
recoupment of the unearned portion of the $2,000 lump sum or leave/transportation incentive will be
completed as outlined in paragraphs A15.6.1.1. and A15.6.1.2.

                 ENLISTED QUARTERLY ASSIGNMENTS LISTING (EQUAL)
                                AND EQUAL-PLUS

A16.1. What is the EQUAL? The EQUAL lists those enlisted requirements (assignments) HQ AFPC
intends to make to and from OS (through SMSgt). It shows what is available by AFSC, grade, and loca-
tion, and allows airmen the opportunity to align preferences to actual AF needs. Airmen can review the
EQUAL at the MPF, CSS, or on the HQ AFPC World Wide Web page: (http://www.HQ AFPC.af.mil).

A16.2. What EQUAL is not. The EQUAL is not used to advertise special duty, joint/departmental,
short notice OS, CONUS to CONUS moves or CMSgt requirements (see EQUAL-Plus in paragraph
A16.8.). Also, the EQUAL is not used to advertise requirements for military couples returning from OS
who desire join spouse assignment (see paragraph A16.7.).

A16.3. How the EQUAL Works. Assignments to and from OS are worked in three month cycles as
shown in paragraphs A16.5. and A16.6. below. Using the selection criteria and priority provided in this
instruction, assignments are matched eight times a year, four cycles each going to and returning from OS.
The CONUS to OS cycle is the first step in the assignment process. Generally, OS requirements (the
number of positions to be filled) are determined based on the number of airmen currently OS who have a
DEROS falling within a given cycle who will be returning to the CONUS. Working with the OS MAJ-
COMs, HQ AFPC uses this information to identify and advertise OS requirements on the EQUAL, allow
airmen to volunteer for, and finally, select airmen for OS assignments. Once the OS assignments have
been matched to airmen, HQ AFPC then works with the CONUS MAJCOMs to identify those CONUS
locations where manning requirements exist. There is one CONUS requirement identified for each OS
returnee. These requirements are then advertised on the returnee EQUAL, OS returnees prioritize the
appropriate advertised requirements, and, finally, the requirements are matched to the returning airmen
according to the selection priority listed in Table 3.14.

A16.4. How to Use the EQUAL.
   A16.4.1. Review the OS EQUAL to see what OS assignments will be made. Using that information,
   you can volunteer for up to eight preferences, using either individual base codes or country codes
   from the advertised requirements. However, listing a specific base limits your selection as a volunteer
   to just that base. For example, if the EQUAL lists a requirement in your AFSC and grade at both
   Ramstein AB and Spangdahlem AB, you can volunteer for both by listing each separately or by just
   listing Germany as an OS preference. However, if you list only Ramstein AB as a preference and not
   Germany, we will not consider you for voluntary assignment to Spangdahlem AB. If more than one
   advertised EQUAL requirement is listed, all preferences are considered equally for assignment pur-
   poses. Provided airmen are eligible for selection, selections are made according to the selection prior-
   ities listed in Table 3.3. and Table 3.4.
   A16.4.2. OS returnees should use the OS Returnee EQUAL to align their CONUS assignment prefer-
   ences to those locations listed (military couples see paragraph A16.7. below). It's understood that the
   requirements advertised may not be true "personal assignment preferences," but since EQUAL
   reflects those assignments which will be made, ignoring, or failing to prioritize the advertised require-
   ments means you will receive the remaining assignment after all those who aligned and provided

      preferences from the EQUAL are matched (regardless of your return priority). You should list your
      personal preferences only after you prioritize the advertised requirements.

A16.7. Military Couples, Join Spouse, and EQUAL.
   A16.7.1. Military couples who desire to be assigned together OS (join spouse intent codes "A" or
   "B") where an accompanied tour is authorized should use the OS EQUAL to volunteer for OS assign-
   ments. If requirements exist for both and one is the most eligible volunteer, both will be selected for
   assignment. However, military couples (with intent codes "A" or "B") who are OS returnees do not
   use the OS Returnee EQUAL as CONUS requirements for returning military couples are not adver-
   tised. Because of the unique grade and AFSC make up of military couples, returnee assignments are
   hand-matched. Returning join spouse couples with intent codes “A” or “B” should maintain matching
   and current CONUS preferences which will be considered during the assignment match. NOTE:
   These procedures do not apply to military couples with intent code “H” (join spouse not desired).
   Members with join spouse intent code “H” do participate in the “normal” OS returnee EQUAL cycle.

A16.8. EQUAL-Plus. The EQUAL-Plus supplements the EQUAL and is used to advertise requirements
for special duty assignments (SDA), Joint/Departmental assignments, short notice OS assignments, and
all CMSgt assignments. The listing is updated weekly and is available through the MPF, the CSS, or on
the HQ AFPC World Wide Web page. EQUAL-Plus shows upcoming requirements, any special qualifi-
cations an airman needs to be eligible for selection, the available locations, reporting instructions, and
POCs you can contact for additional information. Airmen desiring to volunteer for a particular ad may
update their application via PC-III at either the CSS or MPF, or through the worldwide web. The applica-
tion must contain the specific job number reflected in the EQUAL-Plus ad. In addition, some SDAs also
require a hard copy application. CMSgts apply for advertised requirements by contacting their assign-
ment NCO or the POC listed on the advertisement.
334                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


A16.9. Special Duty Assignments (SDAs).
      A16.9.1. General Information. There are certain requirements throughout the AF which cannot be
      satisfied by normal allocation and assignment selection criteria because the duties require airmen with
      unique qualifications. The requirement for unique qualifications, especially when combined with
      other non-standard considerations, may warrant implementation of any of a variety of special man-
      ning procedures different from those used to satisfy the majority of AF requirements. Designation as
      an SDA, in itself, does NOT:
         A16.9.1.1. Increase the manning priority of an activity (that is, its entitlement to personnel
         resources), or
         A16.9.1.2. Authorize a stabilized tour, or
         A16.9.1.3. Affect the responsibility of the assignment OPR to distribute and manage personnel
         resources to best serve the overall needs of the AF. While it is true activities designated as SDAs
         may have some similarities in manning procedures, each special manning procedure is individu-
         ally justified and approved as essential. Designation as an SDA does not result in automatic
         implementation of a standard set of special manning procedures.
         A16.9.1.4. As with any PCS, an airman's qualifications to perform the required duty is the pri-
         mary consideration. Most SDA requirements are filled by eligible volunteers and volunteers are
         preferred by most SDAs. There are few duties for which being a volunteer is a mandatory prereq-
         uisite by law or other directive. While volunteer status is an important factor, it is not a substitute
         for meeting PCS eligibility criteria (except when a volunteer is required by law or other directive).
         Assignment of qualified nonvolunteers is sometimes necessary to avoid unfilled requirements in
         an SDA.
      A16.9.2. Some MAJCOMs and organizations are authorized to initiate assignment requests on air-
      men who have applied for SDAs; such requests require HQ AFPC assignment OPR approval of PCS.
      For other activities, the HQ AFPC assignment OPR both identifies and selects airmen for PCS to the
      SDA.
         A16.9.2.1. Management of stabilized tours is prescribed by paragraph 2.15. and the stabilized
         tour guide.
         A16.9.2.2. Activities authorized to requisition replacement personnel (that is, those not automati-
         cally filled by either computer allocation or the assignment OPR), use either the procedures below,
         EQUAL-Plus, and (or) those procedures agreed to when designated as a SDA. Department and
         joint activities use AF Fm 675, Airman Requisition for Departmental-Joint Activities. Requisi-
         tions must show the identification data of the incumbent and the reason for requisition, such as
         increase in authorization, incumbent selected for reassignment, etc.
             A16.9.2.2.1. For minimum tour activities authorized SDA manning, requisitions are submit-
             ted only when the incumbent is a known loss such as when selected for PCS, approved retire-
             ment, etc.
             A16.9.2.2.2. For maximum tour activities, requisitions are submitted with the forecast of the
             incumbent. Requisitions for replacement personnel for CONUS activities or those OS are sub-
             mitted to arrive not later than the 25th day of the 12th month before the required reporting
             month (if qualification in a foreign language is necessary for the assignment, the length of the
             specific language course should be added to this submission requirement).
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                335


     A16.9.2.3. Whenever an airman is relieved from an SDA for cause, paragraph 2.15. applies to the
     curtailment of the stabilized tour, and paragraph 2.40. applies.
     A16.9.2.4. When activities do not have enough qualified eligible applicants and are entitled to
     additional personnel, they may request manning assistance from the assignment OPR.
     A16.9.2.5. A SDA may require longer service retainability than that required for a non-SDA PCS.
     Airmen who decline to obtain the required service retainability for the SDA will be processed
     according to paragraph 2.29. Having declined, airmen remain eligible for any PCS for which they
     possess sufficient retainability, and may still be assigned to the SDA if the longer service retain-
     ability requirement is appropriately waived.
  A16.9.3. Applying for a SDA. Waivers to the following general criteria to permit an airman to vol-
  unteer for a SDA are not considered. If it becomes necessary to consider personnel for assignment
  who do not meet the general minimum criteria, HQ AFPC (or the special duty activity when autho-
  rized by HQ AFPC), will stipulate the criterion which does not have to be met and solicit volunteers
  or identify nonvolunteers for possible assignment or actual PCS. An airman who does not meet the
  normal minimum general criteria to volunteer for SDA consideration, but does meet the modified cri-
  teria outlined in a solicitation message or EQUAL-Plus ad may volunteer for an SDA at that time, or
  could be selected as a nonvolunteer when necessary.
     A16.9.3.1. Airmen are not eligible to be selected for an SDA if they:
         A16.9.3.1.1. Have any other self-initiated PCS request pending (VECAP, VSBAP, etc.). (Air-
         men may volunteer for normal OS assignment on their AF Form 392 and volunteer for a SDA
         at the same time).
         A16.9.3.1.2. Have an active UIF, are on the Control Roster, or do not meet criteria in para-
         graph 2.40.
         A16.9.3.1.3. Are not recommended by their commander. The commander's favorable recom-
         mendation indicates the airman's past performance and other factors clearly show he or she
         can be expected to perform the duties of the SDA.
         A16.9.3.1.4. Are requesting consideration for a MAJCOM or organization-controlled SDA,
         and do not have an overall rating of at least 3 on their last five EPRs. There must be no unfa-
         vorable comments regarding the airman's personal qualities or conduct, working relations, job
         knowledge, personal appearance, or duty performance within the EP3s.
         A16.9.3.1.5. Are requesting consideration for an HQ AFPC controlled SDA and do not have
         an overall rating of 3 on their last three EPRs. There must be no unfavorable comments
         regarding the airman's personal qualities or conduct, working relations, job knowledge, per-
         sonal appearance, or duty performance within the EPRs.
         A16.9.3.1.6. Are pipeline trainees (except the Security Police Academy for duty with the
         USAF Honor Guard, or when HQ AFPC solicits trainee volunteers). Course supervisor rec-
         ommendation is an acceptable substitute for EPRs for pipeline trainees, but not retrainees.
     A16.9.3.2. The following additional prerequisites also apply:
         A16.9.3.2.1. If airmen are being reported in an AAC listed in Table 2.1., then the DOA for
         reassignment cannot be more than 12 months from the date of application.
336                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


             A16.9.3.2.2. Airmen must possess a skill level commensurate with their grade.
             A16.9.3.2.3. Airmen who possess a CONUS/OS imbalanced AFSC will be considered for an
             OS SDA in only the imbalanced AFSC.
             A16.9.3.2.4. Airmen applying for duty in a Special Duty Identifier (SDI) must be qualified for
             entry or award of the SDI according to AFMAN 36-2108, or the prescribing directive for the
             SDI.
         A16.9.3.3. There is no minimum TOS required to apply for consideration for an SDA. However,
         selection for SDA is dependent on meeting required assignment eligibility criteria as specified in
         Chapter 2. When volunteering for a SDA, airmen must update their application through PC-III at
         their CSS or MPF, and submit a formal application if required. The EQUAL-Plus advertisement
         or SPECAT Guide will list any unique application requirements. Only one special duty applica-
         tion may be submitted for consideration at a time. Airmen may submit applications for consider-
         ation for SDA as follows:
             A16.9.3.3.1. Airmen assigned OS with an established DEROS can apply for EQUAL-Plus
             ads if their DEROS coincides with the reporting date of the SDA. DEROS extensions may be
             considered for an EQUAL-Plus assignment but not curtailments.
             A16.9.3.3.2. Airmen assigned OS with an indefinite DEROS can apply for EQUAL-Plus ads
             provided the advertised RNLTD is after completion of the initial prescribed tour. If selected, a
             DEROS will be established which is consistent with the RNLTD of the SDA.
             A16.9.3.3.3. Airmen serving a CONUS stabilized tour may apply for an SDA but reassign-
             ment will not be considered until after the expiration date of the stabilized tour.
      A16.9.4. Application Procedures for a SDA.
         A16.9.4.1. General Information. Some MAJCOMs, organizations, and activities have SDAs and
         are authorized to receive applications from airmen or advertise SDA requirements on
         EQUAL-Plus. The controlling command or organization may initiate assignment requests on air-
         men who are applicants, and assignment instructions will be provided upon approval of PCS by
         the assignment OPR. For other SDAs, a formal routing application process is neither feasible nor
         necessary. Because of the large number of SDAs, it is not economical or feasible to publish and
         maintain a grade, AFSC, and location requirements list, mission statements, base support informa-
         tion, etc. Interested airmen may obtain such information on their own from the base library, by
         personal correspondence to the activity, from the POC listed in the EQUAL-Plus advertisement,
         from base OPRs for a subject, and so on, to assist them in deciding whether or not to volunteer.
         Airmen volunteering for a specific SDA are considered only for the type of special duty and loca-
         tions requested unless contacted and they expand or change their preferences or type of duty, or
         they are selected as a nonvolunteer. In addition to the minimum eligibility criteria listed in para-
         graph A16.9.3., additional eligibility criteria for specific duties are shown in the EQUAL-Plus
         advertisement, if applicable. Waivers to criteria in the EQUAL-Plus advertisement, to volunteer
         for SDA consideration, or actual PCS, may be requested from the controlling command or activity
         for SDAs or the HQ AFPC assignment OPR for SDAs, or the OPR listed in the EQUAL-Plus
         advertisement. After selection for PCS, there may be other factors which could render an airman
         ineligible or unqualified for PCS.
         A16.9.4.2. Required Actions for MAJCOM or Organization-Controlled SDAs.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 337


        A16.9.4.2.1. The MPF or member provides any documentation required by the EQUAL-Plus
        advertisement. If the applicant is married to another military member, include the spouse's
        identification data (grade, name, SSN, CAFSC, organization, location, branch of service) and
        any information which should be considered in conjunction with the application for the SDA
        PCS.
        A16.9.4.2.2. The application must contain the specific job number reflected in the
        EQUAL-Plus ad.
        A16.9.4.2.3. When photographs are required as part of the application process, write the name
        and SSN of the applicant on the reverse of the photograph with a felt-tip marker.
        A16.9.4.2.4. When a controlling activity receives an application, they will either initiate the
        assignment request if a requirement exists, or return the application if the airman is unqualified
        (to include why the applicant is unqualified). Applications for professional military education
        (PME) instructor, recruiter, or AETC instructor may be considered for 12 months.
        A16.9.4.2.5. The controlling activity verifies the current status of the applicant before initiat-
        ing an assignment request. The assignment OPR may disapprove an activity's request if the
        airman's status has changed since the date of original application, or assignment is not in the
        overall best interests of the AF.
     A16.9.4.3. Required Actions for HQ AFPC Controlled SDAs.
        A16.9.4.3.1. Airmen who desire to apply for an HQ AFPC-controlled SDA must meet the
        minimum eligibility criteria listed in paragraph A16.9.2., and any additional criteria listed in
        the EQUAL-Plus advertisement. For some activities no other documentation is necessary
        other than a properly processed AF Form 392. In other instances, when required by the
        EQUAL-Plus advertisement, other application procedures may be required.
        A16.9.4.3.2. The application must contain the specific job number reflected in the
        EQUAL-Plus ad
        A16.9.4.3.3. When photographs are required as part of the application process, write the name
        and SSN of the applicant on the reverse of the photograph with a felt-tip marker.
        A16.9.4.3.4. When a hard-copy application is required, either the assignment authority or the
        gaining activity will initiate reassignment if a requirement exists, return the application if the
        airman is unqualified with the reason not qualified, or retain the application for a future
        requirement. Applications are not normally retained more than 12 months; however, this var-
        ies between activities. The current status of the applicant should be verified before an assign-
        ment request is initiated or assignment is directed.
        A16.9.4.3.5. When an application for SDA requires only an update in the PDS (no hard copy
        application/documentation needed), the airman’s volunteer status remains valid until either
        selected for the SDA or volunteer status is changed via PC-III or by submitting an updated AF
        Form 392.
  A16.9.5. Procedures for Advertising Requirements Through EQUAL-Plus.
     A16.9.5.1. The SDA unit or organization requests to advertise a unique requirement through
     EQUAL-Plus by forwarding the request (with justification) to the functional community of the
     servicing MAJCOM for initial consideration. Upon review and validation by the functional com-
338                                             AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      munity, the request will be provided to the MAJCOM/DPAA for further consideration. If the
      request is approved by HQ AFPC, it will be placed on EQUAL-Plus for advertisement.
      A16.9.5.2. Units or organizations with authorizations requiring recurring advertising through
      EQUAL-Plus not already approved, should submit their fully justified requests to the functional
      community of their servicing MAJCOM. After review and validation, the functional community
      will provide these requests to the MAJCOM/DPAA for further consideration. Since requests of
      this nature usually necessitate a manning point change, they must be forwarded to HQ AFPC/
      DPAAS2 for further processing and final disposition.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    339

                           AIR FORCE ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM (AFAS)
                              (OFFICERS - LT COL AND BELOW)

A17.1. Purpose. The primary goal of the AFAS is simple--assign the right officer to the right position at
the right time to meet AF mission requirements. Other considerations include an officer’s professional
development, personal preferences and commander’s recommendation. Assignment of judge advocate
officers in the grades of Lt Col and below do not fall under the purview of AFAS.

A17.2. How AFAS Works. HQ AFPC Officer Assignment Teams are comprised of assignment person-
nel who, for the most part, hold the same AFSC as the one they’re managing. Having supply officers
work supply officer assignments, fighter pilots work fighter pilot assignments, and so on, allows for
insight into the unique manning and qualification requirements for positions in that specialty. The AFAS
is managed through the Personnel Requirements Display and by use of a Preference Worksheet. Both are
discussed in the following paragraphs.

A17.3. Personnel Requirements Display (PRD). The PRD is a key component of the AFAS. It serves
as an information source and provides officers a planning tool by displaying assignment opportunities
around the world. It is available through the HQ AFPC World Wide Web page and consists of two parts,
the authorizations listing and the requirements listing.
   A17.3.1. Authorizations Listing. This lists, by AFSC and location, all unclassified positions within
   each specialty across the AF as reflected on AF manpower files, and provides officers an idea of the
   different types of assignments available throughout the AF. Officers and their preference worksheet
   reviewer may use this listing to aid in completing preference worksheets, and it can also be used to
   assist in long term career planning. This listing is updated monthly to reflect the latest authorization
   changes.
   A17.3.2. Requirements Listing. This lists projected requirements which HQ AFPC will work to fill.
   It is designed to help officers who are eligible for reassignment. It is important to remember that not
   all requirements will be listed, and also that some requirements listed may not be filled via a PCS
   move. Direct-hire positions and short-notice fills are examples of requirements which may not
   receive visibility. Examples of positions listed which appear to go unfilled are those which are filled
   internally or with an accession. Remember this portion of the PRD is only a projection of the assign-
   ments which will be worked over the next several months. It will be updated and made visible in con-
   junction with established assignment windows.

A17.4. Preference Worksheet.. The worksheet is the key document officers use to document and make
their personal assignment preferences known, and by the officer’s preference worksheet reviewer to doc-
ument and make known recommendations for the officer’s next assignment to his or her HQ AFPC
Officer Assignment team. The worksheet is available through the HQ AFPC World Wide Web Page or as
a “hard copy” form. The hard copy version is to be used only as an exception in cases where an officer
does not have internet capability. In either case, reviewers must complete their portion of the form before
it will be accepted by HQ AFPC.
   A17.4.1. When to Submit a Preference Worksheet. Officers can submit a worksheet at any time, but
   only the most recent is kept on file. It is very important to have a current worksheet on file if eligible
340                                                     AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      for reassignment. Otherwise assignment teams will not have an officer’s preferences available for
      consideration when making assignments. Not having a worksheet will not preclude reassignment
      action.
      A17.4.2. What to List the Preference Worksheet. Section I of the worksheet contains routine identi-
      fication information on. Section II is the area where the officer makes known his or her assignment
      preferences. The worksheet can tell the HQ AFPC assignment team whether the type of duty or the
      location is the officer’s overriding goal. The officer can list up to five preferences in Section II, using
      either a wide range of preferences, very specific preferences, or a combination of both. Section III
      allows the officer to provide additional comments which may clarify or add to the preferences listed in
      Section II. Section IV is where the officer’s preference worksheet reviewer makes his or her com-
      ments. It is important for the AFAS’ success that reviewers include an accurate, honest assessment of
      the officer’s qualifications and overall suitability to perform the duties he or she prefers, or the duties
      recommended. Remember, the worksheet is neither a promotion recommendation nor an OPR--it will
      only be used for assignment purposes.

                      SWAP ASSIGNMENT PROGRAM, OS RETURNEES
                                  (AIRMEN ONLY)

A18.1. Purpose. To allow an airman returning from OS to change (SWAP) their CONUS assignment
with another returning airman who also wants an assignment SWAP.

A18.2. Who is Eligible for a SWAP? Only airmen:
   A18.2.1. In grade TSgt and below who are returning from OS, and
   A18.2.2. Whose DEROS is in the same 3-month period as shown in Attachment 16, paragraph
   A16.6. (OS Returnee Cycle Schedule), and
   A18.2.3. Whose grade, (including projected grade), and CAFSC (seven positions) match, and
   A18.2.4. Who have the same SEI, if either CONUS assignment requires an SEI.

A18.3. Who is Not Eligible for a SWAP?
   A18.3.1. Officers, MSgts (including selectees) and above.
   A18.3.2. Airmen with a voluntary COT assignment.
   A18.3.3. Airmen with an assignment to a selectively manned activity.
   A18.3.4. Airmen who are projected for separation or retirement.
   A18.3.5. Airmen with a MAJCOM-initiated assignment, a Humanitarian/EFMP assignment, a FO or
   HB assignment, or a join-spouse assignment.
   A18.3.6. Airmen who do not have a DEROS within the same 3-month period as shown in Attach-
   ment 16, paragraph A16.6.
   A18.3.7. Airmen who do not meet quality control criteria as outlined in paragraph 2.40.
   A18.3.8. Airmen who are projected for formal school training.

A18.4. Application Procedures.
   A18.4.1. An airman wishing to participate in the SWAP program must, upon receipt of his or her
   CONUS assignment, submit an AF Form 392 listing up to eight specific bases, locales, states, or areas
   to the MPF. If an airman wants to SWAP his or her assignment for any CONUS assignment, the
   eighth preference should state “CONUS-wide.” Preferences are considered in the order listed, that is
   the first assignment preference is considered before the second, and so on.
   A18.4.2. Airmen must enter the following statement on the reverse side of the AF Form 392: “I am
   applying for a CONUS Assignment SWAP. I understand this application constitutes a waiver of the
   60-day order-in-hand rule and that as a result of this application an attempt will be made to change my
   CONUS assignment with another airman returning from OS in the same returnee cycle who possesses
   the same qualifications and who also applies for an assignment SWAP. I also understand my initial
   assignment will remain firm unless I am officially notified that this CONUS Assignment SWAP has
   been approved.”

      A18.4.3. The MPF, in-turn, updates a PTI 550 transaction as outlined in AFCSM 36-699, chapter 5.
      This automatically triggers a computer search at HQ AFPC in an attempt to match your request with
      another airman who wants a SWAP.
      A18.4.4. Applicants are notified of approval or disapproval about 60 days before DEROS.

             WASHINGTON, DC AREA TOTAL TIME ASSIGNED MANAGEMENT
                               (OFFICERS ONLY)

A19.1. Washington, DC Area Total Time Assigned Management. Assignments of officers to, from,
and within the Washington, DC area must serve to replenish staff positions with fresh expertise from the
field, provide timely return of officers with staff experience to the field, be in the best interests of the AF
and, to the degree possible, consistent with individual officer professional development. It is recognized
there will be times when an extension of present assignment or consecutive assignments to the Washing-
ton, DC area serve the best interests of the AF. There is no arbitrary maximum period of time an officer
may be assigned within the area. However, continued assignment or consecutive assignment of officers
(line and non-line) totaling more than 4 years within the Washington, DC area will be carefully managed
according to the guidance herein and in the following paragraphs with approval level of extensions and
reassignments as shown in Figure A19.1. and Figure A19.2. Further, a 2-year intervening minimum
period is required between assignments in the Washington, DC area as explained in paragraph A19.9. and
Figure A19.3.

A19.2. Definition of Washington, DC Area. The Washington, DC area includes the following locations
(this definition does not necessarily coincide with the Washington, DC area as defined for any other pur-
pose):
   A19.2.1. Washington, DC;
   A19.2.2. In Virginia, the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William and the cities of
   Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas and Manassas Park; and
   A19.2.3. In Maryland, the counties of Prince George’s and Montgomery.

A19.3. When Total Time Restarts. The total time assigned to the Washington, DC area restarts when an
officer is assigned for 2 years or more outside the area. See paragraph A19.9.

A19.4. Time Assigned as a Student. Time assigned within the Washington, DC area as a student (AFIT,
PME, formal training course) does not count towards total time assigned. For example, an officer with no
previous assignment in the area is assigned to a stabilized tour in the Washington, DC area for 4 years and
then is assigned to PME also within the area for a period of 9 months. Approval to remain assigned as a
student beyond 4 years is not required. However, if a post-PME assignment is proposed which is within
the Washington, DC area and the assignment is to a 3 year stabilized tour, then total time assigned
approval for a period of 7 years is required. See Figure A19.2.

A19.5. Operational Assignments Within the Washington, DC Area. O p e r a t i o n a l a s s i g n m e n t s
(defined as assignment to a unit under the operational control of a MAJCOM) within the Washington, DC
area when no stabilized tour is authorized for the officer's organization or position, are not within the pur-
view of this policy. Similarly, consecutive operational assignments within the area are not within the pur-
view of this policy. Officers may remain assigned in an operational assignment within the Washington,
DC area beyond 4 years or be assigned to consecutive operational assignments without approval of an
extension of total time assigned.
344                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


A19.6. Extension of Total Time Assigned. An extension of stabilized tour and extension of total time
assigned in the Washington, DC area are separate and distinct considerations. Both extensions may be
included in the same request, but should address that both a current tour extension and a total time
assigned extension are requested, when applicable. An officer's date arrived station (DAS) is not always
a true reflection of total time assigned to the area; therefore, the assignment OPR will review an officer's
Washington, DC assignment history whenever an extension of current stabilized tour is requested to
determine if a total time assigned extension is also necessary. For example, a 1 year extension of a current
3 year stabilized tour may, in fact, be a fifth or sixth year extension of total time assigned to the area. Use
Figure A19.1. to determine the approval level for extension of total time assigned.

A19.7. Stabilized Tour Extension. Stabilized tours are designated as either maximum or minimum tours
(see Attachment 1, definitions).
      A19.7.1. Extensions of minimum tours are not appropriate. Upon expiration of the minimum stabi-
      lized tour period, officers remain assigned until selected for reassignment based on normal PCS selec-
      tion criteria. Approval of an extension of total time assigned in the area is not required for assignment
      for more than 4 years after minimum tour expiration.
      A19.7.2. Maximum tours require either mandatory reassignment upon tour expiration or approval of
      a tour extension and extension of total time assigned to Washington, DC area, when applicable. Offic-
      ers will not remain assigned to maximum tours after expiration of tour without an approved extension
      of tour and extension of total time assigned.

A19.8. Consecutive Assignments Within the Washington, DC Area. When consecutive assignments
within the Washington, DC area are proposed, the total time assigned upon projected completion of the
proposed assignment determines the approval level required. An officer's DAS is not always a true reflec-
tion of total time assigned in the Washington, DC area; therefore, the assignment OPR will review an
officer's Washington, DC assignment history whenever a consecutive assignment is proposed to deter-
mine if a total time assigned extension is also necessary. The total time computation is based upon any
previous assignments in the Washington, DC area, the current assignment (stabilized tour or operational
assignment) in combination with the kind of assignment proposed (stabilized tour or operational assign-
ment) according to guidance above and in Figure A19.2.

A19.9. Interval Between Assignments Within the Washington, DC Area. Following an assignment
in the Washington, DC area, a minimum interval of 2 years is required before a return assignment to the
area. The intent is that officers serve an operational field assignment in an awarded specialty during the
intervening period. An assignment to a school tour where the member is in a student status is not consid-
ered an operational field assignment. When an officer is being considered for assignment to the Washing-
ton, DC area, the assignment OPR must conduct a review of previous assignment history to determine if
an officer has been assigned to the area within the past 2 years. The approval level required for return
assignment with less than 2 years is shown in Figure A19.3.

A19.10. AF/JAX is the approval authority for judge advocates for Washington, DC area total time
assigned requests to include extension of tours, consecutive assignments and assignments with less than
the 2 year interval.

NOTES:
1. Officers assigned to an organization which is not authorized a stabilized tour, assigned to an
organization under the operational control of a MAJCOM, or who are assigned to an organization
authorized a minimum stabilized tour but the officer's minimum stabilized tour AAC has expired, do not
require an extension of total time assigned provided they remain assigned to their current organization
and remain in place.
2. When assignment is to a DoD activity, the extension must also be approved in accordance with the
DoD activity extension approval requirements. If the assignment officer disapproves the extension
request, it is not processed to the DoD approval authority.
3. For disapproval, HQ AFPC/DPA may elevate the signature level for disapproval memo to a level
appropriate for reply to the requester.
4. For Secretariat and Air Staff tour extensions only, when HQ AFPC/DPA:
   a. Recommends approval then the extension must be finally approved as follows:
   (1) Up to 5 years on current Secretariat tour: The two position office within the Secretariat
(Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or Director) must approve, with SAF/AAP coordination.
    (2) Up to 5 years on current Air Staff tour: The DCS, ACS, or comparable staff level must
approve, with SAF/AAP coordination.
    (3) For more than 5 years on current Secretariat or Air Staff tour: SAF/AAP will coordinate
and SAF/MIM must approve.
   b. Recommends disapproval of the extension, the requester may accept the disapproval or forward
along with HQ AFPC/DPA recommendation to the approval authority (same as shown in note 4.1
above), with an information copy of the forwarding memo to HQ AFPC/DPA. If the approval authority
approves the request, HQ AFPC/DPA may elevate the disagreement to AF/CVA for Air Staff, or SAF/
MI for the Secretariat, for resolution.

NOTES:
1. An operational assignment is defined as an assignment to a unit under the operational control of a
   MAJCOM and no stabilized tour is authorized for the organization or the member’s position. If the
   current organization or member's current position is authorized a stabilized tour or projected organi-
   zation or projected position is authorized a stabilized tour, then use the appropriate stabilized tour
   rule.
2. Time assigned within the Washington, DC area as a student (AFIT, PME, formal training course)
   does not count towards the total time assigned.

    OS TOUR ELECTION, COMMAND SPONSORSHIP, INDIVIDUALLY SPONSORED
         DEPENDENTS, ACQUIRED DEPENDENTS, AND DEPENDENTS OS

A20.1. OS Tour Election.
   A20.1.1. A member with dependents must elect to serve an OS tour either accompanied by depen-
   dents or unaccompanied when he or she has accepted a PCS to an OS location where an accompanied
   tour is authorized (as shown in Table 3.1.), and election of such a tour is not restricted (for example,
   by grade or by a CSPL). The member accomplishes this election by completing and signing AF Form
   965, Oversea Tour Election Statement. A copy of the form is filed in the member's UPRG and
   assignment relocation folder. The purpose of the form is to record the member's choice of OS tour and
   their understanding of the entitlements associated with their choice. Choosing an accompanied tour
   requires the member serve the usually longer accompanied tour length which, in turn, affects the
   amount of service retainability and/or ADSC associated with their election. Members must obtain any
   additional service retainability or accept the associated ADSC upon signing the AF Form 965 when:
   approval of concurrent travel (CCTVL) is automatic, when command sponsorship (and change of
   tour election) is being requested after arrival OS, or within 15 calendar days of the reply to an advance
   application for CCTVL. Members must not be permitted to receive or use any of the entitlements
   associated with travel of dependents (or command sponsorship) without the full prescribed retainabil-
   ity. Members who have dependents must be briefed that they should not elect the unaccompanied tour
   at the time of PCS notification unless they are certain they do not, and will not at any time during their
   OS tour, desire to be accompanied by dependents. Members undecided or uncertain whether or not
   they want to be accompanied by dependents should be advised to elect the accompanied tour. Mem-
   bers can change their tour from accompanied to unaccompanied before departure on PCS or after
   arrival OS as shown below, and may request cancellation of an extension of enlistment, SPTC exe-
   cuted, or ADSC accepted for the purpose of serving an accompanied tour as authorized in the pre-
   scribing instruction for these actions.
   A20.1.2. Completion of a tour election is not required for a member who does not have dependents,
   or when there is no accompanied tour length authorized at the OS location (see Table 3.1.), or when
   there is an accompanied tour length authorized at the location but the member is restricted from elect-
   ing the accompanied tour (for example, when election of the accompanied tour is restricted by a
   CSPL, by grade, etc.).
   A20.1.3. Travel of dependents at government expense may be authorized concurrently with the mem-
   ber's PCS travel when “automatic” CCTVL is authorized as shown in the PCS Notification RIP.
   NOTE: If dependents delay CCTVL for personal reasons, they may travel later to the OS location
   under authority of the initial PCS order.
   A20.1.4. When CCTVL of dependents is not automatic, the losing MPF will send an advance appli-
   cation requesting CCTVL per AFCSM 36-699. The member is advised by the MPF of reply and is
   then required to make a tour election. A reply to the advance application must be received before the
   member signs the AF Form 965. This advance request and reply does not take the place of the AF
   Form 1466, Request for Family Member’s Medical and Education Clearance for Travel and
   Dependent Relocation Clearance which must be processed before OS travel of dependents may be
   authorized. The AF Form 1466 is used to advise the gaining medical treatment facility (MTF) of any
350                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      medical or educational problems the dependents have so a determination can be made if proper medi-
      cal care or school needs are available. Gaining MTFs reply to advance applications as soon as possi-
      ble to ensure members have the needed information to make a tour election. If the dependents are not
      cleared for travel, the MPF will counsel the member on options outlined in Attachment 7, Humani-
      tarian and EFMP. EXCEPTION: Students whose dependents are not collocated with them should be
      encouraged to elect the accompanied tour and obtain an approved AF Form 1466 while en route and
      hand carry it to the OS location.
         A20.1.4.1. If travel of dependents OS is approved but travel is not authorized concurrent with the
         sponsor's PCS travel, then the reply to the advance application must indicate the length of delay
         for dependent travel. The length of delay must be either:
         A20.1.4.2. Less than 20 weeks, in which case the member is entitled to move dependents at gov-
         ernment expense only to the OS location. When it is determined at what time dependents will
         actually be authorized to travel, the OS MPF will issue dependent travel orders with appropriate
         instructions, or
         A20.1.4.3. Twenty weeks or more, in which case the member is entitled to move dependents at
         government expense to a designated place while waiting authorization to move to the OS location.
         When it is determined at what time dependents will actually be authorized to travel, the OS MPF
         will issue dependent travel orders with appropriate instructions. If the dependents moved to a des-
         ignated place awaiting further travel, they may move again at government expense to the OS duty
         location.
      A20.1.5. Before departure on PCS: A member who had dependents but initially elected an unaccom-
      panied tour and who now wants to change his or her OS tour election to the accompanied tour, must
      be afforded the opportunity to change or make an election as soon as possible. This also applies to a
      member who acquires dependents before departure on PCS. See Table 3.7. for approval authority. A
      member who delays notifying the MPF of a change in status or when the change occurs too close to
      member's PCS departure to permit routine dependent OS relocation processing (that is, as obtaining
      shots, passport/visa, dependent medical clearance, etc.) may have to proceed on PCS without depen-
      dents in order to comply with the RNLTD. In such cases, dependents may have to travel later to join
      the member after his or her arrival OS and only after dependent OS relocation processing has been
      completed. NOTE: If a member is considering moving dependents at personal expense (including to
      the OS area), they should be counseled by the Financial Services Office (FSO) to determine if per the
      JFTR any problem would exist in reimbursing the member for expenses before issuance of written
      orders authorizing the movement of dependents at government expense.
      A20.1.6. After departure on PCS: After departure from current base on PCS, but before arrival at the
      next OS duty station, if a change occurs affecting a member's previous tour election or requiring the
      member make an election (for example, the member gets married), he or she must normally wait until
      arrival at the next permanent duty station to request a change of tour election or to make an initial
      election unless marriage is to another military member who has dependents, then see Attachment 8,
      paragraph A8.6.1.3. After departure on PCS, members who marry another military member who has
      dependents and when the military couple wants to be assigned to the same location, they must not wait
      until arrival at their next duty station. Although the circumstances vary, it is not practical for an MPF
      to attempt to assist members who are en route PCS with a tour election change. Requesting approval
      from the OS duty station for travel of dependents (unless CCTVL is automatic), processing of depen-
      dents for OS travel (shots, passport/visa, dependent medical clearance, etc.), obtaining additional ser-
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 351


   vice retainability or additional ADSC, if necessary, and other actions normally completed at the losing
   base prior to departure are difficult or sometimes impossible to accomplish in a compressed period of
   time at an intermediate location. If a member en route PCS requests assistance from an MPF with a
   tour election change, approval of an exception per paragraph 1.5. is required. Again, if marriage is to
   another military member, then see Attachment 8, paragraph A8.6.1.3.; members must not wait until
   arrival at the next duty station. NOTE: If a member is considering movement of dependents at per-
   sonal expense (including to the OS area), they should be counseled by the FSO to determine if, per the
   JFTR, any problem would exist in reimbursing the member for expenses before issuance of written
   orders authorizing the movement of dependents at government expense.
   A20.1.7. After arrival OS: A request for change of tour election from accompanied to unaccompa-
   nied must be approved according to the guidelines in Table 3.8. Normally the MPF can approve a
   request when dependents and/or HHGs have not joined the member in the OS area at government
   expense. A request for change of tour election from unaccompanied to accompanied for the purpose
   of securing command sponsorship is included as a part of a member's request for command sponsor-
   ship as shown in paragraph A20.2.

A20.2. Command Sponsorship. Command sponsorship is approval of the OS installation commander
or designated representative for dependents to reside with the member at the OS duty station. See the
JFTR, Appendix A, for definitions of dependents. Provided they meet the eligibility criteria, members
will be given every opportunity to be granted command sponsorship. While a member is not entitled by
statute to command sponsorship or to serve an accompanied tour, there are statutory entitlements associ-
ated with approval of command sponsorship. Normally, for a member who has dependents at the time of
initial PCS notification and who elects the accompanied tour, approval of command sponsorship entitles
a member to receive OS station allowances at the "with dependents" rate, shipment of HHGs and/or travel
of dependents to and from the OS duty station at government expense, and authorizes dependents to
receive other benefits and privileges associated with command sponsorship. When dependents are not
entitled to travel and/or shipment of HHGs to the OS duty station at government expense (for example,
acquired dependents [see Attachment 1]), or when dependents travel to the OS duty station at the mem-
ber's personal expense, then command sponsorship (with concurrent tour status change) must be
requested and approved according to paragraph A20.2.4.
   A20.2.1. An OS installation commander or designated representative evaluates requests from eligible
   members and approves command sponsorship when the member satisfies all of the following eligibil-
   ity criteria:
       A20.2.1.1. The member is projected to be assigned (or is currently assigned) to a duty location
       where an accompanied by dependents tour is authorized (see Table 3.1.), election of the accompa-
       nied tour is not restricted (such as by a Command Sponsored Position List (CSPL), by grade, etc.),
       and the member has completed an AF Form 965 electing to serve the accompanied tour (may be
       either a change to a previous election or an initial election).
       EXCEPTION: Members assigned to Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a
       territory or possession of the United States, who marry or adopt a person who is a bona fide resi-
       dent of the state, commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States, will be authorized
       station allowances as members "with dependents." A bona fide resident is defined as a person
       who, before becoming a military dependent, made his or her actual and legal domicile in the state,
       commonwealth, territory, or possession. Transportation of dependents will be paid at government
352                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


         expense incident to PCS upon member completing at least the unaccompanied OS tour length.
         This also applies to an employee of the United States stationed in the respective area. These enti-
         tlements apply whether or not the member elects to serve the accompanied tour length.
         A20.2.1.2. Travel of dependents to the OS duty station at government expense has not been pro-
         hibited or suspended by appropriate authority for any of the reasons listed in paragraph A20.4.3.
         When a request for command sponsorship does not involve travel of dependents at government
         expense to the OS duty station, this criterion does not apply.
         A20.2.1.3. Adequate dependent support can be provided by local facilities if travel of dependents
         at government expense is involved. When a member has dependents and requests travel at gov-
         ernment expense to the OS duty station, an AF Form 1466 must be processed according to AFI
         36-3020, Family Member Travel. However, when travel of dependents at government expense is
         not requested (for example, travel was at the member's expense), or the member is not entitled to
         travel of dependents at government expense (for example, dependents were acquired after mem-
         ber's arrival OS), then an AF Form 1466 for the purpose of approving travel of dependents at gov-
         ernment expense is not a prerequisite for approval of command sponsorship. However, command
         sponsorship requests not involving travel of dependents at government expense must include a
         statement of support/clearance from the local medical and/or education activity. The purpose of
         the statement of support/clearance is to enable local officials to identify a dependent with special
         educational needs or need for medically-related services incident to an individualized education
         plan (IEP), or early intervention services incident to an individualized family service plan (IFSP).
         Identification of dependents who qualify under the EFMP ensures the member will receive coun-
         seling on the availability or lack of availability of facilities and will permit EFMP consideration in
         conjunction with their next assignment. Similarly, the statement of support/clearance is to enable
         local medical officials to identify individuals who may have medical problems which cannot be
         treated locally. Identification of dependents with medical problems which cannot be treated
         locally allows medical officials to counsel members in advance on what they can anticipate in the
         event of a medical emergency. Members with dependents with serious or life threatening medical
         conditions which cannot be treated locally should reconsider their decision to have dependents
         reside with them at the OS duty station. Installation commanders will then use the information
         and recommendations received to form the basis for approving a member’s request, or for recom-
         mending it be disapproved by the appropriate authority (see paragraph A20.2.3.).
         A20.2.1.4. The member possesses or is eligible to obtain the required service retainability and
         serve the ADSC associated with the accompanied tour length. Members who are ineligible to
         obtain retainability are ineligible for command sponsorship. It is not considered denial of com-
         mand sponsorship when a member cannot satisfy the retainability requirements for approval of
         command sponsorship.
      A20.2.2. After arrival OS, approval of a member's request for command sponsorship results in an
      adjustment of DEROS as shown in Table 3.9. A tour election change is not an extension of OS tour
      (although many of the extension procedures are used), and is therefore not subject to disapproval for
      the same reasons as a request for extension of OS tour. Airmen serving on an unaccompanied
      extended long OS tour who request and receive command sponsorship must serve the accompanied
      tour length plus 12 additional months.
      A20.2.3. Revoking or denying command sponsorship to a member who meets all of the eligibility
      requirements may only be authorized by the SAF. Command sponsorship may not be disapproved due
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                             353


  to quality control problems of either the member or dependents, based on manning, or based on the
  criteria normally considered for OS tour extension requests. A request to revoke or deny command
  sponsorship must be originated by the installation commander (for example, when local facilities are
  inadequate to care for a dependent with a serious medical condition but no travel of dependents at
  government expense is involved) with information copy to the MPF. Requests will contain a complete
  description of the situation and address why approval of command sponsorship would not be in the
  best interests of the AF, the member, and/or dependents. Requests will be forwarded to the MAJ-
  COM/DPA for a recommendation of approval or disapproval and forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1.
  HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 will make a recommendation and forward to AF/DPF, who will also make a rec-
  ommendation and forward to SAF for a final decision.
  A20.2.4. Members serving OS on an unaccompanied tour must request and receive approval of com-
  mand sponsorship. Approval of command sponsorship is also approval of an accompanied tour elec-
  tion. A member's request must be submitted to the installation commander or designated
  representative and must include:
     A20.2.4.1. Reason for request and justification.
     A20.2.4.2. Date departed last duty station and date departed CONUS.
     A20.2.4.3. If applicable, address to which dependents and HHG were moved incident to mem-
     ber's PCS to current location.
     A20.2.4.4. Name of spouse and name, age, sex, and relationship of all dependents for whom com-
     mand sponsorship is requested.
     A20.2.4.5. Location of dependents and HHGs at the present time, and whether dependents and/or
     HHGs were shipped to present location at government expense or member's expense.
     A20.2.4.6. If applicable, place to which the government last paid for movement of dependents
     and/or HHGs if other than as shown in paragraph A20.2.4.3. or A20.2.4.4., and include why
     movement from that place to current location was made.
     A20.2.4.7. Copy of PCS orders directing PCS to current OS duty station including all amend-
     ments.
     A20.2.4.8. If applicable, the waiting period for move of dependents to the OS area. Attach a copy
     of the reply to the member's advance application for CCTVL.
     A20.2.4.9. If applicable, copy of previous AF Forms 965 executed and a signed copy of AF Form
     965 with new election.
     A20.2.4.10. Copy of any previous AF Forms 1466 (approved or disapproved) executed in con-
     nection with PCS to current location, if applicable. As stated in paragraph A20.2.1.3., an AF
     Form 1466 processed in support of the current request (including when travel of dependents at
     government expense is not involved) should be included. Requests which do not include an AF
     Form 1466 may preclude the installation commander or designated representative from making a
     determination on the member's request.
  A20.2.5. When a member requests command sponsorship (and change of tour status from unaccom-
  panied to accompanied) and as outlined in Table 3.8. has used the government transportation entitle-
  ment for his or her family and/or HHGs, then the member must submit a request through the
  installation commander or designated representative with the information required by paragraphs
354                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      A20.2.4., through the MAJCOM/DPA for a recommendation to HQ AFPC/DPAPP1. HQ AFPC/
      DPAPP1 will approve or disapprove, or it may be necessary to process the request to a higher level.
      The intent is to grant a change of tour only in cases where it is proven that the main reason the member
      chose the unaccompanied tour and/or moved either dependents or HHGs at government expense, was
      due to official AF actions. The member must show that an official AF action caused the use of trans-
      portation entitlements and, had it not been for the AF's action, it would clearly have been the mem-
      ber's intent to have dependents accompany him or her at the OS duty station. Official AF actions are
      written directions from AF officials responsible to issue such directions as part of their official duty
      that caused a member to use his or her transportation entitlements.
      A20.2.6. If one member of a married military couple separates or retires from an OS station and
      remains in the vicinity of the duty station of the military spouse who is serving the accompanied tour
      length, the separating or retiring member may be command sponsored effective the day following the
      last day of active duty. If the military spouse is not serving an accompanied tour, he or she must be
      eligible to request and obtain approval of command sponsorship to receive the associated allowances.
      A20.2.7. Command sponsorship of a dependent may be transferred to another military sponsor pro-
      vided the acquired dependent has been command sponsored at least 12 months preceding transfer. For
      example, a command sponsored dependent marries a member who is serving an unaccompanied tour.
      The new sponsor does not have to serve an accompanied tour in order for the dependent to receive
      travel at government expense upon completion of the new sponsor's tour.
      A20.2.8. A member who was accompanied at the current duty station by command sponsored depen-
      dents and returns dependents early and is later joined by those same dependents at the member's
      expense, may again have the dependents command sponsored provided the sponsor (member) does
      not have an ASD for PCS from the current duty station and has at least 24 months remaining on his or
      her OS tour after approval of command sponsorship.
      A20.2.9. A member who early returns command sponsored dependents as a result of divorce may
      have newly acquired dependents command sponsored. It is not necessary for the member to obtain
      additional theater retainability. Command sponsorship carries over to the new spouse and/or depen-
      dents; however, government funded travel to the OS location is not authorized.
      A20.2.10. The effective date of approval of command sponsorship is the date approved by the instal-
      lation commander or designated representative, the date of approval for requests forwarded to a higher
      headquarters, or the date of arrival of dependents in the OS area in instances where movement at gov-
      ernment expense is involved, whichever is later.

A20.3. Individually Sponsored Dependents and Acquired Dependents. An individually sponsored
dependent (sometimes referred to as noncommand sponsored dependent) is one who either was not enti-
tled to travel to a member's OS duty station at government expense, or who may have been entitled to
travel at government expense but travels to the OS duty station without approval of the OS installation
commander. An acquired dependent is one who became a dependent after the start of a member's current
OS tour (such as by marriage, adoption, etc.). See the JFTR, Appendix A, for definition of acquired
dependents. This term does not include persons dependent upon the member before the start of member's
current OS tour. The tour status of members with individually sponsored dependents or acquired depen-
dents is not automatically changed from unaccompanied to accompanied, nor are dependents automati-
cally granted command sponsorship. When a member wants command sponsorship of individually
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                   355


sponsored or acquired dependents, he or she must submit a request in accordance with paragraph A20.2.
and receive approval.
   A20.3.1. A change of tour election or command sponsorship is not required when dependents are
   vacationing or visiting OS in a tourist status.
   A20.3.2. See paragraph A20.2.1.1. for members assigned to Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of
   Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States, who marry or adopt a person who is a
   bona fide resident of the state, commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States,

A20.4. Dependents OS. Military dependents are citizens in their own right of the United States or for-
eign nations, so the AF is limited in what it may prohibit or direct with regard to dependent travel.
   A20.4.1. Unless travel OS is prohibited by the Department of State or the host country denies entry,
   military dependents may travel at their own expense to any foreign country. When they do so, both
   the dependents and the member should understand that the dependents may not be protected by exist-
   ing Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs).
   A20.4.2. Any dependent residing OS may be requested by a military commander to depart the OS
   location. However, neither the commander nor the AF may require dependents to leave a foreign
   country. Requiring that dependents leave a foreign country is an action which may only be taken by
   the government of the host nation under normal diplomatic protocol. However, the AF may take steps
   within its authority, including Secretarial denial or revocation of command sponsorship (which would,
   in turn, terminate OS station allowances), restricting dependents' access to the installation and/or
   facilities, denial of privileges such as use of exchange, commissary, and so on.
   A20.4.3. The decision to authorize dependent travel OS at government expense is based on the stan-
   dard of living, general desirability of the location, adequacy of dependent support facilities, political
   climate in the foreign country, possible adverse affect the presence of dependents may have on mis-
   sion accomplishment, operational readiness, or combat capability. Normally, dependent travel at gov-
   ernment expense shall not be authorized to any OS location where one or more of the above factors is
   significantly unfavorable.
   A20.4.4. All dependents in an OS area will be furnished medical care. Medical care is based on
   dependency status, not on command sponsorship. Not all OS locations have adequate medical facili-
   ties to care for all medical conditions. Accordingly, medical care for dependents who are not com-
   mand sponsored is provided according to medical guidelines and priorities.

              ASSIGNMENT OF NON-PRIOR SERVICE (NPS) PIPELINE STUDENTS
                                  (AIRMEN ONLY)

A21.1. Assignment Processing Responsibilities and Procedures.
      A21.1.1. HQ AFPC. Distributes available Operational Training Graduates (OTG) to the MAJCOMs
      on an equal basis by matching OTGs to their end assignment and providing instructions to both the
      gaining and losing MAJCOM and the MPF through either the PDS, by message, or by CRT gram.
      PDD and RNLTD will be based upon graduation date plus 25 days for CONUS assignments and grad-
      uation date plus 40 days for OS assignments.
         A21.1.1.1. Assignment selection criteria for CONUS assignments. Airmen are arranged and
         matched in order of grade, DOR, TAFMSD, date of birth (DOB) (earliest to latest) and then, if
         necessary, in reverse SSN order.
         A21.1.1.2. Assignment selection criteria for OS assignments. Arrange airmen in the same order
         as above and match volunteers first; then for nonvolunteers, reverse the order of the list so the jun-
         ior nonvolunteer is selected first and the senior nonvolunteer is selected last.

A21.2. Training Wing (TRW) Responsibilities.
      A21.2.1. The 319th Training Squadron at Lackland AFB will report basic military training (BMT)
      students classification via PTI 729 no later than the end of the fourth week of training. Immediately
      after classification, they will schedule and update via PTI PM4 in the Air Force Training Management
      System (AFTMS) all training required for award of the 3-skill level AFSC. A21.2.2. TRW registrars
      will report the students entry into operational training school, a change in technical training schedule,
      or completion of technical school to 2AF/XPAC.
      A21.2.2. Schedule students for wing-controlled follow-on training immediately upon entry into the
      basic course at the training wing.
      A21.2.3. 2AF/XPAC reports any changes to course identification number to HQ AFPC/DPAAS2 by
      message or e-mail as soon as possible after the class has been activated.

A21.3. MPF Student Assignment Section.
      A21.3.1. The MPF will notify the student, through the unit commander, of the assignment within 5
      duty days after receipt. The MPF will also establish a relocation folder and notify the training squad-
      ron of all necessary actions for the assignment. According to AFI 36-2102, Base-Level Relocation
      Procedures..
      A21.3.2. PCS orders should be accomplished and forwarded to the member as soon as possible after
      receipt of the assignment if no special processing requirements exist (i.e., PRP/SCI requirements,
      medical/dental clearances, AF Form 1466, AF Form 965, etc.).
      A21.3.3. PCS orders for assignments with special requirements or PPCs, such as those stated above,
      will be accomplished upon completion of all mandatory requirements. The chief of the student
      assignments section will establish local procedures to ensure special requirements are accomplished
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                              357


   in the most expedient manner. The process for requirements to be completed and orders processed for
   the student should be completed within 15 duty days.

A21.4. Student SWAP Program. This voluntary program was established to afford NPS student airmen
who are assigned in a PCS status at a TRW or GSU the chance to swap assignments with another student
before they graduate from technical training. Interested students are solely responsible for finding
another student who wants to swap assignments. A SWAP involves two or more NPS students (AB
through A1C). NOTE: If a TTG has an approved follow-on assignment he/she is ineligible to swap,
unless extenuating circumstances apply.
   A21.4.1. Eligibility Criteria. Airmen must:
       A21.4.1.1. Not have been notified of pending elimination from training.
       A21.4.1.2. Be projected graduates of the same course.
       A21.4.1.3. Meet or be able to satisfy all special requirements and PPC requirements before grad-
       uation.
       A21.4.1.4. Have the same Air Force specialty code (AFSC) including the same prefix and/or suf-
       fix (this does not apply to airmen who are attending the same phase I core course that is common
       to more than one AFSC).
       A21.4.1.5. Have a class graduation date within 30 days of each other.
       A21.4.1.6. Not have an assignment as a result of a SWAP (AAR SS). NOTE: Only one approved
       swap is permitted.
       A21.4.1.7. Be a US citizen if assignment is to OS (with exception of Alaska and Hawaii).
       Non-US citizens are ineligible for a SWAP to an OS assignment (other than Alaska or
       Hawaii).
       A21.4.1.8. Be a US citizen if the assignment requires access to classified information. Non-US
       citizens are ineligible for a SWAP to an assignment requiring access to classified informa-
       tion.
       A21.4.1.9. Not have a UIF or have administrative actions pending which will result in the estab-
       lishment of a UIF, if the assignment is to an OS area.

A21.5. AB through A1C may swap assignments with each other. (There are no grade restrictions for
NPS students).

A21.6. SWAP Procedures:
   A21.6.1. The SWAP request must be submitted to the MPF student assignment section not later than
   4 workdays after the student is notified of his or her assignment.
   A21.6.2. The MPF reports SWAP requests by message, CRT, or e-mail within 3 duty days to the
   assignment OPR for processing. The MPF ensures all pertinent information is contained in the report-
   ing of SWAPs. The following format will be used: NAME/SSN/OLD GPAS/NEW GPAS/AAN/
   AFSC/GRAD DT/REMARKS.
358                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      A21.6.3. A change of either assignment after a SWAP has been approved does not cancel the SWAP
      action (i.e., if either member’s assignment was changed the other would continue to the swapped
      assignment).
      A21.6.4. The assignment OPR will within 3 duty days process the request for a SWAP and either
      approve and update the PDS, or contact the MPF/GSU notifying them of disapproval.
      A21.6.5. As an exception to the above, students attending Phase II medical training in AFSCs
      4H0X1, 4J0X1, 4R0X1, 4T0X1 or 4T0X2 may apply for a SWAP regardless of their training location.
      These airmen must be reported to the assignment OPR in the same manner described above by the
      MPF servicing the training location. (NOTE: Both MPFs will maintain a copy of the SWAP request
      of each member and the MPF servicing the member whose last name occurs first in alphabetical order
      will submit the requests to the assignment OPR.)
      A21.6.6. The airmen involved must concur with the SWAP assignments in writing.

A21.7. Follow-on (FO) Assignment Program.
      A21.7.1. TRW’s will refer to AFI 36-2110, Assignments, Attachment 5, for complete guidance on
      the FO assignment program. Airmen selected for a dependent-restricted assignment (NA/12 loca-
      tions), or who elect an unaccompanied short tour (24/15 or 24/12 locations) will be briefed during
      their initial assignment briefing.
      A21.7.2. TRW’s will allow airmen 3 duty days to complete their application or decline participation
      in writing.
      A21.7.3. Airmen may apply for up to 16 preferences (8 CONUS and 8 OS, which can reflect specific
      bases, states, regions, locales, or countries).
      A21.7.4. Method of submitting requests from the technical training wing to HQ AFPC will vary
      based on the airman’s PDD. Airmen with a PDD of more than 150 days from the ASD will have their
      requests updated by the TRW via PDS using PTI 550, utilizing the AMU remarks area to identify
      requested state or region/locale areas, if desired. The transaction will generate an in-system request to
      the appropriate assignment OPR approximately 120 days prior to the airman’s PDD. In-system
      approval or disapproval from the assignment OPR will take place through PDS within 10 duty days
      after receipt. Members with a PDD within 150 days from ASD should have their preferences for-
      warded to the assignment OPRby message, CRT, e-mail, or fax. The assignment OPR will process
      these requests through the appropriate assignment OPR within 5 duty days and, if necessary, advise
      the TRW of disapproval through message, CRT, or e-mail.
      A21.7.5. Airmen must receive approval or disapproval prior to departure and those with approved FO
      assignments must have the pertinent information reflected in their PCS orders.
      A21.7.6. TRW’s can utilize available microfiche files (PBT 196) to identify locations which have
      3-level authorizations throughout the world.

A21.8. Deferment of NPS Students.
      A21.8.1. BMT Students. The following deferments or conditions prohibit the PDS from automati-
      cally classifying and matching BMT student assignments.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                               359


      A21.8.1.1. Medical/Dental Hold. Deferred with AAC 31, Table 2.1. and DOA as set by the
      Medical/Dental Facility.
      A21.8.1.2. Recommended for Separation. Defer with AAC 73 with DOA 6 months from date of
      recommendation. If previously classified, cancel projected assignment to technical training wing
      and update the Primary, Control, and Duty AFSC to 9T000.
      A21.8.1.3. HQ USAF or MAJCOM Hold. Airmen identified by the Airman Classification
      Squadron as having unique needs which will have a bearing on their assignment. On approval
      from 2AF/XPAC, the airman is placed in AAC 70 with a DOA equal to their graduation date from
      BMT. If not resolved by that date, the Airman Classification Squadron Commander will place a
      statement on the DD Form 4, Enlistment/Reenlistment Document, Armed Forces of the
      United States, waiving the problem. The DOA must never exceed the BMT graduation date.
      A21.8.1.4. Airman Classification Squadron Assessment Branch. Airmen identified for special
      processing by the assessment branch will be placed in AAC 25 with a DOA 1 workday before
      classification of the week group. A later DOA may be input manually.
      A21.8.1.5. Enlisted Under the Guarantee AFSC Program. Airmen are placed in AAC 71 with a
      DOA equal to BMT graduation date.
      A21.8.1.6. Join Spouse Applicants. Airmen are placed in AAC 69 with a DOA equal to BMT
      graduation date. The Airman Classification Squadron will ensure a join spouse requirement is
      considered during classification so that compatible AFSCs are selected.
      A21.8.1.7. Other. Airmen in a duty status code other than present for duty (code 00) are not con-
      sidered for classification or reassignment.

A21.9. Delaying a PCS Move for a NPS Student. PCS moves for NPS students may not be delayed
except:
   A21.9.1. When a humanitarian or EFMP assignment request is pending.
   A21.9.2. When a join spouse application is pending.
   A21.9.3. When PCS involves a female airman who is pregnant or an airman whose wife is pregnant,
   consistent with pregnancy deferment procedures in this instruction (see paragraphs 2.38. and 2.39.).
   A21.9.4. When the student is under consideration for a selectively manned or special-duty assign-
   ment.
   A21.9.5. When pending completion of additional assignment processing actions required by a PPC or
   awaiting approval to proceed on assignment.
   A21.9.6. When pending a response to an application for concurrent travel.
   A21.9.7. When the student is placed on Commander Directed Hold (AAC 21) or Under AFOSI/
   Security Forces Investigation (AAC 17). Commanders will validate the need to retain a student for
   further observation or contemplated administrative action. Once validated, the commander must
   immediately initiate a request to place the airman on hold. The commander’s request includes: grade,
   name, SSN, CAFSC, student status (projected graduation date, date eliminated, and so forth), applica-
   ble AAC from Table 2.1. (if different than AAC 21), rationale for action, and DOA. The request
   must be hand-carried or electronically transmitted/faxed to the MPF student assignment sec-
360                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      tion to prevent student departure. If the commander determines the member is about to depart the
      base, notify the MPF student assignment section telephonically to prevent departure. In these cases,
      written confirmation as described above is required within 1 duty day. If there is a disagreement
      between the commander and the MPF regarding a request, it is elevated to the next higher level of
      command until resolved.
         A21.9.7.1. MPFs must establish procedures to make sure action is taken to prevent departure of
         an airman upon receipt of a commander’s request. In addition, commanders will set up procedures
         to ensure the hold request is provided to the MPF student assignment section.
         A21.9.7.2. When circumstances which required the airman to be delayed cease to exist and the
         airman is qualified for reassignment, the commander takes immediate action to release the mem-
         ber, in writing. This notification is provided to the MPF student assignment section.

A21.10. Assignment of Military Couples Involving TTGs. (See Attachment 8 for complete guidance
on the join spouse assignment program).
      A21.10.1. In those situations where the student was married to another military member prior to
      BMT and an AF Form 1048 has been completed and updated in the PDS, no further action is needed
      to affect join spouse consideration. However, when the marriage occurs at the training location or
      after graduation, the following applies:
      A21.10.2. Airmen must complete an AF Form 1048 and a “hard-copy” join spouse application (see
      Figure A8.1.) to request join spouse assignment consideration as soon as possible after the date of
      marriage.
         A21.10.2.1. The MPF verifies the airman’s eligibility, update PDS, suspenses a copy of the appli-
         cation, and notifies the assignment OPR via message, CRT gram, or e-mail (info spouse’s MPF, if
         applicable). Notification should include the following information on each member:
             A21.10.2.1.1. Name (Last, First, Middle Initial).
             A21.10.2.1.2. Grade.
             A21.10.2.1.3. SSN.
             A21.10.2.1.4. CAFSC.
             A21.10.2.1.5. Graduation Date.
             A21.10.2.1.6. Current unit of assignment.
             A21.10.2.1.7. Requested assignment location.
             A21.10.2.1.8. Date of marriage and Join Spouse Intent Code.
             A21.10.2.1.9. The following mandatory statement: “The marriage certificate has been veri-
             fied and join spouse application is on file in the MPF.”
             A21.10.2.1.10. If one spouse is a member of another branch of the Armed Forces, written
             confirmation from that member confirming that join spouse is desired must be submitted with
             the join spouse application. Include the spouse’s rank, name, SSN, AFSC or MOS, job title,
             current duty location, and, if known, the name, rank, and DSN of spouse’s assignment clerk.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                   361


   A21.10.3. HQ AFPC/DPAAD6 provides the MPF the final decision via message, CRT, or E-mail.
   The MPF uses this authority to reassign students. Students must not depart until the MPF receives the
   final decision from the assignment OPR. PDS notification confirming approval (PTI 517) will follow
   depending on proximity of graduation date (NOTE: Do not delay processing pending PDS confirma-
   tion).
   A21.10.4. Students indicating they will marry en route PCS must be counseled not to delay applying
   for join spouse assignment until arrival at the new duty location. Advise them to report immediately
   to the nearest AF installation to apply. The airman will not be reimbursed for travel in conjunction
   with such application and will remain in leave status (delay en route) while the application is pending.
   A21.10.5. Airmen will not be retrained for the sole purpose of making a join spouse assignment for
   12 months after graduation from technical training. However, with approval of 2AF/XPAC, they may
   be transferred to another course before school entry or if the training already received is applicable to
   the new course.

A21.11. Student Quality Control Procedures.
   A21.11.1. Airmen (including graduates, eliminees, and unqualified students) who cannot or will not
   meet acceptable standards of conduct or duty performance are identified and separated from the Air
   Force.
   A21.11.2. All administrative or judicial actions, initiated or contemplated, are completed before the
   airman is reassigned.
   A21.11.3. NPS student assignments are mandatory PCS moves, but only to CONUS locations.
   A21.11.4. The losing commander notifies the gaining commander, in writing, when a student is rec-
   ommended for assignment and administrative action or entry into a program (weight management,
   etc.) has been established. Include an explanation of the airmen’s situation and the specific actions
   taken. If further action is desirable, but impractical, the specific reason for precluding further action
   must be fully explained.
   A21.11.5. Airmen (including graduates, eliminees, and unqualified students) are not assigned to or
   allowed to leave for any OS location or any CONUS location where a quality-control-oriented PPC
   applies AAC 10-21, excluding 14 (this does not include PRP), without the approval of HQ AFPC/
   DPAPP1.

A21.12. Security Clearance and Access to Classified Information.
   A21.12.1. Only those TTGs requiring a security clearance for award of an AFSC should be placed in
   invluntary hold status.MPFs must ensure that SCI nomination packages are forwarded to the Defense
   Investigative Service (DIS) by the local Security Police Investigative Office.
   A21.12.2. Non-US citizens are not matched against assignments that have a security clearance
   requirement.
   A21.12.3. MPFs will establish procedures to ensure security clearance requests for investigation are
   initiated no later than 3 duty days after receipt of the assignment notification. All initial clearance
   processing will be completed no later than 30 days after receipt or the graduation date, whichever is
   sooner.
362                                                     AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


A21.13. Return of Graduated Students En Route PCS.
      A21.13.1. Commanders have the ultimate responsibility of ensuring only quality personnel are
      retained in the AF and permitted to be reassigned. When an individual has departed on PCS but not
      arrived at the gaining location, the decision to cancel his or her assignment for the purpose of return-
      ing to the previous duty station must servethe overall best interests of the AF. Due to the PCS cost and
      personal hardship that may result, an individual who has departed on PCS will only be directed to
      return to the previous duty station upon approval of the assignment OPR after it is determined the
      action for which return is requested cannot be completed at the gaining unit. Requests to return an
      individual for the purpose of administering disciplinary actions (Article 15, Letter of Reprimand,
      Control Roster, or Weight Management) will normally be disapproved. The gaining commander can
      administer these actions. Members may, however, be returned for involuntary separation, court-mar-
      tial, completion of an OSI investigation, etc. It is the decision of the assignment OPR to cancel a
      member’s assignment that actually causes the member’s return to the previous duty station.
      A21.13.2. A commander considering requesting the return of an individual who has departed PCS but
      who has not arrived at the gaining location must:
         A21.13.2.1. Contact the local Judge Advocate to determine the legal sufficiency and determine if
         return is necessary.
             A21.13.2.1.1. If determined to be legally sufficient, contact the MPF Commander who will
             provide HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 the specifics of the case for their approval/disapproval. These
             actions are normally completed on the same day of the request.
         A21.13.2.2. If return is approved, the commander notifies the individual by telephone or over-
         night express mail. Telephonic notification is recommended as long as the conversation is wit-
         nessed and an appropriate memo for record is prepared. The commander must give the individual
         a specific RNLTD for his or her return. If the individual lacks funds for the return trip, advise him
         or her to report to the nearest Financial Service Office (FSO) with original PCS orders to obtain
         necessary funds and/or commercial tickets for the return travel.
         A21.13.2.3. Members returning must in-process through the MPF. If involuntary separation or
         commander hold (AAC 21) is being initiated, the individual must be notified in writing of the
         action and its ramifications prior to implementation.
         A21.13.2.4. Upon member’s return, the MPF (Personnel Employment Section) will gain the
         member back to file with a PTI 205. The original orders must be rescinded with a statement in the
         remarks that the member was ordered to return to the losing base (CONUS base) from their leave
         address (state location) by the commander. The MPF will ensure the FSO receives a copy of the
         rescission orders.

A21.14. Disposition of First Time Technical Training Eliminees.
      A21.14.1. NPS students who eliminate from their training course will be evaluated for retention in
      the Air Force. If the behavior or action that resulted in the elimination from training is grounds for
      separation, proper action is taken. If, after evaluation, it is decided to retain the airman, then the fol-
      lowing applies:
         A21.14.1.1. The MPF sends a message or e-mail to 2AF/XPAC with an information copy to HQ
         AFPC/DPAAS2 (AETC/SGPS on airmen eliminated from medical training) within 3 duty days
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                363


     after the elimination is formally approved, or 3 duty days after the decision to retain the airman
     was made. Report disqualified airmen according to AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel
     (Officers and Airmen). Message or e-mail will include the following:
         A21.14.1.1.1. Grade, name, SSN, AFSC, physical profile (PULHESX), color vision normal
         (yes or no), depth perception normal (yes or no), and whether the airman possesses a current
         state driver’s license (yes or no).
         A21.14.1.1.2. Course from which eliminated. Include the course length, start date, and date
         of final elimination action. For unqualified students, indicate only the AFSC for which mem-
         ber is unqualified.
         A21.14.1.1.3. Reasons for elimination as stated in the counseling records. For unqualified
         students, indicate the reasons for disqualification.
         A21.14.1.1.4. Up to 6 AFSC preferences for which the airman qualifies. If applicable,
         include a summary of the individual’s experience or interests that may assist in reclassifica-
         tion.
         A21.14.1.1.5. If further technical training is not recommended, give specific rationale why
         administrative separation action was not taken.
         A21.14.1.1.6. A complete account of all actions contained in the airman’s UIF, if applicable.
         A21.14.1.1.7. Any other facts, recommendations, or information that will assist in determin-
         ing a disposition that is in the best interest of the AF. Comments should include whether the
         airman is PRP certifiable, airman’s attitude and motivation, along with any other pertinent fac-
         tors. Also, include commander’s recommendation.
  A21.14.2. If reentry into another technical training course is decided, 2AF advises the MPF and the
  assignment OPR of the reclassification AFSC and course data. The assignment OPR will update the
  CAFSC and the MPF will update the PAFSC, and DAFSC to the new AFSC using PTI SCH in PDS.
  If training is at an alternate location, HQ AFPC will provide assignment instructions for the PCS or
  TDY (depending on the course length) to the appropriate TRW.
  A21.14.3. To ensure prompt disposition, 2AF and HQ AFPC will complete their required actions
  after receipt of eliminee or unqualified student reports. Each level of review must complete their
  action within 3 duty days after receipt.
  A21.14.4. Commanders must avoid multiple (more than once) reclassification of students who
  clearly do not meet acceptable standards. This includes standards of academics, performance, con-
  duct, bearing and behavior, discipline, medical, or any characteristic that does not promote accom-
  plishment of the AF’s mission. When students are recommended for reclassification more than once,
  the approval authority is the group commander.

                                               Attachment 22

               PCS OF MEMBERS DIRECTED UNDER AUTHORITY OF ANOTHER
                             PRESCRIBING INSTRUCTION
                  (LIEUTENANT COLONEL AND BELOW AND ALL AIRMEN)

A22.1. Introduction. While the term “assignments” is frequently used to describe all PCSs, the fact is
there are various types of PCS moves directed by OPRs not within the HQ AFPC Directorate of Assign-
ments which are made under the authority of another prescribing instruction. As a reminder, with the
exception of patient assignments, assignment OPRs within the HQ AFPC Directorate of Assignments are
responsible for only operational, rotational, force structure, and training PCSs.

A22.2. PCS in Conjunction With Other Actions. The following PCSs, with the exception of some
patient assignments, are directed by OPRs outside the HQ AFPC Directorate of Assignments. The OPR
for the action concerned is the OPR for the PCS and is the PCS Authority.
      A22.2.1. Accession PCSs (except for medical officers which is HQ AFPC/DPAM). OPR is HQ
      AFPC/DPPA. With the exception of those designated at the discretion of the Secretary and Chief of
      Staff, assignments of all USAF Academy graduate accessions or members cross-commissioning from
      other Service Academies will be assigned at or below the wing level.
      A22.2.2. PCS in conjunction with separation and retirement (includes for processing of administra-
      tive separation/discharge). OPR is HQ AFPC/DPPR.
      A22.2.3. PCS of patients to a medical treatment facility (MTF) or between MTFs. OPR can be either
      the gaining MTF Commander or HQ AFPC/DPAMM, Medical Standards Branch. Upon release from
      assignment to the MTF, members will be reported to HQ AFPC/DPAMM who, in turn, will request
      the assignment OPR direct reassignment as appropriate.
      A22.2.4. PCS of prisoners to a confinement facility (including from OS to a CONUS facility) or
      between confinement facilities. OPR is AF Corrections.
      A22.2.5. PCS of members to locations near their HOR who are placed in appellate leave status inci-
      dent to court-martial conviction. OPR is AF/JA.
      A22.2.6. PCS or TDY related to judicial proceedings (court-martial or other reasons when directed
      by the MAJCOM/JA) according to AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice. OPR is AF/JA.

A22.3. How PCSs Differ. The PCSs listed in paragraph A22.2. (frequently referred to as assignments)
differ from those authorized by this instruction in the following major ways:
      A22.3.1. The selection process (qualifications, ODSD/STRD, DAS, TOS, retainability, and so on)
      prescribed in this instruction to determine which individual will be selected for PCS does not apply.
      A22.3.2. The purpose of the PCS is not to fill a valid manpower authorization at the gaining location
      and/or the have the member perform duty in his/her AFSC.
      A22.3.3. The PCSs are not projected in the PDS and do not need an operational, rotational, or training
      AAN. The member is “assigned” using unprojected gain procedures provided in AFCSM 36-699.
      A22.3.4. It may not be appropriate for the cost of the PCS to be charged to the same PCS ID codes
      used for operational, rotational, and training assignments.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                               365


   A22.3.5. It is incorrect to cite AFI 36-2110, Assignments, as the “authority” for the PCS.
   A22.3.6. 7-day option procedures do not apply.

A22.4. Similarities of the PCSs. Similarities do exist between the PCSs listed in paragraph A22.2. and
those authorized by this instruction and directed by the assignment OPRs shown in table 1. They include:
   A22.4.1. The member may change unit of assignment and/or make a permanent change of station.
   A22.4.2. Most of the moves involve an order directing the PCS.
   A22.4.3. The PCS entitlements members may accrue may be different for each kind of PCS.
   A22.4.4. Because relocation is involved, MPFs assist those agencies directing the PCS and in pro-
   cessing the member for PCS.

                             IC 2003-1 TO AFI 36-2110, ASSIGNMENTS
9 JUNE 2003


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


The changes outlined are incorporated in interim change (IC) 2003-1 (Attachment 23.) The changes
(Table 4.2., rules 9 through 12) exempt members from deployments for six months after returning from
an O/S unaccompanied short tour (Table 4.2., rules 9-12.) This change also increases the waiver authority
from the commander to the MAJCOM/CV and indicates deployment availability code 57 must be updated
by the PRU function (Table 4.2., note 5 and 6). The change to Table 3.9., rules 1 and 2, column B and the
addition of note 3, restates guidance previously documented in AFR 39-11, Airman Assignments. Mem-
bers reporting OS prior to their RNLTD month will have a DEROS established based on their original

note 4. Note 4 references Table 3.14. which provides additional guidance on the match priority within the
short tour returnee category (Table 3.3., note 4) The change to paragraph 2.43. adds a reference, AFI
36-2302, Professional Development (Advanced Academic Degrees and Professional Continuing Educa-
tion). The change to paragraph 2.41.1.1. corrects procedural guidance and the office of responsibility for

2.43. Advance Academic Degree (AAD) Assignment (Officers). This paragraph implements DoD
Directive 1322.10 and AFI 36-2302, Professional Development. Officers who receive advance degrees
(Masters or Doctors of Philosophy [Ph.D.]) through fully funded programs, must be assigned for a mini-
mum of 3 years to a manpower authorization which requires their specific degree and academic discipline
(that is, an AAD position). It is the intent that officers be assigned to an AAD position initially following
graduation. When, for operational reasons, immediate assignment upon graduation to an AAD position is
not possible, a waiver must be requested and approval granted to delay fulfilling the 3 year AAD assign-
ment requirement until the second assignment after graduation. Assignment OPRs, MAJCOMs, and com-
manders are responsible for ensuring proper utilization and assignment of officers who receive AADs.
Therefore, during the 3 year period following graduation, or in instances where a waiver to delay AAD
assignment has been granted, any change in duty position of the officer requires the advance approval of
the assignment OPR. Additionally, HQ AFPC/DPAPE must coordinate on assignments of officers
awarded an AFIT-sponsored AAD. When assignment to an AAD position is not possible as the second
assignment following graduation, then consideration may be given to permanently waiving the require-
ment to serve 3 years in an AAD position. The requirement to serve 3 years in an AAD position is in addi-
tion to an ADSC requirement (see AFI 36-2107, table 1.6), or mandatory utilization requirement (see
paragraph 2.41.). For example, an officer graduates from a Master's degree program sponsored by AFIT
but because of vulnerability for an OS involuntary short tour assignment, the officer is not assigned imme-
diately upon graduation to an AAD position. A waiver must be granted to delay assignment to an AAD
position until the officer completes the OS tour. Upon return from OS, a requirement still exists to assign
the officer to an AAD position for 3 years (even though a portion of the ADSC for the Master's degree has
been served). When upon return from OS, for operational reasons the officer still cannot be assigned to an
AAD position, then a waiver must be granted. As stated above, at this time consideration should be given
to permanently waiving the requirement to be assigned to an AAD position.

NOTES:
1. Use the more restrictive rule if member meets two conditions.
2. When the TDY return date is after the person's DOS or PDD (for PCS) and when necessary to fill short
notice taskings, commanders can still select the person for the TDY providing the TDY orders or amend-
ments reflect the shortened TDY duration and the person returns according to the times in this table.
3. You may assign members to mobility positions upon arrival on station and they may remain against a
mobility position until their departure.
4. Commanders may waive DOS/PCS (Cols D and E) selection minimums. However, review all other
options before committing assigned members on TDY who are separating/retiring or making a PCS.
When waiving minimums, the TDY completion date must not interfere with processing or departure date
for PCS or DOS. Severe problems can occur if a person's DOS expires while TDY.

5. Commanders needing to waive the six-month TOS exemption for operational requirements must obtain
approval from their MAJCOM/CV.
6. Deployment Availability Code (DAV) 57 must be update IAW AFI 10-403 by PRU.

   CONSECUTIVE OS TOUR (COT), IN-PLACE CONSECUTIVE OS TOUR (IPCOT), AND
               INVOLUNTARY CONSECUTIVE OS TOURS (ICOT)


A4.1. COT General Information.
A4.1.1. The objective of the voluntary COT program is twofold: conserve PCS funds by encouraging eli-
gible members to serve consecutive OS tours and reduce PCS turbulence. Since OS returnees must move,
a move from the CONUS to the OS location is eliminated when an OS returnee fills another OS require-
ment. COTs are authorized for any combination of OS assignments (short to long, long to long, etc.).


A4.1.2. All PCS assignments between OS duty stations must be accomplished as COTs except when a
member is reassigned on a continuation of tour due to being surplus (paragraph 2.48.). Do not use the
abbreviation COT in reference to a continuation of tour.
 A4.1.3. Members reassigned on a COT must serve the full prescribed tour at their current location and
must serve the full prescribed tour at the gaining location. Exceptions involving curtailment of current OS
tour and reassignment on a COT may be requested according to paragraph 1.5. and will be considered on
a case by case basis.
A4.1.4. The member’s ODSD and STRD (if applicable) will be updated after completion of the original
tour, plus any approved DEROS extension.
A4.1.5. For COT, no priority travel of dependents or guarantee of government quarters is given over
members being assigned from the CONUS.


A4.2. COT Consideration.
A4.2.1. To receive consideration for a COT, members must be eligible for PCS to include having at least
12 months PCS retainability from current DEROS, and meet COT eligibility requirements, for example,
Table 2.6.
A4.2.2. Officers. Officers volunteer for a COT using the preference worksheet.
A4.2.3. Airmen. Airmen volunteer for a COT by updating OS preferences in the PDS. To ensure these are
viable COT preferences, the OS EQUAL should be used.


A4.3. COT Selection Priorities/Procedures and Retainability Requirements.
A4.3.1. COT volunteers receive assignment consideration according to the priorities in Table 3.3. and
Table 3.4. Intratheater COTs are more economical than intertheater and receive consideration ahead of
intertheater COTs regardless of the order or preference.
A4.3.2. Airmen. Volunteers for COT receive consideration for requirements (reporting) during their
DEROS month plus the following two months (for example, a COT volunteer with a June DEROS will
receive consideration for requirements with reporting during June, July, or August). Airmen with an
380                                                 AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


indefinite DEROS receive continuous consideration for COT provided their DEROS remains indefinite,
they maintain OS preferences in the PDS, they remain eligible for PCS, and they are not within eight
months of their DOS. Once an airman is within eight months of DOS, the DEROS is automatically estab-
lished to equal the DOS and COT consideration stops.
A4.3.2.1. Airmen with an indefinite DEROS selected for a COT will not depart before completing the full
current tour, plus any previously approved DEROS extensions.
A4.3.2.2. Airmen are considered for COT in their CAFSC. Airmen may request consideration in an addi-
tionally awarded AFSC by message to the assignment OPR with information copy to the MAJCOM. Such
a request must be submitted prior to ASD and the needs of the AF determine if selection is approved in
an additional AFSC. Airmen possessing an OS imbalance AFSC will normally be considered only in that
AFSC. However, if a COT cannot be approved in the imbalance AFSC, airmen may be considered in an
additional AFSC. The assignment OPR has final approval/disapproval authority.
A4.3.2.3. Airmen notified of COT approval have 30 calendar days from notification in which to take one
of the following actions as outlined in paragraph 2.29.: obtain the full required retainability for the OS
unaccompanied tour; decline in writing (AF Form 964) to obtain the additional COT retainability or;
request a delay in obtaining the retainability from the MPF Commander. Delays can only be considered
for the reasons provided in Table 2.7.


A4.4. Release From/Cancellation of an Approved COT.
A4.4.1. The requirement to request concurrent travel (CCTVL) still exists when a COT assignment is to
an OS location where CCTVL is not automatic. If for some reason CCTVL cannot be approved for a COT
from one accompanied long tour to another, the MPF reclamas the assignment upon receiving the denial
of CCTVL.
A4.4.2. Officers. See paragraph 2.12.
A4.4.3. Airmen. Airmen may submit a request for release from a COT based on a change of volunteer sta-
tus (this does not delay the requirement for airmen to obtain COT retainability). See paragraph 2.12. This
type request will usually be approved if sufficient lead time exists to select a replacement (150 or more
days from RNLTD). In these requests the MPF uses PDS to reclama the COT assignment. A reclama
request made within 150 days of the RNLTD must be sent by message to the assignment OPR, with infor-
mation copies to the losing and gaining MAJCOMs, and must include full justification for the request.
Such requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis.


A4.5. COT Entitlements (see the JFTR, chapter 7, and AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program).
A4.5.1. Members who will serve a COT, and in certain circumstances their command sponsored depen-
dents, may be entitled to COT travel and transportation allowances as provided in the JFTR, paragraph
U7200. In no instance can these entitlements be used prior to completion of the member’s current tour.
A4.5.2. Leave taken in conjunction with COT travel and transportation entitlements is chargeable leave.


A4.6. IPCOT General Information.
A4.6.1. The objective of the IPCOT program is the same as for COT (see paragraph A4.1.1. above).
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 381


A4.6.2. The IPCOT tour length must be equal to or greater than the tour length currently being served. For
example, a member serving a 36 month accompanied tour may not serve a 24 month (unaccompanied)
IPCOT. EXCEPTIONS: A member serving an accompanied tour who has a change in dependent status
and is no longer accompanied by dependents may request an unaccompanied IPCOT. In addition, airmen
may request a standard tour length IPCOT if currently serving the extended long tour and single officers
with no dependents may request a standard unaccompanied tour length IPCOT if serving the accompanied
equivalent tour length.
A4.6.3. Members serving the unaccompanied tour at a location where an accompanied tour is authorized
may serve an accompanied IPCOT, if desired, provided they have, or are able to obtain, retainability to
serve the full accompanied tour (plus, for airmen, 12 additional months if selected as an extended long
tour volunteer). Member’s must understand that this change of tour is effective on completion of the cur-
rent unaccompanied tour, and any previously approved DEROS extension. The use of entitlements asso-
ciated with the accompanied IPCOT (transportation of dependents, shipment of HHGs, etc.) is not
authorized until completion of the full unaccompanied tour, plus any extensions.
A4.6.4. For members with an established DEROS, the IPCOT is effective on completion of the current
tour, and any previously approved DEROS extension. The IPCOT DEROS is computed by adding the full
length of the tour the member elects to the current DEROS. For members with an indefinite DEROS, the
IPCOT DEROS is effective upon completion of either the initial full prescribed tour, plus any previously
approved DEROS extensions, or upon approval by the HQ AFPC assignment OPR if the original tour,
plus extensions, has been completed.
A4.6.5. The member’s ODSD and STRD (if applicable) will be updated after completion of the original
tour, plus any approved DEROS extension. DAS will not change.
A4.6.6. For IPCOT, no priority travel of dependents or guarantee of government quarters is given over
members being assigned from the CONUS.
A4.6.7. IPCOT approval is based on manning by location, not unit, so the possibility exists that the mem-
ber may be reassigned to another unit or command at the same OS location.


A4.7. IPCOT Consideration.
A4.7.1. To receive consideration for an IPCOT, members must be eligible for PCS to include having at
least 12 months PCS retainability from current DEROS, and meet IPCOT eligibility requirements, for
example, Table 2.6.
A4.7.2. Officers. Officers volunteer for an IPCOT using the assignment worksheet.
A4.7.3. Airmen. Airmen with an established DEROS, or those assigned to long tour locations in Alaska
and Hawaii, request an IPCOT at the time of DEROS forecasting by using the DEROSO RIP. Airmen
with an indefinite DEROS may request an IPCOT at any time through use of PC III at either the CSS or
MPF.
A4.7.4. The unit commander must certify member’s eligibility, including quality control, and recommend
approval or disapproval. Recommending disapproval requires specific reasons, and the request is then
provided to the MSS/CC for consideration. If the MSS/CC concurs with the disapproval recommendation,
the request is returned to the member with no further action taken.
382                                                 AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


A4.8. IPCOT Selection Priorities/Procedures and Retainability Requirements.
A4.8.1. An IPCOT preference is considered ahead of all COT preferences.
A4.8.2. Airmen are considered for IPCOT in their CAFSC. Airmen may request consideration in an addi-
tionally awarded AFSC by message to the assignment OPR with information copy to the MAJCOM. The
needs of the AF determine if selection is approved in an additional AFSC. Airmen possessing an OS
imbalance AFSC will normally be considered only in that AFSC. However, if an IPCOT cannot be
approved in the imbalance AFSC, airmen may be considered in an additional AFSC. The assignment OPR
has final approval/disapproval authority.
A4.8.3. Airmen notified of IPCOT approval have 30 calendar days from notification in which to take one
of the following actions: obtain the full required retainability; decline to obtain the additional IPCOT
retainability (MPFs only need to reclama the IPCOT, do not have the airman complete an AF Form 964),
or request a delay in obtaining the retainability from the MPF Commander. Delays can only be considered
for the reasons provided in Table 2.7.


A4.9. Release From, Cancellation of, or Curtailment of an Approved IPCOT.
A4.9.1. Officers. See paragraph 2.12. In limited cases, if a replacement is available who can meet the
same reporting date, an IPCOT may be canceled by the assignment OPR provided the officer has not
entered it.
A4.9.2. Airmen. Airmen may request release from an IPCOT provided they have not entered into it. If the
cancellation request is approved, the new DEROS will be established as either the original DEROS or 10
months from the date of cancellation, whichever is greater, unless manning supports an earlier DEROS.
An airman must complete at least the initial full prescribed tour, plus any previously approved DEROS
extension. If an airman fails to obtain the required retainability for the IPCOT within 30 calendar days
from approval notification, reclama the assignment but do not have the member complete a PCS declina-
tion statement (AF Form 964).
A4.9.3. While every effort is made to honor the full length of an approved IPCOT, the MPF must advise
members that curtailment and reassignment prior to the IPCOT DEROS may become necessary due to
loss of authorizations, base or unit closure, promotion (only to grades of colonel or CMSgt), and so on.


A4.10. IPCOT Entitlements (see the JFTR, chapter 7, and AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program).
A4.10.1. Members who will serve an IPCOT, and in certain circumstances their command sponsored
dependents, may be entitled to travel and transportation allowances as provided in the JFTR, paragraph
U7200. In no instance can these entitlements be used prior to completion of the member’s current tour.
A4.10.2. Leave taken in conjunction with IPCOT travel and transportation entitlements is chargeable
leave.


A4.11. Involuntary COT (ICOT). Selection of members for ICOTs may be directed by the assignment
OPR, with advance approval of HQ AFPC/DPAPP for lieutenant colonels and below and all airmen, or
AFCMOA for colonels, including selectees, when necessary to satisfy OS requirements. ICOTs will only
be used after less objectionable alternatives have been exhausted. Selection for ICOT is accomplished
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                383


according to the selection order prescribed in Table 3.3. and Table 3.4. Once selected for an ICOT, the
gaining MAJCOM may not change the end assignment without prior approval of the assignment OPR.
384                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


                                               Attachment 24

                       HUMANITARIAN REASSIGNMENT AND DEFERMENT

A24.1. Humanitarian Reassignment/Deferment General Provisions/Policy.
      A24.1.1. Waivers to these provisions require prior approval of HQ AFPC/DPAPO.
      A24.1.2. The Comptroller General has ruled that the move of Air Force members from one place to
      another may not be made at government expense based solely on humanitarian reasons. The determin-
      ing factor in the approval of a request for reassignment is the needs of the Air Force.
      A24.1.3. A request for humanitarian reassignment or deferment is considered based on individual
      merit taking into account the human factors involved, the applicant’s skills and length of service, and
      manning priorities and requirements. A request may be approved when it is clearly in the best interest
      of the Air Force.
      A24.1.4. A request for humanitarian reassignment may warrant giving assignment preference to the
      applicant based on the facts presented. The fact that the move would increase the morale and effec-
      tiveness of the Air Force member may be considered in authorizing PCS in these circumstances, but
      assignment on this fact alone is not authorized.
      A24.1.5. The reassignment or deferment request must be initiated by the member concerned. A
      request initiated/submitted by one person on behalf of another is not accepted.
      A24.1.6. Emergency or ordinary leave is to be used first as a means of easing family hardships or
      problems before applying for humanitarian reassignment.
      A24.1.7. All Air Force personnel must be able to respond to any contingency wherever and whenever
      called upon to do so. The Air Force is also committed to equal distribution of overseas assignments.
      Therefore, permanent or prolonged deferment from reassignment cannot be considered. If a reassign-
      ment or temporary period of deferment is approved, the member must thereafter revert to worldwide
      assignable status.
      A24.1.8. A humanitarian request is approved on its own merit, and will not be disapproved based
      solely on the member’s substandard performance and (or) conduct. Members will only be delayed
      from departing PCS when they are required to remain for completion of investigation and trial by US
      military or civil authorities, administrative actions under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, or
      AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers, or AFI 36-3208,
      Administrative Separation of Airmen. When a reassignment request has been approved and adminis-
      trative separation is not deemed appropriate, the losing commander must formally notify the gaining
      commander, in writing, of any incomplete administrative or disciplinary actions and provide a com-
      prehensive analysis of the member’s job related or personal problems.
      A24.1.9. A humanitarian reassignment or deferment is normally a one-time action to solve a problem
      within a reasonable period of time.
      A24.1.10. For lieutenant colonels and below and all airmen (except those attending initial technical
      training), requests must be submitted via the virtual MPF (vMPF) with supporting documentation to
      the AFPC Contact Center, HQ AFPC/DPFFCC.. Once a request is complete it will be provided for
      consideration to HQ AFPC/DPAPO. Large volume requests may be mailed to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC,
      550 C Street West, Suite B111, Randolph AFB TX 78150. For colonels (including selectees), requests
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                     385


   are submitted to AFSLMO, Crystal Plaza 6 Suite 500, 2221 S. Clark Street, Arlington VA 22202.
   Throughout this attachment when HQ AFPC/DPAPO is referred to, substitute AFSLMO if the appli-
   cant is a colonel or colonel selectee.

A24.2. For the Purpose of Humanitarian Consideration, the Following Terms are Explained.
   A24.2.1. Family Member: Limited to spouse, child, father, mother, father-in-law, mother-in-law,
   stepparent, person in loco parentis, or other persons actually residing in the household who are depen-
   dent for over half of their financial support. While siblings (brothers and sisters of the member or
   spouse) are not within the definition of family member in this attachment, requests involving the ter-
   minal illness of a sibling may be forwarded for consideration as an exception to policy.
   A24.2.2. Person in “Loco Parentis:” A person in loco parentis refers to one who exercised parental
   rights, duties, and responsibilities and, in fact, raised a member or spouse for a minimum of 5 years in
   place of a mother or father because of death of the parent, or in the parent’s continued absence from
   the home before the member’s or spouse’s 21st birthday, or before the member’s entry on active duty,
   whichever is earlier. The relationship must have been such that the member or spouse looked upon the
   person as a parent, not merely as a temporary guardian. The mere presence of a person in the home for
   a number of years, during which time they exercised a degree of custodial, but not parental responsi-
   bility, does not constitute loco parentis. Also, in order for the child to have been in the care and control
   of one acting in place of the parent, the parent cannot have also resided in the same home (unless the
   parent was mentally incompetent).
      A24.2.2.1. A request based on loco parentis status must include affidavits from all parties (to
      include other family members, neighbors, clergy, or family friends) involved stating the details of
      the custody, control, care, and management of the member or his or her spouse. In addition, submit
      copies of any documents that may have been created at the time loco parentis status was estab-
      lished relating to the custody, control, care, and management of the member or spouse (court doc-
      uments, tax returns, report cards signed by the loco parentis “parent,” etc.)

A24.3. Identifying and Reporting Humanitarian Conditions.
   A24.3.1. A member desiring humanitarian deferment must formally submit his or her request to the
   AFPC Contact Center within 30 calendar days from PCS reassignment notification, nomination to HQ
   AFPC or MAJCOM, or selection for TDY in excess of 30 calendar days.
   A24.3.2. Should humanitarian conditions arise after PCS notification or other event notification, the
   member must submit his or her formal request to the AFPC Contact Center for consideration within
   30 calendar days.
   A24.3.3. If a member submits a request for reassignment or deferment and the circumstances change
   prior to a final decision or the member’s departure on assignment, he or she must immediately inform
   either the MPF or the AFPC Contact Center, who in turn notifies HQ AFPC/DPAPO. A message reply
   will be provided with final disposition instructions.

A24.4. Spirit and Intent of the Humanitarian Program.
   A24.4.1. The Humanitarian Program was established to assist members in resolving severe
   short-term problems involving a family member. Members must be effectively utilized in their duty
   (officer) or control (enlisted) AFSC.
386                                                     AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      A24.4.2. When a request involves reassignment, it will normally be to the closest location to where
      the family member concerned resides so the member can provide the family member maximum sup-
      port, consistent with the manning needs of the Air Force. As a general rule, reassignment into a spe-
      cial duty position is not considered since the selection process for such duties can be quite involved
      and often requires an application to the “hiring authority.” Also, retraining into a special duty position
      is not considered based on the lack of training capability.

A24.5. Basic Eligibility Criteria for Humanitarian Reassignment/Deferment. In addition to substan-
tiating a humanitarian problem, the following basic criteria must be met before a request can be approved.
      A24.5.1. A vacancy must exist at the new duty station if a PCS is involved and the member must meet
      service retainability requirements for PCS.
      A24.5.2. The member must be experiencing a problem involving a family member (see paragraphs
      A24.2.1. and A24.2.2.) that is more severe than usually encountered by other Air Force members with
      a similar problem.
      A24.5.3. The member’s presence must be absolutely essential to alleviate the problem.
      A24.5.4. The problem can be resolved within a reasonable period of time (normally 12 months).

A24.6. Humanitarian Conditions Usually Warranting Approval. It is impractical to try to list all the
conditions for which a humanitarian reassignment or deferment may be approved. The factors to be con-
sidered vary from case to case and the number of possible situations and circumstances are almost infi-
nite. However, requests substantiating problems arising from any of the following circumstances usually
warrant approval:
      A24.6.1. The recent death (within 12 months) of the member’s spouse or child, including miscar-
      riages of 20 weeks or more gestation. Humanitarian reassignment is normally approved on the death
      of a child or stepchild under the age of 18 who is living in the member’s home at the time of death. A
      request based on a child or stepchild who is over the age of 18 will be considered on a case-by-case
      basis. Reassignment made under this provision will normally be considered to only one of two loca-
      tions -- either near extended family for support or to the closest available base to the burial site. The
      overall consideration will be the needs of the Air Force and retraining is not usually considered in this
      type request; however, every effort will be made to ensure the member is provided an assignment as
      close to the area of support as possible.
      A24.6.2. The member has a serious financial problem not the result of overextension of personal mil-
      itary income (such as loss of primary home of residence where member or spouse and children cur-
      rently reside, or loss of possessions through fire, theft, or natural disaster), and the member will suffer
      a substantial financial loss unless his or her presence or continued presence can be ensured. It must be
      shown that the problem cannot be resolved by leave, correspondence, power of attorney, or by any
      other person or means.
      A24.6.3. The member is serving an unaccompanied OS tour and his or her spouse abandons their
      children. It must be shown it is not possible for the children to join the member at the OS location
      when an accompanied tour is authorized and that the member’s presence is necessary. The assignment
      location under this provision will be based on the needs of the Air Force.
      A24.6.4. The terminal illness of a family member (see paragraph A24.2.1. and A24.2.2. for definition
      of family members for the purpose of humanitarian reassignment) when death is imminent within 2
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 387


   years. A doctor's prognosis of a terminal illness must be fully supported and substantiated by clinical
   data. In such cases, the member’s presence is considered essential regardless of the availability of
   other family members to assist.
   A24.6.5. An authorized state or local agency places a child in the member’s home and deferment is
   necessary to comply with state or local laws to complete final adoption. Reassignment to pursue adop-
   tion is not normally authorized.
   A24.6.6. Reassignment or deferment is essential in establishing or operating an effective family
   advocacy program according to AFI 40-301, Family Advocacy. Documentation from the base Family
   Advocacy Officer is required. NOTE: While requests for humanitarian consideration must be initiated
   by the member, there are some instances involving family advocacy issues where the member does
   not desire assignment or assignment cancellation and there are no quality control factors that would
   support such action. In these situations, the member’s commander can request assignment or assign-
   ment cancellation via humanitarian deferment when the basis is to continue or obtain treatment for
   family advocacy issues. The request must be fully documented and endorsed by the local Family
   Advocacy Officer (see paragraph 3.8.10.2. for personnel assigned overseas).
   A24.6.7. Sexual abuse and/or assault of the member’s spouse or child when it has been determined
   and fully substantiated by appropriate medical authority that remaining in the area where the incident
   occurred would be detrimental to the health of the family member. While the applicant may request a
   specific base for reassignment, manning must fully support as the main consideration is to relocate
   away from where the incident occurred. Retraining is not usually considered for this type request.

A24.7. Reasons Humanitarian Requests are Usually Disapproved. Requests for reassignment or
deferment are usually disapproved when it is probable that the problem will exist for an indefinite period
of time, or the request is based on one of the following circumstances:
   A24.7.1. A desire to provide emotional or domiciliary support to a parent or parent-in-law due to age,
   non-terminal or chronic illness or disability, or recent death in the family.
   A24.7.2. Problems associated with child care arrangements, or a single parent’s desire to make or
   facilitate either short or long term child care arrangements.
   A24.7.3. Psychoneurosis (such as various psychic or mental disorders characterized by special com-
   binations of anxieties, compulsions, obsessions, phobias, and motor or sensory manifestations) result-
   ing from family separation incident to military assignment.
   A24.7.4. Normal pregnancy, threatened miscarriage, breech birth, Cesarean section, or RH incompat-
   ibility.
   A24.7.5. The existence of a housing shortage or home ownership problems.
   A24.7.6. A financial problem, to include bankruptcy, resulting from over-extension of military
   income.
   A24.7.7. A financial or management problem related to off-duty employment, the spouse’s employ-
   ment, private business activities, or to settle an estate.
   A24.7.8. Passport or visa problems involving newly acquired family members.
   A24.7.9. Threatened separation, divorce action, or the desire to pursue child custody.
388                                                 AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      A24.7.10. The problem existed or was reasonably foreseeable at the time of latest entry on active
      duty without a break in service, or prior to departure on PCS.
      A24.7.11. For the purpose of seeking or providing family support except as outlined in paragraphs
      A24.6.1. or A24.6.4.
      A24.7.12. A consecutive PCS or deferment based on continuation of the same circumstances (does
      not include a request to extend a current deferment--see paragraph A24.11.).
      A24.7.13. A request based on the medical condition of the Air Force member. (Assignment for this
      reason is initiated by local medical authorities when it is determined the situation warrants such
      action.)
      A24.7.14. Requests for deferment will not be considered for members who have not been selected
      and notified of reassignment or TDY in excess of 30 days. A deferment request can be considered
      based on the member’s appearance on the Vulnerable Mover List (VML) if coordination with the
      appropriate assignment officer confirms assignment selection is highly likely.

A24.8. Processing Humanitarian Requests.
      A24.8.1. The final approval/disapproval authority is HQ AFPC/DPAPO. A request cannot be
      approved or denied at a lower level.
      A24.8.2. The applicant submits the request through the AFPC Contact Center via the vMPF. All
      required information according to Figure A24.1., plus supporting documentation, is necessary or the
      request cannot be processed.
         A24.8.2.1. A member desiring humanitarian reassignment who also has a spouse or child(ren)
         enrolled in the EFMP must include appropriate medical or educational documentation concerning
         the EFMP situation with the humanitarian request (DD Form 2792, plus addendums). A humani-
         tarian reassignment cannot be approved unless the projected assignment location can meet the
         needs of the exceptional family member.
         A24.8.2.2. Once the Contact Center receives the complete request, to include supporting docu-
         mentation, from the member, it must be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAPO within 1 workday.
      A24.8.3. Forwarding endorsements and correspondence must include:
         A24.8.3.1. Recommendation by commander to include additional information or evidence of
         material value. If the commander recommends disapproval, complete justification must be pro-
         vided. The commander's recommendation requirement is waived if the situation precludes the
         member from reasonably obtaining it (request submitted while on leave, TDY, etc.). When appli-
         cable, the request must include the reason for omitting the commander's recommendation.
         A24.8.3.2. Both members of a military couple must submit a request if the same assignment con-
         sideration is desired. When both apply, respective commander endorsements are required.

A24.9. Available Options When a Request is Disapproved. When a request is disapproved the MPF
must counsel the member on the following options: Members may apply (if eligible) for retirement, retire-
ment under hardship conditions, hardship discharge, or (for officers) resignation or release from active
duty. For those who are pending reassignment a request under this paragraph must be submitted within 7
calendar days following receipt of the correspondence disapproving the request.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  389


A24.10. Withdrawing a Request. If a member wants to withdraw his or her request before a final deci-
sion or departure on reassignment, the request must be submitted in writing to either the MPF or the
AFPC Contact Center, who in turn notifies HQ AFPC/DPAPO immediately. Once a member has departed
on a humanitarian reassignment, the request can no longer be withdrawn.

A24.11. Humanitarian Assignment/TDY Restrictions.
   A24.11.1. The TDY assignment authority will not select a member for TDY exceeding 30 calendar
   days while in humanitarian deferment (AAC 30, Table 2.1.). If provided a humanitarian reassign-
   ment, members will not be reassigned PCS for at least 12 months from date arrived station. A defer-
   ment will initially restrict members from PCS or TDY for a maximum of 12 months. The initial period
   of assignment/TDY restriction for humanitarian reasons may be extended at the member’s request
   provided the total period does not exceed 18 months. If a terminal illness is involved, deferment may
   be extended up to a total of 24 months. Requests for such extensions are submitted using Figure
   A24.1. and must substantiate that:
       A24.11.1.1. Every possible effort has been made to overcome the problem.
       A24.11.1.2. The condition warranting assignment/TDY restriction still exists.
       A24.11.1.3. The problem can be resolved within the extended period of assignment/TDY restric-
       tion.
   A24.11.2. If a member’s parent organization is relocated or deactivated before expiration of the
   assignment restriction, he or she is reported to the MAJCOM for intracommand reassignment to
   another organization on the same base. If no authorization for their specialty exists on base, or if the
   base is being deactivated, the MAJCOM requests reassignment instructions from HQ AFPC/DPAPO.

A24.12. Applicant Responsibilities.
   A24.12.1. Emergency or ordinary leave must be used first as a means of resolving the problem.
   A24.12.2. Submits the request through the AFPC Contact Center via the vMPF and faxes all required
   endorsements and supporting documentation to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC. Large volume requests may be
   mailed to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC, 550 C Street West, Suite B111, Randolph AFB TX 78150.
   A24.12.3. A member stationed OS and requesting reassignment OS must agree to serve the pre-
   scribed tour length at the new location or at least a tour length equal to the combined unaccompanied
   tour lengths at the old and new locations, whichever is greater. FOR EXAMPLE, if you are serving on
   a 30/18 month OS tour and receive approval for reassignment to a 36/24 month OS tour, you must
   serve the full prescribed tour at the gaining location (36 months), or not less than a tour equal to the
   combined unaccompanied tour lengths (18 plus 24, or 42 months) between the two OS locations
   before reassignment from the theater, whichever is greater. The computation resulting in the greatest
   combined OS tour period being served is the required minimum. The variable is the amount of time
   you have been assigned to the current location.
   A24.12.4. For members enroute PCS, they may discuss the problem with the nearest MPF com-
   mander, the AFPC Contact Center, or AFPC/DPAPO personnel to assist in deciding whether or not to
   submit a request. There is no reimbursement authorized if the member decides to travel to the nearest
   base with an MPF and a member's status remains unchanged (for example, leave) if they decide to
   submit a request. The member must comply with current reporting instructions if the assignment
390                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      authority denies suspension of movement; however, a request still can be submitted (see paragraph
      A24.15.6.).
      A24.12.5. If a request for assignment is to a dependent-restricted area and the member’s foreign-born
      spouse will be traveling to the native country, such information must be included in the humanitarian
      request. If reassignment is approved, a request for a designated location move (DLM) to the native
      country must be processed per AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel.
      A24.12.6. If the circumstances of the situation change and the request is still pending, the AFPC Con-
      tact Center must be notified immediately. An approved humanitarian reassignment is normally can-
      celed if the situation for which granted ceases to exist before the member’s departure. In this instance
      the member must include in the notification to the AFPC Contact Center information and supporting
      documentation to show what actions have been taken regarding the reassignment. The AFPC Contact
      Center provides this information to HQ AFPC/DPAPO who will make the final decision and provide
      a response by message.
      A24.12.7. Once a request has been approved the member must notify the MPF when the situation
      upon which approval was granted ceases to exist. Once notified the MPF deletes AAC 30 and the
      accompanying deployment availability code.

A24.13. AFPC Contact Center Responsibilities.
      A24.13.1. Counsels members desiring to submit a request for reassignment/deferment on humanitar-
      ian provisions.
      A24.13.2. Ensures the member’s request has all pertinent documentation as outlined in figure A7.1
      and this attachment.
      A24.13.3. Processes and forwards to HQ AFPC/DPAPO complete requests within 1 workday after
      receipt from the member. Reasons for exceeding this standard must be explained/provided in the for-
      warding correspondence.
      A24.13.4. Acts as liaison between HQ AFPC/DPAPO and the applicant.
      A24.13.5. Using MilPDS updates the AAC and DOA as directed by HQ AFPC/DPAPO.

A24.14. Commander Responsibilities.
      A24.14.1. Recommends approval/disapproval of the humanitarian request and includes any informa-
      tion that helps HQ AFPC make a decision. All disapproval recommendations must be fully justified.
      A24.14.2. Does not select members assigned or deferred for humanitarian reasons for TDY in excess
      of 30 calendar days while they are in AAC 30.
      A24.14.3. When the criteria for immediate reassignment are met (for example, death of a dependent
      child), commanders will ensure appropriate officials (e.g., medical, legal, OSI, etc.) are aware of the
      member’s reassignment request and the probability of approval and immediate departure on PCS.

A24.15. MPF Responsibilities.
      A24.15.1. Processes requests for delay in reporting when applicant’s projected departure date is
      within 30 days.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                              391


  A24.15.2. Assists the member with accessing the vMPF applications. Processes requests submitted
  by initial technical training students.
  A24.15.3. Sends a message providing full facts and circumstances to AFPC/DPAPO when the reason
  for the request ceases to exist before the applicant departs PCS.
  A24.15.4. Counsels the applicant on other available options if the approval authority disapproves the
  request. See paragraph A24.9.
  A24.15.5. Deletes an AAC or deployment restriction when appropriate. The member must inform the
  MPF when the circumstances on which a request was approved ceases to exist and the MPF deletes
  the restriction or AAC.
  A24.15.6. When a member is PCS enroute to or from an OS area, or is TDY in the CONUS from OS,
  the MPF commander may be contacted for assistance by phone or mail. There is no reimbursement
  authorized if the member decides to travel to the nearest base with an MPF. A member's status remains
  unchanged (for example, leave) if he or she decides to submit a request. The MPF commander will
  assist the member in submission of a formal request for humanitarian reassignment or deferment. The
  MPF commander may request to suspend the movement of the member; however, members must be
  advised that their status remains unchanged (for example, leave) if the request for suspension is
  granted while a request is pending. These requests must be forwarded by message to HQ AFPC/
  DPAPO with information copies to the losing and gaining activity and include:
     A24.15.6.1. The member’s name, grade, SSN, SAFSC (officers) or CAFSC (airmen), port call
     date (if applicable), date of humanitarian submission (if any), date departed losing organization,
     losing and gaining unit of assignment, and RNLTD.
     A24.15.6.2. A brief summary of the situation and any relevant supporting information.
     A24.15.6.3. Counsels the member on the provisions of AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, if
     the member has an advance (negative) leave balance when suspending movement or when submit-
     ting the request. NOTE: The time between the request submission and the approval authority’s
     final action is considered leave.
     A24.15.6.4. If the request for suspension of movement is denied, the member may still elect to
     submit a humanitarian request but also must comply with the current reporting instructions.
     Requests for a new port call date or a change in RNLTD will not be submitted after denial of the
     request for suspension of movement.

MEMORANDUM FOR UNIT COMMANDER/SQUADRON SECTION COMMANDER (Date)
HQ AFPC/DPAPO
IN TURN
FROM: (Functional Address Symbol)
SUBJ: Humanitarian (Reassignment) (Deferment)
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU FULLY DOCUMENT AND SUBSTANTIATE YOUR REQUEST.

from reassignment or TDY to)__________________ _________for the following reasons: (Give all
relevant information to support your request. SEE NOTES).
2. I have taken the following actions or steps to resolve the situation: (Note: Information concerning the
existence of a viable family care plan according to AFI 36-2908 must be included in this paragraph if the
request is based on a spouse’s medical or emotional problems that make his or her ability to manage the
household questionable in your absence. Information addressing why a care plan was not established or
why an existing one is no longer viable is required.)
3. I submit the following supporting information:
   a. Organization and location (current and projected), E-mail address, fax phone number, and phone
   number where you can reach me:
   b. Home address of family member concerned:
   c. Current leave address, date leave expires, leave telephone number, and E-mail address:
4. I have (not) been previously (reassigned) (deferred from reassignment) for humanitarian reasons. If so,
indicate date and reason.
5. My spouse and I have the following family members, but they cannot assist for the reasons indicated.
(Give a complete composition of your and your spouse's family, their locations, and specific reasons why
they are unable to assist.)
6. (If en route PCS, indicate the specific reasons why you did not submit the request before departing
your last duty station.)
7. (If currently assigned OS and request is for another OS location.) If reassigned to another OS location
within the same theater, I do (not) volunteer to serve either the full accompanied tour length at the gaining
location, or at least a tour length equal to the combined unaccompanied tour lengths specified for the
losing and gaining locations, whichever is greater.
8. I do/do not have an active duty spouse. If so, I understand he/she must either submit a separate request
or sign this request. In either case, an endorsement from both commanders is required. I understand that
my spouse will not receive assignment/ deferment consideration without the appropriate endorsements
and signatures.

9. I will (not) accept voluntary retraining (if necessary) for approval of my request. I understand I will
incur an assignment restriction due to my retraining. I also understand future assignment or utilization in
a previously held specialty will depend on Air Force manning requirements and that I may have to remain
in the retraining AFSC for an indefinite period.
10. I understand if changes occur to the situation presented, whether prior to a final decision, my
departure, or after approval, I must advise either the Military Personnel Flight or Contact Center
immediately.

Figure A24.2. Sample Request for Medical Data (Humanitarian).


(Appropriate Letterhead)
Dear Doctor:                                                                           (Date)
  I would appreciate, as soon as possible, a medical statement in support of my request for humanitarian
  reassignment or deferment based on my ________________ medical condition. Air Force physicians
  at the headquarters will review this medical statement and it will be the basis for the medical
  recommendation. Please cover in your statement at least the following in professional terminology:
   a. Diagnosis.
   b. Brief history of illness, including when initially diagnosed.
   c. Status of present condition with description of degree of disability.
   d. Prognosis. (Resolution of the medical problem by some means within 12 to 18 months is a key
   factor.) Fully substantiate and support the prognosis of terminal illness (within 2 years) by clinical
   data.
   e. Therapy, current and contemplated.
   f. If applicable, confirm the hospital or institution can accept the patient.
  g. Your evaluation of the affect of the presence or absence of the applicant on the medical problem. If
   you desire you can seal sensitive information in a separate envelope marked "Sensitive Medical
   Data--For Medical Personnel Only."
   Thank you for your assistance.
                                                           Sincerely,

                   EXCEPTIONAL FAMILY MEMBER PROGRAM (EFMP)

A25.1. EFMP Reassignment/Deferment General Provisions/Policy.
   A25.1.1. Waivers to these provisions require prior approval of HQ AFPC/DPAPO.
   A25.1.2. All Air Force personnel must be able to respond to any contingency wherever and whenever
   called upon to do so. The Air Force is also committed to equal distribution of overseas assignments.
   As a result, permanent or prolonged deferment from reassignment cannot be considered. If a reassign-
   ment or temporary period of deferment is approved, the member must thereafter revert to worldwide
   assignable status.
   A25.1.3. The reassignment or deferment request must be initiated by the member concerned. A
   request initiated/submitted by one person on behalf of another is not accepted.
   A25.1.4. An EFMP request is approved on its own merit, and will not be disapproved based solely on
   the member’s substandard performance and (or) conduct. Members will only be delayed from depart-
   ing PCS when they are required to remain for completion of investigation and trial by US military or
   civil authorities or administrative actions under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, or AFI
   36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers, or AFI 36-3208, Adminis-
   trative Separation of Airmen. When a reassignment request has been approved and administrative sep-
   aration is not deemed appropriate, the losing commander must formally notify the gaining
   commander, in writing, of any incomplete administrative or disciplinary actions and provide a com-
   prehensive analysis of the member’s job related or personal problems.
   A25.1.5. For lieutenant colonels and below and all airmen (except those attending initial technical
   training), requests must be submitted via the virtual MPF (vMPF) with supporting documentation to
   the AFPC Contact Center, HQ AFPC/DPFFCC. Once a request is complete it will be provided for
   consideration to HQ AFPC/DPAPO. Large volume requests may be mailed to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC,
   550 C Street West, Suite B111, Randolph AFB TX 78150. For colonels (including selectees), requests
   are submitted to AFSLMO, Crystal Plaza 6 Suite 500, 2221 S. Clark Street, Arlington VA 22202.
   Throughout this attachment when HQ AFPC/DPAPO is referred to, substitute AFSLMO if the appli-
   cant is a colonel or colonel selectee.

A25.2. For the Purpose of the EFMP, the Following Terms are Explained.
   A25.2.1. Exceptional Family Member: Limited to the member’s spouse, child, or other person actu-
   ally residing in the member’s household who is dependent on the member for over half of his or her
   financial support, and who meets DoD criteria for enrollment in the EFMP.
   A25.2.2. Special Needs Coordinator (SNC): A medical officer assigned to the medical treatment
   facility (MTF) who is appointed as the SNC by the MTF Commander.
      A25.2.2.1. Family Member Relocation Clearance (FMRC) Coordinator: A medical technician or
      civilian assigned to the MTF who is appointed as the FMRC Coordinator by the MTF Com-
      mander.
396                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      A25.2.3. General Medical Services (GMS): Encompasses all types of physiological, psychological,
      or social conditions of a chronic nature that have been medically diagnosed and that require special-
      ized treatment.
      A25.2.4. Special Educational Services (SES): Specially designed instruction to meet the unique edu-
      cational needs of a handicapped child, including education provided in school, at home, in a hospital
      or in an institution, physical education programs, and vocational educational programs.
      A25.2.5. Early Intervention (EI) and/or Related Services (RS): DoDI 1342.12, Provision of Early
      Intervention and Special Education Services to Eligible DoD Dependents, provides guidance for EI
      and RS. Transportation and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as required
      to assist a child, from birth to 21 years, inclusive, with a disability to benefit from special education
      under the child's Individualized Family Service Plan or Individualized Education Plan. EI and RS can
      include speech-language pathology and audiology, psychological services, physical and occupational
      therapy, recreation including therapeutic recreation, early identification and assessment of disabilities
      in children, counseling services including rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility services,
      and medical services for diagnostic or evaluative purposes. Special Education Services can also
      include: school health services, social work services, parent counseling and training. The sources for
      these services are the home or community (natural setting), school (least restrictive environment), and
      medical treatment facilities.
      A25.2.6. Structural Accessibility: Encompasses design modification and enhancements that permit
      safe access to or from military housing in accordance with the provisions of the Architectural Barriers
      Act of 1968 (42 USC, 4151). The immediate nonavailability of structural accessibility requirements at
      a projected location will not be a limiting factor for assignment purposes.

A25.3. Identifying and Reporting EFMP Conditions.
      A25.3.1. Enrollment in the EFMP is mandatory and requires the identification of all family members
      requiring long term general medical, special educational, early intervention (EI) and/or related ser-
      vices (RS), or modified housing. Members with family members who require general medical, special
      educational, EI and/or RS, or modified housing must contact the Special Needs Coordinator in the
      MTF for a complete evaluation, assessment, and possible enrollment. Likewise, the Special Needs
      Coordinator must be advised immediately following the identification of a family member who has a
      long term condition requiring general medical, special educational, EI or RS, or modified housing.
      The Air Force is committed to meeting the needs of this unique segment of our Air Force community
      and must be informed of the special needs of our members’ families.
      A25.3.2. A member desiring EFMP deferment must formally submit his or her request to the AFPC
      Contact Center within 30 calendar days from PCS reassignment notification or nomination to HQ
      AFPC or MAJCOM.
      A25.3.3. Should EFMP conditions arise after PCS notification or other event notification, the mem-
      ber must report them to the Special Needs Coordinator and MPF immediately. If appropriate, the
      member must submit his or her formal request to the AFPC Contact Center for consideration within
      30 calendar days.
      A25.3.4. If a member submits a request for reassignment or deferment and the circumstances change
      prior to a final decision or the member’s departure on assignment, he or she must immediately inform
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    397


   either the MPF or the AFPC Contact Center, who in turn notifies HQ AFPC/DPAPO. A message reply
   will be provided with final disposition instructions.

A25.4. Spirit and Intent of the EFMP.
   A25.4.1. EFMP actions are designed to help an Air Force member who has a family member with
   special needs that meet DoD enrollment criteria. These problems are usually permanent or long term,
   and the family may need continued assistance. A member may need EFMP assignment consideration
   throughout an entire Air Force career.
   A25.4.2. The EFMP is distinct from humanitarian policy and is based on the personnel (manning)
   requirements of the Air Force. The two programs are not interchangeable and the EFMP should not be
   interpreted as a base of choice program. The intent of the EFMP assignment policy is to use the Air
   Force member, based on current or projected manning requirements, at locations where required med-
   ical, educational, early intervention, or related services are available either through the military medi-
   cal system, through civilian resources utilizing TRICARE, or a combination thereof and local
   resources. HQ AFPC/DPAPO, in coordination with the AFPC Medical Staff, assignment OPR, and
   base level Special Needs Coordinator, determines a suitable assignment.
   A25.4.3. The EFMP provides an initial 12-month deferment for a newly diagnosed condition when
   the member’s presence is essential in establishing and/or participating in the treatment program.
   Deferment from reassignment may also be appropriate if a treatment program is at a critical juncture
   and the member’s continued presence is absolutely essential to continuing the treatment program. The
   EFMP also provides reassignment when a member is assigned to an area and a new medical, special
   education, related service, or early intervention need arises for which the needed services are not
   available within the assignment locale. Once a treatment program is established, whether formally
   through the EFMP or on the member’s own initiative, the member is then considered worldwide
   assignable.
   A25.4.4. Enrolling a family member in the EFMP does not negate the member’s responsibility to
   serve his or her share of overseas duty, or in meeting deployment requirements.

A25.5. Basic Eligibility Criteria for EFMP Reassignment/Deferment. Members may be provided an
EFMP reassignment or deferment if:
   A25.5.1. The member has a family member with a medical or educational requirement that meets the
   DoD criteria for enrollment in the EFMP (Assignment Limitation Code “Q” in the MilPDS).
   A25.5.2. The Special Needs Coordinator has determined that adequate facilities/resources to meet the
   family member’s medical, educational, related service, or early intervention requirements do not exist
   and cannot be reasonably provided within the current assignment locale.
   A25.5.3. The member’s presence is determined to be essential in establishing, participating in, or
   continuing a medical regimen or educational program in the present area of assignment. Normally,
   only one deferment for the continuing condition of the same family member is permitted and a TDY
   deferment (when determined necessary) is normally only provided during the initial assignment defer-
   ment period.
   A25.5.4. The member was denied family member travel by the gaining MTF based on processing the
   AF Form 1466 and other documentation. A facility determination inquiry must be completed to the
   gaining location and a copy of the denial document must accompany the EFMP request. Deferment is
398                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      not normally granted for this situation; however, cancellation of assignment may be provided or, if the
      member is in a mandatory move status (see Attachment 1), an alternate assignment provided. The
      abbreviated EFMP application reflected in Figure A25.2. should be used.

A25.6. Assignment Considerations for Members with Exceptional Family Members. Requests for
EFMP consideration are submitted in the following circumstances:
      A25.6.1. The member was denied family member travel (members projected to PCS CONUS to
      CONUS or overseas (OS) to CONUS) by the gaining MTF based on processing the AF Form 1466
      and other documentation. A facility determination inquiry must be completed to the gaining location
      and a copy of the denial document must accompany the request. Deferment is not normally granted
      for this situation; however, cancellation of assignment is provided or, if the member is in a mandatory
      move status, an alternate assignment provided. Use the appropriate abbreviated EFMP application
      reflected in Figure A25.2. and provide the documentation concerning the denied family member
      travel (AF Form 1466, DD Form 2792, etc., that identify the needed resources), and any other docu-
      ments that were used in the initial family member clearance process.
      A25.6.2. If serving OS accompanied by command sponsored family members, a member may
      request reassignment within the OS theater if an unforeseen medical or educational requirement arises
      after arrival at the OS base. For an EFMP reassignment within the same OS theater, the member must
      agree to serve the full prescribed OS tour length at the gaining location or at least a tour equal to the
      combined unaccompanied tour lengths, whichever is greater, prior to being reassigned from the the-
      ater. For example, if serving on a 30/18 month OS tour and approval is received for assignment to a
      36/24 month OS tour, the member must serve the full prescribed tour at the gaining location (36
      months), or not less than a tour equal to the combined unaccompanied tour lengths (18 plus 24, or 42
      months) between the two OS locations before reassignment from the theater, whichever is greater. The
      computation resulting in the greatest combined OS tour period being served is the required minimum.
      The variable is the amount of time the member has been assigned to the current location.
      A25.6.3. If serving OS accompanied by command sponsored family members, a member may
      request reassignment to the CONUS before DEROS if an unforeseen medical or educational require-
      ment arises after arrival at the OS base and reassignment under paragraph A25.6.2. is impractical. If
      the reassignment request is based on inadequate medical or educational resources, the request must
      include the AF Form 1466 and the document, if other than the AF Form 1466, that approved family
      member travel to the present location. NOTE: If the member caused or contributed to the commission
      of an AF Form 1466 violation, either by falsifying or omitting information which led to the approval
      of family member travel, unless the member’s presence is absolutely essential for treatment, the fam-
      ily member should be returned to the CONUS and the member will be required to complete the
      remainder of the OS tour established by the original tour election.
      A25.6.4. If selected for an OS long tour regardless of volunteer status, and family member travel is
      disapproved based on the unavailability of early intervention or related services and/or special educa-
      tional services, (see paragraph A25.2.) the member may seek release from the assignment. To do this,
      the member must submit the appropriate abbreviated EFMP application reflected in Figure A25.2. to
      the AFPC Contact Center within 7 calendar days of receipt of the disapproval of family member
      travel. A copy of the AF Form 1466, MAJCOM/SG determination, and other supporting documenta-
      tion disapproving family member travel must be included as attachments to the request for assignment
      cancellation. However, if a pinpointed assignment (a location with the required services) is identified
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                399


   by the MAJCOM/SG, and a manning requirement exists at that location, a member selected as the
   most eligible nonvolunteer will be required to proceed to the pinpointed assignment.
   A25.6.5. If selected for an OS long tour as a nonvolunteer and family member travel is disapproved
   based on the unavailability of general medical services (see paragraph A25.2.), a member may volun-
   teer through the AFPC Contact Center for an unaccompanied short tour in an effort to minimize fam-
   ily separation. Use the appropriate abbreviated EFMP application reflected in Figure A25.2. If there
   are no current or projected short tour requirements available, the unaccompanied long tour length
   must be served at the projected OS location. After arrival OS, the existing condition will not be con-
   sidered in support of a curtailment and early return to the CONUS unless the condition significantly
   worsens and the member’s presence is considered essential.
   A25.6.6. If selected as a volunteer for an OS long tour and family member travel is disapproved
   based on the unavailability of general medical services, (see paragraph A25.2.) a member may request
   cancellation of the assignment through the AFPC Contact Center. Use the appropriate abbreviated
   EFMP application reflected in Figure A25.2. The request must include the documentation that denied
   family member travel. Although approval of the request is not automatic, every effort will be made
   and consideration given to approve such requests consistent with the needs of the Air Force.
   A25.6.7. If selected as a nonvolunteer for an OS short tour to an area where family members are
   authorized (for example, Guam, Azores, etc.), a member is required to serve the unaccompanied tour
   length when family member OS travel is denied, regardless of the reason.
   A25.6.8. If selected for an OS unaccompanied short tour (15 months or less), members may and are
   encouraged to apply for a home-basing assignment (Attachment 5) to effect continuation of the
   established EFMP. The request for home-basing should include trailer remarks that state the member
   is applying to effect continuation of an established EFMP. Those not selected for home-basing assign-
   ment may request EFMP reassignment through the AFPC Contact Center to the same location as an
   OS returnee for continuation of the established EFMP. Such a request must be submitted no earlier
   than the 10th month and no later than the 8th month before DEROS.

A25.7. Reasons EFMP Requests are Usually Disapproved. HQ AFPC/DPAPO will not usually
approve requests for reassignment/deferment under the following circumstances:
   A25.7.1. If the member caused or contributed to the commission of an AF Form 1466 violation,
   either by falsifying or omitting information which led to the approval of family member travel. Unless
   the member’s presence is absolutely essential, the family member should be returned to the CONUS
   and the member must complete the OS tour length prescribed based on his or her status.
      A25.7.1.1. Reassignment when the member initially elects and proceeds on the unaccompanied
      all-others overseas tour at a location where family members are allowed and then, after arrival,
      desires to change to an accompanied tour and the required medical or educational resources are
      not available to meet his family member’s previously identified special needs.
      A25.7.1.2. Reassignment when the member circumvents or disregards the family member clear-
      ance process by bringing noncommand sponsored family members, at personal expense, to an
      overseas location where the required medical resources do not exist to meet their known needs.
   A25.7.2. Reassignment in order to establish a treatment program based on the availability of a pre-
   ferred or optimal program in an area other than where currently assigned when adequate facilities or
   services can be, or are, provided within the current locale. Also, EFMP deferments are not granted for
400                                                     AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


      family members to remain in a preferred or optimal program when adequate services are available
      within the projected assignment locale.
      A25.7.3. Reassignment for the purpose of obtaining extended family support.
      A25.7.4. Reassignment based on the availability of a free or lower cost program in an area other than
      where currently assigned when the current duty location can provide adequate services on base or
      through the local community. EXCEPTION: When required services are being received off base and
      are causing a significant financial hardship, a member can apply for reassignment as an exception to
      policy. Documentation provided with such a request must clearly document the hardship. This provi-
      sion does not apply to a dependent parent/parent-in-law since they are not eligible for coverage under
      Tricare (see A25.7.11.).
      A25.7.5. Reassignment based on the climatic conditions or geographical area adversely affecting a
      family member’s health, and the problem is of a recurring nature (such as asthma, allergies, eczema,
      etc.). EXCEPTION: Reassignment as an exception to policy can be requested if the continued pres-
      ence of the family member in such a climate/environment is medically determined to be clearly life
      threatening.
      A25.7.6. The request is based on mental disorders (for example, anxieties, compulsions, obsessions,
      phobias, and motor or sensory manifestations or combinations thereof) resulting from family separa-
      tion incident to military assignment.
      A25.7.7. A request based on an intellectually or athletically gifted child. Intellectually or athletically
      gifted children do not qualify under the provisions of Public Law 95-561, Defense Dependents’ Edu-
      cation Act of 1978, DoD instructions, and EFMP procedures.
      A25.7.8. The family member is in an institution, unless institution officials certify frequent and regu-
      lar visits will be medically beneficial to the family member, or if admittance to or retention in the
      institution requires establishing, continuing, or renewing state residency.
      A25.7.9. The disability is due to a short-term illness or injury, or when the prognosis for complete
      recovery is satisfactory without the benefit of reassignment or deferment.
      A25.7.10. Reassignment from the CONUS to OS for the sole purpose of establishing a treatment pro-
      gram.
      A25.7.11. A request for reassignment to a location with a greater capability to provide space available
      care in a MTF for a member with a dependent parent/parent-in-law when the required care is available
      within the current assignment locale.
      A25.7.12. A request based on the medical condition of the Air Force member. (Assignment for this
      reason is initiated by local medical authorities when it is determined the situation warrants such
      action.)
      A25.7.13. Requests for deferment will not be considered for members who have not been selected
      and notified of reassignment or TDY in excess of 30 days. A deferment request can be considered
      based on the member’s appearance on the Vulnerable Mover List (VML) if coordination with the
      appropriate assignment officer confirms assignment selection is highly likely.
      A25.7.14. Deferment from reassignment when the required resources are available within the pro-
      jected assignment locale.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                401


A25.8. Processing EFMP Requests.
   A25.8.1. The final approval/disapproval authority is HQ AFPC/DPAPO. A request cannot be
   approved or denied at a lower level.
   A25.8.2. Submits the request through the AFPC Contact Center via the vMPF and faxes all required
   endorsements and supporting documentation to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC. Large volume requests can be
   mailed to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC, 550 C Street West, Suite B111, Randolph AFB TX 78150.
       A25.8.2.1. Once the Contact Center receives the complete request, to include supporting docu-
       mentation, from the member, it must be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAPO within 1 workday.
   A25.8.3. Forwarding endorsements and correspondence must include:
       A25.8.3.1. Recommendation by commander to include additional information or evidence of
       material value. If the commander recommends disapproval, complete justification must be pro-
       vided. If the request is based on a spouse’s inability to manage the household in the member’s
       absence due to unique family situations (as defined in AFI 36-2908, Family Care Plans), the com-
       mander’s endorsement must include information about the existence of (or lack thereof) of the
       documented family care plan required by AFI 36-2908. The commander's recommendation
       requirement is waived if the situation precludes the member from obtaining it (request submitted
       while on leave, TDY, etc.). When applicable, the request must include the reason for omitting the
       commander's recommendation.
       A25.8.3.2. The local Special Needs Coordinator must review and provide input on all EFMP
       requests. Input must address the availability of required resources within the current assignment
       locale.
       A25.8.3.3. Requests for reassignment from members serving accompanied OS assignments that
       are based on a lack of the medical, educational, related services, or early intervention services
       required by the family member must include a copy of the AF Form 1466 and the document
       approving/disapproving family member travel.
       A25.8.3.4. Both parties of a military couple must submit a request if the same assignment consid-
       eration is desired. Respective commander endorsements are required.

A25.9. Available Options When an Request is Disapproved. When a request is disapproved, the MPF
must counsel the member on the following options. Members may apply (if eligible) for retirement, retire-
ment under hardship conditions, hardship discharge, or (for officers) resignation or release from active
duty. For those who are pending reassignment a request under this paragraph must be submitted within 7
calendar days following receipt of the correspondence disapproving the request.

A25.10. Withdrawing a Request. If a member wants to withdraw his or her request before a final deci-
sion or departure on reassignment, the request must be submitted in writing to either the MPF or the
AFPC Contact Center, who in turn notifies HQ AFPC/DPAPO immediately. Once a member has departed
on an EFMP reassignment, the request can no longer be withdrawn.
   A25.10.1. A request to withdraw an approved EFMP reassignment that was provided based on either
   a lack of required medical resources within the current locale or on environmental factors that were
   having a life threatening affect on a family member will not be favorably considered unless the situa-
   tion has significantly changed since initial approval.
402                                                    AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


A25.11. EFMP Assignment/TDY Restrictions.
      A25.11.1. A member reassigned or deferred under the EFMP is placed in AAC 34 for 12 months as
      directed by HQ AFPC/DPAPO. If granted a reassignment, members will not be reassigned PCS for at
      least 12 months from date arrived station. A deferment will initially restrict members only from PCS
      for a maximum of 12 months.
      A25.11.2. TDY restriction does not automatically apply to EFMP requests unless specifically
      addressed in approval correspondence from HQ AFPC/DPAPO. A member subject to TDY and
      requesting a restriction must obtain a statement from the attending medical or therapy provider. The
      statement must specify the need for the member’s presence and the duration of the requirement. This
      statement, along with a request according to the example shown in Figure A25.1., are forwarded to
      the AFPC Contact Center. A TDY restriction request is normally approved only on an initial EFMP
      request. When a TDY restriction is requested and approved, the AFPC Contact Center will place the
      member in DAC 44 as directed by HQ AFPC/DPAPO.
      A25.11.3. If a member’s parent organization is relocated or deactivated before expiration of the
      assignment restriction, he or she is reported to the MAJCOM for intracommand reassignment to
      another organization on the same base. If no authorization for their specialty exists on base, or if the
      base is being deactivated, the MAJCOM requests reassignment instructions from HQ AFPC/DPAPO.

A25.12. AF Form 1466, Request for Family Member’s Medical and Educational Clearance for
Travel.
      A25.12.1. All members who have a family member enrolled in the EFMP (assignment limitation
      code “Q”) must complete an AF Form 1466 upon selection for any PCS to a location family members
      are allowed. The AF Form 1466 and other required documentation will be forwarded by the Special
      Needs Coordinator (SNC) or Family Member Relocation Clearance (FMRC) Coordinator at the mem-
      ber’s current duty location to the SNC/FMRC at the projected assignment location to determine if ade-
      quate facilities will be available for the member’s exceptional family members. If family member
      travel is denied, see paragraph A25.6.
      A25.12.2. As mandated by Public Law, public schools and early intervention services are required to
      provide appropriate educational services. While mandated by law, the Air Force requires a member to
      process the AF Form 1466 for a CONUS assignment even though the only need may be for special
      educational, early intervention, or related services. A nonrecommendation for family member travel
      from the gaining location’s Special Needs Coordinator will not result in cancellation of the assign-
      ment unless requested by the member. However, if the member elects to continue with a CONUS
      assignment in this situation, he or she may not later request EFMP reassignment based on a lack of
      services (unless the request is based on a newly identified need).
      A25.12.3. All requests for reassignment or tour curtailment will normally be disapproved when it is
      determined the member caused or contributed to the commission of an AF Form 1466 violation, either
      by falsifying or omitting information. Unless the member’s presence is deemed essential, their family
      members should be returned to the CONUS and the member will be required to complete the remain-
      der of the OS tour established by the original tour election.
      A25.12.4. The AF Form 1466 investigation results will be provided to the losing and gaining com-
      manders by message for possible disciplinary action against a member who caused or contributed to
      the commission of an AF Form 1466 violation.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  403


A25.13. Applicant Responsibilities.
   A25.13.1. Submits the request through the AFPC Contact Center via the vMPF and faxes all required
   endorsements and supporting documentation to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC. Large volume requests can be
   mailed to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC, 550 C Street West, Suite B111, Randolph AFB TX 78150.
   A25.13.2. A member stationed OS and requesting reassignment OS must agree to serve the pre-
   scribed tour length at the new location or at least a tour length equal to the combined unaccompanied
   tour lengths at the old and new locations, whichever is greater. FOR EXAMPLE: if you are serving
   on a 30/18 month OS tour and receive approval for reassignment to a 36/24 month OS tour, you must
   serve the full prescribed tour at the gaining location (36 months), or not less than a tour equal to the
   combined unaccompanied tour lengths (18 plus 24, or 42 months) between the two OS locations
   before reassignment from the theater, whichever is greater. The computation resulting in the greatest
   combined OS tour period being served is the required minimum. The variable is the amount of time
   you have been assigned to the current location.
   A25.13.3. For members en route PCS, they may discuss the problem with the nearest MPF com-
   mander, the AFPC Contact Center, or AFPC/DPAPO personnel to assist in deciding whether or not to
   submit a request. There is no reimbursement authorized if the member decides to travel to the nearest
   base with an MPF and a member's status remains unchanged (for example, leave) if they decide to
   submit a request. The member must comply with current reporting instructions if the assignment
   authority denies suspension of movement; however, a request still can be submitted (see paragraph
   A25.16.6.).
   A25.13.4. If the circumstances of the situation change and the request is still pending, the AFPC Con-
   tact Center must be notified and provided full facts and circumstances immediately. The AFPC Con-
   tact Center provides this information to HQ AFPC/DPAPO who will make the final decision and
   provide a response by message.

A25.14. AFPC Contact Center Responsibilities.
   A25.14.1. Counsels members desiring to submit a request for reassignment/deferment on EFMP pro-
   visions.
   A25.14.2. Ensures the member’s request has all pertinent documentation as outlined in Figure
   A25.1. or A25.2. and this attachment.
   A25.14.3. Processes and forwards to HQ AFPC/DPAPO complete requests within 1 workday after
   receipt from the member. Reasons for exceeding this standard must be explained/provided in the for-
   warding correspondence.
   A25.14.4. Acts as liaison between HQ AFPC/DPAPO and the applicant.
   A25.14.5. Using MilPDS updates the AAC and DOA as directed by HQ AFPC/DPAPO.

A25.15. Commander Responsibilities.
   A25.15.1. Recommends approval/disapproval of the EFMP request and includes any information that
   helps HQ AFPC make a decision. All disapproval recommendations must be fully justified.
   A25.15.2. Does not involuntarily select members TDY deferred for EFMP reasons for TDY in excess
   of 30 calendar days while they are in DAC 44.

A25.16. MPF Responsibilities.
      A25.16.1. Processes requests for delay in reporting when the member’s projected departure date is
      within 30 days.
      A25.16.2. Assists the member with accessing the vMPF applications. Processes requests submitted
      by initial technical training students.
      A25.16.3. Sends a message providing full facts and circumstances to HQ AFPC/DPAPO when the
      reason for the request ceases to exist before the member departs PCS.
      A25.16.4. Counsels the member on other available options if the approval authority disapproves the
      request. See paragraph A25.9.
      A25.16.5. Updates or deletes ALC “Q” from the MilPDS as directed by HQ AFPC/DPAPO or upon
      receipt of written confirmation from the base Special Needs Coordinator.
      A25.16.6. When members are PCS en route to or from an OS area, or are TDY in the CONUS from
      OS, the MPF commander may be contacted for assistance by phone or mail. There is no reimburse-
      ment authorized if the member decides to travel to the nearest base with an MPF. A member's status
      remains unchanged (for example, leave) if they decide to submit a request. The MPF commander will
      assist the member in submission of a formal request for EFMP reassignment or deferment. The MPF
      commander may request to suspend the movement of the member; however, members must be
      advised that their status remains unchanged (for example, leave) if the request for suspension is
      granted while a request is pending. These requests must be forwarded by message to HQ AFPC/
      DPAPO with information copies to the losing and gaining activity and include:
         A25.16.6.1. The member’s name, grade, SSN, SAFSC (officers) or CAFSC (airmen), port call
         date (if applicable), date of EFMP submission (if any), date departed losing organization, losing
         and gaining unit of assignment, and RNLTD.
         A25.16.6.2. A brief summary of the situation and any relevant supporting information.
         A25.16.6.3. Counsels the member on the provisions of AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, if
         the member has an advance (negative) leave balance when suspending movement or when submit-
         ting the request. NOTE: The time between the request submission and the approval authority’s
         final action is considered leave.
         A25.16.6.4. If the request for suspension of movement is denied, the member may still elect to
         submit an EFMP request but he or she must comply with the current reporting instructions.
         Requests for a new port call date or a change in RNLTD will not be submitted after denial of the
         request for suspension of movement.

IN TURN
FROM: (Functional Address Symbol)
SUBJECT: EFMP (Reassignment) (Deferment) (TDY Deferment) Request
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOU FULLY DOCUMENT AND SUBSTANTIATE YOUR REQUEST.
FAILURE TO PROVIDE ALL REQUESTED INFORMATION WILL DELAY A FINAL DECISION
1. I request (reassignment) (deferment) in order to (establish) (continue) an EFMP. The circumstances
are: (Give specific reasons why you cannot establish or continue the EFMP at the current or projected
location. If requesting a TDY restriction, justify why your presence is required and specify expected
duration. Give all relevant information.)
2. I have taken the following actions/steps to improve my worldwide availability: (Note: Information
concerning the existence of a viable family care plan according to AFI 36-2908 must be included in this
paragraph if the request is based on a spouse’s medical or emotional problems that make his or her ability
to manage the household questionable in your absence. Information addressing why a care plan was not
established or why an existing one is no longer viable is required.)
3. I submit the following supporting information:
   a. Organization and Location (current and projected), E-mail address, fax phone number, and phone
   number where you can reach me:
   b. Name, Date of Birth (of children), and Home Address of Exceptional Family Member Concerned:
   c. Current leave address, date leave expires, leave telephone number, and E-mail address:
4. I have (not) been previously (reassigned) (deferred) (TDY restricted) for EFMP reasons. If so, indicate
date and reason.
5. I understand my EFMP assignment will depend on manning requirements at the time I am available
for reassignment. If Air Force manning needs allow and required services are available, I prefer
reassignment to ______________________.
6. (Members serving OS.) If reassigned to another OS location within the same theater, I do (not)
volunteer to serve either the full accompanied tour length at the gaining location, or at least a tour length
equal to the combined unaccompanied tour lengths specified for the losing and gaining locations,
whichever is greater, prior to being reassigned from the oversea theater.
7. I do/do not have an active duty spouse. If so, I understand he/she must either submit a separate request
or sign this request. In either case, an endorsement from both commanders is required. I understand that
my spouse will not receive assignment/deferment consideration without the appropriate endorsements
and signatures.

8. (Airmen Only) (While retraining is not normally done on an EFMP request, it is sometimes
necessary.) I will (not) accept voluntary retraining (if necessary) for approval of my request. I understand
I will incur an assignment restriction due to my retraining. I also understand future assignment or
utilization in a previously held specialty will depend on Air Force manning requirements and that I may
be required to remain in the retraining AFSC for an indefinite period.
9. I understand if changes occur to the situation presented, whether prior to a final decision, my
departure, or after approval, I must advise either the Military Personnel Flight or AFPC Contact Center
immediately.

                                                 Name, Grade, USAF, SSN
Attachments:
1. AF Form 1466*
2. Special Needs Coordinator Input
3. DD Form 2792 with applicable addendums
4. Individualized Education Plan and/or Individualized Family Service Plan (Required when request is
based on special education needs)
5. Any other documentation your want considered
NOTE: You must include statements from medical and educational providers (as appropriate). When
the program involves a need for a combination of these services, it is especially important you include all
pertinent data to ensure proper assignment decision. If the EFMP request is for reassignment, the Special
Needs Coordinator must state whether or not adequate services are available anywhere within the local
area.
*The AF Form 1466 is required only if request is for reassignment from either an overseas or CONUS
location due to inadequate medical care or educational services. In this situation attach a copy of the AF
Form 1466 and the document (if other than the AF Form 1466) which approved family member travel to
that area. If request is for assignment diversion or cancellation based on disapproved family member
travel, include a copy of the AF Form 1466 and the denial determination. If request is based on a need for
reassignment due to a condition diagnosed after arrival at the assignment location and there are no other
special needs of family members, an AF Form 1466 is not required.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE APPROVAL AUTHORITY CAN ONLY
CONSIDER WHAT IS SUBMITTED FOR REVIEW.

gram (VECAP) due to changes to the BOP Program (Attachment 13, paragraph 2.70.). Clarifies and
divides Humanitarian and EFMP reassignments and deferment guidance (deletes Attachment 7, adds
Attachment 24 and Attachment 25 and changes Table 1.1., Table 2.1., and Table 2.2.). Adds guidance
on Air Force Academy graduate accessions and members cross-commissioning from other Service Acad-
emies (Attachment 22, paragraph A22.2.1.). Corrects the terminology for USAF Academy tenured fac-
ulty (AAC 22) and changed the deferment period from 4 to 3 years (Table 2.1., Rule 16). Changes CMSgt
Utilization (AAC 85) to reflect High School Senior Deferment (Table 2.1., rule 64). Adds Korea Assign-
ment Incentive Pay (AAC 65) (Table 2.1., rule 65). Deletes VECAP assignment availability code refer-
ence (Table 2.1., note 3). Deletes VECAP and BOP assignment limitation code reference (Table 2.2.,
note 2). See the last attachment of the publication, IC 2005-1, for the complete IC. A bar (/) indicates revi-

NOTES:
1. Use this table in conjunction with paragraph 2.15.
a. See the Stabilized Tour Guide for a list of organizations authorized stabilized tours (organizational
deferment), the length of the tour (deferment), and if the tour is designated a minimum or maximum tour.
b. An AAC does not preclude a mandatory PCS (see Attachment 1 for definition of mandatory PCS),
unless note 8 is indicated for that code.
2. Do not update for members assigned OS.
3. Member is not eligible to apply for the following self-initiated assignment programs until the deferment
has expired: join-spouse, non-CONUS resident, to or from CONUS-isolated tour, CONUS assignment
exchange, expanded permissive, COT, COT follow-on (see paragraph 2.40.3.13.), and (airmen only)
BOP, and VSBAP. A member who had an action approved under one of these programs before being
placed in a code making them ineligible may retain the previously approved action if expiration of the
ineligibility condition is before the departure date/DEROS. An RNLTD will not be changed for the sole
purpose of allowing a member's deferment to expire before the departure date/DEROS.
4. Does not apply to CMSgts. Do not update unless specifically authorized by HQ AFPC/DPAC.
5. If the airman refuses to obtain retainability to fulfill the CDA commitment or ADSC for directed train-
ing with a PCS, then the MPF reclamas the assignment.
6. As determined by AFI 51-703, Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction: Policies and Procedures.
7. Do not involuntarily extend member's DEROS. Retain member in place, but allow DEROS to expire
(unless a voluntary DEROS extension is requested and approved).
8. Includes mandatory PCS.
9. Civil Court deferment is only to appear as a witness on behalf of any party in connection with judicial
proceedings to which the United States is a party (includes hospital recovery claims).
10. Advise the assignment OPR with information addressee of HQ AFPC/DPAPP1 when placing the
member in this code and PCS is mandatory.
11. Requires assignment OPR approval prior to update of this code on an individual. The assignment
action reason (AAR) for a PCS or other similar approval (such as a letter/memo, assignment trailer
remarks, approved application, PCS orders, and so on) may be used by MPFs as authority for update of an
AAC.
12. Although every effort is made to ensure completion of the 2-year deferment, the deferment may end
before the scheduled date in order to meet manning needs having a higher priority. HQ AFPC/DPAAS
must approve all waivers of the date of availability for FY airman retraining program or PALACE FIRST
retrainees. Waiver authority for NCOs retraining under FY airman retraining program and subsequently
selected for CMSgt is HQ AFPC/DPAC.
13. Applies only to officers assigned to joint activities who are assigned to formally designated JDA posi-
tions. Does not include officers assigned to joint activities in non-JDA positions.
14. Also use for officers assigned in the CONUS (only) to joint activities in non-JDA positions.
15. Airmen receiving OTEIP pay may depart current OS location within the month and year of availabil-
ity date shown.

NOTES:
1. For pregnancy, see paragraph 2.39. and AAC 81, Table 2.1. For adoption, see paragraph 2.19.
2. Airman is not eligible to apply for the following self-initiated assignment programs: join-spouse, base
of preference, to or from CONUS-isolated tour, VSBAP, CONUS assignment exchange, expanded per-
missive, COT, or COT follow-on (see paragraph 2.40.3.13.).
3. Includes Enlistment Bonus (EB), Broken Service Selective Reenlistment Bonus (BSSRB), or Selective
Reenlistment Bonus (SRB).
4. MPFs update ALC “Q” only when instructed to do so by HQ AFPC/DPAPO or upon written confirma-
tion from the base Special Needs Coordinator that a member has a family member who meets DoD enroll-
ment criteria for the EFMP. Delete the “Q” code only when instructed to do so by HQ AFPC/DPAPO or
upon written confirmation from the base Special Needs Coordinator that the special needs no longer exist.
5. A first-term airman, selected as a volunteer for an extended long OS tour can delay obtaining retainabil-
ity for a portion of the extended OS tour until after arrival OS. See paragraph 2.29. and Table 2.7. for
details. The losing MPF will input ALC 8 for approved delays with expiration date of the projected tour
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                     451


completion date for the full extended tour. The gaining OS MPF will verify the projected tour completion
date and correct when necessary. Upon reenlistment, the DEROS automatically changes to reflect com-
pletion of the full prescribed extended OS tour length.


2.9.1. Utilization Standards for Rated Officers. The Aviation Career Improvement Act of 1989 (ACIA),
codified as Title 37, U.S.C., Section 301a, imposes utilization standards, commonly referred to as “gates,”
which require that rated officers be assigned to operational flying duties for specific amounts of time by
12 years (1st gate), or 18 years (2nd/3rd gate) of aviation service to maintain their entitlement to continu-
ous aviation career incentive pay (ACIP). Duties that qualify as operational flying duties are identified by
aircrew position identifier (API) codes 1, 2, 6, 7 and 8. Aircrew Position Indicator (API) codes 0, 3 and 4
identify other than operational flying duty. A rated officer must perform at least 8 years (96 months-1st
gate) of operational flying duty by the 12th year of aviation service to receive ACIP through 18 years of
aviation service; at least 10 years (120 months-2nd gate) of operational flying duty by the 18th year of
aviation service to receive ACIP through 22 years of officer service; and at least 12 years (144 months-3rd
gate) of operational flying duty by the 18th year of aviation service to receive ACIP through 25 years of
officer service. It is Air Force policy that as many members as possible perform flying duties to meet their
1st and 2nd gates. Not all officers will fulfill the requirements for their 3rd gate. AFI 11-401, Flight Man-
agement, Chapter 2, explains these requirements in detail. Compliance with the following guidance in
combination with paragraph 2.45., Officer Duty Changes is essential so the careers of rated officers are
properly managed and each flyer maintains rated skills while concurrently meeting Air Force require-
ments in other than flying duties. Waivers of the following policies require HQ AFPC/DPAO approval.
2.9.1.1. Graduates of undergraduate flying training (UFT) are assigned to operational flying duties until
they have completed 96 months of flying to the maximum extent possible. Gate credit accumulated during
UFT counts toward this restriction.

MEMORANDUM FOR HQ AFPC/DPAO (date)
FROM: (Functional address symbol)
SUBJECT: Acknowledgment of Understanding -- Aviation Career Improvement Act (ACIA)
1. I, (name, SSN), acknowledge that I voluntarily elect to pursue a non flying duty assignment and will
     fail to achieve my (1st) (2nd) flying gate. (See paragraph 2.9., AFI 36-2110, Assignments.)
2. I recognize this action will terminate my continuous entitlement to Aviation Career Incentive Pay after
passing (12 years of aviation service) (18 years of aviation service) (22 years of officer service). I further
acknowledge understanding that aviation incentive pay after the (12th year of aviation service) (18th year
of aviation service) (22nd year of officer service) is contingent on my having a rated duty AFSC and
being assigned to operational flying duty.

Attachment 2
Base of Preference (BOP) (Airmen Only)
A2.1. Purpose. The first-term airman (FTA) BOP program is a reenlistment incentive under the
CAREERS programs (see AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force). The career airman
BOP program is an incentive for other airmen to continue an Air Force career.
A2.2. FTA Program.
A2.2.1. General Information. In conjunction with reenlistment, FTA may request a PCS BOP or a BOP to
remain in-place. FTA may also request a BOP in conjunction with reenlistment and retraining (see AFI
36-2626, Airman Retraining Program). Airmen may request PCS CONUS to CONUS, or PCS from OS
to CONUS. Airmen in the CONUS (only) may request a BOP to remain in-place. An airman in the
CONUS may apply for a PCS BOP and an in-place BOP at the same time. A FTA PCS BOP is not autho-
rized from CONUS to OS, or OS to OS, since these assignments are made in accordance with OS PCS
selection priorities. An in-place FTA BOP is not authorized for airmen assigned OS since these airmen
have other options to remain at their current OS location consistent with their eligibility.
A2.2.2. Eligibility Criteria and Restrictions. The following general eligibility criteria and restrictions
apply to all FTA BOPs. Additional eligibility criteria and restrictions may apply to a specific BOP option
as shown below. Airmen who are ineligible or who desire BOP consideration other than as authorized
may submit a request as an exception to policy as outlined in paragraph 1.5.
A2.2.2.1. Must have a category of enlistment of “1”; first term airman and never applied for a FTA BOP.
A2.2.2.2. Must be selected under the Selective Reenlistment Program (SRP) and have an approved CJR.
A2.2.2.3. Must not have been selected for PCS or have an ASD (see paragraph 2.30. for ASD based on a
schedule.)
A2.2.2.4. Must not be in AAC 05, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25, 27 as listed in Table 2.1.
A2.2.2.5. Must submit their application prior to reenlistment.
A2.2.2.6. Consecutive BOPs in any combination are not authorized. For example, a FTA who receives an
in-place BOP cannot then receive a career airman PCS BOP. They must have an intervening PCS.
A2.2.2.7. BOP combinations other than those listed are not authorized. For example, airman may not
request a consecutive OS tour (COT) as a BOP.
A2.2.2.8. Military Couples. The join spouse intent code is a major factor when considering the BOP
request from a member of a military couple. Both members of a military couple may request BOP consid-
eration in their own right, if both are eligible. If the intent code is “A” or “B” then the member must
request the same locations in the same order (including in-place), or both requests will be disapproved. If
one member is ineligible, regardless of the reason, both requests will be disapproved. (Exception: For
FTA requesting a BOP in conjunction with retraining or FTA married to another FTA, both members of
the military couple do not have to be eligible for BOP, however, manning must support join spouse to
BOP location.) When one member of a military couple requests a BOP and the intent code is “H” the
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                  453


request will be considered. Refer to Attachment 8, paragraph A8.3.10. and A8.5.2. for information on
how this action may affect future join spouse assignment consideration.
A2.2.2.9. Withdrawal of an approved BOP (PCS or in-place) due to declining retainability constitutes use
of the BOP option, and no further BOP consideration will be given. A voluntary request by an airman to
terminate the 2-year BOP deferment must be submitted through the servicing MPF to the assignment OPR
for consideration. NOTE: Voluntary withdrawal of a BOP application (PCS or in-place) prior to final
decision by HQ AFPC does not constitute usage of BOP.
A2.2.3. Requests Without Retraining.
A2.2.3.1. CONUS to CONUS, PCS only. (When airmen desire both in-place and PCS consideration, use
the in-place (hard-copy) application procedures shown in paragraph A2.2.3.2.3.).
A2.2.3.1.1. Must have at least 12 months TOS as of the PCS departure date.
A2.2.3.1.2. May be considered regardless of overseas vulnerability or stabilized tour status and airman

A2.2.3.1.3.2. Airmen may list up to 8 CONUS bases in order of preference. Preferences will be consid-
ered in the exact order listed. For example, if a request lists two PCS preferences and then an in-place
preference, followed by additional PCS preferences, they will be considered in that order. NOTE: Use
CONUS bases only when indicating a preference. Do not use regions or states as preferences.
A2.2.3.1.3.3. Requests must be submitted before reenlistment. Requests submitted before reenlistment
are processed even if the airman reenlists before the BOP determination is made.
A2.2.3.1.3.4. Commander. Requests for PCS BOP (only) do not have to be reviewed by the commander.
If both PCS and in-place BOP consideration is being requested, then submit a (hard copy) application in
accordance with paragraph A2.2.3.2.3.
A2.2.3.1.3.5. MPF. The MPF reviews eligibility of the applicant and updates hard copy applications via
MilPDS. For applications updated via AMS Web, the appropriate MilPDS BOP transaction will automat-
ically be produced.
A2.2.3.1.3.6. If airman’s request is approved, ensure the airman reenlists within 30 days after PCS notifi-
cation. Airman may request a delay in obtaining retainability when authorized by paragraph 2.29.6.8. and
Table 2.7.
A2.2.3.1.3.7. The gaining MPF updates AAC 28 upon in-processing with an expiration date of 24 months
from DAS.
A2.2.3.1.3.8. AFPC. Approves or disapproves requests. Transmits approvals and disapprovals to MPFs

A2.2.3.3.3. Application Procedures.
A2.2.3.3.3.1. Airman. Airmen serving OS may request BOP consideration after they receive their
DEROS Election Option RIP or Forecast Notification RIP. These RIPs are produced 13 to 15 months
prior to DEROS for members serving where the unaccompanied tour length is 18 months or more, or 10
months prior to DEROS where the unaccompanied tour length is less than 18 months. The RIP must be
returned to the MPF within 30 days of the day it was produced. Members who desire BOP consideration
must make an election on their RIP to retain current DEROS and must obtain the required PCS retainabil-
ity for CONUS PCS consideration as shown in Table 2.5. Airmen apply using Figure A2.1. or via AMS
web. In the event approval of a CONUS BOP is not possible, a CONUS PCS will be provided as a normal
returnee.
A2.2.3.3.3.2. Commander. Applications do not have to be reviewed by the commander.
A2.2.3.3.3.3. MPF. Reviews eligibility of the applicant. Updates hard copy applications via MilPDS. If

A2.2.4.1. CONUS to CONUS PCS and In-Place. Use this paragraph when airmen desire either PCS or
in-place consideration, or both.
A2.2.4.1.1. Application Procedures.
A2.2.4.1.1.1. Airman. Airmen request BOP consideration at the same time they apply for a CJR and
retraining as outlined in AFI 36-2606 and AFI 36-2626. BOP consideration is in the AFSC into which
being retrained. When a BOP is not desired, enter the following statement in the BOP selection of the
retraining application: “I have been told about the BOP program for first-term airmen and do not desire to
apply. I understand I will not be given another opportunity to apply for a first-term airman BOP.”
A2.2.4.1.1.2. BOP preferences are listed in the BOP section of the retraining application. Airmen may list
up to 8 CONUS bases in order of preference. Preferences will be considered in the exact order listed. For
example, if a request lists two PCS preferences and then an in-place preference, followed by additional
PCS preferences, they will be considered in that order. NOTE: Use CONUS bases only when indicating a
preference. Do not use regions or states as preferences.
A2.2.4.1.1.3. The action on a member’s request will vary depending on preferences stated and whether
retraining is accomplished by TDY or PCS. For example, if the retraining is to a PCS course, then the
BOP consideration would be for the first assignment after training is completed. If a BOP request cannot
be approved, then assignment will be based on the needs of the Air Force.
A2.2.4.1.1.4. Commander. Must recommend member for retraining before BOP preferences will receive
consideration.
A2.2.4.1.1.5. MPF.
A2.2.4.1.1.5.1. When retraining requests is approved, airmen are required to get retainability (reenlist) to
accept the retraining action as outlined in AFI 36-2626, Table 3.3. This amount of retainability is normally
less than that required for a CONUS to CONUS PCS (that is 24 months). Therefore, in order to satisfy the
PCS retainability requirement, airmen must satisfactorily complete the retraining course and then reenlist
in the new AFSC before they are permitted to depart from the training location, regardless whether train-
ing is attended in PCS or TDY en route status. If an airman attending training in PCS status refuses to
reenlist, then reclama the retraining PCS assignment per paragraph 2.47. When an airman is attending in
TDY en route status, a delay in obtaining retainability for PCS until award of the 3-skill level is autho-
rized as outlined in Table 2.7., rule 3 and note 6. If the airman refuses to reenlist, then do not permit the
airman to depart the training location and comply with the instructions in Table 2.7., note 6.
A2.2.4.1.1.5.2. When an in-place BOP is approved, MilPDS will automatically update AAC 28 with an
expiration date 24 months from date of approval.
A2.2.4.1.1.5.3. For PCS BOP, the gaining MPF updates AAC 28 upon in-processing with expiration date
of 24 months from DAS.
A2.2.4.1.1.5.4. If the retraining request is disapproved then the BOP request is not considered. Airmen
may request any of the BOP options for which they remain eligible.
A2.2.4.1.1.5.5. AFPC. Approves or disapproves in-place BOP requests via MilPDS.
A2.2.4.2. OS to CONUS (With Retraining).
A2.2.4.2.1. PCS is upon completion of OS tour. DEROS may be extended or curtailed depending on
retraining class start date.
456                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


A2.2.4.2.2. Must not have been selected for PCS
A2.2.4.2.3. Application Procedures.
A2.2.4.2.3.1. Airman. Airman requests BOP consideration at the same time they apply for a CJR and
retraining as outlined in AFI 36-2606 and AFI 36-2626. BOP consideration is in the AFSC into which
being retrained.. When a BOP is not desired, enter the following statement in the BOP section of the
retraining application: “I have been told about the BOP program for first-term airmen and do not desire to
apply. I understand I will not be given another opportunity to apply for a first-term airman BOP.”
A2.2.4.2.3.2. BOP preferences are listed in the BOP section of the retraining application. Airmen may list
up to 8 CONUS bases in order of preference. Prefer3ences will be considered in the exact order listed. For
example, if a request lists two PCS preferences and then an in-place preference, followed by additional
PCS preferences, they will be considered in that order. NOTE: Use CONUS bases only when indicating a
preference. Do not use regions or states as preferences.
A2.2.4.2.3.3. The action on a member’s request will vary depending on preferences stated and whether
retraining is accomplished by TDY or PCS. For example, if the training is to a PCS course then the BOP
consideration would be for the first assignment after training is completed. If a BOP request cannot be
approved, then assignment will be based on the needs of the Air Force.
A2.2.4.2.3.4. Requests must be submitted before reenlistment. Requests submitted before reenlistment
are processed even if the airman reenlists before the BOP determination is made.
A2.2.4.2.3.5. Commander. Must recommend member for retraining before BOP preferences will receive
consideration.
A2.2.4.2.3.6. MPF.
A2.2.4.2.3.6.1. When retaining request is approved, airmen are required to get retainability to accept the
retraining action as outlined in AFI 36-2626, Table 3.3. Normally this satisfies the requirement for OS to
CONUS PCS retainability when course attendance is TDY en route. If an airman is to attend a PCS train-
ing course they must reenlist upon completion of the course and prior to departure on PCS. If the airmen
refuses to reenlist, then reclama the retraining PCS assignment per paragraph 2.47.
A2.2.4.2.3.6.2. The servicing MPF at the BOP location updates AAC 28 and the expiration date is 24
months from the date arrived station.
A2.2.4.2.3.6.3. If the retraining request is approved then the BOP request is not considered. Upon receipt
of disapproved retraining, airmen may request BOP PCS consideration in current AFSC as an exception.
A2.3. Career Airman Program.
A2.3.1. General Information. Career airmen may request a PCS BOP CONUS to CONUS (only) or may
request a BOP to remain in-place at a CONUS location. Other BOP combinations are not authorized since
other assignments are made in accordance with OS PCS selection priorities and OS to CONUS PCS selec-
tion priorities. For airmen currently assigned OS, other programs exist to request to remain at an OS loca-
tion.
A2.3.2. Eligibility Criteria and Restrictions. The following general eligibility criteria and restrictions
apply.
A2.3.2.1. Must have at least 41 months TOS (3 years, 5 months) at the time of application and at least 4
years TOS before PCS departure. EXCEPTION: If currently serving on a minimum stabilized tour of at
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                      457


least 4 years, can apply no earlier than 7 months before completing the stabilized tour. If serving on a
maximum stabilized tour of at least 4 years, can apply no earlier than 12 months and no later than 9
months before completing the stabilized tour.
A2.3.2.2. Must have a category of enlistment code of “2 – Second term airmen” or “4 – Career airman”
and be selected under the SRP.
A2.3.2.3. Must not have been selected for PCS or have an ASD (see paragraph 2.30. for ASD based upon
a schedule).
A2.3.2.4. Must not be in AAC 05, 08, 09, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25, or 27 as listed in Table 2.1.
A2.3.2.5. Consecutive BOPs in any combination are not authorized.
A2.3.2.6. Must have or be eligible to obtain the required retainability
A2.3.2.7. Must not be an OS volunteer or have any other voluntary applications pending.
A2.3.2.8. Airmen vulnerable for OS PCS selection may apply, however, OS vulnerability will be a factor
in approval or disapproval.
A2.3.2.9. Manning will be a factor in approval or disapproval.
A2.3.2.10. Airmen may ask for a BOP in an awarded AFSC other than CAFSC; however, approval is
based on the needs of the Air Force. A request for this consideration must specifically be stated in the
remarks of the in-system MilPDS request.
A2.3.2.11. Military Couples. The join spouse intent code is a major factor when considering the BOP
request from a member of a military couple. Both members of a military couple may request BOP consid-
eration in their own right, if both are eligible. If the intent code is “A” or “B” then the member must
request the same locations in the same order (including in-place), or both requests will be disapproved. If
one member is ineligible, regardless of the reason, both requests will be disapproved. (EXCEPTION: For
FTA requesting a BOP in conjunction with retraining or FTA married to another FTA, both members of
the military couple do not have to be eligible for BOP, however, manning must support join spouse to
BOP location.) When one member of a military couple requests a BOP and the intent code is “H” the
request will be considered. Refer to Attachment 8, paragraph A8.3.10. and A8.5.2. for information on
how this action may affect future join spouse assignment consideration.
A2.3.2.12. Withdrawal of an approved BOP (PCS or in-place) due to declining retainability constitutes
use of the BOP option, and no further BOP consideration will be given. A voluntary request by an airman
to terminate the 2-year BOP deferment must be submitted through the servicing MPF to the assignment
OPR for consideration. NOTE: Voluntary withdrawal of a BOP application (PCS or in-place) prior to
final decision by HQ AFPC does not constitute usage of BOP.
A2.3.3. CONUS to CONUS PCS and/or In-Place (CONUS only).
A2.3.3.1. Application Procedures.
A2.3.3.1.1. Airman. Airman may apply for PCS (only) using Figure A2.1. or via AMS Web. If applying
for an in-place BOP (only), or both PCS and in-place BOP, they must use the (hard-copy) application
shown in Figure A2.1.
A2.3.3.1.2. Airman may list up to 8 CONUS bases in order of preference. Preferences will be considered
in the exact order listed. For example, if a request lists two PCS preferences and then an in-place prefer-
458                                                 AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


ence, followed by additional PCS preferences, they will be considered in that order. NOTE: Use CONUS
bases only when indicating a preference. Do not use regions or states as preferences.
A2.3.3.1.3. When a member’s request is disapproved, airmen may resubmit after 6 months from the date
of disapproval when requesting the same locations. The member need not wait six months when request-
ing different locations. There is no limit on the number of times an airman may apply.
A2.3.3.1.4. Commander. Applications for PCS (only) do not have to be reviewed by the commander. If
in-place consideration is being requested (or if both PCS and in-place is requested), then submit a (hard
copy) application using Figure A2.1.
A2.3.3.1.5. MPF. The MPF reviews eligibility of the applicant and updates hard copy applications via
MilPDS. For applications updated via AMS Web, a BOP transaction request will automatically be pro-
duced.
A2.3.3.1.6. If airman’s request is approved, ensure the airman obtains 24 months service retainability
within 30 days of approval notification. Airmen may request a delay in obtaining retainability as outlined
in paragraph 2.29.6.8. and Table 2.7.
A2.3.3.1.7. When an in-place BOP is approved the AAC 28 is automatically updated with an expiration
date 24 months from date of approval. For PCS BOP, the gaining MPF updates AAC 28 upon in-process-
ing with an expiration date 24 months from DAS.
A2.3.3.1.8. AFPC. Approves or disapproves in-place BOP request via MILPDS.

2. (For airmen married to other military members only.) I have been counseled on BOP and
join-spouse assignment criteria. I understand if I request a BOP, I will first be considered for
assignment to my spouse’s location unless join spouse assignment is not desired (intent code H). If I
receive an approved PCS BOP, then join spouse assignment to the BOP location for my spouse is not
authorized. If I proceed on a PCS BOP I understand I am responsible for the family separation
created. I understand we may each request a BOP in our own right to the same location (including
in-place), if we are both eligible. I understand approval of a PCS or in-place BOP does not result in
deferment for my spouse. For FTA retraining under QRP: I understand I will have my BOP
application considered in preference order and my spouse will be considered for a join spouse
assignment unless join spouse assignment is not desired (intent code H). However, I understand that
manning at the requested locations must support both myself and my spouse in order for the
assignments to be approved.
3. I understand I will be required to have or obtain the necessary 24 months retainability (computed
from the RNLTD (Year and month) within 30 days of approval and if I am a FTA I must reenlist to
suffice this retainability requirement. I also understand that voluntary cancellation of an approved
BOP on my behalf or refusal to obtain the necessary retainability constitutes use of my BOP option.

PCS OF MEMBERS DIRECTED UNDER AUTHORITY OF ANOTHER PRESCRIBING
INSTRUCTION (LIEUTENANT COLONEL AND BELOW AND ALL AIRMEN)
460                                                 AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


A22.1. Introduction. While the term “assignments” is frequently used to describe all PCSs, the fact is
there are various types of PCS moves directed by OPRs not within the HQ AFPC Directorate of Assign-
ments which are made under the authority of another prescribing instruction. As a reminder, with the
exception of patient assignments, assignment OPRs within the HQ AFPC Directorate of Assignments are
responsible for only operational, rotational, force structure, and training PCSs.
A22.2. PCS in Conjunction With Other Actions. The following PCSs, with the exception of some
patient assignments, are directed by OPRs outside the HQ AFPC Directorate of Assignments. The OPR
for the action concerned is the OPR for the PCS and is the PCS Authority.
A22.2.1. Accession PCSs (except for medical officers which is HQ AFPC/DPAM). OPR is HQ AFPC/
DPPA. With the exception of those designated at the discretion of the Secretary and Chief of Staff,
assignments of all USAF Academy graduate accessions or members cross-commissioning from other
Service Academies will be assigned at or below the wing level.
A22.2.2. PCS in conjunction with separation and retirement (includes for processing of administrative
separation/discharge). OPR is HQ AFPC/DPPR.
A22.2.3. PCS of patients to a medical treatment facility (MTF) or between MTFs. OPR can be either the
gaining MTF Commander or HQ AFPC/DPAMM, Medical Standards Branch. Upon release from assign-
ment to the MTF, members will be reported to HQ AFPC/DPAMM who, in turn, will request the assign-
ment OPR direct reassignment as appropriate.
A22.2.4. PCS of prisoners to a confinement facility (including from OS to a CONUS facility) or between
confinement facilities. OPR is AF Corrections.
A22.2.5. PCS of members to locations near their HOR who are placed in appellate leave status incident to
court-martial conviction. OPR is AF/JA.
A22.2.6. PCS or TDY related to judicial proceedings (court-martial or other reasons when directed by the
MAJCOM/JA) according to AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice. OPR is AF/JA.
A22.3. How PCSs Differ. The PCSs listed in paragraph A22.2. (frequently referred to as assignments)
differ from those authorized by this instruction in the following major ways:
A22.3.1. The selection process (qualifications, ODSD/STRD, DAS, TOS, retainability, and so on) pre-
scribed in this instruction to determine which individual will be selected for PCS does not apply.
A22.3.2. The purpose of the PCS is not to fill a valid manpower authorization at the gaining location and/
or the have the member perform duty in his/her AFSC.
A22.3.3. The PCSs are not projected in the PDS and do not need an operational, rotational, or training
AAN. The member is “assigned” using unprojected gain procedures provided in AFCSM 36-699.
A22.3.4. It may not be appropriate for the cost of the PCS to be charged to the same PCS ID codes used
for operational, rotational, and training assignments.
A22.3.5. It is incorrect to cite AFI 36-2110, Assignments, as the “authority” for the PCS.
A22.3.6. 7-day option procedures do not apply.
A22.4. Similarities of the PCSs. Similarities do exist between the PCSs listed in paragraph A22.2. and
those authorized by this instruction and directed by the assignment OPRs shown in table 1. They include:
A22.4.1. The member may change unit of assignment and/or make a permanent change of station.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 461


A22.4.2. Most of the moves involve an order directing the PCS.
A22.4.3. The PCS entitlements members may accrue may be different for each kind of PCS.
A22.4.4. Because relocation is involved, MPFs assist those agencies directing the PCS and in processing
the member for PCS.
Attachment 24
HUMANITARIAN REASSIGNMENT AND DEFERMENT
A24.1. Humanitarian Reassignment/Deferment General Provisions/Policy.
A24.1.1. Waivers to these provisions require prior approval of HQ AFPC/DPAPO.
A24.1.2. The Comptroller General has ruled that the move of Air Force members from one place to
another may not be made at government expense based solely on humanitarian reasons. The determining
factor in the approval of a request for reassignment is the needs of the Air Force.
A24.1.3. A request for humanitarian reassignment or deferment is considered based on individual merit
taking into account the human factors involved, the applicant’s skills and length of service, and manning
priorities and requirements. A request may be approved when it is clearly in the best interest of the Air
Force.
A24.1.4. A request for humanitarian reassignment may warrant giving assignment preference to the appli-
cant based on the facts presented. The fact that the move would increase the morale and effectiveness of
the Air Force member may be considered in authorizing PCS in these circumstances, but assignment on
this fact alone is not authorized.
A24.1.5. The reassignment or deferment request must be initiated by the member concerned. A request
initiated/submitted by one person on behalf of another is not accepted.
A24.1.6. Emergency or ordinary leave is to be used first as a means of easing family hardships or prob-
lems before applying for humanitarian reassignment.
A24.1.7. All Air Force personnel must be able to respond to any contingency wherever and whenever
called upon to do so. The Air Force is also committed to equal distribution of overseas assignments.
Therefore, permanent or prolonged deferment from reassignment cannot be considered. If a reassignment
or temporary period of deferment is approved, the member must thereafter revert to worldwide assignable
status.
A24.1.8. A humanitarian request is approved on its own merit, and will not be disapproved based solely
on the member’s substandard performance and (or) conduct. Members will only be delayed from depart-
ing PCS when they are required to remain for completion of investigation and trial by US military or civil
authorities, administrative actions under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, or AFI 36-3206, Admin-
istrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers, or AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of
Airmen. When a reassignment request has been approved and administrative separation is not deemed
appropriate, the losing commander must formally notify the gaining commander, in writing, of any
incomplete administrative or disciplinary actions and provide a comprehensive analysis of the member’s
job related or personal problems.
A24.1.9. A humanitarian reassignment or deferment is normally a one-time action to solve a problem
within a reasonable period of time.

A24.1.10. For lieutenant colonels and below and all airmen (except those attending initial technical train-
ing), requests must be submitted via the virtual MPF (vMPF) with supporting documentation to the AFPC
Contact Center, HQ AFPC/DPFFCC.. Once a request is complete it will be provided for consideration to
HQ AFPC/DPAPO. Large volume requests may be mailed to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC, 550 C Street West,
Suite B111, Randolph AFB TX 78150. For colonels (including selectees), requests are submitted to AFS-
LMO, Crystal Plaza 6 Suite 500, 2221 S. Clark Street, Arlington VA 22202. Throughout this attachment
when HQ AFPC/DPAPO is referred to, substitute AFSLMO if the applicant is a colonel or colonel
selectee.
A24.2. For the Purpose of Humanitarian Consideration, the Following Terms are Explained.
A24.2.1. Family Member: Limited to spouse, child, father, mother, father-in-law, mother-in-law, steppar-
ent, person in loco parentis, or other persons actually residing in the household who are dependent for
over half of their financial support. While siblings (brothers and sisters of the member or spouse) are not
within the definition of family member in this attachment, requests involving the terminal illness of a sib-
ling may be forwarded for consideration as an exception to policy.
A24.2.2. Person in “Loco Parentis:” A person in loco parentis refers to one who exercised parental rights,
duties, and responsibilities and, in fact, raised a member or spouse for a minimum of 5 years in place of a
mother or father because of death of the parent, or in the parent’s continued absence from the home before
the member’s or spouse’s 21st birthday, or before the member’s entry on active duty, whichever is earlier.
The relationship must have been such that the member or spouse looked upon the person as a parent, not
merely as a temporary guardian. The mere presence of a person in the home for a number of years, during
which time they exercised a degree of custodial, but not parental responsibility, does not constitute loco
parentis. Also, in order for the child to have been in the care and control of one acting in place of the par-
ent, the parent cannot have also resided in the same home (unless the parent was mentally incompetent).
A24.2.2.1. A request based on loco parentis status must include affidavits from all parties (to include
other family members, neighbors, clergy, or family friends) involved stating the details of the custody,
control, care, and management of the member or his or her spouse. In addition, submit copies of any doc-
uments that may have been created at the time loco parentis status was established relating to the custody,
control, care, and management of the member or spouse (court documents, tax returns, report cards signed
by the loco parentis “parent,” etc.)
A24.3. Identifying and Reporting Humanitarian Conditions.
A24.3.1. A member desiring humanitarian deferment must formally submit his or her request to the AFPC
Contact Center within 30 calendar days from PCS reassignment notification, nomination to HQ AFPC or
MAJCOM, or selection for TDY in excess of 30 calendar days.
A24.3.2. Should humanitarian conditions arise after PCS notification or other event notification, the
member must submit his or her formal request to the AFPC Contact Center for consideration within 30
calendar days.
A24.3.3. If a member submits a request for reassignment or deferment and the circumstances change prior
to a final decision or the member’s departure on assignment, he or she must immediately inform either the
MPF or the AFPC Contact Center, who in turn notifies HQ AFPC/DPAPO. A message reply will be pro-
vided with final disposition instructions.
A24.4. Spirit and Intent of the Humanitarian Program.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    463


A24.4.1. The Humanitarian Program was established to assist members in resolving severe short-term
problems involving a family member. Members must be effectively utilized in their duty (officer) or con-
trol (enlisted) AFSC.
A24.4.2. When a request involves reassignment, it will normally be to the closest location to where the
family member concerned resides so the member can provide the family member maximum support, con-
sistent with the manning needs of the Air Force. As a general rule, reassignment into a special duty posi-
tion is not considered since the selection process for such duties can be quite involved and often requires
an application to the “hiring authority.” Also, retraining into a special duty position is not considered
based on the lack of training capability.
A24.5. Basic Eligibility Criteria for Humanitarian Reassignment/Deferment. In addition to substan-
tiating a humanitarian problem, the following basic criteria must be met before a request can be approved.
A24.5.1. A vacancy must exist at the new duty station if a PCS is involved and the member must meet ser-
vice retainability requirements for PCS.
A24.5.2. The member must be experiencing a problem involving a family member (see paragraphs
A24.2.1. and A24.2.2.) that is more severe than usually encountered by other Air Force members with a
similar problem.
A24.5.3. The member’s presence must be absolutely essential to alleviate the problem.
A24.5.4. The problem can be resolved within a reasonable period of time (normally 12 months).
A24.6. Humanitarian Conditions Usually Warranting Approval. It is impractical to try to list all the
conditions for which a humanitarian reassignment or deferment may be approved. The factors to be con-
sidered vary from case to case and the number of possible situations and circumstances are almost infi-
nite. However, requests substantiating problems arising from any of the following circumstances usually
warrant approval:
A24.6.1. The recent death (within 12 months) of the member’s spouse or child, including miscarriages of
20 weeks or more gestation. Humanitarian reassignment is normally approved on the death of a child or
stepchild under the age of 18 who is living in the member’s home at the time of death. A request based on
a child or stepchild who is over the age of 18 will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Reassignment
made under this provision will normally be considered to only one of two locations -- either near extended
family for support or to the closest available base to the burial site. The overall consideration will be the
needs of the Air Force and retraining is not usually considered in this type request; however, every effort
will be made to ensure the member is provided an assignment as close to the area of support as possible.
A24.6.2. The member has a serious financial problem not the result of overextension of personal military
income (such as loss of primary home of residence where member or spouse and children currently reside,
or loss of possessions through fire, theft, or natural disaster), and the member will suffer a substantial
financial loss unless his or her presence or continued presence can be ensured. It must be shown that the
problem cannot be resolved by leave, correspondence, power of attorney, or by any other person or
means.
A24.6.3. The member is serving an unaccompanied OS tour and his or her spouse abandons their children.
It must be shown it is not possible for the children to join the member at the OS location when an accom-
panied tour is authorized and that the member’s presence is necessary. The assignment location under this
provision will be based on the needs of the Air Force.
464                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


A24.6.4. The terminal illness of a family member (see paragraph A24.2.1. and A24.2.2. for definition of
family members for the purpose of humanitarian reassignment) when death is imminent within 2 years. A
doctor's prognosis of a terminal illness must be fully supported and substantiated by clinical data. In such
cases, the member’s presence is considered essential regardless of the availability of other family mem-
bers to assist.
A24.6.5. An authorized state or local agency places a child in the member’s home and deferment is nec-
essary to comply with state or local laws to complete final adoption. Reassignment to pursue adoption is
not normally authorized.
A24.6.6. Reassignment or deferment is essential in establishing or operating an effective family advocacy
program according to AFI 40-301, Family Advocacy. Documentation from the base Family Advocacy
Officer is required. NOTE: While requests for humanitarian consideration must be initiated by the mem-
ber, there are some instances involving family advocacy issues where the member does not desire assign-
ment or assignment cancellation and there are no quality control factors that would support such action. In
these situations, the member’s commander can request assignment or assignment cancellation via human-
itarian deferment when the basis is to continue or obtain treatment for family advocacy issues. The
request must be fully documented and endorsed by the local Family Advocacy Officer (see paragraph
3.8.10.2. for personnel assigned overseas).
A24.6.7. Sexual abuse and/or assault of the member’s spouse or child when it has been determined and
fully substantiated by appropriate medical authority that remaining in the area where the incident occurred
would be detrimental to the health of the family member. While the applicant may request a specific base
for reassignment, manning must fully support as the main consideration is to relocate away from where
the incident occurred. Retraining is not usually considered for this type request.
A24.7. Reasons Humanitarian Requests are Usually Disapproved. Requests for reassignment or
deferment are usually disapproved when it is probable that the problem will exist for an indefinite period
of time, or the request is based on one of the following circumstances:
A24.7.1. A desire to provide emotional or domiciliary support to a parent or parent-in-law due to age,
non-terminal or chronic illness or disability, or recent death in the family.
A24.7.2. Problems associated with child care arrangements, or a single parent’s desire to make or facili-
tate either short or long term child care arrangements.
A24.7.3. Psychoneurosis (such as various psychic or mental disorders characterized by special combina-
tions of anxieties, compulsions, obsessions, phobias, and motor or sensory manifestations) resulting from
family separation incident to military assignment.
A24.7.4. Normal pregnancy, threatened miscarriage, breech birth, Cesarean section, or RH incompatibil-
ity.
A24.7.5. The existence of a housing shortage or home ownership problems.
A24.7.6. A financial problem, to include bankruptcy, resulting from over-extension of military income.
A24.7.7. A financial or management problem related to off-duty employment, the spouse’s employment,
private business activities, or to settle an estate.
A24.7.8. Passport or visa problems involving newly acquired family members.
A24.7.9. Threatened separation, divorce action, or the desire to pursue child custody.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                465


A24.7.10. The problem existed or was reasonably foreseeable at the time of latest entry on active duty
without a break in service, or prior to departure on PCS.
A24.7.11. For the purpose of seeking or providing family support except as outlined in paragraphs
A24.6.1. or A24.6.4.
A24.7.12. A consecutive PCS or deferment based on continuation of the same circumstances (does not
include a request to extend a current deferment--see paragraph A24.11.).
A24.7.13. A request based on the medical condition of the Air Force member. (Assignment for this reason
is initiated by local medical authorities when it is determined the situation warrants such action.)
A24.7.14. Requests for deferment will not be considered for members who have not been selected and
notified of reassignment or TDY in excess of 30 days. A deferment request can be considered based on
the member’s appearance on the Vulnerable Mover List (VML) if coordination with the appropriate
assignment officer confirms assignment selection is highly likely.
A24.8. Processing Humanitarian Requests.
A24.8.1. The final approval/disapproval authority is HQ AFPC/DPAPO. A request cannot be approved or
denied at a lower level.
A24.8.2. The applicant submits the request through the AFPC Contact Center via the vMPF. All required
information according to Figure A24.1., plus supporting documentation, is necessary or the request can-
not be processed.
A24.8.2.1. A member desiring humanitarian reassignment who also has a spouse or child(ren) enrolled in
the EFMP must include appropriate medical or educational documentation concerning the EFMP situa-
tion with the humanitarian request (DD Form 2792, plus addendums). A humanitarian reassignment can-
not be approved unless the projected assignment location can meet the needs of the exceptional family
member.
A24.8.2.2. Once the Contact Center receives the complete request, to include supporting documentation,
from the member, it must be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAPO within 1 workday.
A24.8.3. Forwarding endorsements and correspondence must include:
A24.8.3.1. Recommendation by commander to include additional information or evidence of material
value. If the commander recommends disapproval, complete justification must be provided. The com-
mander's recommendation requirement is waived if the situation precludes the member from reasonably
obtaining it (request submitted while on leave, TDY, etc.). When applicable, the request must include the
reason for omitting the commander's recommendation.
A24.8.3.2. Both members of a military couple must submit a request if the same assignment consideration
is desired. When both apply, respective commander endorsements are required.
A24.9. Available Options When a Request is Disapproved. When a request is disapproved the MPF
must counsel the member on the following options: Members may apply (if eligible) for retirement, retire-
ment under hardship conditions, hardship discharge, or (for officers) resignation or release from active
duty. For those who are pending reassignment a request under this paragraph must be submitted within 7
calendar days following receipt of the correspondence disapproving the request.
A24.10. Withdrawing a Request. If a member wants to withdraw his or her request before a final deci-
sion or departure on reassignment, the request must be submitted in writing to either the MPF or the
466                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


AFPC Contact Center, who in turn notifies HQ AFPC/DPAPO immediately. Once a member has departed
on a humanitarian reassignment, the request can no longer be withdrawn.
A24.11. Humanitarian Assignment/TDY Restrictions.
A24.11.1. The TDY assignment authority will not select a member for TDY exceeding 30 calendar days
while in humanitarian deferment (AAC 30, Table 2.1.). If provided a humanitarian reassignment, mem-
bers will not be reassigned PCS for at least 12 months from date arrived station. A deferment will initially
restrict members from PCS or TDY for a maximum of 12 months. The initial period of assignment/TDY
restriction for humanitarian reasons may be extended at the member’s request provided the total period
does not exceed 18 months. If a terminal illness is involved, deferment may be extended up to a total of
24 months. Requests for such extensions are submitted using Figure A24.1. and must substantiate that:
A24.11.1.1. Every possible effort has been made to overcome the problem.
A24.11.1.2. The condition warranting assignment/TDY restriction still exists.
A24.11.1.3. The problem can be resolved within the extended period of assignment/TDY restriction.
A24.11.2. If a member’s parent organization is relocated or deactivated before expiration of the assign-
ment restriction, he or she is reported to the MAJCOM for intracommand reassignment to another organi-
zation on the same base. If no authorization for their specialty exists on base, or if the base is being
deactivated, the MAJCOM requests reassignment instructions from HQ AFPC/DPAPO.
A24.12. Applicant Responsibilities.
A24.12.1. Emergency or ordinary leave must be used first as a means of resolving the problem.
A24.12.2. Submits the request through the AFPC Contact Center via the vMPF and faxes all required
endorsements and supporting documentation to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC. Large volume requests may be
mailed to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC, 550 C Street West, Suite B111, Randolph AFB TX 78150.
A24.12.3. A member stationed OS and requesting reassignment OS must agree to serve the prescribed
tour length at the new location or at least a tour length equal to the combined unaccompanied tour lengths
at the old and new locations, whichever is greater. FOR EXAMPLE, if you are serving on a 30/18 month
OS tour and receive approval for reassignment to a 36/24 month OS tour, you must serve the full pre-
scribed tour at the gaining location (36 months), or not less than a tour equal to the combined unaccompa-
nied tour lengths (18 plus 24, or 42 months) between the two OS locations before reassignment from the
theater, whichever is greater. The computation resulting in the greatest combined OS tour period being
served is the required minimum. The variable is the amount of time you have been assigned to the current
location.
A24.12.4. For members enroute PCS, they may discuss the problem with the nearest MPF commander,
the AFPC Contact Center, or AFPC/DPAPO personnel to assist in deciding whether or not to submit a
request. There is no reimbursement authorized if the member decides to travel to the nearest base with an
MPF and a member's status remains unchanged (for example, leave) if they decide to submit a request.
The member must comply with current reporting instructions if the assignment authority denies suspen-
sion of movement; however, a request still can be submitted (see paragraph A24.15.6.).
A24.12.5. If a request for assignment is to a dependent-restricted area and the member’s foreign-born
spouse will be traveling to the native country, such information must be included in the humanitarian
request. If reassignment is approved, a request for a designated location move (DLM) to the native coun-
try must be processed per AFI 36-3020, Family Member Travel.
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                     467


A24.12.6. If the circumstances of the situation change and the request is still pending, the AFPC Contact
Center must be notified immediately. An approved humanitarian reassignment is normally canceled if the
situation for which granted ceases to exist before the member’s departure. In this instance the member
must include in the notification to the AFPC Contact Center information and supporting documentation to
show what actions have been taken regarding the reassignment. The AFPC Contact Center provides this
information to HQ AFPC/DPAPO who will make the final decision and provide a response by message.
A24.12.7. Once a request has been approved the member must notify the MPF when the situation upon
which approval was granted ceases to exist. Once notified the MPF deletes AAC 30 and the accompany-
ing deployment availability code.
A24.13. AFPC Contact Center Responsibilities.
A24.13.1. Counsels members desiring to submit a request for reassignment/deferment on humanitarian
provisions.
A24.13.2. Ensures the member’s request has all pertinent documentation as outlined in figure A7.1 and
this attachment.
A24.13.3. Processes and forwards to HQ AFPC/DPAPO complete requests within 1 workday after receipt
from the member. Reasons for exceeding this standard must be explained/provided in the forwarding cor-
respondence.
A24.13.4. Acts as liaison between HQ AFPC/DPAPO and the applicant.
A24.13.5. Using MilPDS updates the AAC and DOA as directed by HQ AFPC/DPAPO.
A24.14. Commander Responsibilities.
A24.14.1. Recommends approval/disapproval of the humanitarian request and includes any information
that helps HQ AFPC make a decision. All disapproval recommendations must be fully justified.
A24.14.2. Does not select members assigned or deferred for humanitarian reasons for TDY in excess of
30 calendar days while they are in AAC 30.
A24.14.3. When the criteria for immediate reassignment are met (for example, death of a dependent
child), commanders will ensure appropriate officials (e.g., medical, legal, OSI, etc.) are aware of the
member’s reassignment request and the probability of approval and immediate departure on PCS.
A24.15. MPF Responsibilities.
A24.15.1. Processes requests for delay in reporting when applicant’s projected departure date is within 30
days.
A24.15.2. Assists the member with accessing the vMPF applications. Processes requests submitted by ini-
tial technical training students.
A24.15.3. Sends a message providing full facts and circumstances to AFPC/DPAPO when the reason for
the request ceases to exist before the applicant departs PCS.
A24.15.4. Counsels the applicant on other available options if the approval authority disapproves the
request. See paragraph A24.9.
A24.15.5. Deletes an AAC or deployment restriction when appropriate. The member must inform the
MPF when the circumstances on which a request was approved ceases to exist and the MPF deletes the
restriction or AAC.
468                                                 AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


A24.15.6. When a member is PCS enroute to or from an OS area, or is TDY in the CONUS from OS, the
MPF commander may be contacted for assistance by phone or mail. There is no reimbursement autho-
rized if the member decides to travel to the nearest base with an MPF. A member's status remains
unchanged (for example, leave) if he or she decides to submit a request. The MPF commander will assist
the member in submission of a formal request for humanitarian reassignment or deferment. The MPF
commander may request to suspend the movement of the member; however, members must be advised
that their status remains unchanged (for example, leave) if the request for suspension is granted while a
request is pending. These requests must be forwarded by message to HQ AFPC/DPAPO with information
copies to the losing and gaining activity and include:
A24.15.6.1. The member’s name, grade, SSN, SAFSC (officers) or CAFSC (airmen), port call date (if
applicable), date of humanitarian submission (if any), date departed losing organization, losing and gain-
ing unit of assignment, and RNLTD.
A24.15.6.2. A brief summary of the situation and any relevant supporting information.
A24.15.6.3. Counsels the member on the provisions of AFI 36-3003, Military Leave Program, if the
member has an advance (negative) leave balance when suspending movement or when submitting the
request. NOTE: The time between the request submission and the approval authority’s final action is con-
sidered leave.
A24.15.6.4. If the request for suspension of movement is denied, the member may still elect to submit a
humanitarian request but also must comply with the current reporting instructions. Requests for a new
port call date or a change in RNLTD will not be submitted after denial of the request for suspension of
movement.

(Appropriate Letterhead)
Dear Doctor: (Date)
I would appreciate, as soon as possible, a medical statement in support of my request for humanitarian
reassignment or deferment based on my ________________ medical condition. Air Force physicians at
the headquarters will review this medical statement and it will be the basis for the medical
recommendation. Please cover in your statement at least the following in professional terminology:
a. Diagnosis.
b. Brief history of illness, including when initially diagnosed.
c. Status of present condition with description of degree of disability.
d. Prognosis. (Resolution of the medical problem by some means within 12 to 18 months is a key factor.)
Fully substantiate and support the prognosis of terminal illness (within 2 years) by clinical data.
e. Therapy, current and contemplated.
f. If applicable, confirm the hospital or institution can accept the patient.
g. Your evaluation of the affect of the presence or absence of the applicant on the medical problem. If
you desire you can seal sensitive information in a separate envelope marked "Sensitive Medical
Data--For Medical Personnel Only."
Thank you for your assistance.
Sincerely,
Signature of Applicant

AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 471


Attachment 25
EXCEPTIONAL FAMILY MEMBER PROGRAM (EFMP)
A25.1. EFMP Reassignment/Deferment General Provisions/Policy.
A25.1.1. Waivers to these provisions require prior approval of HQ AFPC/DPAPO.
A25.1.2. All Air Force personnel must be able to respond to any contingency wherever and whenever
called upon to do so. The Air Force is also committed to equal distribution of overseas assignments. As a
result, permanent or prolonged deferment from reassignment cannot be considered. If a reassignment or
temporary period of deferment is approved, the member must thereafter revert to worldwide assignable
status.
A25.1.3. The reassignment or deferment request must be initiated by the member concerned. A request
initiated/submitted by one person on behalf of another is not accepted.
A25.1.4. An EFMP request is approved on its own merit, and will not be disapproved based solely on the
member’s substandard performance and (or) conduct. Members will only be delayed from departing PCS
when they are required to remain for completion of investigation and trial by US military or civil author-
ities or administrative actions under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, or AFI 36-3206, Administra-
tive Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers, or AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of
Airmen. When a reassignment request has been approved and administrative separation is not deemed
appropriate, the losing commander must formally notify the gaining commander, in writing, of any
incomplete administrative or disciplinary actions and provide a comprehensive analysis of the member’s
job related or personal problems.
A25.1.5. For lieutenant colonels and below and all airmen (except those attending initial technical train-
ing), requests must be submitted via the virtual MPF (vMPF) with supporting documentation to the AFPC
Contact Center, HQ AFPC/DPFFCC. Once a request is complete it will be provided for consideration to
HQ AFPC/DPAPO. Large volume requests may be mailed to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC, 550 C Street West,
Suite B111, Randolph AFB TX 78150. For colonels (including selectees), requests are submitted to AFS-
LMO, Crystal Plaza 6 Suite 500, 2221 S. Clark Street, Arlington VA 22202. Throughout this attachment
when HQ AFPC/DPAPO is referred to, substitute AFSLMO if the applicant is a colonel or colonel
selectee.
A25.2. For the Purpose of the EFMP, the Following Terms are Explained.
A25.2.1. Exceptional Family Member: Limited to the member’s spouse, child, or other person actually
residing in the member’s household who is dependent on the member for over half of his or her financial
support, and who meets DoD criteria for enrollment in the EFMP.
A25.2.2. Special Needs Coordinator (SNC): A medical officer assigned to the medical treatment facility
(MTF) who is appointed as the SNC by the MTF Commander.
A25.2.2.1. Family Member Relocation Clearance (FMRC) Coordinator: A medical technician or civilian
assigned to the MTF who is appointed as the FMRC Coordinator by the MTF Commander.
A25.2.3. General Medical Services (GMS): Encompasses all types of physiological, psychological, or
social conditions of a chronic nature that have been medically diagnosed and that require specialized
treatment.
472                                                   AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


A25.2.4. Special Educational Services (SES): Specially designed instruction to meet the unique educa-
tional needs of a handicapped child, including education provided in school, at home, in a hospital or in
an institution, physical education programs, and vocational educational programs.
A25.2.5. Early Intervention (EI) and/or Related Services (RS): DoDI 1342.12, Provision of Early Inter-
vention and Special Education Services to Eligible DoD Dependents, provides guidance for EI and RS.
Transportation and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive services as required to assist a
child, from birth to 21 years, inclusive, with a disability to benefit from special education under the child's
Individualized Family Service Plan or Individualized Education Plan. EI and RS can include speech-lan-
guage pathology and audiology, psychological services, physical and occupational therapy, recreation
including therapeutic recreation, early identification and assessment of disabilities in children, counseling
services including rehabilitation counseling, orientation and mobility services, and medical services for
diagnostic or evaluative purposes. Special Education Services can also include: school health services,
social work services, parent counseling and training. The sources for these services are the home or com-
munity (natural setting), school (least restrictive environment), and medical treatment facilities.
A25.2.6. Structural Accessibility: Encompasses design modification and enhancements that permit safe
access to or from military housing in accordance with the provisions of the Architectural Barriers Act of
1968 (42 USC, 4151). The immediate nonavailability of structural accessibility requirements at a pro-
jected location will not be a limiting factor for assignment purposes.
A25.3. Identifying and Reporting EFMP Conditions.
A25.3.1. Enrollment in the EFMP is mandatory and requires the identification of all family members
requiring long term general medical, special educational, early intervention (EI) and/or related services
(RS), or modified housing. Members with family members who require general medical, special educa-
tional, EI and/or RS, or modified housing must contact the Special Needs Coordinator in the MTF for a
complete evaluation, assessment, and possible enrollment. Likewise, the Special Needs Coordinator must
be advised immediately following the identification of a family member who has a long term condition
requiring general medical, special educational, EI or RS, or modified housing. The Air Force is commit-
ted to meeting the needs of this unique segment of our Air Force community and must be informed of the
special needs of our members’ families.
A25.3.2. A member desiring EFMP deferment must formally submit his or her request to the AFPC Con-
tact Center within 30 calendar days from PCS reassignment notification or nomination to HQ AFPC or
MAJCOM.
A25.3.3. Should EFMP conditions arise after PCS notification or other event notification, the member
must report them to the Special Needs Coordinator and MPF immediately. If appropriate, the member
must submit his or her formal request to the AFPC Contact Center for consideration within 30 calendar
days.
A25.3.4. If a member submits a request for reassignment or deferment and the circumstances change prior
to a final decision or the member’s departure on assignment, he or she must immediately inform either the
MPF or the AFPC Contact Center, who in turn notifies HQ AFPC/DPAPO. A message reply will be pro-
vided with final disposition instructions.
A25.4. Spirit and Intent of the EFMP.
A25.4.1. EFMP actions are designed to help an Air Force member who has a family member with special
needs that meet DoD enrollment criteria. These problems are usually permanent or long term, and the
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                    473


family may need continued assistance. A member may need EFMP assignment consideration throughout
an entire Air Force career.
A25.4.2. The EFMP is distinct from humanitarian policy and is based on the personnel (manning) require-
ments of the Air Force. The two programs are not interchangeable and the EFMP should not be inter-
preted as a base of choice program. The intent of the EFMP assignment policy is to use the Air Force
member, based on current or projected manning requirements, at locations where required medical, edu-
cational, early intervention, or related services are available either through the military medical system,
through civilian resources utilizing TRICARE, or a combination thereof and local resources. HQ AFPC/
DPAPO, in coordination with the AFPC Medical Staff, assignment OPR, and base level Special Needs
Coordinator, determines a suitable assignment.
A25.4.3. The EFMP provides an initial 12-month deferment for a newly diagnosed condition when the
member’s presence is essential in establishing and/or participating in the treatment program. Deferment
from reassignment may also be appropriate if a treatment program is at a critical juncture and the mem-
ber’s continued presence is absolutely essential to continuing the treatment program. The EFMP also pro-
vides reassignment when a member is assigned to an area and a new medical, special education, related
service, or early intervention need arises for which the needed services are not available within the assign-
ment locale. Once a treatment program is established, whether formally through the EFMP or on the
member’s own initiative, the member is then considered worldwide assignable.
A25.4.4. Enrolling a family member in the EFMP does not negate the member’s responsibility to serve his
or her share of overseas duty, or in meeting deployment requirements.
A25.5. Basic Eligibility Criteria for EFMP Reassignment/Deferment. Members may be provided an
EFMP reassignment or deferment if:
A25.5.1. The member has a family member with a medical or educational requirement that meets the
DoD criteria for enrollment in the EFMP (Assignment Limitation Code “Q” in the MilPDS).
A25.5.2. The Special Needs Coordinator has determined that adequate facilities/resources to meet the
family member’s medical, educational, related service, or early intervention requirements do not exist and
cannot be reasonably provided within the current assignment locale.
A25.5.3. The member’s presence is determined to be essential in establishing, participating in, or continu-
ing a medical regimen or educational program in the present area of assignment. Normally, only one
deferment for the continuing condition of the same family member is permitted and a TDY deferment
(when determined necessary) is normally only provided during the initial assignment deferment period.
A25.5.4. The member was denied family member travel by the gaining MTF based on processing the AF
Form 1466 and other documentation. A facility determination inquiry must be completed to the gaining
location and a copy of the denial document must accompany the EFMP request. Deferment is not nor-
mally granted for this situation; however, cancellation of assignment may be provided or, if the member is
in a mandatory move status (see Attachment 1), an alternate assignment provided. The abbreviated
EFMP application reflected in Figure A25.2. should be used.
A25.6. Assignment Considerations for Members with Exceptional Family Members. Requests for
EFMP consideration are submitted in the following circumstances:
A25.6.1. The member was denied family member travel (members projected to PCS CONUS to CONUS
or overseas (OS) to CONUS) by the gaining MTF based on processing the AF Form 1466 and other doc-
umentation. A facility determination inquiry must be completed to the gaining location and a copy of the
474                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


denial document must accompany the request. Deferment is not normally granted for this situation; how-
ever, cancellation of assignment is provided or, if the member is in a mandatory move status, an alternate
assignment provided. Use the appropriate abbreviated EFMP application reflected in Figure A25.2. and
provide the documentation concerning the denied family member travel (AF Form 1466, DD Form 2792,
etc., that identify the needed resources), and any other documents that were used in the initial family
member clearance process.
A25.6.2. If serving OS accompanied by command sponsored family members, a member may request
reassignment within the OS theater if an unforeseen medical or educational requirement arises after
arrival at the OS base. For an EFMP reassignment within the same OS theater, the member must agree to
serve the full prescribed OS tour length at the gaining location or at least a tour equal to the combined
unaccompanied tour lengths, whichever is greater, prior to being reassigned from the theater. For exam-
ple, if serving on a 30/18 month OS tour and approval is received for assignment to a 36/24 month OS
tour, the member must serve the full prescribed tour at the gaining location (36 months), or not less than a
tour equal to the combined unaccompanied tour lengths (18 plus 24, or 42 months) between the two OS
locations before reassignment from the theater, whichever is greater. The computation resulting in the
greatest combined OS tour period being served is the required minimum. The variable is the amount of
time the member has been assigned to the current location.
A25.6.3. If serving OS accompanied by command sponsored family members, a member may request
reassignment to the CONUS before DEROS if an unforeseen medical or educational requirement arises
after arrival at the OS base and reassignment under paragraph A25.6.2. is impractical. If the reassignment
request is based on inadequate medical or educational resources, the request must include the AF Form
1466 and the document, if other than the AF Form 1466, that approved family member travel to the
present location. NOTE: If the member caused or contributed to the commission of an AF Form 1466 vio-
lation, either by falsifying or omitting information which led to the approval of family member travel,
unless the member’s presence is absolutely essential for treatment, the family member should be returned
to the CONUS and the member will be required to complete the remainder of the OS tour established by
the original tour election.
A25.6.4. If selected for an OS long tour regardless of volunteer status, and family member travel is disap-
proved based on the unavailability of early intervention or related services and/or special educational ser-
vices, (see paragraph A25.2.) the member may seek release from the assignment. To do this, the member
must submit the appropriate abbreviated EFMP application reflected in Figure A25.2. to the AFPC Con-
tact Center within 7 calendar days of receipt of the disapproval of family member travel. A copy of the AF
Form 1466, MAJCOM/SG determination, and other supporting documentation disapproving family
member travel must be included as attachments to the request for assignment cancellation. However, if a
pinpointed assignment (a location with the required services) is identified by the MAJCOM/SG, and a
manning requirement exists at that location, a member selected as the most eligible nonvolunteer will be
required to proceed to the pinpointed assignment.
A25.6.5. If selected for an OS long tour as a nonvolunteer and family member travel is disapproved based
on the unavailability of general medical services (see paragraph A25.2.), a member may volunteer
through the AFPC Contact Center for an unaccompanied short tour in an effort to minimize family sepa-
ration. Use the appropriate abbreviated EFMP application reflected in Figure A25.2. If there are no cur-
rent or projected short tour requirements available, the unaccompanied long tour length must be served at
the projected OS location. After arrival OS, the existing condition will not be considered in support of a
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                 475


curtailment and early return to the CONUS unless the condition significantly worsens and the member’s
presence is considered essential.
A25.6.6. If selected as a volunteer for an OS long tour and family member travel is disapproved based on
the unavailability of general medical services, (see paragraph A25.2.) a member may request cancellation
of the assignment through the AFPC Contact Center. Use the appropriate abbreviated EFMP application
reflected in Figure A25.2. The request must include the documentation that denied family member travel.
Although approval of the request is not automatic, every effort will be made and consideration given to
approve such requests consistent with the needs of the Air Force.
A25.6.7. If selected as a nonvolunteer for an OS short tour to an area where family members are autho-
rized (for example, Guam, Azores, etc.), a member is required to serve the unaccompanied tour length
when family member OS travel is denied, regardless of the reason.
A25.6.8. If selected for an OS unaccompanied short tour (15 months or less), members may and are
encouraged to apply for a home-basing assignment (Attachment 5) to effect continuation of the estab-
lished EFMP. The request for home-basing should include trailer remarks that state the member is apply-
ing to effect continuation of an established EFMP. Those not selected for home-basing assignment may
request EFMP reassignment through the AFPC Contact Center to the same location as an OS returnee for
continuation of the established EFMP. Such a request must be submitted no earlier than the 10th month
and no later than the 8th month before DEROS.
A25.7. Reasons EFMP Requests are Usually Disapproved. HQ AFPC/DPAPO will not usually
approve requests for reassignment/deferment under the following circumstances:
A25.7.1. If the member caused or contributed to the commission of an AF Form 1466 violation, either by
falsifying or omitting information which led to the approval of family member travel. Unless the mem-
ber’s presence is absolutely essential, the family member should be returned to the CONUS and the mem-
ber must complete the OS tour length prescribed based on his or her status.
A25.7.1.1. Reassignment when the member initially elects and proceeds on the unaccompanied all-others
overseas tour at a location where family members are allowed and then, after arrival, desires to change to
an accompanied tour and the required medical or educational resources are not available to meet his fam-
ily member’s previously identified special needs.
A25.7.1.2. Reassignment when the member circumvents or disregards the family member clearance pro-
cess by bringing noncommand sponsored family members, at personal expense, to an overseas location
where the required medical resources do not exist to meet their known needs.
A25.7.2. Reassignment in order to establish a treatment program based on the availability of a preferred
or optimal program in an area other than where currently assigned when adequate facilities or services can
be, or are, provided within the current locale. Also, EFMP deferments are not granted for family members
to remain in a preferred or optimal program when adequate services are available within the projected
assignment locale.
A25.7.3. Reassignment for the purpose of obtaining extended family support.
A25.7.4. Reassignment based on the availability of a free or lower cost program in an area other than
where currently assigned when the current duty location can provide adequate services on base or through
the local community. EXCEPTION: When required services are being received off base and are causing
a significant financial hardship, a member can apply for reassignment as an exception to policy. Docu-
mentation provided with such a request must clearly document the hardship. This provision does not
476                                                  AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


apply to a dependent parent/parent-in-law since they are not eligible for coverage under Tricare (see
A25.7.11.).
A25.7.5. Reassignment based on the climatic conditions or geographical area adversely affecting a family
member’s health, and the problem is of a recurring nature (such as asthma, allergies, eczema, etc.).
EXCEPTION: Reassignment as an exception to policy can be requested if the continued presence of the
family member in such a climate/environment is medically determined to be clearly life threatening.
A25.7.6. The request is based on mental disorders (for example, anxieties, compulsions, obsessions, pho-
bias, and motor or sensory manifestations or combinations thereof) resulting from family separation inci-
dent to military assignment.
A25.7.7. A request based on an intellectually or athletically gifted child. Intellectually or athletically
gifted children do not qualify under the provisions of Public Law 95-561, Defense Dependents’ Education
Act of 1978, DoD instructions, and EFMP procedures.
A25.7.8. The family member is in an institution, unless institution officials certify frequent and regular
visits will be medically beneficial to the family member, or if admittance to or retention in the institution
requires establishing, continuing, or renewing state residency.
A25.7.9. The disability is due to a short-term illness or injury, or when the prognosis for complete recov-
ery is satisfactory without the benefit of reassignment or deferment.
A25.7.10. Reassignment from the CONUS to OS for the sole purpose of establishing a treatment program.
A25.7.11. A request for reassignment to a location with a greater capability to provide space available
care in a MTF for a member with a dependent parent/parent-in-law when the required care is available
within the current assignment locale.
A25.7.12. A request based on the medical condition of the Air Force member. (Assignment for this reason
is initiated by local medical authorities when it is determined the situation warrants such action.)
A25.7.13. Requests for deferment will not be considered for members who have not been selected and
notified of reassignment or TDY in excess of 30 days. A deferment request can be considered based on
the member’s appearance on the Vulnerable Mover List (VML) if coordination with the appropriate
assignment officer confirms assignment selection is highly likely.
A25.7.14. Deferment from reassignment when the required resources are available within the projected
assignment locale.
A25.8. Processing EFMP Requests.
A25.8.1. The final approval/disapproval authority is HQ AFPC/DPAPO. A request cannot be approved or
denied at a lower level.
A25.8.2. Submits the request through the AFPC Contact Center via the vMPF and faxes all required
endorsements and supporting documentation to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC. Large volume requests can be
mailed to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC, 550 C Street West, Suite B111, Randolph AFB TX 78150.
A25.8.2.1. Once the Contact Center receives the complete request, to include supporting documentation,
from the member, it must be forwarded to HQ AFPC/DPAPO within 1 workday.
A25.8.3. Forwarding endorsements and correspondence must include:
AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007                                                                   477


A25.8.3.1. Recommendation by commander to include additional information or evidence of material
value. If the commander recommends disapproval, complete justification must be provided. If the request
is based on a spouse’s inability to manage the household in the member’s absence due to unique family
situations (as defined in AFI 36-2908, Family Care Plans), the commander’s endorsement must include
information about the existence of (or lack thereof) of the documented family care plan required by AFI
36-2908. The commander's recommendation requirement is waived if the situation precludes the member
from obtaining it (request submitted while on leave, TDY, etc.). When applicable, the request must
include the reason for omitting the commander's recommendation.
A25.8.3.2. The local Special Needs Coordinator must review and provide input on all EFMP requests.
Input must address the availability of required resources within the current assignment locale.
A25.8.3.3. Requests for reassignment from members serving accompanied OS assignments that are based
on a lack of the medical, educational, related services, or early intervention services required by the fam-
ily member must include a copy of the AF Form 1466 and the document approving/disapproving family
member travel.
A25.8.3.4. Both parties of a military couple must submit a request if the same assignment consideration is
desired. Respective commander endorsements are required.
A25.9. Available Options When an Request is Disapproved. When a request is disapproved, the MPF
must counsel the member on the following options. Members may apply (if eligible) for retirement, retire-
ment under hardship conditions, hardship discharge, or (for officers) resignation or release from active
duty. For those who are pending reassignment a request under this paragraph must be submitted within 7
calendar days following receipt of the correspondence disapproving the request.
A25.10. Withdrawing a Request. If a member wants to withdraw his or her request before a final deci-
sion or departure on reassignment, the request must be submitted in writing to either the MPF or the
AFPC Contact Center, who in turn notifies HQ AFPC/DPAPO immediately. Once a member has departed
on an EFMP reassignment, the request can no longer be withdrawn.
A25.10.1. A request to withdraw an approved EFMP reassignment that was provided based on either a
lack of required medical resources within the current locale or on environmental factors that were having
a life threatening affect on a family member will not be favorably considered unless the situation has sig-
nificantly changed since initial approval.
A25.11. EFMP Assignment/TDY Restrictions.
A25.11.1. A member reassigned or deferred under the EFMP is placed in AAC 34 for 12 months as
directed by HQ AFPC/DPAPO. If granted a reassignment, members will not be reassigned PCS for at
least 12 months from date arrived station. A deferment will initially restrict members only from PCS for
a maximum of 12 months.
A25.11.2. TDY restriction does not automatically apply to EFMP requests unless specifically addressed
in approval correspondence from HQ AFPC/DPAPO. A member subject to TDY and requesting a restric-
tion must obtain a statement from the attending medical or therapy provider. The statement must specify
the need for the member’s presence and the duration of the requirement. This statement, along with a
request according to the example shown in Figure A25.1., are forwarded to the AFPC Contact Center. A
TDY restriction request is normally approved only on an initial EFMP request. When a TDY restriction is
requested and approved, the AFPC Contact Center will place the member in DAC 44 as directed by HQ
AFPC/DPAPO.
478                                                 AFI36-2110_AFDWSUP_I 17 DECEMBER 2007


A25.11.3. If a member’s parent organization is relocated or deactivated before expiration of the assign-
ment restriction, he or she is reported to the MAJCOM for intracommand reassignment to another organi-
zation on the same base. If no authorization for their specialty exists on base, or if the base is being
deactivated, the MAJCOM requests reassignment instructions from HQ AFPC/DPAPO.
A25.12. AF Form 1466, Request for Family Member’s Medical and Educational Clearance for
Travel.
A25.12.1. All members who have a family member enrolled in the EFMP (assignment limitation code
“Q”) must complete an AF Form 1466 upon selection for any PCS to a location family members are
allowed. The AF Form 1466 and other required documentation will be forwarded by the Special Needs
Coordinator (SNC) or Family Member Relocation Clearance (FMRC) Coordinator at the member’s cur-
rent duty location to the SNC/FMRC at the projected assignment location to determine if adequate facili-
ties will be available for the member’s exceptional family members. If family member travel is denied,
see paragraph A25.6.
A25.12.2. As mandated by Public Law, public schools and early intervention services are required to pro-
vide appropriate educational services. While mandated by law, the Air Force requires a member to pro-
cess the AF Form 1466 for a CONUS assignment even though the only need may be for special
educational, early intervention, or related services. A nonrecommendation for family member travel from
the gaining location’s Special Needs Coordinator will not result in cancellation of the assignment unless
requested by the member. However, if the member elects to continue with a CONUS assignment in this
situation, he or she may not later request EFMP reassignment based on a lack of services (unless the
request is based on a newly identified need).
A25.12.3. All requests for reassignment or tour curtailment will normally be disapproved when it is deter-
mined the member caused or contributed to the commission of an AF Form 1466 violation, either by fal-
sifying or omitting information. Unless the member’s presence is deemed essential, their family members
should be returned to the CONUS and the member will be required to complete the remainder of the OS
tour established by the original tour election.
A25.12.4. The AF Form 1466 investigation results will be provided to the losing and gaining commanders
by message for possible disciplinary action against a member who caused or contributed to the commis-
sion of an AF Form 1466 violation.
A25.13. Applicant Responsibilities.

endorsements and supporting documentation to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC. Large volume requests can be
mailed to HQ AFPC/DPFFCC, 550 C Street West, Suite B111, Randolph AFB TX 78150.
A25.13.2. A member stationed OS and requesting reassignment OS must agree to serve the prescribed
tour length at the new location or at least a tour length equal to the combined unaccompanied tour lengths
at the old and new locations, whichever is greater. FOR EXAMPLE: if you are serving on a 30/18 month
OS tour and receive approval for reassignment to a 36/24 month OS tour, you must serve the full pre-
scribed tour at the gaining location (36 months), or not less than a tour equal to the combined unaccompa-
nied tour lengths (18 plus 24, or 42 months) between the two OS locations before reassignment from the
theater, whichever is greater. The computation resulting in the greatest combined OS tour period being
served is the required minimum. The variable is the amount of time you have been assigned to the current
location.

are: (Give specific reasons why you cannot establish or continue the EFMP at the current or projected
location. If requesting a TDY restriction, justify why your presence is required and specify expected
duration. Give all relevant information.)
2. I have taken the following actions/steps to improve my worldwide availability: (Note: Information
concerning the existence of a viable family care plan according to AFI 36-2908 must be included in this
paragraph if the request is based on a spouse’s medical or emotional problems that make his or her ability
to manage the household questionable in your absence. Information addressing why a care plan was not
established or why an existing one is no longer viable is required.)
3. I submit the following supporting information:

4. I have (not) been previously (reassigned) (deferred) (TDY restricted) for EFMP reasons. If so, indicate
date and reason.
5. I understand my EFMP assignment will depend on manning requirements at the time I am available
for reassignment. If Air Force manning needs allow and required services are available, I prefer
reassignment to ______________________.
6. (Members serving OS.) If reassigned to another OS location within the same theater, I do (not)
volunteer to serve either the full accompanied tour length at the gaining location, or at least a tour length
equal to the combined unaccompanied tour lengths specified for the losing and gaining locations,
whichever is greater, prior to being reassigned from the oversea theater.
7. I do/do not have an active duty spouse. If so, I understand he/she must either submit a separate request
or sign this request. In either case, an endorsement from both commanders is required. I understand that
my spouse will not receive assignment/deferment consideration without the appropriate endorsements
and signatures.
8. (Airmen Only) (While retraining is not normally done on an EFMP request, it is sometimes
necessary.) I will (not) accept voluntary retraining (if necessary) for approval of my request. I understand
I will incur an assignment restriction due to my retraining. I also understand future assignment or
utilization in a previously held specialty will depend on Air Force manning requirements and that I may
be required to remain in the retraining AFSC for an indefinite period.
9. I understand if changes occur to the situation presented, whether prior to a final decision, my
departure, or after approval, I must advise either the Military Personnel Flight or AFPC Contact Center
immediately.

A27.3. (Added-AFDW) The IMT Process.
   A27.3.1. (Added-AFDW) All requests from assigned units to transfer Air Force members from their
   assigned unit to AFDW via the IMT Program shall be directed to AFDW/A1.
   A27.3.2. (Added-AFDW) Assigned units must follow up any verbal or informal requests (telephone,
   email, fax) by mailing a formal request, in writing, signed by the member’s commander or a senior
   level official, per Figure A27.1. (Added) to: AFDW/A1 (Attn: IMT Program Coordinator), 1535
   Command Drive, 3rd Floor DE Wing, Andrews AFB MD 20762.
   A27.3.3. (Added-AFDW) A decision to request transfer under the IMT Program is independent of
   any decision to impose UCMJ punishment; however, the underlying basis for taking any UCMJ action
   may be a factor in requesting IMT transfer.
   A27.3.4. (Added-AFDW) AFDW may deny a request for IMT if the member’s assigned unit fails to
   properly justify the need for the transfer or under other appropriate circumstances.
   A27.3.5. (Added-AFDW) Effect of Temporary Reassignments. For all temporary reassignments
   (“details”), the original assigned unit retains administrative responsibilities, such as performance
   reports, promotion recommendation forms, leave approvals, etc. All such actions will be coordinated
   with the gaining AFDW or subordinate unit supervisor.
   A27.3.6. (Added-AFDW) Effect of Permanent Reassignments. For all PCS/PCA actions to AFDW
   or its subordinate commands via PAS code/position, AFDW or the corresponding subordinate com-
   mand assumes full responsibility for the member. The original assigned unit will coordinate with the
   gaining unit supervisor regarding any pending personnel or other actions.
   A27.3.7. (Added-AFDW) Coordination.
      A27.3.7.1. (Added-AFDW) Requests received by AFDW subordinate command components in
      any medium (telephone, email, fax, original) will be immediately forwarded to AFDW/A1 (Attn:
      IMT Program Coordinator).
      A27.3.7.2. (Added-AFDW) Upon notification of a request for IMT, AFDW/A1 notifies 11 MSS/
      CC by encrypted email, for potential placement within 11 WG, regardless of whether the member
      will be attached or reassigned to the 11 WG.
      A27.3.7.3. (Added-AFDW) The 11 MSS/CC, in turn, notifies 11 WG/JA.
      A27.3.7.4. (Added-AFDW) The 11 WG/JA coordinates with the member’s assigned unit for
      additional information, and then contacts the appropriate law enforcement agency and AFCAF for
      follow up and action, as required.
      A27.3.7.5. (Added-AFDW) If appropriate, 11 W/JA makes a recommendation to 11 MSS/CC on
      Administrative Hold (“Admin Hold”) for the IMT member via an Admin Hold letter, provided to
      the Military Personnel Flight (MPF). The MPF places the IMT member on Admin Hold and com-
      pletes required update actions.
      A27.3.7.6. (Added-AFDW) The 11 WG/JA notifies 11 WG/CC about the potential IMT member.
      A27.3.7.7. (Added-AFDW) The 11 WG/JA up-channels information, as needed to AFDW/JA.
      AFDW/JA briefs AFDW/CC, as necessary, and consults with 11 WG/JA on investigative details.
      A27.3.7.8. (Added-AFDW) In the event that IMT placement in the 11 WG is not appropriate, 11
      MSS will coordinate with AFDW/A1, who will seek placement in another AFDW organization.

      A27.3.7.9. (Added-AFDW) Requests for IMT from assigned units need not be granted. AFDW/
      A1 may choose to not accept a member into the IMT Program when appropriate action can be
      completed by the assigned unit, where the assigned unit fails to properly justify transfer, or under
      other appropriate circumstances.
