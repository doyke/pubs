PART I:

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support
resources, and minimum requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a
clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of career field training. NOTE:
Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification
training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control training
within the career field.

   2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section
   A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career-field progression
   information, duties and responsibilities, training decisions, and career field path; Section C
   associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience,
   training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints. Some examples are funds,
   manpower, equipment, and facilities. Section E identifies transition training guide
   requirements for SSgt through MSgt.

   2.2. Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard
   (STS) to include duties, tasks, and technical references to support training, Air Education and
   Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course and core task, and
   correspondence course requirements. Section B contains the course objective list and training
   standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements. Section
   C identifies available support materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package
   (QTP) which may be developed to support proficiency training. Section D identifies a
   training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.
   Included here are both mandatory and optional courses, as well as exportable courseware.
   Section E identifies MAJCOM-unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine
   additional training required for the associated qualification needs. At unit level, supervisors
   and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the
   overall goals of this plan. Section F identifies tasks, training references, and training sources
   available in support of training conducted at the individual’s home station for
   contingency/wartime operations.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive
effective and efficient training at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable us to
train today’s workforce for tomorrow’s jobs.




                                                  4

consisting of instructional modules comprised of sharable content objectives in an
Internet/Intranet environment.

Advanced Training (AT) – A formal course which provides individuals who are qualified in
one or more positions of their AFS with additional skills/knowledge to enhance their expertise in
the career field. Training is for selected career Airmen at the advanced level of the AFS.

Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM) – An individual on the Air Staff or Forward
Operating Agency charged with the responsibility for overseeing all training and career field
management aspects of an Air Force specialty or group of specialties.

Air Force Job Qualification Standard/Command Job Qualification Standard
(AFJQS/CJQS) – A comprehensive task list that describes a particular job type or duty position.
Used by supervisors to document task qualifications. The tasks on AFJQS/CJQS are common to
all persons serving in the described duty position.

Air Force Qualification Training Package (AFQTP) – An instructional package for use at the
unit to qualify, or aid qualification, in a duty position, program, or on a piece of equipment.
AFQTPs identify the Air Force’s standardized method of performing the task. The AFQTP may
be printed (paper-based), computer-based, or in other audiovisual media.

Air Force Training Record (AFTR) – Web-based relational database used to track personnel’s
upgrade training requirements. (Formerly known as COVER Train)

Battlefield Airman – Airmen specifically identified as Battlefield Airmen perform tasks to
integrate and synchronize air and space operations in the deep or extended battlespace. These
airmen routinely fight with joint maneuver and special operations units.

Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) – A comprehensive, multipurpose
document encapsulating the entire spectrum of education and training for a career field. It
outlines a logical growth plan that includes training resources and is designed to make career
field training identifiable, to eliminate duplication, and to ensure this training is budget
defensible.

Certification and Testing (CerTest) – CerTest is an interactive computer-based program
designed to test, evaluate, and certify a student's knowledge of principles and procedures on
various job-related subjects. CerTest uses a variety of training materials and a computer program
that randomly selects test questions based on the instruction. This program will be moved to a
Learning Management System as the system becomes available.

Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) – Commercially procured training products.




                                               5

Section A - General Information

4. Purpose of the CFETP. This CFETP provides information necessary for Air Force Career
Field Managers (AFCFMs), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, education
and training managers, supervisors, trainers and certifiers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct
an effective career field training program. This plan outlines the training that individuals in the
AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career. It identifies initial
skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training. Initial skills training; this is
the AFS-specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining
into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level. Normally, AETC conducts this training at one
of the technical training centers. Upgrade training; this identifies the mandatory courses, task
qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the
3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels. Qualification training; this is actual hands-on task performance
training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs
both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance
skills and knowledge required to do the job. Advanced training; this is a formal course that
provides individuals who are qualified in one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty
(AFS) with additional skills and knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field.
Training is for selected career Airmen at the advanced level of the AFS. Proficiency training;
this is additional training, either in-residence, exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-
job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum
requirements for upgrade. The CFETP has several purposes. These purposes are:

   4.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field
   training program. It is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an
   individual’s career.

   4.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty
   and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.

   4.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty and identifies sources of training and
   training delivery methods.

   4.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired
   career field training process.

5. Uses of the CFETP. MFMs and supervisors will use the plan at all levels to ensure
comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

   5.1. AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, nonresident, field, and
   exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II
   of the CFETP. They will also work with the AFCFM, Air Force Civil Engineer Support
   Agency Force Development Division (HQ AFCESA/CEOF) to develop acquisition strategies
   for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.




                                                10
   5.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
   upgrade, and proficiency requirements and identify requirements that can be satisfied by OJT,
   resident training, contract training, CerTest, or exportable courses. MAJCOM developed
   training to support this AFS must be identified for inclusion into the plan.

   5.3. Unit Education and Training managers and supervisors must ensure each individual
   completes the mandatory training requirements (including MAJCOM supplemental
   requirements) for the upgrade training specified in this plan.

   5.4. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.
   The lists of courses in Part II in this CFETP will be used as a reference to support training.

6. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority for the CFETP.
MAJCOM representatives and AETC personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field
training requirements. The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure
currency and accuracy. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

9. Training Decisions: The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Engineering career field. The
spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The
strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a
disjointed approach to training. The following training decisions were made by members of the
21-25 July 2008, Utilization and Training Workshop (U&TW) held at Ft Leonard Wood, MO:

  9.1. Initial Skills Training. The 3-level apprentice course was reviewed for content.
  Additions, deletions, and modifications were made to the course using Mission Ready Airman
  (CRA) as the guiding criteria. Wartime training tasks were identified and validated.

  9.2. Five Level Upgrade Training Requirements. Existing CDCs were reviewed and
  verified to ensure only current material remained and new technology information was added.

  9.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training Requirements. The 7-level craftsman course
  requirements were reviewed. It was determined that an in-residence course was still required.

  9.4. Proficiency Training. Any additional knowledge and skill requirements that were not
  taught through initial skills or upgrade training are assigned as continuation training. The
  purpose of continuation training is to provide training exceeding minimum upgrade training
  requirements with emphasis on present and future duty positions. MAJCOMs must develop a
  continuation training program that ensures personnel in the Engineering career field receive
  the necessary training at the appropriate point in their career. The training program will
  identify both mandatory and optional training requirements.

  9.5. Supplemental Training. Subject Matter Experts (SME) and the Training Committee
  reviewed supplemental training courses for technical accuracy and identified training was still
  adequate and required.

  9.6. CerTest. Originally, the CerTest program was developed to support transition training
  and meet DoD certification requirements. Now, it is also the singular platform to launch
  AFQTP tests and supplement the evaluation of OJT.

10. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Airmen are automatically enrolled in
CCAF upon completion of basic military training. CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an
Associate in Applied Sciences Degree. In addition to its associate’s degree program, CCAF
offers the following:

  10.1. Occupational Instructor Certification. The instructor must be a full-time instructor
  teaching a CCAF course at an affiliated school at the time of nomination. Additionally,
  instructors should: hold an associate or higher degree from an accredited institution, complete
  a Teaching Internship of 12 semester hours, complete an Instructor Methodology course of at
  least three semester hours. Have two years teaching experience as a CCAF instructor from the


                                              15
    date assigned instructor duties. Hold the journeyman (5-skill level) or higher (or fully
    qualified equivalent) in an AFS, and be recommended for certification by the affiliate school
    commander, commandant, or equivalent designated representative. The certification is
    awarded after completing the instructor methods course, supervised practice teaching and
    requirements listed above.

    10.2. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill
    certification is awarded for the primary occupational specialty. The College uses a
    competency-based assessment process for trade skill certification at one of four proficiency
    levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman (Supervisor), or Master Craftsman (Manager).
    All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.

11. The Construction Technology Associates Degree (4VEB) applies to AFSC 3E5X1.

    11.1. Degree requirements. Prior to completing an Associates Degree, the individual must
    be awarded a 5-level and the following requirements must be met: Leadership, management
    and military studies; physical education; general education; and program electives. Program
    elective requirements are identical for all programs. A student must complete all degree
    requirements before separating, retiring, or becoming a commissioned officer. Degree
    program consists of a minimum of 64 semester hours with requirements typically as follows:

                                      CE Badge Heraldry
The gear wheel and compass have historically been used to represent the engineering
profession, in both the military and civilian sector. The gear represents the essence of
engineering: applying scientific principles and technology to practical ends. To Air Force
engineers, the gear symbolizes an element (representing the built environment) that meshes
with other environments (weapon systems and trained personnel) to enable the Air Force to
perform its mission. The compass is a precision tool historically used by engineers in
designing and constructing facilities and equipment. The gear and compass together
symbolize all the diverse specialties within Air Force Civil Engineer. Finally, the wings help
to portray the fundamental linkage between the engineering and aviation components; and that
the built environment is the foundation supporting Air Force mission and people.

PART II

Section A - Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for the
Engineering Apprentice Course with class beginning 21 Jan 2011 and graduating 16 Feb 2011.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, and this STS:

  2.1. Lists in Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References(TR)) the most common
  tasks, knowledge, and TR necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill
  level.

  2.2. Lists in Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training
  requirements) by an asterisk (*) in the appropriate skill level sub-column. As a minimum,
  trainees must complete all core and critical tasks for skill level upgrade.

  2.3. All tasks in the 3-level course column are considered wartime tasks. Consequently, in
  response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a
  streamlined training environment.

  2.4. Tasks identified by a diamond () are considered contingency/war tasks and are critical
  to the career field. Equipment shortfalls at most locations have created problems with the
  actual hands-on certification of these tasks. In instances where required equipment is not
  available for instruction, completion of the task’s AFQTP and passing the corresponding
  CerTest (if developed) is all that is required for upgrade and qualification training.

  2.5. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of task and
  knowledge training requirements. The CE CFM’s approved automated training record AFTR
  (Air Force Training Record) must be used to document technician qualifications. Task
  certification must show a training completion date and initials of the trainee, trainer, and
  certifier. All non-core tasks require training completion date and initials of the trainee and
  trainer only.

  2.6. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the
  proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task
  and knowledge and the career knowledge provided by formal courses, CDCs, ADL, and
  AFQTPs.

  2.7. Identifies qualitative requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key
  used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by ADL, resident training, and
  career development courses.

  2.8. Becomes a JQS for OJT training when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training
  Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201. For OJT, the tasks in Column 1 are trained and
  qualified to the go/no go level. Go means the individual can perform the task without



                                              30
assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of
procedures. AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized
procedures. When used as a JQS, the following documentation applies:

  2.8.1. Identify current duty position requirements by circling the subparagraph number
  or letter next to the task statement. Additionally, all core and diamond () identified
  tasks should be circled. Document task completion by annotating columns 3A, 3B, 3C,
  3D and 3E, as appropriate. Note: All entries shall be made in pencil.

  2.8.2. Enter the start date of the AFQTP on the AFQTP documentation record. Once
  completed enter the completion date. When hands-on training is started and completed,
  annotate the STS accordingly.

  2.8.3. Transcribing from old document (paper or automated) to CFETP. Use the new
  STS to identify and certify all current and past task qualifications.

     2.8.3.1. For tasks previously certified and still required in the current duty position:

        2.8.3.1.1. For core and critical tasks, the trainer and certifier evaluates airman’s
        current qualifications and validates airman’s ability to complete the task. The
        certifier and trainee then enter their initials and new certified date.

        2.8.3.1.2. For non-core duty position tasks, the trainer evaluates the Airman's
        current qualifications and validates the Airman's ability to complete the task. The
        current date is entered in column 3B and the trainee and trainer enter their initials in
        columns 3C and 3D, respectively.

        2.8.3.1.3. Annotate the AF Form 623a, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation
        Sheet, (for example, "I certify the information contained in the CFETP dated XX was
        transcribed to the CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given the superseded
        CFETP." Supervisor and trainee sign and date the statement).

     2.8.3.2. To transcribe previous certification for tasks not required in the current duty
     position, carry forward only the previous completion dates (not the initials of another
     person). If and when these tasks become a duty position requirement, recertify with
     current date and trainee, trainer and certifier’s initials.

  2.8.4. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the supervisor
  identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge in
  accordance with (IAW) 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and ensures, as a minimum,
  that trainees cover all mandatory items specified in AFI 36-2101. For two-time CDC exam
  failures, the unit commander will take appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2201. Note:
  Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.

  2.8.5. Decertification and Recertification. . When an airman is found to be unqualified
  on a task, the supervisor shall erase previous certification and enter airman into
  qualification training. Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623a, as to the


                                             31
     reason for decertification. The individual is recertified using the normal certification
     process.

  2.7. The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman
  Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF
  Occupational Measurement Squadron by SNCOs with extensive practical experience in their
  career field. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test
  development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions
  are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in
  Chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System. WAPS is not
  applicable to the ARC personnel.

3. Recommendations. Comments and recommendations are invited concerning quality of
AETC training. Reference this STS and address correspondence regarding changes to 782
TRG/TGAV, 620 9th Avenue, Suite 3, Sheppard AFB TX 76311-2368. A customer service

Explanations
* A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific
task. (Example: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or
for a subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

X This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.

 - Contingency/war tasks are critical to the career field.

 NOTE: All tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are trained during wartime.

NOTE 1: Diamond tasks are extremely important to the career field. Diamond tasks are the same as core tasks
with one exception--equipment shortfalls at most locations have created problems with the actual hands-on
certification of these tasks. In instances where required equipment is not available for instruction, completion of
the task’s AFQTP and passing the corresponding CerTest (if applicable) is all that is required for upgrade and
qualification training. Hands-on certification should be accomplished at the first opportunity when equipment is
available. In locations where the equipment is available for hands-on certification, CerTest completion is still a
mandatory requirement.
NOTE 2: AFCESA is in the process of transferring all courses on CD-ROM to the new AFCESA Civil Engineer
Virtual Learning Center (CE-VLC). Once completed the CerTest for the applicable diamond task will be
available online.

Section B - Course Objective List (Col)
(This section used when developing lesson plans)

4. Measurement. Measurement of each objective is indicated as follows:

  4.1. Written Test (W) - used to sample each knowledge objective and the knowledge
  components of performance objectives.

  4.2. Performance Test (P) - used under specified conditions in a formal testing mode to
  measure student accomplishment of performance objectives after the teaching-learning
  activity has been completed.

  4.3. Progress Checks (PC) - administered by the instructor during classroom or laboratory
  instruction time to assess the student’s accomplishment of knowledge or performance
  objectives.

5. Standard. The standard is 70% on written examinations. Standards for performance
measurement are indicated in the objectives and delineated on the individual progress checklist.
Instructor assistance may be provided as stated during the progress check, and students may be
required to repeat all or parts of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.

6. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which
means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of
the task (partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing
the task.

7. Course Objective List. These objectives are listed in the sequence taught by Block of
Instruction.

  7.1. Initial Skills Course. A detailed listing of the initial skills course objectives may be
  obtained by written request to 366 TRS/DO, 727 Missile Road, Sheppard AFB TX 76311-
  2254.

  7.2. 7-Skill Level Course. A detailed listing of the Engineering Craftsman course objectives
  may be obtained by written request to AFCESA.


Section C - Support Materials

8. CerTest.

  8.1. Air Force Qualification Training Packages. An instructional package designed for
  trainees to qualify on core or diamond tasks. AFQTPs are the standardized method for
  performing the task. The AFQTP may be printed (paper-based), computer-based, or in other
  audiovisual media. See the AFCESA web pages for up-to-date AFQTPs at: HQ
  AFCESA/CEOM portal website



                                               49
  8.2. CerTest

     8.2.1. CerTest, a computer-based evaluation program ensures skilled craftsmen are
     available to meet the Air Force’s changing needs. It enhances OJT and QT training by
     testing and evaluating an individual's knowledge of the principles and procedures in each
     specialty.

        8.2.1.1. CerTest contains tests used to evaluate task knowledge received through
        different media such as: paper products, videotapes, and computer–based programs.

        8.2.1.2. The CerTest program contains mandatory tests, required for upgrade. All
        diamond () coded tasks on the STS have a corresponding mandatory CerTest.

        8.2.1.3. CerTest is also a powerful training management tool. It can be used to find the
        strengths and weaknesses in an individual's training and experience. CerTest
        automatically records and updates all test results. The training manager can copy
        records to a disk so that an individual can bring current, accurate training information
        to a new unit; thereby helping the gaining supervisor evaluate the trainee's knowledge
        and experience.

  8.3. CerTest also enables unit personnel to develop site-specific tests. These custom-made
  tests standardize testing on tasks unique to a specific duty station and/or assignment. The
  program contains a graphics library that may be used along with a menu-driven test editor to
  develop these site-specific tests.

  8.4. CerTest also contains optional CDC pre-evaluation tools. Volume review exercises are
  available for progress checks after each volume is completed. After all volumes are
  completed in a set, the trainee may take the course review exercise before taking the final
  End of Course exam at the base training office. Commanders are encouraged to integrate
  these tools in their unit’s OJT program.

  8.5. CerTest is the CE platform for electronic CDC testing. Currently, all CE AFSs are
  allowed to use AFIADL’s (http://www.au.af.mil/au/afiadl/) CerTest on installations where Base
  Test Control Facilities (TCFs) are equipped. See your UETM for further information.

  8.6. The mandatory AFQTP CerTests are listed in each AFQTP, if required.

Section F - Home Station Training

16. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to identify the tasks, training references, and
training sources available in support of contingency/wartime training. Prime BEEF forces will
train to meet the full range of tasks expected in the contingency environment. Training ranges
from knowledge-type training conducted in a classroom, to task-oriented hands-on training
conducted in the field. These training requirements, frequencies, and sources are listed in AFI
10-210, Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force (BEEF) Program.

  16.1. HST Definition. . HST is training that is conducted at the individual’s home station
  for contingency operations. The CE commander ensures training is provided and documented
  and arranges for subject matter experts to conduct training as required. HST requirements are
  identified in AFI 10-210, Attachments 2 and 3.

     16.1.1. Prime BEEF Orientation/General Contingency. Upon assignment to the unit,
     all military and emergency-essential civilian employees will be trained on the unit’s Prime
     BEEF and Emergency Management missions.                 The training will emphasize the
     individual’s role and how he or she fits into the program. It will also include an overview
     of Civil Engineer Doctrine and explain the organization, training, equipment, operating
     concepts, and contingency missions pertaining to the unit.

        16.1.1.1. Combat Skills Training (CST). CST must be institutionalized as an integral
        part of any HST program. Lessons learned from operations such as IRAQI FREEDOM
        have taught us the importance of maintaining a higher level of combat readiness.
        Although the inclusion of combat skills-focused training into HST does not fully
        prepare CE personnel to work in a high threat combat environment, the steps taken to
        enhance training will help elevate units to a readiness level capable of supporting safe
        and effective operations in low to medium risk combat environments.

        16.1.1.2. Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEETS). Wartime or contingency
        environments often involve the use of specialized and unique mission-essential
        equipment that civil engineers do not use in their day-to-day operations. Due to the cost
        and complexity, mission essential contingency equipment and trainer expertise are not
        commonly found at Continental United States (CONUS) installations. Personnel must
        be hands-on certified and the certification documented in their CFETP. AFI 10-210
        identifies minimum personnel to be trained, positions by specialty, frequencies and
        locations of training sites. Inadequate training on these key equipment items can
        negatively impact Air Force contingency operations.

     16.1.2. Silver Flag Training. Silver Flag Exercise Sites are located at Tyndall AFB, FL;
     Ramstein AB, Germany; Kadena AB, Japan. They conduct training with their major focus
     on students being able to perform critical contingency task in a team environment. The
     training focuses on bare base beddown and sustainment operations using hands-on training
     with basic expeditionary airfield resources (BEAR) equipment in a realistic beddown
     environment. Where possible, combat skills training has been added to the curriculum to



                                              53
  ensure realism and help fortify combat skills mentality amongst teams. All CE personnel
  who fill Unit Type Code (UTC) positions will receive team training at Silver Flag Exercise
  Sites with the exception of members on headquarters staff augmentation UTCs, pavement
  evaluation UTCs, and generator repair and maintenance UTCs.

16.2. Training References.

  16.2.1. AFI 10-210. AFI 10-210 identifies the Prime BEEF recurring training
  requirements. You can review this document by going to the Air Force publications web
  site.

  16.2.2. AFPAM 10-219 Series. These publications assist in home station training and
  contingency responses.

  16.2.3. AFH 10-222 Series. These publications provide expeditionary engineer craftsman
  “how to” operating and maintenance procedures.

  16.2.4. AETC Courses. AETC conducts formal contingency training courses on subjects
  such as bare base equipment, air base combat engineering, and readiness management. For
  course descriptions, refer to the ETCA website: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.

  16.2.5. Web-based Products. Web-based products are available on the CE Virtual
  Learning Center (VLC) website at: https://afcesa.csd.disa.mil/kc/login/login.asp.
  Personnel completing these courses can receive credit for training. Computer based
  training (CBT) products can be used in a classroom setting to train as many personnel as
  possible. Attendance must be documented on a sign-in roster. The sign-in roster must be
  maintained IAW AFI 10-210.

  16.2.6. HQ AFCESA/CEX. Maintains a comprehensive listing of training products that
  support the contingency training program.

  16.2.7. Ancillary Training. AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, describes
  ancillary training as guidance or instruction that contributes to mission accomplishment.
  For a full list of mandatory ancillary training requirements go to the ETCA website (see
  paragraph 14.2.4).

  16.2.8. Deployment Support Training. AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and
  Execution, describes deployment support training requirements. Deployment support
  training is mandatory training that will aid a unit in preparing to deploy/redeploy.
