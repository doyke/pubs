                                           Chapter 1

             GENERAL CONCEPTS, POLICIES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Concept. The AFGSC CCIR reporting system provides the AFGSC commander and
intermediate commanders the information necessary for timely operational decisions. The main
criterion for inclusion into the AFGSC CCIR reporting system is essential information for
command and control of nuclear forces.
1.2. Purpose. The CCIR report ensures events/incidents that do not meet Air Force Operational
Reporting (AF OPREP-3) requirements are still available to the USSTRATCOM, AFGSC,
Numbered Air Force (NAF) commanders and applicable Task Force (TF). CCIRs can be used to
notify Headquarters Air Force (HAF) if the situation warrants higher attention or if the
preliminary information leads to an AF OPREP-3.
1.3. Policy. Units at all levels will develop procedures to quickly obtain and report the key
elements of an AFGSC CCIR report. Installations hosting units assigned to different MAJCOMs
will develop host/tenant responsibilities in a Host Tenant Support Agreement (HTSA) and/or
Memorandum of Understanding/Agreement (MOU/A). Each affected MAJCOM will coordinate
on the MOU/A and review annually or as mission changes dictate. Geographically Separated
Units will comply with parent MAJCOM guidance IAW this instruction. (T-2).
1.4. Responsibilities.
     1.4.1. AFGSC Command Post (CP) Policy and Procedures will:
        1.4.1.1. Develop and provide AFGSC CCIR reporting guidance by incorporating
        AFGSC CCIRs, TF Job Aids, EAP-STRAT Vol 12 and OPORD Global Citadel.
        1.4.1.2. Review information within this instruction annually, or at A3 direction to
        determine operational necessity. CP will be notified of changes (through CP channels) as
        directed.
        1.4.1.3. Update the AFGSC CCIR Reports Matrix, as directed by the USSTRATCOM
        CDR/DCR, CV, J38 or AFGSC/CC, CV or A3. Distribute the matrix as an AFGSC
        Controller Information File (CIF). The matrix will remain in effect until superseded or
        rescinded.
        1.4.1.4. Develop AFGSC Core Compliance criteria/checklists for evaluating compliance
        with published directives.
        1.4.1.5. Conduct Staff Assistance Visits to review unit programs and procedures.
     1.4.2. AFGSC Command Center will:
        1.4.2.1. Be the subject matter experts for CCIR processing.
        1.4.2.2. Receive and process information from reporting units to AFGSC staff agencies.
        1.4.2.3. Distribute data to requesting AFGSC leadership and affected COCOM and/or
        MAJCOMs (as applicable).
        1.4.2.4. Review received reports for accuracy, correctness and information that warrants
        HAF notification or operational reporting.
AFGSCI10-500 8 JANUARY 2014                                                                    5


      1.4.2.5. Ensure processes are in place to train/familiarize MAJCOM Personnel (at a
      minimum the AFGSC/CC, CV, A3, Deputy A3, First Sergeant) on OPREP-3/CCIR
      processes and requirements.
   1.4.3. NAF Command Posts/ Operations Centers will:
      1.4.3.1. Ensure procedures are in place to notify NAF leadership and applicable TF of all
      reportable incidents/events.
      1.4.3.2. Monitor Defense Connect Online (DCO) Jabber Chat and SKIWeb 24/7.
      Acknowledge, on behalf of the NAF and/or applicable TF (as stated in HTSA/MOU/A),
      when their respective units post in DCO Jabber Chat and SKIWeb.
      1.4.3.3. Ensure training is IAW section 1.5 of this instruction.
   1.4.4. Wing/Unit CP will:
      1.4.4.1. Refer to this instruction as an “all in one” document to meet USSTRATCOM,
      AFGSC, NAF and TF reporting requirements. However, maintain copies of applicable
      Job Aids, EAP-STRAT Vol 12, and OPORD Global Citadel within the console area for
      reference and notifications as needed.
      1.4.4.2. Appoint in writing a primary and alternate Command Post NCOIC, Reports (T-
      3). The Command Post NCOIC, Reports will be referred to as the Reports manager
      throughout the duration of this instruction.
      1.4.4.3. Provide commanders the necessary information to facilitate an informed
      decision and submit timely reports using the AFGSC CCIR Reports Matrix.
      1.4.4.4. Ensure installation/wing commanders are informed of all AFGSC CCIR
      incidents reported by a tenant organization. Submission of reports will not be delayed to
      provide notification of commanders.
      1.4.4.5. Maintain a current copy of all AFGSC CCIR reporting HTSAs/MOU/As.
      1.4.4.6. Outline AFGSC CCIR responsibilities of host and tenant CP units (e.g., 1C3s
      functioning as a CP entity). Define individuals with responsibility for submitting reports,
      procedures based on operational control, and emphasize importance of timely and
      accurate reports.
      1.4.4.7. Provide copies of HTSAs/MOU/As to the host and tenant MAJCOMs. AFGSC
      will maintain a current copy of the agreement on file.
      1.4.4.8. Ensure that all certified controllers have active DCO Jabber Chat,
      NIPRNet/SIPRNet Microsoft Outlook e-mail and SKIWeb accounts to submit AFGSC
      CCIR synchronous and asynchronous reports IAW this instruction.

                        GENERAL REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS

2.1. Security Classification and Downgrading Instructions. AFI 31-401, Information
Security Program Management, provides security classification and downgrading instructions.
   2.1.1. Classify AFGSC CCIR reports according to content. Reports containing any of the
   following information will be classified SECRET (at a minimum) (T-0):
       2.1.1.1. Indicators of unit readiness data. See AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and
       Training System, for further guidance.
       2.1.1.2. Unit mission essential tasks as captured in Defense Readiness Reporting System.
       2.1.1.3. Information on the deployment of combat aircraft, units, or personnel, according
       to the appropriately classified deployment plans.
       2.1.1.4. Events/incidents of confirmed or suspected compromise of classified

                                           Chapter 3

                  EVENT/INCIDENT REPORT (AFGSC CCIR REPORT)

3.1. Subject and Purpose. AFGSC installation commanders use AFGSC CCIR reporting to
immediately notify headquarters of any significant event or incident that rises to the level of
MAJCOM or COCOM interest. CPs will submit the applicable AFGSC CCIR report regardless
of whether or not the event is being reported through other channels (T-0). AFGSC CCIR
reports do not replace the requirement for more detailed reports such as the Commander's
Situation Report, and other directorate accident or incident investigation reports. Submitting an
AFGSC CCIR report does not change nor is a substitute for any report required by other
directives. Real-world AFGSC CCIR reports take priority over exercise events.
3.2. Reporting Categories. EAP STRAT Vol 12 and OPORD Global Citadel, categorizes
events or incidents to be reported along with AFGSC CCIRs and TF Job Aids (i.e., DULL
SWORD, Nuclear Current Operations Duty Officer (NCODO), Non-Operational reports, etc.).
See Chapter 4 for categories.
3.3. Reports Guidebook. It is the responsibility of the reports manager to maintain the reports
guidebook. This guide provides a quick reference to assist CP controllers in submitting AFGSC
CCIRs and other reports, as applicable.
     3.3.1. The reports guidebook will include the following (as a minimum):
        3.3.1.1. Section I. Checklists containing step-by-step procedures to ensure required
        reports are submitted in the proper format, within established timelines, and with the
        correct content.
        3.3.1.2. Section II. Content guide for AFGSC CCIR event/incident reporting. The
        AFGSC CCIR Content Guide, Attachment 3, is a list of minimum routine questions that
        need to be answered when including data into a CCIR report.
        3.3.1.3. Section III. Current AFGSC CCIR Reports Matrix. The AFGSC CCIR Reports
        Matrix is a quick reference guide to assist commanders and controllers in determining the
        type of report to submit based on events and incidents deemed of interest to the AFGSC,
        NAF, applicable TF and USSTRATCOM Commanders.
        3.3.1.4. Section IV. Record review, appointment letter, synchronous/asynchronous
        templates and examples for reference, AFGSC CCIR Reports incoming/outgoing
        message log, commander training documentation (T-3).
     3.3.2. The reports manager will review the Reports Guidebook semi-annually. The reports
     manager will conduct and document a weekly review of all sent reports for content and
     accuracy. Controllers will be back-briefed on any errors identified at monthly training
     meetings. Checklists, templates, matrixes, etc. will be reviewed and updated, as necessary.
     Document the review on AF Form 4436, Command Post Publications Review Log.
3.4. AFGSC CCIR Report Timing Requirements. CPs must submit synchronous (initial
notification) reports via Defense Connect Online (DCO) Jabber Chat within 15 minutes of CP
notification (T-1). CPs must submit asynchronous (record copy) reports within 1 hour of Jabber
Chat notification approval (T-1).
AFGSCI10-500 8 JANUARY 2014                                                                       9


3.5. Report Construction. Units should develop processes that enable the correct and
expedient transmission of reports via synchronous, asynchronous, and alternate means of
communication. Synchronous Reports are transmitted via the SIPRNet DCO Chat Client, more
commonly known and referred to as “Jabber”. Jabber notification procedures are outlined in
Para 3.6. and 3.8. Asynchronous reports are transmitted via a SIPRNet blog site referred to as
SKIWeb. SKIWeb notification procedures are outlined in Para 3.7 and 3.8 See Attachment 5
and Attachment 6 for report examples.
   3.5.1. CCIR Message Subject Line. Regardless of transmission medium, all CCIR subject
   lines will be constructed in the following manner:
       3.5.1.1. Portion Marking. All subject lines will contain a portion marking for the
       classification of the subject line (U, C, S, S/NF, etc.). This is not to identify the overall
       classification of the report (T-0).
       3.5.1.2. MAJCOM Affiliation (AFGSC).
       3.5.1.3. Type of Report (CCIR).
       3.5.1.4. Date Time Group of Incident. This time should be when the incident occurred.
       Do not use the Time of Command Post notification in the subject line; this can be
       elaborated on in the report text. The DTG will not change as subsequent reports are
       submitted.
       3.5.1.5. Location Event Occurred. The location the incident or where the event took
       place. This may not be the same location as a military installation. Do not narrow the
       location beyond or below city/base level.
          3.5.1.5.1. For events/incidents that occur in multiple locations use the base name
          (e.g., missile squadrons that span across multiple states or cities).
       3.5.1.6. Event/Incident and Rule Number. Used to identify the incident listed in CCIR
       Matrix and the associated rule number.
       3.5.1.7. Subject Line Example:
          3.5.1.7.1. (U) AFGSC CCIR, DDHHMMZMONYYYY, Minot AFB, ND, Dropped
          Objects, Rule A4
   3.5.2. Report body or event text (SKIWeb). The first AFGSC CCIR record copy report will
   include the time the CP was notified (e.g., “CP was notified at 131200ZSEP2012”). The
   body of the report narrative will include the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the
   incident. In the initial report, include what is known at the time. Add new information as
   details unfold. In subsequent reports, do not restate previously stated facts. (T-1).
       3.5.2.1. The statement “Further reporting through XXX channels” will only be used after
       consulting and confirming with the appropriate external agency(ies) that further reports
       will be accomplished through their channels. Include the appropriate agency office
       symbol and contact number, as applicable. This statement will not be used as a blanket
       statement.
       3.5.2.2. For all Final reports, add the word “CLOSED” at the end of the subject line.
       Reports will also end with the following statement, “No further information will be
       provided through AFGSC CCIR channels”.
 10                                                           AFGSCI10-500 8 JANUARY 2014


        3.5.2.3. When events/incidents occur which overlap multiple rule numbers, units will
        combine them and submit one CCIR (T-1). For CCIRs with multiple rule numbers, only
        one rule number and title will be reflected in the subject line; use the most severe incident
        in the subject line and identify additional rule numbers at the end of the Event Detail
        section of the synchronous/asynchronous report (i.e., Rules XX, XX and XX also apply)
        (T-1).
              3.5.2.3.1. For example, use Bomb Threat – Rule D1, in the subject line for the
              following scenario: Bomb Threat; Unexploded Ordnance (UXO); Criminal Activity.
              Additional rule numbers will be reflected at the bottom of the
              synchronous/asynchronous report, (i.e., Rules XX, XX and XX also apply).
        3.5.2.4. Mission Impact/Impairment (if applicable). This section of the report should
        identify how the event or incident impacts the wing/units mission (individual squadron
        impact is not required). Use N/A for reports that do not impact unit’s mission.
        3.5.2.5. Estimated time in commission (ETIC): Identify the estimated time a situation
        will end, a weapon system is expected to return to service, or repair will be complete.
        Use N/A for reports that do not require an ETIC.
        3.5.2.6. Point of Contact (POC). This is used after consulting and confirming with the
        appropriate external agency/agencies and informing them that further reports will be
        accomplished through their channels, include agency office symbol and 7-digit DSN.
        POCs will only be listed for Final and Initial/Final Reports. For all other report types
        (e.g. Initial/Follow Up/Correction), “N/A” will be used. Inclusion of POC information
        will be at the discretion of the reporting unit/wing unless directed by AFGSC Command
        Center; based upon report type, content, etc.
        3.5.2.7. Portion Marking. All sections within the report body will contain portion
        markings if the classification of the subject line is anything other than “U” or
        “U//FOUO” (T-0). These portion markings do not identify the overall classification of
        the report, but rather the classification of the section it is placed in front of.

Table 3.1. Report Body Example.
(U) Initial

(U) Event Detail: The CP was notified at 251458ZDEC2014 of a B-1B, C/S Chester 1, T/N 69-
2008 crashing midfield on Runway (RWY) 01 at Barksdale AFB, LA. The aircraft was carrying
conventional weapons which are scattered across both RWY 01 and 02. The Airfield is closed
UFN. Three Crew members were transported to LSU Medical Center in Shreveport, LA for
treatment, status is unknown. Media Attention has occurred. Rule B1 also applies.

(S) Mission Impact: All flying cancelled UFN. The Bomb Wing was scheduled to deploy in
support of exercise Golden Flow. Nine training sorties have been cancelled to date.

(U) ETIC: RWY Ops are expected to resume on 291500ZDEC2014.

(U) POC: N/A
AFGSCI10-500 8 JANUARY 2014                                                                       11


NOTE: The information in this example is UNCLASSIFIED, regardless of portion markings.
   3.5.3. Initial and Initial/Final reports. Initial and Initial/Final reports should contain as much
   information as immediately available within established time parameters about an event or
   incident. Both reports will be submitted IAW Para 3.5 An Initial report may only be
   submitted as an Initial/Final report if it contains all of the required information to close the
   report. The AFGSC Command Center will ask questions during initial reporting to get
   clarification and/or prompt units to get information required by HHQ to post in the record
   copy or follow up reports. Information requested by AF Watch, AFGSC Command Center,
   and/or JS during synchronous reporting will be provided in an asynchronous report when the
   information becomes available (T-1). Both reports are posted in Jabber prior to posting in
   SKIWeb (T-1).
3.6. Synchronous Reports. Synchronous means communication where all parties involved in
the communication are present at the same time (i.e., a telephone conversation, a chat room event
and instant messaging). Units will submit a synchronous report using SIPRNet Jabber for all
Initial, Follow Up, Final, Correction, and Initial/Final AFGSC CCIR reports. Do not delay the
initial Jabber notification to obtain additional information. The initial Jabber notification time
will be the time entered into the system. Use Follow Up notifications and reporting to provide
additional information as it becomes available. AFGSC Command Center will assess unit
reports for possible higher category reporting requirements.
   3.6.1. Units submitting an AFGSC CCIR Jabber report will enter the following notifications
   into the “AF Global Strike Command” chat room. See Attachment 5 for Jabber notification
   example (T-3). Units will be logged in to Jabber as “Unit/Base Name (Rank/Name)” (T-3).
   3.6.2. AFGSC units will monitor both Jabber (AFGSC Command Center, AF Watch,
   NMCC, USSTRATCOM GOC and applicable Task Forces) and SKIWeb 24/7.
   3.6.3. AFGSC Command Center will acknowledge wing/unit reports within 5 minutes of the
   posting (T-2). In the event that the Command Center does not acknowledge within 5
   minutes, the wing/unit will contact the Command Center via telephonic notification to ensure
   that they are in receipt of the Jabber notification and answer any questions at that time.
   3.6.4. Units may submit exercise CCIRs to the AFGSC Command Center at any time using
   the “AFGSC.exercise” Jabber room. When mission dictates, the Command Center attempts
   to reply to exercise messages and provide feedback on reports submitted. All exercise
   reports must state “EXERCISE” at the beginning and end of the report.
3.7. Asynchronous Reports. Asynchronous communication does not require that all parties
involved in the communication need to be present and available at the same time. Examples of
this include e-mail (the receiver does not have to be logged on when the sender sends the e-mail
message) and discussion boards, which allow conversations to evolve and community to develop
over a period of time. Units will submit an asynchronous report using SKIWeb for all Initial,
Follow Up, Final, Correction, and Initial/Final AFGSC CCIR reports.
   3.7.1. Reports will contain the who, what, when, where, why, how, operational impact,
   media applicability, and other pertinent information of the event/incident being reported,
   based on available information. Units will include any updated information gathered after
   the initial Jabber notification, without exceeding the time criteria (T-2). Do not delay
   asynchronous reporting to obtain additional information (T-2).
 12                                                         AFGSCI10-500 8 JANUARY 2014


       3.7.1.1. AFGSC units will post in Jabber, that an asynchronous report has been posted in
       SKIWeb (Initial, Follow Up, Final, Correction, and Initial/Final). The AFGSC
       Command Center will acknowledge the Jabber entry within 5 minutes and review for
       accuracy.
       3.7.1.2. Information requested by the AFGSC Command Center during synchronous
       reporting will be provided in an asynchronous report when the information becomes
       available. Reports are not authorized to be closed prior to answering questions from the
       asking HHQ element.
   3.7.2. All efforts should be made to ensure AFGSC Command Center has acknowledged
   Jabber notifications prior to posting into SKIWeb and that all questions have been answered.
   3.7.3. Units will address AFGSC, GOC and applicable TF on all reports to include AF
   OPREP-3 reports in SKIWeb.
   3.7.4. AFGSC Command Center will assess unit reports for possible higher category
   reporting requirements.
   3.7.5. Ensure reports containing classified or special intelligence information are marked
   IAW Para 3.5.2.7 of this document.
   3.7.6. If not answered in the initial record report, follow up reporting will continue until all
   of the following questions are answered: who, what, when, where, why, and how as the
   information becomes available.
   3.7.7. If seven calendar days have elapsed from the Initial report and these questions are not
   answered, a final AFGSC CCIR report will be submitted stating that “No further information
   will be provided through AFGSC CCIR channels”. Identify POC(s), agency(ies), and
   contact number(s) if applicable. (T-2).
   3.7.8. MINIMIZE.       Submission of AFGSC CCIR reports will not be affected by
   MINIMIZE.
3.8. Synchronous/Asynchronous Outages.
   3.8.1. For Jabber outage, units will notify the AFGSC Command Center via telephonic
   notification for synchronous reporting.
       3.8.1.1. The telephonic notification will be brief with just enough information to inform
       all conferees of the situation. This brief narrative will not be the narrative uploaded into
       SKIWeb.
   3.8.2. For SKIWeb outage, units will submit asynchronous reports via SIPRNet Microsoft
   Outlook.
3.9. HHQ Interest. Units that receive follow up information in regards to a CCIR report that
meets BEELINE/PINNACLE criteria will close the CCIR report by putting the word “CLOSED”
at the end of the subject line, and report all information (including previously reported
information from the CCIR report and new information) as an Initial AF OPREP-3
BEELINE/PINNACLE. Units will not add new information into a CCIR report prior to closing.
   3.9.1. Units will not be required to post follow up information meeting
   BEELINE/PINNACLE criteria into the AFGSC Command Center Jabber room or SKIWeb
AFGSCI10-500 8 JANUARY 2014                                                                13


  as part of the CCIR report prior to closing. Reporting the new information takes precedence,
  and will be reported in the AF Watch Jabber room and SKIWeb IAW AFI 10-206,
  Operational Reporting. *NOTE – units will not use the verbiage “upgraded report” when
  reporting the Initial BEELINE/PINNACLE report.
 14                                                       AFGSCI10-500 8 JANUARY 2014


                                         Chapter 4

                        COCOM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

4.1. COCOM Reporting. Units will submit CCIR reports IAW EAP-STRAT Vol 12, OPORD
GLOBAL CITADEL, applicable TF Job Aids and this instruction. If there is conflict between
this document and EAP-STRAT Vol 12, OPORD Global Citadel or TF Job Aid, then the
USSTRATCOM documents take precedence.
   4.1.1. Synchronous Reporting. Units will submit an initial notification (synchronous
   reports) via Jabber Chat as described in Para. 3.6 The Battle Watch Commander (BWC) will
   acknowledge receipt within the USSTRATCOM GOC Jabber room (STRATCOM_goc_nc3)
   (T-0). If the BWC does not acknowledge receipt in Jabber within 5 minutes, the reporting
   unit will request telephonic acknowledgement through the AFGSC Command Center to the
   BWC. To ensure that 8 AF and 20 AF are informed of any incident or event that becomes
   reportable, Barksdale CP, acting as the 8 AF CP, and F.E. Warren CP, acting as 20 AF CP,
   will ensure that procedures are in place to notify their respective NAF leadership (T-3).
   4.1.2. Asynchronous Reporting. Units will submit asynchronous reports via SKIWeb as
   described in Para. 3.7 BWC will acknowledge receipt within SKIWeb as a blog entry. If the
   BWC does not acknowledge receipt in SKIWeb within 5 minutes, the reporting unit will
   request telephonic acknowledgement through the AFGSC Command Center to the
   USSTRATCOM BWC. Ensure USSTRATCOM, GOC (no sub categories) and applicable
   TF is added as an affected area on all reports (T-0). Follow Up reports will be submitted as
   described in Attachment 6. To ensure that 8 AF and 20 AF are informed of any incident or
   event that becomes reportable, Barksdale CP, acting as the 8 AF CP, and F.E. Warren CP,
   acting as 20 AF CP, will ensure that procedures are in place to notify their respective NAF
   leadership (T-3).
   4.1.3. Non-Operational Reports. Non-Operational reports are reports submitted through
   other agency channels (e.g., Safety, Security Forces, etc.). Examples of non-operational
   reports include, but are not limited to: DULL SWORD, Possible Code Compromise (PCC),
   Security reports, Cyber GENADMIN, etc.
      4.1.3.1. When there is an existing reporting requirement for non-operational reports,
      units will make the notifications that those reports have been submitted via Jabber input.
      The notification will include DTG, report number (if applicable), title of event and a
      sanitized summary of details.         Units will advise submitting agencies to add
      USSTRATCOM GOC to the report recipient listing (T-0). No SKIWeb entry is required
      by CP on non-operational reports unless requested by an agency. If requested, the
      SKIWeb entry will consist of the same information from the initial Jabber notification.
   4.1.4. AF OPREP-3/AFGSC CCIR Reports That Require Non-Operational Reporting. If an
   event/incident occurs that meets AF OPREP-3/AFGSC CCIR reporting criteria, but still
   requires another type of report through different agency channels (e.g., Safety report, DULL
   SWORD, PCC, etc.), units will identify in the AF OPREP-3/AFGSC CCIR report that the
   event meets non-operational reporting requirements. They will reference the type of non-
   operational report and service tracking number, if applicable. When reporting via AF
   OPREP-3/AFGSC CCIR channels, units will use the following statement:
AFGSCI10-500 8 JANUARY 2014                                                                  15


     4.1.4.1. “This event has been identified to include [type of non-operational]. Additional
     reporting will be made through appropriate channels. Tracking number - XXXX” (T-0).
     4.1.4.2. Once a non-operational report is submitted through service channels, units will
     notify the AFGSC Command Center via Jabber Chat (T-0). The AFGSC Command
     Center will notify the BWC that the report has been submitted. Notification will include
     the service report number (if applicable), title of event, and a brief sanitized summary of
     the report to include an operational impact assessment (obtained through the appropriate
     authority) (T-0). BWC will determine dissemination requirements within the COCOM.
  4.1.5. Nuclear Current Operations Duty Officer (NCODO) Notification. Information that
  does not meet AF OPREP-3, AFGSC CCIR, or EAP-STRAT Vol 12 reporting criteria, but
  requires STRATCOM/J38 notification.
     4.1.5.1. J38 NCODO Telephone. DSN 271-1737 or 271-6631 (duty hours 1100Z –
     2300Z); SIPR email: nuclearcurrentopsdo@stratcom.smil.mil (follow-up to the
     telephone notification). Courtesy copy NAFs, applicable TFs and AFGSC Command
     Center for all SIPR email notifications (T-0).
  4.1.6. Units that are unable to meet OPLAN 8010 mission requirements (e.g., inability to
  meet alert/generation requirements) will update Force Status Reporting (FSR) and submit all
  required reports (T-0). Units will ensure procedures are in place to notify applicable TF
  when unable to meet 8010 mission requirements (T-0).
 16                                                         AFGSCI10-500 8 JANUARY 2014

                        CATEGORIES OF SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY

Table A4.1. Categories of Suspicious Activity.
This enclosure describes the potential categories to consider when evaluating suspicious activity.

a. Acquisition of Expertise. Unjustified attempts to obtain or conduct specialized training in
security concepts, military weapons or tactics, or other unusual capabilities such as specialized
transport or handling capabilities that would cause a reasonable person to perceive a threat to
AFGSC personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.

b. Breach or Attempted Intrusion. Unauthorized entry or attempted entry into a restricted area
or protected site; impersonation of authorized personnel (e.g., police, security, or janitorial
personnel).

c. Eliciting Information. Suspicious questioning of personnel by any means about particular
AFGSC structures, functions, personnel, or procedures at the facility or infrastructure.

d. Expressed or Implied Threat. A threat to AFGSC personnel or threatened damage to or
compromise of a DoD facility or infrastructure.

e. Flyover or Landing. Suspicious overflight of or landing near an AFGSC facility or
infrastructure by any type of flying vehicle (e.g., airplane, helicopter, unmanned aerial vehicle,
hang glider).

f. Materials Acquisition or Storage. Acquisition of unusual quantities of precursor material
(e.g., cell phones, pagers, fuel, and timers); unauthorized or unlicensed individual or group
attempts to obtain precursor chemicals, agents, or toxic materials; or rental of storage units for
the purpose of storing precursor material, chemicals, or apparatuses for mixing chemicals.

g. Misrepresentation. Misusing or presenting false insignia, documents, or identification or
engaging in any other activity to misrepresent one’s affiliation.

h. Recruiting. Building operations teams and developing contacts, or collecting personnel data,
banking data, or travel data under circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to
perceive a threat to AFGSC personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.

i. Sabotage, Tampering, or Vandalism. Damaging, manipulating, or defacing part of an AFGSC
facility, infrastructure, or protected site. Acts of vandalism committed by DoD civilian
employees, Service members, or their dependents should not be reported as suspicious activity
unless those acts relate to a pattern of criminal activity or otherwise would cause a reasonable
person to perceive a threat to DoD personnel, facilities, or forces in transit.

j. Surveillance. Monitoring the activity of DoD personnel, facilities, processes, or systems,
including showing unusual interest in a facility, infrastructure, or personnel (e.g., observation
 26                                                            AFGSCI10-500 8 JANUARY 2014


through binoculars, taking notes, drawing maps or diagrams of the facility, and taking pictures or
video of a facility, infrastructure, personnel, or the surrounding environment) under
circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to perceive a threat to DoD personnel,
facilities, or forces in transit.

k. Testing of Security. A challenge to, or a series of interactions with AFGSC installations,
vessels, personnel, or systems that could reveal physical, personnel, or capabilities
vulnerabilities.

l. Theft, Loss, or Diversion. Theft or loss associated with an AFGSC facility or infrastructure
(e.g., of badges, uniforms, identification cards, emergency vehicles, technology, or documents,
whether classified or unclassified) that are proprietary to the facility, or a diversion of attention
from an AFGSC facility or infrastructure that is related to a theft or loss associated with that
facility.

m. Weapons Discovery. The discovery of personal weapons legally owned by DoD civilian
employees, Service members, or their dependents should not be reported as suspicious activity if
the discovery is solely the result of the owner’s failure to properly store or secure the weapons.

n. Unexplained Absences of International Military Students. International military students who
are unexpectedly absent from scheduled activities when the absence is without proper
authorization and lasts more than 24 hours, and an appropriate official with the host DoD
organization determines that the absence is not due to a misunderstanding in scheduling, to
sickness, or to another similar reason.
