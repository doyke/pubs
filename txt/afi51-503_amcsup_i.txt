                                            Chapter 1

                  ACCIDENT AND SAFETY INVESTIGATION BOARDS

1.1. General Considerations. Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 6055.07, Accident
Investigation, Reporting, and Record Keeping, requires each Department of Defense (DoD)
component to conduct safety investigations and legal investigations for accidental deaths, certain
injuries, occupational illness, and property damage. The Services use different terminology to
refer to legal investigations. The Air Force uses the term ―accident‖ investigation, the Army
uses the term ―collateral‖ investigation, and the Navy uses the term ―JAGMAN‖ investigation.
Air Force accident investigations are separate from and independent of safety investigations.
Accident investigations are conducted by accident investigation boards (AIB) while safety
investigations are conducted by safety investigation boards (SIB). AIBs consist of a board
president, legal advisor, and other board members as required. The AIB president is solely
responsible for the contents of the AIB report.
1.2. Purpose of Accident Investigations.
     1.2.1. An AIB conducts a legal investigation to inquire into the facts surrounding Air Force
     aircraft and aerospace accidents, to prepare a publicly-releasable report, to gather and
     preserve evidence for use in litigation, claims, disciplinary actions, administrative
     proceedings, and for other purposes.
     1.2.2. AIB reports are:
        1.2.2.1. Provided and personally briefed to the next-of-kin (NoK) of military and
        civilians killed and to individuals seriously injured in the accident.
        1.2.2.2. Written to be publicly-releasable reports and released to members of the public,
        media, Congress, and government agencies upon request.
        1.2.2.3. Used to adjudicate claims or contracts in favor of or against the United States
        that result from the accident.
        1.2.2.4. Used by Air Force commanders to determine whether punitive or adverse
        administrative action should be taken against persons whose negligence or misconduct
        contributed to the accident.
1.3. Scope of Accident Investigations. The AIB investigates and reports the cause or causes of
the mishap and/or those factors that substantially contributed to the mishap. An AIB is staffed
with the appropriate number of personnel, with the required skills, in order to complete the
investigation within 30 days of receipt of the completed Part I of the SIB report. An AIB
investigates unit deficiencies and other matters only to the extent they are causal or substantially
contributed to the mishap. Matters having no direct bearing on the mishap and not otherwise
required to be documented in the AIB report by this Instruction should be referred in writing,
separate from the AIB report, to the convening authority’s Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). See
paragraph (para) 4.3.10 of this Instruction.
1.4. Purpose of Safety Investigations.
     1.4.1. Safety investigations are conducted under Air Force Instruction (AFI) 91-204, Safety
     Investigations and Reports. Safety investigations and reports are conducted and written
  AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                       9


         solely to prevent future mishaps. Safety investigations take priority over any corresponding
         legal investigations.
         1.4.2. During certain types of safety investigations, a promise of confidentiality may be
         granted to witnesses and contractors in order to promote full and timely disclosure of
         information. SIB statements and documents obtained under a promise of confidentiality, as
         well as SIB deliberations, findings, and recommendations, are privileged, and they are not
         disclosed outside of the Air Force safety community. The Air Force cannot use privileged
         safety information for line-of-duty determinations, claims adjudication, flying evaluation
         board proceedings, pecuniary liability determinations, or in any civil, criminal, or adverse
         administrative actions. Access to privileged safety information is limited to those with a
         need to know for mishap prevention. See DoDI 6055.07, Enclosure E4.5.3.3, for the rare
         exceptions to this policy. At any time before or during the AIB, AIB members are not
         authorized access to privileged safety information for the mishap they are investigating. The
         SIB shall not provide privileged safety information to the AIB either in Part I or in the
         additional evidence.
         1.4.3. The SIB produces a two-part report for Class A mishaps, which are generally defined
         as mishaps resulting in a total direct cost of $2,000,000 or more, a fatality or permanent total
         disability, or destruction of an Air Force aircraft or aerospace asset. Part I contains non-
         privileged, factual information. Part II contains confidential witness and contractor
         statements and documents, as well as the SIB deliberations, findings, and recommendations.
         Part II of the SIB report is privileged and only used for safety purposes. See Attachment 1 of
         this Instruction for the definition of ―direct cost.‖
            1.4.3.1. A two-part report may be produced following a Class B mishap. It is rarely
            produced following a Class C mishap.
         1.4.4. The SIB Part I is assembled prior to the start of the AIB. The completed SIB Part I
         hand-off to the AIB marks the AIB start date. The SIB Part I is incorporated as supporting
         evidence in Tabs A through S of the AIB report. In limited circumstances, Claims and Tort
         Litigation Division, Air Force Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA/JACC) may authorize the
         start of an AIB prior to completion of the SIB. See Table 1.1 of this Instruction.

  Table 1.1. Distinctions between Safety Investigations and Accident Investigations.

  1.5. When AIB Investigations are Required. Except as provided in para 1.8 of this
  Instruction, an AIB must be convened for on-duty, Class A accidents involving Air Force
  aircraft, unmanned aerial system (UASs) (including unmanned aerial vehicles and aerostat
  balloons), missiles, or space accidents. A Class A accident is one resulting in at least one of the
  following:
     1.5.1. A fatality or permanent total disability, as defined by DoDI 6055.07, E7.1.2.
     1.5.2. The destruction of an Air Force aircraft, UAS, missile, space launch system, or space
     asset. An asset is considered destroyed if it is not economically repairable. An asset that is
     damaged but will not be repaired is not necessarily considered destroyed. See Attachment 1
     of this Instruction for definition of ―destroyed aircraft, UAS, missile, space launch system, or
     space asset.‖
           1.5.2.1. AIBs are not mandatory for destroyed remotely piloted subscale aircraft and
           aerial targets.
     1.5.3. A total mishap cost of $2,000,000 or more to government and other property. An AIB
     is not required for mishaps causing damage solely to government property and not involving
     destruction of an aircraft; however, some type of legal investigation may still be required as
     described in para 1.6 and para 1.7 of this Instruction.
           1.5.3.1. See DoDI 6055.07, Enclosure 2 and AFI 91-204, Chapter (Ch) 1 and Attachment
           1 for more information about mishap categories and classes. Calculate total mishap cost
           in accordance with guidance specified in DoDI 6055.07, E4.12; AFI 91-204, Ch 1; and
           Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports.
           1.5.3.2. Accidents causing damage solely to government property that exceeds
           $2,000,000 must be reviewed by the convening authority for a determination whether to
           convene an AIB or other type of investigation as appropriate. The convening authority’s
           SJA should document the determination.
  1.6. Discretionary AIBs. In instances where DoDI 6055.07 requires a legal investigation for an
  aerospace accident but the circumstances of the accident do not specifically require an AIB as
  per para 1.5 of this Instruction, an AIB is discretionary. Conduct either an AIB or another type
  of legal investigation (as described in para 1.7 of this Instruction) for the following mishap
  categories requiring a legal investigation pursuant to DoDI 6055.07, E4.6.3:
     1.6.1. Mishaps likely to generate a large amount of public, media, or Congressional interest.
     AIB reports are designed for public access; other investigation reports are releasable only
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                  11


   upon request and in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552. See
   definition in para 7.5.1 of this Instruction for high-interest mishaps.
   1.6.2. Mishaps from which litigation for or against the Government or a Government
   contractor is anticipated.
   1.6.3. Mishaps from which disciplinary or adverse administrative action against an
   individual is anticipated.
1.6. (AMC) Discretionary AIBs. HQ AMC/SE must protect unauthorized disclosure of safety
privileged information. All AMC Staff Judge Advocates should be proactive in advising
HQ AMC/JAA whether there is a need or desire at the wing or base level to conduct an AIB for a
particular mishap. Additionally, HQ AMC/A3, HQ AMC/A4, and any other Directorate with an
interest in a particular mishap, should appoint a point of contact (POC) liaison who can provide
advice and expertise to HQ AMC/JAA in order to determine whether an AIB for a Class A
mishap should be convened or waived, based on non-safety privileged information obtained
through the functional chain of command.
1.7. Other DoDI 6055. 07 Legal Investigations. In addition to AIBs, there are several types of
legal investigations which satisfy the DoDI 6055.07 legal investigation/report requirement:
Security Forces or Air Force Office of Special Operations (AFOSI) investigations, Commander
Directed Investigations, Report of Survey investigations, and Line of Duty determinations.
These investigations inquire into all the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident and
preserve all available evidence for use in litigation, claims, disciplinary action, or adverse
administrative action.
1.8. Accidents Not Requiring AIBs. There is no requirement to investigate the following
accidents under this Instruction:
   1.8.1. Death, injury, or property damage by direct action of an enemy or hostile force.
   1.8.2. Intentional or expected damage to Air Force equipment or property (e.g., authorized
   testing or combat training, including missile and ordnance firing; destruction of weapon
   system to prevent capture by enemy or hostile force; etc.).
   1.8.3. Accidents investigated by another federal agency or military department resulting in a
   publicly-releasable report.
   1.8.4. All suspected cases of friendly fire. DoDI 6055.07, E2.1.16, E4.6.3.5, and E4.7,
   requires a legal investigation report for all suspected cases of friendly fire. Such
   investigations are not AIBs. The commander of the applicable Unified Combatant Command
   convenes friendly fire investigations, and the combatant commander chooses the Service’s
   regulation that applies. This Instruction does not apply to friendly fire investigations but the
   Air Force component of a Unified Combatant Command may use it as a guide when the
   combatant commander has assigned to it the responsibility for conducting a friendly fire
   investigation.
1.9. Investigation Boards and Reports
   1.9.1. Part I of the SIB report must be completed prior to the start of the AIB; in rare cases,
   AFLOA/JACC may grant exceptions. Ongoing safety investigations generally take
   precedence over accident investigations, and in the event of conflicts between the two
   investigations regarding access to the accident site, acquiring and examining evidence, and
12                                                    AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012


  interviewing witnesses, safety investigations have priority. For this reason, and to facilitate
  the AIB process, the two investigations should not overlap in time.
  1.9.2. In the case of a high-interest mishap, the convening authority may convene an AIB
  prior to a SIB.
     1.9.2.1. If there is no preceding SIB, a trained investigating officer (IO) not currently
     assigned to a full-time safety position may serve as an AIB functional area expert (FAE)
     to assist in gathering factual non-privileged evidence. See para 3.5 of this Instruction.
     1.9.2.2. In accordance with DoDI 6055.07 Enclosure E4.6.2, personnel currently
     assigned to full-time safety position will not be appointed a member or FAE of the AIB.
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                              13


                                          Chapter 2

               CONVENING AN ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION BOARD

2.1. Convening Authority.
   2.1.1. The Major Command (MAJCOM) commander who convened or would have
   convened the preceding safety investigation under AFI 91-204, also convenes the accident
   investigation. See Attachment 1 of this Instruction for definition of ―MAJCOM
   commander.‖
      2.1.1.1. The MAJCOM vice-commander may convene the accident investigation unless
      the MAJCOM commander withholds this authorization.
   2.1.2. The convening authority initiates an AIB by appointing the AIB president in a
   convening order. The order may also list additional AIB members.
      2.1.2.1. The convening authority’s SJA may sign the convening order ―FOR THE
      COMMANDER‖ after the convening authority selects a board president unless the
      MAJCOM commander withholds this authorization.
      2.1.2.2. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/SE will provide HQ AMC/JA an updated list of
      AFSC-trained board presidents upon request. If an AIB is determined appropriate for a
      particular mishap,      HQ AMC/JA will contact the appropriate AMC Directorates to
      nominate members to the AIB. HQ AMC/A3 will normally nominate a qualified AIB
      President, with the concurrence of                 18 AF/CC or EC/CC, unless special
      requirements dictate otherwise, such as a maintenance accident requiring a maintenance
      officer as AIB President (in which case HQ AMC/A4 would likely nominate the AIB
      President). In all cases, especially those with more than one functional involvement, HQ
      AMC/JA will determine which Directorate(s) should provide members to the AIB.
      2.1.2.3. (Added-AMC) Upon request, AMC Directorates will provide HQ AMC/JA
      with nominees for AIB members having relevant technical expertise. AFI 51-503 does
      not require special training for these members; however, the nominees should be of a
      commensurate rank and experience to effectively address the potential issues within their
      areas of expertise. The Directorate may obtain nominees from any AMC unit other than
      the mishap wing, unless such prohibition is waived through HQ AMC/JA. Thus,
      normally, HQ AMC/A4 will nominate maintenance members, HQ AMC/SG will
      nominate medical members, and HQ AMC/A3 will nominate pilot members or other
      technical members, as needed. HQ AMC/JA will nominate a legal advisor and a
      recorder.
   2.1.3. After the convening order appointing the AIB president is issued, the convening
   authority’s SJA may appoint or substitute additional AIB members or FAEs unless the
   MAJCOM commander withholds this authorization.
   2.1.4. See a sample convening order at Attachment 2, Figure A2.1 of this Instruction.

   2.2.1. The gaining MAJCOM convenes AIBs for accidents involving Air Force Reserve
   Command (AFRC) and ANG aerospace vehicles. AFRC and ANG have inherent authority
   to conduct accident investigations, using this Instruction as a framework, for any accidents
   not investigated by the active duty Air Force.
       2.2.1.1. If the accident investigation will be conducted pursuant to Ch 11 of this
       Instruction and AFRC aerospace assets are involved, AFRC may convene the AIB unless
       the gaining MAJCOM withholds this authorization.
   2.2.2. When investigating an ANG aircraft accident, the convening authority should appoint
   an ANG member to the AIB, with the concurrence of the respective State Adjutant General.
   Contact the ANG/SJA for assistance.
   2.2.3. Members of the AFRC and ANG may serve in any capacity on any AIB, to include
   AIB president.
   2.2.4. Rank and training requirements found in Ch 3 of this Instruction apply.
2.3. Accidents Involving Air Force Members Assigned to Another Military Branch. Follow
the inter-service participation guidance in DoDI 6055.07, E4.13 for aerospace accidents that
involve an Air Force member assigned to another military branch to avoid duplicative
investigations and reports.
2.4. Accidents Involving Assets or Personnel from Other MAJCOMS/Military
Branches. When an accident involves assets or personnel from more than one MAJCOM or
involves assets or personnel from other branches of the Armed Forces, refer to DoDI 6055.07,
E4.13. The AIB convening authority shall be the same individual who has authority to convene
the preceding SIB. See Ch 3 of this Instruction for additional AIB member qualifications.
2.5. Accidents Involving Civil Aircraft. An aerospace accident in the United States involving
both civil aircraft and United States Air Force aircraft and aerospace vehicles shall require the
convening authority’s SJA contact AFLOA/JACC to determine the potential for and scope of
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) participation or investigation.
   2.5.1. Should the NTSB exercise their prerogative to organize the lead investigation, refer to
   AFI 91-206(I), Participation in a Military or Civil Aircraft Accident Safety Investigation.
   Additionally, the convening authority’s SJA should consult with AFLOA/JACC prior to
   advising the convening authority whether to conduct a separate AIB.
2.6. Accidents Involving United States Air Force Aircraft in Foreign Countries or Foreign
Military Aircraft Accidents in the United States. United States Air Force aerospace accidents
in foreign territory (except UAS) or accidents in the United States involving foreign military
aircraft shall be subject to a legal investigation regardless of the mishap location or the degree of
foreign country involvement.
   2.6.1. Treaties, statutes, agreements, and/or other applicable authorities may affect the
   investigation of accidents that occur outside the United States involving Air Force aerospace
   assets. Similar authorities may affect the investigation of Air Force accidents involving
   personnel or property of foreign military forces. When an accident involving Air Force
   aerospace asset occurs in a foreign territory or involves foreign military personnel or
   property, comply with this Instruction to the extent allowed by applicable treaties,
   agreements, and other applicable authorities. The requirement to conduct an AIB and
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                    15


   produce an AIB report in accordance with this Instruction remains unaffected by the location
   of the mishap or the degree of participation of a foreign country in the accident investigation.
   2.6.2. The convening authority’s SJA or the SJA of the component responsible for air
   operations where the mishap occurred shall refer to the treaty, statute, regulation, or
   agreement under which the aircraft was operating to determine if the document addresses
   accident investigation protocol and identifies provisions requiring a joint or multi-nation
   investigation or an appointment of a foreign observer to the AIB. Consult AFLOA/JACC for
   guidance regarding the scope and nature of Air Force involvement in a discretionary AIB.
2.7. Accidents Involving Space Assets. Aerospace accidents involving both civil and United
States Air Force space assets yield unique issues regarding commercial vendors and other federal
agencies conducting independent investigations. Potential issues to consider include: who is the
lead investigating office or agency; what are the procedures/protocols for information sharing
and the handling of classified/sensitive payloads; what are the existing memorandums of
agreement (MOA)/memorandums of understanding (MOU) with other federal agencies; whether
the space asset is operational or experimental; and if the asset has been handed over to the Air
Force or is still in check-out by the contractor or acquisition agency (Space and Missile Systems
Center or SMC). Engage in early and continuous consultation with Air Force Space Command’s
SJA (AFSPC/JA).
2.8. AIB Funding/Orders.

   AMC/JA.            HQ AMC/FM will ensure an ESP code is provided to HQ AMC/JA for
   reimbursement to the local funds. If a unit has a conflict with the provided ESP code, HQ
   AMC/JA will fund AIB member’s travel with a fund cite authorization letter.
       2.8.1.1. Each AIB member’s unit shall issue his/her orders. Orders should authorize 60
       days of travel, variations in travel, dual billeting, excess baggage, rental car, and full per

                  CONDUCTING THE ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION

5.1. AIB Resource Guidance. Prior to arriving at the host installation, all AIB members should
review this Instruction, any applicable MAJCOM supplement, and the following publications, as
necessary:
   5.1.1. AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints Resolution, provides detailed guidance for
   other types of administrative investigations. Ch 2 and Attachments 8 through 10 contain
   useful information about witness interviews, rights advisements, and handling evidence.
   5.1.2. AFI 34-1101, Assistance to Survivors of Persons Killed in Air Force Aviation Mishaps
   and Other Incidents, provides guidance on rendering assistance to family members of those
   killed in aviation accidents.
   5.1.3. AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, governs the safety investigation and
   describes the contents of Part I of the SIB report, which shall form Tabs A through S of the
   AIB report.
   5.1.4. AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, implements the Privacy Act within the Air Force.
   Prior to publishing the AIB report, personal information must be redacted to protect privacy
   interests.
   5.1.5. AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. This implements Air Force
   Policy Directive (AFPD) 31-4, Information Security, and supplements DoD 5200.1-R,
   Information Security Program, which describes how to protect classified information.
   5.1.6. DoD Regulation 5400.7/AF Supplement describes how to process FOIA requests.
   5.1.7. Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 91-211, USAF Guide to Aviation Safety Investigation,
   describes the safety investigation process.
5.2. AIB Initial Actions.
   5.2.1. The AIB president should contact the AIB legal advisor for an initial briefing. If the
   AIB legal advisor has not been identified, then the AIB president should contact the
   convening authority's SJA.
   5.2.2. For accidents involving foreign interests, the AIB legal advisor shall consult the
   convening authority’s SJA and host installation’s SJA regarding immediate responsibilities to
   foreign military and civilian authorities. The AIB legal advisor shall, in turn, brief the AIB
   president.
   5.2.3. Following accidents involving a fatality and/or serious injury, the AIB president and
   legal advisor shall proceed to the accident site (or to the location where the SIB convenes)
   within 48 hours of the SIB’s arrival in order to contact the FLO, to meet NoK and/or
   seriously injured personnel, address media concerns, and view the mishap site.
       5.2.3.1. Waiver of the 48 hour visit by the convening authority does not relieve an AIB
       president of his/her responsibilities, once appointed, to coordinate all NoK, seriously
       injured personnel, public, and media requests for investigation information, to include
       status update immediately after the mishap.
32                                                    AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012


     5.2.3.2. The AIB president is responsible for providing information to the NoK and
     seriously injured personnel regarding the status of the SIB and AIB investigations. See
     para 7.2 through para 7.5 of this Instruction.
     5.2.3.3. Lack of an on-scene AIB president does not warrant the SIB president assuming
     the AIB president’s responsibilities.
     5.2.3.4. The AIB president coordinates with the incident commander (if applicable), the
     AIB legal advisor, the convening authority's SJA, and the FLO regarding NoK requests to
     visit the mishap site.
  5.2.4. To avoid the inadvertent receipt of safety-privileged information, the AIB president
  should not contact the SIB president without consulting with the AIB legal advisor or
  obtaining an initial briefing from the convening authority’s SJA. Thereafter, the AIB
  president, or the legal advisor on the AIB president’s behalf, may engage with the SIB
  president to:
     5.2.4.1. Determine the status of SAR, recovery of remains, and salvage operations.
     5.2.4.2. Coordinate a visit to the mishap site prior to removal of the wreckage, if the AIB
     president so requests.
     5.2.4.3. Determine the status of the safety investigation and decide when and where to
     proceed with the AIB.
         5.2.4.3.1. The SIB president may not discuss privileged safety information, but
         he/she may relay the facts of the accident and describe the technical reports that will
         be in the SIB Part I to the AIB president.
         5.2.4.3.2. In any substantive discussions (e.g., phone calls, e-mails) between the SIB
         and AIB presidents, the AIB legal advisor should be present when possible. The AIB
         legal advisor ensures that safety-privileged information is not inadvertently relayed to
         the AIB president.
  5.2.5. The AIB president coordinates with the AIB legal advisor and contacts the host
  installation commander or the host installation liaison officer to obtain work areas,
  equipment, and administrative support. See Attachment 3, Figure A3.1 of this Instruction for
  a listing of AIB support requirements.
  5.2.6. The SIB president shall transfer custody of the wreckage to the AIB president in
  writing.
  5.2.7. The AIB legal advisor should coordinate and be present for a face-to-face transfer of
  the SIB Part I from the SIB to the AIB. The AIB president may also be present for the face-
  to-face transfer of the SIB Part I from the SIB to the AIB. The SIB must transfer all non-
  privileged documents, including all original documents, gathered by the SIB but not included
  in the SIB Part I to the AIB.
     5.2.7.1. If safety privilege markings appear on any document or if the AIB legal advisor
     suspects any document to contain privileged information, the AIB legal advisor shall
     consult with the convening authority’s SJA and AFSC/JA before releasing the
     information to the rest of the AIB.
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                33


       5.2.7.2. If the SIB provides an electronic copy of the SIB Part I, the AIB legal advisor
       should ensure the AIB also obtains the original documents constituting the SIB Part I.
   5.2.8. The AIB legal advisor should brief members of the board on the purpose and format
   of the AIB report and explain the AIB process. See para 5.3 of this Instruction for a
   suggested AIB schedule.
   5.2.9. The AIB president shall assign each AIB member sections of the report to draft in
   accordance with AIB member duties outlined in para 4.4 through para 4.11 of this
   Instruction.
   5.2.10. After the AIB legal advisor screens the SIB Part I and other SIB materials to remove
   all privileged safety material contained therein, the AIB legal advisor shall provide all
   materials to the AIB members to review, and the AIB:
       5.2.10.1. Determines which additional tests, if any, should be conducted (e.g.,
       metallurgy, hydraulics, simulator, forensics, control surfaces, etc.).
       5.2.10.2. Formulates witness interview questions designed to elicit additional
       information to aid in finding the cause and/or substantially contributing factors and
       drafting the AIB report.
   5.2.11. The SIB shall provide a list of all released witnesses (including witnesses promised
   confidentiality and regardless of whether the SIB reduced their statement to writing). The
   list should include telephone numbers and description of each witness’s role in the accident
   (e.g., crewmember, maintainer, observer, or NoK/family member) to aid in identifying
   witnesses the AIB desires to interview.
   5.2.12. The AIB president consults with the AIB legal advisor and convening authority’s
   SJA regarding requests for wreckage repair, release of salvageable wreckage parts, and
   release of mishap aircraft servicing equipment prior to completion of the accident
   investigation. See para 9.6 and para 9.7 of this Instruction.
5.3. Suggested AIB Schedule. Plan to complete the accident investigation and report within 30
days from receipt of the completed Part I of the SIB report.

AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                 35


5.4. Gathering and Reviewing Additional Evidence. During the course of the investigation,
AIB members shall review all non-privileged mishap-related evidence. Consider the following
when handling evidence and preparing it for inclusion in the AIB report:
   5.4.1. CVR and HUD Tapes. AIB shall review CVR and HUD tapes relevant to the
   accident. The video and audio tapes shall NOT be released to the public unless required to
   be released under DoD Regulation 5400.7/AF Supplement and in accordance with applicable
   third party privacy concerns. However, CVR and HUD transcripts are publicly releasable
   and may be included in the AIB report. Transcribe the CVR and/or HUD tapes as soon as
   practicable.
      5.4.1.1. Requests from family members to listen to CVR and/or see HUD tapes shall be
      forwarded through the convening authority’s SJA to AFLOA/JACC, for consideration
      under DoD Regulation 5400.7/AF Supplement, in coordination with the Air Force
      Administrative Law Division (AF/JAA).
      5.4.1.2. Classified information, information protected from public release, inappropriate
      comments, and non-relevant conversations shall be redacted from CVR and/or HUD
      transcripts as necessary to protect national security or privacy interests. Consult with the
      convening authority’s SJA for guidance.
      5.4.1.3. Upon completion of the investigation, the AIB legal advisor or recorder shall
      forward the original CVR and HUD tapes to the convening authority’s SJA for storage
      with the additional evidentiary materials until AFLOA/JACC releases the wreckage from
      legal hold.
   5.4.2. Sensitive AFIs, TOs, Maintenance Manuals, and Flight Manuals. The AIB may
   gather and review documents that are restricted from public release, such as documents
   protected by the Privacy Act, the Arms Export Control Act, and the Export Administration
   Act of 1979. The AIB will frequently need to reference excerpts of restricted access
   documents in the AIB Tabs to support factual information in the AIB report. The AIB must
   obtain written permission from the proper release authority before including restricted
   information in the AIB report.
      5.4.2.1. Contact the OPR listed on the cover of the instruction, order, or manual. See
      AFI 61-204, Disseminating Scientific and Technical Information, for further guidance.
      5.4.2.2. Include only the cover page and the minimum excerpted information necessary
      to support the Summary of Facts and Statement of Opinion.
      5.4.2.3. Submit a written request, email or otherwise, to the named OPR articulating that
      the AIB produces a publicly-releasable report and is requesting release authority for
      specific pages or excerpts from the document.
      5.4.2.4. If the OPR grants release authority, include the OPR’s written response along
      with the releasable TO excerpt in the Tab section of the AIB report. Additionally,
      include a copy of the release authority’s response (with contact information intact) in
      post-investigation memorandum. Alternatively, if the OPR denies release authority
      consult the convening authority’s SJA.
36                                                    AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012


  5.4.3. Classified Information. AIB members who have the appropriate security clearances
  may review classified evidence, as needed, during the investigation. However, the AIB
  report should NOT contain classified information. See para 6.3 of this Instruction.
     5.4.3.1. If it is essential to include classified information to support the Statement of
     Opinion, then include classified testimony, documents, and information in a separate
     classified addendum. This allows the unclassified portion of the AIB report to be
     publicly released without redacting text.
  5.4.4. Foreign Evidence. For accidents in foreign territories or involving significant foreign
  interests, consult with the host installation’s SJA and convening authority’s SJA or AF/JAO,
  for procedures to gather evidence, gain access to evidence, or request evidence from foreign
  military or civilian authorities.
  5.4.5. Obtain and review all relevant medical evidence, including medical records, autopsy
  protocols, X-rays, and toxicology reports. Because of privacy concerns, it may not be
  appropriate to include these documents in the AIB report. There is generally no reason to
  include copies of medical records or extracts from them in the AIB report unless that
  information is directly related to the cause of the accident or a substantially contributing
  factor. Caution: A ―72 Hour History‖ prepared for the SIB medical member by a witness is
  almost always obtained through a promise of confidentiality. The AIB legal advisor must
  ensure this document is not accidentally transferred with the Part I. The AIB medical
  member may, nevertheless, request that an aircrew member prepare a new, non-privileged
  ―72 Hour History‖ to be adopted as testimony during a formal witness interview.
  5.4.6. Original Documents. Forward all original documents to the convening authority’s
  SJA with the post-investigation memorandum at the conclusion of the investigation. See
  para 9.2 of this Instruction. However, some documents, such as medical, dental, and
  personnel records, should be returned to their proper custodians after the AIB report is
  approved. Transmittal letters of original documents returned to their custodians should be
  included in the post-investigation memorandum.
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                37

                               INTERVIEWING WITNESSES

6.1. General Considerations.
   6.1.1. The AIB shall not interview a witness until the SIB president releases the witness.
   The SIB president may, at his or her sole discretion and if he or she believes it will not
   interfere with or compromise the safety investigation, grant the AIB access to non-privileged
   written witness statements, transcripts, and recordings before witnesses are released.
   6.1.2. The SIB shall provide the AIB with a list of all SIB witnesses. The AIB is not
   restricted to interviewing only those witnesses interviewed by the SIB, nor is the AIB
   required to formally interview all of the witnesses interviewed by the SIB. However, the
   AIB should contact all the SIB witnesses to screen them for potential interviews.
      6.1.2.1. If the AIB chooses to not interview a witness who was interviewed by the SIB,
      document on the post-investigation memorandum witness list why the SIB witness was
      not interviewed (redundant testimony, witness unavailable, relevant testimony obtained
      through another witness, etc).
      6.1.2.2. The AIB legal advisor shall review the AIB members’ proposed witness
      questions to eliminate opinion questions, safety questions, and to identify questions that
      warrant rights advisement.
   6.1.3. Determine the most appropriate order to interview witnesses. Consider interviewing
   key witnesses last or perhaps twice, once at the outset and once more after other witnesses
   have developed the background of the case. Avoid using the installation courtroom for
   interviews since a judicial atmosphere may intimidate witnesses.
   6.1.4. USAFR and ANG Accidents. The AIB legal advisor shall determine what type of
   duty orders the witness was on at the time of the accident for purposes of rights advisement.
   Direct the witness to bring a copy of his/her orders (and any other proof of duty status) that
   were in effect on the date of the mishap and the date of the interview.
      6.1.4.1. Attach a copy of the witness’s orders and any other proof of duty status to the
      post-investigation memorandum.
   6.1.5. Pre-Interview Meeting. The AIB legal advisor should meet with each witness prior to
   the interview to explain the differences between the SIB and the AIB, explain the purpose of
   the AIB, cover interview protocol, remind witnesses to avoid speculation or making
   corrective or disciplinary recommendations, address witness concerns, and collect witness
   contact information (e.g., name, address, Social Security Number) for the post-investigation
   memorandum at Attachment 2, Figure A2.15 of this Instruction. Do not collect personal
   information during the recorded interview.
      6.1.5.1. Explain that gathering this personal information is authorized by the Privacy Act
      of 1974 and provide each witness with the Privacy Act Statement at Attachment 2, Figure
      A2.19 of this Instruction.
      6.1.5.2. If a military witness requests an attorney, the AIB legal advisor should provide
      contact information for the host installation’s Area Defense Counsel (ADC).
 38                                                    AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012


   6.1.6. Witnesses who were interviewed by the SIB.
      6.1.6.1. Direct each witness not to reference the SIB during the AIB interview. AIB
      members should not know the questions asked and answered during a privileged
      interview.
      6.1.6.2. Instruct the witnesses to not state they provided any particular response to the
      SIB under a promise of confidentiality.
   6.1.7. Do not offer promises of confidentiality to witnesses.
   6.1.8. Administer the oath or affirmation to all witnesses on the record prior to initiating
   questioning.
   6.1.9. DoD military members and civilian employees must appear when called. A witness
   may not refuse to answer questions simply because the answer may adversely affect another
   person. A witness may only refuse to answer questions to prevent self-incrimination.
   6.1.10. Instruct witnesses to refrain from talking with their hands, since it cannot be
   transcribed. Tell the witnesses to answer "yes" or "no" rather than gesturing.
      6.1.10.1. If a witness describes distance with his/her hands, translate the distance for the
      record (e.g., "The witness is holding his hands approximately three feet apart"). As
      necessary, photograph gestures or models showing relative positions to preserve
      information for the record.
      6.1.10.2. If a witness refers to a diagram while testifying, ask him/her to mark where
      events or actions occurred. Include the diagram or a photograph of the diagram in the
      witness’s transcript.
   6.1.11. Instruct the witness to refrain from using technical jargon or acronyms during the
   interview since it may not be understood by the public.
      6.1.11.1. If acronyms and technical jargon are unavoidable, ask the witness to provide
      definitions or explanation on the record and list the acronyms in the Commonly Used
      Acronyms and Abbreviations Table. See para 8.6 of this Instruction.
   6.1.12. Interviewing Medical Personnel. In accordance with DoD 6025.18-R, DoD Health
   Information Privacy Regulation, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
   (HIPAA), the AIB is authorized to interview medical personnel regarding individuals
   involved in the mishap without the authorization of the individual.
   6.1.13. If a witness is known to be represented by an attorney, the AIB legal advisor shall
   contact the attorney prior to the interview rather than contacting the witness.
6.2. Administrative Matters.
   6.2.1. Consider instructing witnesses to bring documents or other items to the interview for
   use during their interview, as necessary. All documents should be the original document if
   possible. Attach all such documents as exhibits to the applicable witness interviews and/or
   statements.
   6.2.2. Verify the suitability and quality of the recording equipment before commencing the
   interviews.
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                 39


6.3. Classified Interviews. Witnesses, AIB members and FAEs, and court reporters or
stenographers must be properly cleared before they may participate in classified interviews.
   6.3.1. Safeguard classified information in accordance with AFPD 31-4. NOTE: A classified
   interview must be conducted using an appropriately classified recording device.
   6.3.2. If classified information is germane to the investigation, conduct two separate
   interviews (one classified and one unclassified) and include as much unclassified testimony
   as possible in the unclassified portion of the report.
   6.3.3. If a classified interview does not yield relevant information, do not transcribe it. The
   AIB will forward the classified recording to the convening authority's SJA in accordance
   with para 9.2.2.1.1.1 of this Instruction.
6.4. Foreign National Interviews. Consult with the convening authority’s SJA for guidance in
arranging, conducting, and documenting interviews with foreign military personnel and foreign
nationals. The convening authority’s SJA shall consult with AF/JAO.
   6.4.1. The host installation’s SJA and host installation’s liaison officer shall assist in
   arranging for an interpreter to participate in interviews of foreign military personnel and
   foreign national witnesses.
6.5. Persons Attending Interviews.
   6.5.1. The AIB president should conduct all interviews.
   6.5.2. The AIB president may allow other AIB members to question the witness during the
   interview. The AIB member questioning the witness shall identify him/herself on the record.
   6.5.3. The AIB legal advisor shall be present during all interviews and ensure proper
   procedures are followed in questioning witnesses, placing them under oath, and advising
   them of their rights.
   6.5.4. Consider which AIB members should attend each interview; it may not be necessary
   to have the entire AIB present for an interview regarding a technical matter.
   6.5.5. A witness, if suspected of a crime or upon his/her request, may have his/her attorney
   present during the AIB interview. However, the witness’s attorney may not ask or answer
   questions on behalf of his/her client.
6.6. Witness Speculation. Witnesses shall not be asked to speculate, guess, or provide an
opinion as to the ultimate cause or causes of the accident. If an expert provides an opinion
within his/her area of expertise, ask for the factual basis of his/her opinion. However,
speculation by expert witnesses should be limited to the facts and circumstances surrounding the
subject accident rather than fleet-wide concerns or Air Force-wide practices.
6.7. Testimony of Absent Witnesses. If a witness is unavailable to interview in person (e.g.,
due to deployment, permanent change of station (PCS), or TDY) conduct a telephone or video
teleconference (VTC) interview.
   6.7.1. Inform all parties to the interview both prior to and on the record that the interview
   will be recorded.
   6.7.2. The witness must consent to being recorded with the AIB’s recording device, and the
   witness may not use his/her own recording device to record the interview.
 40                                                    AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012


   6.7.3. The AIB president or legal advisor shall take appropriate steps to confirm the
   witness’s identity on the record.
   6.7.4. The AIB president or legal advisor or any active duty officer or active duty senior
   non-commissioned officer shall administer the oath or affirmation to the witness on the
   record.
   6.7.5. If the interview is conducted via VTC, it is not necessary to record the video portion
   of the interview. To enable the AIB team to both view and hear a VTC interviewee, the
   interview may be conducted via live-feed VTC with only the audio portion recorded by the
   AIB's recording device.
6.8. Witness Introduction. Use the following witness introduction for all interviews:
   6.8.1. Witnesses who testified before the SIB:
My name is ___________. I am/We are investigating the aircraft/missile
device/UAS/space vehicle accident that occurred on __________, near __________.
This investigation, conducted under AFI 51-503, is separate and apart from the safety
investigation conducted under AFI 91-204. This accident investigation board is a legal
investigation that was convened to inquire into the facts surrounding the
aircraft/aerospace accident, to prepare a publicly-releasable report, and to gather and
preserve all available evidence for use in litigation, claims, disciplinary actions,
administrative proceedings, and for other purposes. A safety investigation was
previously conducted on this accident. Any testimony you gave before the safety
investigation board will be kept confidential, if you were so advised, and can be used
only for accident prevention purposes. This board does not have access to any
confidential testimony you gave before the safety investigation board. You may not state
that you gave any particular information to the safety board under a promise of
confidentiality. Your sworn testimony to me/us may be used for any proper purpose.
Additionally, your testimony can be released to the public. Do you understand the
difference between your testimony before the safety board and this accident board?
   6.8.2. Witnesses who did not testify before the SIB:
My name is ___________. I am/We are investigating the aircraft/missile
device/UAS/space vehicle accident that occurred on __________, near __________.
This investigation, conducted under AFI 51-503, is separate and apart from the safety
investigation conducted under AFI 91-204. This accident investigation board is a legal
investigation that was convened to inquire into the facts surrounding the
aircraft/aerospace accident, to prepare a publicly-releasable report, and to gather and
preserve all available evidence for use in litigation, claims, disciplinary actions,
administrative proceedings, and for other purposes. A safety investigation was
previously conducted on this accident. You did not provide testimony or a statement to
the safety investigation. Your sworn testimony to me/us may be used for any proper
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                 41


purpose. Additionally, your testimony can be released to the public. Do you understand
how your testimony before this accident board may be used?
6.9. Witness Oath.
   6.9.1. Administer the following oath/affirmation before questioning a witness:
Do you solemnly swear/affirm that the testimony you are about to give in the matter now
under investigation shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help
you God?
   6.9.2. NOTE: If a witness chooses to ―affirm,‖ omit the word "solemnly" and phrase "so
   help you God" when administering the oath.
6.10. Recorded Preamble.
   6.10.1. Record both the witness introduction and oath/affirmation. After administering the
   oath or affirmation, the interviewer shall identify the date, time, place of interview, persons
   present, and state the witness has been sworn or affirmed. Then ask the witness to state his
   or her full name, rank, job title, present duty assignment, and location, as appropriate.
   6.10.2. NOTE: The convening authority has discretion to omit names of individuals
   involved in the mishap from the AIB report (to include the narrative portion and all Tabs).
   See para 8.3.12 of this Instruction.
6.11. Adopting SIB Witness Testimony. If a witness’s testimony before the SIB was non-
privileged, the AIB should receive a recording or transcript of the non-privileged testimony.
   6.11.1. During an AIB interview and after the witness has been placed under oath, the AIB
   may ask him/her to adopt prior, non-privileged, SIB testimony, so as to make it a sworn
   statement, before proceeding with additional interview questions. The prior testimony
   should be referenced by date and page number if included in Part I of the SIB. The AIB can
   ask the witness additional questions, as necessary.
   6.11.2. If a SIB witness interview is adopted by the AIB but a transcript or summary of the
   testimony is not included in Tab R, a copy of the prior testimony shall be added to the end of
   the witness's interview within Tab V.
6.12. Rights and Privileges of Witnesses.
   6.12.1. General Guidance. Interviews should still be initiated even if the interviewer expects
   the witness to invoke his or her rights or privileges against self-incrimination, in order to
   make the invocation a matter of record.
   6.12.2. Military Witnesses.
       6.12.2.1. Before the AIB questions a military member suspected of committing an
       offense punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) (10 U.S.C. §§
       801-940), the military member must be advised of his or her rights provided by Articles
       31(a) and (b) of the UCMJ. Use the rights advisement at Figure 6.1 of this Instruction.
       6.12.2.2. Articles 31(a) and (b) of the UCMJ provide that no persons subject to the
       UCMJ may be compelled to incriminate themselves or answer any question the answer to
       which may tend to incriminate them.
 42                                                      AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012


       6.12.2.3. When suspicion of an offense punishable under the UCMJ arises after the
       interview begins, the interview shall be stopped as soon as the suspicion arises, and the
       military member will be advised of his or her rights in Figure 6.1 of this Instruction.
       6.12.2.4. If, after being advised of his or her Article 31, UCMJ rights, the military
       witness requests a lawyer or elects to remain silent, the AIB interviewer shall stop the
       interview and refer the witness to the host installation’s ADC. After the witness has had
       an opportunity to consult with an attorney, the AIB legal advisor shall contact the
       witness’ attorney to inquire whether the witness is willing to testify. If the witness is
       willing to testify, the AIB interviewer shall re-administer the rights advisement on the
       record before questioning the witness. The witness’ attorney may attend the interview
       and provide legal advice to the witness during the interview. However, the attorney may
       not ask or answer questions on behalf of the witness and may not interrupt or improperly
       interfere with the interview.
       6.12.2.5. If a military witness is not suspected of any offense punishable under the
       UCMJ but the witness invokes his or her right against self-incrimination, refer the
       witness to the host installation ADC.
       6.12.2.6. If there is not an ADC available at the host installation, contact the host
       installation’s SJA to obtain contact information for other defense counsel the witness may
       contact.
       6.12.2.7. If, after rights advisement and (if requested) consultation with a defense
       attorney, a military member suspected of committing an offense punishable under the
       UCMJ agrees to testify under oath or affirmation, then the following statement should
       appear immediately before the witness’ testimony:
―Having been duly sworn and advised of the allegations, of [his/her] rights under Article 31,
Uniform Code of Military Justice, and of [his/her] rights to counsel, and having acknowledged
[his/her] understanding of those rights, and having affirmatively waived those rights, the witness
testified as follows:‖
       6.12.2.8. For accidents involving Air Reserve Components (ARC) personnel, the AIB
       president must determine what the duty status of the USAFR or ANG member being
       interviewed was at the time of the accident. The determination must be made prior to the
       interview because different duty statuses require different protections during the
       interview process. Consult the AIB legal advisor for assistance in determining duty
       status and required protections. Include a copy of the witness’ orders, civilian or military
       pay stub, or duty roster for drill days in the post-investigation memorandum. When ARC
       personnel are suspected of a crime, provide the appropriate rights advisement in Figure
       6.1 or Figure 6.2 of this Instruction after verifying the witness’ duty status at the time of
       incident and at the time of the interview. Whenever possible, the AIB should arrange to
       interview the witness at a time he/she is on federal military status.
   6.12.3. Federal Civilian Employee Witnesses.
       6.12.3.1. General Considerations.
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                               43


        6.12.3.1.1. Consult with the host installation’s SJA and a labor relations officer for
        guidance prior to interviewing federal civilian witnesses covered by a bargaining unit.
        NOTE: Many Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs) are represented by bargaining units.
        6.12.3.1.2. You may ask employees if they are members of a certified bargaining
        unit. However, it is improper to ask employees whether they belong to a union for
        purposes of determining whether they have Weingarten rights. (See para 6.12.3.2.1.1
        of this Instruction.)
     6.12.3.2. Union Participation. If a civilian employee is a member of a certified
     bargaining unit represented by a labor organization, a union official or representative may
     have the right to be present during the interview depending upon whether the interview
     constitutes a disciplinary examination or a formal discussion. During a disciplinary
     examination, the employee may have a right to have a union representative present.
     During a formal discussion, the union may have a right to have a union representative
     present.
        6.12.3.2.1. Disciplinary Examinations.
            6.12.3.2.1.1. If the employee is a member of a certified bargaining unit
            represented by a labor organization and both (1) reasonably believes that he or she
            might be disciplined as a result of the interview, and (2) requests union
            representation, then the employee is entitled to have a union official or steward
            present during the interview. This right is found in 5 U.S.C. § 7114(a)(2)(B),
            Rights and Duties of Agencies and Labor Organizations, and is frequently
            referred to as the employee’s Weingarten rights, after the Supreme Court decision
            in National Labor Relations Board v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S. 251 (1975).
            6.12.3.2.1.2. If the bargaining unit member requests union representation before
            or during the interview, the interviewer should consult with the host installation’s
            SJA. The interviewer’s options are (1) grant the request, (2) cancel the interview,
            or (3) offer the employee the choice of either conducting the interview
            unaccompanied by a union representative or having no interview at all.
            6.12.3.2.1.3. The right to the presence of a union representative at a disciplinary
            examination is the employee's right, not the union's right. If the employee does
            not ask for a union representative, then the union has no right to demand that a
            representative be present. The right exists for all federal civilian employees who
            are members of a certified bargaining unit, whether they are members of the union
            or not.
            6.12.3.2.1.4. The Civil Service Reform Act does not require employee
            notification of the right to representation prior to each interview. Rather, the Act
            requires management annually inform its employees of this right. However, some
            local union contracts stipulate that management officials of an installation shall
            provide notice before each interview. Exercise caution when interviewing federal
            civilian employees to ensure there are no violations of the terms of a local
            contract.
        6.12.3.2.2. Formal Discussions.
44                                                    AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012


            6.12.3.2.2.1. Under the provisions of the Federal Sector Labor Management
            Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. § 7114(a)(2)(A), Rights and Duties of Agencies and
            Labor Organizations, unions have a right to be given notice of a formal
            discussion between one or more agency representatives and one or more
            bargaining unit employees. However, in most circumstances, an investigatory
            interview with a civilian bargaining unit employee is not a formal discussion that
            would require advance notice to the union and an opportunity for a union official
            to attend the interview. This is because the labor statute provision only applies to
            discussions that concern a grievance, personnel policy or practice, or other
            general condition of employment. These terms are defined broadly by the Federal
            Labor Relations Authority. These are not normally the subjects of an AIB witness
            interview, which more likely would seek to establish an employee’s specific
            actions, conduct, and observations relevant to the mishap at issue. However,
            questions about workplace actions, the workplace atmosphere, or general
            environment of the work center (e.g., how often did personnel use government
            owned or leased vehicles for personal use) are considered discussions about
            ―general conditions of employment.‖
            6.12.3.2.2.2. The employee must be advised of his/her Brookhaven rights (e.g.,
            certain safeguards set out by the Federal Labor Relations Authority to protect
            employees from coercive questioning concerning matters involving their
            statutorily protected rights).
            6.12.3.2.2.3. If there is any question whether an interview might constitute a
            formal discussion, which would require union notice, the AIB legal advisor
            should consult with the host installation’s SJA or the Labor Law Field Support
            Center at the Civil Litigation Division, AFLOA (AFLOA/JACL).
     6.12.3.3. Rights Advisements.
        6.12.3.3.1. If the AIB decides to interview witnesses suspected of committing a
        violation of a criminal law, consult the convening authority’s SJA for guidance on
        how to proceed. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides
        rights to persons who are not subject to the UCMJ. The convening authority’s SJA
        should consider whether to consult with the host installation’s SJA in order to
        determine whether or not civilian criminal investigators should become involved. If
        the AIB president decides to interview the witness under such circumstances, first
        advise the witness of his or her Constitutional right against self-incrimination. See
        Figure 6.2 of this Instruction.
        6.12.3.3.2. If the witness is willing to testify, the AIB interviewer shall re-administer
        the rights advisement on the record before questioning the witness. The witness’
        attorney may attend the interview and provide legal advice to the witness during the
        interview. However, the attorney may not ask or answer questions on behalf of the
        witness and may not interrupt or improperly interfere with the interview.
        6.12.3.3.3. If after rights advisement, the civilian employee agrees to testify under
        oath or affirmation, then the following statement should appear immediately before
        the witness’ testimony:
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                   45


―Having been duly sworn and advised of [his/her] rights under the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States, and of [his/her] rights to counsel, and having acknowledged
[his/her] understanding of those rights, and having affirmatively waived those rights, the witness
testified as follows:‖
       6.12.3.4. An individual may have both union representation and legal counsel present
       during an interview. A union official, steward, other representative, or attorney attending
       an AIB witness interview may advise the federal employee who is being interviewed, but
       may not ask or answer questions on behalf of the witness, and may not interrupt or
       improperly interfere with the interview.
   6.12.4. DoD Contractor Employee Witnesses.
       6.12.4.1. The AIB president may choose to have an Air Force contract management
       representative present when interviewing employees of DoD contractors. The contract
       management representative may be able to help obtain company records, company
       policies, and applicable contract provisions. In addition, this representative may provide
       assistance if the employee contends that rights under a contractor’s labor-management
       agreement are being abridged.
       6.12.4.2. Rights Advisements.
           6.12.4.2.1. If the AIB decides to interview witnesses suspected of committing a
           violation of a criminal law, consult the convening authority’s SJA for guidance on
           how to proceed. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides
           rights to persons that are not subject to the UCMJ. The convening authority’s SJA
           should consider whether to consult with the host installation’s SJA in order to
           determine whether or not civilian criminal investigators should become involved. If
           the AIB president decides to interview the witness under such circumstances, the
           witness shall be advised of his or her Constitutional right against self-incrimination.
           See Figure 6.2 of this Instruction.
           6.12.4.2.2. If the witness is willing to testify, the AIB interviewer shall re-administer
           the rights advisement on the record before questioning the witness. The witness’
           attorney may attend the interview and provide legal advice to the witness during the
           interview. However, the attorney may not ask or answer questions on behalf of the
           witness, and may not interrupt or improperly interfere with the interview.
           6.12.4.2.3. If after rights advisement, the contractor employee agrees to testify under
           oath or affirmation, then the following statement should appear immediately before
           the witness’ testimony:
―Having been duly sworn and advised of [his/her] rights under the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States, and of [his/her] rights to counsel, and having acknowledged
[his/her] understanding of those rights, and having affirmatively waived those rights, the witness
testified as follows:‖
   6.12.5. Other Witnesses.
 46                                                      AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012


       6.12.5.1. The AIB president should allow other witnesses to bring appropriate advisors
       to an interview. However, only the AIB members may ask questions, and only the
       witness may answer questions during the interview.
       6.12.5.2. Rights Advisements.
           6.12.5.2.1. If the AIB decides to interview witnesses suspected of committing a
           violation of a criminal law, consult the convening authority’s SJA for guidance on
           how to proceed. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides
           rights to persons who are not subject to the UCMJ. The convening authority’s SJA
           should consider whether to consult with the host installation’s SJA in order to
           determine whether or not civilian criminal investigators should become involved. If
           the AIB president decides to interview the witness under such circumstances, first
           advise the witness of his or her Constitutional right against self-incrimination. See
           Figure 6.2 of this Instruction.
           6.12.5.2.2. If the witness is willing to testify, the AIB interviewer shall re-administer
           the rights advisement on the record before questioning the witness. The witness’
           attorney may attend the interview and provide legal advice to the witness during the
           interview. However, the attorney may not ask or answer questions on behalf of the
           witness, and may not interrupt or improperly interfere with the interview.
           6.12.5.2.3. If after rights advisement, the civilian witness agrees to testify under oath
           or affirmation, then the following statement should appear immediately before the
           witness’ testimony:
―Having been duly sworn and advised of [his/her] rights under the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States, and of [his/her] rights to counsel, and having acknowledged
[his/her] understanding of those rights, and having affirmatively waived those rights, the witness
testified as follows:‖
       6.12.5.3. Consult the convening authority’s SJA for guidance on interviewing foreign
       military personnel and foreign nationals that the AIB interviewer suspects, or comes to
       suspect, of acting in violation of United States (federal and state) criminal laws or the
       criminal laws of the witness’ country of citizenship.
6.13. Concluding the Interview.
   6.13.1. Conclude each interview by reminding the witness on the record of the official nature
   of the interview and instruct him/her to refrain from discussing his/her testimony with
   anyone without the AIB president’s permission until the AIB report has been released to the
   public.
   6.13.2. Expect to recall some witnesses. Subsequent testimony from other witnesses may
   cause you to seek clarification of previous testimony. For this reason, consider retaining
   witnesses in the local area until they are no longer needed for further interviews.
6.14. Verbatim or Summarized Testimony. Preserve all witness testimony with audio
recording. Thereafter, testimony can be transcribed verbatim, or summarized and signed by the
witness.
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                   47


   6.14.1. If the AIB elects to summarize a witness’ testimony, take notes during the interview
   and draft a coherent, accurate summary. See Attachment 2, Figure A2.21 of this Instruction
   for a recommended format for summarized testimony.
   6.14.2. The witness’s identity must be confirmed, and he/she must sign the summarized
   statement as a sworn statement in the presence of an active duty officer or active duty senior
   non-commissioned officer.
   6.14.3. If a witness declines to sign a summarized statement on the grounds it does not
   accurately reflect his or her testimony, review the audio recording and notes with the witness
   and reach an agreement on what the witness said or intended. It is important the witness
   concurs with the summarized statement of his or her testimony. If you cannot reach an
   agreement, transcribe the testimony verbatim instead.
   6.14.4. Package and label all audio recordings. Send them to the convening authority’s SJA
   with the post-investigation memorandum.
6.15. Witness Testimony Format. Witness statements are included in Tab V of the AIB report.
Double space between questions. Number all questions and answers (Q1/A1, Q2/A2, etc.).
Paginate all testimony (V-1 for first witness, V-2 for second witness, V-3 for third witness, etc.).
Internally paginate the testimony of each witness (V-1.1, V-1.2, V-1.3, V-2.1, V-2.2, etc.).

                                            Chapter 7

                      EARLY PUBLIC RELEASE OF INFORMATION

7.1. General Considerations.
   7.1.1. Conducting a thorough and timely investigation is a high priority for the Air Force,
   NoK, seriously injured personnel, and the public. Procedures and policy for releasing
   information are in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 2254, Treatment of Reports of Aircraft
   Investigations, and this Instruction.
   7.1.2. Unauthorized Disclosure of Mishap Information. Unauthorized disclosure of
   information or documents gathered during the AIB investigation compromises the integrity
   of the AIB process.
   7.1.3. Specific Prohibition. Prior to the official public release of the AIB report, AIB
   members, FAEs, contractors, and federal government employees who have been given or
   have obtained access to AIB information or documents are prohibited from disclosing that
   information or the contents of the AIB report for other than official and authorized purposes.
   Prior to public release of the AIB report, the only authorized disclosures of AIB information
   or the contents of an AIB report are for the purpose of facilitating the AIB investigation.
   Any other disclosures must be specifically approved by the convening authority’s SJA. This
   restriction does not apply to information or documents released under para 7.2 of this
   Instruction.
       7.1.3.1. Failure to observe the prohibition in para 7.1.3 of this Instruction by active duty
       Air Force members, USAFR members on active duty or inactive duty for training, or
       ANG members in federal service, is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ. Violations by
       federal civilian employees may result in administrative disciplinary actions without
       regard to otherwise applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws.
       7.1.3.2. This prohibition does not preclude the AIB from seeking information from any
       source during the investigation process to include disclosing information to a witness in
       order to fully develop questioning. In such cases, the witness shall be instructed not to
       disclose any information learned during the interview.
7.2. Early Release of Factual Information. When the requirements of 10 U.S.C. § 2254, listed
under para 7.2.1 of this Instruction, have been satisfied, the convening authority, or his/her SJA
unless such authority is withheld, shall authorize the public disclosure of unclassified recordings,
scientific reports, and other factual information regarding the accident prior to public release of
the AIB report. However, the requirements of para 7.2.1 of this Instruction shall not limit the
convening authority’s ability to release factual information prior to public release of the AIB
report when the convening authority deems it appropriate.
   7.2.1. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 2254, early release of factual information shall occur
   if:
       7.2.1.1. The information is requested; and
       7.2.1.2. The information will be included in the releasable AIB report; and
 50                                                     AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012


       7.2.1.3. The release of such information will not undermine the ability of safety or
       accident investigators to continue to conduct the investigation; and
       7.2.1.4. The release of such information will not compromise national security.
   7.2.2. The AIB president shall coordinate early release of factual information with the
   convening authority's SJA and PA. In high-interest mishaps (defined in para 7.5.1 of this
   Instruction), also comply with para 7.5 of this Instruction.
   7.2.3. If the accident involved personnel from other MAJCOMs, other DoD components,
   allied forces, or if it involved prominent public officials, it may be necessary or appropriate
   to advise organizations and officials outside the convening authority’s command prior to
   approving the public release of factual information under 10 U.S.C. § 2254. Consult with the
   convening authority’s SJA and PA and with AFLOA/JACC for additional guidance if an
   unusual situation arises.
7.3. Releasing AIB Procedural Status Information. It is important to keep NoK, seriously
injured personnel, and the public apprised of AIB procedural status information, such as the start
of each phase of the investigation, SAR, recovery of remains, salvage operations, etc. To this
end, make contact with the FLO shortly after arriving at the host installation. AIB procedural
status information does not include substantive findings of the AIB.
   7.3.1. Command authorities may release AIB procedural status information to the extent
   such releases will have no effect or bearing on the ongoing SIB or AIB investigation and do
   not conflict with command policy. Releasing AIB procedural status information for high-
   interest (defined in para 7.5.1 of this Instruction) mishaps does not require Headquarters Air
   Force notification in accordance with para 7.5.3 of this Instruction prior to release. However,
   NoK and seriously injured personnel shall be notified by the FLO prior to release of any AIB
   procedural status information to the public or media.
   7.3.2. If the accident involved personnel from other MAJCOMs, other DoD components,
   allied forces, or if it involved prominent public officials, it may be necessary or appropriate
   to advise organizations and officials outside the convening authority’s command prior to
   approving the public release of procedural status information. Consult with the convening
   authority’s SJA and PA and with AFLOA/JACC for additional guidance if an unusual
   situation arises.
   7.3.3. The AIB may create a web site containing AIB procedural status information;
   however, information should be posted on the web site only after it has been provided to
   NoK or seriously injured personnel.
   7.3.4. The AIB may conduct a press conference or issue a press release; however, release
   information in this manner only after providing it to NoK or seriously injured personnel.
7.4. Release of Specific Accident Investigation Details.
   7.4.1. The AIB president is responsible for the public release of all information regarding the
   investigation, to include the release of factual information regarding the accident.
   7.4.2. Releasing AIB-specific accident investigation details does not require prior approval
   from the convening authority or notice to the Headquarters Air Force unless it involves a
   high-interest mishap (defined in para 7.5.1 of this Instruction). In high-interest mishaps,
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                   51


   comply with para 7.5.3 of this Instruction prior to releasing this information to the NoK,
   seriously injured personnel, or the public.
   7.4.3. Releasing specific accident investigation details to NoK or seriously injured personnel
   constitutes public release. Therefore, always coordinate release of accident investigation
   details with the convening authority’s SJA and PA, even if such release is to NoK or
   seriously injured personnel.
   7.4.4. In relaying specific accident investigation details to NoK, seriously injured personnel,
   and the public, use the following guidance:
      7.4.4.1. Use FLOs from the mishap wing rather than the AIB president or members to
      provide investigation details to NoK and seriously injured personnel to avoid a situation
      where the AIB members could be perceived to have lost their objectivity with regard to
      the investigation. Ideally, AIB members should only contact NoK or seriously injured
      personnel to initially introduce themselves, to conduct formal interviews, or to perform
      post-investigation briefings.
7.5. High-Interest Mishaps.
   7.5.1. High-interest mishaps include those that result in death or serious personal injury,
   significant civilian property damage, or are likely to generate high public, media, or
   congressional interest.
   7.5.2. In high-interest mishap cases, early release of specific accident investigation details
   requires approval from the convening authority and notice to the Headquarters Air Force,
   followed by notification to NoK and seriously injured personnel, prior to public release.
   7.5.3. Prior to releasing specific accident investigation detail information to the NoK,
   seriously injured personnel, and the public, the convening authority’s SJA shall forward such
   information by e-mail or fax to AFLOA/JACC for immediate distribution through The Judge
   Advocate General to the Air Force Chief of Staff (AF/CC) and Secretary of the Air Force
   (SECAF) and/or their designees for review. Upon receipt, the aforementioned organizations
   shall have two duty days to review the information after which AFLOA/JACC shall notify
   the convening authority’s SJA the release can be made.
   7.5.4. In fatality mishaps, the AIB president may initiate a release of status information on
   the investigations following arrival at the accident scene (or the location where the SIB is
   based). See Attachment 2, Figure A2.17 of this Instruction.
      7.5.4.1. If the first release of status information on the investigation substantially follows
      the example found at Attachment 2, Figure A2.17 of this Instruction, and no specific
      investigation information is added, the prior notification and approval requirement of
      para 7.5.3 of this Instruction does not apply.

                                            Chapter 8

                                      THE AIB REPORT

8.1. Overview.
   8.1.1. The AIB report is comprised of six sections: the cover sheet, three separate written
   sections (the Executive Summary, the Summary of Facts, and the Statement of Opinion), the
   Index of Tabs, and the Tabs which contain supporting documentation.
       8.1.1.1. Each of the three written sections should be self-contained meaning each section
       reiterates the facts of the mishap to the extent necessary for that particular section (e.g.,
       basic facts in the Executive Summary, thorough discussion of facts in Summary of Facts,
       and facts that support the cause(s) and/or substantially contributing factor(s) for the
       Statement of Opinion). Re-define acronyms and aviation concepts in each section.
   8.1.2. Report Format. The report format described in this Chapter is applicable for all AIBs.
   Modify it only to the extent allowed in Ch 11 and Ch 12 of this Instruction.
8.2. Assembling the Report. Assemble the completed report on 8 1/2 inch x 11 inch paper
secured either at the top or on the left side in a three-ring binder.
   8.2.1. The cover sheet, Executive Summary, Summary of Facts (with Table of Contents and
   List of Commonly Used Acronyms and Abbreviations), and the Statement of Opinion shall
   be single sided. The Tab sections should normally be double-sided. If the report is secured
   at the top, ensure all double-sided copies are printed head to foot.
   8.2.2. Excluding the cover sheet, Executive Summary, and any SIB Part I portion (Tabs A
   through S), all pages of the AIB report should have a centered footer in 11 point italicized
   font indicating the airframe, tail number, and date of the mishap on one line and page number
   on the next line.
       8.2.2.1. The SIB Part I portion included in the AIB report may have a different
       header/footer, and the AIB should not alter it.
   8.2.3. If there is no formal SIB report, insert the appropriate, non-privileged evidence
   received from the safety investigation in the relevant Tabs A through S of the AIB report.
   8.2.4. If the AIB report is secured at the top, the thickness of each hardcopy volume may not
   exceed two (2) inches. If the AIB report is secured in a three-ring binder and the report
   exceeds the thickness of the binder, assemble it in multiple volumes. Label the volumes
   (e.g., 1 of 2, 2 of 2).
   8.2.5. Upon the convening authority’s approval of the AIB report, the convening authority’s
   SJA may reduce the report to an electronic file. However, NoK and seriously injured
   personnel shall be offered hard copies of the report.
8.3. Publicly-Releasable Report. Include only publicly-releasable information in the AIB
report. If questions arise regarding releasability, contact the convening authority’s SJA. Do not
include the following items in the report:
   8.3.1. Privileged safety information. See Attachment 1 of this Instruction for the definition
   of ―privileged safety information.‖
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                  53


  8.3.2. Information required to be withheld under the FOIA, such as sensitive personal
  identifying information, to include Social Security Numbers, birth dates, ages, home
  addresses, and home telephone numbers that appear in documents. See DoD Regulation
  5400.7/AF Supplement and AFI 33-332.
  8.3.2.1. Remove non relevant information concerning persons not involved in the mishap
  event from the Tab materials (e.g., redact the non-mishap parties from the letter of Xs, redact
  non-mishap parties from training attendee lists, redact names from previous/post non-mishap
  related sorties, and be selective of which maintenance records and maintenance training
  records should be included).
  8.3.3. Information protected by the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. § 2751, et seq.) and
  the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. app. 2401, et seq.) These
  statutes apply to TOs, flight checklist/manual information, and engineering/analysis reports.
     8.3.3.1. Obtain written approval from the technical content manager (TCM) listed as the
     OPR before including extracts of these publications in the report. Include the TCM’s
     written approval with the excerpt in an AIB Tab and as an attachment to the post-
     investigation memorandum. See para 5.4.2.4 and para 8.7.8.5 of this Instruction.
     8.3.3.2. The convening authority’s SJA may have a TCM review the entire AIB report
     after it is submitted for final review. See para 10.1.2 of this Instruction. Alternatively, if
     a TCM final review at the MAJCOM level is not anticipated, the AIB legal advisor may
     consider asking the TCM to review the SIB Part I to ensure all technical data has been
     approved for public release.
  8.3.4. For Official Use Only (FOUO), CUMI and similar markings. Confirm that all
  documents in the AIB report are appropriate for public release. Ensure FOUO, CUMI and
  similar markings are removed from any documents included in the AIB report.
  8.3.5. Contractor proprietary data. Do not include proprietary data unless the AIB obtains
  written approval from the contractor for release of such information. If written approval is
  granted remove ―proprietary‖ demarcation and include a copy of the release authorization
  with the document in an AIB Tab and as an attachment to the post-investigation
  memorandum.
  8.3.6. Recommendations or suggested corrective actions. Use caution when identifying the
  lack of a specific procedure, remedy, or solution as a causal factor. Such ―causes‖ can
  amount to inappropriate recommendations or suggested corrective actions in disguise.
  8.3.7. Original personnel, training, medical, or flight records of mishap personnel. If
  releasable under FOIA, copies of these documents may be included in the Tabs. The
  originals must be returned to the proper record custodians when the AIB has completed its
  investigation.
  8.3.8. Audio recordings of radio communications with Air Force or FAA ATC. Transcripts
  may be released.
  8.3.9. Any graphic description of injuries, to include those descriptions routinely found in
  autopsy protocols, medical records, human remains scatter diagrams, or photographs
  showing human remains.
54                                                     AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012


  8.3.10. Any document that estimates or gives monetary damage amounts of potential or
  actual third-party claims against the government. Coordinate with the General Torts Branch
  at AFLOA/JACC to ensure they have received this information.
  8.3.11. Classified information. See para 5.4.3 and para 6.3 of this Instruction.
  8.3.12. When possible, names of individuals involved in a mishap event should be disclosed
  in the AIB report. However, DoD policy and federal law (The FOIA) requires names not to
  be released if it is determined doing so would or could constitute a clearly unwarranted
  invasion of personal privacy that is not outweighed by the public’s right to know how the Air
  Force performs its statutory mission. Usually, names of witnesses not involved in the mishap
  – particularly non-employee civilian witnesses – will not be included in the publicly-
  releasable report as their names in and of themselves provide no information of how the Air
  Force conducts its mission. The inclusion of mishap personnel, AIB members, and witness
  names in the publicly-releasable AIB report shall be consistent with DoD policy on the
  release of DoD personnel names, The FOIA, and privacy concerns. The AIB legal advisor
  shall consult with the convening authority’s SJA with regards to whether names of
  individuals involved in a mishap event will be included in the AIB report.
     8.3.12.1. Additionally, for DoD personnel in overseas, sensitive, or routinely-deployable
     units, personally identifiable information, including names, may be withheld. The FOIA
     office for the Information Management Operations Branch, Headquarters Chief
     Information Office (HAF/IMII) maintains an updated list of overseas, sensitive, and
     routinely deployable units that are covered under this policy, which is based on 10 U.S.C.
     § 130b. The list may also be obtained through AF/JAA.
         8.3.12.1.1. According to 10 U.S.C. § 130b, ―personally identifying information,‖
         with respect to any person, means the person’s name, rank, duty address, and official
         title and information regarding the person’s pay.
         8.3.12.1.2. According to DoD 5400.11-R, Department of Defense Privacy Program,
         ―personally identifiable information‖ means information which can be used to
         distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as their name, Social Security
         Number, date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, biometric records, including
         any other personal information which is linked or linkable to a specified individual.
     8.3.12.2. If names of individuals involved in the mishap are omitted from the AIB report,
     include an attachment to the post-investigation memorandum listing their names, their
     Social Security Numbers, contact information, and a FOIA analysis provided by the
     convening authority’s SJA supporting the name omissions.
         8.3.12.2.1. Omitted names shall be replaced by job identifiers or roles in the mishap
         such as, mishap pilot, mishap navigator, mishap sensor operator, witness 1, etc.
  8.3.13. Signatures. Remove all or part of all signatures from the report so the actual
  signature cannot be misused. If the signature is relevant to the mishap or investigation and
  the entire signature is removed, replace it with a marking that states, ―signed.‖ If the
  signature is not relevant, it may be removed entirely.
     8.3.13.1. The signature of the board president is not removed from the copy of the report
     provided to the NoK or seriously injured personnel.
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                  55

   accident in a narrative style. Explain all technical terms in the report for the general public.
   Anticipate the audience will not have a technical background.
   8.7.2. The proper length of the Summary of Facts varies with each accident. Given the
   different types of possible accidents and the varying amounts of information available, there
   is no standard length for the Summary of Facts.
   8.7.3. The Summary of Facts shall be single spaced on single-sided pages.
   8.7.4. The Summary of Facts shall be fully supported by documentary evidence in the Tabs.
   Following each fact stated in the Summary of Facts, a parenthetical reference shall reference
   the source document in the Tabs. For example, ―Several witnesses observed lightning strikes
   just before the accident (Tabs V-1.6, V-4.9, V-5.16)‖ or ―Air Weather Service reports
   indicated severe thunderstorms in the area at the time (Tab W-3).‖
   8.7.5. Do not include opinions regarding the cause of the accident in the Summary of Facts.
   8.7.6. The Summary of Facts should be self-contained. A reader should not have to refer to
   any other documents to understand the complete story of the accident. Include the date of the
   accident, precise location, type of airframe and tail number of the aircraft, unit and unit
   location, names of crewmembers and passengers (and their respective units and unit
   locations), and the monetary value of government loss. See para 8.3.12.1 of this Instruction
   regarding withholding names of personnel assigned to overseas, sensitive, or routinely
   deployable units.
   8.7.7. Scope of the Summary of Facts. The Summary of Facts must be comprehensive
   enough to meet the composition requirements below, yet remain within the designated scope
   of the AIB. See para 1.3 of this Instruction.
   8.7.8. Outline of the Summary of Facts. Use the following outline to construct the Summary

AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                 61


8.8. Statement of Opinion. One of the primary objectives of the accident investigation is to
formulate an opinion as to the cause(s) and/or substantially contributing factor(s) of mishap as
required by 10 U.S.C. § 2254(c). The opinion is publicly-releasable along with the rest of the
AIB report. The opinion must be clear, complete, and concise. It should be written in the first
person and reference specific facts supporting the conclusion.
   8.8.1. Scope of the Statement of Opinion. The opinion should be no more than three pages
   and offer a brief re-cap of the mishap mission focusing on cause(s) and/or substantially
   contributing factor(s). The opinion shall be within the scope of the AIB (See para 1.3 of this
   Instruction). Any opinion as to cause(s) or substantially contributing factor(s) must be
   supported by facts stated in the Summary of Facts, which must be supported by evidence
   included in the Tabs, unless otherwise restricted.
   8.8.2. The legal standard must be clearly stated, e.g. ―I find by clear and convincing
   evidence that the cause of the mishap was ….‖ and/or ―I find by a preponderance of evidence
   that each of the following factors substantially contributed to the mishap….‖ See para 8.8.4
   of this Instruction.
   8.8.3. Liability and Litigation. The opinion is not considered an admission of liability by the
   United States or by any person referred to therein, and may not be considered as evidence in
   any civil or criminal proceeding arising from the aerospace accident (See 10 U.S.C. §
   2254(d)). At the beginning of the Statement of Opinion, include the statement provided in
   para 8.5.10 of this Instruction.
   8.8.4. Standard of Proof.
       8.8.4.1. Cause. Provide an opinion regarding the cause(s) of the mishap only when clear
       and convincing evidence supports the opinion.
           8.8.4.1.1. Each individual mishap cause cited must be supported by clear and
           convincing evidence.
           8.8.4.1.2. Clear and convincing evidence means the accident investigator was able to
           reach a conclusion without serious or substantial doubt. In other words, the opinion
           must be supported by credible evidence that shows it is highly probable that the
           conclusion is correct. However, clear and convincing evidence does not mean that
           another person, looking at the same facts, may not reach a different conclusion.
           8.8.4.1.3. The AIB president shall consult the legal advisor to determine if available
           evidence meets the clear and convincing standard of proof.
       8.8.4.2. Substantially Contributing Factors. If the AIB president is unable to determine a
       cause, he/she shall describe the factors, if any, which substantially contributed to the
       mishap. In cases where the AIB president is able to determine the cause(s) of the mishap,
       he/she may also describe substantially contributing factors.
           8.8.4.2.1. Explain the connection between each substantially contributing factor and
           the mishap.
           8.8.4.2.2. Each substantially contributing factor must be supported by a
           preponderance of the evidence.

          8.8.4.2.3. Preponderance of evidence is the greater weight of credible evidence. That
          evidence that, when fairly considered, produces the stronger impression and is more
          convincing as to its truth when weighed against the opposing evidence.
       8.8.4.3. Evidence Considered.     When weighing the evidence, consider all available
       evidence including:
          8.8.4.3.1. Direct evidence, e.g., that is based on actual knowledge or observation of
          witnesses, and
          8.8.4.3.2. Indirect evidence, e.g., facts or statements from which reasonable
          inferences, deductions, and conclusions may be drawn to establish an unobserved
          fact, knowledge, or state of mind.
       8.8.4.4. Weighing Evidence. The weight of the evidence is not determined by the
       number of witnesses or exhibits but by considering all the evidence and evaluating
       factors such as a witness’ behavior, opportunity for knowledge, information possessed,
       ability to recall and relate events, and relationship to the matter being considered.
   8.8.5. Format, Signature, and Date.
       8.8.5.1. The Statement of Opinion shall begin on a new page, and be single spaced on
       single-sided pages.
       8.8.5.2. The AIB president shall date and sign the Statement of Opinion as "President,
       Accident Investigation Board."
8.9. Index of Tabs.
   8.9.1. The Index of Tabs is inserted in the report after the Statement of Opinion. Also, the
   first page of each Tab shall include an index of sub-tabs, if applicable. For example, under
   Tab V there might be an index of sub-tabs, as follows:

                            POST-INVESTIGATION MATTERS

9.1. Personal Notes and Drafts. After the convening authority approves the AIB report, the
AIB president will instruct all AIB members to destroy all investigation-related notes, emails,
and draft reports. Following approval of the AIB report, the only investigation-related records
that should exist are the approved AIB report and the ancillary documents/evidence forwarded to
the convening authority’s SJA with the post-investigation memorandum.
9.2. Post-Investigation Memorandum. Forward the post-investigation memorandum and
ancillary evidence to the convening authority’s SJA no later than 15 calendar days of forwarding
the completed AIB report to the convening authority’s SJA. The investigation process is not
complete until AIB members have returned original records to the proper custodians, disposed of
or transferred custody of wreckage, and forwarded the post-investigation memorandum with
ancillary documents/evidence to the convening authority’s SJA.
   9.2.1. Purpose of the Memorandum. The memorandum serves as a formal record of
   transmittal of all investigative evidence and documents to the convening authority’s SJA.
   The memorandum consists of a cover letter with attachments. It should be properly marked
   ―PERSONAL DATA – PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 (5 U.S.C. § 552a)‖ in recognition of
   witness and AIB member personal information. See Attachment 2, Figure A2.11 of this
   Instruction.
   9.2.2. Attachments. Attach the following documents to the post-investigation memorandum:
       9.2.2.1. Evidence Inventory. Inventory all documents, audiocassettes, videotapes, etc.,
       being forwarded to the convening authority’s SJA. If some items are not releasable under
       the FOIA (such as autopsy photos, Privacy Act information, Arms Export Control Act
       information, and the Export Administration Act of 1979), clearly identify and segregate
       those items on the inventory.
           9.2.2.1.1. Forward original documents regarding destroyed aircraft or deceased
           mishap personnel; video recordings; audio recordings of witness interviews;
           photographs; and digital media. Original records such as medical, dental, and
           personnel and training records should be returned to the proper record custodians.
           9.2.2.1.2. If a classified interview was conducted, forward the classified recording
           separately in accordance with the proper guidance for forwarding classified
           information.
           9.2.2.1.3. File the documents in an appropriate box. Place each document or item in
           a labeled or numbered file folder or envelope so it is easily identifiable and
           retrievable. Label boxes with date of accident, location of accident, convening
           authority, aircraft tail number, and item numbers contained therein (e.g., Box 2 of 3,
           containing Items #42 - #86). Include in each box an inventory sheet. A sample
           inventory sheet is at Attachment 2, Figure A2.12 of this Instruction.

       historically significant.
   9.3.2. Unless there are pending claims or litigation, the ancillary documents and evidence
   gathered by the AIB should be returned to the source agency or disposed of in accordance
   with applicable regulations. Consult with the convening authority’s SJA and AFLOA/JACC
   to determine if further retention is warranted.

   addition, ensure compliance with other applicable instructions, including AFMAN 23-110,
   Volume 6 prior to disposal.
9.7. Request for Authorization to Repair Aircraft, UAS, Missile, or Space Vehicle. No
aircraft, UAS, missile, or space vehicle involved in a Class A mishap shall be repaired and
returned to service until AFLOA/JACC releases it from legal hold. However, if the mishap
resulted solely in damage to government property and did not involve loss of an Air Force
aircraft, UAS, missile, or space vehicle, the convening authority’s SJA may authorize repair and
return to service.
9.8. Release of Aero Club Aircraft Wreckage and Ancillary Documents. Retain all Aero

10.1. Formal Staffing and Legal Review. The convening authority’s SJA staffs the AIB report
to the appropriate staff offices for comments (See Attachment 2, Figure A2.6 and Figure A2.7 of
this Instruction), forwards comments to the AIB president, receives any revisions, completes a
final legal review, and forwards the AIB report to the convening authority within 30 days when
possible. The legal review assesses whether the AIB report meets the requirements of this
Instruction and addresses legal issues, including potential or pending claims and litigation. The
legal review is forwarded with the AIB report to the convening authority, but is not publicly-
releasable and is not incorporated into the AIB report.
   10.1.1. Prior to the convening authority’s approval, the AIB report may not be provided to

subject to undue influence, real or perceived, by members of the convening authority’s staff.
10.3. Approval of the AIB Report. The convening authority reviews the AIB report, and
decides whether to approve the report as written, approve it with comments, or return it to the
AIB president for further action. See Attachment 2, Figure A2.9 of this Instruction for required
format of the convening authority’s approval action.
   10.3.1. Approval of the AIB report does not indicate the convening authority agrees with the

commander (or civilian equivalent) before briefing the convening authority. In addition, the
NAF commander (or civilian equivalent) may invite the mishap wing commander to be present
at the informational briefing. The purpose of this informational briefing is not to critique the
AIB report but to prepare the NAF commander (or civilian equivalent) and the wing commander
for the formal briefing with the convening authority. The NAF commander (or civilian
equivalent) may forward any written comments on the report to the convening authority
following the informational briefing.
10.6. Distributing the AIB Report: Other than High-Interest Mishaps.

                    ABBREVIATED ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS

11.1. General Considerations. At the convening authority's discretion, AIB procedures may be
modified and the format of the AIB report abbreviated, as necessary, to conserve time and
resources. This discretion may be exercised only under the following circumstances:
   11.1.1. When an AIB is required pursuant to para 1.5 of this Instruction and the mishap is
   not a high-interest mishap and involves a propeller-driven unmanned aerial vehicle (other
   than a sub-scale remotely piloted vehicle) or a Full Scale Aerial Target Remotely Piloted
   Vehicle (FSAT RPV) and claims, litigation, disciplinary or adverse administrative action,
   serious personal injury or death are not likely or expected to arise from the mishap.
   11.1.2. When convening an AIB is discretionary. See para 1.6 of this Instruction regarding
   factors to consider when determining whether to convene a discretionary AIB.
   11.1.3. When the SIB does not produce a formal two-part report (engine-confined incidents,
   miscellaneous air operation mishaps, etc.).
11.2. Abbreviated AIB Member Qualifications.
   11.2.1. The AIB president should be in a grade equal to, or greater than, the grade of the
   corresponding SIB president or, in the case of a single SIB investigator, the grade of the IO.
   11.2.2. In cases where a single SIB investigator is appointed in lieu of a full board, an AIB
   president and legal advisor should be appointed to the subsequent Abbreviated AIB.
   Consider appointing a recorder, other board members, and FAEs, as needed.
   11.2.3. The AIB president need not be a graduate of the Board President’s Course.
   However, the AIB president should be a graduate of either the Flight Safety Officer Course
   or the Aircraft Mishap Investigation Course.
   11.2.4. The AIB legal advisor shall be a graduate of the AAIC or its predecessor the
   AIBLAC unless AFLOA/JACC waives the training requirement.
11.3. Convening Authority. The same level of command that convened the corresponding SIB
shall convene the abbreviated AIB.
11.4. Full Scale Aerial Target Remotely Piloted Vehicle (FSAT RPV). In the case of a Class
A unmanned FSAT (aerial drone) mishap:
   11.4.1. An abbreviated AIB may be convened by the appropriate wing or equivalent
   commander if it meets the criteria of para 11.1.1 of this Instruction.
       11.4.1.1. The AIB president need not be a graduate of the Board President’s Course nor
       must he/she meet the rating requirements otherwise mandated in this Instruction.
       However, he/she shall be at least a field grade officer.
   11.4.2. If the Class A mishap results in third party property damage of $50,000 or less and
   no personal injury or death, an AIB investigation is not required. However, some other type
   of legal investigation is required. See para 1.7 of this Instruction.
11.5. Collection of Evidence.
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                               77


   11.5.1. Generally, an abbreviated AIB shall proceed along the same lines as a full scale AIB.
   Physical evidence may be viewed and tested, witnesses interviewed, and FAEs used to
   analyze the facts and data available. However, the documentation required, the number of
   witnesses interviewed, and depth of technical analyses may vary, depending on the
   circumstances.
   11.5.2. Witnesses shall testify under oath.
      11.5.2.1. If it becomes apparent that a rights advisement is necessary, then suspend the
      abbreviated AIB and seek further guidance from the convening authority’s SJA.
      11.5.2.2. Witnesses may be interviewed in-person or telephonically, and the content of
      their testimony can be incorporated in a summarized witness statement or a memorandum
      for record. There is no requirement the witness sign the witness statement.
11.6. Assembling the Abbreviated Report. All reports must have an Executive Summary,
Summary of Facts, and Statement of Opinion. However, the content and amount of supporting
documentation and other evidence may vary.
   11.6.1. When the SIB, or the single investigator, has produced a two-part report, the AIB
   shall incorporate the SIB Part I as Tabs A through S of the AIB report. The remaining Tabs,
   normally Tabs T-BB, may be added, as necessary, but are not mandated. Information that
   would normally be included in these Tabs may be summarized in the Summary of Facts.
   11.6.2. When the SIB, or single investigator, has not produced a two-part report, Tabs may
   be used, as necessary, and in any appropriate format. Information that would normally have
   been included in Tabs A through S should be incorporated into the Summary of Facts of the
   AIB report.
   11.6.3. It must be stated in the ―Authority‖ paragraph of the Summary of Facts, and on the
   title page, that the investigation is an ―Abbreviated Accident Investigation, conducted
   pursuant to Chapter 11 of AFI 51-503.‖
11.7. Approval, Distribution, and Release of the Abbreviated AIB Report.
   11.7.1. The convening authority’s SJA shall review and the convening authority shall
   approve legally sufficient abbreviated AIB reports.
   11.7.2. The distribution scheme (para 10.6 and para 10.10 of this Instruction) of the
   approved AIB report may be modified to meet unique circumstances. At a minimum, the
   convening authority's MAJCOM/JA (if the AIB is not convened by the MAJCOM),
   AFLOA/JACC, and the mishap wing must receive a copy of the report.
   11.7.3. An abbreviated AIB report is releasable in its entirety. The convening authority’s
   SJA is the release authority for the approved report unless this authorization is withheld by
   the convening authority.
11.8. Disposition of Wreckage.
   11.8.1. The convening authority’s SJA may release wreckage from legal hold once the
   abbreviated AIB report has been approved.
   11.8.2. The convening authority’s SJA shall notify AFLOA/JACC in writing when releasing
   wreckage from legal hold.

  11.8.3. Only the convening authority or designee may approve the aircraft's repair and return
  to operational service prior to approval of the abbreviated AIB report.
  11.8.4. A release from legal hold is not a disposal authorization. Those in possession of the
  wreckage must further comply with T.O. 1-1-638 prior to disposal. In addition, ensure
  compliance with other applicable instructions, including AFMAN 23-110, Volume 6 prior to
  disposal.

                                           Chapter 12

                            INVESTIGATING SPACE MISHAPS

12.1. General Policy.
   12.1.1. The unique nature of the space industry forms the basis for Air Force policy
   authorizing the release of relevant space mishap evidence and equipment to commercial
   space users with a direct interest in the information, and to other federal space agencies, prior
   to the completion of the SIB and AIB processes, if such release will not hamper either
   process. The releases allow space launch contractors to make necessary changes and
   continue with scheduled launches, thus enabling rapid reuse of launch platforms and
   equipment. The commercial users are instructed to maintain the confidentiality of the
   information provided to them and to refrain from releasing it without specific Air Force
   authorization. See Attachment 2, Figure A2.20 of this Instruction.
   12.1.2. Space AIB investigations generally take considerably more time to complete due to
   the complex technical data that must be downloaded and analyzed and the classified and
   sensitive nature of the payloads and space launch vehicles.
       12.1.2.1. Due to classified nature of space assets, coordinate early with AFSPC/JA and
       AFLOA/JACC to obtain a waiver of the public release requirement and produce a
       classified report.
   12.1.3. Space SIB and AIB investigations may be conducted simultaneously and rely heavily
   on the receipt of the technical analyses conducted by the Engineering Analysis Group (EAG),
   discussed below, in arriving at their findings and conclusions.
   12.1.4. There are many unique aspects of a space accident investigation, including:
       12.1.4.1. Often, there is no mishap site; the only tie to the ground will be the launch or
       operations center.
       12.1.4.2. With on-orbit mishaps, there is usually no physical evidence, just telemetry
       data that can only be deciphered by those who built the craft.
       12.1.4.3. Space systems often do not have DoD maintenance personnel; contractors
       provide support for launch and on-orbit operations.
       12.1.4.4. Most military satellites are bought in limited quantities; after the last is
       launched, contractor support quickly dwindles as those who built the craft and have the
       most knowledge of it have moved on to other projects.
       12.1.4.5. Many space mishaps, particularly on-orbit, are classified.
12.2. The Engineering Analysis Group (EAG). The contractor and the system program office,
in coordination with the SIB and AIB presidents, may establish an EAG to assist in analyzing the
technical data from a mishap.
   12.2.1. The group is composed of contractor personnel (who sign confidentiality
   agreements), Air Force representatives, and other experts, as necessary. See Attachment 2,
   Figure A2.20 of this Instruction.
 80                                                    AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012


   12.2.2. The EAG is not required to identify causes or to make recommendations, but may do
   so.
   12.2.3. The EAG works with, but independently of, both the SIB and AIB. The EAG is not
   subject to the direction or supervision of either board.
      12.2.3.1. The AIB and SIB may ask questions of the EAG.
   12.2.4. The EAG may recommend to the SIB and AIB presidents that certain non-privileged
   evidence and equipment be released in order that space launches may continue.
      12.2.4.1. The AIB president, with the concurrence of the SIB president, shall release any
      such evidence or equipment unless doing so will hinder the SIB and AIB investigation
      processes.
   12.2.5. Under no circumstances will the EAG take any action that will hinder the work of the
   SIB or AIB. If at any time, the work of the EAG is thought to be hindering the ability of the
   AIB to meet its objectives, the AIB president shall notify AFSPC/JA immediately.
   12.2.6. The AIB is not required to adopt any findings or conclusions of the EAG.
12.3. The AIB should contact AFSPC/JA for specific guidance regarding the investigation
of space mishaps.
12.4. Assembling the Space AIB report.
   12.4.1. Assemble the AIB report in the same manner as other AIB reports, in accordance
   with Ch 8 of this Instruction. Include all the Tabs designated in para 8.10.5 of this
   Instruction. Mark unused Tabs as such but do not omit them or use them for other
   documentary evidence.
   12.4.2. Incorporate space-unique evidence in Tabs not otherwise designated in Ch 8 of this
   Instruction.
12.5. Information Collections, Records, and Forms
   12.5.1. Information Collections. No information collections are created by this publication.
   12.5.2. Records. The program records created as a result of the processes prescribed in this

Term Definitions
Accident— An unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage or injury
and meets Class A, B, C, or D mishap reporting criteria in accordance with DoDI 6055.07 and
AFI 91-204, Ch 1 and Attachment 1. Damage or injury includes: damage to DoD property;
occupational illness to DoD military or civilian personnel; injury to DoD military personnel on-
or off-duty; injury to on-duty DoD civilian personnel; damage to public or private property; or
injury or illness to non-DoD personnel caused by Air Force operations. Unless otherwise
AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012                                                                   87


indicated, the term ―accident‖ is used interchangeably with the term ―mishap‖ throughout this
Instruction.
Accident Investigation—A legal investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding an
accident that involves personal injury, death, and/or property damage. Accident investigations
conducted under this Instruction focus on Air Force accidents involving aircraft, UASs
(including unmanned aerial vehicles and aerostat balloons), missiles, and space systems or
equipment. AFI 51-507, Ground Accident Investigations, provides rules and procedures for
investigation of ground or afloat on-duty mishaps involving Air Force military members, civilian
employees, and/or structures, vehicles, systems, facilities, or other property. Air Force accident
investigations may be used to preserve evidence for use in litigation, adjudication of tort claims,
disciplinary actions, adverse administrative actions, and for other purposes.
Adverse Information— Information that constitutes: 1) a violation of criminal law; the
UCMJ; DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER); the Anti-Deficiency Act; DoD Directives
and Instructions; Air Force Instructions; or military or civilian personnel policies; 2) an abuse of
authority, especially when an element of personal benefit accrues to the official, a
family member, or an associate; 3) fraud, waste, and abuse or mismanagement, governed
by AFI 90—301 or involving non-appropriated funds or morale, welfare, and recreation assets,
including personnel and facilities, as governed by AFI 34-124, Air Force Morale, Welfare, and
Recreation Advisory Board (AFMWRAB) and AFI 34-202, Protecting Non-appropriated Funds
Assets; 4) misconduct by a medical provider requiring actions to suspend, limit, or revoke
clinical privileges, as governed by AFI 44-119, Medical Quality Operations; 5) prohibited
discrimination or sexual harassment as described by AFI 36-2706, Military Equal Opportunity
(MEO) Program and AFI 36-1201, Equal Employment Opportunity Complaints; 6) a matter not
included above which may reflect adversely on the individual’s judgment or exercise of
authority.
Adverse Personnel Action— Any proceeding or action taken that adversely affects or has a
potential to adversely affect the current position or career of a member of the Armed Forces.
Such actions include, but are not limited to, discharge, demotion, bar to reenlistment, court-
martial, nonjudicial punishment, Letter of Reprimand, or adverse performance evaluation.
Advisor— A functional area expert whose involvement with the board is limited to his/her area
of expertise. Typically, an advisor does not participate in board deliberations or witness
interviews. FAEs shall not be appointed on the convening order.
AIB— An accident investigation board is a group of individuals appointed to investigate and
prepare a report about an Air Force accident involving aircraft, UASs (including unmanned
aerial vehicles and aerostat balloons), missiles, or space systems or equipment that results in
personal injury, death, and/or property damage. At a minimum, the AIB shall include an AIB
president and AIB legal advisor.
AIB Members— All individuals appointed via the convening order to the AIB.
AIB President— Air Force military officer or civilian employee appointed to conduct an
accident investigation pursuant to this Instruction. The AIB president investigates and reports on
the facts and causes of an accident. Other AIB members and advisors may assist the AIB
president, but it is the AIB president’s responsibility to investigate the accident and prepare the
AIB report.
 88                                                     AFI51-503_AMCSUP_I 18 MAY 2012


AIB Report— Written product prepared by the AIB president to document the efforts of the
AIB during an accident investigation. The AIB report presents the AIB President’s findings
about how and why the accident happened. The report contains several parts: an Executive
Summary, Summary of Facts, Statement of Opinion, and supporting evidence (organized by
Tabs).
Air Reserve Component— The combined units, organizations, members, equipment, and other
property resources of the ANG and the AFRC when the units, organizations, and members are on
Title10 active duty. ANG and AFRC technicians are part of the Air Reserve Component.
Military status starts upon beginning duty for military pay or points and ends when duty stops.
Cause— A cause is an act, omission, condition, or circumstance that either starts or sustains a
mishap sequence. It may be an element of human or mechanical performance. A given act,
omission, condition, or circumstance is a "cause" if correcting, eliminating, or avoiding it would
have prevented the mishap.
Clear and Convincing Evidence— Evidence that enables the AIB president to make a
determination without serious or substantial doubt. In other words, evidence that shows that it is
highly probable that the conclusion is correct. This standard of proof applies to accident
investigations. It requires less certainty than the ―beyond a reasonable doubt‖ standard which
requires determinations be made based on almost absolute certainty, but more certainty than the
―preponderance of evidence‖ standard which only requires conclusions be supported by the
greater weight of credible evidence. The weight of evidence supporting a conclusion is not
determined by the sheer number of witnesses or the volume of documents presented, but rather
by the evidence which best accords with reason and probability.
Colonel (or civilian equivalent)— Any Regular Air Force active duty, USAFR or ANG officer
in the grade of O-6; or an officer who has been selected for promotion to the grade of O-6, but
has not yet assumed that grade; or an Air Force civil service employee in the grade of GS-15 or
National Security Personnel System (NSPS) Pay Band 3. For purposes of this Instruction, these
individuals will be referred to as colonels (or civilian equivalent).
Convening Authority— The individual responsible for conducting the legal (accident)
investigation of an on-duty accident involving Air Force aircraft, UASs (including unmanned
aerial vehicles and aerostat balloons), missiles, and space systems or equipment. The convening
authority initiates the accident investigation by convening an AIB and closes the investigation by
approving the AIB report prepared about the investigation.
Destroyed aircraft, UAS, missile, space launch system, or space asset— Aircraft, UAS
(including unmanned aerial vehicles and aerostat balloons), missile, space launch system, or
space asset will be considered destroyed when the man-hours required to repair the aircraft,
UAS, missile, space launch system, or space asset exceeds the maximum stated in the "major
repairman-hours" column of TO 1-1-638.
Direct Cost— Direct mishap costs ONLY include property damage costs (DoD and non-DoD)
and environmental cleanup costs. According to DoDI 6055.07, E4.12.2, calculate the direct cost
of an accident by adding all costs of damaged or destroyed assets, including resultant costs such
as environmental decontamination, property clean-up, and restoration. The direct cost of damage

DoD Accident— An unplanned event, or series of events, that results in damage to DoD
property, occupational illness to DoD military or civilian personnel, injury to DoD military or
civilian personnel while on-duty, injury to DoD military personnel while off-duty, damage to
public or private property, or injury or illness to non-DoD personnel caused by DoD operations.
DoD Component— The Department of Defense and all it parts and subordinate organizations,
to include all military departments, all military services, and all DoD agencies.
Engineering Analysis Group (EAG)— An independent group of contractor personnel, Air
Force representatives, and other experts established to assist the SIB and AIB in analyzing the
technical data from a space mishap investigation. The EAG may recommend to the SIB and AIB
presidents that certain non-privileged evidence and equipment be released while the
investigations are pending in order that space launches may continue.
Evidence— Information or data upon which a conclusion or judgment may be based. Evidence
is simply information that tends to prove or disprove the existence of a fact.
Executive Summary— A one-page statement of the basic facts surrounding the accident being
investigated and the AIB president’s opinion regarding the cause(s) and/or factor(s) that
substantially contributed to the mishap. The Executive Summary is a stand-alone document. It
must be complete and make sense without reference to any other document.
Factual Data Animation— An aircraft accident animation based on non-privileged factual data
(also known as a raw cut animation). AFSC technicians sometimes prepare an animation of the
mishap for the SIB; the raw cut of that animation which does not reflect any confidential witness
statements or of the deliberations or findings of the SIB, and thus may be used by the AIB.
Fatal Injury— Injuries resulting in death, either in the mishap or at a later time, to include
within 30 days subsequent to the medical discharge, retirement, or separation from the service,
due to complications arising from mishap injuries.
Foreign Country— Any land, water, or airspace that is subject to competent exercise of
jurisdiction by one or more foreign governments or international organizations; a nation,
territory, or geographic area that is outside the United States.

for investigation evidence, including wreckage, as directed. Upon release from legal hold, the
host installation disposes of evidence. The host installation normally has responsibility for initial
clean up of the accident site and any required follow-on environmental remediation or
restoration. In some circumstances, such as those where the mishap occurs in certain overseas
locations, host installation responsibilities may be assigned to an installation otherwise not
connected with the mishap to provide the required logistical and administrative support
necessary to conduct the investigation.
Incident Commander— A trained and experienced responder who provides on-scene tactical
control using subject matter experts (SME) and support from other functionals. Normally,
incident commanders are SMEs from the Fire, Medical, or Security Forces response elements.
The incident commander uses the Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) to manage
the incident. AFIMS is a methodology designed to incorporate the requirements of Homeland
Security Presidential Directive-5, the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and the
National Response Plan (NRP). AFIMS has replaced the term ―on scene commander‖ with
―incident commander‖ to be consistent with NIMS and NRP terminology. See AFI 10-2501, Air
Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations.
Installation— A base, camp, post, station, yard, center, or other activity under the jurisdiction of
the Secretary of one of the DoD’s military departments. An installation might be located in the

established pursuant to such agreement, or any other instrument defined as a binding
international agreement under DoD Directive 5530.3, International Agreements.
Joint Service Accident— A single mishap involving two or more military services of the DoD
in which one or more services experiences reportable injuries or damages.
Legal Investigation— An investigation of a DoD accident conducted for any purpose other than
accident prevention. A legal investigation inquires into the facts and circumstances surrounding
an accident, but does not focus on accident prevention. A legal investigation obtains and
preserves evidence for use in litigation, adjudication of tort claims, disciplinary actions, adverse
administrative actions, and all other purposes except accident prevention.
MAJCOM— Major Command. The term ―MAJCOM,‖ as used in this Instruction, means major

when fairly considered, produces the stronger impression and is more convincing as to its truth
when weighed against the opposing evidence.
Privileged Safety Information— Privileged safety information refers to information that is
exempt by statute or case law from disclosure outside the Air Force safety community. The
military safety privilege is judicially recognized and protects the military investigative process.
The Air Force treats privileged safety information as confidential information to ensure
commanders quickly obtain accurate mishap information thereby promoting safety, combat
readiness, and mission accomplishment. Privileged information includes:
1. Findings, conclusions, causes, recommendations, analysis, and the deliberative process of
safety investigators. Diagrams and exhibits if they contain information which depicts the
analysis of safety investigators. This includes draft versions of the above material.
