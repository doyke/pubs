                                            Chapter 1

                       GENERAL POLICY AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. General Policy.
     1.1.1. This instruction provides guidance for developing a local Airfield Driving Program
     (ADP) to provide safe ground vehicle operations and pedestrian control on USAF owned and
     operated airfields. It outlines training requirements for all personnel (e.g., military,
     Department of Defense, Civilian, Contractors, etc.) who, as part of their job, are required to
     drive unescorted on an airfield.
        1.1.2. Personnel required to drive on the airfield must be knowledgeable of and comply
        with the procedures outlined in this AFI and locally developed Airfield Driving
        Instruction (ADI). For the purpose of this AFI, the ADI is a wing or base level
        instruction.
        1.1.3. In today‘s complex airfield environment, there are incidents involving aircraft,
        pedestrians, and ground vehicles at USAF airfields that lead to property damage and
        personnel injury. One of the most hazardous incidents for an airfield driver to be
        involved with is a runway incursion. A runway incursion occurs when an aircraft,
        vehicle or person enters the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and
        take-off of aircraft without approval from Air Traffic Control Tower (TOWER). Runway
        incursions have the potential to result in aircraft endangerment and loss of life. While
        there are several factors involved in a runway incursion, the leading causes of these
        incidents result from a failure to follow procedures, inadequate vehicle operator training,
        and loss of situational awareness. Therefore, strict adherence to the procedures in this
        AFI is essential to preventing aircraft-vehicle mishaps and personnel injury on the
        airfield.
        1.1.4. Airfield Management (60 OSS/OSAA) is responsible for Travis AFB airfield
        driving program. Unit Airfield Driving Program Managers (ADPMs) are responsible for
        the individual unit training programs. Unit ADPMs ensure all airfield drivers are
        properly trained and certified. Only operators and vehicles designated by the wing
        commander or airfield management, as prescribed in AFMAN 24-306, Manual for
        Wheeled Vehicle Driver AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving and AFMAN 31-116, Air Force
        Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, will be given access to the airfield.
        1.1.5. The ADP is developed and managed in accordance with (IAW) AFI 13-213. The
        standards and directives on the following pages have been established for the control of
        all motor vehicles and airfield drivers on TAFB. This instruction is applicable to all
        personnel driving on any portion of TAFB airfield, to include, all locally assigned
        personnel (military and civilian), Department of Defense (DoD), private contractors,

      2.4.2.1. Review of this ADI.
      2.4.2.2. Completion of the Airfield Driving CBT.
      2.4.2.3. FAA Signs, Markings, and Lighting Slide Show.
      2.4.2.4. 25 question multiple choice test through the ADTP website.
      2.4.2.5. Review of new procedures or airfield configuration changes, as determined by
      the Wing ADPM and provided to all Unit ADPMs.
      2.4.2.6. Annual refresher requirements. Note: Specific vehicle drivers who infrequently
      operate vehicles in the CMA may be required to conduct refresher training twice a year,
      as determined by the Wing ADPM (will be notified in writing of requirement).
          2.4.2.6.1. Unit ADPM must maintain a copy of the most current refresher training
          completion dates on file in the unit, updated monthly.
          2.4.2.6.2. The annual refreshers training process is limited to 6 years. Due to the
          changing airfield environment, after 6 years of annual refreshers, the individual will
          complete the entire airfield driving certification process over.
          2.4.2.6.3. Annual refreshers training must be accomplished within the month of
          expiration. Failure to do so will result in the individual‘s airfield driving privileges
          being suspended. For reinstatement, the entire airfield driving certification process
          will need to be re-accomplished.
             2.4.2.6.3.1. Those members deploying for extended timelines or during their
             refresher due date, refresher training must be accomplished prior to deployment.
             If training is not done for this instance, the member will become overdue and will
             be in training status. The member would be required to initiate airfield driving
             training upon return. Note: Personnel that were not able to complete refresher
             training (e.g., deployed, TDY, etc.) must complete it prior to driving on the
             airfield.
             2.4.2.6.3.2. For AFRC members, refresher training is recommended to be
             completed the month prior to, or earlier than refresher due month. Due to these
             members only coming in certain days of the month, there is a high probability
             they may become overdue and either be dropped from the system or processed
             into trainee status. Note: All required airfield training and issuance of the AF
             Form 483 must be accomplished within 60 days. Airfield Management will not
             issue an AF Form 483 to personnel who have not met this time limit. The only
             approved site for this training is the ADTP website. After unit ADPM‘s
             validation of completing refresher training requirements, the driver is able to print
             the new license through the ADTP web site. Dispose of the previous license
             immediately to avoid confusion.
2.5. Testing Requirements.

     For those individuals that do not have ADTP access, see Attachment 23.
     2.5.1.2. General Knowledge Test. The unit Step 3 test is a general knowledge test with
     questions from all applicable test question databases (unit, wing, MAJCOM, or USAF).
     A Step 3 test‘s purpose is to gauge the member‘s knowledge level and help pinpoint
     deficient areas prior to taking the Step 4 wing test which is closed book. Unit ADPMs
     shall work with the wing ADPM in development of unit tests to ensure sufficient
     coverage of all knowledge areas. Individuals must achieve a minimum passing score of
     80%, (corrected to 100%). Utilize the ADTP website when available or use Attachment
     23.
        2.5.1.2.1. All Step 3 and Step 4 tests are contained in and administrated by the
        ADTP. Step 3 tests are enabled by the unit ADPM for their members. Step 4 tests, or
        wing test, (initially) will be enabled by the Wing ADPM. Subsequent tests (if
        member fails) will be enabled by the Unit ADPM. Note: All tests are enabled for 72
        hours and members have 1 hour to finish after test start.
        2.5.1.2.2. Each Step 4 test is comprised of a series of sections to make up a whole
        test. If a member fails any section of the Step 4 test, the ADTP will enable only those
        Step 4 test sections that the member previously failed.
     2.5.1.3. Communication Test. Test will cover basic communication principles, phonetic
     alphabet, standard aviation phraseology, escort phraseology/rules, and a simulation of
     radio communications between a vehicle operator and ATCT. For example, initial radio
     contact, crossing active runway, hold short instructions, etc. Individuals must achieve a
     minimum passing score of 100%. Utilize the ADTP website when available or use
     Attachment 23.
        2.5.1.3.1. Those authorized to transition/work in the CMA will obtain an additional
        restriction/stamp on their IMT Form 483 issued by 60 OSS/OSAA to indicate
        communication testing conducted. The restriction letter -V‖ stands for communication
        test.

  2.5.2. A minimum passing score of 80% (corrected to 100%) is required on the general
  knowledge test and a 100% on all airfield diagram, runway incursion prevention, and
  communication questions (i.e., Missing the hold line question on the written test will result in
  an automatic failure).
     2.5.2.1. The Airfield Diagram/Layout Test, Runway Incursion Prevention Test,
     Communication Test and General Knowledge Test are incorporated into one test that is
     given on the ADTP website.
     2.5.2.2. Contact 60 OSS/OSAA, Airfield Management, in the event you require access to
     a hardcopy test.
  2.5.3. Test Failures. Any score below 80% will require unit ADPMs to conduct additional
  training for those members that fail the wing test. Enable their next attempt at the unit test
  once remedial training is accomplished, but no sooner than seven calendar days.
  Subsequently, upon passing the unit retest, coordinate with the wing ADPM to enable
  retaking the wing test(s).
     2.5.3.1. A second failure requires a letter signed by their unit commander stating that the
     trainee has completed additional airfield drivers training and is safe to operate on the
     airfield. Trainees who fail a second time may retest no earlier than 14 calendar days from
     the failure date along with completion of additional training.
     2.5.3.2. Third time failures will not be granted airfield driving privileges.

                      OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

3.1. General.
   3.1.1. The following standards will be observed at all times when vehicles are operating on
   the airfield. Care, attention, and strict adherence to these procedures will prevent accidental
   damage to aircraft and injury to personnel. The Airfield Manager (AFM) is the designated
   authority for the interpretation of airfield driving standards and rules. It is expressly
   forbidden for any vehicle to use the airfield area as a shortcut to any point on or off the
   airfield that is accessible by roads outside the airfield environment. All airfield drivers are
   required to know the location and meaning of Controlled Movement Area (CMA) and their
   associated markings and signs, whether or not the driver will be operating in the CMA.
   3.1.2. Personnel driving on the airfield must complete airfield driver‘s training or be
   escorted by a vehicle driver possessing a valid AF Form 483 prior to entry to the airfield.
       3.1.2.1. An individual may act as an escort for two or more vehicles who are together on
       or within 250 feet of each other. The escort vehicle is responsible for the group and will
       relay Tower control instructions/communication for the group.
   3.1.3. Units sponsoring TDY personnel or Non-base assigned contractors are responsible for
   providing training or an escort that possesses a valid AF Form 483.
3.2. Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Operations.
   3.2.1. No vehicle operator or pedestrian may enter the CMA without specific approval from
   the Tower. Exception: Vehicles and/or pedestrians may be escorted into the CMA by
   another vehicle and/or pedestrian that have two-way radio contact with the Tower and been
   trained and possesses a valid AF Form 483.
   3.2.1.1. The CMA is comprised of both runways, the landing zone, overruns, 100 feet on
   either side of the runways. The CMA is 100 feet off the edge of south east side of the
   landing zone edge and the entire area between 21/03 LZ and Runway 21L/03R. The
   checkerboard area is part of the CMA and consists of the extended centerline area of Runway
   21R/03L that includes taxiways D, E, and F (Attachment 9). Note: The runway edge is
   defined as the physical edge of the pavement.
   3.2.2. No aircraft, vehicles or pedestrians may enter the CMA without specific approval from ATC.
   Note: Everyone must read back all ATC instructions verbatim. All vehicles will stop at the VFR hold
   line and request permission to enter the CMA. Note: Permission may not be requested or granted
   from any other source. A three-way relayed message to the control tower is prohibited.
   3.2.3. All aircraft, vehicles and pedestrians operating in the CMA will monitor and maintain two-way
   communication with the control tower. Note: Only the driver of the vehicle is authorized to talk to
   the control tower for access to the CMA. It is forbidden for any other person in the vehicle to request
   this access.
   3.2.4. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis will have a permanent radio mounted in the
   vehicle. A hand-held radio will be used as a backup or when communication is require outside the
   vehicle. Note: Conduct an operational test of the radio used to communicate with the ATC before
   entering the CMA.

        3.2.4.1. Any vehicle requiring operations within the CMA that is not capable of two-way radio
        contact with control tower must be escorted by a properly equipped vehicle. Note: Airfield
        Management will not provide escorts.
   3.2.5. Vehicle operators must use LED/rotating beacon lights and/or emergency flashers when
   driving in the CMA.
   3.2.6. Vehicles and pedestrians operating in the CMA must use a distinct call sign (e.g., Airfield 1,
   Chief 1, Sweeper 1, Ops 1, TA 1, etc.) approved by Airfield Management, 60 OSS/OSAA, to ensure
   no duplication.

drive on the airfield within the CMA and communicate with the control tower on a regular basis. It does not
include operators who occasionally communicate with tower .
TRAVISAFBI13-213 5 NOVEMBER 2014                                                                27


   3.2.7. Vehicles/personnel authorized to operate in the CMA will continuously observe the
   control tower for light gun signals in the event radio contact is lost. If the tower controller
   flashes the white runway edge lights on and off or signals with a flashing red light gun signal,
   exit the runway immediately. Note: AFVA 11-240, 13-222 and Airfield diagram are
   mandatory items for airfield vehicles. Note: These decals may be permanently affixed in
   plain view of the driver or clipped to the inside of the sun visor on the driver‘s side of the
   vehicle so it can be flipped down for reference. The AFVA(s) serve as a quick reference
   guide to identify airport signs and markings. AFVA can be obtained at Airfield
   Management, electronically on the 60 OSS/OSAA SharePoint page, and on the e-Publishing
   website at: www.e-publishing.af.mil for downloading or ordering.
   3.2.8. Vehicles/personnel must always acknowledge communications with the tower
   controller by reading back all information so the tower controller knows the message was
   received and understood.
      3.2.8.1. The words "clear" or ―clearance‖ must not be used by personnel or vehicle
      operators in the CMA or in communication with ATC. Exception: Vehicle operators
      may reply ―Loud and Clear‖ in response to an ATC request for radio transmission
      quality or clarity.
   3.2.9. The vehicle operator must always give aircraft and tower controller transmission
   priority unless an emergency exists.
   3.2.10. Immediately report improper radio terminology to Airfield Management (60
   OSS/OSAA).
   3.2.11. Vehicles operating in the CMA must use high beams, rotating beacon lights and/or
   emergency flashers.
   3.2.12. Vehicles crossing the runway will be limited to vehicle operators/traffic performing
   mission essential duties and then only to an absolute minimum. Note: When crossing a
   runway is required during flying operations, the preferred crossing point is the departure end.
3.3. Airfield Access Points/Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Checks.
   3.3.1. Access points to the airfield are: Building P-1 parking lot, Base Operations/Tower
   parking lot, Maintenance and AGE Parking lots, Hangar row and APS Warehouse area.
   Refer to Attachment 7.
   3.3.2. FOD checks are not required unless you leave the paved surface.
      3.3.2.1. At a minimum, if a FOD check is needed, it will consist of the following:
          3.3.2.1.1. Inspection of vehicle tires. Remove foreign materials (e.g.; rocks, gravel,
          etc.) as applicable.
          3.3.2.1.2. A visual check to ensure all external vehicle components is secured.
          Secure any/all items loaded on payload vehicle, including all tie down device loose
          ends such as chains, ropes, packaging or other item that may become dislodged
          during movement while on the airfield.
          3.3.2.1.3. A thorough walk around of the vehicle to check for damaged, loose, or
          worn parts.

   3.3.3. Driving off paved surfaces is prohibited, except in an emergency situation or if duty-
   related. The driver of a vehicle entering a paved surface from an unpaved surface shall check
   the vehicle tires for FOD before proceeding onto the paved surface. Any FOD removed from
   tires will be kept inside the vehicle or placed in the FOD container until it can be disposed of
   off the airfield area.
   3.3.4. Vehicle operators, when performing FOD checks on vehicle tires and the driver‘s seat
   is vacant, turn off the ignition, and close the door to perform the FOD check on the tires.
      3.3.4.1. AGE-towing vehicles may be placed in neutral and left running while the
      operator completes hookup and delivery operations IAW AFMAN 24-306. This
      facilitates movement of the vehicle by hand to align pintle and tongue during hookup
      operation and move the vehicle upon detaching the tow tongue from the pintle hook
      during delivery operations of heavy pieces of AGE. This also reduces wear of the tow
      vehicle starter. Operators must shut off vehicle, set the parking brake, and place the
      vehicle in park or reverse if they do not drive off with the AGE equipment following
      hookup or delivery.
   3.3.5. Emergency response vehicles responding to an emergency or alert condition are
   exempt from FOD checks.
3.4. Vehicle Parking and Operations near Aircraft.
   3.4.1. Vehicles will not be backed or parked in the immediate vicinity (25 feet in front, 200
   feet to rear) of any aircraft, except as authorized for operations such as loading, unloading,
   servicing or towing. A spotter will be posted when a vehicle is backed towards an aircraft.
   Pre-positioned wheel chocks will be used to prevent vehicles from being backed into aircraft.
   3.4.2. All unattended vehicles will be parked so they do not interfere with the aircraft being
   towed or taxied. The parking brake on all parked vehicles will be set. Ignition will be turned
   off, keys will be left in the ignition and the gear lever put in reverse for vehicles with manual
   transmissions or in the ―park‖ position for vehicles with automatic transmissions. Vehicles
   with a parking brake will have it engaged and vehicles without a parking brake system will
   have wheel chocks placed in front of and behind one of the rear wheels. For tandem wheel
   vehicles place a chock between the dual tandem axle. IAW TO 00-25-172, fuel, oil, and
   water servicing vehicles must be chocked when the driver‘s seat is vacated. The only
   vehicles exempt from these requirements are emergency vehicles responding to an
   emergency. No vehicle will be left unattended within 200 feet of the taxiway centerline.
   3.4.3. Park so that the direction of travel, either forward or backward, will not be toward any
   part of the aircraft.
   3.4.4. The driver‘s side of the vehicle will be on the aircraft side.
   3.4.5. All wheeled AGE and maintenance equipment will have the brake engaged. If not
   equipped with brakes then the equipment will be chocked.
   3.4.6. When aircraft engines are about to start or in operation, no vehicle will be parked or
   driven closer than 25 feet in front of or 200 feet to the rear of any aircraft (300 feet to the rear
   of C-5 and B-747). Vehicles parked at the side of an aircraft will be located clear of the
   wingtips plus 30 feet and be clearly visible to personnel in the aircraft cockpit.
TRAVISAFBI13-213 5 NOVEMBER 2014                                                             29


   3.4.7. NEVER drive a vehicle under any part of an aircraft unless, in the performance of
   your job. Such activities are authorized by applicable technical orders and governing
   regulation
   3.4.8. No unattended vehicle will park in front of hangar doors. This area must be kept clear
   for aircraft towing operations and a minimum 25‘ wing-tip clearance must be maintained.
3.5. Speed Limits.
   3.5.1. No vehicle will be operated at a speed in excess of that deemed reasonable and
   prudent for existing traffic and weather conditions.
   3.5.2. Under no circumstance is speeding permitted. Only exception is emergency vehicles
   (See paragraph 3.5.3.6).
   3.5.3. Airfield speed limits:
      3.5.3.1. Aircraft Parking Ramps - 15 MPH maximum for general purpose vehicles.
      Note: Within 25 feet of an aircraft speed limit is 5 MPH.
      3.5.3.2. Taxiways - 15 MPH unless otherwise posted.

      are classified as tugs, forklifts, refueling vehicles, K-loaders, bobtails, etc.
      3.5.3.6. Emergency response vehicles may exceed 10 MPH above their speed limit when
      responding to an emergency/alert and with rotating beacon lights and/or emergency
      flashers. However; emergency/alert vehicles will not assume the right of way and must
      use the utmost safety and caution when responding.
      3.5.3.7. Follow-me vehicles may be operated in excess of 15 MPH only to accommodate
      the optimum safe taxiing speed of aircraft and when safety is not compromised. Note:
      Tugs will not be used as follow-me vehicles at any time.
      3.5.3.8. Runway speed limit – vehicle speed as required but shall be reasonable and
      prudent for the conditions.
      3.5.3.9. Aircraft towing speed is 5 MPH.
      3.5.3.10. Support equipment will be towed in accordance with visible decals as marked
      on unit. Max tow speed is stenciled or posted on the units tow bar or frame assembly.

3.6. Towing Operations.
   3.6.1. AGE towing vehicles may be placed in neutral and left running while the driver
   completes hook-up operations. This facilitates movement of the AGE towing vehicle by
   hand to align the pintle hook. Drivers must set the parking brake, place the vehicle in park or
   reverse and shut off the vehicle if the AGE equipment is not to be towed immediately
   following hook-up.
   3.6.2. Do not use ropes, chains, cables or other flexible means to tow ground servicing
   equipment.
   3.6.3. Safety or cotter pins will be used to secure pintle hooks and trailer hitches.
   3.6.4. No more than four, type B1, B4, B5 and similar small stands may be towed as follows:
   two sets of two in tandem on a double hitch or two in tandem on a single hitch. Type B3, J7,
   and similar large stands will be towed singly on a center mounted hitch. Four-wheeled units
   will not be towed behind two-wheeled units. Large pieces of AGE, when towed in tandem,
   will not block the driver‘s vision of the last item being towed.
3.7. Airfield Emergencies.
   3.7.1. Ground vehicles not in direct support of the emergency will remain clear of runways,
   taxiways and airfield access points until the emergency is terminated.
       3.7.1.1. Initial runway IFE/GE responders will be limited to Fire Department,
       Ambulance, and Airfield Management personnel. Security Forces and Crash Recovery
       will be considered secondary responders and will hold short of the CMA unless otherwise
       requested by the responding Fire Chief or incident/on-scene commander.
       3.7.1.2. All emergency response vehicles must have approval from the Tower or
       authorized vehicle escort, to enter the CMA.
   3.7.2. Vehicles responding to an emergency on the runway must NEVER assume they have
   blanket permission to enter the runway after an emergency aircraft lands. All vehicles
   MUST call tower and receive permission to enter the runway PRIOR to accessing it.
   3.7.3. During emergency conditions, the control tower will advise aircraft to hold their
   positions so they will not interfere with responding emergency vehicles. At the tower‘s
   discretion, aircraft may be moved to a more suitable parking spot or holding area that is clear
   of ground vehicles.
3.8. Reduced Visibility.
   3.8.1. When visibility is less than 300 feet, refueling and explosive-loaded vehicles will not
   operate on the airfield unless directed by the wing commander.
   3.8.2. When visibility is less than 100 feet, airfield vehicles (except emergency response)
   will not operate on the airfield. Flashing/hazard lights will be utilized on all vehicles
   operating on the airfield.
   3.8.3. When visibility is less than 50 feet, walking guides equipped with a flashing or
   luminescent wand will be used during emergency movement of alert vehicles. Alert vehicles
   will utilize flasher/hazard lights.

   means will be used to alert taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. As a minimum, the ground vehicle
   operator will:
       3.12.1.1. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers ON.
       3.12.1.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission:
       ―All parties BREAK, BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield
       Management, Tower and Maintenance Operations Center.‖ State the nature of the
       problem and report your position on the airfield.
   3.12.2. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (Security Forces, Civil Engineering,
   transportation, etc.) shall make every effort to assist getting the disabled vehicle off the
   airfield, especially if the vehicle is located on the parking aprons, taxiways or runway.
   3.12.3. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the vehicle and continue
   attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft or other vehicles in the vicinity.
   3.12.4. In the event of a disabled vehicle in the CMA, the vehicle operator will immediately
   notify control tower and airfield management by any means possible to coordinate
   expeditious removal of the disabled vehicle from the CMA.
       3.12.4.1. The vehicle operator will ensure the disabled vehicle is not left unattended in
       the CMA.
       3.12.4.2. The disable vehicle will be removed using any method in the quickest and
       safest way possible.
   3.12.5. In the event vehicle/Tower radio failure Tower will flash the runway edge lights on
   and off to alert vehicle operators/pedestrians on the runway that there is a problem and/or
   emergency that requires them to immediately exit the runway.
   3.12.6. All vehicle operators/pedestrians must exit the runway immediately. Contact Tower
   or AMOPS immediately and advise off the runway and include any pertinent information
   that might affect safe runway operations. If not able to communicate with Tower or AMOPS

   shoulders unless specifically checking the pavement condition or checking for FOD. The
   only vehicles that drive on the centerline are Airfield Management vehicles, follow-me
   vehicles and the airfield sweeper.
   3.13.3. Ground vehicle operators will drive on the right side of the taxiway/taxi lane
   centerline in reference to the vehicle‘s direction of travel. Ground vehicle operators will give
   way to emergency vehicles by pulling to the far right of the taxiway/taxi lane. Some vehicles
   (i.e.; K- loaders, tow vehicles, maintenance tow vehicles, etc.), may not be able to drive on
 34                                                 TRAVISAFBI13-213 5 NOVEMBER 2014


   the far right side due to vehicle widths and blind spots. Do not park vehicles on taxiways or
   leave vehicles unattended within 200 feet of the taxiway centerline.
   3.13.4. Except for Follow-Me vehicles, vehicles will not be parked in front of or driven into
   the path of taxiing aircraft. Note: Vehicles will not be driven between a taxiing aircraft and
   its Follow-Me vehicle.
   3.13.5. During hours of darkness, headlights of a vehicle shining towards a moving aircraft
   will be turned OFF immediately so the pilot‘s night vision is not affected and the vehicle
   parking lights or emergency flashers will be turned on so its position is known. Headlights
   will remain OFF until the aircraft is out of range and turned back on prior to putting the
   vehicle in motion. Vehicle operators with daytime running light-equipped vehicles (DRLs)
   must know the operating procedures for their vehicles (consult the owner‘s manual). The
   following procedures shall work for most DRL-equipped vehicles: stop the vehicle, shift
   transmission into park and apply the parking brake.
3.14. Right of Way.
   3.14.1. All vehicle drivers who operate on the taxiways or parking ramps/aprons will give
   way to taxiing and towed aircraft. The responsibility to avoid aircraft rests with the ground
   vehicle operators. Vehicle operators encountering an aircraft will exit the taxiway by the
   shortest route and, if necessary, reverse course to quickly move out of the aircraft‘s way. As
   a last resort, vehicle will not leave any hard surfaces. This is to ensure adequate wingtip
   clearance for the aircraft.
   3.14.2. Ground vehicle operators will yield the right-of-way to all aircraft and:
       3.14.2.1. Will not cross a taxiing aircraft or cross in front of an approaching aircraft that

  RADIO COMMUNICATIONS PHRASEOLOGY, DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUES

7.1. General.
   7.1.1. Radio communications are a critical link in the ATC system. The single, most
   important thought in communications with the TOWER is understanding. It is essential to
   acknowledge each radio communication with controllers by using the appropriate call sign.
   7.1.2. Brevity is important, therefore, radio transmissions must be kept as brief as possible.
   However, controllers must know what you want to do before they can properly carry out their
   control duties. Conversely, the vehicle operator must know exactly what the controller wants
   them to do.
   7.1.3. Vehicle operators must maintain vigilance in monitoring air traffic control radio
   communications frequencies for situational awareness, especially when operating on an
   active runway.
7.2. Radio Techniques.
   7.2.1. Listen before transmitting. If someone else is talking, the keying of another
   transmitter will be ineffective and will probably override/block out the other receiver causing
   the other vehicle operator to repeat his or her call.
   7.2.2. Think before keying the transmitter. You must know exactly what you need to say
   before you say it.
   7.2.3. The microphone will be very close to your lips and, after pressing the ―microphone
   button, a slight pause may be necessary to ensure, the first word is transmitted clearly. Speak
   in a normal, conversational tone.
   7.2.4. When releasing the microphone button, wait a few seconds before calling again. The
   controller may be looking for you on the airfield, transmitting on a different frequency, or
   scanning the runway to enable your request.
   7.2.5. Be alert to the sounds or the lack of sounds in the receiver. Check your volume,
   recheck your frequency, and make sure that your microphone is not stuck in the transmit
   position. Frequency blockage can, and has, occurred for extended periods due to
   unintentional transmitter operation. This type of interference is commonly referred to as a
   -stuck mike,‖ and controllers may refer to it in this manner when attempting to correct the
   problem.
   7.2.6. Be sure that you are within the performance range of your radio equipment and the
   ground station equipment. Refer to the airfield diagram to determine possible radio blind
   spots.
   7.2.7. Use caution when using a vehicle mounted/handheld radio and operating a vehicle at
   the same time. When possible, only use the radio when the vehicle is safely parked.
7.3. Phraseology.
   7.3.1. Vehicle operators must contact the TOWER controller each and every time they
   proceed onto or leave the CMA. When proceeding onto a CMA, vehicle operators must
 48                                                TRAVISAFBI13-213 5 NOVEMBER 2014


   advise the controller of three things: WHO you are, WHERE you are, and WHAT your
   intentions are. Vehicle operators must always acknowledge all communications so ground
   control and other persons know that the message was received. Vehicle operators must
   always give aircraft and ground control transmissions priority unless an emergency exists.
   VHF/UHF transmissions are reserved for the primary use of aircraft and TOWER personnel.
   7.3.2. A typical runway crossing transmission sequence is as follows:

   7.3.3. Always read back instructions verbatim before taking any action and allow time for
   correction, if misinterpreted. If you are unsure what the controller has transmitted, or if you
   do not understand an instruction, you MUST ask the controller to repeat it. Good
   communications only occur when each party knows and understands what the other is saying.

CMA.
Hot Spot— A runway safety related problem area or intersection on an airfield. Typically, it is a
complex or confusing taxiway/taxiway or taxiway/runway intersection. A confusing condition
may be compounded by a miscommunication between a controller and a pilot, and may cause an
aircraft separation standard to be compromised. The area may have a history of surface incidents
or the potential for surface incidents.
Immediately— Used by ATC when such action compliance is required to avoid an imminent
situation.
Instrument Hold line— A designated boundary intended to protect the runway environment.
Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Instrument hold line is marked in
retro-reflective yellow paint.
