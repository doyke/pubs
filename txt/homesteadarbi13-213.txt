This instruction implements Air Force Instruction (AFI) 13-213, Airfield Driving; it also
implements/augments AFI 13-204 Volume 2, Airfield Operations Standardization and
Evaluations, AFI 13-204 Volume 3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, AFI 31-204,
Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, Air Force Joint Manual (AFMAN) 24-306, Manual
for the Wheeled Vehicle Driver, Chapter 20; AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational
Safety Instruction, Chapter 24; and 482 FWI 21-101, Foreign Object Damage (FOD) and
Dropped Object Program (DOP). This Homestead Air Reserve Base Instruction (HARBI)
establishes policies and procedures for control of vehicle operations on HARB’s airfield.
Vehicles are required on the airfield to support operations and maintenance. Although
Government Owned Vehicles (GOV) provide the vast majority of required vehicle support,
certain rare situations require augmentation by Privately Owned Vehicles (POV). Vehicular
traffic significantly amplifies the potential for collisions, injury, Foreign Object Debris (FOD) to
aircraft, and security incidents. Positive control of vehicles and vehicle operators is imperative.
It applies to all personnel who must operate GOVs or POVs on the airfield. Refer recommended
changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR)
using Air Force Form 847 (AF Form 847), Recommendation for Change of Publication; route
AF Form 847 from the field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records and disposed of

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Review with
AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving, for many procedures that have been changed. This instruction has
been renumbered to match the parent instruction and includes: Information on new procedures
and forms for training documentation, unit inspections, and reporting procedures; new Airfield
Driving Instruction (ADI) Compliance Spot Checks; reporting runway incursions; vehicle
operations in close proximity to aircraft and the “Circle of Safety”; and new tests for runway
incursion prevention, communications, and airfield layout. Hyperlinks have been added for
access certain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) publications.

              AIRFIELD OPERATING PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS

3.1. General. Personnel driving on the airfield will comply with the procedures described in
this instruction, AFI 13-213, AFMAN 24-306 Chapter 20, AFI 21-101, AFI 24-301, AFI 31-204,
and AFI 91-203 Chapter 24.
   3.1.1. As outlined in this instruction, personnel required to drive on the airfield for mission
   related duties will receive training or a briefing from the sponsoring/host unit (for TDY
   personnel or short-term contractors only) prior to entry on the airfield, or be escorted. All
   escorts must be trained and certified to drive on the airfield at HARB.
       3.1.1.1. IAW AFI 13-204 Vol 3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, and AFI
       31-102, Physical Security, AM personnel are not authorized to provide escorts. The
       sponsoring/host unit must provide escorts for personnel who are not qualified to drive on
       the airfield.
       3.1.1.2. Vehicles Authorized On the Airfield:
          3.1.1.2.1. Applicability. Any vehicle operating on the airfield must have a direct
          mission-related purpose. The airfield will not be used for convenience or as a
          shortcut to move from one part of the base to another. The use of perimeter and
          access roads will be used to the maximum extent.
          3.1.1.2.2. Government Vehicles. All mission-support GOVs, General Service
          Administration (GSA) vehicles, and special purpose vehicles are authorized on the
          airfield. These are easily recognizable and are not required to display any special
          identification.
          3.1.1.2.3. Non-Government Vehicles:
              3.1.1.2.3.1. Construction Contractors. Contractor vehicles working construction
              or repair projects on the airfield will be authorized access only by AFM or
              designated representative. AM will ensure contractors are briefed on control and
              safety requirements and acceptable routing at pre-construction meetings. POV
              passes (if issued) will be turned in at the end of the project(s). All construction
              personnel that will be driving during construction on the airfield must be trained
              by AM and be issued a temporary AF Form 483 to drive on any portion of the
              airfield.
              3.1.1.2.3.2. Privately Owned Vehicles. POVs on the airfield are discouraged for
              reasons of security, safety, FOD, and liability. Therefore, POV operations will be
              kept to the absolute minimum necessary to accomplish the mission. POV access
              to the airfield requires a POV Pass issued by Airfield Management.
                  3.1.1.2.3.2.1. Commanders and Key Personnel. Group and unit commanders
                  will certify by letter to Airfield Management that they have a valid need to
                  respond to the airfield in their POV for mission related reasons. A pass is
                  issued to an individual and is to be used for that individual’s specific vehicle
                  and license plate number. The pass is non-transferrable to any other
HOMESTEADARBI13-213 7 MAY 2014                                                                 19


                 individual or vehicle, and will be returned when the individual no longer
                 requires airfield access with the POV. This pass is valid for one calendar
                 year.
                 3.1.1.2.3.2.2. Contractor Vehicles. Contractor vehicles may be operated on

HOMESTEADARBI13-213 7 MAY 2014                                                                   21


   via FM radio Ramp Net (call sign “Airfield Ops”), via landline (ext.7156 or 7071), or relay
   via Tower.
3.3. Ramps:
   3.3.1. Vehicles entering any aircraft parking ramp shall adhere to established speed limits as
   published in this ADI, and shall adhere to any restrictions for operations in restricted areas,
   within close proximity to aircraft, or within the Circle of Safety.
3.4. Taxiways:
   3.4.1. Except as noted below, vehicle operators will drive on the far right-hand side of the
   taxiway in reference to the vehicle's direction of travel.
      3.4.1.1. Emergency response vehicles may travel on the near right-hand side, but must
      observe caution and safety.
      3.4.1.2. Vehicle operators may drive astride the taxiway centerline only when:
          3.4.1.2.1. Specifically checking the pavement condition,
          3.4.1.2.2. Checking for FOD,
          3.4.1.2.3. Leading a taxiing aircraft to parking, or
          3.4.1.2.4. Towing an aircraft.
          3.4.1.2.5. Normally, the only agencies/vehicles that will drive on the taxiway
          centerline are AM, Transient Alert (TA) Follow-Me, aircraft tugs (while towing an
          aircraft only), 93 FS Supervisor of Flying (SOF), and the airfield sweeper.
   3.4.2. Except for Follow-Me vehicles, no vehicle will be parked in front of or driven into the
   path of taxiing aircraft.
      3.4.2.1. No vehicle will be driven between a taxiing aircraft and its Follow-Me guide.
   3.4.3. During hours of darkness (sunset to sunrise), vehicle headlights shining towards a
   moving aircraft will be immediately turned off so the pilot’s night vision is not affected.
   Parking lights or emergency flashers will be turned on for visibility. Headlights will remain
   off until the aircraft is out of range, then will be turned back on before putting the vehicle in
   motion.
   3.4.4. All vehicle drivers who operate on parking ramps/aprons and taxiways will give way
   to taxiing and towed aircraft. The responsibility to avoid aircraft rests with ground vehicle
   operators. Vehicle operators encountering an aircraft (whether in front or behind) will exit
   the taxiway by the shortest route (and, if necessary, reverse course) in order to quickly move
   out of the way. Only as a last resort should the vehicle be driven off of paved surfaces to
   ensure adequate wingtip clearance for the aircraft. Adequate wingtip clearance is a minimum
   of 25 feet.
   3.4.5. Ground vehicle operators will yield the right-of-way to all aircraft and shall:
      3.4.5.1. Not cross in front of or behind any taxiing aircraft that is within 200 feet from
      their vehicle’s position.
      3.4.5.2. Remain at least 100 feet away from any helicopter with its rotors in motion.

       3.4.5.3. Yield right-of-way to emergency vehicles with rotating lights and sirens
       operating.
       3.4.5.4. Yield the right-of-way to any vehicle already operating on a taxiway they wish
       to enter or cross.
   3.4.6. Whenever a vehicle on the airfield experiences a malfunction that prevents operation
   under its own power, every means will be used to alert taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. As a
   minimum, the ground vehicle operator will:
       3.4.6.1. Leave the parking lights or emergency flashers on if the malfunction occurs
       within the CMA or during hours of darkness.
       3.4.6.2. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission on
       land mobile radio (LMR) Channel 15: “All parties break-break: This is (call sign) with
       an emergency for Airfield Management, Tower, and Maintenance: Disabled (vehicle
       type) located at (location), (nature of problem), (other info as required)”.
       3.4.6.3. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (Security Forces, Civil Engineering,
       Transportation, Transient Alert, etc.) should make every effort to assist in removing the
       disabled vehicle from the airfield—especially the parking aprons, taxiways, and runway.
       3.4.6.4. If the disabled vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, remain with the
       vehicle and continue trying to alert any taxiing aircraft or vehicles in the vicinity.
       3.4.6.5. If disabled vehicle is in the CMA, vehicle operator will:
          3.4.6.5.1. Notify Tower and AM by any means possible to coordinate expeditious
          removal of the disabled vehicle.
          3.4.6.5.2. Never leave a vehicle unattended in the CMA.
3.5. Vehicle Escorts:
   3.5.1. Escorts must be trained and certified airfield drivers with a valid AF Form 483.
   3.5.2. Escorts shall remain in control of and in close proximity to escorted vehicle(s) at all
   times.
   3.5.3. Escorts must never leave uncertified vehicle operators unattended while operating
   within the confines of the airfield environment.
   3.5.4. Escorts are responsible for making all radio calls to the control tower for permission to
   operate in or across the CMA.
3.6. Perimeter Road:
   3.6.1. Only certified vehicle drivers who hold a valid AF Form 483 are permitted to travel on
   the airfield perimeter roads. Otherwise, they must be escorted by a fully-qualified airfield
   driver.
   3.6.2. POV operators shall be granted access to the perimeter roads only if they carry a valid
   POV pass. This pass will be issued by Airfield Management to individuals that hold a valid
   AF Form 483 and a justification letter from their units’ commanders requiring them to drive
   their vehicle on the perimeter road in support of their mission.
HOMESTEADARBI13-213 7 MAY 2014                                                                 23


3.7. Operating In or Across the Controlled Movement Area (CMA): Any vehicle operating
in the CMA must have a valid AF Form 483, stamped for Airfield Driving on HARB and
annotated as authorized for CMA access. Furthermore, only vehicles possessing direct two-way
radio contact with the Control Tower are permitted in the CMA. Vehicle operators must obtain
permission from the Control Tower prior to entering or crossing the CMA.
   3.7.1. If radio contact is lost or suspected lost while operating in the CMA, operators will
   monitor the Tower for light gun signals while immediately exiting the CMA. Repeated
   flashing (or changes in intensity) of runway lights signifies a need from the Tower to
   communicate with the driver either by radio or light gun signal, and is an indication to
   immediately exit the runway. If radio failure is known or suspected, proceed to AMOPS and
   brief them on the incident.
   3.7.2. To enter or cross the CMA, the following procedures will be followed:
       3.7.2.1. Contact the Control Tower and receive permission. Upon receiving permission,
       repeat Tower’s instructions verbatim before proceeding. (See Attachment 2 of this ADI
       for additional guidance and proper phraseology.)
       3.7.2.2. If equipped, top-mounted rotating emergency lights/flashers must be in operation
       while in the CMA. Vehicles not equipped with top-mounted emergency lights may use
       dash or grill mounted lighting. As a minimum, the hazard lights/emergency flashers will
       be turned on.
       3.7.2.3. Vehicle operators in the CMA must constantly monitor their two-way radio for
       instructions from Tower.
       3.7.2.4. When finished operating in the CMA, contact Tower and report off. Ensure
       Tower acknowledges all reporting statements on or off the airfield.
          3.7.2.4.1. Personnel requiring access to the CMA that do not have two-way radio
          contact with Tower must be escorted. (See paragraph 3.5.)
          3.7.2.4.2. The Control Tower is the only agency authorized to permit vehicle
          operations in the CMA. Permission may not be requested of or granted by any other
          agency. Three-way relayed messages to the tower are prohibited.
3.8. Airfield Emergencies:
   3.8.1. Vehicle operators will yield right-of-way to all responding emergency vehicles.
   3.8.2. Ground vehicles operators not in direct support of the emergency will remain clear of
   taxiways, the runway, and airfield access points until the emergency is terminated.
   3.8.3. During emergency conditions, the Control Tower will advise aircraft to hold their
   position so they won’t interfere with responding emergency vehicles. At Tower's discretion,
   aircraft may be taxied to a more suitable parking place or holding area that is clear of ground
   vehicles.
3.9. Control Tower Light Gun Signals: All GOVs and POVs operating on the airfield must
have AFVA 11-240, USAF Signs and Signals in the vehicle, in sight of the driver. To obtain

   approach to the aircraft. Never drive vehicles under any part of the aircraft. Do not back or
   drive vehicles forward directly toward any aircraft (except as authorized in certain loading,
   unloading, or fueling operations). In these cases, place pre-positioned wheel chocks between
   the aircraft and the approaching vehicle to keep vehicles from striking the aircraft. Post
   guides as a required safety measure. Keep chocks in position until vehicles leave from within
   the ten-foot safety distance requirement.
      3.10.1.1. Never drive a vehicle under any part of an aircraft, especially the wings.
   3.10.2. “Close Proximity”: Vehicles will not be backed or parked in close proximity
   (within 25 feet) of any aircraft, except as authorized for operations such as loading or
   unloading, servicing, or towing. A spotter will be posted when a vehicle is backed towards an
   aircraft. Pre-positioned wheel chocks will be used to prevent vehicles from being backed into
   aircraft.
      3.10.2.1. When an aircraft’s engines are operating or are about to be started, no vehicle
      will be parked or driven closer than 25 feet in front of or 200 feet to the rear of that
      aircraft.
   3.10.3. Vehicles parked at the side of an aircraft will be located clear of the wingtips and
   shall be clearly visible to personnel in the aircraft cockpit.
   3.10.4. Maintenance vehicles, such as navigational aid maintenance, contractors, mowers,
   etc., operating near obstacles on the airfield such as taxiway/runway guidance signs,
   instrument landing system equipment, approach lights, etc. will use extreme caution. Should
   it become necessary to back a vehicle toward such obstructions, a spotter shall be used to
   avoid damage to the vehicle or costly equipment.
   3.10.5. Vehicles parked and left unattended on the flight line. Refer to AFI 91-203 Chapter
   24.

Terms
AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency—Issued by Airfield Management and stamped for
Airfield Driving at HARB once all airfield driving training requirements are successfully
completed.
Airfield—An area prepared for the accommodation (including any buildings, installations, and
equipment) of landing and take-off of aircraft. Includes the runway, all taxiways, taxi lanes,
ramps and aprons, hot cargo pad, arm/de-arm areas, hangars, and perimeter roads. Also known
as “airport operations area” (AOA) and “aerodrome”.
Airfield Management (AM)—Directs services in the AMOPS facility. Monitors/coordinates
airfield activities to provide a safe airfield environment. Ensures airfield is managed IAW AF
and FAA directives.
Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS)—Airfield facility which provides aircrews with
various services including flight planning/processing and weather. Previously known as “Base
Operations”.
Airfield Manager (AFM)—Manages AM facilities to ensure safe, efficient, and effective
support to the base flying mission and transient aircrews.
HOMESTEADARBI13-213 7 MAY 2014                                                                  35


Airfield Operations Manager (AOM)—Responsible for the overall operation/services provided
by the airfield operations flight in support of the wing flying mission and in compliance with
USAF and FAA guidelines.
Assistant Airfield Manager (AAFM)—The AAFM assists the AFM in supervising airfield
operations and airfield maintenance activities. Also serves as the Wing ADPM.
Circle of Safety—An imaginary circle measuring 10 feet out from (and connecting) the nose,
wingtips, and tail of an aircraft. Vehicles are not allowed inside this circle unless they are to
service the aircraft or be loaded aboard.
Controlled Movement Area (CMA)—All airfield surfaces (paved or unpaved) except of
aircraft parking ramps. This includes: Runway 05/23 (including both overruns and any area
within 100 feet of any runway edge); Taxiways Alpha, Bravo-1, Bravo-2, Charlie, Delta, Echo,
Foxtrot, and Papa; the north and south perimeter road around each end of the runway (when
traffic lights are not in operation), the Hot Cargo Pad, and the aircraft Rinse Rack.
Foreign Object Debris/Damage (FOD)—Any debris on the airfield that can cause damage to
an aircraft, equipment or personnel. A few examples are tools, plastic packing materials, rocks
and discarded parts from maintenance activities. Any of these objects can shred internal parts if
sucked into a jet engine and can become deadly projectiles. FOD can create an extremely
hazardous and costly situation during aircraft taxiing, takeoff, and landing. Therefore, it is
imperative that everyone on the airfield be alert to FOD and removes it immediately.
Government Owned Vehicle (GOV)—Any vehicle, including bicycles, wholly owned or leased
by the U.S. Government. The terms “Air Force Motor Vehicle (AFMV)” and GOV are
interchangeable.
Host/Wing Commander—Commanding officer, 482 FW. The ultimate authority for operations
on the airfield.
Parking Ramp/Apron—Areas where aircraft are parked, loaded/unloaded, and serviced
between flights. Vehicles and aircraft operate in close proximity in these areas, so it is vital to
maintain a safe distance between your vehicle and aircraft. Always yield to aircraft and never
drive under any part of an aircraft or its wings. Always use caution.
Privately Owned Vehicle (POV)—Any vehicle, including bicycles, not owned or leased by the
U.S. Government. NOTE: This includes contract company owned vehicles.
Restricted Area—Any area containing protection level resources. Protection level resources are
collected into defined areas and controlled using a single security control system. Restricted
areas are shown on the airfield by red lines painted on the pavement. Entry Control Points
(ECPs) are shown with a series of white and red lines on a black background with four reflectors
on each corner.
Runway Intrusion—A Controlled Movement Area (CMA) violation resulting from an
unauthorized entry of a runway or other surface used for takeoff and landing of aircraft,
regardless of impact on aircraft safety. These incidents can be caused by aircraft, vehicles,
pedestrians, or communication errors.
Unit ADPM—The civilian or military individual appointed in writing by the squadron/unit
commander to administer the organization’s vehicle airfield driving program, to include
coordinating with Wing ADPM for issuance of AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency,

                RADIO PROCEDURES AND PHRASEOLOGY ON HARB

Please note that this primer is in NO way intended to be all-inclusive. It is simply a short
introduction to proper radio communications on the airfield and is intended to familiarize you
with basic radio phraseology. The only real way to gain extensive knowledge of radio
phraseology and procedures is through on-the-job training.
An airfield is generally quite busy and inherently hazardous due to a number of factors including
taxiing, departing, and arriving aircraft; other vehicles; construction work; etc. For safety, you
must understand and use proper radio phraseology while driving your vehicle at any point on the
airfield. Radio communications, especially with Air Traffic Control (ATC), must be concise so
that transmission time is minimized, but all transmissions must be fully understood, as
well. Single words can mean an entire phrase. Sometimes, even single words which are not
commonly encountered in everyday use are used by ATC as important instructions. Also, you
must know and use the International Phonetic Alphabet and properly pronounce numbers to
avoid any confusion.
On Initial Contact with the Control Tower:
 Know your correct call sign. (Each vehicle should have a call sign identifying the vehicle.)
 Use proper phraseology. Never use Citizen's Band (CB) lingo or law-enforcement "ten-"
   codes.
 Keep communications clear, concise, and to-the-point. Think about what you’re going to
   say before calling Tower.
 Use the proper sequence in calling the Tower. Before you start talking, ensure no one else
   is already talking on that radio frequency. (NEVER step on another radio
   transmission!) Then, do the following in this order:
   o State who you’re calling (i.e. “Homestead Ground” on first radio call; after that,
     "Ground" will suffice).
   o State your call sign (i.e. “Airfield Three”).
   o Wait for Tower to respond. Once you receive a response from Tower, state where you are
     and where you want to go or what you want to do. Request your complete route from
     starting point to stopping point. (Example: “Homestead Ground, Airfield 3 at Flightline
     Road, request to enter Taxiways Bravo, Papa, Alfa for airfield inspection.”
   o Again, wait for Tower to respond. They’ll approve or deny your request, or issue special
     instructions. Always repeat Tower’s response verbatim (word-for-word), whether
     permissive or restrictive.
EXAMPLE #1 of proper communication (entering the Controlled Movement Area, or CMA):
   Vehicle: “Homestead Ground, Airfield 3.”
   Tower: “Airfield 3, Homestead Ground.”

  Vehicle: “Ground, Airfield 3 at Flightline Road, request to enter Taxiways Bravo, Papa,
  Alfa for airfield inspection.”
  Tower: “Airfield 3, Ground, approved to enter Taxiways Bravo, Papa, Alfa. Hold short of
  the runway.”
  Vehicle: “Ground, Airfield 3, entering Taxiways Bravo, Papa, Alfa. Will hold short of the
  runway.”
EXAMPLE #2 of proper communication (crossing the active runway):
  Vehicle: “Ground, Airfield 3.”
  Tower: “Airfield 3, Ground.”
  Vehicle: “Ground, Airfield 3, request to cross Runway Five at Taxiway Bravo-2.” (or)
  “Ground, Airfield 3 at Taxiway Bravo-2, request to cross Runway 5.” (Either is proper.)
  Tower: “Airfield 3, Ground, cross Runway 5 at Taxiway Bravo-2. Report when off.”
  Vehicle: “Ground, Airfield 3, crossing Runway 5 at Taxiway Bravo-2. Will advise when
  off.”
       ---> Then, once the runway crossing has been completed:
  Vehicle: “Ground, Airfield 3 is off Runway 5 at Taxiway Bravo-3.” (or) “Ground, Airfield
  3, runway crossing complete.” (Again, either is proper.)
  Tower: “Airfield 3, Ground, roger.”
EXAMPLE #3 of proper communication (entering the active runway):
  Vehicle: “Ground, Airfield 3.”
  Tower: “Airfield 3, Ground.”
  Vehicle: “Ground, Airfield 3 at Taxiway Echo, request to enter Runway Two Three.” (or)
  “Ground, Airfield 3, request to enter Runway 23 from Taxiway Echo.”
  Tower: “Airfield 3, Ground, hold short of Runway 23; landing traffic.” (An aircraft is on
  final approach.)
  Vehicle: “Ground, Airfield 3, holding short of Runway 23.”
      ---> Then, once the arriving aircraft has landed and passed the vehicle:
  Tower: “Airfield 3, Ground, proceed on Runway 23 at Taxiway Echo. Report when off.”
  Vehicle: “Ground, Airfield 3, proceeding onto Runway 23 from Taxiway Echo. Will advise
  when off.”
       ---> Then, once the vehicle has departed the runway:
  Vehicle: “Ground, Airfield 3 is off Runway 23 at Taxiway Alfa. Request to enter Taxiways
  Alfa, Papa, Bravo.”
  Tower: “Airfield 3, Ground, understand you’re off the runway. Proceed on Taxiways Alfa,
  Papa, Bravo.”

     Vehicle: “Ground, Airfield 3, entering Taxiways Alfa, Papa, Bravo.”


     Specific Phraseology / Terminology:
   “Acknowledge”: Let me know you have received and understand this message.
 “Advise intentions”: Tell me what your intentions are, or what you plan to do.
 “Affirmative”: Yes (or) That is correct.
 “Approved” (or) “Proceed”: Authorized to begin or continue moving, or perform a
   specific task or operation.
 “Approved as requested” (or) “Proceed as requested”: You are authorized to perform the
   task or operation exactly as you have requested. Note: This is THE ONE exception to the
   rule about repeating Tower’s instructions verbatim. Instead, acknowledge Tower by
   repeating your original intentions, and give them a chance to reply otherwise. (Example:
   Tower says, “Mower 1, Ground, proceed as requested.” Mower 1 should reply, “Ground,
   Mower 1, copy proceed onto CMA from Taxiway Bravo-1 and Flightline Road. Will hold
   short of the runway.”)
 “Clear” (or) “Cleared” (or) “Clearance”: Never, ever -- for any reason -- use the words
   "clear" or "cleared" in any radio transmission, EXCEPT in response to a radio check (i.e.
   "loud and clear"). Note: ATC uses these terms to "clear" aircraft for takeoff or landing, and
   the potential for a major mishap resulting from confusion is far too great. Instead, terms
   such as "Proceed on runway" or "Approved as requested" should be used.
 “Confirm …” (or) “Verify…”: Request confirmation of information given.
 “Correction…”: An error was made in the transmission and the correct version follows.
 “Expedite”: Do this without delay.
 “Go ahead”: State your request. Note: “Go ahead” NEVER means “proceed”.
   “Hold” (or) “Hold present position”: Stop where you are.
 “Hold short of...”: Proceed up to—but not into/onto/beyond—a specific point.
 “How do you hear me?”: How well is this radio working? How well can you hear my
   transmission?
 “Immediately”: Right now---with no delay. Note: You will probably never hear Tower say
   “Immediate” or “Immediately”, but if you do, it’s because of an immediate hazard or safety
   concern. Do as Tower directs right now. Use common sense and operate safely at all times;
   but otherwise, all other considerations are secondary.
 “Negative”: No (or) That is incorrect (or) Permission denied.
 “Read back”: Repeat my message back to me. Note: Tower uses this to ensure you
   understand what they are trying to tell you.

 “Roger” (or) “Copy”: I have received and understand your last transmission.
   Note: “Roger” and “Copy” do NOT mean “yes” or “will comply”!! Instead, use
   “Affirmative” for Yes, or “Wilco” for Will Comply.
   “Runway Five” (or) “Runway Two Three”: These are the correct terms. (Runway 5 is
     NOT “Runway Zero Five”, and Runway 23 is NOT “Runway Twenty Three”.)
 “Say again”: Repeat your transmission.
 “Speak slower”: Speak slower.
 “Stand by”: Wait a moment…I’ll get back to you. Note: If the delay after your call-up is
   lengthy, contact Tower again. Also, note that “Stand by” is neither an approval nor a denial.
 “Unable”: I cannot do as requested (or) I cannot approve that operation or task.
 “(Vehicle Call Sign) Plus Two (or other number)”: Tells the Tower the vehicle calling
   Tower is escorting other vehicles (for which the driver does not have an AF Form 483 for
   airfield driving) to a given place on the airfield. The number following the “plus” indicates
   the number of vehicles being escorted. Example: “Tower, Airfield 2 plus one, request to
   enter the CMA at Ammo Way and Taxiway Bravo-1.”
 “Wilco”: I have received your message, understand it, and will comply as directed.

Key Elements of Proper Radio Communication on the Airfield:
      Before contacting Tower, know precisely where you are on the airfield at all times. To
        aid you in this, know the airfield layout and the locations/designations of all runways,
        taxiways, and holding points.
      Speak clearly and at a moderate speed, especially if you have a strong regional or non-
        native accent.
HOMESTEADARBI13-213 7 MAY 2014                                                               41


   Always listen before starting a transmission, and be aware that there may be a short delay
     between any transmission and the corresponding reply.
   Press the radio transmit switch before beginning to speak, and do not release it until your
     transmission is complete. Otherwise, it may be "clipped", and an important part of the
     content lost.
   If you have any doubt about an instruction from the Tower, request they repeat the
     instruction by using the phrase, "Say again". When the instruction is repeated, make sure
     you understand it clearly and repeat it verbatim and in full before proceeding.
   Remember your designated radio call sign and listen for it at all times.
   If you ever become uncertain of your position, stop your vehicle immediately and inform
     the Tower. Wait until receiving instructions from them before moving again.
   Should you need to work outside your vehicle while you are under the Tower's direct
     control (i.e., inside the CMA), you must have a means of hearing calls from that agency,
     via vehicle loudspeaker or portable radio. Ensure it is audible at the prevailing
     (sometimes quite high) ambient noise level.
   Be aware of radio failure procedures, and be prepared to recognize the signs that this has
     in fact occurred. Know the different light gun signals that the Tower might use to attempt
     to communicate with you. And make certain you have an AFVA 11-240 (USAF Airport
     Signs and Signals) card prominently displayed and readily accessible in your vehicle. If
     you lose radio contact with the Control Tower, depart the Controlled Movement Area
     immediately. Transmit in the blind to Tower that you’ve departed the runway and the
     CMA (in case they can still hear you). Then, report off the runway and the CMA to
     Airfield Management Operations, ext. 7516 or 7072. They will so advise Tower.

                                 OPERATING PROCEDURES

A4.1. OPERATIONS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF AIRCRAFT:
   A4.1.1. When driving on parking ramps, drivers shall operate vehicles with driver’s side
   closest to the aircraft. Speed limit for vehicles operating within 25 feet of any aircraft is 5
   MPH. When parking within 25 feet of an aircraft, vehicles shall be forward of the wing tip
   and in clear view of the cockpit with driver’s side closest to the aircraft and the vehicle’s
   wheels chocked. Only those vehicles performing aircraft servicing operations shall operate
   closer than 10 feet from an aircraft (the “Circle of Safety”) and then pre-positioned chocks
   and spotters shall be used between the vehicle and aircraft to prevent contact. When parking
   along a taxiway, vehicle must be at least 25 feet off the paved surface. Allow at least 25 feet
   of wing tip clearance when yielding the right of way to aircraft. Vehicles must have 25 feet
   of clearance on each side before passing between aircraft. Safe operating distance between
   vehicles and aircraft while aircraft engines are in operation are:
       A4.1.1.1. *NO CLOSER than 25 feet in front.
       A4.1.1.2. *NO CLOSER than 200 feet to the rear.
       A4.1.1.3. *NO CLOSER than 500 feet for C-130 and larger aircraft, when at full power.
   A4.1.2. Do not get too close to aircraft as damage or injury could occur if the engine is
   started. Jet blast or prop wash can be extremely dangerous! Flashing beacons located on
   the tail, top, and/or bottom of the aircraft indicate the engine is running or about to start.
(**)Note: Transient Alert vehicles are the only vehicles authorized to drive in the direct path of
taxiing aircraft.
A4.2. FOD CONTROL AND PREVENTION: The major sources of FOD on an airfield
are vehicles and personnel. Trash can be sucked into an aircraft engine and cause extensive
damage. Trash can puncture tires and dent or puncture wings and other parts of an aircraft
making the aircraft unsafe. Personnel can be struck by debris blown backwards by a jet engine’s
exhaust. You can help make your airfield a safer place by referring to 482FWI 21-101 and
following these basic guidelines:
   A4.2.1. *Remove any debris from tire treads before entering the airfield.
   A4.2.2. *Put all your trash in a covered container that won't be blown over.
   A4.2.3. *If the vehicle has dual rear tires – check between the tires.
   A4.2.4. *Pick up trash and rocks.
   A4.2.5. *Look out for nails, bolts, and other small metal pieces that can puncture tires easily.
   A4.2.6. *Be responsible for watches and rings and pens and pencils.
   A4.2.7. *Perform a FOD CHECK immediately after re-entering pavement area from grassy
   areas.
A4.3. UNIQUE (UNIT-SPECIFIC) VEHICLE OPERATIONS:
HOMESTEADARBI13-213 7 MAY 2014                                                                    45


   A4.3.1. Alert Aircraft Scrambles: Maintain constant vigilance while operating vehicles in
   the areas of the airfield adjacent to taxi-ways E and B, where often without warning, aircraft
   will have to scramble for takeoff. Whenever the Tower broadcasts an active aircraft
   scramble, or you view flashing lights at gate of the Florida Air National Guard ramp, vehicle
   operator must hold short as directed by control tower personnel.
   A4.3.2. Sweeper Operations: Sweeper vehicle operations take place on all paved surfaces,
   making frequent stops and U turns collecting debris that could be blown in by the wind and
   carried on and deposited by vehicles and even vibrated loose and fallen from aircraft itself.
   The sweeper operator might be concentrating on debris in front of him, so a wide path around
   the vehicle is advised.
   A4.3.3. Airfield Grass and Weed Cutters/Groundskeepers: These operators drive a
   variety of vehicles in order to maintain the grassy parts of the airfield at an established height
   and to ensure proper airfield signage and lights are visible for the rest of us. These vehicles
   range from tractors and mowers to hovercraft and even standard weed eaters. Pay close
   attention to where and when you operate or travel around the airfield. Remember: Most of
   their equipment is quite loud, and they may not hear you as you drive up.
   A4.3.4. Barrier Maintenance: These personnel maintain the aircraft arresting system
   located on both ends of the runway. The above ground cables raised with rubber doughnuts
   in the over run near the landing threshold of each end and the recessed cables about a
   thousand feet from each end. These cable systems help stop hook equipped aircraft stop
   during emergency situations, as such we need to drive carefully when operating vehicles in
   their vicinity. Try not to drive directly over the rubber supports as this can cause damage to
   the system.
A4.4. NIGHT AND INCLEMENT WEATHER CONDITIONS:
Night driving and poor weather conditions can be hazardous to drive in. Rain, fog, wind and
poor lighting will affect the normal operation of the airfield, as well as your work. Here are a
few precautions to remember when driving at night or in poor weather conditions: IF YOU ARE
ON THE RUNWAY AND NOTICE THE RUNWAY LIGHTS FLASHING, DEPART
THE RUNWAY IMMEDIATELY, AND LOOK AT THE TOWER FOR LIGHT GUN
SIGNALS. THIS MEANS THAT YOUR RADIO HAS FAILED AND THE CONTROL
TOWER IS UNABLE TO CONTACT YOU.
   A4.4.1. Night driving:
   A4.4.2. Headlights are required. When converging with aircraft, switch to parking lights or
   hazard flashers and yield right of way. Failure to follow this procedure could result in night
   blindness of the pilot.
   A4.4.3. When parked on the airfield, you must leave the parking or hazard lights on
   and leave the keys in the ignition. Ensure aircraft will have at least 25 feet of wing tip
   clearance from the vehicle.
   A4.4.4. Poor weather conditions:
       A4.4.4.1. Secure any loose objects in the open areas of your vehicle to prevent them
       from blowing out while driving.
       A4.4.4.2. Test brakes, headlights, and windshield wipers on vehicle before you leave.
46                                                    HOMESTEADARBI13-213 7 MAY 2014


     A4.4.4.3. Drive slower than normal. Braking distance may be 2 to 10 times greater on
     wet surfaces.
     A4.4.4.4. When notified of lightning within 5 miles of the airfield, stop all outside
     activities and return to your unit until weather condition is terminated.
A4.5. DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR MOBILE OBSTACLES:
  A4.5.1. Vehicles or wheeled equipment (light carts, power carts, jammers, toolboxes and
  extinguishers taller than 24 inches) shall not be left unattended within 25 feet of any parked
  aircraft or taxiway. Vehicles and equipment shall be removed when no longer needed for
  servicing, launching or recovering aircraft. This same requirement exists for the runway
  clear zone, extending 200 feet beyond each end and 1000 feet on either side of the runway
  centerline.
A4.6. PERSONNEL PROCEDURES:
  A4.6.1. Driving on taxiways and ramps will be kept to a minimum and in direct support of
  mission aircraft. Use of perimeter roads shall be used to the highest extent possible as there
  are no FOD checks required and the speed limit is 25, until you finally enter the aircraft
  operating area.
     A4.6.1.1. NEVER cross the runway or drive onto the runway unless specifically
     authorized to do so by the procedures outlined in here, and only with approval from the
     control tower when operating within 100 feet of the runway and Controlled Movement
     Area.
     A4.6.1.2. Vehicle operators will do FOD checks prior to entering the airfield (taxiways,
     parking aprons, etc). Check ALL tire tread surfaces, then pull your vehicle forward for
     one half of a turn of the tires, then check all tire treads again for debris stuck in the treads.
     FOD checks will be accomplished when entering or crossing any taxiway, ramp, or
     runway from an access road/unpaved surface or when exiting a construction area.
     A4.6.1.3. Do not cross taxiways when an approaching aircraft is within 200 feet or until
     it has passed by at least 500 feet. Larger aircraft can blow over light and top-heavy
     vehicles at great distances.
     A4.6.1.4. Always yield to taxiing aircraft and emergency response vehicles. When seen
     or heard start moving out of their way, but do not stop where they might need to be.
     A4.6.1.5. Vehicles stopped for aircraft holding on a taxiway will not cross the taxiway in
     front of the aircraft unless signaled to do so by the pilot and air traffic control (tower)
     personnel.
     A4.6.1.6. Remain at least 100 feet from helicopters with rotors in motion. Watch out for
     rotor wash as it can disrupt normal vehicle operations.
     A4.6.1.7. Exercises or other priority maintenance missions are NOT emergencies. You
     must adhere to established speed limits. Safety has to come first.
     A4.6.1.8. Personal radios will not be used in vehicles operating on the airfield. This
     includes AM/FM radios, tape players, and personal stereos (walkmans, etc.). Your
     attention needs to be focused on the critical safety items listed in this instruction.
HOMESTEADARBI13-213 7 MAY 2014                                                               47


     A4.6.1.9. Perimeter roads: No vehicle will be allowed to drive on airfield perimeter
     roads when visibility is below 300 feet at ground level. Critical aircraft instrument
     landing systems used by approaching aircraft could be affected by vehicles on the the
     north and south perimeter roads (curving around each end of the runway). Should it
     become necessary to travel around the perimeter roads and the perimeter road traffic
     lights are green, proceed straight along the length of the perimeter road and past the ILS
     Glide Slope antenna (stopping ONLY at the final approach corridor on the south
     perimeter road, where you must look along the arrival corridors of both ends of the
     runway for inbound aircraft and at the north end of the runway for any opposite-direction
     departures toward you).
A4.7. ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES:
  A4.7.1. Depending on the infraction committed, Airfield Management, Unit VCOs and
  Commanders are empowered to order retraining and may suspend airfield driving privileges.
  Because runway incursions and Controlled Movement Area violations (CMAV) can be so
  hazardous, jeopardizing personnel and equipment, they will result in an automatic six-month
  suspension. In all cases, the Unit Commander will be notified, and your name will be
  reported at all staff meetings during the suspension period. You are responsible for
  preventing runway incursions and CMAVs on the airfield through constant vigilance and
  situational awareness. If you are unclear on any radio transmissions from the tower, ask for
  clarification before proceeding. Also remember that the entire airfield is monitored via video
  surveillance and all radio frequencies are monitored and recorded. Upon attaining your AF
  Form 483 certifying you to drive on the airfield, you will be responsible for many safety
  issues. Many of these attachments are printable; make sure you have them with you until you
  become thoroughly knowledgeable and fully comfortable with driving on the airfield.

                     TDY AND CONTRACTOR PERSONEL BRIEFING

A5.1. General. This letter reiterates policies and procedures for control of vehicle operations on
the airfield in accordance with Homestead Air Reserve Base Instruction 13-213, Airfield
Driving. It authorizes TDY personnel qualified to drive on their home station airfield, and in
possession of an AF Form 483, Certificate of Competency issued by their home base, to operate
on the airfield at Homestead ARB. Airfield vehicle operations are covered in AFMAN 24-306
(Chapter 20) and AFI 91-203 (Chapter 24), and must be strictly complied with. Keep this letter,
a copy of the airfield diagram, and a copy of your orders with you while driving on our airfield.
Airfield driving privileges are good only for the duration of the TDY and/or contract.
A5.2. Precautions.
   A5.2.1. Driving on taxiways and ramps will be kept to a minimum and in direct support of
   mission aircraft.
   A5.2.2. Never cross the runway or drive onto the runway unless specifically authorized to do
   so by the procedures outlined in HARBI 13-213, and only with approval from the Control
   Tower when operating within 100 feet of the runway or elsewhere within the CMA.
   A5.2.3. Vehicle operators will do FOD checks prior to entering the airfield (taxiways,
   parking aprons, etc). FOD checks will be accomplished when entering or crossing any
   taxiway, ramp, or runway from an access road/unpaved surface or when exiting a
   construction area.
   A5.2.4. Do not cross taxiways when an approaching aircraft is within 200 feet or until it has
   passed by 200 feet.
   A5.2.5. Always yield to taxiing aircraft and emergency response vehicles (which will have
   their emergency lights and sirens operating).
   A5.2.6. Vehicles stopped for aircraft holding on a taxiway will not cross the taxiway in front
   of the aircraft unless signaled to do so by the pilot.
   A5.2.7. Remain at least 100 feet from helicopters with rotors in motion.
   A5.2.8. Exercises or other priority maintenance missions (including “Red Ball”) are not
   emergencies. You must adhere to established speed limits.
   A5.2.9. No personal radios (including AM/FM radios, tape players, etc.) will be used in
   vehicles on the airfield.
   A5.2.10. The South and North Perimeter Roads will not be used unless direct two-way radio
   contact is established with the Control Tower and permission received from them, when
   perimeter road lights are not working.
   A5.2.11. Always drive on the far right side of a taxiway.
   A5.2.12. Do not pass a stopped or towed aircraft unless the aircrew or marshaller indicates
   that you may proceed. Maintain at least 25 feet lateral clearance from the aircraft’s wingtip.
   A5.2.13. If you encounter an aircraft coming towards you, do one of the following:
HOMESTEADARBI13-213 7 MAY 2014                                                                  49


       A5.2.13.1. Turn around and exit the taxiway at the next paved surface.
       A5.2.13.2. As a last resort, drive into a grassy area and maintain at least a 25-foot
       wingtip clearance for the aircraft to pass. However, before driving on to the paved
       surface again, you must check the tires for FOD.
A5.3. Speed Limits. Refer to paragraph 3.1.9 of this instruction.
A5.4. Parking:
   A5.4.1. Never leave a vehicle unattended on a taxiway.
   A5.4.2. Do not park closer than 25 feet in front of or 200 feet to the rear of any aircraft when
   engines are running or are about to start.
   A5.4.3. All vehicles parked and left unattended on the airfield will have the ignition turned
   off. Keys will remain in the ignition and the door will be unlocked.
   A5.4.4. Place the vehicle in park (automatic transmissions), or reverse (manual
   transmissions).
   A5.4.5. Set the foot/hand brake and do not point the vehicle so it will roll towards any
   aircraft. Additionally, the vehicle must not be parked in any manner that will impede other
   aircraft and/or vehicle traffic.
A5.5. Foreign Object Damage (FOD) Prevention. A FOD potential exists at all airports. If you
see debris on or near the airfield, you must remove it. If there is too much debris to pick up
yourself, call Airfield Management at ext. 7516/7071 or the Tower on the Ramp Net (channel
15) and request a sweeper.
A5.6. Night Driving. During darkness (sunset to sunrise), vehicle operators will not shine their
headlights toward oncoming aircraft. Pull over to the side, turn off the headlights, and turn on
the vehicle parking lights.
A5.7. Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Procedures:
   A5.7.1. The CMA is defined as Runway 05/23, overruns, and within 100 feet of these areas,
   plus all taxiways and taxilanes except taxiway B-3. ALL vehicle movement within the CMA
   must have approval from the Control Tower.
       A5.7.1.1. Vehicles and/or personnel will not operate in the CMA unless necessary to
       perform mission essential duties. TDY/contractor personnel without an AF Form 483 for
       HARB will be escorted by the sponsoring/host unit.
       A5.7.1.2. Vehicles in the CMA must have direct two-way radio with the control tower,
       and must monitor the Tower ramp net frequency while in the movement area.
   A5.7.2. Come to a complete stop at the runway or instrument hold line.
   A5.7.3. Inform the tower of your location and of your intentions.
   A5.7.4. Repeat the tower’s instructions verbatim and then comply with those instructions.
   A5.7.5. Advise the tower when you have departed the Controlled Movement Area.
A5.8. Contractors’ Airfield Driving Briefing: Additional requirements:
50                                                  HOMESTEADARBI13-213 7 MAY 2014


  A5.8.1. Contractor(s) will sign in at Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) at the
  beginning of their work day and sign out at AMOPS at the end of their work day.
  A5.8.2. Contractor(s) will follow a designated route to the work/project site.
  A5.8.3. Contractor(s) vehicles will not be escorted unless prior coordination and permission
  are granted from the Airfield Manager.
  A5.8.4. Vehicles will be clean and FOD free, and the work site kept clean and orderly (to the
  maximum extent possible).
  A5.8.5. Contractors may be asked to leave the area due to mission requirements.
  A5.8.6. These are the minimum briefing requirements for TDY and contractor personnel.
  Unit ADPMs may add additional or unique unit requirements as necessary.
