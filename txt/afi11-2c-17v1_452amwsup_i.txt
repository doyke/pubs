                                            Chapter 1

                                           GENERAL

1.1. Training Objective. This instruction prescribes basic policy and guidance for training
USAF C-17 crewmembers according to AFI 11-202v1, Aircrew Training.
     1.1.1. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop and maintain a
     high state of mission readiness for the immediate and effective employment in exercises,
     peacekeeping operations, contingencies, and war in any environment. Mission readiness and
     effective employment are achieved through the development and mastery of core
     competencies for C-17 crewmembers. These core competencies include the ability to
     conduct air refueling, tactical ingress, tactical egress, airdrop (for qualified crewmembers),
     assault landings, NVG operations during all phases of flight, instrument procedures, mission
     planning, landing zone ground operations, crew management, and C4/AOC integration.
     Another objective of the aircrew training program is to link AFTTP 3-3.C-17, Combat
     Aircraft Fundamentals requirements into mission and continuation training tables while
     retaining a combat culture, leading edge technologies, pushing capabilities while anticipating
     warfighter needs.
     1.1.2. The second objective is to standardize C-17 training requirements into a single
     document to meet requirements for a basic document in AFI 11-200.
     1.1.3. Although this publication governs C-17 aircrew training, it also refers to requirements
     and guidance contained in other referenced AFIs. Before incorporating guidance from these
     sources, review them to ensure the reference is still current. If there is a conflict with
     respect to a training requirement, follow the guidance contained in the AFI that originally
     established the requirement.
1.2. Key Words Explained.
     1.2.1. “Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.2.2. “Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.2.3. “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.2.4. “Note” indicates operating procedure, techniques, etc., which are considered essential
     to emphasize.
1.3. Administration.
     1.3.1. Local Training Guidance. Units may supplement this instruction and will submit an
     info copy to the parent MAJCOM OPR after approval by the OG/CC. ANG is considered a
     MAJCOM for purposes of this instruction.
     1.3.2. If a conflict is identified for a training requirement, comply with the source document
     that establishes the training requirement.
1.4. Responsibilities. AFI 11-202v1 outlines responsibilities for aircrew training.

         minutes for a period of two years from the date of the panel meeting (commanders
         may increase this frequency as required). Squadrons and detachments not collocated
         with their OG may conduct their own panel or provide representation to their OG
         TRP. Panel minutes from non-collocated squadron and detachment TRPs will be
         forwarded to their OG training office for inclusion in their OG TRP.
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                     11


        1.4.5.1.2. TRP Format. The TRP should review staff and crewmember management
        actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training programs.
        Suggested TRP topics include, but are not limited to: Current and forecast Flight
        Training Levels (FTL), upgrade and Continuation Training (CT) status, semi-annual
        requirement completion rates, crew position gains/losses, Aircraft Commander (AC),
        Instructor, and Evaluator upgrades. OG/CC’s should review all “X” events for
        relevancy to the unit’s mission during the TRP. This review will be documented in
        the TRP minutes.
     1.4.5.2. OG/CCs will develop and maintain procedures with their local servicing Military
     Personnel Flight (MPF) for individual crewmember counseling and personnel system
     updates affecting an Active Duty Service Commitment (ADSC) incurred from training
     described in this AFI. See AFI 11-202v1, AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service
     Commitments, and course listing in ETCA for more information.
     1.4.5.3. OG/CCs may develop additional training requirements and/or programs as
     necessary to meet unit mission requirements. Units may include such requirements in a
     local supplement to this AFI or a local operational instruction.
     1.4.5.3. (452AMW) The 452d Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) has delegated
     this responsibility to the 729th Airlift Squadron/ Directorate of Operations, Training (729
     AS/DOT). Unique C-17 training program information can be found on the 452 OG
     Training            Community              of          Practice          (CoP)           at:
     https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=RC-OP-01-52.
     1.4.5.4. The OG/CC is responsible for establishing and maintaining the academic
     training program for non-TS courses (may be delegated to squadron level). The OG (or
     squadron) OPR will:
        1.4.5.4.1. Appoint primary and alternate instructors for each non-TS course to be
        taught.
        1.4.5.4.2. Publish a ground training schedule (ANG/AFRC, as required) to include
        date, time, location, instructor/course OPR and designated crewmembers for each
        course (both TS and non-TS). Units may include such details in a local supplement to
        this AFI.
        1.4.5.4.2. (452AMW) The 452d Operations Support Squadron/Training Division
        (452 OSS/OST) will publish annual and monthly ground training schedules available
        on           the          452           OG           Training        CoP          at:
        https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=RC-OP-01-52.
        Scheduling of individual crewmembers is the squadron’s responsibility but may be
        augmented by 452 OSS/OST, if required. The 452 OSS/OST has the sole
        responsibility of scheduling with the various base agencies concerning frequency and
        location of training classes. Aircrew Training System (ATS) scheduling and training
        device availability are the responsibility of the ATS contractor.
        1.4.5.4.3. Use MAJCOM, TS, or unit-developed training products and/or syllabus for
        all courses, as applicable. Units will reproduce courseware, as applicable. Document
        training in accordance with Appendix 2.
12                                   AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014


         1.4.5.4.4. Develop a procedure to monitor the academic training program for course
         content, currency of materials, instructor availability, and status of training aids.
         Squadrons recommend to the commander changes to existing courses or additional
         academic training courses required, based on crewmember feedback.
     1.4.5.5. Instructor Selection and Training. OG/CC or designated representative will
     select course instructors for non-TS courses on the basis of professional qualifications
     and aptitude to teach. Local academic instructor program will follow guidance in
     AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for Air Force Instructors. Instructors will receive credit for
     the courses they teach.
         1.4.5.5.1. Send recommendations for changes, additions, and deletions of courses
         through appropriate channels to appropriate MAJCOM with an information copy to
         HQ AMC/A3T.
  1.4.6. Squadrons. SQ/CC (or designated representative) will:
     1.4.6.1. Select DOT Chiefs/Flight CCs from the most highly qualified and experienced
     instructors. Previous Evaluator or FTU experience is highly desired. ARC units with a
     single Sq may use the OST Chief for this purpose.
     1.4.6.2. Ensure SQ/DOT is manned with a minimum of one instructor pilot and one
     instructor loadmaster. Instructors should be selected based on experience, availability,
     and time on station (to ensure continuity of operations for each crew position in DOT).
     ARC units with a single Sq may use OST for this purpose.
     1.4.6.3. Convene a Squadron Training Review Panel (STRP) to be chaired by the SQ/CC
     and/or SQ/DO. Panel members should include representatives from squadron training,
     squadron stan/eval, ADOs, and the chief from each crew position. Squadrons should
     utilize the STRP to focus training objectives, ensure standards are being met, select
     upgrade candidates, and ensure completion of required continuation training.
         1.4.6.3.1. STRP Requirements. Squadrons will convene a STRP monthly (Quarterly
         for AFRC and NGB) and maintain minutes for a period of two years from date of
         panel meeting. STRP minutes will be approved by the SQ/CC (or SQ/DO) and may
         be produced/distributed/stored electronically by the SQ/DOT.
         1.4.6.3.2. STRP Format. The STRP will review staff and crewmember management
         actions necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training programs. The
         STRP will review the current status of aircrew training to ensure that current training
         objectives are being met and that those individuals selected for upgrade training are
         the best candidates after reviewing their experience, proficiency level, and
         retainability. To accomplish these goals, suggested STRP topics include but are not
         limited to: crew position gains/losses, current upgrade/requalification training (i.e.
         crewmembers in an active training status), recently completed training (including
         performance during training and current certification status), future training
         (individuals already approved via STRP), upgrade candidates, current waivers,
         projected waivers, and continuation training status.

      1.4.6.4. Progression. Ensure crewmembers complete in-unit mission, ground, and
      continuation training programs. Failure to reasonably progress may require action for
      removal.
      1.4.6.5. Before each semi-annual training period assign Flying Training Levels (FTL) to
      all assigned and attached crewmembers (see Chapter 4).
      1.4.6.6. Ensure formal school post-graduate questionnaires are completed. Each gaining
      unit will need one or more supervisors to complete the graduate evaluation surveys.
      Complete       the      questionnaires      on      the      AETC      web-site     at:
      https://www.my.af.mil/agepiftprod. The questionnaire will be completed NLT 120
      calendar days after student graduation from formal training.
      1.4.6.7. Ensure effective training continuity and supervision of assigned and attached
      crewmembers. Squadron commanders may assign additional requirements based on
      individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency. Document all flying training and
      training reviews in TMS.
      1.4.6.8. Review training and evaluation records of newly assigned or attached
      crewmember and those completing formal training, to determine the necessary training
      required to complete/certify the individual as Basic Aircraft Qualified (BAQ), Basic
      Mission Capable (BMC), or Mission Ready (MR).
      1.4.6.9. Review qualifications and monitor training requirements for squadron-assigned
      Flight Surgeons.
      1.4.6.10. Execute squadron-level aircrew certifications described in this instruction.

approval.
1.6. Use of Flying Hours.
   1.6.1. Structure unit flying training missions to achieve optimum training. Any by-product
   airlift opportunity resulting from training must not degrade the intended training and will
   comply with applicable Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 4515.3R, Air
   Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management and AFI 11-202v1.
       1.6.1.1. It is essential that all personnel at every level prevent the misuse of air mobility
       resources as well as the perception of their misuse when planning and executing local or
       off-station training missions.
       1.6.1.2. See AFI 11-2C-17v3, C-17 Operations Procedures, for off-station training flight
       requirements.
   1.6.2. Training on Operational Missions. Unless specifically prohibited or restricted by
   weapon system operating procedures or specific theater operations order (OPORD), the
   OG/CC exercising operational control may approve upgrade, qualification or special
   qualification training on operational missions. In order to maximize efficient utilization of
   training resources, 618 TACC and tasked units will jointly identify and take maximum
   advantage of opportunities to conduct appropriate continuation training items which may be
   conveniently suited to concurrent operational mission segments. Examples include low-
   levels, assault landings, EROs, circling approaches and air refueling. If necessary, 618
   TACC and tasked units will coordinate training mission numbers for the specific mission
   segment. Commanders will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness and the
   crewmember receiving training is under the supervision of an instructor of like specialty.
   Comply with passenger-carrying restrictions in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and AFI
   11-2C-17v3.
1.7. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Comply with the time limitations in Table 1.2.
Crewmembers entered in an in-unit training program leading to qualification (or re-qualification)
will be dedicated to that training program on a full-time basis.

Table 1.2. In-Unit Training Time Limitations.

Training                                     Time Limit                 Time Limit ARC

   1.7.1. Training start date is the date of the first significant training event contributing to
   qualification, certification or upgrade of the crewmember (e.g., Loadmaster Simulator (LS),
   Weapon System Trainer (WST), flight, etc), or 45 calendar days (90 calendar days for ANG
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                     17


   and AF Reserve) following a member’s reporting to the unit following completion of a
   formal school, whichever occurs first. Training time ends with the syllabus completion.
   1.7.2. SQ/CC may extend training time up to 60 calendar days (120 calendar days for ARC)
   through appropriate documentation in TMS; no notification to MAJCOM/A3T (or
   equivalent) is required. Extensions exceeding 60 calendar days (120 calendar days for ARC)
   require MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) approval. Units will request an extension through the
   appropriate MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent). AMC active duty units use the waiver web
   linked at the AMC/A3T web site before the crewmember exceeds upgrade training time
   limits.
1.8. Training Documentation. C-17 units will utilize TMS to document training (See
Attachment 2). Units utilize AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew Qualification
Worksheet, to update aircrew certifications in ARMS. Blocks 5 – 6 will be used to document
initial, upgrade of, or downgrade of aircrew qualification. The ARMS Upgrade Worksheet will
also be used to document award of specific ARMS “Q” code identifiers. Specifically, block 22
will contain the following minimum information: “Q” code (i.e. QXXX), Certification Name
(i.e. Phoenix Banner), and date of certification. See Chapter 7 for specific “Q” codes.
1.9. Flight Examiner Usage. Use flight evaluators as instructors for any phase of training to
capitalize on their expertise and experience. Units may use flight evaluators as instructors for
qualification, local upgrade, or corrective-action training. If an evaluator is the primary
instructor to train an individual, the same evaluator should not administer the associated
evaluation.
1.10. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements.
   1.10.1. All instructors should be MR (wing level and below). Instructors must be current
   and qualified in any event that they instruct. Formal Training Unit (FTU) instructors are only
   required to maintain BMC.
   1.10.2. When performing crewmember duties, the following personnel will be under direct
   supervision of an instructor of like specialty:
       1.10.2.1. All non-current crewmembers (See paragraph 4.10).
       1.10.2.2. All crewmembers in initial, upgrade, or re-qualification flying training unless
       syllabus states direct supervision is not required.
       1.10.2.3. All crewmembers performing restricted flying events listed on the AF Form 8
       as prescribed by AFI 11-202v2 , Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program
       Organization and Administration.
       1.10.2.4. Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ) graduate pilots (MPD) performing pilot-flying
       (PF) duties during air refueling and assault landings.
       1.10.2.5. Loadmasters in mission ready training. (Loadmasters may fly unsupervised on
       local training sorties after completion of a local orientation flight.)
       1.10.2.6. Unqualified, FTL E, or MAJCOM staff crew members on indoctrination flight
       orders.
       1.10.2.7. Any other personnel designated by the wing, OG, or SQ/CC.
 18                                    AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014


   1.10.3. For unqualified and Flying Training Level (FTL) E pilots, an instructor must be at a
   set of controls during critical phases of flight.
1.11. Distribution. Units will establish distribution requirements of this AFI.
1.12. Transfer of Aircrews. Before a crewmember will interfly from one unit to another, the
gaining unit will review and assess their qualification and currency. See also AFI 11-401.
   1.12.1. A crewmember qualified in the C-17 according to AFI 11-202v2 will be considered
   qualified throughout the C-17 force. Certified/qualified MR crewmember transferring
   between units, accomplish only unit specific training and any applicable events in which they
   have lost currency. See AFI 11-2C-17v3, Interfly, for additional information.
   1.12.2. For Foreign Military Sales (FMS), guest pilot, and/or exchange officers see training
   requirements in AFI 11-401. Initial and/or continuation training requirements are specified
   in the appropriate MOU, OPLAN, or agreement and should mirror requirements of this AFI
   to maximum extent possible.
1.13. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is “duty not involving
flying” (DNIF) may complete ground training events or simulator training if the member's
physical condition allows it. If unqualified, simulator events logged while DNIF do not count as
semi-annual currency events. Consult the flight surgeon initiating AF Form 1042, Medical
Recommendation for Flying or Special operational Duty, action (prescribed by AFI 48-123,
Medical Examinations and Standards) if the DNIF status includes ground training limitations.
1.14. Aircrew Rated Management Overview.
   1.14.1. Programmed Flying Training (PFT). AETC/A3R manages the training command’s
   role in the AF/A3O Flying Training CONOPS. A key product of this process is the PFT.
   The PFT balances available training quotas, FTU capacity, and course requirements on a
   fiscal year basis. Annually, at the request of the MAJCOM training staff, units will send
   projected PFT requirements to their respective MAJCOM training staff which will forward
   projections to AETC/A3R.
       1.14.1.1. AF/A3O sponsors an annual PFT conference to balance pipeline production
       requirements and MAJCOM training requests against FTU capacity. AETC/A3R
       allocates quotas to lead and user commands who, in turn, allocate training quotas to each
       unit.
       1.14.1.2. Throughout the training year, MAJCOM training staff and AETC PFT
       managers use assigned/allocated training quotas to assign individual crewmembers into
       the C-17 formal schools. Daily student quota adjustments to the annual PFT are made on
       quota management documents.
1.15. Information Management. AMC/A3T hosts crewmember training information on web
site: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-AM-81 ANG
hosts        crewmember         training     information      on      web      site:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/community/views/home.aspx?Filter=OO-OP-AN-G6
1.16. Failure to Progress or Complete Training. If a student fails to progress according to
syllabus or training requirements, the command accomplishing the training will conduct a
Progress Review (PR) IAW AFI 11-202v1. The TS contractor will identify students who fail to
progress according to the TS contract (see Chapter 6).
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                      19


1.17. Career Enlisted Aviators (CEA). The determination of CEA qualification is separate
and distinct from skill level upgrades. When an AF Form 8 is completed for the applicable flight
evaluation, then that crewmember is qualified to perform all duties assigned to that crew
qualification regardless of skill level. Aircrew instructor and flight examiner qualifications are
also separate and distinct from On-the-Job Training (OJT) trainer or certifier designation and are
reflected in Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) by use of “K” prefix (aircrew instructor) and “Q”
prefix (aircrew flight examiner) identifiers.
1.18. Aircrew Training Quota Management. The following information describes AMC’s
policy and procedures for quota management. This policy was developed from requirements in
AFI 36-2201, Air Force Military Training Program, 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments
(ADSC), and AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management. This policy is mandatory for all AMC units.
All other units follow MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) guidance.
   1.18.1. AMC Units: Formal Aircrew Training requirements (except for Simulator Refresher
   requirements) will be submitted to the appropriate AMC/A3TF quota manager NLT 30 Sep
   for the following fiscal year. AMC/A3TF will consolidate and crosscheck requests with the
   Pilot Absorption Management System (PAMS) and submit to Air Staff via the annual
   Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD) Data Call and finalized at the annual
   PFT conference.
       1.18.1.1. Other MAJCOMS: Submit Formal Aircrew Training requirements to
       appropriate MAJCOM Functional Managers NLT 30 Sep for the following fiscal year.
       The Formal Aircrew Training requirements (except for Simulator Refresher
       requirements) will be internally coordinated by MAJCOM functional managers and
       submitted to Air Staff via the annual GPRD Data Call and finalized at the annual PFT
       conference.
   1.18.2. OSS training offices will submit the rank, full name, course, and class number to
   AMC/A3TF NLT 45 calendar days prior to class start date (CSD) (65 calendar days for all
   Joint Airdrop Inspector (JAI) courses. Please ensure that any internal processes are adjusted
   to meet this timeline. Training quotas not filled 30 calendar days prior to CSD will be
   offered to the next unit on the AMC/A3TF standby list. OSS training offices should
   reconfirm all scheduled training with their units at least 10 calendar days prior to CSD to
   ensure notification of training, active duty service commitments are established, and orders
   issued.    Please submit all candidates for training quotas using email only to:
   AMC.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil. For J5AZA1A251 0F5A (JAI), and J5AZB1A251
   0M5A Mobile Training Teams (MTT), in addition to the information required in paragraph
   1.18.4.1, provide unit mailing address, duty title, security clearance, supervisor’s name and
   duty phone, fax number, and e-mail address. Send requests for “Type 5” info template to:
   AMC.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil. AFRC units will submit the rank, full name,
   SSAN, course, and class number to AFRC/A3TA NLT 60 calendar days prior to class start
   date (CSD) using email only to” AFRC.A3TA@AFRC.AF.MIL.
       1.18.2.1. All course prerequisites should be completed NLT 30 calendar days prior to
       CSD to allow for remedial training or substitution. Units will internally identify an
       alternate candidate for each allocated quota.
20                                   AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014


     1.18.2.2. Training Line Numbers (TLNs) are not to be used for any alternate candidates.
     Units will request cancellation and reissue of TLNs for the aircrew training schedule
     through MAJCOM Quota Manager.
  1.18.3. When submitting local upgrade (secondary method) requests, use the AMC/A3TF
  web-site: https://private.AMC.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/waivers/userlogin.cfm.
     1.18.3.1. Forward the following information to the appropriate quota manager: rank,
     name, upgrade, course, projected start, projected completion, and a point of contact.
     Inform via e-mail when training is complete. If the training being conducted would
     normally incur an active duty service commitment (ADSC), insure required counseling
     and AF Form 63 is completed prior to start of training. Contact your local MPF Formal
     Training office for additional guidance. MILPDS training RIPs will automatically
     generate ADSC requirements.
  1.18.4. When a training allocation cannot be filled, the OSS training office will notify
  AMC/A3TF so the quota may be reallocated. If circumstances prevent an identified
  candidate from attending the training (e.g., DNIF, unable to complete prerequisite training,
  etc.), inform AMC/A3TF immediately. Return all unused quotas to AMC/A3TF NLT 45
  calendar days prior to CSD.
  1.18.5. All no-shows and late cancellations within 7 calendar days of CSD must be
  explained. Forward an initial report of circumstances to AMC/A3TF quota management
  office within 24 hours of CSD. This initial notification will be followed by a memorandum
  of explanation from the OG/CC to AMC/A3T within one week. E-mail is the preferred
  method.          Send     to:       AMC.A3T@scott.af.mil            and    courtesy   copy
  AMC.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil.
  1.18.6. Global Reach Aircraft Commanders Course (GRACC). Active duty units will be
  given priority over AFRC and ANG units due to mandatory upgrade requirements for AMC
  crews established in AFI 11-MDS-v1. Do not submit more than two candidates per wing per
  class without the GRACC scheduler's approval. Submit names NET 45 calendar days and
  NLT 30 calendar days prior to CSD. AMC/A3TF will release the class roster 30 calendar
  days prior to CSD for units to confirm the names and make any necessary corrections.
  Unfilled quotas will be available 14 calendar days prior to CSD and units will be notified.
  AMC/A3TF will no longer accept any additions 72 hours/3 calendar days prior to CSD.
  Units can still cancel 24 hours prior to CSD to avoid a no-show being charged to the unit.
  Questions regarding GRACC scheduling can be referred to AMC/A3TF, DSN 779-7881.
  1.18.7. AMC/A3TF will maintain a standby list for each course offered. Send requests for
  additional quotas to AMC/A3TF for placement on the standby list. If unit capability is in
  jeopardy, AMC/A3TF will coordinate with Air Staff and AETC to add or reallocate
  additional quotas. AMC/A3TF quota managers will coordinate with the OSS training offices
  exclusively. Squadrons or individuals will be referred to their OSS training office. This
  policy is to ensure that all offices responsible for quota management are in sync with each
  other and prevents lost seats. Please submit the name/phone number/e-mail for the primary
  and alternate point of contact for quota management in the OSS.

                           INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General Requirements. AFI 11-202v1 defines initial qualification training. This chapter
specifies minimum training requirements for initial/mission qualification, re-qualification,
conversion training, and senior officer courses. The primary method of initial/mission
qualification is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course in the ETCA.
When a quota is not available, units will request a waiver to conduct in-unit qualification
training, using formal school courseware.
2.2. Initial Qualification Training Prerequisites: Complete initial qualification prerequisites
in accordance with the ETCA website, this publication, and the course syllabus.
2.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete ground training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202v1 and this instruction. During formal training,
aircrews may complete (and receive credit for) Aircrew-Specific Mobility Training events in
Table 4.2. See the appropriate formal training course syllabus.
   2.3.1. If events in Table 2.1 are not accomplished at the FTU, they must be completed at the
   gaining unit. The FTU will provide the gaining unit with documentation indicating non-
   completion of FTU items in Table 2.1 using standard ARMS Event Identifiers.
   2.3.2. Completion of Initial SERE Schools according to AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion,
   Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Operations, and initial Aircrew Flight Equipment training

Notes
1. Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until required training is accomplished
2. Not required for basic aircraft qualification crewmembers or Senior Officers
3. Completed during academic training with TS contractor
4. Flight Physical and Physiological Training are tracked on the top of each crewmember’s
Individual Training Summary (ITS). Therefore, there is no need to assign and track these
training events in the training module of ARMS
5. Re-accomplish upon arrival after each permanent change of station or MDS change
2.4. Flying Training Requirements. Complete flying training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with the formal school syllabus, AFI 11-202v1, and this instruction.
2.5. Conversion Training Requirements. If available, qualified personnel in other units will
provide the initial cadre. In some instances, it will be necessary for units to form an initial cadre
of crewmember personnel for whom certain qualification training requirements may be waived.
The following conditions will apply to the management of initial cadre crewmember
qualification:
 24                                    AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014


   2.5.1. MAJCOM, in coordination with lead and training command, will develop a training
   plan for unit conversions. The plan should include provisions to form a nucleus of
   crewmembers to include instructors and flight examiners (initial cadre). Converting units
   may request initial cadre waiver of PAI time requirement. Send waiver requests through
   MAJCOM training staff in the format in figure 1.1. In the request, include the most recent
   aircraft flown and total time in that aircraft in the remarks section of the waiver.
   2.5.2. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held (e.g.
   C-130 mission pilot (MP) to C-17 evaluator pilot (EP) unless previously qualified in the
   higher-level position in the conversion aircraft.
   2.5.3. After final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre of instructors and
   flight examiners by crew qualification.
2.6. Multiple Qualifications. Crewmembers will attend a formal initial qualification course for
multiple qualifications in different MDS aircraft (i.e., C-130 and C-17). Crewmembers will as a
minimum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in each aircraft (N/A for senior officers).
2.7. Senior Officer Qualification. AFI 11-202v1 (paragraph 2.7) identifies senior officer
qualification requirements. Senior Officer Course (SOC) graduates will follow Table 4.6 for
continuation training purposes and will not fly unsupervised in a primary crew position (see
paragraph 4.3.1.5).
   2.7.1. After qualification IAW AFI 11-202v1, and with OG/CC approval, senior officers
   (assigned or attached) may seek training which leads to a higher FTL and/or qualification.
   The unit OSS/OST office is responsible for determining training requirements based on the
   senior officer’s flying experience and familiarity with the weapons system. MAJCOM/A3T
   (or equivalent) will approve the proposed training plan prior to execution.
   2.7.2. Senior Officers that complete full qualification training requirements will maintain
   FTL A continuation training requirements.
2.8. Flight Surgeons. Flight Surgeons are allowed to fly locally as defined by OG/CC and log
time in their primary MDS while in training for initial (mission) qualification. See paragraph
3.5 for training requirements.
2.9. Requalification Training (RQT). An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of
the qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in
Chapter 4), or completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS (EXCEPTION: When
authorized multiple qualification). The duration of unqualified time is from the date the aircrew
member became unqualified until the specific retraining start date. For Active Duty Service
Commitments for aircrew training, see AFI 36-2107. See AFI 11-202v1 for additional
requalification training limits and requirements.
   2.9.1. RQT may be conducted at the formal school or in-unit following the appropriate
   syllabus (see course list in Chapter 6). Follow training event requirements in the appropriate
   re-qualification course syllabus except as noted in the waiver request.
   2.9.2. Requalification Training Courses. Unqualified crew members will complete the
   appropriate TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 courses outlined below.
       2.9.2.1. Pilot TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 Courses:

        2.9.2.1.1. TX-1. Unqualified C-17 pilots (over 8 Years) or cross flow aircraft
        commanders from other MDS aircraft will complete the Pilot Initial Qualification
        (PIQ) or Aircraft Commander Initial Qualification (ACIQ) formal school flying
        training course (TX-1) and a flight evaluation. An active duty or reserve service
        commitment is required.
        2.9.2.1.2. TX-2. Unqualified C-17 pilots (39 months at the end of a non-flying
        assignment or 51 months at the end of any active flying assignment to 8 Years) will
        complete the Aircraft Commander Requalification (ACRQ) or Instructor Pilot
        Requalification (IPRQ) formal school flying training course (TX-2) as appropriate
        and a flight evaluation. An active duty or reserve service commitment is required.
        2.9.2.1.3. TX-3. Unqualified C-17 pilots (up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying
        assignment or up to 51 months at the end of any active flying assignment) will
        complete the TS local Aircraft Commander, First Pilot, Pilot Requalification (PRQ)
        or Instructor Pilot Requalification (TX-3) course in-unit and a flight evaluation.
        (Note: A waiver is not required for this in-unit requalification).
           2.9.2.1.3.1. Squadron Commanders may tailor or expand the TX-3 course based
           on individual proficiency and experience.
               2.9.2.1.3.1.1. As a minimum, unqualified pilots will complete training in all
               delinquent items (Note: This may include current phase continuation training),
               additional training as directed by the squadron commander, and a flight
               evaluation.
     2.9.2.2. Loadmaster TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 Courses:
        2.9.2.2.1. TX-1. Unqualified C-17 loadmasters (Over 8 Years) or cross flow
        loadmasters from other MDS aircraft will complete Loadmaster Initial Qualification
        (LIQ) ETCA formal school flying training (TX-1/301) and a flight evaluation. An
        active duty or reserve service commitment is required.
        2.9.2.2.2. TX-2. Unqualified C-17 loadmasters (over 39 months at the end of a non-

                                           Chapter 3

            MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for
mission qualification and certification training. All crewmembers will complete initial
qualification followed by mission certification training (MCT). Except where specifically stated,
units conducting MCT may arrange mission sequence or sequence training events as necessary to
use flying training hours to effectively accomplish the unit mission. Crewmembers in MCT may
participate in exercises (see paragraph 1.6.2).
3.2. Time Periods for Mission Certification Training. See Table 1.2 for training time
limitations. A crewmember will be mission ready (MR) after completion of all ground training
and flying training requirements, review and certification by SQ/CC, or Review and Certification
(R&C) Board for aircraft commander (AC), according to AFI 11-2C-17v2.
   3.2.1. Aircraft Commander Initial Qual (ACIQ) Graduates. Upon completion of all
   requirements from Table 2.1 and Table 3.1, an ACIQ graduate will be counted as a mission
   qualified pilot (FPQ) only for Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) and
   Training Review Panel (TRP) purposes. ACIQ graduates may fly as an FPL on any crew
   including operational missions. ACIQ graduates are not MR ACs and may not fly as A-code
   pilot-in-command until certified by the SQ/CC or R&C Board. The maximum time period
   for pilots completing the aircraft commander initial qualification course to be certified as an
   aircraft commander is 180 calendar days (240 for AFRC and NGB).
   3.2.2. Pilot Initial Qual (PIQ) Graduates. Upon completion of all ground and flying training
   requirements from Table 2.1 and Table 3.1, a PIQ graduate will be counted as a mission
   ready pilot for SORTS and TRP purposes and may fly as a FPC/FPQ (depending on MPD
   Phase) on any crew including operational missions. PIQ graduates are not MR ACs and may
   not fly as an A-code pilot-in-command until completion of the Pilot Checkout (PCO)
   program and certified by the SQ/CC or R&C Board.
   3.2.3. Aircraft Commander Qualification (ACQ), PCO, and Requalification Graduates.
   Maximum time period for pilots completing the ACQ/PCO/requalification course to be
   certified as an aircraft commander is 120 day (240 for AFRC and NGB).
   3.2.4. Loadmaster Initial Qual (LIQ) and Requalification Graduates. The maximum time
   period for loadmasters to complete the local orientation flight and mission qualification
   training is within 90 calendar days of the first significant training event upon entering
   Mission Qualification/requalification training. EXCEPTION: First term airmen awaiting the
   First Term Airman’s Center (FTAC) course may accomplish ground training, phase training,
   and local orientation flights to maintain knowledge and skills learned during initial
   qualification training prior to the 90-day time period. If mission qualification training is
   started prior to FTAC, the 90-day time period begins upon completion of FTAC. Document
   the FTAC course dates in TMS.
   3.2.5. ARMS Tracking
       3.2.5.1. See Table 5.2 for pilot designation codes.
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                  27


       3.2.5.2. Loadmaster initial qualification graduates will be coded “FL” for ARMS
       tracking and SORTS reporting purposes until mission ready (this does not affect the
       “ML” qualification listed on the AF Form 8).
3.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete all syllabus and ground training events in
Table 2.1. and Table 3.1. before mission ready certification. Training may be accomplished
concurrently with other training.

Table 3.1. Mission Certification Ground Training Requirements.

Notes:
1. Re-accomplish upon arrival after each permanent change of station or MDS change.
2. Ensure crewmember is current and/or initial clearance received prior to first flight.
3. Reference AFI 16-1301 for details.
4. See AFPD 11-3, AFI 11-301, AFOSH Standard 127-100 and applicable MAJCOM guidance.
5. Credit may be awarded if the event was accomplished at the formal school or during in-unit
upgrade.
3.4. Flying Training Requirements.
   3.4.1. BAQ crewmembers pursuing MR status will be assigned a Flight Training Level and
   accomplish continuation training requirements IAW Chapter 4. Continuation training
   requirements will be prorated based on the training time start date as defined in paragraph
   1.7.1. Crewmembers will credit events accomplished during MCT IAW paragraph 4.4.1.
   Crewmembers pursuing MR status who fail to accomplish minimum aircrew requirements
   (currency and semi-annual) must fly under supervision of an instructor when that event is
   required for a particular flight.
       3.4.1.1. Crewmembers in MCT who fail to accomplish all semi-annual training
       requirements must complete training IAW paragraph 4.10.7 prior to awarding MR status.
       On a case-by-case basis, the SQ/CC may review the crewmember's training accomplished
       and waive incomplete requirements as required. (Document the waiver in TMS).
       Crewmembers non-current for an event may be certified MR on a case-by-case basis, but
       the crewmember will remain NMR for that event and will be supervised on any flight
       requiring that event IAW paragraph 4.10.2.2. After arrival at duty station, all
       crewmembers will receive a local area briefing and a local orientation/mission ready
 28                                     AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014


       (MR) flight. For pilots, the MR flight may be substituted by a simulator sortie focused on
       events specific to the unit’s mission. If a simulator is used for the MR sortie, the local
       orientation flight remains a separate requirement (not applicable for in-unit, re-
       qualification or upgrade training). The lack of a local briefing and local flight does not
       preclude the crewmember from flying as MR.
       3.4.1.2. Loadmasters. Newly qualified C-17 airdrop loadmasters’ first personnel airdrop
       mission will be flown under the supervision of an instructor loadmaster. The instructor
       will document the completion of training on the initial airdrop qualification AF Form 8 to
       clear the personnel airdrop restriction. Loadmasters should complete personnel airdrop
       training by the end of the semi-annual period in which the initial airdrop qualification
       was completed. For students that graduate near the end of the semi-annual period,
       Squadron/CCs may extend the training time limit by 60 calendar days with
       documentation in TMS.
           3.4.1.2.1. Loadmasters that do not complete personnel airdrop training by the end of
           the semi-annual period are non-current for personnel airdrop. Loadmasters non-
           current in excess of 6 months are unqualified in personnel airdrop.
3.5. Flight Surgeon Mission Qualification Requirements. Before deploying or acting as
aircrew in any aircraft other than their primary aircraft, flight surgeons must fly at least two
sorties in their primary aircraft, complete all required ground training events listed in Table 4.3
(for the primary aircraft), and accomplish flight surgeon testing on the AFDL website. NOTE:
Initial Qualification requirements only apply to the Flight Surgeon's primary aircraft.
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                      29


                                           Chapter 4

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training
requirements to maintain currency. The unit commander will ensure each crewmember receives
sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.
4.2. Aircrew Status. C-17 crewmembers are assigned to MR, NMR, BMC, or BAQ status.
   4.2.1. Mission Ready (MR). For SORTS reporting, operational tasking, and deployments, a
   MR crewmember is defined as an available, qualified crew member. Aircraft commander
   certification is a prerequisite to serving as a MR aircraft commander.
   4.2.2. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). A crewmember that is unqualified, non-current or
   incomplete in required continuation training. See paragraph 4.10 for specific guidance on
   crewmembers who are non-current.
   4.2.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A NMR crewmember assigned to MAJCOM
   headquarters, NAF, EMTF, 618 TACC, USAF EC, CRG, AMOG, FTU, WIC, or direct
   reporting unit who has satisfactorily completed mission qualification training and does not
   maintain MR status, but maintains familiarization in the command or unit’s operational
   mission.
       4.2.3.1. The crewmember may maintain certification in some aspects of the unit mission
       and is able to attain full qualification in the unit mission within 45 calendar days.
       4.2.3.2. FTU BMC crewmembers are certified to conduct all aspects of the AETC
       training mission. AETC instructors must be certified in the training/unit mission before
       performing instructor duties. AETC crewmembers may fly CONUS (includes Alaska
       and Hawaii) and Caribbean 618 TACC-directed missions, but will comply with MR
       requirements to fly all other 618 TACC-directed missions.
       4.2.3.3. BMC crewmembers may log instructor or evaluator time for the portion of the
       mission for which they are current and qualified.
   4.2.4. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). A crewmember that has satisfactorily completed
   initial qualification training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.
   4.2.5. MR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers must accomplish and/or maintain the
   requirements in AFI 11-202v1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the
   ground and semi-annual flying continuation tables.
4.3. Flying Training Levels.
   4.3.1. The SQ/CC determines the flight training level (FTL) before the start of each semi-
   annual period. Assign new unit crewmembers a FTL during in-processing. Base FTL on
   experience and aircraft proficiency. Crewmembers may have a different FTL for different
   flying qualifications (i.e. a crewmember may be a FTL A airland aircraft commander, but a
   FTL C airdrop copilot).
       4.3.1.1. FTL A - Highly Experienced Crewmembers (including BAQ highly experienced
       crewmembers pursuing MR status). This may include MR or NMR MAJCOM
 30                                   AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014


      headquarters, 618 TACC personnel, AETC instructors, NAF personnel, USAF EC
      instructors, WIC instructors and WIC students, Wing, OG, and SQ/CCs, operations
      officers, personnel assigned to OG evaluation positions, and any instructors assigned
      primarily to staff duties. Note: NMR crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM staff, 618
      TACC, USAF EC, TALCE, AMOG, FTU, or direct reporting unit may be categorized as
      BMC and assigned to FTL A and may fly unsupervised on local training missions
      provided they are current and qualified for that mission.
      4.3.1.2. FTL B - Experienced MR Crewmember (including BAQ highly experienced
      crewmembers pursuing MR status).
      4.3.1.3. FTL C - MR Crewmember. Initially assign inexperienced MR crewmembers to
      FTL C and inexperienced individuals pursuing MR status after initial qualification
      training. This training level may also be assigned to flight test, WIC cadre, and other
      staff crew members.
      4.3.1.4. FTL E - BAQ or BMC non-instructor staff. FTL E may include senior officers,
      MAJCOM, NAF, and 618 TACC staff who are not maintaining MR or instructor status.
      FTL E requirements are insufficient for MR status and crewmembers assigned to this
      FTL will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times.
   4.3.2. Change of FTL. Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a crewmember to a
   level requiring fewer events. (Exception: Units associating FTLs with crew positions may
   change FTLs after upgrade i.e. instructor upgrade). Place BAQ crewmembers into a different
   FTL any time after attaining MR status. Prorate events upon changing training levels.
4.4. Training Events/Tables. Standardized ARMS training event identifiers and descriptions
are listed in Chapter 7.
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment.          Credit events accomplished on training,
   operational missions, and satisfactory evaluations toward currency requirements and
   establish a subsequent due date. For FTU and local upgrade qualification courses, only log
   events that were completed on a successful evaluation. EXCEPTION: Any event that the
   crew member is already qualified to perform may be credited (i.e. takeoffs and landings
   during upgrade training sorties). Airland events during upgrade sorties for airdrop
   qualifications (i.e. CAD, ACAD, LAD) may be logged on any sortie, but airdrop events may
   only be logged during a successful airdrop evaluation.
      4.4.1.1. Checkride date will establish currency for events (Table 4.4 and Table 4.5)
      accomplished during upgrade/requalification training. Volume credit will only be given
      to events accomplished on a successful evaluation. Events accomplished during
      upgrade/requalification training, but not accomplished on a checkride will be input into
      ARMS with a volume accomplished of “0” effective the date of the checkride.
      4.4.1.2. Members overdue Q/I Eval may not log any flying continuation events until
      successful completion of Q/I Eval. Members overdue MSN Eval may continue to log
      only those flying continuation events required on a Q/I evaluation.
   4.4.2. For an unsatisfactory flight evaluation, do not log continuation training requirements
   for those qualifications graded Q-3 until re-qualified.
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                      31


   4.4.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
   EXCEPTION: Not applicable to phase training CBTs.
   4.4.4. Instructor training requirements and responsibilities. Instructors and flight examiners
   may credit 50 percent of their total requirements while instructing or evaluating.
   EXCEPTION: Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any takeoffs, landings, or
   air refueling flown by another pilot.
   4.4.5. FTU OG/CCs and the Commandant USAFWS may seek, obtain MAJCOM approval,
   and publish ground and flying continuation training requirements in local training
   procedures.
   4.4.6. Documenting Aircrew Training Events.
      4.4.6.1. All training events will be recorded in ARMS.
          4.4.6.1.1. Training events conducted during block training or phase training may be
          consolidated under one ARMS entry.
          4.4.6.1.2. Combined training events may have only one ARMS entry.
          4.4.6.1.3. Input all one-time events and events required for permanent change-of-
          station (PCS) in the ARMS database.
4.5. Continuation Training Requirements.
   4.5.1. Completion and tracking of continuation training is the responsibility of the individual
   crewmember. Crewmembers must actively work with unit schedulers and training offices to
   ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described in this chapter.
   4.5.2. Ground Training Events. Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Table 4.1,
   and Table 4.2.
      4.5.2.1. Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 leads to non-mission ready status. See
      paragraph 4.10 for regaining mission ready status.
      4.5.2.2. Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.2 does not lead to
      non-mission ready status but may restrict member from certain missions.
      4.5.2.3. Crewmembers (i.e., NAF, MAJCOM, etc.) attached to units may accomplish
      ground training events at locations other than their unit of attachment. The crewmember
      is responsible for reporting accomplished training events to their unit of attachment
      (ARMS office).
      4.5.2.4. Crewmembers performing extended alert duty (more than 72 hours) may
      accomplish ground training that does not degrade required response time or mission
      accomplishment. Specify requirements and or restrictions in the MAJCOM supplement
      and/or the unit supplement.
      4.5.2.4. (452AMW) Extended alert duty does not routinely apply to the 729 AS.
      4.5.2.5. Flight Surgeons use requirements in Table 4.3.

 3. Dual log with airland phase CBTs.
 4. The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority for this event.
 5. OG/CCs may specify an alternate frequency for Tactics training, but not less than “annual”.
 6. This event does not satisfy the IRC examination requirement within the check cycle.
 7. AFI 11-2(MDS)v1 is not the governing directive for completion of this event. IAW AFI
 11-202 Volume 1, Paragraph 6, refer to HQ USAF/A3OT reference publications for current
 ancillary training frequencies.
 8. This event is independently tracked via the crewmember’s Individual Training Summary
 (ITS) and thus does not require an ARMS code.
 9. LL06 may be accomplished in conjunction with SS02, LL03, or SS05. See Chapter 7.
 10. Local sorties/CONUS Training Missions may be accomplished unsupervised while non-
 current for this event.
 11. Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until required training is accomplished.
 Flight physicals become due 366 calendar days after the previous physical, and expire after the
 455th day or as indicated on the AF IMT 1042, whichever occurs first. The required
 frequency may vary to address waivers and/or individual physical limitations (as determined
 by the AMDC/CC), but in no case will exceed 455 calendar days.
 12. Phase CBTs must be accomplished prior to the current period’s Phase WST training
 (AFRC and NGB crewmembers should accomplish Phase CBTs prior to Phase WST training,
 but the sortie will not be canceled if not accomplished).
 13. Applies only to AETC FTU instructors non-current in SS02.

                                                            Directive
        (CSI)
See “Frequency” in Attachment 1
Notes:
1. Mandatory grounding item.
2. Flight Surgeons without an aviation unit mobility requirement (e.g. non-operational staff or
leadership role in Aerospace Medicine, and Flight Surgeons undergoing training in the USAF
Residency in Aerospace Medicine) do not need to accomplish this training.
3. The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority for this event. See paragraph 4.10.7.
4. Accomplish upon arrival after each permanent change of station or change in MDS.
5. Flight physicals become due 366 calendar days after the previous physical, and expire after
the 455th day or as indicated on the AF IMT 1042, whichever occurs first. The required
frequency may vary to address waivers and/or individual physical limitations (as determined by
AMDS/CC), but in no case will exceed 455 calendar days.
6. AFI 11-2C-17 Volume 1 is not the governing directive for completion of this event. IAW AFI
11-202 Volume 1, Paragraph 6, refer to HQ USAF/A3O-AT reference publications for current
ancillary training frequencies. See event description in Chapter 7 for additional information.
7. S-V80-A establishes initial training completion date for SS02, SS03 and SS20.
8. Flight surgeons must fly at least 50 percent of their annual minimum requirements in primary
unit aircraft unless deployed away from their primary unit for more than 90 calandar days.
9. Flight surgeons may log more than one sortie per day; however, no more than one sortie per
single calendar day will be credited towards semi-annual and annual sortie requirements.
10. A night sortie is one on which either takeoff or landing and at least 50 percent of flight
duration or one hour, whichever is less, occurs during night time, as defined in AFI 11-401.
11. FF12 may be dual logged with FF11 if any provisions in note 10 are met.
   4.5.3. Flying Continuation Training Requirements. Table 4.4 and Table 4.5 list mobility-
   wide, standardized flying continuation training event requirements. See Chapter 7 for event
   descriptions.
       4.5.3.1. Dual-Seat Qualification. (See para 5.2, for detailed guidance)
           4.5.3.1.1. PIQ Graduates. Pilots (FPQ) are dual seat qualified, and may accomplish
           training events in either seat. PIQ graduates are qualified to:
              4.5.3.1.1.1. Fly and land in the left or right seat, accomplish full-flap, full-stop
              landings to long runways (greater than 5,000 ft).
              4.5.3.1.1.2. Perform NVG takeoff and landing pilot-flying duties from either seat.
              4.5.3.1.1.3. PIQ graduates may perform pilot flying (PF) duties during assault

            landings under IP supervision from either seat with no passengers on board.
            4.5.3.1.1.4. PIQ graduates may only attempt air refueling under IP supervision
            with no passengers on board after the required on-load is achieved.
        4.5.3.1.2. Aircraft Commanders. Aircraft Commanders (MP), PCO graduates (FPL),
        and ACIQ graduates (FPL) will only accomplish air refueling and ALZ landings from
        the left seat unless under direct IP supervision or SQ/CC certified (see Chapter 5).
        4.5.3.1.3. IPs may fly and supervise any student in either seat.
     4.5.3.2. ATD Credit for Training Requirements. Flight events creditable in the ATD are
     listed in Table 4.4 and Table 4.5. For ARMS tracking, simulator events will be logged
     with an “S” prefixed task ID in ARMS. All simulator accomplishments must be
     documented and tracked in ARMS. Ensure the maximum number of simulator creditable
     events is not exceeded.
        4.5.3.2.1. The definition of 50% creditable in the WST is that at least 50% of the
        semi-annual volume requirements must be accomplished in the aircraft, and it is not
        intended to limit accomplishment in the WST once the 50% in the A/C has been
        satisfied. If proration reduces 50% WST creditable event volume to 1, that event must
        be accomplished in the aircraft.
     4.5.3.3. Continuation Training Flying. Each MAJCOM provides flying hours to each
     wing as training, test, and ferry hours or operations and maintenance (O and M) hours.
     The hours, based on FTL C, are designed to provide all crew positions with sufficient
     hours to accomplish all continuation flying training requirements.
     4.5.3.4. Airdrop Proficiency and Currency Requirements. Pilots may take credit
     concurrently for an airdrop, provided they are performing their respective crew position
     duties. Loadmasters may take credit after slowdown checklist is complete provided the
     no-drop was not due to loadmaster error.
     4.5.3.5. Mission profile simulators (G250, G260-G264, G266-G269 and G294) will be
     flown in the same manner as the aircraft, to include the wear and use of professional gear
     (headsets, helmets, etc.).
        4.5.3.5.1. Simulator sorties will be scheduled as ground events in GDSS if able (NA
        for AFRC, NGB and AETC) and sortie cancellation authority will reside with the
        OG/CC (or designated representative).
        4.5.3.5.2. Pre-requisites for simulator training must be completed prior to the sim
        start time or the training will be cancelled. AFRC and NGB members should
        complete phase CBTs prior to phase simulator training, but simulator sortie will not
        be canceled if CBTs are not complete.
     4.5.3.6. Crewmembers assigned to units north of the 60-degree parallel will handle night
     (not NVG events) currency as follows: Day events/sorties update night event/sorties from
     1 April to 30 September. OG/CCs will determine crewmembers night currency status
     after 30 September.

Notes:
1. Non-current loadmasters up to six months regain currency by demonstrating proficiency to
the satisfaction of an instructor loadmaster. Non-current loadmasters in excess of six months
are unqualified and require SQ/CC directed re-qualification training and an evaluation.
IL/EL may log the event while performing instructor or evaluator duties. MAJCOM and NAF
Staff loadmasters require one proficiency sortie every 90 calendar days. Reference paragraph
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                        45


4.10.6.2.
2. PNAF qualified crew members only.
3. MAJCOM, NAF, DET 2, AMCAOS, C-17 WIC, 97 AMW, and flight test loadmasters
require one annually. This requirement will not be waived.
4. Do not use the simulator to maintain or regain currency during two consecutive periods
(i.e. if the simulator is used to regain currency, actual Dual Row Airdrop (DRA) must be
accomplished in the aircraft during the next period).
5. Only for select crew members maintaining Dual Row Airdrop flying currency in
accordance with unit DOC statements. To receive credit for the event, one drop must be from
the LM1 position and one from the LM2 position.
6. Non-current airdrop loadmasters up to six months regain currency in this event by
demonstrating proficiency to the satisfaction of an instructor loadmaster. Non-current airdrop
loadmasters in excess of six months are unqualified in this event and require SQ/CC directed
re-qualification training and an evaluation. Loss of qualification in a single airdrop event
does not lead to loss of qualification in all airdrop events.
7. IL/EL must drop at least one actual for currency and may log second (if needed) while
performing instructor or evaluator duties.
8. Not required for FTU and WIC loadmasters
9. Semi-annual for AFRC and NGB
10. JPADS qualified crewmembers only.
4.6. Flight Surgeon Continuation Flying Requirements. Flight Surgeons will comply with
the requirements of this volume and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Flight surgeons require one sortie in
any qualified MDS every 60 calendar days. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1 table for flying
continuation-training requirements. See paragraph 4.10.6 for regaining mission ready status.
   4.6.1. Any flight surgeon logging time in this MDS as a secondary airframe, or any AMC-
   assigned flight surgeon logging time in any DoD or foreign military aircraft in which they are
   granted authorization to fly by the local unit, must be on Aeronautical Orders assigning ASC
   8A status and be current in their periodic flight physical and physiological training. The AC
   or their designated crewmember must also give FS a briefing on oxygen equipment and
   egress procedures prior to flight.
       4.6.1.1. For contingency/AOR missions, Flight Surgeons must also be current in the
       following events (in their primary aircraft): SS02, SS03, SS20 (or S-V80-A), and G120.
   4.6.2. Flight Surgeon loss of flying currency.
       4.6.2.1. Units will notify the MAJCOM Command Surgeon of attached Flight Surgeons
       exceeding 60-calendar days between sorties (AMC units send notification to HQ
       AMC/SGP and local MDG/CC). Flight surgeons that exceed 60 calendar days between
       sorties require a review of aircraft exits and oxygen systems conducted by a member of
       the flight crew designated by the Aircraft Commander (AC) prior to the flight to regain
       flying currency.
       4.6.2.2. The egress review will be signed off by the AC on a copy of the AMC/SGP
       memo or other approved form (e.g., AF 1522, locally generated form/memo, etc.) Note:
       documentation on AFTO 781 is not acceptable. The Flight surgeon must submit this
       documentation to the local Squadron/Host Aviation Resource Manager (SARM/HARM)
       office after the flight or upon return to home station if the flight is in conjunction with a
 46                                     AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014


         TDY. The HARM or SARM will place the documentation in the flight surgeon’s training
         folder.
         4.6.2.3. Failure to complete and document required training before the flight will result
         in the loss of ability to log primary flight surgeon time.
         4.6.2.4. Flight Surgeons that exceed 6-months between sorties require completion of
         LL03, Emergency Egress Training, Non-Ejection Seat, with a certified aircrew instructor
         prior to the next flight.
4.7. Senior Officer Continuation Flying Requirements.
   4.7.1. Senior Officers that complete full qualification training requirements will maintain
   continuation training requirements for the appropriate crew position; otherwise, Senior
   Officers will complete training requirements in Table 4.6.
   4.7.2. SOQ pilots are not required to complete Phase CBTs or Phase Simulators, but are
   allowed and encouraged to complete them.
   4.7.3. SOQ pilots must fly under the direct supervision of an instructor pilot at all times.
   The instructor must consider prior SOQ experience, recent flight experience and proficiency
   and use sound judgment and ORM principles when determining which maneuvers the SOQ
   will be allowed to perform. SOQ pilots may perform NVG duties (PF or PM) only if
   qualified on NVGs.

         Notes:
         1. Mandatory grounding event after expiration date.
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                      47


       2. May qualify for 'academics only' or Executive Refresher Course. See AFI11-403
       for details.
       3. This event does not satisfy the IRC examination requirement within the check
       cycle.
       4. Member will go unqualified if non-current in this event for greater than 6 months.
       5. Only required if qualified in NVGs and/or RNAV.
       6. May perform PF duties only on training missions w/o passengers, limited to PM
       duties with passengers.
       7. May accomplish 100% in the WST.
       8. Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until required training is
       accomplished. Flight physicals become due 366 calendar days after the previous
       physical, and expire after the 455th day or as indicated on the AF IMT 1042,
       whichever occurs first. The required frequency may vary to address waivers and/or
       individual physical limitations (as determined by the Flight Surgeon), but in no case
       will exceed 455 calendar days.

4.8. Ancillary Training. Guidance or instruction that contributes to mission accomplishment,
but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. AFI 11-2C-17v1 is not the
governing directive for completion of ancillary training events. In accordance with AFI 11-
202v1, the source AFI provides training frequency for these events unless an approved waiver
has been authorized. See Unit Deployment Manger representative to ensure compliance with
additional non-aircrew specific training requirements. Accomplish Ancillary and Expeditionary
Skills Training in accordance with AFI 36-2201 v1. Except for FTU instructors, C-17 aircrew
members fulfill the Enabler Role and will maintain Mission Ready Status for a Major
Contingency Operation (MCO). Air and Space Expeditionary Forces, AEF online can be
accessed at: https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/mandatory_exped_trning.aspx
4.9. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202v1 describes proration of training requirements for
crewmembers not available for flying duties. Additionally, prorate training for non-availability
due to contingency alerts and contingency flying TDYs when the contingency precludes training
for certain mission events (PACAF: also contingency operations from home station). This
authority must be used judiciously, especially when prorating the same crewmember for
consecutive semi-annual training periods.
   4.9.1. Pilots and LMs will accomplish remaining events depending on the number of months
   remaining in the quarter in which they graduated from initial school or upon completion of
   requalification training. Members who attended CPAD during the semi-annual period may
   subtract the time spent away from the unit to prorate airland events. Newly certified Aircraft
   Commanders may use their PCO graduation date to prorate remaining events. All volume
   training requirements should be prorated based on instructions in Table 4.7.
       4.9.1.1. Two months remaining:
           4.9.1.1.1. Pilots: Accomplish one instrument simulator sortie (ISS) and one basic
           tactical sortie (BTS) or instructor tactical sortie (ITS).
           4.9.1.1.2. Loadmasters: Accomplish one Proficiency Sortie (PS).
       4.9.1.2. One month remaining:
 48                                    AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014


          4.9.1.2.1. Pilots: Accomplish one ISS and one BTS or ITS.
          4.9.1.2.2. Loadmasters: No requirement.
       4.9.1.3. Crewmembers enrolled in PCO, IAC, CPAD, ACAD, LAD and ILM are not
       exempt from quarterly phase training. Crewmembers enrolled in initial or requalification
       courses at the formal training unit or approved in-unit requalification training are exempt
       from quarterly phase training simulator requirements (based on projected graduation
       dates). Phase training CBT lessons must still be completed.
          4.9.1.3.1. CPAD and LAD graduates. All airdrop volume training requirements
          should be prorated based on instructions in Table 4.7.
       4.9.1.4. Phase Training. Phase training for MP/IP may be accomplished with any crew
       qualification. Phase Training for FPs will be accomplished with an MP/IP. Only SQ/CC
       or DO may waive this requirement with proper reasoning and documentation in TMS.
       For newly qualified crewmembers (PIQ, ACIQ, LIQ and newly REQUALIFIED
       graduates), phase currency (for simulator and CBT lessons) begins during the next
       currency period.
       4.9.1.5. Phase CBTs are a grounding event. Annual written examinations are
       incorporated in phase training CBTs. Failure to complete required phase CBT results in
       annual written examinations being incomplete. Missed Phase CBTs must be completed
       prior to accomplishing any phase training for the current quarter.
   4.9.2. Use this formula to determine training requirements for individuals available for
   flying duties for 16 calendar days or more: number of months available times the event
   volume divided by the number of months in the training period. Round down to the nearest
   whole number, but not less than 1 (e.g. 5.6 rounds to 5). Proration does not apply to
   crewmembers available for flying duties for 15 calendar days or less.
       4.9.2.1. Use Table 4.7 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if
       absence is at least 15 cumulative calendar days and only prorate the minimal number of
       individual events required to satisfy semi-annual requirements. For Example: Number
       of events required = 8, member accomplished 6, member was available 80 calendar days.
       Although table allows proration of 4 events, only prorate the number deficient (2).
       4.9.2.2. When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) during the training cycle
       to a unit flying the same model aircraft and enters the same FTL or lower, credit training
       accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time
       available (e.g., time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of calendar
       daysnot available) during the training period. Time available starts 7-calendar days after
       sign-in for CONUS and 14-calendar days after sign-in for OCONUS or on the date of
       actual accomplishment of the first training event, whichever occurs first. Subtract
       previous accomplishments from the prorated total to determine remaining requirements.
   4.9.3. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels.         If
   requirements are prorated do not credit events accomplished while in the former FTL.

4.10. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Declare individuals NMR if they fail to
maintain flying currency, fail to complete semi-annual flying continuation training requirements,
or fail to complete ground continuation training requirements. This does not pertain to
individuals pursuing MR status after initial qualification or requalification training. The
following guidance applies:
   4.10.1. Crewmembers are non-current the day after event currency expires; (i.e., a
   crewmember that accomplished an event with monthly currency on 1 September becomes
   non-current on 1 November).
   4.10.2. If a crewmember is NMR for failure to complete required continuation training, the
   OG/CC has two options to keep MR status:
         4.10.2.1. Waive the required training. The individual remains on MR status.
         4.10.2.2. Place the crewmember in supervised status for that event (individual flies with
         an instructor of like specialty) until required training is accomplished. The crewmember
         cannot deploy until currency is regained. See Table 4.8 for exceptions.
   4.10.3. Crewmembers NMR for Airland flying events may fly unsupervised, until currency
   on delinquent item(s) is regained, on CONUS and OCONUS missions on which events in the
   delinquent category are not accomplished (OG/CC approval not required for local, routine,
   and non-contingency missions). Note: An individual non-current in phase sims (G261-264
   and G266-269), instrument simulator sortie (G294), takeoffs (P020), landings (P190), night
   landings (P192) instrument approaches (P070, P100, P110), or proficiency sortie (M010) will
   not fly unsupervised on any sortie (see paragraph 1.10).
   4.10.4. Pre-Deployment.      OG/CCs may modify the mission scenario and content of
   loadmaster Phase simulator training and day two pilot Phase simulator training immediately
   preceding the deployment for preparation. To ensure TS contractual compliance,
   coordination with AMC/A3TA is required at least one month prior to training
   implementation. After approval from AMC/A3TA, OG/CCs will ensure the modified
   mission scenario is coordinated with the TS Contractor Officers Representative (COR) and
   TS site manager at least three weeks prior to training implementation. Locally developed
   scenario will accomplish contractually agreed upon and TS-stated objectives.

  4.10.5. Deployment. For deployments of 45 calendar days or greater, aircraft commanders
  and pilots will adhere to the following guidance for the duration of that deployment to
  include positioning and depositioning legs:
     4.10.5.1. Air refueling currency for FTL C aircraft commanders is extended to 60
     calendar days.
     4.10.5.2. Aircraft commanders not current for air refueling may fly in command on any
     mission not requiring air refueling.
     4.10.5.3. Aircraft commanders not current for assault landings may fly in command on
     any mission not requiring assault landings.
     4.10.5.4. Pilots not current for NVG Assault landings are not restricted from other NVG
     events.
     4.10.5.5. Pilots (FPQ) not current for assault landings may fly on any missions not
     requiring assault landings.
     4.10.5.6. One of the two semi-annual ITS requirements for aircraft commanders may be
     substituted with a BTS for EAS deployed crewmembers.
     4.10.5.7. Reconstitution. OG/CCs will direct training requirements for crewmembers
     whose Phase training was missed during deployment.
  4.10.6. Regaining Currency.
     4.10.6.1. For a loss of currency up to 6 months, a crewmember must demonstrate
     proficiency in the aircraft or simulator (as appropriate as defined in Table 4.4 or Table
     4.5) with an Air Force instructor (or TS instructor for simulator creditable events) in all
     delinquent items. Crewmembers non-current for up to 6 months will maintain their
     current training level (no TMS documentation required). Accomplish missed phase sims
     as directed by SQ/CC. Accomplish CBTs for each missed quarter up to one year.
     4.10.6.2. Loss of currency exceeding 6 months for events identified in Table 4.4 (Note
     5) or Table 4.5 (Note 1) as leading to unqualified status, results in the crewmember being
     unqualified in the aircraft. They must complete SQ/CC-directed requalification training
     per para 2.9 and an aircrew evaluation according to AFI 11-2C-17v2, C-17 Aircrew
     Evaluation Criteria. SQ/CC directed training and evaluation will include all delinquent
     item(s) in training. Upon successful completion of the evaluation the crewmember’s
     currency will be established IAW 4.4.1.1. For example, with proper TMS documentation
     showing SQ/CC-directed training of a 6-month delinquent Landing LZ Nt, followed by a
     RQ MSN Eval accomplished during the day results in: Member regains full qualification
     and currency upon successful completion of flight evaluation for all events accomplished
     during requalification.
  4.10.7. Failure to Complete Semi-annual Flying Training Events. The OG/CC or equivalent
  may waive flying continuation training and currency events. At the end of each training
  period, the squadron commander will review ARMS products for those crewmembers who
  failed to accomplish all required flying training events (includes all events listed in the flying
  continuation training tables, Table 4.4 and Table 4.5.). The squadron commander will either
  direct training necessary for the individual to regain MR status or request OG/CC waiver. If
  the ARMS review shows enough flying events were recently accomplished to ensure MR
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                        51


   proficiency, OG/CC or equivalent may waive the requirements. This waiver authority must
   be used judiciously. The intent is to ensure crewmembers receive the proper quantity of
   flying events to remain proficient and allow OG/CC to determine MR status and additional
   training requirements when those training quotas are not met. Waivers for training or
   currency events missed in consecutive training periods require MAJCOM approval.
   4.10.8. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events. The OG/CC or equivalent may waive
   ground continuation training events identified in Table 4.1, Table 4.2, and Table 4.3. This
   waiver authority will be used judiciously. The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the
   individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency level (i.e. waivers will not be based on
   a crewmember’s availability). OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the
   waiver. The make-up training should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. This
   waiver is for unforeseen circumstances only and only for events that will not degrade mission
   accomplishment.
      4.10.8.1. With SQ/CC (or designated representative) approval, an individual NMR for
      failure to complete NVG Refresher Training (NV03) may fly unsupervised on missions
      not requiring the overdue event.
   4.10.9. Phase Training WST/LS Lesson Waivers. Make-up training is not required when
   phase training simulator lessons are waived. However, commanders may require completion
   of missed phase training based on individual proficiency and/or simulator availability.
   4.10.10. Noncurrency in the applicable categories of the ground and flying continuation
   training tables has the following consequences:

1. Includes all airland flying events listed in Tables 4.4 and 4.5 except for Secure Radio,
ISOPREP, and HAVE QUICK. See also paragraph 4.10.3.
2. This restriction applies only to the delinquent airdrop event for loss of currency up to six
months. (For example, pilots/loadmasters may perform container delivery system or heavy
equipment drops while non-current for personnel drops.)
3. Pilots non-current for NVG airdrop may still perform airland NVG events if current and
qualified.
4. Pilots non-current for Formation events may still perform airdrop events without an instructor
on sorties not requiring Formation. Non-currency in formation events does not affect airdrop
qualification.

                                           Chapter 5

                                    UPGRADE TRAINING

5.1. Description. This chapter identifies general prerequisites and training requirements for
upgrade. See minimum flying-hour requirements and prerequisites in Table 5.1.
     5.1.1. General. The flying time prerequisites for upgrade are based on the pilot or
     loadmaster having gained the knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish
     the unit’s missions. SQ/CCs will ensure their crewmember development programs
     emphasize these areas. Flying experience must include left seat time before entering formal
     school upgrade training. Crewmembers will have an in-depth knowledge of systems,
     procedures, and instructions before entering the formal upgrade program.
     5.1.2. OG/CC is designated waiver authority for flying hour prerequisites for entry into
     formal upgrade courses (see Table 5.1).

Notes:
1. Prior qualified pilots will have 100 total C-17 hours prior to certification (includes formal
school time but does not include “other” or simulator time).
2. Instructor candidates should have an 1A251 primary AFSC (or higher); 1A271 is desired.
3. Previously qualified instructors may upgrade in-unit without re-accomplishing the formal
AETC instructor course with OG/CC approval. MAJCOM waivers are not required. Document
the OG/CC approval and training in TMS.
4. OG/CC is the approval authority for non-squadron commander certified ACs to attend ACAD.
5. Total flying hours represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a “military”
pilot including UPT, Student, and “Other” time (but does not include time in another aircrew
specialty). Simulator time is credible to meet total flying hour requirement.
6. C-17 simulator time does count towards PAA. Do not count “Other” time towards PAA time.
7. For MAF crossflow with similar skill set (i.e., C-130, C-5, etc.), use TX1; MPD Phase II
guide is not required. Pilots with dissimilar background (i.e., OSA/FAIP, F-16, etc.), use TX1;
accomplish MPD Phase II in-unit. Only the OME is required for Phase III.
5.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). Mobility Pilot Development is the development
program leading to Aircraft Commander certification. The MPD program flows from Pilot
Initial Qualification (PIQ) or Aircraft Commander Initial Qualification (ACIQ) formal training
courses through continuation training to upgrade selection and culminates in certification as an
Aircraft Commander. MPD continuation training is divided into three phases: MPD Phase I
(V280), MPD Phase II (V281), and MPD Phase III. All MPD pilots will be dual-seat qualified
and maintain qualification requirements according to AFI 11-2C-17 Volume 2. MPD pilots are
not Aircraft Commanders. See minimum flying hour requirements in Table 5.1.
   5.2.1. The success of this program depends on MPD pilots being mentored and provided
   with development opportunities. The upgrade training timeline to Aircraft Commander is
   based on performance and at the discretion of the SQ/CC, should be tailored to match an
   individual’s capabilities and experience level.
5.3. MPD Continuation Training thru Aircraft Commander Certification.
   5.3.1. Documentation. Completion of MPD Phase I and II is documented in ARMS as V280
   and V281 respectively; GRACC is documented in ARMS as V282. Document the
   completion of the entire course via AF Form 4324 and SQ/CC certification.
   5.3.2. Training Guides. MPD Phase I & II guides are available for download on the
   AMC/A3T CoP. Guides should be carried on all sorties to maximize training opportunities.
   5.3.3. MPD Phase I (V280). Not required for ACIQ graduates. After completion of the PIQ
   course, pilots enter Phase I of continuation training. This first phase consists of completing
   the MPD Phase I guide, which focuses on core aircraft abilities including communication,
   checklist discipline, systems knowledge, and basic mission planning. A Phase I MPD pilot
   should not have additional squadron duties nor be expected to act as an Aircraft Commander,
   yet they should observe and learn from their aircrew leadership.
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                     55


     5.3.3.1. During this stage of pilot development, a Phase I MPD pilot is restricted to the
     right seat and may only occupy the aircraft left seat with an IP. Phase I MPD pilots will
     train in the right seat during phase sims and may occupy the left or right seats for
     proficiency sims (and available proficiency time at the end of a refresher sim). Phase I
     MPD pilots will complete the MPD Phase I guide NLT 180 calendar days(365 calendar
     days for ARC) after becoming mission ready.
     5.3.3.2. In order to advance beyond Phase I, the Phase I MPD pilot must be at least 6
     months from the training start date (as defined in 1.7.1), have a minimum of 200 PAA
     (aircraft) hours, and have completed the MPD Phase I guide. Once these requirements
     are met, the Phase I MPD pilot may be approved for Phase II via the STRP. (Note: MPD
     pilots who were Mission Ready prior to the release of this AFI may continue under the
     previous GRACC workbook for up to 6 months beyond the release date of this AFI at
     SQ/CC discretion, but will comply with all other requirements in this paragraph).
  5.3.4. MPD Phase II (V281). Not required for MAF crossflow with similar skill set (i.e., C-
  130, C-5, etc.). This phase consists of completing the MPD Phase II guide, which focuses on
  the core tasks of flying skills, mission situational awareness, and crew management required
  for Aircraft Commander certification.
     5.3.4.1. Training in this stage will ensure a balanced exposure to both left and right seats
     in the aircraft with an AC or above. Good judgment and Operational Risk Management
     (ORM) will dictate with whom they fly and what seat they occupy. As Phase II MPD
     pilots advance in knowledge, they are encouraged to practice actual mission management
     skills and decision making under the guidance of their AC or IP.
     5.3.4.2. MPD Selection for Aircraft Commander Upgrade/Certification. Phase II MPD
     pilots must meet pre-requisites defined in Table 5.1. as well as complete the MPD Phase
     II guide. Based upon performance, experience, and requisite flight hours, Phase II MPD
     pilots will be identified for upgrade by squadron leadership via the STRP. MPD pilots
     require a minimum of one AF Form 8 evaluation after FP mission ready certification and
     prior to entry into Aircraft Commander upgrade (N/A for MAF crossflow, FAIP/OSA, or
     non- mobility weapon system pilots).
     5.3.4.3. HQ AMC Orientation Tour / GRACC (V282). This event provides an in-depth
     look at selected HQ AMC and 618 AOC (TACC) operations as well as an opportunity to
     interact with command senior staff. Ideally, this course should be completed by Aircraft
     Commander candidates after completing V281, but before beginning formal Aircraft
     Commander upgrade training (ACU or PCO). GRACC is mandatory for AMC pilots and
     highly encouraged for PACAF, USAFE, AFRC, and ANG mobility forces pilots
     upgrading to Aircraft Commander. GRACC is transferable between all mobility weapon
     systems. For AMC pilots, V282 will be completed prior to Aircraft Commander
     certification. If unable to complete V282 prior to certification, units may schedule
     attendance up to 90 calendar days after certification; beyond 90 calendar days requires
     OG/CC approval. See paragraph 1.18.6 for scheduling details. Additional information
     is                      available                       via                     ETCA:
     https://etca.randolph.af.mil/showcourse.asp?as_course_id=GRACC.
  5.3.5. MPD Phase III. Aircraft Commander Upgrade (ACU) or Pilot Checkout (PCO). After
  the SQ/CC determines (via the STRP) an upgrade training start date, training time begins and
 56                                         AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014


    the upgrade candidate will begin applicable ACU or PCO training events, as required (see
    Table 1.2 for in-unit training time limitations). Prior to starting training, the training office
    will open and maintain an open/active folder in TMS until the upgrade candidate is certified
    as an Aircraft Commander. Units using multiple folders to document a pilots training
    progress may combine those into a single training folder at the unit’s discretion. Training
    guides are authorized.
        5.3.5.1. Current and qualified Aircraft Commander candidates accomplishing MPD
        Phase III training events require IP supervision during non-critical phases of flight and
        direct IP supervision during critical phases of flight. Two Aircraft Commander
        candidates may sit in the left and right seats under IP supervision in the simulator, as
        required.
        5.3.5.2. The Aircraft Commander candidate will accomplish the following requirements
        prior to the Aircraft Commander Review and Certification (R&C) Board:
               5.3.5.2.1. MPD Pilot Checkout. The process for aircraft commander certification will
               include the MPD Pilot Checkout Course (PCO). Unit directed requirements
               (academic training, local sorties, etc…) should be accomplished prior to attending
               PCO.
               5.3.5.2.2. Aircraft Commander candidates must be current in applicable Mission
               Certification Training events listed in Tables 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 prior to certification.

      off, and proficiency is demonstrated IAW AFI 11-2C-17v2 grading requirements before
      recommending trainee for evaluation, or certifying the student as qualified in a tactic or
      mission. Instructors should further ensure training, operations sections, and the flight
      commander or designated representative is apprised of the trainee’s status.
      5.4.5.5. IPs must be fully aware they are responsible at all times for flight conduct and
      aircraft safety. Should the trainee’s judgment or proficiency at the controls raise a
      question in the instructor’s mind as to the trainee’s ability to safely complete a prescribed
      maneuver at any time during the flight, the instructor will immediately assume aircraft
      control. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate proper tactics, techniques,
      and procedures for the maneuver prior to the trainee resuming control of the aircraft. All
      instructors will place special emphasis on procedures for positively identifying
      emergency conditions before initiating corrective action.
      5.4.5.6. Instructor Loadmasters (IL) are responsible for student supervision and safety
      regardless of rank. Should the judgment or proficiency of the trainee raise a question in
      the instructor’s mind as to the trainee’s ability to safely execute the duties of the aircrew
      position at any time during the flight, the instructor will immediately takeover those
      duties. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate the proper method of
      executing those duties prior to the trainee resuming duties. Use instructors for any phase
      of training to capitalize on their expertise and experience.
5.5. Flight Examiner Upgrade.
   5.5.1. Flight Examiners.        SQ/CC will recommend instructors for flight examiner
   certification. Instructors identified for certification as a flight examiner will possess superior

AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                    61


     agencies for Phoenix Banner missions, and how the aircrew will interface with these
     agencies. Furthermore, the program will address the personnel to coordinate with, in case
     of diversion or delay, including the Presidential Advance Agent, US Secret Service, and
     HMX-1 representative. The goal of training is to educate crewmembers on the
     requirements for these individuals/agencies and illustrate their ability to help accomplish
     the mission. Following the review, an open book examination of AFI 11-289, corrected
     to 100 percent, will be accomplished. Before commanding a Phoenix Banner, Silver, or
     Copper mission, aircraft commanders require squadron commander certification IAW
     AFI 11-289.
  5.6.6. Operation Deep Freeze (ODF). ODF is the Department of Defense (DOD) inter/intra-
  theater air and surface logistical support of the United States Antarctic Program (USAP). It
  involves the deployment and redeployment of scientific and support personnel, resupply of
  South Pole Station, McMurdo Station, and numerous deep field research camps established
  by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of Polar Programs (OPP).
     5.6.6.1. The C-17 Aircrew Antarctic Training Program exists because of the special
     requirements and procedures necessary for the safe and effective execution of Antarctic
     airlift operations. SQ/CCs will identify their most highly qualified crewmembers for
     entry into ODF certification training. At a minimum, experienced Aircraft Commanders
     and Loadmasters should be selected. For WINFLY, each aircrew member will be
     Instructor or Evaluator qualified. C-17 aircrews employ WINFLY procedures for
     Antarctic flight operations between March and September.
     5.6.6.2. Complete the certification training program using the 62/446 OG ODF C-17
     Antarctic Training and Certification guide and syllabus. ODF pilot and loadmaster
     Airland, Airdrop, and NVG operations each require a separate one-time certification
     (there is no NVG certification for loadmasters). Once certified for these events, currency
     is valid for three ODF seasons. If a pilot becomes non-current for an ODF event, the
     pilot will act as PF or PM under direct supervision of an ODF Instructor Pilot to regain
     currency. Non-current Loadmasters must be under the supervision of an ODF Instructor
     Loadmaster. WINFLY is a separate one-time certification, though completing any ODF
     event will satisfy currency requirements.

                                  TRAINING SYSTEM (TS)

6.1. Description. The Training System (TS), is a system where a civilian contractor provides
academic, simulator, and other designated aircrew training. TS courses are listed in Table 6.1.
   6.1.1. The purpose of this chapter is to inform aircrew members of key components of the
   TS contract. If this Air Force instruction conflicts with the TS contract, the TS contract takes
   precedent.
6.2. Applicability. As defined in AFI 11-202v1.
   6.2.1. Purpose. The C-17 TS is a system of academics, ATD sessions, and ground and flight
   training phases. This system provides qualification, upgrade, and continuation training to
   attain and maintain appropriate qualification for C-17 crewmembers and maintenance engine
   run technicians. IAW the TS contract, the contractor provides training courseware,
   academic, ATD instruction and the US Air Force provides flight instruction.
   6.2.2. Goal. The goal of the TS program is to optimize aircrew training through the
   integrated use of academics, ATD, and flightline C-17 aircraft instruction. The C-17 TS by
   contract establishes performance requirements in the TS Statement of Work (SOW) and
   system specification. The TS Master Task Listing/Evaluation Standards Document
   (MTL/ESD), objective media analysis report (OMAR), and media selection syllabus report
   (MSSR) products (approved by HQ AMC/A3T) help define C-17 course content, standards,
   and media selected for each task and objective, respectively.
6.3. Dedicated Training Time. As defined in AFI 11-202v1.
   6.3.1. It is imperative that students complete training in a timely and uninterrupted manner.
   Students will enroll on a full-time basis. Unit commanders will relieve students of duties not
   directly related to training. EXCEPTION: Senior Officer Course (SOC) students may
   continue their normal duties as time permits.
6.4. TS Course Prerequisites. TS course prerequisites are listed in Table 5.1. Each TS course
is designed and based on student prerequisites being met. Prerequisites may include a minimum
number of flying hours, squadron operations officer/flight examiner recommendation, and
completion of applicable training guides.

2. Previously qualified instructors who attended a MWS formal course may upgrade in-unit
without a waiver with OG/CC approval. See Chapter 5.
3. Split courses require MAJCOM waiver and coordination with AMC/A3TF. Initial
qualification flying training conducted in-unit is considered the secondary method. Split
courses may incur additional MAJCOM costs.
4. Course available for MOB (in-unit) use only. Not available at Altus.
5. Coordinate all in-unit SOC courses with AMC/A3T.
6.5. Lesson Objectives: Instructors and evaluators use lesson objectives as a reference
document to establish training and evaluation standards. The lesson plans are an integral part of
the formal syllabus and outline course requirements.
6.6. Unsatisfactory Student Progress. Commanders or government representatives (CORs,
wing training, operations officer, etc.) that receive notification of substandard student
performance will make a determination to continue or terminate the training after a review of the
students training records. See formal course syllabus or MAJCOM policy for further guidance.
 64                                    AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014


   6.6.1. Unit commanders or training offices receive feedback for students who display
   substandard performance.
   6.6.2. Remediation Procedures. Units will establish local procedures to promptly notify the
   TS contractor and CORs of failed flight evaluations culminating a TS course.
       6.6.2.1. Remediation subsequent to a failed flight evaluation may be accomplished by
       the TS contractor, Air Force, or a jointly, depending on the nature of failure. In every
       case, close coordination is required to achieve maximum trainee progress and direct
       contact with appropriate TS instructor supervisor is highly encouraged. If an aircrew
       member is unable to achieve, progress, or maintain qualification level and requires
       remedial training, it shall be documented in TMS and/or on AF Form 8.
       6.6.2.2. Remediation Scheduling:
          6.6.2.2.1. When a trainee is required to return for remediation regarding deficient
          areas, the trainee’s unit, appropriate wing or group training office, and TS training
          manager will coordinate training start and completion dates. Previously qualified
          crew members should be enrolled in the UNQXX course in TMS to document all
          remediation training.
          6.6.2.2.2. Government representatives (CORs, wing training, operations officer, etc.)
          receive notification when the TS contractor determined no further amount of
          instruction will result in the individual attaining required MTL or ESD/SOE
          proficiency level. The trainee stays in training status until deemed qualified by an Air
          Force evaluator or the student is eliminated by the cognizant Air Force authority. At
          minimum, the Air Force TS COR will receive a courtesy copy of this documentation.
          The Air Force will review the TS contractor’s documentation and recommendations
          regarding trainee performance. The Air Force will determine whether or not to
          continue any further training for that trainee, using TS instruction, or otherwise
          terminate all training in accordance with MAJCOM directives and the course
          syllabus.
6.7. Courseware Changes. Changes to TS courseware, including MTL, phase training and
ESD/SOE, may be proposed by any C-17 crewmember. Complete recommended change on TS
contractor’s change proposal form and submit to the local COR. Change proposals will be sent
through wing or group training and TS COR offices to 97 TRS/TRC at Altus AFB. 97 TRS/TRC
will coordinate with the TS contractor and the originator and will provide feedback to reflect
action taken. Contract proposal forms are available from TS contractor training manager at each
site.
6.8. Scheduling:
   6.8.1. General. Each unit will submit annual simulator requests for local training to
   AMC/A3TA (normally between July and August) to ensure contractual throughput
   requirements are met and total system simulator capacity is available. Local procedures will
   be developed at each MOB for scheduling TS trainees. MOB wing or group training offices
   will ensure procedures minimize schedule changes and turbulence.
   6.8.2. Training throughput. Annual throughput for specific TS courses is established in the
   TS contract. The AETC PFT document reflects formal school throughput based on Air Force
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                    65


  requirements and what is authorized by contract. If the contract throughput for any MOB
  (formal school or otherwise) will be exceeded, HQ AMC/A3T will coordinate those
  requirements through appropriate Air Force and TS contractor channels. In conjunction with
  their COR office, wing or group training offices will monitor annual throughput (current or
  projected) according to their MOB TS authorized throughput and notify HQ AMC/A3T of
  differences either above or below what is authorized in the contract.
     6.8.2.1. The TS contractor establishes class sizes for individual courses. Every attempt
     will be made by MOB wing or group training office to ensure all classes are filled before
     requesting secondary method. TS may accommodate less than full classes on a case-by-
     case basis when class is needed to obtain MR status.
     6.8.2.2. TS training at alternate sites. The TS contractor determines the required number
     of TS instructors and resources needed to accommodate annual throughput. Projected
     annual throughput is based on Air Force manpower data, which includes assigned, on-
     loan, and attached active duty as well as designated ARC and other units specified to be
     trained at that MOB. Trainee scheduling at a particular MOB should be kept within the
     units designated for that MOB. If a unit is unable to complete their requirements at a
     designated site, units may receive training at another site with prior coordination between
     the unit, the site and AMC/A3T.
  6.8.3. Cancellations. Deletions from the TS schedule will vary at each training site because
  of training courses offered and the impact to scheduling. Continued cancellations will
  greatly impact the overall annual training plan, and the contractor may be unable to
  accommodate the original, planned throughput.
     6.8.3.1. Simulator lessons will be canceled or changed no later than 1200 hours the day
     prior to the scheduled lesson. Cancellation procedures will be developed at each MOB
     between the TS contractor and wing training.
  6.8.4. Air Force Time. By contract, each site is allocated Air Force usage time on training
  equipment. The amount of AF time varies by site and is allocated and controlled by
  AMC/A3T and is intended for safety of flight research, testing, procedures development, VIP
  tours, SIMCERT and other needs as directed by AMC/A3T. Scheduling of AF time will not
  interfere with student training. This time is not normally used for aircrew training. Use of
  any left-over time is at the discretion of the OG/CC, and will be coordinated through wing or
  group-level training offices. When scheduled, the training device will be fully operational
  and manned with an operator.
  6.8.5. TS Course Pre-Work. TS courses may require trainee preparation before class start.
  The pre-work is an integral portion of the course and will be accomplished to receive course
  completion credit.       Pre-work may consist of reviewing study references, quizzes,
  performance data preparation, workbooks, etc. Required pre-work is described in the
  appropriate student training guide. When required, student training guides and workbooks
  are distributed to units in time for pre-work completion.
  6.8.6. Late or No-Show. Course completion credit may be withheld when trainee tardiness
  interferes with class training. For WST, cockpit systems simulator (CSS), and loadmaster
  simulator (LS) sessions, tardiness is defined as 15 minutes after mission briefing time. Those
  classes, which cannot be conducted without the late trainee’s presence, will be canceled at
 66                                   AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014


   the 30-minute point (e.g., a WST session with pilot no-show will be canceled if the mission
   cannot be effectively conducted). While TS contractor personnel are not required to
   substitute for missing or late crewmembers, contractor personnel may fill a crew position per
   existing contractor/government agreements.
   6.8.7. Virtual Flag/DMO exercises. Virtual Flag (VF) is a CSAF directed exercise that
   incorporates aircrew participants in flight simulators, DoD forces in the field, and computer
   generated participants in a Distributed Mission Operation (DMO) environment (Virtual Flag
   is comparable to Red Flag, Green Flag, and Maple Flag exercises). Unit participation and
   planning for VF/DMO exercises is essential. Participating units provide tactics/mission
   planners to employ tactics, techniques, and procedures and conduct unit-level mission
   planning requirements. Units will schedule an entire aircrew (aircraft commander, pilot, and
   loadmaster) for each Virtual Flag mission. Aircrews may be required to conduct mission
   planning prior to the exercise. Loadmasters may participate in the linked Loadmaster
   Simulator (LS) and/or in the Aircraft Vehicle Simulator (AVS). Aircrew members may
   receive credit for day two of quarterly phase simulator training upon completion of a
   successful Virtual Flag (or similar JCS/MAJCOM-directed) exercise with OG/CC approval.
   6.8.8. Distributed Mission Training (DMT). DMT links local or long-distance flight
   simulators for continuation training purposes and provides realistic single ship, airdrop
   formation, and air refueling procedures training.
6.9. Administration:
   6.9.1. TS Feedback
      6.9.1.1. Air Force-appointed TS Contract Officer Representatives (COR) are primary
      focal points and the liaison agency between the Air Force and the TS contractor. CORs
      are the only Air Force personnel empowered to evaluate any component of contract
      compliance. These individuals are entrusted with quality assurance, are the only
      appropriate office (unit-level) to direct contractor to perform or stop work via the
      contracting officer’s direction, and are accountable for these actions. Each wing or group
      commander will establish TS COR positions and enforce directives, requirements, and
      procedures established by DoD and MAJCOM directives and publications. TS CORs
      will maintain a current copy of the TS contract(s), designated quality assurance
      regulations and directives, and quality assurance procedures. Local CORs will provide
      feedback on C-17 TS performance and contract compliance to Det 2, AMCAOS. Provide
      a courtesy copy of all monthly Contract Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) reports
      and corrective action requests to Det 2, AMCAOS.
      6.9.1.2. Operational Evaluation. The contractor plans for and conducts operational
      evaluations of the C-17 TS in accordance with the government's process specified in AF
      Manual (AFMAN) 36-2234, Instructional System Development (ISD). The objective of
      this ongoing “operational evaluation” is to assure the TS produces qualified graduates.
      The contractor’s system will ensure a steady flow of information to maintain quality,
      effectiveness, and currency in the TS. Revisions to the TS will be based on this
      information.
6.10. Training Implementation/Student Expectations. Students will review the student
schedule and needed courses section of TMS to ensure compliance with training requirements.
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                        67


Students are expected to review their instructor’s comments and to complete pre-requisite
training in a timely manner. Formal school students will ensure all pre-requisite CBT lessons are
completed prior to simulator or training device lessons. Failure to complete pre-requisite lessons
may result in a failing grade for a simulator or training device lesson and subsequent course
removal. See AETC formal school syllabus for pre-requisite requirements and further guidance.
6.11. Browsing Training Products. In order to increase their technical proficiency, C-17
crewmembers and engine-run personnel are encouraged to browse TS program lessons.
Browsing is limited to a space-available basis, and all requests will be coordinated with the TS
training supervisor.
   6.11.1. Browsing a lesson does not, by itself, enable a trainee to take the end-of-lesson test.
6.12. Remediation Trainees are not to be scheduled to browse lessons for
remediation. Remediation will be scheduled by coordinating with the TS contractor. Browsing
a lesson does not enable the trainee to take the end-of-lesson test. Trainees in remediation will be
enrolled in lessons for review in order to take the end-of-lesson test.
6.13. Aircraft Flights for TS Training Instructors.
   6.13.1. The TS contractor provides opportunity for Air Force flight instructors to
       observe trainee progress in ATDs. Likewise, the terms and conditions of the current
   government contract allow TS instructors to observe the trainee's aircraft flights. In some
   cases, TS courseware may state these specific occurrences.
   6.13.2. Contractor Personnel Flight Operations. TS Contractors may fly on a non-
   interference basis aboard USAF aircraft IAW the terms and provisions of the current
   government contract, as provided for in AFI 11-401.
6.14. TS Facility Tours:
   6.14.1. Wing training offices will coordinate all requests for C-17 TS facility tours with the
   contractor as soon as possible, but in no case later than 24 hours prior to the planned event.
   This may require close coordination with public affairs and protocol. AF time may be used
   at the discretion of the OG/CC. Tours will be on an as-available basis and will not displace
   scheduled training events.
   6.14.2. OG/CC will ensure an Air Force representative meets, greets, accompanies, and
   conducts all tours. The contractor is not manned for or on contract to perform these duties.
   The contractor shall be responsible for providing an aircrew training device operator only.

  7.4.4. AD05 AD-Personnel.
     7.4.4.1. Purpose: Continuation training for airdrop-qualified crewmembers
     7.4.4.2. Description: See AFTTP 3-3.C-17 and AFI 11-2C-17v3
     7.4.4.3. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
     7.4.4.4. Training Media: Aircraft or WST
     7.4.4.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training
     7.4.4.6. Additional Information: Pilots may credit this event during actual or dry passes.
     Loadmasters log this event only when actual personnel are loaded, rigged, all checklists
     through the slowdown checklist are accomplished, and there is not a no-drop condition
     due to loadmaster error. Dual log with AD01.
  7.4.5. AD09 JPADS Medium/High Altitude Airdrop.
     7.4.5.1. Purpose: Continuation training for airdrop-qualified crewmembers
     7.4.5.2. Description: JPADS (guided or unguided) airdrop at medium or high altitude.
     While high altitude airdrop is defined as 3,000 feet AGL and above, crewmembers
     should attempt to practice airdrops at 10,000 feet AGL and above. Event may be credited
     when flown at or above AFTTP 3-1.C-17 altitudes. See AFTTP 3-3.C-17 and/or AFI 11-
     2C-17v3 for high-altitude airdrop procedures.
     7.4.5.3. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
     7.4.5.4. Training Media: Aircraft or WST
     7.4.5.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training
     7.4.5.6. Additional Information: Crewmembers will perform their airdrop duties while
     on oxygen in order to credit the event, regardless of airdrop altitude flown. Due to drop
     zone size considerations, actual airdrop may be simulated as long as all checklists are
     completed. Units may credit this event in the simulator. Dual log with AD01.
  7.4.6. AD10 JPADS (guided) Airdrop
     7.4.6.1. Purpose: Continuation training for JPADS certified loadmasters.
     7.4.6.2. Description: JPADS (guided) airdrop to include flight station and cargo
     compartment configuration, completion of JPADS checklists, and JPADS (guided)
     airdrop to an appropriate DZ. Certified loadmasters will load drop an actual JPADS
     (guided) bundle. If DZ requirements prevent actual drop, simulate a guided bundle drop
     through completion of the JPADS (guided) airdrop slowdown checklist.
     7.4.6.3. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
     7.4.6.4. Training Media: Aircraft
     7.4.6.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
     7.4.6.6. Additional Information: If dropping an actual JPADS guided bundle is not
     practical, loadmasters still require an AGU rigged on a bundle aboard the aircraft to
             simulate all necessary checklist steps. Loadmasters may credit the event if all
     checklists     through the slowdown checklist are completed.
AFI11-2C-17V1_452AMWSUP_I 15 JANUARY 2014                                                     71


  7.4.7. AD11 PADS Operator Unguided Airdrop.
     7.4.7.1. Purpose:   Continuation training for PADS operator certified mission-ready
     pilots.
     7.4.7.2. Description: I-CDS (JPADS unguided) airdrop to include mission planning,
     JPADS computer preflight and inflight actions, flight station and cargo compartment
     configuration, JPADS checklists, dropsonde release/monitoring, aircraft damage
              estimate, and I-CDS airdrop to an appropriate DZ. Crews will comply with all
     requirements of AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and Landing Zone Operations. The I-CDS
     airdrop is considered complete with successful deployment of the dropsonde(s), update of
     the release point via PADS computer and airdrop of the bundle. There is no minimum
     altitude for this event when accomplished in the aircraft, other than the minimum altitude
     to release a dropsonde, though realistic AFTTP 3-1.C-17 altitudes should be used to the
     maximum extent possible based on airspace and DZ restrictions. In the event that the
     dropsonde(s) was (were) deployed but insufficient dropsonde data was gathered to update
              the release point with the PADS computer, the crew will make all reasonable
     attempts to troubleshoot the problem, to include completion of the I-CDS/JPADS
     troubleshooting guide. If these procedures fail to correct the problem, then at the
     discretion of the aircraft commander, the event can still be considered complete if the
     crew successfully airdrops the bundle by completing the I-CDS/JPADS to Conventional
     Quick Transition Checklist, and performing a racetrack/re-attack using conventional
     ballistic CDS procedures.
     7.4.7.3. OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
     7.4.7.4. Training Media: Aircraft or USAF-certified WST.
     7.4.7.5. Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
     7.4.7.6. Additional Information: Must perform all PADS duties to credit the event.
     PADS operators may credit this event in any MDS. PADS operators may not log this
     event while occupying either pilot's seat. 50% of events may be credited in the WST
     only if all the specified training requirements listed within this section are completed. If
     performing PO duties in a different MDS, Pads Operators will only log AD11.

A2.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training
documentation. The training management system (TMS) performs standardized training
documentation functions for all C-17 units. HQ AMC/A3TA and Det 2, AMCAOS at Altus
AFB are the POCs and liaison with the TS contractor for TMS changes and recommendations.
Coordinate all recommended changes through MAJCOM to HQ AMC/A3TA and Det 2
AMCAOS.
   A2.1.1. TMS will be used for all formal training listed in the Air Force Education and
   Training Course Announcements database (either at formal school or in-unit), mission
   qualification, special qualification or in-unit upgrade program to the next higher crew
   qualification, including Mobility Pilot Development (MPD), requalification training (either at
   formal school or in-unit), or for any corrective action or additional training.
   A2.1.2. Web-based TMS provides world-wide access to instructors and supervisory
   personnel. Instructors, Aircraft Commanders, training office personnel, Ops Officers and
   Commanders may obtain access through the TS contractor’s portal. Contact the local TS
   contractor site manager for access.
   A2.1.3. The instructor or trainer will review TMS prior to all training periods. Those areas
   not previously accomplished or those, in which crewmembers require additional training,
   will be noted for possible inclusion during the current training period.
   A2.1.4. The commander or operations officer will review training progress via squadron
   training officer brief or TMS review at least once each calendar quarter, prior to attending a
   formal course at the FTU, and prior an evaluation on all crewmembers in upgrade training.
   (EXCEPTION: Not required for recurring evaluations and students attending courses at the
   FTU). These training reviews can count as the training representative’s monthly review.
   A2.1.5. Squadron training representatives will conduct a monthly review of crew members
   in active training status (EXCEPTION: continuation training). All reviews shall be
   annotated under “Reviews” in TMS.
   A2.1.6. Records of crewmembers, not receiving training but in an active status for mission
   qualification, special qualification, in-unit upgrade, requalification training (i.e. extended
   DNIF), will be reviewed monthly and quarterly as indicated above. If applicable, the
   statement, "no training accomplished during this period," the reason why, and the projected
   date when training will resume will be entered in TMS. This statement is not required for
   crew members in continuation training.
   A2.1.7. TMS write-ups will be made for pre-aircraft commander and pre-instructor MPD
   pilots. At a minimum these write-ups will include any training in time control, air refueling,
   assault landings, and/or low levels.
A2.2. Unit training offices will ensure all training waivers are documented in TMS. Waivers
approved on the AMC waiver web-page are automatically forwarded to TMS and placed in the
crew members “waiver” folder. However, unit training offices will ensure individual waivers are
recorded in TMS during required record reviews. Waivers not issued via the AMC waiver web

page will be cut-and-pasted into the individual’s waiver folder. Reference the waiver authority
and date authorized in lieu of a signature.
A2.3. TMS Checklists. The checklist feature of TMS allows MAF standardization of training
programs. It also allows units to add local requirements that need to be documented in the
individuals TMS record. AMC/A3TA will provide standard MAF checklists generic to all C-17
units. Unit checklists will not be used to replace or duplicate courses in TMS. However, units
may add locally developed checklists that are maintained by the unit level (OSS/OST) training
office. Review unit checklist periodically and update them as necessary. Delete unused or
unneeded checklists annually.
   A2.3.1. Ground training events accomplished at the formal school will be annotated on the
   MAF Standardized Ground Training Events Checklist in TMS. Gaining units will review
   each crew member’s ground training events checklist after arrival from the FTU. Events not
   accomplished at the FTU will be conducted by the gaining unit prior to completion of
   mission ready training.
