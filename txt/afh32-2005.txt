                                  Chapter 1
                                   SCOPE

1.1. General. This handbook explains doctrine and procedures to guide com-
manders and FES personnel at all levels in protecting mission resources dur-
ing contingencies. These contingencies may include but are not limited too;
major combat operations, humanitarian relief operations, responses to man-
made or natural disasters, etc. These operations may occur at bare bases, for-
ward operating locations, co-located bases, or aerial ports.
1.2. Mission. The Air Force FES mission is to prevent fires, minimize injuries
and loss of life and property, and alleviate negative impact to the environment
occurring in periods of peace, war, and humanitarian support operations. In-
cluded are both man-made and natural incidents; fire suppression and hazard
mitigation, rescue, mitigation or containment of releases of hazardous mate-
rials (HAZMAT), such as chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, or high-
yield explosive (CBRNE) agents, resulting from industrial accidents, terror-
ism, or weapons of mass destruction (WMD); and emergency medical sup-
port.
1.3. Contingency Firefighting. During contingency operations, firefighting
forces are the primary installation emergency response team and are responsi-
ble for supporting the commander’s primary requirement to launch and recov-
er sorties. To meet this requirement, FES operations may differ from normal
peacetime operations. The information contained herein will assist command-
ers and firefighters in understanding the risks and calculated assessments re-
quired to sustain the contingency FES mission. Typical contingency manpow-
er and resources are based on the War Mobilization Plan, Volume 1 (WMP-1),
CE Supplement, Appendix 5 (for wartime planning), or AFPAM 32-2004,
Aircraft Fire Protection for Military Operations Other Than War (MOOTW),
(short duration operations generally less than 120 days). Note: The primary
contingency FES mission is to support sortie generation; protecting critical,
high priority components supporting the flying mission is secondary. Deci-
sion-makers at all levels must be informed when FES resources or capabilities
are below standard requirements, including reduced manning, vehicle, equip-
ment, and agent levels. Since home station FES resources are shared to sup-
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                       10

port contingency operations, risk management must be employed more ag-
gressively due to the reduced FES resources at both home stations and contin-
gency locations. Additional risk is expected at both locations.
1.4. LIMFACS. Firefighters may have limited capabilities or resources during
contingency operations (especially during initial stages of a deployment). The
amount of resources common to peacetime operations, such as manpower,
vehicles, agents and equipment, may not be available.
1.4.1. UTCs do not exist separately for training, logistics, Fire Alarm Com-
munications Center (FACC), or extinguisher maintenance. These functions
may be performed by shift personnel as additional duties during contingen-
cies. Additionally, unique contingency tasks such as security, shelter man-
agement and Contamination Control Area (CCA) operations will also be the
responsibility of shift personnel until follow-on forces arrive. Fire chiefs must
prioritize the functions of the flight during risk assessment so sortie support is
not compromised during the initial stages of a deployment.
1.4.2. Emergency response capability is greatly reduced when operating in the
Joint Firefighter Integrated Response Ensemble (JFIRE) due to the ensemble
placing additional physical burdens on the firefighter. Physical challenges
related to JFIRE include increased weight, thermal burden, increased difficul-
ty breathing through the C-2 canister, the need for increased work-rest cycles
(WRC) and rehabilitation difficulties after an emergency response. These
LIMFACS must be considered during emergency operations. Expectations
from firefighters must be reduced and a focus on protecting only the highest
priority resources.
1.4.3. Lack of adequate water supply will limit FES capability.
1.4.4. Fire vehicles carry required fire fighting agents and firefighters to the
scene of the fire. Reductions in vehicles diminish response capability.
1.4.5. FES resources will be vulnerable to attack until splinter protection, har-
dening and contamination avoidance measures are in place. This includes re-
sources such as fire facilities, vehicles, communications equipment, personnel,
rescue equipment, extinguishing agents and personal protective equipment
(PPE).
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                     11

1.4.6. Limited supplies of extinguishing agents (Aqueous Film Forming Foam
(AFFF), dry chemical, and water) will hinder or prevent operations to extin-
guish fires involving petroleum, oil, and lubricant (POL) tanks or aircraft.
1.4.7. Enemy attack may include CBRNE or ground attack by enemy forces.
Consequently, unexploded ordnance (UXO) can delay fire response. The se-
nior fire officer (SFO) must ensure UXOs blocking access to mission essential
assets are cleared by explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel as soon as
possible. In this environment, firefighters must perform explosive ordnance
reconnaissance (EOR) after an attack and during responses that will cause
delays. These delays may allow fires to progress prior to FES arrival, increas-
ing the need for larger amounts of firefighting agents. If appropriate, the SFO
may allow some fires to burn to save resources for higher priorities or to avoid
unreasonable risk to firefighters.
1.4.8. The absence of armored firefighting vehicles limits responses to areas
inside the fence in hostile environments where attacks “outside the wire” are
expected. Responses outside the wire will only occur with approval of the
installation commander and follow guidelines established for such responses.
Procedures for outside the wire operations must be prepared and approved at
the beginning of operations.

                          PLANNING GUIDANCE

3.1. Introduction. The focus of fire resources in wartime or during contin-
gencies is fire prevention and fire fighting. Fire prevention focuses on prepar-
ing occupants and operators to operate safely to prevent fires and detect and
intervene early at fires that occur. The fire fighting element protects weapons
systems and facilities needed to accomplish the mission. A critical first step is
to develop a list of priorities at the site. This is a corporative effort with the
Emergency Management element. At some locations, aircraft may be the
highest priority for protection while at others, facilities may be more critical
than aircraft. Wartime staffing assumes operating from a central fire station
where all resources are based. It also assumes that only one major emergency
event will occur at a time. Risk assessment and management procedures, re-
sponse time standards and operational procedures are similar to home station
operations. FES response strategies may be complicated by the presence of
chemical agents, antipersonnel devices, and munitions. FES capability must
be included in appropriate base recovery plans.
3.2. Force Packages. Firefighters are postured into force packages identified
by unit type codes (UTC).
3.2.1. The 6-person Fire Operations team (4FPFP) is the basic building block.
It provides the manpower to manage emergency operations, including staffing
fire trucks and communications centers.
3.2.2. The 2-person Incident Command team (4FPFJ) provides mid-level su-
pervision and incident command for firefighting operations.
3.2.3. Fire Management teams (4FPFN/4FPFA) serve as the fire chief/ flight
chief and provides overall FES flight management. The teams establish and
maintain FES capability and serve as the principle fire risk manager and advi-
sor to senior leaders minimizing loss of life and property.
3.2.4. The 2-person Fire Inspection Prevention team (4FPFG) provides fire
inspection and prevention capability.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                    16

3.2.5. The 3-person 4FPS4 team provides command and control (C2)-level
staff assistance at a Numbered Air Force, MAJCOM Headquarters, or forward
operating location (FOL).
3.2.6. Attachment 10 lists the FES UTC MISCAPS for quick reference; how-
ever, when MAJCOM planners source contingency manpower and vehicle
requirements use the most current UTCs found on the CE UTC Management

3.3. Vehicles and Equipment. Fire vehicles and equipment may be in-place
or pre-positioned. SFOs identify shortfalls in firefighting vehicles and equip-
ment through an analysis of operations at the site. Where shortages exist, ve-
hicles may be leased with adequate lead time; when lead time is not available,
vehicles may be tasked from home station fleets and backfilled with leased
vehicles as soon as possible. Additional vehicles and support equipment may
be needed at any stage of a conflict. Note: Functional expertise is available
from the Headquarters Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (HQ
AFCESA) Readiness Operations Center at: DSN: 523-6229; Commercial:
(850) 283-6229, Duty Officer: (850) 624-7446, and Tyndall AFB Command

3.3.2. During wartime the number of aircraft rescue and fire fighting (ARFF)
vehicles required varies according to the size of aircraft assigned to the instal-
lation or the size of aircraft at the installation more than 50 percent of the
time. Table 3.2 indicates the ideal core set of vehicles and personnel UTCs
required for fire ground operations. Note: Table 3.2 applies to wartime opera-
tions only. For determining manpower and equipment requirements for all
other contingencies, refer to AFPAM 32-2004.

Notes:
1. Use Table 3.1 to determine substitute vehicles when the ideal vehicles are
not available.
2. Availability of P-23s is limited. P-19s, available in large numbers, may be
used to fill the requirement but will require more vehicles and additional per-
sonnel UTCs. Add a 4FPFP for every two ARFF vehicles above the number
required for P-23s. For example, at a Category 2 installation using P-19s in-
stead of P-23s, 6 vehicles would be required, 2 more than required for P-23s.
One additional 4FPFP UTCs would also be required.
3.3.3. For unique situations such as AF installations without assigned aircraft,
installations where only rotary wing or unmanned aircraft are assigned, or
large installations that require more than one fire station to meet emergency
response time standards, consult the appropriate command/theater fire chief
for assistance.
3.4. Operational Risk Management (ORM).
3.4.1. Risk requires a subjective assessment of the probability that an FES
emergency event will occur, and the expected severity of such an event. The
probability factor relies heavily on historic emergency response data to predict
future events. But for contingency operations, historical data is not available
and assumptions must be made on which to estimate risk.
3.4.1.1. Probability. Anecdotal information indicates that fire emergency
events are more probable during contingencies due to the intensity of aircraft
operations, temporary construction and the potential for enemy actions (such
as aircraft battle damage).
3.4.1.2. Severity. The severity of fire emergency events is expected to greater
than for home stations due to the use of combustible materials in temporary
construction and temporary wiring.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                      19

3.4.2. Risk management primarily involves allocating resources according to
the risk. Normally, resources are allocated according to the most probable
time of day and day of the week that a fire emergency event will occur, from
historic fire response data. This data may not be available at contingency loca-
tions. Consequently, the assumption during initial operations is that the risk is
static and the same level of capability is maintained continuously. This as-
sumption is for the first 120 days of operation then response data is assessed
to determine if existing capability is still appropriate. For more information
regarding risk management see AFI 32-2001, chapter 6.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                   20

                                 Chapter 4
                INSTALLATION FIREFIGHTING PLAN

4.1. Introduction. This chapter outlines tactics, techniques, procedures
(TTPs), and generic guidelines to enhance the survivability of firefighters,
vehicles, equipment and resources during contingencies. Provided is an over-
view of the FES functions and responsibilities in the contingency environ-
ment. In the absence of formal training and lesson plans, this section can be
used to present training.
4.2. Planning Period. Upon arrival, the installation fire chief will create or
review plans and execute training and actions required to implement those
plans. Deployed firefighters take the following actions immediately upon ar-
rival:
4.2.1. Establish fire emergency response posture.
4.2.2. Establish fire prevention, force protection and firefighter safety pro-
grams.
4.2.3. Work with emergency managers to determine response priorities.

4.2.4. Communicate risk and capability issues to the installation commander.
For more information regarding reporting level of service capability see AFI
32-2001, chapter 6.5.
4.2.5. Determine and coordinate response capability available in the Emergen-
cy Management (EM) flight. EM personnel may have HAZMAT response
capability (training and equipment) that can help during these types of re-
sponse.

4.3. Chain of Command. The fire chief must establish the internal chain of
command, determine the installation’s chain of command and disseminate the
information to all firefighters.
4.3.1 Functional Chain of Command. The fire chief’s geographic AOR dic-
tates functional area reporting to the appropriate MAJCOM. For Joint Task
Force (JTF) operations, operational control (OPCON) will be assumed by the
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                        21

JTF Commander. Administrative Control (ADCON) will be retained by the
designated USAF functional manager.
4.4. Intelligence. Obtain current intelligence threat assessments of potential
adversary’s ability and intent to attack the installation, including the use of
WMD. Accurate information enables fire chiefs to tailor defensive pre-
planning and TTPs to mitigate the consequences of an attack.
4.5. Firefighter Safety and Health. To the maximum extent possible, NFPA
1500 shall apply during wartime and contingency operations. When com-
pliance is not possible, ORM processes must be used to deviate from NFPA
requirements. Everything possible must be done to protect firefighters but
mission comes first, which may require doing operations during war that
would not be done when at peace. However, operations or tasks that cannot
be performed safely will not be undertaken.
4.6. Long Term Planning. When intelligence indicates the deployment may
become “steady state,” the fire chief must begin long term planning after ini-
tial establishment of the installation. This requires the fire chief to evaluate the
resources in place to determine if they meet established standards. If addition-
al resources are required, plans to fix shortfalls must be communicated to lea-
dership. Plan to improve facilities and obtain proper manpower, vehicles, and
equipment for the fire station. Consider water distribution systems, utilities,
systems, command and control facilities, etc.
4.7. Plans. Plans include, but are not limited to, installation support, mobiliza-
tion, contingency response, fire prevention, training, and pre-fire plans.
4.7.1. Conducting local training is critical. Existing lesson plans may be uti-
lized and new lesson plans developed as necessary.
4.7.2. To the greatest extent possible, establish dispersal locations and obtain
shelter assets. Place assets indoors and utilize natural covering (ditches, trees,
hillsides, trenches, etc.) as much as possible. All dispersal sites will be splinter
protected and hardened if the threat dictates. Use contamination control pro-
cedures and provide appropriate levels of contamination avoidance measures
on these locations (see Attachment 2).
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                       22

4.7.3. If the treat dictates, harden and splinter-protect all non-dispersed fire
assets, including the FACC and communication network as required. Do not
overlook supplies, station generators, and fuel containment dikes.
4.7.4. Conduct pre-fire planning and train on mission assigned aircraft and
priority facilities as soon as possible.
4.7.5. Establish fire prevention, reporting, education and safety programs.
4.7.6. Train facility occupants in first aid firefighting to enable them to extin-
guish fires in the initial stages.
4.7.7. Survey water supplies for emergency use. Include both on and off in-
stallation locations to include swimming pools, lakes, rivers, towers, tankers,
pumps, wells, and basic expeditionary airfield resources (BEAR) mobile water
distribution systems. Construct expedient access routes made of dirt or gravel
and install dry hydrants and pumps as necessary to expedite re-supply opera-
tions.
4.7.8. Coordinate with POL personnel to ensure drainage, dikes and holding
areas are in place. Dikes should hold 1.5 times the container’s capacity. Sur-
vey possible fuel holding or tank drainage diversion areas where spilled fuel
can be burned off. Identify fuel transfer possibilities and determine if AFFF
inventories are adequate for the amount of fuel stored.
4.7.9. Inventory all firefighting agents and equipment; request high priority
fills for shortfalls through local supply channels and the contracting officer.
4.8. Attack Preparation Period. The following action will be taken:
4.8.1. Maintain accountability of all personnel.
4.8.2. Establish a recall roster and system to accomplish the recall.
4.8.3. The SFO initiates appropriate checklists (see Attachments 2 thru 9).
4.8.4. Establish the FACC.
4.8.5. Define what assets are available and determine what resources are
needed to support the mission while meeting appropriate Air Force standards.
Initiate shortfall requests through appropriate channels. Additional firefighting
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                   23

agents, clothing, equipment and supplies may be procured through supply
channels (establish good working relationships with Contracting and Finance).
4.8.6. When the treat dictates, firefighters will be issued chemical warfare
ensemble and nerve agent antidote based on the associated threat conditions.
Firefighters must be prepared to utilize the JFIRE ensemble.
4.8.7. Issue weapons as threat conditions dictate. Use selective arming as ne-
cessary.
4.8.8. Initiate dispersal plan as threat conditions warrant.
4.8.8.1. Disperse support assets (tools/equipment, emergency water storage
[EWS], mobile air compressor, etc.) and implement physical/chemical conta-
mination avoidance actions to maximize survivability.
4.8.8.2. Disperse vehicles and agents (see Attachment 2). Correct deficien-
cies on vehicles/agent status.
4.8.8.3. Vehicles will remain sheltered as much as possible. Vehicles may
relocate with the approval of the SFO.
4.8.9. Implement survivability measures to include contamination control for
vehicles and equipment. Black out/tone-down/splinter and chemical contami-
nation avoidance measures will be implemented for the following resources:
4.8.9.1. Fire Station (FACC communications network is a very important
priority). Include radio antenna and repeater as applicable.
4.8.9.2. Dispersal sites and personnel bunkers.
4.8.9.3. EWS sites supplementing existing emergency water sources.
4.8.9.4. Agent/equipment dispersal.
4.8.10. Determine availability of installed fire suppression systems.
4.8.11. Identify communication services for major work centers (i.e. building
location, and telephone numbers) (see Table A9.4).
4.8.12. Establish the FACC and Alternate FACC.
4.8.12.1. Establish FACC work shifts.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                         24

4.8.12.2. The SFO will:
4.8.12.2.1. Confirm and account for all firefighting resources prior to actual
response.
4.8.12.2.2. Maintain overall firefighting, fire vehicle, and equipment status.
4.8.12.2.3. Receive installation control center directives and disseminate to
firefighters.
4.8.12.2.4. Take necessary actions to reverse or limit any degradation to the
FES mission.
4.8.12.2.5. Ensure incident response reporting procedures are in place.
4.8.12.3. The FACC will maintain up to date information on the following:
4.8.12.3.1. Fire vehicles by call sign, type, registration number, and status.
4.8.12.3.2. Dispersal points of all resources and crew accountability.
4.8.12.3.3. Quantities and location of firefighting agents.
4.8.12.3.4. Installation map to chart blocked roads, craters, UXO's, CBRNE
zones, air base defense (ABD) sectors, and utility status.
4.8.12.3.5. List of static water locations and approximate amounts available.
4.8.12.3.6. Logbook will be used to document significant events.
4.8.12.3.7. Installation priority listing.
4.8.12.4. The FACC communications network is critical to the success of the
FES mission and recovery operations. Every attempt should be made to obtain
the following communications devices:
4.8.12.4.1. Primary and Secondary Crash line.
4.8.12.4.2. Fire reporting lines.
4.8.12.4.3. Direct Line or dedicated line to appropriate work centers (e.g.,
UCC).
4.8.12.4.4. Administrative line (two or more is preferred).
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                      25

4.8.12.4.5. Portable radios/batteries/charger(s).
4.8.12.4.6. Back-up generator with auto-start and transfer capability.
4.8.12.5. The alternate FACC may be activated at any time. Checklists, refer-
ence material, supplies, and communications equipment should be maintained
for this purpose.
4.8.12.6. Communication disruption/outages.
4.8.12.6.1. If communication systems fail, the following may be implemented:
4.8.12.6.1.1. Portables/mobile radios.
4.8.12.6.1.2. Alternate frequency.
4.8.12.6.1.3. Direct lines and runners.
4.8.12.6.1.4. Cellular telephones.
4.8.12.6.2. A complete list of telephone numbers will be maintained in the
FACC and command vehicles.
4.8.12.6.3. If an authentication matrix is used, see Attachment 3.
4.8.13. Operations.
4.8.13.1. Shift schedules will be determined by the SFO. Manpower authoriza-
tions are predicated on firefighters working 84 hours per week (12 or 24 hour
shifts continuously). However SFOs are not bound by this concept and may
vary the work schedule as the risk dictates. Some considerations are: Ops
TEMPO, manning levels, weather conditions, wear of PPE in chemical envi-
ronment, variations in risk, etc. It should be noted that the mission may re-
quire periods when firefighters will work for extended shifts. However, ex-
tended shifts should only be considered for limited periods when needed due
to reduced manning levels and mission requirements. Working extended shifts
significantly increases risk to firefighter safety. For deployments over 90 days,
work schedules should be adjusted to 72 hours per week where possible.
Note: Crews will be rotated in a manner as to reduce their vulnerability to
enemy attack.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                      26

4.8.13.2. The SFO should establish response priorities based on the installa-
tion’s emergency management plans, manning/ equipment status and mission
requirements. Consider things such as aircraft, structural, fuel spill, and muni-
tions incidents.
4.8.13.3. As the threat escalates, firefighters may operate from dispersed loca-
tions.
4.8.13.4. JFIRE may be required.
4.8.13.5. Shift change will be as prescribed by the SFO and IAW local direc-
tives/operating instructions (OI).
4.8.13.5.1. Assistant Chiefs (A/C) will manage shift change.
4.8.13.5.2. All firefighters must be informed of mission-oriented protective
posture (MOPP) level, threat condition and intelligence updates at shift
change.
4.8.13.6. Crew Rotation.
4.8.13.6.1. Each firefighter will be assigned to a specific vehicle. At the be-
ginning of each shift, firefighters will report to their assigned vehicle at the
A/Cs direction.
4.8.13.6.2. Normally, shift change will occur in the fire station; however, dur-
ing dispersed operations the SFO will rotate crews when safely possible.
4.8.13.6.3. Accountability for all crews and vehicle status will be accom-
plished by the SFO immediately following shift change.
4.8.13.7. If firefighters are unable to report to their pre-designated location
due to hostile activity, they will assemble in an area designated by the SFO.
Transportation to their assigned vehicle will be arranged by the SFO as situa-
tion permits.
4.8.13.8. Off duty personnel will report to their assigned billets for rest and
recuperation. The senior member must maintain accountability of all off-duty
firefighters.
4.8.14. Responses and Standbys.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                         27

4.8.14.1. At heightened threat conditions, the SFO may need to coordinate all
responses with the EOC.
4.8.14.2. Under SFO direction, the FACC will dispatch incidents using selec-
tive response procedures based on priority of asset.
4.8.15. Other Requirements.
4.8.15.1. Be prepared to selectively arm personnel as threat dictates.
4.8.15.2. Issue authentication matrix to each crew.
4.8.15.3. Secure personnel and departmental records and documentation in a
protected shelter or area.
4.8.15.4. Arriving firefighters will receive necessary briefings and billeting
during in-processing. A FES supervisor will be dispatched to the receiving
area to ensure a smooth transition.
4.9. Attack Response Period. This is the time period during an attack or hos-
tile activities that firefighting and rescue activities will be limited. Survivabili-
ty is the main priority while mission sustainment is the primary objective.
4.9.1. Upon notification that an airfield attack is imminent, the FACC will
alert dispersed fire crews. Crews must be attentive to indications of a change
in alarm condition and report pertinent information to the FACC (e.g., observ-
ing personnel taking cover, changes in displayed flags, giant voice announce-
ments, gunfire, bomb bursts, etc). If differences in alarm conditions exist, take
cover until the difference is resolved.
4.9.2. Personnel actions.
4.9.2.1. Firefighters must be protected with the appropriate individual protec-
tive ensemble (IPE) according to current alarm conditions. They must be able
to instantly cease any operation and take immediate cover in the event of an
attack. Be alert to surprise and re-attack possibilities. Always be aware of the
nearest personnel bunker.
4.9.2.1.1. Unless specifically directed by the SFO, do not perform any rescue/
firefighting operations except immediate area self-aid and buddy care (SABC)
while attack is occurring.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                      28

4.9.2.1.2. If away from dispersal site when an attack occurs, DO NOT attempt
to return to the dispersal location. Stop and take appropriate cover where you
are.
4.9.2.2. Personnel in vehicles not in splinter protected facilities will seek the
best available protection in their area.
4.9.3. Communications will be kept to an absolute minimum during and im-
mediately after attacks. During the attack, firefighters should provide size,
activity, location, uniform, time, and equipment (SALUTE) reports to the
SFO.
4.10. Attack Recovery Period.
4.10.1. Dispersed crew actions.
4.10.1.1. Upon notification that an attack is over, fire crews will immediately
account for crew members, perform SABC as required, perform a thorough
UXO sweep, check for damage/contamination, and verify status/condition of
assigned assets. Report status to the FACC once completed.
4.10.1.2. Note UXO locations.
4.10.1.2.1. Remain at least 300 feet from UXOs; do not transmit hand-held
radios within 25 feet of UXOs or 100 feet for mobile radios.
4.10.1.2.2. Identify, mark, and report all UXOs to the FACC IAW AFMAN
10-100, Airman’s Manual.
4.10.1.2.3. Make note of other UXO reports as this may alter pending re-
sponse routes to future emergencies/incidents.
4.10.1.3. Note improvised explosive device (IED) locations.
4.10.1.3.1. Withdraw all non-essential personnel IAW AFMAN 10-100. Per-
sonnel will be behind or under cover.
4.10.1.4. IAW AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards, minimum with-
drawal distances for IEDs are:
4.10.1.4.1. 500 feet if IED is a small item or box (up to 2 cubic feet).
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                       29

4.10.1.4.2. 1,000 feet if IED is a barrel or car (up to 15 cubic feet).
4.10.1.4.3. 1,500 feet if IED is a van or truck.
4.10.1.4.4. 2,000 feet if IED is larger than already described.
4.10.1.4.5. Responding command authorities and EOD personnel will evaluate
and adjust distances if needed. Withdrawal distances are for initial evacuation
until command authorities and EOD personnel evaluate the incident.
4.10.1.5. Report facility/asset damage.
4.10.1.6. Report personnel injuries.
4.10.1.7. Inspect/report M-8 and M-9 readings on vehicles and dispersed as-
sets.
4.10.1.8. Conduct operational decontamination as required.
4.10.2. Firefighting Actions.
4.10.2.1. When directed, fire crews will proceed to the incident site.
4.10.2.2. All responses by firefighting vehicles will be made IAW local guid-
ance. Pre-fire plans will be utilized at the scene of facility and aircraft fires.
4.10.2.3. Responding crews will report their observations to the FACC.
4.10.3. SFO actions.
4.10.3.1. The SFO/FACC will immediately announce alarm condition changes
and initiate an after attack vehicle/equipment/personnel status check.
4.10.3.2. Mission sustainment and firefighter safety is the SFO’s primary con-
cern. It may not be possible to extinguish every fire and perform every rescue,
prudent judgment on when and how to engage firefighting forces is paramount
to the success of our mission. The SFO directs the allocations of firefighting
resources in concert with command priorities and current mission sustainment
and installation recovery operations. In the event of multiple responses, the
commander and the SFO must coordinate on which fires to let burn and which
to engage; which rescues to perform and which to leave to SABC. Decisions
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                     30

are usually made in relation to sortie generation and aircraft recovery, depend-
ing on current response capabilities/commitments.
4.10.3.3. The FACC will establish an effective flow of communications be-
tween the SFO, appropriate work centers, and firefighting crews.
4.10.3.4. The SFO exercises primary control of responding vehicles. Normal-
ly, the A/C will command the fire ground; however, crew chiefs may perform
this function on multiple incidents. The following considerations govern what
vehicles, if any, are dispatched to incidents:
4.10.3.4.1. Equipment/agent availability.
4.10.3.4.2. Alarm condition.
4.10.3.4.3. Access to incident.
4.10.3.4.4. Firefighting crew status.
4.10.3.4.5. Priority.
4.10.3.4.6. Physical security.
4.10.4. Responses.
4.10.4.1. The EOC director, through the SFO, approves responses before dis-
patch. Responding crews will not deviate from their assignment to render as-
sistance at other incidents. They will however, report their observations to the
FACC. Resource priorities are listed in the facility priority list; this must be
maintained in the FACC and as required by the SFO.
4.10.4.2. When necessary, use the authentication matrix prior to responding to
validate all responses or orders (see Attachment 3).
4.10.4.3. If damages exceed firefighting capability, the SFO will request “Let
Burn” approval from the EOC director.
4.10.4.4. Interior fire operations should only be attempted if there is high
probability for successful fire stop to a mission essential asset or rescue.
4.10.4.5. Debris, UXOs and other hazards may hinder response. Make every
attempt to stay on the hard surface. If possible, do not drive or walk through
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                       31

contaminated areas, puddles or vapors; find an alternate route. If leaving the
hard surface becomes necessary, use spotters in front of the vehicle to sweep
for UXOs.
4.10.5. Re-attack actions.
4.10.5.1. The SFO must consider ceasing all operations that are not mission
essential.
4.10.5.2. Crews should evaluate the location/status of available cover at every
incident site.
4.10.5.3. At the conclusion of the re-attack, revert to attack recovery actions.
4.10.6. Communications.
4.10.6.1. Plans should be in place in the event the FACC is destroyed.
4.10.6.2. In the event the primary FACC is inoperable, the FACC operator
will re-locate to the alternate FACC.
4.10.6.3. If all communication channels are jammed or inoperative for any
reason, communications between firefighting units will be by any means
available (i.e., portables/mobile radios, alternate frequency, direct lines and
runners, cellular telephones, public address systems, etc).
4.10.6.4. A verification matrix will be distributed to each vehicle to verify
information passed over the radio net. This matrix will be changed if com-
promise is suspected.
4.11. Administration and Logistics.
4.11.1. Vehicle and manpower calculations can be made utilizing the appro-
priate Air Force publications. Shortfalls must be up channeled through the
appropriate authority.
4.11.2. Manpower replacements must be made through PERSCO and coordi-
nated through the commander.
4.11.3. Firefighting equipment and agents may be obtained locally. Quickly
identify shortfalls and request through local established procedures.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                     32

4.11.4. Make sure Supply maintains a sufficient amount of special level stock
items (e.g., bunkers, AFFF, dry chemical, JFIRE, etc).
4.11.5. Consider using local vendors to fill equipment or agent (resources)
shortfalls. Contracting and/or Finance liaison officers may be available for
assistance when using vendor services.
4.11.6. When appropriate add critical contractors to the entry access list i.e.,
HAZMAT clean up companies, fire truck maintenance, etc.
4.11.7. Consider mutual aid agreements when feasible.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                     33

             JFIRE CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS (CONOPS)

5.1. General. The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for utiliz-
ing the JFIRE in CBRN environments.
5.1.1. JFIRE is designed specifically for a wartime mission that allows fire-
fighters to operate in CBRN environments, engage fires, effect rescue and
transition between filtered air and supplied air.
5.1.2. LIMFACS. The firefighter is using two complete protective ensembles
when using the JFIRE, a proximity firefighting suit and a battle dress over-
garment (BDO). This causes increased physical stress for the firefighter. Re-
habilitation after engaging in emergency response is necessary.
5.2. Concepts.
5.2.1. Exterior.
5.2.1.1. The main firefighting objective is to minimize the spread of fire to
exposures, especially those that have a direct impact on the mission. Firefight-
ing is normally accomplished using vehicle turrets or master streams.
5.2.1.2. Firefighters may assume MOPP 4 non-firefighting posture or MOPP 4
firefighting posture as determined by the SFO.
5.2.2. Interior (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health [IDLH] area).
5.2.2.1. Offensive interior operations will only be conducted when necessary
to save mission critical assets or to rescue personnel and will only occur when
directed by the SFO.
5.2.2.2. Prior to entry, the attack crew or incident commander (IC) will an-
nounce that entry is being made. At this time the FACC will acknowledge the
entry and announce “Start the 5-Minute Tick.” The 5-Minute Tick guidelines
are as follows:
5.2.2.2.1. As soon as the attack crew makes entry, a 5-minute countdown will
begin and the FACC will maintain the count. At the 5-minute mark, the FACC
will inform the IC that the 5-Minute Tick has expired. The IC will ensure the
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                        34

interior crews are informed. At this time, communications between the attack
crew and IC become critical. The IC requires a status report that can help
him/her make a tactical decision as to whether or not to continue interior fire
attack.
5.2.2.2.2. At the 10-minute mark, the FACC will again inform the IC and, in
turn, the attack crew. The IC will also advise the interior crew to complete
their task or withdraw at the 15-minute mark.
5.2.2.2.3. At the 15-minute mark, the attack crew may be ordered to withdraw
from the facility for rehabilitation. If there is a delay in withdrawal, the IC will
employ the rapid intervention team (RIT). The RIT can perform other fire
ground duties as long as they do not hinder their primary objective of provid-
ing rescue for the attack team if required.
5.3. Procedures. Complete procedures for employing the JFIRE are contained
in T.O. 14P3-1-181, Joint-Firefighter Integrated Response Ensemble (J-
FIRE).
5.4. Work/Rest Cycles (WRC). WRCs will be enforced for firefighters.
WRC will be at the direction of the IC. As rest cycles do not exclude firefight-
ing activities, priority responses are still likely to be mounting. However, the
IC must consider the WRC when deciding attack modes and fire ground tasks.
Note: Refer to Chapter 8 for further guidance.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                     35

    CONTAMINATION AVOIDANCE AND DECONTAMINATION

6.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for detecting contamination
and subsequent decontamination.
6.2. Detection.
6.2.1. All personnel, vehicles, facilities, shelters and equipment will have M-8
paper/M-9 tape appropriately applied.
6.2.2. All personnel will carry M-8 paper for random sampling of specific
items when necessary.
6.2.3. Notify the FACC when contamination is evident.
6.3. Operational Decontamination.
6.3.1. All dispersal sites should have the materials listed in Table 6.1 on hand
for decontamination.
Table 6.1. Suggested Decontamination Materials for Dispersal Sites.
  Bucket                    Bleach
  Scrubbing brushes         Rags/sponges and/or wiping clothes
  Plastic trash bags        M291/M295 kit
  Bug sprayer               Decontamination mitt
  Plastic bags              Rubber bands to seal self-contained breathing
                            apparatus (SCBA) bottle connections
6.3.2. When contamination is suspected:
6.3.2.1. Report M-8 paper/M-9 tape readings to the FACC. Decontamination
efforts should be limited to those actions necessary to meet mission require-
ments. Always minimize the risk of exposure and contact hazard to personnel
and equipment.
6.3.2.2. When directed, contaminated personnel should report to a CCA for
decontamination. All dispersal sites should be located so that the topography
channels contaminated water away from the immediate area.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                    36

6.3.2.3. For minor contamination, spot decontamination procedures should be
accomplished. Contaminated material should be placed in plastic bags for
appropriate disposal.
6.3.2.4. For gross contamination, use bleach and water solution to decontami-
nate.
6.3.3. CCA Procedures. Follow applicable checklist in Attachment 9, A.9.1.
6.4. Barrier Material.
6.4.1. Calculate how much barrier material will be required to protect critical
assets from chemical deposition.
6.4.2. Cover critical assets when directed by leadership IAW procedures listed
in AFMAN 10-100 and follow local procedures after a chemical attack.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                       37

                     DISPERSAL SITE PROCEDURES

7.1. General. Dispersal management is a means of physically tracking and
protecting assets at dispersal sites.
7.2. Dispersal Site Procedures.
7.2.1. The oncoming shift crew will ensure items are inventoried at shift
change. Annotate results and pass the information to the FACC.
7.2.2. Arrange resources to enhance their accessibility in shelters.
7.2.3. Dispersal sites should not be within 300 feet of a priority facility.
7.2.4. Terrain and prevailing winds should be considered when harden-
ing/splinter protecting dispersal sites.
7.3. General Considerations.
7.3.1. Only one ARFF or structural vehicle should be dispersed to the same
location. Tone down and properly mark all vehicles for chemical detection
and avoidance.
7.3.2. Separate vehicles housed in the station as much as possible.
7.3.3. Arrange dispersal points so that not more than two sites are in a straight
target line.
7.3.4. Disperse one ARFF vehicle so that it has a view of the active runway.
7.3.5. Firefighters will ensure vehicles and equipment are protected from di-
rect attack. Each vehicle will be equipped with a first aid kit,
UXO/contamination marking kit and an operational decontamination kit.
7.3.6. Contamination avoidance techniques will be utilized. All assets will be
splinter protected, covered in plastic and marked with chemical detection ma-
terial.

                                  Chapter 8
           HEAT EXHAUSTION AND WORK/REST CYCLES

8.1. Introduction. This section establishes guidance for making decisions on
firefighter WRCs while operating in JFIRE ensembles. Successfully function-
ing in a contingency environment depends on understanding the factors con-
tributing to heat stress, knowing and implementing the preventive measures,
and maintaining constant observation of personnel for risk factors and signs of
heat illness.
8.2. Responsibilities. All personnel will become familiar with the provisions
of this section. All personnel should drink as much as possible and stay hy-
drated, during all MOPP conditions. Beware of existing climatic conditions
and prepare and react accordingly. The SFO can alter these procedures if ne-
cessary.
8.2.1. SFO. The SFO will consider the circumstances of each incident and
make adequate provisions early in the incident for a WRC, or rest and rehabil-
itation, for all personnel operating at the scene.
8.2.2. Crew Chiefs. All crew chiefs will maintain awareness of the condition
of each member operating within their span of control and ensure adequate
steps are taken to provide for each member’s safety and health.
8.2.3. Firefighters. All firefighters should remain aware of the health and safe-
ty of other crew members.
8.3. Terms.
8.3.1. Dehydration. Following the loss of sweat, water must be consumed to
replace the body’s loss of fluids. If the body fluid lost through sweating is not
replaced, dehydration will follow. Whenever consumption of water fails to
keep up with output of sweat, the body will become progressively dehydrated.
Thirst is a poor indicator of dehydration. Dehydration is possible without any
signs of thirst; mental and physical performance can degrade so slowly that
individuals may not recognize the problem in themselves or others.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                     39

8.3.2. Heat Exhaustion. This condition appears as marked fatigue and weak-
ness, nausea, dizziness, fainting, vomiting, elevated body temperature, and
disorientation. Factors that compound heat exhaustion are lack of acclimatiza-
tion and failure to replace water lost in sweat.
8.3.3. Heat Stroke. This is a medical emergency that is caused when the body
stops sweating, leading to loss of evaporative cooling and a dangerous rise in
core temperature. It can include all of the signs and symptoms of heat exhaus-
tion, but is more severe and can be fatal. One heat casualty is usually followed
by others.
8.3.4. IPE. Insulating effects of IPE occur even when ambient temperature and
humidity are relatively low. Variations to MOPP levels, such as opening or
removing the jacket, or removing some or all of the firefighter proximity
clothing, will reduce barriers to body cooling. Therefore, the SFO must con-
duct risk analyses to balance performing mission critical tasks, casualties due
to actual CBRN threat, and degraded performance due to heat stress, dehydra-
tion, and bulkiness of the protective equipment.
8.3.5. Acclimatization. Un-acclimated personnel are those who have not built
up a tolerance for working in a hot environment. They will experience de-
graded mental and physical performance and be highly susceptible to heat
illness.
8.3.6. Physical Condition. Persons who are overweight or are poorly condi-
tioned become fatigued more easily and do not adjust to working in excessive
climatic conditions as quickly as those in good physical condition. Overweight
and fatigue also impair the body’s heat exchanging mechanisms.
8.4. Heat Illness Prevention.
8.4.1. The key to preventing heat illness and sustaining performance is know-
ledge of preventive measures. Utilize the heat stress index tables in Table 8.1
for general guidance. Be aware these tables require temperature/humidity lev-
el input from a competent authority such as the weather flight for complete
accuracy.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                              40

8.4.2. Water is critical for maintaining health and individual performance,
since the human body is highly dependent on water to cool itself in a hot envi-
ronment. All water consumed must be from a medically approved source to
prevent waterborne illnesses. All personnel should ensure there is an adequate
supply of drinking water protected from biological and chemical fallout at
each dispersal site. Canteens must be kept full; ensure individuals are trained
on the proper techniques to fill canteens in a contaminated environment.
8.4.3. Increased sweating requires additional water consumption. As men-
tioned earlier, thirst alone is not a good indicator of adequate fluid intake. Per-
sonnel always need to drink before they feel thirsty. They must drink small
amounts of water frequently rather than drink large amounts occasionally.
When IPE is worn in an extreme heat environment, water requirements are
more than 20 quarts per day.
8.5. WRC. To prevent a dangerous increase in body temperature, heat produc-
tion must be minimized by reducing work pace and increasing rest periods. In
very hot and humid conditions, reducing the duration of physical activity may
be the only way to prevent dangerous increases in body temperature. WRC
recommendations, as advised by AFMAN 10-100, are provided in Table 8.2.
This table is to be used by the SFO when determining fire crew WRCs.
8.5.1. Allow personnel to seek relief periodically from potentially dangerous
heat stress situations by resting in shaded or air conditioned areas (vehicle
cabs), and by removing IPE and firefighter PPE. Rotating dispersed crews to
the station for rest/rehabilitation will assist in affecting this means.
8.5.2. Even moderate exertion in MOPP gear can cause heat illness at lower
Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) indices. When IPE is worn, add 10° F
to the measured WBGT index.
8.5.3. Avoid resting directly on the hot ground. The ground heated by the sun
can be 30-45 degrees hotter than the air.

 Notes:
 1. WRC recommendations are based on personnel who are fully acclima-
 tized, optimally conditioned, hydrated and rested.
 2. If IPE/firefighter PPE is worn, add 10 deg F to the WBGT index.
 3. Water intake shown supports WRCs. When WRCs cannot be applied due
 to mission critical requirements such as firefighting in support of sortie
 generation, add 1/2 to 1 more quarts per hour to values shown in table.
 4. This guidance is not a substitute for common sense and experience; the
 appearance of heat casualties is a sure sign that the safe limit of work time
 has been exceeded and/or water consumption is inadequate.

           FIRE RESPONSE DURING ALARM CONDITIONS

9.1. General. This section establishes procedures for actions to be taken under
alarm conditions of yellow, black and red/blue. FES actions when under attack
require determining, within certain guidelines, the amount of firefighters and
apparatus to respond to incidents. This section should be used to supplement
locally developed checklists.
9.2. Alarm Yellow.
9.2.1. Implement MOPP as directed by the installation commander.
9.2.2. Conduct fire response as directed by the SFO.
9.3. Alarm Red/Blue.
9.3.1. Implement MOPP 4 or as directed by the installation commander.
9.3.2. If Alarm Red or Blue is declared, it is imperative that firefighters know
what type of attack is occurring (e.g., tactical ballistic missile, aircraft, or spe-
cial operations forces). The FACC or SFO must notify fire crews by radio of
the type of attack. Firefighter actions based on the type of attack are as fol-
lows:
9.3.2.1. Tactical Ballistic Missile (TBM). Firefighters dispersed around the
base will remain in their fire vehicles and assume directed MOPP. This action
is based upon the concept that a TBM is not guided and has no predetermined
target prior to launch. If a hardened facility or overhead shelter for the vehicle
is nearby, it should be utilized. Personnel outside their fire vehicle during at-
tack and unable to expeditiously return to their vehicle should seek shelter in
the nearest hardened facility or overhead cover. Avoid the following locations:
9.3.2.1.1. Within 500 feet of aircraft.
9.3.2.1.2. Within 1,000 feet of POL or munitions storage facilities.
9.3.2.2. Aircraft Attack. Firefighters dispersed around the base will imme-
diately exit their fire vehicle, seek shelter in a pre-constructed personnel
bunker or hardened facility, and assume the directed MOPP. This action is
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                        44

based upon the concept that attack aircraft have the ability to see targets on the
ground. Avoid the following locations:
9.3.2.2.1. Inside/beneath fire trucks or any other vehicle.
9.3.2.2.2. Within 300 feet of a priority facility.
9.3.2.2.3. Within 500 feet of aircraft.
9.3.2.2.4. Within 1000 feet of POL or munitions storage facilities.
9.3.2.3. Special Operations Forces (SOF). Firefighters dispersed around the
base will first determine where the SOF attack is occurring in relation to their
location. Firefighters in close proximity to attack will either establish defen-
sive fighting positions or leave the immediate area as soon as possible if it is
safe to do so. Firefighters not in the SOF attack sector will monitor radio
transmissions and be prepared to react if their sector becomes involved. Fire
fighting activities should not be conducted in the attack area until it is declared
secure by security forces.
9.3.3. Movement of FES vehicles during Alarm Red/Blue conditions will only
be accomplished with direct authority of the SFO and EOC director. Unless
directed, fire crews will remain in place during Alarm Red/Blue until told to
proceed. Firefighters must remain vigilant for any attack related threat or
damage to themselves and the installation. Any such threat noted will be ra-
dioed to the SFO for broadcast to other firefighters (use the SALUTE method
of reporting as outlined in the Airman’s Manual).
9.4. Alarm Black.
9.4.1. Implement MOPP 4 or as directed by the installation commander.
9.4.2. Following the declaration of Alarm Black by the EOC, firefighters are
required to take an array of actions. First and foremost is to ensure the crew is
not injured or otherwise affected by the attack. After determining the status of
the crew, firefighters will report their status to the FACC. A thorough sweep
of the immediate dispersal site is imperative. Crews should concentrate on
those areas that could jeopardize their response to emergencies or their safety.
All vehicles moving during Alarm Black must be coordinated and approved
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                     45

by the EOC director. Crews will not move their vehicle unless directed by the
SFO.
9.4.3. When performing standby duty, firefighters must be prepared to react to
any given wartime scenario in case an Alarm Black is declared. Concerns such
as condition of response routes to the standby, existing UXO and hostilities in
the standby area must be addressed. Once on scene, full attention to the stand-
by is paramount. Fire crews must be ready to react to any possible situations
requiring their assistance. The following are two standby scenarios and actions
to be taken during wartime standby situations.
9.4.3.1. There may be times when fire crews will have to perform standby
while remaining at their dispersal location. Two examples of this situation are
when there might be simultaneous standby requirements or when crews have
been directed to remain in their dispersal location by the SFO. Fire crews will
confirm the standby location and select the best possible response route based
on current base situational reports of UXO, bomb craters and other response
route factors. Crews must be prepared to respond in the appropriate MOPP
condition and firefighting posture. Visual confirmation of standby from the
dispersal site is most desired if possible. If this is not possible, crews will
coordinate with maintenance control through the FACC.
9.4.3.2. The most desirable location for firefighters to perform standby opera-
tions is as close to the area as possible with an unobstructed view of the area.
Crews must be prepared to respond should anything happen during the stand-
by. Firefighters must locate an appropriate area to seek cover (e.g., hardened
aircraft shelters [HAS] or other appropriate “safe areas”) should re-attack oc-
cur during the standby. If no adequate cover is available, firefighters will re-
main in their vehicle during a TBM attack and will exit the vehicle for protec-
tion during an aircraft attack. SOF attacks will be dealt with in one of two
ways: firefighters will either return fire to combat SOF or leave the immediate
area as soon as possible.
9.4.3.3. Ops-tempo may increase to the point where fire resources may not be
available to meet established fire protection standards. When this occurs, im-
plement ORM; consider optimum positioning of fire equipment, limiting air-
craft maintenance or changing hours, etc.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                   46

9.4.3.4. SFO should utilize T.O. 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and
Static Grounding/Bonding, for fire protection standby operation requirements.
9.5. Observing MOPP.
9.5.1. Firefighters will not reduce MOPP level until validated and directed by
the SFO.
9.5.2. M-9 tape or simulated tape will not be applied to firefighter proximity
gear.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                    47

10.5.5. Extra caution and safety applies to driver operators while maneuvering
in cantonment areas. These areas are massed with personnel and many times
are poorly lit during nighttime hours.
10.6. Efficiency. Conservation of fuel and agent must be strictly observed.
10.7. Vehicle Maintenance, Repair and Refueling.
10.7.1. Major discrepancies that effect the vehicle operation will be reported
to the FACC immediately.
10.7.2. Where possible, fire truck maintenance will be dispatched to the ve-
hicle’s location. If FES mechanics are not available, submit a request for
maintenance support. Firefighters must have knowledge of minor repairs.
10.7.3. Refueling will be accomplished at dispersal points when possible.
10.8. Vehicle Kits. All vehicles will maintain the following kits:
10.8.1. First Aid Kit.

should be able to serve as a backup for status boards, visual aids, and charts in
the event of FACC relocation.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                       51

                                  Chapter 12
  RADIO COMMUNICATIONS, PROCEDURES, AND DISCIPLINE

12.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures when utilizing radios as a
means of communication. Radio communication procedures and discipline
may be defined as the process of maintaining clear, decisive, open channels of
communication with as little confusion and repetition as possible.
12.2. Transmissions.
12.2.1. Speak in plain language saying what you mean, i.e., unit responding,
on location, in service, etc.
12.2.2. Vehicles may be assigned letter designation IAW their real world ve-
hicle radio call sign (e.g., Crash 10 will become Charlie 10). Also, designators
for A and B shift may be employed (e.g., Alpha or Bravo 10). Vehicles will
use these letter designations as call signs. Personnel may be assigned letter
designations also (e.g., Bravo-10; 1, 2, and 3). An alternative to this is to code
name the vehicle (e.g., Jackpot) and designate the personnel as 1, 2, and 3
(CC, DO, back-seater).
12.3. Authentication Matrix. Authentication matrix should be used to verify
radio transmissions. All personnel should update their matrix as codes are
used.
12.4. Duress Signal.
12.4.1. Firefighters under duress should communicate the assigned duress
words to the FACC followed by as much information as possible (i.e., loca-
tion, and nature of problem, injuries, etc.). Firefighters will then wait for di-
rection from FACC or SFO.
12.4.2. If a firefighter under duress is unable to orally transmit a duress mes-
sage, a secondary means should be established.
12.5. Discipline. Radio transmissions are reserved for pertinent communica-
tions only. General conversation and chit-chat must be avoided to keep vital
channels open and prevent efforts to locate dispersed units through tracking
devices.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                       52

    SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS AIR SUPPLY

13.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for SCBA air supply oper-
ations.
13.2. Refilling.
13.2.1. SCBA cylinders will not be filled while potential CBRN contamina-
tion conditions exist.
13.2.2. SCBA cylinders will be filled by qualified personnel only. A bottle fill
log will be used with annotations denoting bottle number, date filled and fire-
fighter’s printed name and signature.
13.3. Decontamination.
13.3.1. If M-8 or M-9 paper shows contamination, attempt to decontaminate
the breathing air equipment cover before removing.
13.3.2. Dispose of the contaminated cover at an appropriate disposal site.
13.4. Breathing Air Re-servicing.
13.4.1. All cylinders requiring servicing are filled during attack preparation.
Plastic caps/covers will be put on spare bottles to keep contaminants out.
13.4.2. Disperse as many spare bottles as possible with vehicles. The air filtra-
tion system and associated equipment will be stored in a suitable shelter and
covered with plastic.
13.4.3. The air compressor intake valves and filters will be covered and taped
closed. The air filtration system will be sealed in plastic. M8/M9 chemical
detection paper will be affixed to the top and sides of air compressors to aid in
identification and contamination avoidance.
13.4.4. Additional filter sets for the purification system will be stored in plas-
tic bags.
13.4.5. SCBA re-servicing will not be conducted during an ALARM condition
where there is a potential chemical presence.
AFH 32-2005 15 July 2009                                                       53

14.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures in the event of utility out-
ages.
14.2. Water. When water services are interrupted, every effort should be
made to conserve water. Out of service hydrants should be annotated on all
maps. Crews should re-supply vehicles as necessary utilizing existing EWS
systems.
14.3. Sewage. When sewage service is interrupted, all personnel should make
efforts to not over tax the waste treatment plant, or drains tied to the plant, by
dumping excess water from firefighting operations or decontamination efforts
into the system.
14.4. Telephone. When telephone services are interrupted, communication
must be made by runner, radio or field phone/cell phone.
14.5. Gas. When gas service is interrupted, all units should be notified. In the
event of a fire or gas leak, FES should make efforts to contain or terminate the
fire or leak. It may become necessary to shut-off other facility utilities to pre-
vent fire or damage.
14.6. Electrical. When electrical service is interrupted to the FACC, auxiliary
power should be utilized. Consideration for finding an alternative electrical
source to recharge batteries and portable devices should take immediate
priority if the auxiliary power source fails (i.e., generator on vehicles).
14.7. Radio Service. It may become necessary to align vehicles in the field to
act as repeaters for long distance transmissions. The FACC or SFO will man-
age this coordination on the scene.

15.1. General. This chapter describes unique fire prevention and inspection
issues to consider when operating in a contingency environment.
15.2. Standards compliance. As with firefighter occupational safety and
health and all aspects of fire emergency services, our goal is to meet the same
criteria at deployed locations as we do at home. However; this is not practical
for example when operating at locations for short durations and using expe-
dient construction methods. On the other hand once a location becomes “en-
during; fire chiefs must consider adhering to established criteria as outlined in
DoDIs, AFIs, Unified Facility Criteria, Engineering Technical Letters, NFPA
codes, and other relevant engineering and prevention documents.

 Note:
 1. Once vehicles reach their dispersal sites, a crew status check is to be
 accomplished. When status of crews is reported, the FACC will update the
 appropriate work centers. Also, dispersal sites (tools and equipment, EWS,
 etc.) will be inspected/annotated for damage/contamination after every at-
 tack. This will be done at the first available opportunity and coordinated by
 the A/C.
 2. Vehicles will be maintained in the station and simulated dispersed for
 real-world commitments.

                FIRE EMERGENCY SERVICES GUIDE
               FOR AUXILIARY FIREFIGHTING TEAMS

A7.1. At contingency locations, it is likely that firefighters will be engaged in
mission essential FES tasks involving aircraft and weapon systems. In such
situations, firefighters may be unable to respond to incidents involving lesser
priorities as listed in base emergency management plans. Therefore, fire pre-
vention training becomes crucial so non-firefighting personnel can intervene
early to extinguish small fires.
A7.2. Chapter 5 in AFPAM 10-219, Volume 3, provides additional informa-
tion for auxiliary firefighting tactics and training. The following checklist pro-
vides a brief overview of fire fighting actions.
Table A7.1. Auxiliary Firefighting.
     GENERAL FIREFIGHTING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES
  Know location & operation of fire extinguishers prior to needing them.
  Fight small fires within limitations of extinguisher & personal training.
  Always operate using buddy system; work in teams.
  Maintain fire escape route to your back and never allow fire to get be-
   tween you & your way out.
 For auxiliary firefighters trained to utilize fire hoses/nozzles and fire
   pumps, always perform within the realms of your training.
 Always remember, if fire gets out of control, evacuate & try to contain
   fire to building from outside. Limit spread of fire to adjacent structures.
                     BASIC FIREFIGHTING METHODS
    Type                                     Methods
Fire             Preventing fires is always the best line of defense.
Prevention
Structural       Do not enter a burning building to fight a fire.
Fire             If fire is found in early stages of development, the appropri-
                  ate fire extinguisher can extinguish the fire.

                    BASIC FIREFIGHTING METHODS
   Type                                     Methods
Structural      Auxiliary firefighters with proper training can utilize hose
Fire (cont.)     streams from exterior in order to control the spread of fire.
Vehicle         A fuel fire can be put out with a portable fire extinguisher.
Fire            Do not allow flowing fuel to flow towards you.
                Do not stand in puddles of fuel.
                If fuel tank has ruptured, do not attempt to fight the fire.
                Remove exposures if this can be done safely.
Electrical      Never use water on an electrical fire.
Fire            Attempt to de-energize at main breaker or pulling fuses.
                Only use type C fire extinguishers.
Gas Fire        Turn gas off at shut-off valve and fight fire as a structural or
(Natural/        tent fire.
Propane)        Do extinguish the fire prior to removing the fuel source.
Tent Fire       Fire spreads with alarming speed in a tent fire and can be
                 very dangerous.
                Drop all tents in the immediate area and wet all tents down
                 if water is available.
Ground          Utilize shovels, rakes, fire brooms, etc.

 If CAM bar readings are the same upon remonitoring, take
 the following emergency steps:
 1. Immediately stop CCA operations.
 2. Monitor surrounding area within the VHA to verify levels and
     look for any potential hot spots.
 3. If hot spots are found decontaminate by using decontamination
     kits, washing down area with 5% chlorine solution, sealing, re-
     moving, covering etc.
 4. Once levels are below the ones listed in the CAM Monitoring
     Chart, continue CCA operations
 5. If levels have not changed
     - Check serviceability of CAMs. Replace as necessary and re-
        monitor area.
     - Verify wind direction. Ensure you are still downwind or
        crosswind. If not, the CCA must be relocated to an upwind
        or crosswind location.
