This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 16-6, International Arms
Control and Nonproliferation Agreements, and the DoD Foreign Clearance Program, and
Department of Defense (DoD) Directive (DoDD) 2060.1, Implementation of, and Compliance
with Arms Control Agreements, by providing guidance directly associated with Air Force
implementation of, and compliance with, the Treaty Between the United States of America and
the Russian Federation on Measures for Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive
Arms, otherwise known as the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty or the New START Treaty
(NST). It applies to all Air Force organizations (including Air National Guard and Air Force
Reserve) responsible for implementing and complying with arms control agreements,
specifically those organizations involved with the hosting of NST inspections at Air Force
facilities, those organizations responsible for providing NST-mandated notifications, those
organizations that provide logistics support to the U.S. and foreign NST inspection teams, and
those organizations responsible for protecting U.S. Air Force equities from the vulnerabilities
associated with the NST implementation and verification regime. This Air Force Instruction
(AFI) may be supplemented by subordinate organizations, but all supplements must be routed to
AF/A5XP for coordination prior to certification and approval. The authorities to waive
wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”)
number following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
Management, Table 1.1 for a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers.
Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver
approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items. This
Instruction is consistent with AFPD 13-5, Air Force Nuclear Enterprise, and Air Force priorities
for the Nuclear Enterprise. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to
the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for
 2                                                                                         AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014


Change of Publication; route AF Form 847 from the field through appropriate chain of
command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication
are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in
accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This Instruction is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The previous
version’s publication preceded the entry into force of New START. This revision modifies
language to reflect current NST implementation activities and the updated roles and
responsibilities for each Air Force organization responsible for implementing and complying
with arms control agreements. This version also eliminates language provided solely for the
preparation of NST entry into force.

This revision updates AFI 16-608 IAW AFI 33-360 (see Table "Tier Waiver Authorities"),
refining Wing-level duty requirements and identifying the waiver authority for these
requirements.

                                            Chapter 1

                                           OVERVIEW

1.1. General.
     1.1.1. This document is UNCLASSIFIED.
     1.1.2. Strict adherence to New START Treaty (NST) requirements and use of standard
     operating procedures for NST activities is paramount.
     1.1.3. The New START Treaty (NST) and its associated Protocol and Annexes are the
     primary references for addressing questions related to compliance. In cases where
     clarification is required, guidance shall be requested from Headquarters Air Force (HAF)
     Strategic Plans and Policy Division (AF/A5XP). Units at all levels will adhere to NST
     requirements. (T-0; see AFI 33-360, Table 1.1, for Tier approval information).
     1.1.4. This document will be reviewed by the OPR at a minimum of every four years per
     AFI 33-360. (T-1)
     1.1.5. This guidance describes processes, provides procedural guidance, and specifies
     Headquarters, Major Command (MAJCOM), and unit responsibilities for implementation of
     and compliance with the NST. This includes coordination and execution of inspections,
     training, financial oversight, reporting, and utilization of assets and personnel.
     1.1.6. The NST-declared AF facilities referenced in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 are subject to NST
     inspections. (T-0)
     1.1.7. Affected MAJCOMs (see paragraph 3.2.) will develop supplements, implementation,
     or compliance plans and procedures to execute this guidance and coordinate plans and
     procedures with Air Staff. (T-0)
1.2. Introduction.
     1.2.1. The NST entered into force on 5 February 2011 and has a duration of ten years. It
     may be extended for a period of no more than five years by mutual agreement of the Parties.
     1.2.2. The purpose of the Treaty is to increase transparency and mutual trust, enhance
     predictability and stability, and to reduce and limit the strategic offensive arms, and their
     associated warheads, of both the United States and the Russian Federation. Although the
     Treaty does not define the term “strategic offensive arms,” “strategic" indicates that the
     forces covered are those of intercontinental range. "Offensive" is in contrast to defensive in
     nature, such as ballistic missile defense systems. The Treaty requires the Parties to mutually
     and transparently reduce their nuclear forces over a period of seven years, but allows each
     Party the flexibility to determine its own force structure.
     1.2.3. The NST established the following central limits:
        1.2.3.1. 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), deployed submarine-
        launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and deployed heavy bombers;
        1.2.3.2. 1550 warheads on deployed ICBMs and SLBMs and nuclear warheads counted
        for deployed heavy bombers;
AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                       5


      1.2.3.3. 800 deployed and non-deployed ICBM launchers, deployed and non-deployed
      SLBM launchers, and deployed and non-deployed heavy bombers.
   1.2.4. The first and second central limits are intended to limit the deployed strategic forces
   of each Party. Deployed delivery vehicles are ICBMs in launchers, SLBMs in launch tubes
   and nuclear equipped heavy bombers. The third central limit is intended to limit the ability
   to “break out” of the Treaty limits by constraining the number of non-deployed ICBM and
   SLBM launchers and non-deployed heavy bombers. Non-deployed launchers are empty
   ICBM and SLBM launchers and test silos, and non-deployed heavy bombers are test heavy
   bombers and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments located at repair or production
   facilities.
   1.2.5. Air Force warheads counted against the central limits of the Treaty include all reentry
   vehicles (nuclear and conventional) emplaced on Minuteman III (MM III) ICBMs. Each
   deployed heavy bomber equipped for nuclear armaments under the NST counts as a single
   warhead against the central limits.
   1.2.6. Existing weapons systems shall be operated in a manner consistent with NST
   obligations. This shall be done in a Joint manner to support the Commander, U.S. Strategic
   Command and to ensure that the number of accountable items remain within the NST central
   limits. (T-0)
1.3. New START Treaty Verification.
   1.3.1. Verification of the NST will be carried out using on-site inspections, national
   technical means (NTM) of verification, unique identifiers (UID), data exchanges, and
   notifications.
   1.3.2. On-Site Inspections. Each Party may conduct up to 18 on-site inspections each treaty
   year. These inspections are divided into two groups.
      1.3.2.1. Type One Inspections. Type One inspections are conducted at the operating
      bases for ICBMs, ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), and nuclear-capable heavy
      bombers and focus on both deployed and non-deployed strategic arms. Each Party is
      allowed to conduct up to ten Type One inspections each treaty year.
      1.3.2.2. Type Two Inspections. Type Two inspections are focused on non-deployed
      strategic arms and conducted at facilities such as storage sites, test ranges, and conversion
      or elimination facilities. Type Two inspections may also be used to confirm the
      conversion and elimination of strategic offensive arms and to determine whether
      eliminated facilities are being used for purposes inconsistent with the Treaty. Each party
      is allowed to conduct up to eight Type Two inspections each treaty year.
   1.3.3. National Technical Means. The use of NTM (e.g., reconnaissance satellites)
   supplements on-site inspections to monitor compliance with treaty provisions. The NST
   precludes Parties from interfering with NTM or using methods of concealment that might
   impede verification via NTM.
   1.3.4. Unique Identifiers. Each deployed and non-deployed ICBM, SLBM, and heavy
   bomber subject to the Treaty is required to be labeled with a unique alpha-numeric identifier
   visible to the inspecting party.
 6                                                              AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014


     1.3.5. Data Exchange. The Treaty requires the Parties to exchange aggregate data on their
     strategic offensive arms and related facilities 45 days after entry into force (EIF) and
     biannually thereafter.
     1.3.6. Notifications. The Treaty obligates each Party to provide notifications related to
     changes to data contained in the NST database, movement of accountable items, inspection
     activities, changes in deployed/nondeployed status, conversion or elimination activities, and
     ICBM/SLBM launches.
1.4. New START Treaty Accountable Systems and Facilities.
     1.4.1. Air Force facilities directly affected by the NST include those designated as NST
     points of entry (POE), ICBM Bases, Air Bases, Storage Facilities, ICBM Repair Facilities,
     Conversion or Elimination Facilities, Test Ranges and Formerly Declared Facilities (FDF).
     The NST also indirectly impacts other declared facilities. Air Force weapon systems directly
     impacted by the NST include ICBMs, ICBM launchers, and heavy bombers.
     1.4.2. Article III of the NST lists existing types of strategic offensive arms at the time of
     treaty signature. Since then, the Air Force has removed some systems from accountability.
     Table 1.1 below lists accountable Air Force weapons systems as of the date of this AFI
     publication.

Table 1.1. Existing Types of Accountable Air Force Weapons Systems*

 * The Minuteman II (MM II) ICBM, B-52G heavy bomber, and B-1B
 heavy bomber were initially listed as existing types, but are no longer
 accountable under the Treaty. Although B-1B heavy bombers no
 longer count toward the Treaty limits, they remain subject to Type Two
 inspections.

     1.4.3. At EIF, the Air Force declared 14 facilities subject to on-site inspections under NST.
     A list of these facilities shall be updated according to Part Two of the Protocol to the NST.
1.4.3.1. Table 1.2. lists Air Force facilities that are currently subject to Type One inspections.

   However, the NST has provisions for declaring new types of strategic offensive arms and
   new facilities during the duration of the Treaty, as required.
   1.4.6. The NST includes provisions for exchanging numerical and technical data concerning
   treaty-accountable items and activities concerning their placement and posture, as well as
   exhibitions, inspections, and demonstrations to assist in the verification of exchanged data.

   requirements by interfacing with the wing/unit TCO.
   3.4.5. By directing all MAJCOM TCO inputs to the wing/unit TCO, the treaty team is
   assured of having a single base point of contact for working issues and requesting support.
   3.4.6. MAJCOM TCOs shall not interfere with the DTRA Escort Team’s role in the treaty
   compliance process and shall not interact with Russian inspectors unless specifically
   requested to do so by the DTRA Escort Team Chief.
   3.4.7. MAJCOM TCOs, if present at an inspected facility during an NST escort mission,
   shall not directly represent USG, DoD or Air Force positions to either the DTRA Escort
   Team or to Russian inspection team members during the execution of the NST escort
   mission, including cultural activities, unless the MAJCOM TCO is acting in the capacity of
   the wing/unit TCO, or unless asked by the DTRA Escort Team Chief.
AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                    17


   3.4.8. MAJCOM TCOs must have a current understanding of existing USG, DoD, and Air
   Force positions/guidance relating to the hosting of NST activities on U.S. territory.
   3.4.9. If questions arise, the MAJCOM TCO should coordinate with their chain of command
   and/or AF/A5XP for clarification. The MAJCOM TCO will advise the wing/unit TCO with
   responses to communicate to the DTRA Escort Team Chief.
   3.4.10. Identification and prevention of any prohibited activity when the DTRA Escort Team
   and Russian inspection team members are at an inspectable Air Force facility during an NST
   escort mission shall be in accordance with USG, DoD and/or Air Force guidance and shall be
   the responsibility of the DTRA Escort Team, supported by the wing/unit TCO, in direct
   support of treaty compliance.
   3.4.11. The MAJCOM TCO shall promptly notify his/her chain of command, including
   AF/A5XP, of any prohibited activity reported by his/her wing/unit TCOs during NST
   activities at inspectable Air Force facilities, the circumstances of those activities, and the
   resultant actions taken.
3.5. MAJCOM Arms Control Training and Awareness.
   3.5.1. MAJCOM TCOs will ensure subordinate wing/unit TCOs and MAJCOM personnel
   receive appropriate NST training. Training can be accomplished by attending the Air Force
   Arms Control Overview Course, the ACES-NST Initial User training course, Air Force-level
   NST workshops, utilizing the AF/A5XP Portal Training site, attending MAJCOM-level arms
   control workshops, and by participating in U.S.-only mock inspections and training visits.
   3.5.2. Arms Control Courses. DTRA offers a semi-annual NST orientation course, as well
   as other relevant arms control courses, in the Washington, DC area. MAJCOM and
   wing/unit TCOs are highly encouraged to participate. These courses are announced in
   advance to all MAJCOMs.
   3.5.3. Conduct mock inspections and training visits. U.S.-only mock inspections are
   valuable training activities for the escort mission teams, local base personnel and logistics
   support activities as well as those personnel involved in the notification process. They
   validate operational procedures and base NST Compliance Plans, logistic support
   capabilities, security procedures and hosting responsibilities. They provide opportunities for
   base TCOs and base facilities to operationally train in a near “real-world” environment. Base
   TCOs should strive to make these exercises as “real” as possible; taking time, manpower,
   cost and mission team requests/desires into consideration.
3.6. MAJCOM Resource Management Responsibilities.
   3.6.1. MAJCOM TCOs function as resource managers and monitor arms control funding and
   manpower. Successful execution requires close coordination between MAJCOM TCOs, base
   TCOs, and appropriate financial management counterparts. Budgeting and manpower
   requirements differ from base to base and MAJCOM to MAJCOM. Effective resource
   management is necessary to ensure sufficient funding and proper program execution.
   3.6.2. MAJCOM TCOs act as command resource manager for PE 35145F and they work
   closely with the HAF PEM.
   3.6.3. Resource managers are responsible for managing resources and budgeting funds for
   MAJCOM arms control activities and ensuring MAJCOM wing requirements are included in
 18                                                           AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014


   budget submissions. The MAJCOM treaty office and FM work with the field units to build a
   spend plan.
   3.6.4. AF/A5XP validates the MAJCOM Spend Plan by rationalizing the NST requirements
   within the Air Force arms control budget.
   3.6.5. Unit TCOs provide their requirements to the MAJCOM TCOs, who consolidate these
   requirements and submit them to AF/A5XP. MAJCOM TCOs must ensure that all
   subordinate wing/unit requirements are identified and defended, when necessary.
   3.6.6. MAJCOM TCOs must also ensure that all requirements comply with fiscal
   requirements in the DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R V5, AFI 65-601 V1,
   Budget Guidance and Procedures, and AFI 65-603, Official Representation Funds.
   3.6.7. MAJCOM TCOs are responsible for monitoring manpower authorizations and
   identifying requirements. Most wing, some MAJCOM, and other arms control billet
   authorizations are centrally managed by AF/A5XP. These billets are not under the control of
   MAJCOM planners. Moving or reclassifying a billet requires coordination with and
   concurrence from AF/A5XP. In accordance with AFPD 16-6 and AFI 16-601, MAJCOM
   planners must identify arms control requirements to AF/A5XP sufficient to support
   MAJCOM headquarters and subordinate wing/unit arms control requirements.
3.7. General Wing/Unit Treaty Responsibilities.
   3.7.1. Wing/unit TCOs serve as NST notification originators and ensure unit-originated NST
   notifications comply with all Treaty requirements and are of the highest quality with regard
   to accuracy and timeliness.
      3.7.1.1. All newly-assigned personnel whose duties include the preparation, review or
      transmission of NST notifications must receive local ACES training NLT 90 days from
      being assigned and complete the ACES-NST Initial User training course within 180 days
      of assignment. After the initial local ACES instruction, newly assigned personnel can
      request an ACES account, but will not process notifications without supervision (by an
      individual who has completed formal ACES training) until completing the formal ACES-
      NST Initial User Course. Every effort should be made to complete this training as part of
      a controller's initial training program, prior to certification. (T-2)
      3.7.1.2. TCOs must maintain proficiency in NST Reporting and ACES operation(s) and
      shall take steps to ensure that personnel originating notifications at the Wing/Unit have a
      working knowledge of NST notification requirements and procedures. See NST
      Reporting Workbook for proficiency requirements. (T-2)
   3.7.2. As the local facility expert on the NST, TCOs are required to perform dynamic,
   comprehensive analysis of the impact of NST activities on the base, tenant units, separately
   located facilities, and associated missions. This requires all TCOs to have a detailed
   knowledge of the NST relative to their facilities. In this role, TCOs answer questions
   regarding the NST as well as identify and explain the effect this treaty will or may have on
   the facility’s military and commercial activities. (T-2)
   3.7.3. Duties not directly related to treaty activities shall not be assigned when they directly
   interfere with TCO duties. (T-1)
AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                          19


   3.7.4. Each wing/unit which is host of an NST inspectable facility will have an NST
   compliance plan applicable to that facility. Air Force facilities declared under the NST that
   are not subject to on-site inspections or any NST reporting requirements do not require a
   compliance plan. Wing/unit compliance plans shall be coordinated with their parent
   MAJCOM and MAJCOM will provide to AF/A5XP for review. (T-0)
   3.7.5. The wing/unit NST Compliance Plan shall detail the logistics support to facilitate NST
   inspection activities to ensure all NST timelines are met. (T-2) Suggested components of a
   wing/unit compliance plan are contained in Attachment 2.
3.8. Wing/Unit Exhibition Responsibilities.
   3.8.1. Units hosting NST Exhibitions shall conduct a mock exhibition in coordination with
   AF/A5XP prior to the actual exhibition. (T-2)
   3.8.2. Local units shall provide digital photography services in support of NST Exhibition
   photography requirements. Units shall be capable of producing photographs meeting the
   requirements of Part Five of the Annex on Inspection Activities. (T-0)
   3.8.3. AF/A5XP is responsible for obtaining photographs of all exhibited items and declared
   distinguishing features necessary to support the exhibition prior to the arrival of Russian
   inspectors. Local units shall support AF/A5XP in obtaining such photographs.
3.9. Wing/Unit Inspection Responsibilities.
   3.9.1. Wing Commanders are responsible for ensuring Russian Federation inspection teams
   are afforded their full treaty rights under NST while protecting U.S. national security
   interests. (T-0)
   3.9.2. Wing/Unit TCOs are responsible for facilitating DTRA Escort Teams in fulfilling
   inspection obligations. This involves coordination from a variety of supporting activities
   such as: Base Ops, transportation, dining and billeting, force protection, security and OPSEC
   units, aircraft services (fuel, water, air, de-icing, lavatory, flight meals, and parking), protocol
   and public affairs, medical and recreational services, meeting/conference rooms and
   communications availability, and escorting. Host unit local activities are outlined further in
   Chapter 6.5. (T-2)
   3.9.3. Wing/Unit TCOs should work closely with their base functional POCs to identify
   possible problems and recommend solutions.
   3.9.4. Wing/Units shall make every effort to facilitate ground support to ensure compliance
   with applicable treaty timelines.
   3.9.5. Wing/Unit TCOs should keep the AF/A5XP informed of major base/community
   events that could impact NST inspection operations as soon as possible. Airfield
   maintenance, air shows, exercises, inspections, weather events (e.g., hurricane staging
   support), etc., may limit transportation options, support personnel availability and billeting
   availability and can affect the ability to host NST activities.
   3.9.6. NST inspection activities, by treaty design, are typically short-notice events. TCOs
   may only have 24 hours notification or less that they are required to host a Russian inspection
   team. Routine training of escorts and awareness briefings for wing leadership are a key to
   the success of the event.
 20                                                            AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014


   3.9.7. Upon site designation, the Unit TCO will receive a call from the DTRA Escort Team.
   The Unit TCO shall provide NST-required information to the DTRA Escort Team Chief on
   the number of accountable items located at the inspection site and additional logistical
   information, e.g., arrival time. (T-0)
   3.9.8. No later than one hour after designation of the inspection site, the designated unit’s
   TCO shall ensure that all applicable NST pre-inspection restrictions are implemented. The
   TCO shall notify the DTRA Escort Team Chief immediately if any pre-inspection restriction
   cannot be fulfilled or sustained. (T-0)
   3.9.9. The DTRA Escort Team shall meet in-coming Russian inspectors at the point of entry
   and transport them to the facility designated for inspection. Upon arrival at the airfield
   associated with the inspection site, the inspected unit shall provide local escort support to the
   DTRA escorts. (T-1)
   3.9.10. The DTRA Escort Team Chief serves as the official NST national escort and is
   empowered to interact directly with Russian inspectors. Air Force local escorts will provide
   subject matter expertise to support inspections and ensure Air Force policies and weapons
   system safety rules are observed. Local escort support is outlined further in Chapter 6.6. (T-
   1)
   3.9.11. Disputes concerning inspection activities shall be addressed at the DTRA-local Air
   Force escort level. If local personnel (either wing command/staff or DTRA) are unable to
   resolve disputes, formal resolution shall be requested through AF/A5XP using command
   channels. (T-0)
   3.9.12. The unit TCO shall complete a pre-inspection briefing for the Russian inspection
   team within one hour of the team’s official arrival at the inspected facility. This briefing
   shall provide all NST-required information including annotated site diagrams and will
   include the information required to be provided to the national escorts. (T-0)
   3.9.13. The unit TCO, in coordination with the DTRA Escort Team Chief, shall ensure that
   Russian inspectors and their DTRA escorts are transported to items designated for inspection
   within the timeframes specified in the NST. (T-0)
   3.9.14. The unit, in coordination with the DTRA Escort Team, shall provide continuous
   escort of Russian inspectors at all times. The unit TCO shall coordinate security and counter-
   intelligence support as part of the unit’s compliance plan. (T-1)
3.10. Wing/Unit Education, Training and Exercises.
   3.10.1. Education, training, and mock inspection activities should thoroughly prepare
   facilities for NST inspection activities. They should focus on the timeline for the event,
   providing a timely and accurate pre-inspection briefing, and focus on facility and escort
   responsibilities, safety, OPSEC, and impacts/vulnerabilities to the wing/unit.
   3.10.2. Unit TCOs shall develop and maintain facility training programs that are flexible and
   applicable to specific unit needs and requirements. (T-2)
   3.10.3. Unit TCOs will develop pre-arrival training/security briefs for local escorts. These
   briefs will be approved through the appropriate MAJCOMs and provided to AF/A5XP for
   review. (T-2)
AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   21


                                          Chapter 4

                                        REPORTING

4.1. General.
   4.1.1. Reporting is closely linked to database maintenance and notifications within the NST.
   This requires careful tracking of deployed and non-deployed Air Force treaty-accountable
   assets and scrupulous reporting.
4.2. Notifications.
   4.2.1. MAJCOMs and Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) shall provide notifications IAW Part
   Four of the Protocol and the Annex on Notifications to the Air Force Central Node via
   ACES. Most notifications are passed between the Parties through the established Nuclear
   Risk Reduction Centers. NST has four notifications in the Annex to be employed by
   inspectors while in-country conducting inspections. These will be passed from the Inspectors
   to the DTRA national escorts. In addition, NST contains provisions for the parties to address
   situations where there are no pre-established notifications. Should such situations arise
   during the course of an inspection on an Air Force installation, whether initiated by the
   Russian inspectors or at the behest of the unit, it will be addressed through the established
   command channels and escalation processes. (T-0)
4.3. Database Reporting.
   4.3.1. The NST establishes a database of information concerning items of inspection that the
   Parties exchange twice annually in March and September. NST notifications will be handled
   primarily through the ACES reporting network.
   4.3.2. In addition, some NST notifications require concurrent reporting through separate
   channels to support distinct but complimentary databases. U.S. STRATCOM’s Force
   Status/Readiness (FSR) database is one such system. As such, the TCO and local FSR
   representative will coordinate to ensure that NST force status changes are reflected in the
   same manner in both ACES and FSR, consistent with established reporting procedures.
4.4. Treaty Compliance Officer Reports.
   4.4.1. Post-inspection reports by the unit TCO shall be prepared within seven days following
   an inspection, exhibition, or demonstration. These reports will be forwarded through the
   MAJCOM and provided to AF/A5XP, who will distribute as necessary. (T-2)
4.5. Treaty Compliance Certifications.
   4.5.1. From time-to-time the Secretary of Defense may request Air Force certification of
   compliance with NST. Such requests will subsequently be sent to all MAJCOMs. Each
   MAJCOM will certify command compliance with NST. Certifications will be sent to
   AF/A5XP who will compile them with other required certifications from SAF/AQ and
   SAF/AAZ and combine them into an Air Force certification. The AF/A3/5 will certify Air
   Force operational and acquisition compliance with NST in response to the Secretary of
   Defense.
 22                                                         AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014


4.6. NST Reporting Deviations.
   4.6.1. A reporting deviation is identified as providing incorrect information, or failing to
   provide the required information, in an NST notification format. An example would include
   omitting a reference, or providing an incorrect reference, in an NST Format 3 notification
   regarding the movement of a heavy bomber or ICBM. All NST reporting deviations will be
   managed IAW procedures outlined in the NST Reporting Workbook.
AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                      23


                                           Chapter 5

                                  SAFETY AND SECURITY

5.1. General.
   5.1.1. Compliance with the NST is mandatory. However, such compliance does not
   authorize violations of operational safety or security requirements. Adherence to existing Air
   Force safety and security directives and proper advance planning should prevent situations
   from arising where inspection rights conflict with established procedures. It may be
   necessary to reassess such requirements as a result of the NST and change requirements to
   allow compliance with the NST.
   5.1.2. Should situations arise where inspection rights conflict with established safety and
   security procedures, the unit TCO shall consult with the DTRA Escort Team Chief to resolve
   the situation in such a way as to accommodate NST compliance within the bounds of safety
   and security standards. (T-1)
   5.1.3. Ensuring personnel safety remains the highest priority of all escorts. Safety standards
   will not be relaxed or compromised in the course of inspections.
   5.1.4. OPSEC and COMSEC standards will apply during inspections. The mission of
   inspection escorts is to ensure that compliance with these standards is maintained while
   allowing the inspection team to satisfy their treaty rights. Disagreements on-site will default
   to protecting information until the DTRA Team Chief and unit leadership agree on a process,
   or escalate the matter through the appropriate chain of command for resolution.
   5.1.5. Program Protection Plans and Security Vulnerability Assessments. Commanders will
   ensure that protection plans account for base or facility vulnerabilities associated with NST
   inspection activities. (T-1)
   5.1.6. Security Classification of NST Information. U.S. information provided to inspectors
   during inspections will be classified in accordance with existing DoD classification guidance.
   As a general rule, DoD classified information is not provided to inspectors, however, some
   information when aggregated will become classified. DoD security classification guides will
   regulate sharing.
5.2. Host Unit Security.
   5.2.1. Russian Inspectors have specific diplomatic rights, privileges, and immunities as
   outlined in the Protocol to the NST (Part Five, Section II), and the Vienna Convention on
   Diplomatic Relations of 18 April 1961. The person of the inspector is inviolable, meaning
   for example that he or she can’t be subjected to a pat-down or other search, and is not subject
   to arrest or detention. Inspectors are not subject to U.S. criminal, civil, and administrative
   jurisdiction. Similarly, the Inspectors’ papers, correspondence, and personal property are
   immune from search and seizure in U.S. territory, as is the aircraft transporting the Inspectors
   to and from points of entry.
   5.2.2. The Russian inspection team is greeted by the DTRA Escort Team Chief at the POE.
   Luggage and equipment belonging to the assigned Russian Inspector(s) will include personal
   property and papers which the Treaty protects. At the POE, DTRA and U.S. Customs
 24                                                             AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014


   personnel will identify and distinguish the luggage and equipment belonging to persons who
   do not share the same privileges and immunities. Searches of the visiting Inspectors and/or
   their property are prohibited, and any questions regarding searches shall be directed to the
   DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-0)
   5.2.3. As a courtesy and to avoid revealing security procedure information to the visiting
   team, DTRA Escort Team members, their luggage, and hand-carried items are exempt from
   searches, unless dictated by a specific base security situation (see DOD S-5210.41-
   M_AFMAN 31-108V1, The Air Force Nuclear Weapon Security Manual, DOD S-5210.41-
   M_AFMAN 31-108V2, General Nuclear Weapon Security Procedures, and DOD S-
   5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108V3, Nuclear Weapon Specific Requirements).
   5.2.4. It is Air Force policy that if no specific threat exists against the inspection team or the
   host unit before or during their visit, additional security requirements are neither warranted
   nor appropriate. Treatment of the inspection team as distinguished visitors will be sufficient.
   5.2.5. It is Air Force policy that the local base escort team has the primary responsibility for
   ensuring the protection and safety of inspection team members and for limiting access to
   them by non-essential personnel. (T-1)
   5.2.6. If a threat arises before or during the visit of an inspection team, the host unit will
   react appropriately, inform the DTRA Escort Team Chief (prior to arrival if possible), and
   brief the arriving team of the situation, the precautions they should take, and the protective
   measures being taken by the base. (T-1)
   5.2.7. If a threat exists during an NST activity at a host unit, considerations should be taken
   to billet the inspection team on base and limit/restrict their movement as much as possible,
   depending on the threat. If a credible threat exists to NST activities and movement is
   required to off-base locations, base Security Forces will advise the AFOSI and local law
   enforcement agencies. (T-1)
   5.2.8. If a credible threat exists, treaty activities may be restricted to on-base, with Security
   Forces personnel posted on the boundaries of areas used for lodging, dining, and other treaty
   activities. Off-base activities will require coordination with local law enforcement. This
   information must be passed expeditiously to AF/A5XP. If required, a recommendation to
   consider terminating the inspection and removing the inspectors from the area will be passed
   by the Air Staff to the USG Interagency.
5.3. Operational Security (OPSEC).
   5.3.1. The purpose of OPSEC is to reduce the vulnerability of Air Force missions to
   successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical information. OPSEC applies to all
   activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all phases of operations (see AFI 10-
   701, Operations Security).
   5.3.2. Wing personnel shall ensure vulnerability assessments of their facilities that are
   subject to NST inspections remain current.
   5.3.3. Facility personnel should guard against the possibility that someone may attempt to
   gather information on our abilities, capabilities, operations, intentions, personnel and
   organizations. It is incumbent on facility personnel to be observant and diligent in protecting
AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                   25


  information that might be used to compromise our security, while at the same time being
  courteous and pleasant.
  5.3.4. If inquiries or actions of a Russian inspection team member raise suspicions, the host-
  unit’s escort shall notify the TCO, who shall in turn notify the DTRA Escort Team Chief.
  Base security force representatives and AFOSI shall be notified of any suspicious situations.

       gift exchange to determine the appropriate level of gift and to avoid duplication.
6.5. Host Unit Local Activities.
   6.5.1. Units hosting NST activities may be called upon to support or facilitate leisure time
   activities for members of the inspection team. Creativity, ingenuity, and flexibility on the
   part of the TCO are encouraged. Remember that not all Russian inspectors will speak
   English, so coordination with the DTRA Escort Team Chief for appropriate linguistic
   services is crucial to the success of an activity.
   6.5.2. On-base activities may include, but are not limited to, visits to the Base Exchange
   and/or Commissary, Class Six store, clothing sales, Officer and/or Enlisted Clubs, cafeterias
   and fast food establishments, museums or displays, or other recreational facilities. If the
   Base Exchange and/or Commissary are visited, the TCO will be responsible for crowd
   control and will coordinate with the facility manager to provide a separate check-out lane if
   required. (T-2)
       6.5.2.1. As guests of the U.S., Russian inspection team members will be authorized the
       use of the Base Exchange and Commissary, Class Six store, convenience stores, and
       Officer and/or Enlisted Clubs. At the clothing sales store, only non-issue military
       clothing/items may be purchased. The hosting unit TCO will notify any of these facilities
       prior to the arrival of the inspection team. (T-2)
   6.5.3. Off-base activities include shopping, tourist and recreational activities, etc. Any off-
   base activity, including when the teams are housed off-base, will require notification to
   AFOSI and base Security Forces to ensure appropriate coordination with local, state or
   federal authorities. Off-base security falls under the jurisdiction of the local, state or federal
   authorities, and will not be provided by base security forces. (T-1)
       6.5.3.1. The DTRA Escort Team has primary responsibility for all visiting NST
       personnel during all activities.
       6.5.3.2. If requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief, the TCO may provide, as
       available, local base escorts and drivers to facilitate movement off-base.
6.6. Local (Base) Escorts.
   6.6.1. Local escorts are necessary to assist the DTRA Escort Team and to facilitate NST
   activities/events when Russian inspectors are visiting their base.
   6.6.2. Local escorts shall be site-knowledgeable base representatives designated as points of
   contact for the DTRA Escort Team.
 28                                                             AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014


   6.6.3. Host units will provide local escorts to support NST activities. Local escorts will
   report to the TCO and be relieved of all other assigned responsibilities while performing
   escort duties associated with NST activities. (T-2)
6.7. Medical and Dental Support / Mortuary Services.
   6.7.1. Host units are expected to provide or arrange for emergency/non-elective
   medical/dental care as necessary and as requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief for
   inspection and/or escort team members to accomplish their duties, to save lives or to stabilize
   injuries. Military treatment facilities shall be used unless competent medical authority deems
   otherwise. (T-2)
   6.7.2. If transportation to a local civilian medical facility is required, the host unit’s medical
   escort will accompany the individual r and the DTRA escort and stay with them at the local
   facility until care is rendered. The host unit should be prepared to accommodate a national
   escort (DTRA) to accompany the individual should evacuation be necessary. The military
   medical staff will coordinate care with the civilian facility as required. The DTRA Escort
   Team Chief shall be kept apprised of the patient’s condition and treatment at all times. (T-2)
   6.7.3. Transportation to an appropriate Point of Exit (POX), if required, shall be
   accomplished via usual air evacuation procedures after coordination with the DTRA Escort
   Team Chief and Russian Inspection Team Chief. (T-2)
   6.7.4. Arrangements for mortuary services shall be in accordance with Air Force regulations,
   local and state laws, foreign preferences, and in coordination with the DTRA Escort Team
   Chief. (T-0)
   6.7.5. All medical care provided by USAF through military personnel or facilities to a non-
   U.S. citizen affiliated with NST inspection activities shall be billed according to any relevant
   agreements with the sending state, to the extent these are in effect where the care was
   provided. Any medical care not covered by agreement with the sending state shall be billed
   to DTRA. (T-1)
6.8. Lodging and Dining.
   6.8.1. Host unit TCOs shall coordinate lodging and dining requirements/desires with the
   DTRA Escort Team Chief. (T-2)
   6.8.2. DTRA preference for lodging NST teams is on-base or in a single off-base hotel that
   can accommodate both the entire U.S. escort and Russian inspection teams. Coordination for
   off-base lodging, if arranged by the host-unit TCO, shall be through the base Lodging Office.
   (T-2)
   6.8.3. In the event of a threat situation, lodging will likely be arranged in on-base facilities.
   This may involve creativity due to the short notice nature of NST activities and the relatively
   large size of the escort and inspection teams.
   6.8.4. For on-base lodging, certain precautionary measures may be taken in preparing the
   rooms, but extraordinary measures are not necessarily appropriate. The TCO should
   coordinate with the DTRA Escort Team Chief regarding requirements for lodging (such as
   housekeeping services, telephones, security protection and availability of a 24-hour on-site
   contact).
AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                     29


   6.8.5. Local travel shall be reimbursed IAW wing/unit local travel instructions. (T-2)
   6.8.6. Meals, both on- and off-base, shall be coordinated between the TCO and the DTRA
   Escort Team Chief. (T-2)
   6.8.7. DTRA Escort Team members will pay for their own accommodations and meals,
   while the DTRA Escort Team Class “A” Agent will pay for the Russian inspection team
   members. (T-2)
   6.8.8. Local escort personnel on a meal card must follow guidance in the DFAS-DE Manual
   7073-1. (T-0)
   6.8.9. The TCO should work with the DTRA Escort Team for box lunch arrangements if
   requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief. Payment for box lunches will typically be in
   advance. The TCO will coordinate with the DTRA Escort Team to accommodate this
   payment. (T-2)
6.9. Transportation.
   6.9.1. Host unit TCO will coordinate transportation requirements with the DTRA Escort
   Team Chief. (T-2)
      6.9.1.1. NST activities are conducted on a strict timeline. Transportation must account
      for road closures, base gate security procedures, and traffic situations to ensure adherence
      to this timeline. Transportation will account for weather delays and unanticipated events
      as best they can, and the NST activity will have to accommodate these situations. (T-2)
      6.9.1.2. The TCO should attempt to accommodate the DTRA Escort Team Chief’s
      requests for transportation support for off-base and cultural activities for the Russian
      inspection team as much as practical, within existing policies/guidelines/restrictions. In
      cases where Wing Commander approval is required for the type of activity or location,
      the TCO will facilitate that request. (T-2)
   6.9.2. The number and size of vehicles required shall be determined by the activities being
   performed.
      6.9.2.1. For initial arrival, departure and movement to/from lodging for the first/last
      time, a separate van or truck for luggage/equipment should be provided, if necessary.
      6.9.2.2. For full team movements, such as to cultural events, a VIP coach/bus may be
      appropriate.
   6.9.3. A cadre of qualified drivers will need to be available for the duration of the NST
   activity. (T-2)

                         COMPONENTS OF COMPLIANCE PLAN

A2.1. The wing/unit NST compliance plan should include (but is not limited to) base support
procedures, escort requirements, notifications and reports, procedures to notify local personnel
and affected organizations, security provisions, billeting and transportation requirements,
protocol and public affairs procedures.
A2.2. An important component of the compliance plan is the base activity checklists, which are
needed for recording required actions. The NST compliance plan identifies offices/organizations
responsible for providing logistics support to the visiting escort and inspection teams. The final
plan should include a list showing all tasked organizations including other tenant organizations.
A2.3. Suggested components of a compliance plan:
   A2.3.1. Force Support. This includes lodging, dining, and mortuary services. Lodging and
   dining arrangements will always need to be planned in advance. Consult with the DTRA
   START/Nuclear Division for lodging requirements.
   A2.3.2. Security. This section needs to include high and low threat security procedures for
   escorts, guards, inspector entry into controlled areas, operations security (OPSEC), and
   communications security (COMSEC). (Note: Inspectors must not view normal security
   procedures.)
       A2.3.2.1. If a known threat to the inspection is recognized, high threat options will be
       imposed. These could include measures such as posting guards and implementing entry
       control points requiring Entry Access Lists (EAL) granting the escort and inspection
       teams and local escorts authorized access to inspection sites and support facilities. Low
       threat options may allow implementation of normal distinguished visitor procedures.
       A2.3.2.2. OPSEC procedures such as limiting access and controlling travel routes should
       be included. Weapons handling and storage areas, flight lines and other areas of sensitive
       operations must be protected.
       A2.3.2.3. COMSEC concerns, e.g. how inspectors are allowed to communicate with
       their Embassy/consulate, must be included in your preparations. For example, have local
       escorts work with the DTRA Escort Team to establish appropriate communications links
       for use by inspectors.
   A2.3.3. Medical. Arrangements for emergency/non-elective medical treatment of mission
   team members must be included. DTRA is responsible for the cost of all medical treatments
   and is billed accordingly.
   A2.3.4. Communications. This section must include public address systems for
   ceremonies/briefings, contact between local escorts, methods for inspectors to contact their
   Embassies, contact between inspection team subgroups, or other treaty-specific items.
   A2.3.5. Transportation. All personnel transportation requirements, arrival through departure,
   and equipment/baggage handling to include special handling instructions for inspection
   equipment are included in this section. The TCO will attempt to accommodate the DTRA
   Escort Team Chief’s requests for support of transportation for off-base and cultural activities
AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014                                                                    35


  for the Russian inspection team, within existing guidelines/restrictions. In cases where Wing
  Commander approval is required for the type of activity or location, the TCO will facilitate
  that request.
  A2.3.6. Funding. Considerations include specific billing and payment procedures. Ensure the
  DTRA Escort Team Chief, or his/her designated liaison, knows what is required in advance.
  Coordinate with base activities for items DTRA may request to accomplish their
  responsibilities. Coordinate with the MAJCOM TCO and PEM, preferably in advance of
  incurring expenses, for reimbursement of expenses not paid by DTRA, or that DTRA will not
  pay. If DTRA is not able to fund a TCO request, Operations and Maintenance (O&M)
  dollars may be pursued at the discretion of the local wing/unit commander as long as the
  requirement is authorized IAW financial regulations.
  A2.3.7. Public Affairs. Clearly established ground rules on control of media movement and
  actions are necessary to prevent interference with inspections. The USG and DoD posture
  for NST inspections is “passive.” A “passive posture” means TCOs can respond to inquiries,
  but not actively promote media activities. The NST limits mass media coverage of
  inspection activities to the point of entry. Any public affairs activity, including photography
  (e.g., team photo), at an inspection facility shall be pre-coordinated with the DTRA Escort
  Team Chief.
  A2.3.8. Personnel. Personnel include base escorts, facility managers, baggage details,
  measurement teams, weapon load teams and inspection support staff. Support staffs are
  individuals working real-time contingencies while the treaty office is busy with inspectors;
  support staff should have a representative from each key support and inspection organization.
  A2.3.9. Training. TCOs are responsible for ensuring all base players in an NST activity are
  well trained and able to perform their duties, including suitability of local escorts. Not
  everyone is suited to perform escort duties. While no specific certification is required, TCOs
  should ensure experienced, mature individuals are selected. At the discretion of the unit
  TCO, select senior airmen, NCOs, senior NCOs, officers, or civilians will be used as local
  escorts. Commander support in maintaining the required number of trained escorts is very
  important. In most cases, periodic refresher training is desirable and necessary. At other
  times, just-in-time training of local personnel may be all a base can complete due to limited
  availability of personnel. Bases should have a goal of maintaining a pool of trained
  personnel, as continuity promotes a high level of efficiency and support for complying with
  treaty procedures.
  A2.3.10. Safety/Security. Upon arrival at a host airfield the TCO must present a
  safety/security briefing to the visiting DTRA escort and Russian inspection teams. This
  briefing shall be conducted as part of the Treaty-mandated pre-inspection procedures. The
  briefing should be adapted to the local environment and should provide a perspective of the
  base and facilities to be used by the teams, weather conditions the teams should expect, base
  security policies, escort procedures and local policies, and whom to contact should any
  visiting person need assistance. The briefing must be developed in advance and coordinated
  with AF/A5XP. (Note: The TCO shall apply the same safety/security procedures to the
  Russian inspection teams, DTRA Escort Teams and local escorts.)
  A2.3.11. Prohibited Activity. Identification of any prohibited activity during an NST escort
  mission at an inspectable facility shall be in accordance with USG, DoD, and/or Air Force
36                                                           AFI16-608 26 FEBRUARY 2014


  policy/guidance and shall be the responsibility of the DTRA Escort Team, supported by the
  wing/unit TCO, in direct support of treaty compliance.
  A2.3.12. Protocol. If requested, protocol will assist the TCO in making arrangements for
  distinguished visitors (DVs), arranging off-base meals, hosting reception and departure
  functions, closing ceremonies, and memento exchanges.
  A2.3.13. Cultural Activities. At the DTRA Escort Team Chief’s request, pre-coordinate and
  facilitate leisure activities such as tours, shopping, and recreational opportunities. Work with
  affected support services: Transportation, Base Exchange, Commissary, Recreational
  Services and affected civilian establishments. The participation of wing/unit personnel in
  cultural activities is at the discretion of the DTRA Escort Team Chief, the wing/unit
  commander, and the wing/unit TCO.
