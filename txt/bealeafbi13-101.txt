                   AIRFIELD DRIVING PROGRAM RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Concept. Airfield Management (9 OSS/OSAA) is responsible for the BAFB Airfield
Driving Training Program (ADTP).
     1.1.1. Airfield Management trains and certifies Unit Airfield Driving Program Managers
     (ADPMs). The Unit ADPMs are responsible for training and certifying unit personnel who
     have a requirement to drive on Beale’s airfield. All base assigned personnel who operate a
     vehicle on the airfield must complete all training and testing requirements. Holding a
     particular Air Force Specialty Code or career field training (i.e. operating vehicles or aircraft)
     is not a substitute for completion of airfield driving training and testing requirement.
1.2. Responsibilities.
1.2.1. Wing Commander (9 RW/CC).
        1.2.1.1. Designate personnel and agencies to support BAFB Airfield Driving Program
        (ADP).
        1.2.1.2. Reinstate airfield driving privileges for individuals whose civilian and/or base
        driving privileges have been suspended/revoked when required for the individual to

       2.3.7.2. The maximum towing speed for Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) such as
       compressors, ground power units, oxygen carts, and similar equipment is 15 MPH.
       General purpose vehicles will not be used to tow this equipment unless properly equipped
       with hitches designed for that purpose. Pintle hook safety or cotter pins will be used
       during all towing operations. Safety chains are not required to tow AGE. Towing
       allowances (number/type of AGE) will be IAW AFI 91-203.
       2.3.7.3. Do not use ropes, chains, cables or other flexible means of towing ground
       servicing equipment.
       2.3.7.4. AGE towing vehicles may be placed in neutral and left running while the driver
       completes hook-up operations. This facilitates movement of the AGE towing vehicle by
       hand to align the pintle and hook. Drivers must shut off the vehicle, set the parking
       brake, and place the vehicle in park or reverse if the AGE will not be towed immediately
       following hook-up.

   must be toward the aircraft.
   2.4.3. Do not drive vehicles within 10 feet of a parked aircraft unless the vehicle is required
   for ground servicing. Use of a spotter and pre-positioned chocks are required within 10 feet
   of an aircraft. The delivery of parts, tools or parking near aircraft for convenience does not
   qualify as ground servicing. Refer to AFJMAN 24-306, Chapter 25 and applicable technical
   orders.
   2.4.4. Under no circumstance will a vehicle stop in front of or drive into the path of a
   moving aircraft with exception of “follow-me” vehicles. No vehicles will be driven between
   an aircraft and the “follow-me” vehicle. Mobile vehicles are exempt from this requirement
   when performing “follow-me” functions.
   2.4.5. Vehicles transporting distinguished visitors may approach aircraft with the passenger
   side facing the aircraft, but not closer than 25 feet from the nearest point of the aircraft.
BEALEAFBI13-101 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                    13


2.5. Parking and Chocking Requirements.
   2.5.1. Extreme caution must be used during reverse operations around aircraft. Vehicles
   reversing up to an aircraft must have chocks in position and a spotter or marshalling
   assistance during the entire maneuver.
   2.5.2. Vehicles will park in a manner to eliminate the possibility of striking an aircraft, if
   vehicle inadvertently rolls backward or forward. Vehicles will park as such to restrict
   reverse operations near aircraft. Servicing vehicles (i.e., Fleet Service, fuel truck, etc., due to
   design or particular operation) are required to park perpendicular to the aircraft, therefore are
   exempt.
   2.5.3. The driver will perform the following steps when exiting the vehicle:
      2.5.3.1. Turn off the ignition, set the brakes, place a manual transmission in reverse or an
      automatic transmission in park, and leave the keys in the ignition.
      2.5.3.2. Use chocks to secure all vehicles and wheeled equipment without an integral
      braking system when left unattended on aircraft-parking ramps.
   2.5.4. Aircraft must be chocked and engines shut down on the appropriate side before stair
   trucks/boarding ramps are positioned.
   2.5.5. Vehicles parked within 10 feet of any aircraft will have one rear wheel chocked fore
   and aft with parking brake applied. Chocks will be used to secure all vehicles and wheeled
   equipment without an integral braking system.
   2.5.6. Never drive a vehicle under any aircraft part, especially the wings.
   2.5.7. Never park a vehicle in front of hangar doors unless vehicle is involved in servicing of
   aircraft. Keep this area clear for aircraft towing operations and maintain 25 foot minimum
   wing-tip clearances.

   the aircraft is being serviced, loaded, or unloaded.
2.6. Lateral Distance Requirements for Fixed and Mobile Obstacles.
   2.6.1. All vehicles operating in/or around the airfield are considered mobile obstacles.
   Maintenance vehicles and emergency vehicles operating on ramps/aprons and in the CMA
   have special separation standards and are not addressed in this section. Other vehicles
   operating on an airfield must comply with the following:
   2.6.2. The lateral clearance distance from taxiway centerline to parked or moving vehicles is
   200 feet. When operating off the edges of a taxiway no vehicle will be parked and left
   unattended within 200 feet of the taxiway centerline. No fixed obstacle will be located closer
   than 200 feet from the centerline of any taxiway without an approved waiver.
   2.6.3. The lateral clearance distance from the edge of all ramps and aprons to a mobile
   obstacle is 50 feet. When operating off the edges of a ramp or apron do not park or operate a
   vehicle within 50 feet of a moving aircraft. To ensure separation from any aircraft in the Air
   Force inventory, vehicles should park a minimum of 125 feet from edge of pavement.
   2.6.4. The lateral clearance distance from the runway centerline is 1000 feet.              When
   operating within this area, do not park and leave a vehicle unattended.

   2.6.5. Vehicles utilizing the driving lanes on taxilane H, B and nose dock area need to give
   way to taxiing aircraft and ensure 25 foot wingtip clearance is established.
2.7. FOD Control/Prevention.
   2.7.1. Vehicles must come to a complete stop before entering the airfield. The vehicle
   operator will put the vehicle in park, exit the vehicle and perform a thorough roll-over FOD
   check before proceeding onto the airfield. At a minimum, a FOD check will consist of the
   following:
       2.7.1.1. Inspection of the vehicle tires (pull forward to check tire in contact with
       pavement). Remove foreign materials (e.g., rocks, gravel, etc.). If driving on
       unimproved surfaces is required, conduct a FOD check upon exit of these areas or
       returning to paved surfaces.
       2.7.1.2. A visual check to ensure all external vehicle components are secured. Secure
       any/all items loaded on payload vehicles, including all tie down device loose ends such as
       chains, ropes, packaging or other items that may become dislodged during movement
       while on the airfield.
       2.7.1.3. A thorough walk around of the vehicle to check for damaged, loose or worn
       parts.
   2.7.2. Vehicles, with exception of emergency vehicles responding to emergencies, will not
   enter the ramp from an unpaved area.
   2.7.3. Vehicle operators who must drive off the paved surface must complete a vehicle roll-
   over FOD check before returning to the paved surface. The vehicle returning to the paved
   surface must pull onto and stop at the extreme edge of the paved surface until all four wheels
   are on the pavement. Perform a FOD check removing all rocks, dirt, etc., to include but not
   limited to tires, undercarriage and/or wheel wells.
   2.7.4. Exit the airfield via the shortest authorized route. If FOD was significant,
   immediately report the area and route taken to exit the airfield to AMOPS via radio or DSN:
   368-2002. AMOPS will inspect the area for FOD and contact a sweeper if necessary.
2.8. Restricted Visibility or Night Operations.
   2.8.1. If visibility is less than 100 feet, POVs and airfield vehicles (except emergency
   vehicles) will not be operated on the airfield.
   2.8.2. Vehicle operators will yield right of way to all taxiing or towed aircraft.
   2.8.3. During night operations, vehicles facing a taxiing aircraft must turn off vehicle
   headlights and turn on hazard lights until the aircraft passes.
   2.8.4. Vehicles with daytime running lights will park in a safe location with ignition off,
   parking brake set and emergency flashers on until the aircraft passes.
   2.8.5. Flashing hazard lights or parking lights will be used during the hours of darkness or
   inclement weather when vehicles are temporarily parked on any part of the ramp. This does
   not apply if vehicles are parked in designated areas.

   2.24.10. Taxiway F: In the vicinity of taxiways C and D, the slope of the taxiway limits
   visibility in both directions.
   2.24.11. Frequent U-2 and high speed Mobile traffic “over the hill” at taxiway C, D and K
   intersections.
2.25. Precision Obstacle Free Zone (POFZ). BAFB runway has two precision obstacle free
zones requiring protection from possible signal interference caused by aircraft and vehicles
operating between the localizer/glide slope antennas and an arriving aircraft conducting an
Instrument Landing System (ILS) approach. The dimensions are 800 feet (400 feet on each side
of the runway centerline) and extend 200 feet from the end of the runway. These protected areas
are the Localizer and Glide Slope Critical Areas located at the departure and approach ends of
Runways 15 and 33, respectively. Aircraft and vehicles are prohibited from operating in these
areas when the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet or the visibility is less than two miles and an
aircraft is on an ILS approach. ILS instrument hold signs and taxiway instrument hold lines
protect these areas. Approval must be obtained from the ATCT prior to entering these areas.
2.26. Intrusion/Incursion Prevention.
   2.26.1. The ATCT has ultimate authority over all traffic entering the CMA and will issue, by
   radio and/or light signals, specific instructions which approve, disapprove and/or recall the
   movement of aircraft, vehicles, equipment or personnel within the movement area. Each
   entry requires an approval and every exit requires a reporting off.
   2.26.2. Vehicles will use the access road and adjacent taxiways whenever possible instead of
   crossing the runway. Only in extreme circumstances will a vehicle operator cross an active
   runway and then only after approval of ATCT.
2.27. Taxiways.
   2.27.1. Used by aircraft to get to and from the parking ramp/apron and the runway.
   Attachments 2 and 3 depict various taxiway signs and markings seen on an airport
   environment
   2.27.2. Ground vehicle operators will not drive on the taxiway centerline unless specifically
   checking the pavement condition, checking for FOD, sweeping the taxiway, or towing
   aircraft. Normally, the only vehicles that drive on the centerline are AMOPS vehicles
   (Airfield 1, Airfield 2 or Airfield 3), Follow-Me vehicles, the Airfield Sweeper (Sweeper 1),
   FOD NCO (FOD 1, FOD 2), U-2 Mobile (Aircraft call sign follow by mobile, i.e. Pinon 92

   MOBILE or 92 MOBILE), and RQ-4 HAWKEYE. RQ-4 HAWKEYE operates in a manner
   similar to U-2 mobiles.
   2.27.3. Ground vehicle operators will drive on the far-right side of a taxiway. Extra care
   will be taken not to damage the raised taxiway lights.
2.28. Passengers and Cargo in Vehicles.
   2.28.1. Personnel will not ride on trailers or any part of a vehicle not intended for carrying
   passengers. Exceptions to this may be authorized in base exercise plans.
   2.28.2. Passengers will remain seated and keep arms and legs within the vehicle while the
   vehicle is in motion.
   2.28.3. All passengers will wear seat belts at all times while the vehicle is in motion(TO
   36A-1-6 ).
   2.28.4. Passengers will not ride in the doorways or sit on the engine cover of metro vans
   (also called step vans). Rear door nets will be used while passengers are transported if doors
   are open.
   2.28.5. Passenger van side doors will be closed while the vehicle is in motion.
   2.28.6. Passengers are prohibited from riding on towed equipment.
   2.28.7. Passengers will not mount or dismount vehicles while the vehicle is in motion.
   2.28.8. Cargo will be secured with ropes, chains, or chocks to prevent injury or damage.
   Cargo extended beyond the vehicle’s body will have a red flag attached during daylight hours
   or a red warning reflector/light during hours of darkness.
2.29. Disabled Vehicles.
   2.29.1. When a vehicle is disabled or immobilized on a taxiway, every means will be used to
   alert taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. As a minimum, the ground vehicle operator will:
   2.29.2. Leave the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers on during hours of darkness.
   2.29.3. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission: “All
   parties BREAK, BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield Management,
   Tower and Maintenance Operations Center”. State the nature of the problem and report
   your position on the airfield.
   2.29.4. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (e.g. security forces, civil engineer,
   transportation, etc.) must make every effort to assist getting the disabled vehicle off the
   airfield, especially if the vehicle is located on parking aprons, taxiways, or the runway.
   2.29.5. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the vehicle and continue
   attempts to alert any taxiing aircraft or other vehicles in the vicinity.
   2.29.6. In the event of a disabled vehicle on the CMA, the vehicle operator will immediately
   notify the ATCT and AMOPS by any means possible to coordinate expeditious removal of
   the disable vehicle from the CMA.
       2.29.6.1. The vehicle operator will ensure the disabled vehicle is not left unattended on
       the CMA.
BEALEAFBI13-101 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  19


      2.29.6.2. The disabled vehicle will be removed using the quickest and safest way
      possible.
2.30. Pedestrian Movement.
   2.30.1. Pedestrians are authorized on the airfield for official business in support of the flying
   mission.
   2.30.2. Walk facing oncoming traffic.
   2.30.3. Do not sit or recline while on the ramp in such a manner that interferes with normal
   ground vehicle and aircraft operations.
   2.30.4. Do not enter the CMA without two-way radio contact and approval from the ATCT.
2.31. Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations.
   2.31.1. The RQ-4 mission initiates with maintenance towing the aircraft to a launch spot
   (mission start point). Limitations in the aircraft design preclude starting and taxiing from any
   location other than the surveyed launch spots. Engine start commences usually one hour
   before takeoff. The pilot, RQ-4 Mobile (call sign ―Hawkeye), and the crew performing the
   engine start will monitor ground frequency during engine start operations.
   2.31.2. There are two designated RQ-4 start points; Global Hawk South (GH-S) on the
   Hawk Ramp and Global Hawk Hammerhead (GH-HH) on the north hammerhead adjacent
   Taxiway Bravo.
   2.31.3. Hawkeye Operations.
      2.31.3.1. Departures: When Runway 15 is active, Hawkeye shall use Taxiway B for
      staging run-ins to the runway. When Runway 33 is active, Hawkeye shall use Taxiway E
      for staging run-ins to the runway.
      2.31.3.2. Arrivals: Hawkeye will be staged on Taxiway Charlie for Runway 15 or
      Taxiway Delta for Runway 33 a minimum 15 minutes prior to arrival and will monitor
      the approach and landing from there (i.e., RQ-4 ground track, bird activity, traffic, etc).
      Hawkeye is automatically cleared onto the runway behind the RQ-4 when the aircraft
      crosses in front of Taxiway Charlie for Runway 15 or Taxiway Delta for Runway 33.

                                          Chapter 3

              OPERATING IN THE CONTROLLED MOVEMENT AREA

3.1. CMA Access.
   3.1.1. Any vehicle requiring access to the CMA will be equipped with operational radio
   equipment capable of direct two-way contact with the ATCT. Drivers must receive radio
   approval from the ATCT prior to proceeding into the CMA. Drivers must monitor the ATCT
   frequency at all times while operating in the CMA. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a
   daily basis must have a permanent radio mounted in the vehicle to communicate with the
   ATCT. A hand-held radio will only be used as a backup or when communication is required
   outside the vehicle. Note: Conduct an operational test of the radio before entering the
   airfield.
   3.1.2. Any vehicle proceeding onto the CMA will be equipped with rotating beacon or
   emergency flashers that are visible for one mile. The use of those lights helps to highlight
   the vehicle’s location to the ATCT.
   3.1.3. In the event of radio failure or loss of communication on the runway, ATCT will flash
   the runway edge lights. Once alerted, the vehicle operator will immediately exit the runway.
   Re-attempt contact with ATCT or AMOPS immediately and advise off the runway and
   include any pertinent information that might affect safe runway operations. If unable to
   communicate with ATCT or AMOPS via radio, use other means of communication such as a
   cellular phone (when available). If this is not practical, then the driver, after vacating the
   runway, should turn the vehicle toward the ATCT and start flashing the vehicle headlights
   and wait for the controller to signal with the light gun. Report loss of communication
   incident to AMOPS immediately.
   3.1.4. If ATCT controller is unable to contact vehicles, they will contact AMOPS for
   immediate assistance.
   3.1.5. When escorting other vehicles, use the word “plus” followed by the number of
   vehicles being escorted. Note: Personnel requiring access in the CMA who do not have
   two-way radio contact with the ATCT must be escorted. The escort must be authorized to
   drive on the airfield, have “CMA ACCESS” annotated on the AF IMT 483, be familiar with
   CMA procedures, and have direct two-way radio contact with AND approval from the ATCT
   prior to entering the CMA.
3.2. Procedures for Proper Radio Terminology/Phraseology and Discipline.
   3.2.1. The phrase “Clear” or “Clearance” will not be used by personnel operating vehicles
   on the airfield. Instead, state “off the runway” or “requesting access/entry onto the runway”
   when contacting the ATCT for permission on/off the runway. Exception: Vehicle operators
   may reply “Loud and Clear” in response to an ATCT request for radio transmission quality
   or clarity.
   3.2.2. Vehicles operating on the airfield are assigned call signs. Vehicle call signs must be
   approved by AM to ensure call signs are not duplicated (Attachment 14).
BEALEAFBI13-101 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                               21


   3.2.3. Correct use of radio phraseology is extremely important. Vehicle operators will be in
   radio contact with the ATCT while operating in the CMA. Everyone must communicate in
   the same manner to avoid confusion. Correct and incorrect radio usage is described below:
      3.2.3.1. Incorrect language includes “10” codes, phrases like “10-4” and “Good Buddy”
      are not used on airports; plain language is required. Instead of “10-4” say, “I copy” or “I
      understand.” Using unapproved terminology is confusing and unprofessional. Avoid
      using personal names such as “Kathy, or Smith”; there are too many people with the
      same or similar names. Use the phonetic alphabet in Attachment 13.
      3.2.3.2. Correct language is short, direct, precise and descriptive, leaving no room for
      confusion or error. Always read back ATC instructions verbatim.

Figure 3.1. Example Runway Access Request




Figure 3.2. Example Controlled Movement Area Exit Request




      3.2.3.3. ATCT may instruct you to “Hold Short” of the runway. This guidance means to
      stop upon reaching the VFR hold line and do not proceed beyond the VFR hold line or
      any other location ATCT tells you to “hold short” of. ATCT will advise when it is safe
      to proceed. If there is a question about what to do, repeat your request or ask the ATCT
      to “Say again”.
 22                                                BEALEAFBI13-101 5 DECEMBER 2013


      3.2.3.4. Vehicle operators/pedestrians, upon leaving the CMA, will notify the ATCT of
      the location at which they exited (e.g. “Ground, Airfield 3 is off the runway at taxiway
      echo.”).
      3.2.3.5. When the ATCT requests vehicles/pedestrians to exit the runway/movement
      area, all vehicles will depart immediately to an area behind the runway hold lines.
      3.2.3.6. Two-way radio communication is the primary way to communicate with the
      ATCT and is critical to flight safety. Ensure all ATCT instructions are heard and
      understood. If there is any doubt, ask for clarification. The ATCT will not issue or use
      unconditional instructions (i.e. blanket approval) when authorizing vehicles to enter the
      runway.
3.3. Control Tower Light Gun Signal.
   3.3.1. Drivers must abide by the ATCT’s light gun signals. Decals depicting light-gun
   signals and their meanings are required in all vehicles operating on the CMA. Decals
   (AFVA 11-240, Airports Signs and Markings, or FAA Form 5280-7, Airfield Visual Aid
   Safety Placard,) are available from AMOPS, Building 1060. These decals also may be
   downloaded from http://www.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFVA13-221.pdf.
   3.3.2. Light Gun Signals are as follows:

Figure 3.3. ATCT Light Gun Signals.




   3.3.3. The decal may be permanently affixed in plain view of the driver or clipped to the
   inside of the sun visor on the driver’s side of the vehicle, so it may be flipped down and
   ready for reference.
   3.3.4. All airfield vehicle operators will know and comply with all airfield signs, markings
   and ATCT signals.
3.4. Procedures for Determining an Individual’s Color Vision.
   3.4.1. Personnel training for driving on the CMA must have a color vision test completed by
   the 9 MDG Optometry Flight.
   3.4.2. Prospective airfield drivers must be able to distinguish between colors: red, green,
   white, yellow and blue.
BEALEAFBI13-101 5 DECEMBER 2013                                                                  23


   3.4.3. Personnel who fail the color vision test may be issued an airfield certificate restricting
   vehicle operation to “Ramp only” and will not be authorized to operate a vehicle on the
   CMA.
   3.4.4. EXCEPTION TO TESTING. Personnel who do not have a requirement to drive on
   the CMA and will have the restriction “Ramp only” do not need a color vision test. Career
   fields requiring a color vision test before entry (i.e. fire fighters, flying positions,
   maintenance, etc.) do not need to retest. Refer to the Officer and Enlisted Classification
   Directory for AFSCs that have a mandatory requirement for normal color vision in their
   AFSC. Previous test results must indicate the member is able to distinguish red, green,
   white, yellow and blue. The individual must provide official documentation of results from
   the appropriate Medical Group to the program manager for verification
   3.4.5. For civilian employees, a color vision test will be listed as a requirement for
   employment. The color vision exam will be accomplished in the pre-employment exam. If
   the member fails the color vision test, he/she will be referred to optometry to determine the
   level of deficiency.
3.5. Airfield Signs, Markings, and Lighting. Signs, markings, and lighting are standard and
meet all criteria required by the Air Force and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
Mandatory signs/markings/lighting are used to denote the entrance to a runway or critical area,
and must not be passed unless permission is granted by the ATCT. Information/location signs
are used to provide airfield information and identify the taxiway on which the aircraft or vehicle
is located. Standard runway lights are white, and taxiway lights are blue. Examples of Airfield
Signs, Markings and Lighting are as follows:

                                          Chapter 4

           REPORTING, ENFORCING, AND VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE

4.1. Runway Incursions/Controlled Movement Area Violations (CMAV)
   4.1.1. A CMAV event is an airfield violation caused by aircraft, vehicles or pedestrians
   entering the CMA without specific ATCT approval. This definition also includes runway
   incursions. A runway incursion is a CMAV event that involves the incorrect presence of an
   aircraft, vehicle or person on the runway. CMAVs are further classified into three
   operational categories, which are operational error, pilot deviation, and vehicle/pedestrian.
   CMAVs are usually caused by failing to follow proper radio communications procedures,
   typically due to complacency, distraction or inattention to detail.
   4.1.2. The ATCT will immediately notify AMOPS of all CMAVs. AMOPS will respond
   and escort the individual(s) to AMOPS to obtain a written statement. The individual’s AF
   IMT 483 must be surrendered to AMOPS and airfield driving privileges will be revoked until
   an investigation and retraining/certification are complete. If appropriate, the ATCT and/or
   AMOPS will complete an AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report or AF Form 651, Hazardous
   Air Traffic Report, and provide a copy to AMOPS. AM will notify MAJCOM OPR for AO
   within 24 hours of a CMAV/HATR incident.
   4.1.3. AMOPS will investigate the violation and report findings to the AFM. The AFM will
   then determine a course of action. If a driver’s privileges are suspended, the individual will
   retrain on the standards contained in this instruction. A second runway incursion could result
   in permanent revocation of airfield driving privileges. The Wing ADPM and Wing Safety
   must inspect the unit airfield driving program of personnel that commit a runway incursion as
   part of the investigation. Emphasis will be placed on how the unit trained the individual and
   their compliance with this instruction. The results will be reported to the unit commander.
4.2. Airfield Violations. Personnel witnessing violations should immediately notify AMOPS at
DSN: 368-2002, Comm: 530-634-2002, and give a brief description and location of the
violation. AMOPS will respond and/or may request security forces assistance through the Base
Defense Operations Center (BDOC) at DSN: 368-2131 or Comm: 530-634-2131 to escort the
individual(s) to AMOPS. Depending on the severity of the violation, AMOPS personnel may
revoke the individual’s AF IMT 483 and have the violator provide a description of the incident.
All paperwork concerning the violation will be submitted to the AFM for further investigation.
4.3. AF IMT 483 Suspensions/Revocations/Reinstatements.
   4.3.1. Gross or repeated violations of safety or airfield driving rules, or an overall
   demonstrated lack of ability on the part of the ground vehicle operator will result in a
   suspension or revocation of airfield driving privileges. Common reasons for suspension
   include speeding, reckless driving, misuse/abuse of the vehicle, physical/mental impairment,
   display of poor judgment or behavior, and unsafe acts or behavior. Verbal warnings may be
   given by anyone witnessing a violation. NOTE: All revoked certificates require a written
   letter from the unit commander requesting reinstatement.
26                                                  BEALEAFBI13-101 5 DECEMBER 2013


     4.3.1.1. Unit commanders, ADPMs, Security Forces, and AMOPS personnel are
     authorized to suspend airfield driving privileges of those violating the provisions of this
     instruction or performing unsafe acts on the airfield.
  4.3.2. Suspension. Any supervisor in the driver’s chain of command may also suspend a
  driver’s certificate. Written notification stating the reason for the suspension will be sent to
  the offender’s unit commander and unit ADPM with a courtesy copy sent to the wing safety

                                 RADIO PHRASEOLOGY

A13.1. General. When driving on the controlled movement area (CMA), clear and proper
communication is vital. Both you and the ATCT controller must ensure communications are
understood.
   A13.1.1. Never assume
   A13.1.2. Always ask for assistance if you have any doubt about whether to proceed.
   A13.1.3. If the instructions you receive from the ATCT controller are unclear, ask they be
   repeated by stating “Say again.”
   A13.1.4. If there is anything about the instructions you do not understand, ask for further
   explanation—do not assume.
   A13.1.5. Always repeat or “read-back” your instructions to the ATCT controller.
A13.2. Radio Communication Procedures.
   A13.2.1. Use a two-way radio capable of communicating with the ATCT. Normally, airfield
   vehicles are tuned in to the Ramp Net. Each vehicle must have a unique call sign identifying
   the vehicle (i.e., no two vehicles will have the same call sign).
   A13.2.2. Think about what you are going to say before calling the ATCT.
   A13.2.3. Know and use proper phraseology. (Refer to the Aviation Phraseology and
   Aviation Alphabet at the end of this section.) Never use Citizen’s Band lingo or law
   enforcement “ten” codes.
   A13.2.4. Use the proper sequence in calling the ATCT. Before you start talking, ensure no
   one else is already talking. Key your microphone and do the following:
      A13.2.4.1. State who you are calling and identify yourself by using your vehicle call
      sign. Example: “Beale Ground, Airfield One.”
      A13.2.4.2. Wait for the ATCT controller to respond. Be patient, as it sometimes takes a
      while if the controller is busy. When the controller responds, “Airfield One, Ground”,
      state where you are and where you want to go. Example: “Airfield One on Taxiway
      Alpha. Request access onto the runway.” NOTE: The order in which you state where
      you are and where you want to go is unimportant. You can easily state where you want
      to go and where you are located instead. For example, “Airfield One requests access
      onto the runway from taxiway Alpha.” The important thing to remember is both pieces
      of information are required—where you are and where you are going.
      A13.2.4.3. Wait for the controller’s response. The controller will either approve or deny
      your request, or give you modified instructions. Example: “Airfield One, proceed onto
      the runway. Report when off.”
      A13.2.4.4. Always read back instructions from the ATCT. Example: “Airfield One
      proceeding onto the runway. Will report when off.”

A13.3. Aviation Phraseology.
   A13.3.1. Acknowledge—Let me know you have received and understand this message.
   A13.3.2. Advise intentions—Tell me what you plan to do.
   A13.3.3. Affirmative—Yes.
   A13.3.4. Confirm—My version is…is that correct?
   A13.3.5. Correction—An error has been made in the transmission, and the correct version
   follows.
   A13.3.6. Go ahead—Say your request (Caution: “go ahead” never means “proceed”).
   A13.3.7. Hold—Stop where you are.
   A13.3.8. Hold short of—Proceed to, but hold short of a specific point.
   A13.3.9. Negative—No, or permission is not granted, or that is not correct.
   A13.3.10. Proceed—You are authorized to begin or continue moving.
   A13.3.11. Read back—Repeat my message back to me.
   A13.3.12. Roger—I received all of your last transmission. (It should not be used to answer a
   yes or no question.)
   A13.3.13. Say again—Repeat what you just said.
   A13.3.14. Standby—Wait…I will get back to you. (Standby is not an approval or denial.
   The caller should reestablish contact if the delay is lengthy.)
   A13.3.15. Unable—Indicates inability to comply with a specific instruction, request, or
   clearance
   A13.3.16. Verify—Request confirmation of information.
   A13.3.17. Wilco—I have received your message, understand it, and will comply.
A13.4. The Phonetic Alphabet. The following tables show the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) phonetic alphabet that is used in radio communications. Use the words in
place of letters to reduce confusion. For example, Taxiway T would be referred to as Taxiway
Tango.
