1. Headquarters Pacific Air Forces Complex, B1102.
   1.1. History. Designed in 1938 as a barracks to house 3,200 enlisted men, Building 1102
   was completed on 30 September 1940. The building sustained major bomb damage during
 2                                                                 PACAFI32-1001 5 JUNE 2012


     the 7 December 1941 surprise Japanese air attack on Pearl Harbor and surrounding military
     installations. The building was put on the register of National Historic Landmarks due to the
     historic significance of the damage inflicted and loss of life during this important event in our
     nation’s history. In 1957 five wings of Building 1102 were converted to administrative space.
     On 1 July of that year HQ Far East Air Forces, renamed PACAF, completed a move from
     Japan to its new location in Building 1102. Since that time the building has been entirely
     converted to administrative space.
     1.2. Background. HQ PACAF shares Building 1102 with elements of the 15th Wing and
     support organizations and is the nerve center of United States Air Force command activities
     in the Pacific and Far East. Proper facility sustainment, restoration, and modernization are
     necessary to maintain continuity of day-to-day operations that prepare the staff for high
     tempo contingency operations. Failure of real property serving critical command and control
     systems could have an adverse impact on the mission of PACAF. This instruction lays out
     the framework for sustainment, restoration, and modernization of Building 1102.
     1.3. B1102 Repair Project.
        1.3.1. Due to the age of the building and infrastructure, the size (over 500,000 square
        feet), and the statutory spend limits on facilities, the HQ PACAF Complex has been a
        challenge to keep functional. As an historic landmark, demolishing B1102 was out of the
        question. In August 2009, a $123M multi-phased/multi-year B1102 Repair Project was
        approved.
        1.3.2. The project has four core objectives: meet regulatory requirements (life safety
        codes, American Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance, energy efficiency, and historical
        preservation); meet mission requirements; improve functional efficiency (heating,
        ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), utilities, and communications infrastructure, as
        well as space utilization; right size, defragment, improve traffic and work flow); and
        lastly, merge 13th Air Force personnel and missions currently housed in Kenney HQ
        trailers into B1102.
        1.3.3. The B1102 Repair Project established an authorization level limiting new
        work/projects to this building. For the duration of the repair project, all such work must
        be coordinated through both the HQ PACAF Building Management Office (HQ
        PACAF/CCQM) as well as the Project Management Office (PMO). Once the B1102
        Repair Project is completed, all new work/projects will go through corporate review by a
        Building 1102 Facility Board.
     1.4. Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (JBPHH). With the finalization of JBPHH, all
     facilities on Hickam became Navy real property. In October 2010, 15 CES became 647 CES,
     and aligned with Naval Facility (NAVFAC) procedures. The Air Force Form 332, Base Civil
     Engineer Work Request, was replaced with the NAVFAC Technical Form 1 (TF-1),
     Customer Request Form, for all Civil Engineer (CE) work requests. Facility management
     procedures are required to follow JBPHHINST 11010.1 guidance.
2. Building 1102 Building Management.
     2.1. Requirement. The Building 1102 Building Management Office (HQ PACAF/CCQM)
     is required to oversee all maintenance, support, and preservation of the PACAF HQ building.
PACAFI32-1001 5 JUNE 2012                                                                  3


  2.2. Building 1102 Building Manager Responsibilities. The Building 1102 Building
  Manager, HQ PACAF/CCQM, is the main point-of-contact for all work in Building 1102.
  The Building Manager’s responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
     2.2.1. Maintaining records of all day-to-day work in the building.
     2.2.2. Coordinating all new work, and work space issues; reconfigurations, re-locations,
     etc. with B1102 Repair PMO.
     2.2.3. Acting as liaison between building occupants, the Base Contracting Office and the
     647 CES for all work in Building 1102 as well as the surrounding grounds and parking.
     2.2.4. Ensuring Building Area Representatives (BAR) from tenant organization carry out
     their responsibilities and assist them as necessary.
  2.3. Building Area Representatives (BAR).
     2.3.1. Each tenant organization in Building 1102 will appoint a primary and alternate
     Building Area Representatives for their area. Tennant organizations will provide the
     name, grade, office symbol, duty and home phone numbers of its primary and alternate
     BAR to HQ PACAF/CCQM.
     2.3.2. Each organization will update their BAR list with HQ PACAF/CCQM when a
     representative changes.
     2.3.3. (Added) As a minimum, BARs for Building 1102 will carry out their
     responsibilities as Building Managers for their respective areas per JBPHHINST 11010.1.
