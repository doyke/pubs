   Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons.
   4.9. Nuclear weapons will be transported as determined by the Combatant Commander or
   the Military Department, in accordance with DoDD 4540.5, Logistic Transportation of
   Nuclear Weapons. Additionally, the following safety guidance applies:
      4.9.1. Movement(s) will be kept to a minimum consistent with operational requirements.
      4.9.2. Custody and accountability transfers during logistic movements shall be by courier
      receipt system to ensure positive control.
   4.10. Permissive Action Link (PAL) operations shall be in accordance with plans and
   procedures prescribed by the applicable Combatant Command and Technical Publication.
   4.11. Verification that a nuclear warhead is not present in a test assembly must be made
   utilizing nonnuclear assurance procedures at the last practical opportunity agreed on by the
   Department of Defense and/or Department of Energy before the conduct of an operational
   test.
   4.12. Deviations from safety rules are permitted in an emergency, except as follows:
      4.12.1. U.S. custody must be maintained until receipt of a valid nuclear control order that
      permits transferring U.S. nuclear weapons to non-U.S. delivery forces.
      4.12.2. Nuclear weapons shall not be expended unless a valid, properly authenticated
      nuclear control order conveying release or expenditure authority is received.
5. Specific Guidance.
   5.1. These rules, weapon system design and security features, operational and administrative
   controls, and technical procedures ensure the nuclear weapons meet the Nuclear Weapon
   System Safety Standards in AFI 91-101, Air Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program, and
