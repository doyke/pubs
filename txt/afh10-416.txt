                            GENERAL INFORMATION AND PURPOSE

1.1. General Information on Mobilization Planning. Mobilization encompasses all activities neces-
sary for the orderly transition of active and ANGUS/USAFR forces from a peacetime to wartime posture.
The War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 6 (WMP-VI), covers transitioning the industrial base from a nor-
mal state of peacetime preparedness to wartime production postures (also see Joint Pub 1-02).

1.2. Purpose of Mobilization Planning. The means by which organizations charged with mobilization
responsibilities define policies and document procedures to accomplish tasks.

1.3. Testing Mobilization Procedures. HQ USAF/DPX will evaluate personnel mobilization systems
and procedures at least semiannually.
    1.3.1. A Mobilization Systems Test (MST) that evaluates mobilization policy, procedures, and sys-
    tems will be conducted at least twice a year. This may be part of a JCS Mobilization Exercise, an Air
    Force-directed Command Post Exercise (CPX), or Field Training Exercise (FTX). At least one test/
    exercise per year will be down to unit/individual level.
    1.3.2. These exercises/tests will provide "no fault" opportunities to train and evaluate processes, pro-
    cedures, customer service, and supporting information/reporting systems (both C2 and administra-
    tion) that support the activation.
    1.3.3. HQ USAF/DPXC will coordinate objectives and participants that may include selected major
    commands (MAJCOM), Air National Guard Readiness Center (ANGRC), HQ AFRES, and HQ
    ARPC with systems support provided by AFMPC.
    1.3.4. ANGRC and HQ AFRES will coordinate unit play while HQ ARPC will coordinate individual
    play (both Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) and Pretrained Individual Manpower (PIM).
    1.3.5. The tests will use Joint Exercise Manual (JEM) procedures for standardization and training.
    This includes use of a control staff, master scenario events lists (MSEL) and after action reporting
    using the Joint Exercise Management Package (JEMP) software.
    1.3.6. Objectives will be outlined annually with detailed objectives included in JCS or Air Force
    Explans along with system test files and procedures.
    1.3.7. Each organization participating is encouraged to use Quality Management principles to evalu-
    ate procedures, processes, and systems and share these with the personnel readiness community.

                          MOBILIZATION PLAN RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Mobilization Plans Detail Responsibilities and Procedures. Programming data contained in
WMP-3 and US Air Force program series documents will be used as a mobilization planning base. Prep-
ositioned orders are not required for volunteerism, Presidential Selected Reserve Callup (PSRC), or par-
tial mobilization. For full mobilization, orders publication guidance will be in the execution order.

2.2. Air Force Component Commanders. Identify mobilization assumptions in operation and contin-
gency plans written to support unified and specified command plans.

2.3. Major Commands. Develop appropriate mobilization plans to ensure forces are mobilized to meet
the force availability that has been identified in WMP-3, Parts 1 and 2.

2.4. Air Force Installations. Develop mobilization plans using JOPES format contained in AFMAN
10-401. Ensure the installation is available for mobilizing forces. The plan should include:
   2.4.1. Applicable support agreement (SA) and memorandum of understanding (MOU) information
   that identifies type of support required, organizations providing support, and when the support is to be
   available.
   2.4.2. A detailed account of the active force manpower, material, and time needed to provide support
   for those actions required by the SA or MOUs.
   2.4.3. Voice and data circuits available for carrying out mobilization.

2.5. The ANGUS/USAFR Wing or Group Com-mander. Publishes a mobilization plan for all units
serviced by the MPF. When necessary, units and geographically separated units (GSU) will prepare
annexes to the mobilization plan.

2.6. Unit Mobilization Plans. Wings/Groups will develop mobilization plans according to this docu-
ment. These plans will interface with installation mobility plans to ensure combat and support forces
meet the stated mobility response times.

                                             ACTIVATION

3.1. General Descriptions, Types of Activation, and Planning. Generally, the nature and imminence
of the emergency governs the level of response. There are seven major defined types of activation:
    3.1.1. Retired Members ( 10 USC 688). Assigned to such duties as the Secretary of the Air Force
    (SAF) considers necessary in the interests of national defense. Under regulations prescribed by the
    Secretary of Defense, a retired member of the Regular Air Force (REGAF) or a member of the Retired
    Reserve who has completed at least 20 years active service ("active service" means service on active
    duty - 10 USC 101) may be ordered to active duty (AD) by the SAF at any time for any duration. The
    number that can be activated is limited only by available funds to pay the individuals and the end
    strength at the end of the fiscal year.
    3.1.2. Volunteerism (10 USC 672(d)). To meet immediate requirements for augmentation of the
    Active Air Force during emergency (domestic or international) or contingency operations. This
    authority, when authorized by the SAF, is utilized by the MAJCOMs/FOAs to place ANGUS/USAFR
    Selected Reserve volunteers on AD. This authority is usually used as a bridge to expand Active Force
    capabilities while awaiting legal authority for PSRC or mobilization. The number of personnel
    involved is determined by the AD MAJCOMs/FOAs.
    3.1.3. Selective Mobilization (10 USC 331, 332, 333, 3500, and 8500). F o r a d o m e s t i c e m e r -
    gency. The President (or the Congress upon special action) may order expansion of the Active Armed
    Forces by mobilization of Reserve Component (RC) units and/or individual reservists to deal with a
    situation where Armed Forces may be required to protect life, federal property and functions, or to
    prevent disruption of federal activities. A selected mobilization normally would not be associated
    with a requirement for contingency plans involving external threats to national security. The number
    of personnel involved is determined by the units selected for mobilization.
    3.1.4. Presidential Selected Reserve Callup (10 USC 673b). The President may augment the
    Active Armed Forces by a callup of Selected Reserve units and individuals for up to 270 days to meet
    the requirements of an operational mission. The President must notify the Congress and state reasons
    for action. There is a limitation of not more than 200,000 total Selected Reserve members from all
    RCs.
    3.1.5. Partial Mobilization (10 USC 673). Required to meet requirements of war or other national
    emergency involving an external threat to national security. Upon declaration of a national emer-
    gency by the President or when otherwise authorized by law, an authority designated by the Secretary
    concerned may order an augmentation of the Active Armed Forces (short of full mobilization) and
    mobilization of the Ready Reserve (units and individuals) for up to 24 months. There is a limitation
    of 1,000,000 total Ready Reserve members from all RCs.
    3.1.6. Full Mobilization (10 USC 672(a)). Requires passage by the Congress of a Public Law or
    joint resolution declaring war or a national emergency. Provides authority to mobilize all RC units
    and individual reservists in the existing force structure, and the material resources needed to support
    the expanded structure. All forces up to the strength of the approved force structure may be mobi-
    lized. This mobilization authority is for the duration of the war or emergency and for 6 months there-
    after.
AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994                                                                                9

   3.1.7. Total Mobilization (10 USC 672 and Additional Titles 10 and 50 Emergen c y A u t h o r i -
   ties). Involves expansion of the Active Armed Forces by organizing and/or activating additional units
   beyond the existing approved force structure and the mobilization of all additional resources needed,
   including civilian facilities to round out and sustain such forces. Strength levels beyond full mobili-
   zation are determined by the President and approved by the Congress. NOTE: There is no set
   sequence to these levels of activation; each depends on the threat to US national security or to our
   Allies. The requirement to initiate volunteerism or selective mobilization usually will compel the
   review at all levels of plans and requirements to escalate the level of access to the ANGUS/USAFR
   forces (see figure 3.l).

3.2. Activation Authorities. All authority to institute activation of ANGUS/USAFR forces or Active
Duty Retirees stems from United States Code and Public Law. Emergency actions are governed by con-
gressional action, Executive Orders, federal regulations, departmental regulations and Service regulations
derived from United States Code and Public Law. Table 3.1 contains a partial list of emergency authori-
ties and summarizes SOME of the executive powers that are available in peacetime or gained commensu-
rate with a specified level of emergency. Table 3.2 illustrates some emergency responses available and
authorities for their use.

3.3. The ANGUS/USAFR Access Process:
   3.3.1. National Level. The President and the National Security Council establish national mobiliza-
   tion policies and objectives. DoD responsibilities for planning, testing, and executing mobilization
   extends from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and its staff elements to JCS and the Mil-
   itary Departments. Parallel responsibilities apply to most other federal departments and agencies.
   3.3.2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff. The organization of the JCS provides guidance to the unified and
   specified commanders and the Services concerning mobilization assumptions for operational plan-
   ning; it assesses mobilization plans, develops mobilization preparedness actions/plans, and directs the
   conduct of mobilization exercises.
   3.3.3. The Military Services. Service mobilization plans are built in support of requirements
   expressed in approved Operation Plans (OPlan) and requirements not included in OPlans. The situa-
   tion at hand determines the level of activation, from volunteerism through total mobilization, which
   responds to the most demanding operational scenario. Figure 3.2 illustrates the planning structure.
   3.3.4. Initial Actions. When a national security emergency or war is declared, several service-wide
   actions may occur, such as: (1) initiating military stop-loss actions; (2) extending terms of enlistment;
   (3) canceling leaves; and (4) curtailing nonessential training. The President may request authority
   from the Congress for required additional authorities to provide fiscal and funding guidance to the
   Services. When the President declares a national emergency, RCs may be alerted and mobilization of
   units and individuals could begin.
   3.3.5. Service Differences. While there are broad parallels in what each Service does, there are many
   differences in emphasis or methods of operations caused by their unique roles. Army manpower
   mobilization planning must provide for the reception and training of inductees. The Navy manpower
   mobilization planning must provide for the manning and support of ships at sea at increased tempos of
   operation and get those in port to sea in a combat ready state. The organization, size, and missions of
   the Marine Corps permits mobilization planning to be highly centralized in the Headquarters. Air
   Force planning needs are closely linked to its equipment inventory and mission specific Unit Type
10                                                                   AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

     Code (UTC) forces and the activation/mobilization process is amenable to strong centralized control
     at the MAJCOMs/FOAs.
     3.3.6. Other Federal Agencies:
        3.3.6.1. Other federal departments and agencies have an important role in activation/mobilization
        planning and execution. Their assignments of emergency preparedness functions are delineated in
        Executive Order 12656. The National Security Council (NSC) is assisted in the planning and exe-
        cution of mobilization and civil defense by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
        FEMA works with other federal agencies at the national and regional levels, and through regional
        offices with emergency planners in each state. The Army, as DoD executive agent for civil emer-
        gency planning at the installation level, works through local civil agencies, rather than directly
        with FEMA regional offices. Installations should refer peacetime problems with civil emergency
        planning to their higher headquarters for resolution and wartime problems to the State Area Com-
        mand (STARC).
        3.3.6.2. Two agencies of special importance to civilian personnel planners are the Department of
        Labor (DOL) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The DOL monitors national work
        force activities through its regional offices and affiliated state employment agencies. These agen-
        cies operate the local offices of the US Employment Service (USES) with federal funding support.
        The local USES offices form a national network and have the principal responsibility for recruit-
        ing workers to fill mobilization vacancies at installations and in defense industries. Some USES
        offices have state-wide data links for screening applicants, and some are tied to a national labor
        data system. The OPM is responsible for managing the federal work force for mobilization, and
        assisting in the recruitment of skilled workers.

3.4. Responsibilities, Requirements, and Resource Planning:
     3.4.1. Responsibilities for Mobilization Planning. Headquarters US Air Force (HQ USAF) is
     responsible for developing overall mobilization planning policy. Air Staff and functional managers
     and other Air Force organizations will develop guidance and procedures to provide administrative
     support to active and Selected Reserve units, individual reservists, and retirees. Air Force planning
     and programming agencies include the following:
        3.4.1.1. Operations. The Deputy Chief of Staff/Plans and Operations (HQ USAF/XO) has over-
        all responsibility for Air Force mobilization planning and readiness.
        3.4.1.2. Personnel. The Deputy Chief of Staff, Personnel (HQ USAF/DP), assisted by the Direc-
        tor, Air National Guard (NGB/CF) and Chief, Air Force Reserve (HQ USAF/RE), will manage the
        activation of ANGUS/USAFR personnel and retirees. This includes personnel support and pro-
        grams for the Total Force (AD, ANGUS/USAFR, retirees, and civilians).
        3.4.1.3. Personnel Plans. The Director of Personnel Plans (HQ USAF/DPX) has primary respon-
        sibility for activation planning, execution, guidance and procedures as they relate to volunteerism,
        recall, mobilization, sustainment, and demobilization of ANGUS, USAFR, retirees, and active
        force personnel. This is accomplished through the Personnel Readiness Division (HQ USAF/
        DPXC) and its Air Force Manpower and Personnel Readiness Center (HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC).
        3.4.1.4. Programs and Evaluations. The Director of Programs and Evaluations (HQ USAF/PE)
        is responsible for establishing manpower and organizational guidance and procedures. The proce-
        dures ensure wartime manpower mobilization requirements and authorizations (including IMA
AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994                                                                          11

     authorizations) are documented, and organizations are established using normal wartime man-
     power planning procedures.
     3.4.1.5. Air National Guard. The Director, Air National Guard (NGB/CF) participates in the
     development of guidance and procedures as they relate to volunteerism, recall, mobilization, sus-
     tainment, and demobilization and is responsible for the execution of established policies along
     with the ANGRC. Additionally, NGB/CF assists in the selection of ANGUS forces for PSRC and
     partial mobilization based upon knowledge of unit readiness, training, special capabilities, etc.
     3.4.1.6. Air Force Reserve (USAFR). The Chief, Air Force Reserve (HQ USAF/RE) partici-
     pates in the development of guidance and procedures as they relate to volunteerism, recall, mobi-
     lization, sustainment, and demobilization and is responsible for the execution of established
     policies along with Headquarters Air Force Reserve (HQ AFRES) and Headquarters Air Reserve
     Personnel Center (HQ ARPC). HQ USAF/RE, through HQ AFRES, assists in the selection of
     USAFR forces for recall and partial mobilization based upon knowledge of unit readiness, train-
     ing, special capabilities, etc.
     3.4.1.7. Medical. The Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SG) develops medical guidance for the
     mobilization of the medical service, including ANGUS/USAFR medical units, elements, and indi-
     viduals.
     3.4.1.8. Public Affairs. The US Air Force Public Affairs Program, administered by SAF/PA,
     provides guidance on the release of information to internal audiences and the media as it pertains
     to the activation of ANGUS/USAFR personnel.
     3.4.1.9. Comptroller. The Director of Budget (SAF/FMB) is responsible for the Air Force bud-
     get and providing fund citations for the execution of emergency authorities.
  3.4.2. The Planning Process:
     3.4.2.1. Requirements and resources planning is the process of assigning available personnel
     resources to activation/mobilization requirements. It includes all personnel resources: Active and
     Reserve Components, retirees, inductees, and DoD civilian employees, as well as contractors, who
     can replace in-service DoD personnel.
     3.4.2.2. Requirements and resources planning determines how to make the time-phased transition
     from the actual manning levels existing when mobilization is declared to wartime levels. Wartime
     manning must satisfy two concurrent major requirements: (1) combat units/UTCs to meet OPlan
     force commitments, and (2) sustaining and supporting activities. The initial objectives of this
     planning are to identify the numbers and skills of personnel needed in wartime and to develop and
     validate wartime requirements and priorities.
     3.4.2.3. This planning includes specific methods for filling validated wartime requirements. Mil-
     itary personnel actions upon activation/mobilization are centrally controlled through Service req-
     uisitioning and assignment systems. Civilian personnel realignment and recruitment actions are
     generally decentralized to the installation level under directives issued by the OPM.
  3.4.3. Planning Assumptions and Guidance:
     3.4.3.1. Planners require assumptions and guidelines to establish a consistent framework for their
     detailed plans.

     3.4.3.2. The principle planning document is the DoD Master Mobilization Plan. Each Service has
     a basic planning document usually augmented by subject-specific directives. The MAJCOMs
     supplement these, if necessary, or retransmit them to those affected. Attachment 1 lists major
     DoD, JCS, and Air Force guidance documents and directives concerning mobilization planning.

                                 ANGUS/USAFR ACCESS ACTIONS

4.1. Execution:
   4.1.1. The Air Force, as well as the ANGUS/USAFR, must be prepared for activation at any time.
   Planning will cover all degrees of volunteerism, callup, and mobilization in support of OPlans as well
   as plans prepared to meet needs created by crisis situations. Selected Reserve units, UTCs, and IMAs
   may be mobilized within 24 hours of notification. Upon receipt of notification, all other Reserve force
   members and retirees will start travel within 5-calendar days or as specified by the HQ USAF Crisis
   Action Team (HQ USAF/CAT).
   4.1.2. The Air Force will use the Selected Reserve through partial mobilization. Normally, involun-
   tary use of Active Duty Retirees and members of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) will be
   restricted to critical Air Force specialties.

4.2. Personnel. Tour of Duty. Members ordered to AD under mobilization authorities are normally
retained for the duration of their orders, subject to the needs of the Air Force and the nation.

4.3. Volunteerism. ANGUS/USAFR and Active Duty Retiree volunteers may be used to support any
contingency/operation when authorized by the SAF (10 USC 672(d) - ANGUS/USAFR and 10 USC 688
- retirees). Volunteers are obligated to complete the period of AD specified in their orders unless released
earlier by the commander having operational control. Once PSRC or mobilization is implemented, volun-
teers (except transiting aircrews) will not be deployed to an AOR unless they volunteer for the required
tour (established by the CINC) plus 10 days (e.g., deployment tour is 120 days - ANGUS/USAFR mem-
ber must volunteer for 130 days). The 10 days after AOR duty ensures the member will be covered by
AD for sufficient time to demobilize and/or process back into his/her unit. Volunteers must redeploy at
the end of the required tour. They are not available to the theater commander during the 10-day period.
The member may be released from AD once return processing is completed at the discretion of the
ANGUS/USAFR unit commander.
   4.3.1. Selected ANGUS/USAFR and Active Duty Retiree volunteers are ordered to AD under SAF
   authority according to guidance and procedures provided by HQ USAF/CAT-XOX during the Joint
   Crisis Action Process for each contingency operation. Once authorized, volunteers will be activated
   by the gaining MAJCOMs (GMAJCOM)/FOAs as funding is available.
       4.3.1.1. ANGUS/USAFR members whose AD orders are for at least 31 days are entitled to added
       benefits while on AD whether they serve the entire period or not.
       4.3.1.2. IRR and Standby Reserve volunteers will be activated only under 10 USC 673 and 672(a)
       as appropriate.
       4.3.1.3. Reserve Retiree volunteers will be activated only under 10 USC 672(a).
       4.3.1.4. Funds for pay and allowances are provided from the US Air Force Military Personnel
       Appropriation (MPA)(MPA funds cannot be used for retirees). Travel and per diem will be paid
       from the operation and maintenance (O&M) account of the GMAJCOM/agency.
18                                                                     AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

     4.3.2. ANGUS/USAFR volunteers will not be used if the period of AD will put the individual(s) into
     AD sanctuary (i.e., put the member(s) over 18 years of total active federal military service). See para-
     graph 6.13 for guidance.
     4.3.3. Subject to the needs of the Air Force, ANGUS/USAFR members serving on voluntary tours
     may be recalled or mobilized. A volunteer serving in a contingency outside his or her unit will not
     return to their unit for callup or mobilization without the consent of the commander who gained the
     volunteer. Commanders who gain volunteers will not delay or prohibit the return of volunteers to
     their home stations as their orders expire. Shortfalls identified at the parent unit will be filled by the
     GMAJCOM or via the filler replacement system (see AFI 36-2110 and WMP-1, Annex G).
     4.3.4. The following are some of the uses for volunteers:
        4.3.4.1. Precoordinated Specific OPlan Use. A unit required for early deployment to meet war-
        time requirements, or which has a unique capability needed for contingency operations, can prev-
        olunteer through a voluntary agreement. Access to prevolunteered ANGUS units is direct,
        because the coordination process is completed prior to the need. Courtesy notification of imple-
        mentation of prevolunteered agreements should be provided to the appropriate ANGUS/USAFR
        Volunteer Force Coordinator as soon as possible after direct access is initiated. For the ANGUS
        this preplanned specific use is clearly defined in a state agreement between the supported com-
        mand, the governor of the state involved, and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. For the
        USAFR this preplanned specific use is defined in HQ AFRES CONPLAN 93-1. The agreement
        also provides the prearranged consent of the governor that is required by 10 USC 672(d). How-
        ever, if during a plan execution, volunteers are required to augment a volunteer UTC, then NGB/
        CF/XO needs to be notified.
        4.3.4.2. Precoordinated Contingency Use. When the ANGUS/USAFR possesses a unique Air
        Force capability (i.e., one no longer maintained by the AD Air Force), the precoordinated contin-
        gency use of ANGUS/USAFR volunteers becomes a necessity.
        4.3.4.3. Contingency Use Without Prior Coordination. The mission of the ANGUS/USAFR is
        to augment the Active Air Force, and as such its volunteer forces are ready and available for use in
        contingencies at a moment’s notice. Access to contingency volunteers requires more coordination,
        but a wider range of capabilities is available.
        4.3.4.4. Extension of Duty Beyond PSRC and Mobilization Authorities Expiration.
        ANGUS/USAFR members may volunteer for AD beyond the time periods specified by other
        authorities. Voluntary extensions will not be restricted by the direction of paragraph 4.3. For
        example, an ANGUS/USAFR member may volunteer to remain on AD after his or her 180-day
        tour of duty under the PSRC (i.e., member switches from 10 USC 673b to 672(d)).
        4.3.4.5. Advance Cadres. Within 60 days before any projected date of activation, the GMAJ-
        COM commander may set up an advance cadre to expedite unit activation. Alerted unit members
        may volunteer and special orders may be published for a tour of AD to be funded from the MPA
        (reference paragraph 9.1) under AFI 36-2619.
        4.3.4.6. Action Upon Activation. Volunteers serving on AD prior to PSRC or mobilization, to
        include advance cadres, who become part of PSRC or mobilization, must be relieved from AD the
        day before the effective date on which the member is mobilized involuntarily. In levels short of
AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994                                                                            19

     full mobilization, the involuntary AD order (e.g., PSRC or partial mobilization) may also rescind
     the previous AD orders.
  4.3.5. Access Procedures. This paragraph provides the general procedures for gaining access to
  ANGUS/USAFR volunteer forces in support of contingency operations once SAF authority under 10
  USC 672(d) is granted and HQ USAF/CAT-XOX guidance provided:
     4.3.5.1. SAF 10 USC 672(d) authority and concurrences of the appropriate state adjutant general
     must be obtained by the HQ USAF/XOX and ARC representatives on the HQ USAF/CAT when
     activated.
     4.3.5.2. Normally the use of individual ANGUS/USAFR volunteers will be authorized only after
     it is determined qualified AD personnel are not available. This does not apply to aircrew mem-
     bers, operational units, operational UTCs, or standard UTCs that can be activated as volunteers by
     the owning MAJCOM with ANGUS/USAFR coordination. The intent is not to restrict com-
     mander’s deliberate planning process or execution of operations. A requesting MAJCOM or
     agency should review needs for individual ANGUS/USAFR volunteers for support of contin-
     gency operations using the following process: cross-level on the installation (consider all AD
     assets). If the requirement cannot be filled from the active force at installation level, the fill
     requirement is returned to the MAJCOM with justification why the requirement cannot be filled
     with an active asset: the MAJCOM will then cross-level within the command. If the requirement
     cannot be filled from the active force within the command, forward the fill requirement to HQ
     USAF/CAT-MPRC or if the CAT has not been activated, to HQ USAF/DPXC. This can be done
     by message or by phone with message or facsimile backup.
     4.3.5.3. HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC or HQ USAF/DPXC will coordinate with the functional man-
     ager(s), AFMPC, and the ANGUS/USAFR volunteer force coordinator(s) and approve/disapprove
     the fill request. If the request is disapproved, AFMPC will be tasked to fill from the active force.
     4.3.5.4. The requesting command will ensure the requirements are in support of contingencies/
     operations, and are validated through the command functional area, DOX, DPX, and/or Battle
     Staff. Volunteer requirements will be sent to the HQ USAF/CAT (if activated) or HQ USAF/
     DPXC and HQ USAF/XOXW. NGB/XOX, HQ USAF/REO, HQ AFRES/DOOC, ANGRC/
     DOC, ANGRC/DPA, and HQ ARPC/PRC (as appropriate) must be included as information
     addressees. This can be handled by phone with message followup. Requests for volunteers that
     do not go through the command DOX and DPX, or Battle Staff will not be considered. Requests
     for volunteers to fill surplus requirements, or requirements that can be filled from within Active
     Air Force resources, will not be approved.
     4.3.5.5. The ANGUS Volunteer Force Coordinator is NGB/XO. If the HQ USAF/CAT is in
     operation, the NGB response cell on the CAT serves as the point of contact (POC) for the ANGUS
     Volunteer Force Coordinator. If the HQ USAF/CAT has not been activated, then ANGRC/DOC
     (DSN 858-6001) serves as the single POC for the ANGUS Volunteer Force Coordinator (NGB/
     XO) on a 24-hour basis. Coordination between NGB/XO, HQ USAF/XOXW and HQ USAF/
     DPXC is required.
     4.3.5.6. The USAFR Volunteer Force Coordinator is HQ USAF/REO. If the HQ USAF/CAT is
     in operation, the USAFR response cell on the CAT serves as the focal point for the USAFR Vol-
     unteer Force Coordinator. If the HQ USAF/CAT has not been convened, then HQ AFRES/DOOC
     (DSN 497-0680) serves as the single POC for the USAFR Volunteer Force Coordinator on a
20                                                                 AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

     24-hour basis. Coordination between HQ AFRES/DOOC, HQ USAF/REO, HQ ARPC/PMC, HQ
     USAF/XOXW, and HQ USAF/DPXC is required.
     4.3.5.7. The ANGUS/USAFR Volunteer Force Coordinator along with the specific functional
     manager will evaluate the requirements, contact the appropriate units or individuals, verify/vali-
     date the availability of individuals and assess the capability of individual units or pooled resources
     of several units to meet the users requirements, and provide the requester with an estimate of the
     force availability (e.g., the time and numbers of aircraft or members available).
     4.3.5.8. The ANGUS/USAFR Volunteer Force Coordinator will obtain all requisite approvals for
     the use of ANGUS/USAFR forces (i.e., NGB/CF approval and governor consent for ANGUS
     forces and HQ USAF/RE approval for USAFR forces) after which operational control of the
     forces can be passed to the appropriate GMAJCOM/agency, supported command, or organization
     that required the forces. Follow guidance in AFI 36-2115 to ensure availability of MPA
     man-days and proper updating of the Personnel Data System (PDS) to allow for accountability.

        PRESIDENTIAL SELECTED RESERVE CALLUP AUTHORITY (10 USC 673B)

5.1. Implementation. Under 10 USC 673b, the President may direct units and members of the Selected
Reserve be ordered involuntarily to AD for up to 90 days with a possible additional 90 days without the
member’s consent.
   5.1.1. HQ USAF/CAT-XOXW will specify the effective beginning and ending dates for each incre-
   ment. The effective hour will normally be 0001 hours local. Units and UTCs may not be substituted
   unless authorized by the HQ USAF/CAT.
   5.1.2. Units, UTCs, unit members, and IMAs will be released from AD no later than the HQ USAF/
   CAT established end-of-tour date regardless of the date of entry to AD. If SAF authority has been
   obtained, individuals being released from involuntary AD may volunteer under 10 USC 672(d) to
   remain on voluntary AD if funds are available, and a valid requirement exists (see chapter 13).
   5.1.3. Members will not be ordered to AD involuntarily for less than the number of days authorized
   under PSRC.

5.2. AD Location. Unit members are ordered to AD at their home station. If an entire unit is activated, it
will be brought on AD at the assigned strength. IMAs report to their unit of assignment unless ordered
otherwise by the GMAJCOM/FOA or other authority. Members are not authorized permanent change of
station (PCS). Members may be deployed on temporary duty (TDY) in the continental United States
(CONUS) or overseas in support of mission requirements.

5.3. Unit Manning:
   5.3.1. No changes will be made to unit membership after an alert notice or an alert order has been
   issued except for:
       5.3.1.1. Transfer personnel approved for exemption.
       5.3.1.2. Expedite pending reassignment actions from the Ready Reserve or Standby Reserve
       (active status) to fill unit manning document (UMD) shortages that must be completed before the
       unit enters on AD.

5.4. Operational Control/Administrative Control:
   5.4.1. Under PSRC authority the ANGUS/USAFR will retain administrative control of unit personnel
   and IMAs, while operational control passes to the AD GMAJCOMs or agencies (see paragraph 6.8).
   5.4.2. Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Authority. The commander of the service organiza-
   tion exercising operational command to which a recalled or mobilized reservist is assigned or attached
   for duty (at the mobilized or deployed location) has concurrent nonjudicial punishment authority with
   the commander for the reservist’s element or organization of permanent assignment. The summary,
   special, and general courts-martial convening authorities of the organization to which the reservist is
   assigned or attached for duty will exercise court-martial authority.
   5.4.3. The ANGUS/USAFR MPFs continue to serve ANGUS and USAFR personnel who are ordered
   to AD under PSRC authority.
22                                                                  AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

        5.4.3.1. There is no change in normal personnel activities during the period of AD.
        5.4.3.2. Point credit earned from the AD tour is reported in the Point Credit Accounting and
        Reporting System (PCARS) through the normal update of data received from Joint Uniform Mili-
        tary Pay System (JUMPS).
        5.4.3.3. Leave is accrued and used according to AFI 36-3003, and is accounted for according to
        AFM 177-373, Volume 3.
        5.4.3.4. GMAJCOMs provide personnel to help ANGUS and USAFR MPFs, accounting finance
        offices (AFO), etc., with any temporary workload caused by the callup process. Likewise, the
        ANGUS/USAFR can upon request augment active MPFs to meet activation workload needs.
        5.4.3.5. SAF/FMBOP provides MPA fund citation to ANGUS and USAFR; TDY is paid from
        O&M funds of the supported MAJCOM or agency. AD performed under 10 USC 672(d) and
        673b will not count against the annual 139 MPA man-day AD tour limitation.
     5.4.4. DD Form 2AFACT, United States Armed Forces Identification Card, will be issued autho-
     rized members. DD Form 1173, Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card, is autho-
     rized for issue at the member’s request (completion of DD Form 1172, Application for Uniformed
     Services Identification Card DEERS Enrollment). Dependents may use a copy of sponsor’s AD
     orders with proper identification until a DD Form 1173 is issued.

5.5. Change in Statutory Authority. If the AD authority is changed from 10 USC 672(d) to 673b, or
from 673b to 673, or from 673 to 672(a) prior to the established end-of-tour date, servicing MPFs will
publish new orders under the new authority. These new orders will contain a statement that rescinds acti-
vation orders previously published effective the day before the effective date of the new order. MPFs will
ensure that there will be no break in service.

                                  ORDERING MEMBERS TO AD

6.1. Procedures for Requesting Activation/ Mobilization of ANGUS/USAFR Forces:
   6.1.1. The HQ USAF/CAT team chief will give the activation request to HQ USAF/CAT-XOXW/
   MPRC and ARC (NGB and RE) representatives for staffing.
   6.1.2. HQ USAF/CAT-XOXW/MPRC, in coordination with AFMPC, will ensure that all forces,
   active and ARC are considered before recommending approval of any activation/mobilization
   requests. Disapproved requests will be returned to the HQ USAF/CAT chief with justification/ratio-
   nale. The team chief will advise the requesting MAJCOM or agency of the disapproval and provide
   an alternative course of action for filling the shortfall.
   6.1.3. On approved requests for activation, HQ USAF/CAT-XOXW/MPRC will prepare an analysis
   and coordination sheet that will be routed through the other offices of primary responsibility (OPR)
   represented on the HQ USAF/CAT.
   6.1.4. Once all pertinent HQ USAF/CAT members have coordinated on the request for activation/
   mobilization, HQ USAF/CAT-XOXW/MPRC will prepare a Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF)
   Summary Slide, requesting approval for activation.
   6.1.5. The HQ USAF/CAT Chief will brief the CSAF and senior leadership each morning on the sta-
   tus of activated forces and provide coordinated recommendations on activating additional ANGUS/
   USAFR forces.
   6.1.6. Once CSAF approval is obtained on the request for activation, the HQ USAF/CAT Chief will
   notify the requesting MAJCOM or agency to begin activation.
   6.1.7. All requests for activation will be processed and completed within 72 hours of receipt by the
   HQ USAF/CAT.

6.2. Reporting Requirements. Current law (10 USC 672(e)) states reporting times are determined by
the SAF based on military requirements. HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC will review and propose specific
reporting times as part of any activation guidance prepared for SAF approval. A member will report at the
time specified in the activation order or by verbal order. Whenever possible, members of the Ready
Reserve will be alerted that activation/mobilization is probable. For planning purposes, units, UTCs, and
IMAs of the Selected Reserve must be available to report within 24 hours of notification. A unit’s DOC
statement response time includes this 24-hour period. PIM (IRR, Standby Reserve, and retirees) are given
at least 5-calendar days after receipt of written notification before they must begin travel.

6.3. Failure To Report. Attempts must be started immediately to locate any member who fails to report.
Additional copies of orders must be delivered in person by the member’s unit commander or a designated
representative, or by certified mail (return receipt requested must be completed when orders are delivered
by certified mail). All reasonable efforts to contact members will be documented for possible legal
action.
   6.3.1. When a member fails to reply to correspondence or to report after reasonable efforts have been
   made to make contact with him or her, the member will be reported by the organization accomplishing
   notification, as Absent Without Leave (AWOL) according to AFI 36-2911.
24                                                                    AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

     6.3.2. Members in deserter status:
        6.3.2.1. Thirty-one days after reporting a member AWOL, the servicing MPF will take appropri-
        ate action to place the member in deserter status according to AFI 36-2911.
        6.3.2.2. The servicing MPF reassigns member to HQ ARPC. Remarks section of orders indicate
        member is on AD in a deserter status. HQ ARPC is responsible for completing actions according
        to AFI 36-2911.
     6.3.3. If after 30 days it is reasonably determined that an individual reservist has no knowledge of the
     activation orders, documentation will be forwarded to the agency that issued the orders who will
     revoke them. The member will remain in the same status, coded as having a bad address, unless mem-
     ber is located and selected for later activation.
     6.3.4. When requested by AFMPC, HQ ARPC will mobilize individual reservists and retirees to fill
     vacant positions.

6.4. Transportation and Advance of Pay and Travel Allowances:
     6.4.1. Orders will include a travel fund reference and a toll free number for the servicing central
     booking and ticket office. As an alternative, if located near an Air Force Base Travel Management
     Office (TMO), the member may present orders to the TMO and make travel arrangements.
     6.4.2. Use of privately owned vehicles (POV) will not be authorized. The member will be authorized
     1-day travel and may use transportation at his or her own expense and be reimbursed at a rate that does
     not exceed the approved cost from the member’s home of record to assigned duty station. The cost of
     transportation in excess of authorized cost from home of record to assigned duty station is charged to
     the member.
     6.4.3. AFI 10-213 authorizes advance of pay and travel allowances to members ordered to AD (under
     emergency conditions). These advances may be obtained at the nearest military accounting and
     finance office or at the first AD station.
     6.4.4. Members of the Selected Reserve will be authorized emergency travel priority according to
     AFJI 24-105 (formerly AFR 75-39).

6.5. General Officers:
     6.5.1. General officers assigned to mobilized ANGUS/USAFR units are ordered to AD by the MAJ-
     COM in coordination with HQ USAF/DPG, and the unit of assignment. General officer mobilization
     assistants (MA) are ordered to AD by the MAJCOMs or HQ ARPC in coordination with HQ USAF/
     DPG. All other general officers are involuntarily ordered to AD by HQ USAF/DPG (10 USC 688 for
     Active Duty Retirees and 10 USC 673, 673b, or 672(a) for ANGUS/USAFR).
     6.5.2. General officers may volunteer for specific periods of time (139 days or less) to perform spe-
     cial projects at the invitation of HQ USAF/DPG. Active Duty Retirees will be ordered under 10 USC
     688; ANGUS/USAFR under 10 USC 672(d). Both of these authorities require SAF approval before
     activation of a general officer.
     6.5.3. Requests for fill of vacant general officer billets or for replacements will be sent to HQ USAF/
     CAT-MPRC for action. Each request, as a minimum, must contain grade, duty title, background
     required, gaining Personnel Accounting System (PAS), and date required in place. HQ USAF/DPG,
AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994                                                                                  25

   as part of the MPRC, will fill the requirement from the active resource or will direct activation of a
   general officer from the PIM; update PDS; and publish orders for movement of general officer to AD.
   Orders for activated/mobilized general officers (from the PIM) will be published at ARPC. HQ
   USAF/DPG will be provided a copy of all special orders published on general officers.

6.6. Members on AD in Support of the ANGUS/USAFR. Upon declaration of a national emergency
or war and authorized mobilization (10 USC 673 or 672(a)), members of the ANGUS/USAFR who are
already on AD to provide full-time support for their component (Active, Guard, Reserve [AGR] or tem-
porary AGR [T-AGR] status) under 10 USC 672(d) or 32 USC 502(f) are removed from their current AD
tour and placed on AD under the revised authorized title. Upon demobilization, members previously
serving under 32 USC 502(f) will be reinstated under that authority for the balance of the pre-existing
commitment.

6.7. Changes in Unit Membership:
   6.7.1. Under mobilization, changes in unit membership between the time a unit is alerted and the
   effective date of mobilization are limited to:
       6.7.1.1. Transfer of personnel approved for exemption.
       6.7.1.2. Enlistment of qualified personnel to fill an existing vacancy.
       6.7.1.3. Voluntary reassignment of personnel from a nonmobilized unit to fill an existing vacancy
       in an alerted unit as long as the readiness status of any losing unit remains C-2 or better for the per-
       sonnel graded area (AFI 10-201).
   6.7.2. Reassignment of a member to another unit is not authorized if his or her unit has been alerted
   or ordered to activate/mobilize.

6.8. Operational Control/Administrative Control:
   6.8.1. The following terms as defined in Joint Pub 1-02 apply:
       6.8.1.1. Administrative Control (DoD, NATO). Direction or exercise of authority over subordi-
       nate or other organizations in respect to administrative matters such as personnel management,
       supply, services, and other matters not included in the operational missions of the subordinate or
       other organizations.
       6.8.1.2. Combatant Command (Command Authority) (DoD). Nontransferable command
       authority established by 10 USC 164, exercised only by commanders of unified combatant com-
       mands unless otherwise directed by the President or the Secretary of Defense. Combatant com-
       mand (command authority) is the authority of a combatant commander to perform those functions
       of command over assigned forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces,
       assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction over all aspects of mili-
       tary operations, joint training, and logistics necessary to accomplish the missions assigned to the
       command. Combatant command (command authority) should be exercised through the com-
       manders of subordinate organizations; normally this authority is exercised through the Service
       component commander. Combatant command (command authority) provides full authority to
       organize and employ commands and forces as the combatant commander considers necessary to
       accomplish assigned missions. Also, called COCOM.
26                                                                     AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

        6.8.1.3. Command and Control (DoD). The exercise of authority and direction by a properly
        designated commander over assigned forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command and
        control functions are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communica-
        tions, facilities, and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating,
        and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
        6.8.1.4. Operational Chain of Command (DoD, NATO). The chain of command established
        for a particular operation or series of continuing operations.
        6.8.1.5. Operational Control (DoD). Transferable command authority that may be exercised by
        commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is
        inherent in combatant command (command authority) and is the authority to perform those func-
        tions of command over subordinate forces involving organizing and employing commands and
        forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to
        accomplish the mission. Operational control includes authoritative direction over all aspects of
        military operations and joint training necessary to accomplish missions assigned to the command.
        Operational control should be exercised through the commanders of subordinate organizations;
        normally this authority is exercised through the Service component commanders. Operational
        control normally provides full authority to organize commands and forces and to employ those
        forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish assigned mis-
        sions. Operational control does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or
        matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training. Also called OPCON.
        6.8.1.6. Tactical Control (DoD, NATO). The detailed and, usually, local direction and control
        of movements or maneuvers necessary to accomplish missions or tasks assigned. (DoD Note:
        Also called TACON.)
     6.8.2. For Administrative Control, see checklist at table 6.1.
     6.8.3. Under full mobilization, ANGUS/USAFR forces will be placed under operational and admin-
     istrative control of the REGAF.
     6.8.4. When authorities short of full mobilization are used (e.g., the PSRC, partial mobilization or
     volunteers under 10 USC 673b, 673, and 672(d) respectively), the ANGUS/USAFR will retain admin-
     istrative control of unit personnel and IMAs, while operational control passes to the AD MAJCOMs
     or agencies.
     6.8.5. Under all levels of activation IRR members and Active Duty Retirees will be placed under
     operational and administrative control of the REGAF.
     6.8.6. UCMJ Authority. The commander of the Service organization exercising operational com-
     mand to which a recalled or mobilized reservist is assigned or attached for duty (at the mobilized or
     deployed location) has concurrent nonjudicial punishment authority with the commander for the
     reservist’s element or organization of permanent assignment. The summary, special, and general
     courts-martial convening authorities of the organization to which the reservist is assigned or attached
     for duty will exercise court-martial authority.

6.9. Processing to AD:
     6.9.1. Special orders are published by the unit or ARPC according to AFI 37-128 and activation/
     mobilization guidance. See tables 6.2 and 6.3 for authority and conditions.
AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994                                                                             27

   6.9.2. Process members according to tables 6.4 and 6.5.
       6.9.2.1. Commanders and MPFs must exert all possible effort to ensure that items in table 6.4 are
       kept current so that ANGUS/USAFR members may, to every extent possible, be processed onto
       AD without the need for their personal involvement during or after activation. Unit members and
       IMAs sign in and report immediately to their duty stations without being required to spend valu-
       able time "inprocessing." Mandatory processing for individual reservists and retirees must be
       completed after reporting to their initial duty station and will include actions specified in the
       appropriate military directives.
       6.9.2.2. Items that cannot be done without the member’s direct help (e.g., current information
       known only to the member, etc.) will be completed during activation processing. The MPF will
       develop activation procedures to efficiently and incrementally process members to AD. Activa-
       tion processing should not interfere with the unit’s mission.
       6.9.2.3. Some elements of the ANGUS/USAFR (principally the IRR, Standby Reserve, Retired
       Reserve, and members who do not train with AD or ANGUS/USAFR units at least once a year)
       are simply not available to carry out preactivation requirements. Therefore, planning for such ele-
       ments must be based on the possibility that little or no activation processing will be accomplished
       in advance, and processing lines, stations, and other formal procedures must be set up in advance
       to ensure efficient, effective, and timely processing of such personnel.

6.10. MPF Support for Activated and Nonactivated Personnel. See the guidance contained in
AFMAN 36-2125.

6.11. Unit Requirements. The alert notice and/or activation guidance will include procedures for unit
fillers and command augmentation. Air Force personnel retained as a result of involuntary extension of
service (stop-loss) are applied against unit requirements before fill action is started.
   6.11.1. The GMAJCOM will man activated units at needed levels from their own resources, using
   excess personnel in other units. Future assignments of AD advisors to activated units are done
   according to GMAJCOM instructions.
   6.11.2. Unfilled requirements are combined with any other GMAJCOM personnel requirements and
   are sent to AFMPC according to AFI 10-215. Initial levy requests are prepared and sent to AFMPC
   within 5 workdays of receipt of the first notification from the ANGUS/USAFR.
   6.11.3. AFMPC determines the extent to which GMAJCOM requirements can be met from world-
   wide active force (including activated Guard and Reserve) and available PIM and nonprior service
   (NPS) resources and allocates personnel accordingly.

6.12. AD Orders. These orders cite the MPA for pay and allowances. Travel is paid from O&M funds
of the supported GMAJCOM or agency (see chapter 9).

6.13. Sanctuary for ANGUS/USAFR Personnel. This handbook contains sanctuary guidance regard-
ing ANGUS/USAFR members called to AD in support of the Active Air Force during contingency oper-
ations and exercises.
   6.13.1. AD sanctuary applies to all ANGUS/USAFR officers and enlisted members (10 USC 1006
   and 1163(d)). “Sanctuary” means that any officer or ANGUS/USAFR enlisted member who attains
28                                                                   AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

     18 (but less than 20) years of AD while serving on AD (other than for training) must be retained on
     AD unless he or she: voluntarily separates; is medically disqualified for continued service; or is sep-
     arated or discharged for cause.
     6.13.2. Servicing personnel offices must monitor assigned ANGUS/USAFR members and/or estab-
     lish procedures to identify those members approaching sanctuary. Personnel offices notify command-
     ers and assist commanders with the following procedures:
        6.13.2.1. ANGUS/USAFR volunteers will not be used if the period of AD will put the individ-
        ual(s) into sanctuary. Exceptions can be approved by the gaining Air Force MAJCOM with the
        commander’s recommendation and ANGRC, AFRES, or ARPC (as appropriate) concurrence.
        The approving Air Force organization will be cited in a statement on the individual’s AD orders as
        follows: “Individual will enter active duty(AD) sanctuary during this tour. His/her call to AD is
        approved by (approving Air Force organization).”
        6.13.2.2. Upon call to involuntary duty, each ANGUS/USAFR member who may enter sanctuary
        during the ordered period of AD will be identified to the administrative command (ANGRC,
        AFRES, ARPC), who will monitor each member’s sanctuary status.
        6.13.2.3. ANGUS/USAFR members who attain sanctuary will remain in their AD status until
        deactivation/demobilization and unit reconstitution, as appropriate. Upon completion of their tour
        (at home station), each member will be given the opportunity to separate from AD. Members who
        decline to separate will be reported to AFMPC for immediate accession into the Active Air Force
        and made available for worldwide assignment at the discretion of the Air Force.

6.14. Ordering Individuals to AD (Excluding Centrally Managed IMAs):
     6.14.1. When full mobilization is authorized by HQ USAF, MAJCOMs and agencies may order their
     assigned IMAs to AD. For activations less than full mobilization, the ordering of IMAs to AD will
     remain within the constraints of the approved activation force list; or in the case of volunteers as
     approved by the HQ USAF CAT ANGUS/USAFR Volunteer Force Coordinator.
     6.14.2. MAJCOMs will immediately input the appropriate transaction identity code (TIC) (IMA TIC
     464 PSRC, TICs for mobilization).
     6.14.3. IMAs may be ordered to report through verbal orders or the commander (VOCO). TICs are
     input to match VOCOs.
     6.14.4. For full mobilization, HQ ARPC is responsible for forwarding the master personnel record to
     AFMPC and the field records group to the gaining MPF. HQ ARPC decides, with HQ AFMPC con-
     currence, which MPFs will be responsible for IMAs assigned to external agencies and organizations.
     Members are processed to AD according to tables 6.4 and 6.5.
     6.14.5. In the event PDS is not available, alternative procedures apply. MAJCOMs and agencies will
     request activation of IMAs by message. HQ ARPC will publish and distribute special orders.
     6.14.6. Procedures for ordering IMAs assigned to an overseas command who reside and report in the
     overseas area are as follows:
        6.14.6.1. Overseas GMAJCOMs will notify and may verbally order IMAs to report.
        6.14.6.2. GMAJCOMs will maintain notification plans for expeditious alerting.
AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994                                                                                29

      6.14.6.3. HQ ARPC will ship records and publish and distribute special orders according to para-
      graphs 6.14.4 and 6.14.5.
   6.14.7. When authorized by HQ USAF, or on request of a GMAJCOM or agency, HQ AIA/RE will
   alert or order Air Force Intelligence IMAs to AD by the quickest method and input activation TICs.
   6.14.8. IMAs are selected for AD by the MAJCOM of assignment. A Reserve mobilization order is
   computer generated to ARPC when TIC 464 is input by the assigned MAJCOM and processes at
   AFMPC. Travel and per diem are paid from O&M funds of the supported GMAJCOM (see chapter
   9).

6.15. Ordering Centrally Managed IMAs to AD:
   6.15.1. These IMAs (chaplain, judge advocate general (JAG), and medical personnel) are centrally
   assigned to and managed by HQ ARPC. In the event of a directed full mobilization, HQ ARPC orders
   IMAs to positions as requested by the GMAJCOMs and/or agencies.
   6.15.2. MAJCOMs possessing Intelligence IMAs centrally managed and assigned by AIA, will fol-
   low the provisions of paragraphs 6.15.1 through 6.15.5. Overseas MAJCOMs will arrange recall pro-
   cedures through AIA.
   6.15.3. In less than a directed full mobilization, MAJCOMs may request, through HQ USAF/CAT,
   the fill of specific positions. This will be accomplished during force list refinement and at full mobili-
   zation by a message to HQ USAF/CAT (information to HQ ARPC/PRC) stating the position, required
   AFSC (to include prefix and suffix), grade, unit of assignment (PAS code), and reporting date.
   6.15.4. Upon activation, MAJCOMs may request additional resources.
   6.15.5. The appropriate central manager at HQ ARPC will coordinate the flow of the activation TIC
   with the ARPC MPF.
   6.15.6. HQ USAF/JA concurs or nonconcurs with judge advocate personnel selections according to
   10 USC 806.
   6.15.7. HQ USAF/SG (Medical) and HQ USAF/HC (Chaplain) will approve/disapprove requests for
   their centrally managed IMAs.

6.16. Ordering IMAs Assigned to Joint Positions, Unified Commands, and Ex ternal Agencies to
AD:
   6.16.1. The Air Force has IMAs who are assigned to OSD, the Joint Staff, unified commands, and
   external agencies. The HQ ARPC/DRM will input appropriate activation TIC transactions and pub-
   lish special orders when directed by HQ USAF/CAT (see paragraph 6.16.2.3). Subsequent para-
   graphs outline procedures. Unless there is a prior agreement between HQ USAF and joint and
   external organizations, HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC coordinates on activation requests that are processed
   through the HQ USAF/CAT. IMAs assigned to these organizations will not be reassigned or ordered
   to AD to support other Air Force requirements without the approval of the assigned organization and
   the HQ USAF/CAT. Any assignment changes directed by HQ USAF/CAT constitutes organizational
   concurrence.
   6.16.2. PSRC and mobilization procedures for IMAs assigned to joint and external positions are as
   follows:
30                                                                   AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

        6.16.2.1. The HQ USAF/CAT initiates a force list refinement process just prior to a PSRC and/or
        partial mobilization and ensures that joint/external IMA requirements are considered for possible
        inclusion on the force list. A force list is not required for full or total mobilization.
        6.16.2.2. The HQ USAF/CAT validates and, in coordination with the Joint Staff, approves or dis-
        approves units and IMAs for the force list, and advises the joint/external organizations. IMAs will
        be identified on the force list by Air Force specialty code (AFSC), joint position number, and gain-
        ing PAS.
        6.16.2.3. Upon receipt of a PSRC and/or partial mobilization authority, joint/external IMAs will
        be called or mobilized as stated in the tailored force list, or as directed by HQ USAF/CAT.
           6.16.2.3.1. Only the HQ USAF/CAT will order the activation of joint/external IMAs. Any
           request out of this channel will be brought to the attention of the HQ USAF/CAT immediately.
           HQ USAF/CAT will notify the command or agency and ARPC of authorized activation
           authority. The command or agency will telephonically notify members. ARPC will work
           with the members to plan travel and process special orders and associated system update.
           6.16.2.3.2. HQ ARPC will take appropriate action to activate joint/external IMAs (except
           IMAs in paragraph 6.16.2.3.3) as reflected in the tailored force list and advise the appropriate
           joint/external organization, with information to AFMPC/PRC, on the action taken. HQ
           ARPC/DRM will publish and distribute special orders and input the appropriate activation/
           mobilization TIC transactions.
           6.16.2.3.3. HQ ARPC will take appropriate action to activate or mobilize Selective Service
           System (SSS) IMAs immediately upon receipt of authority and advise the SSS with informa-
           tion to AFMPC/PRC, of the action taken. In addition, under any emergency authority, HQ
           ARPC will identify vacant SSS IMA positions to AFMPC/PRC for possible fill. HQ ARPC/
           CRPO will publish and distribute special orders and input the appropriate activation/ mobiliza-
           tion TIC transactions.
           6.16.2.3.4. For full or total mobilization, HQ ARPC will mobilize all joint/external IMAs to
           their preassigned locations immediately upon receipt of the mobilization authority or as
           directed by the HQ USAF/CAT. Guidance will be contained in the mobilization execution
           message.
           6.16.2.3.5. AFMPC/PRC, as directed by the HQ USAF/ CAT, will fill vacant joint/external
           IMA positions, using the current Joint Table of Mobilization Distribution (JTMD) listing in
           the World Wide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS) to identify vacant posi-
           tions.
     6.16.3. Procedures for Ordering National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP) IMAs to AD:
        6.16.3.1. The Director, FEMA, or the designated representative, may request military support
        through United States Atlantic Command (USACOM), the DoD Executive Agent for Military
        Support to Civil Defense (MSCD).
        6.16.3.2. Determination of Air Force IMAs (Air Force Emergency Preparedness Liaison Offic-
        ers) required to meet NSEP requirements will be made by the Air Force NSEP Director who is
        located at USACOM.
AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994                                                                               31

       6.16.3.3. Air Force Emergency Preparedness Liaison Officers must be included in the PSRC or
       partial mobilization force lists. Requirements will be forwarded from the Air Force NSEP Direc-
       tor to HQ USAF/CAT for approval and submission to the Joint Staff.
       6.16.3.4. Upon approval of the force list and authorization for activation through the Joint Staff,
       the Air Force NSEP Director will notify IMAs through the NSEP activation communication chan-
       nels. HQ ARPC MPF will publish and distribute special orders ordering the individuals to AD
       and input the appropriate activation/mobilization TIC transactions.

6.17. Ordering PIM to AD. When authorized by the HQ USAF/CAT, individuals of the PIM resource
(IRR, Standby Reserve, Retired Reserve and Active Duty Retirees) may be ordered to AD involuntarily to
meet combat theater or CONUS sustainment needs. Members of the Standby Reserve and Reserve retir-
ees are not ordered involuntarily unless the Congress has declared a national emergency and 10 USC
672(a) authority has been received. Active Duty Retirees are ordered to AD according to 10 USC 688.

6.18. Basic Military Training (BMT). Air Force members are not ordered overseas without completing
12 weeks of AD basic training or equivalent (e.g., technical school plus AD on-the-job training [OJT]).
Completed military professional training of chaplains, legal, and medical corps officers, when certified by
their respective functional managers, satisfies this requirement.

6.19. Personnel Awaiting Entry Into or Attending Air Force or Other Service S c h o o l s . S o m e
ANGUS/USAFR personnel are not immediately available for activation because they are attending or
awaiting entry into formal training. Their disposition will be as follows:
   6.19.1. Members receiving Air Force training, BMT, technical training, officer training school
   (OTS), resident professional military education (PME), or UPT/UNT will normally remain in training
   for the duration of training. Disposition of members in training provided by other Services will be
   included in the activation order.
       6.19.1.1. Unit Assigned Members. If the unit is activated/mobilized, the servicing MPF rescinds
       active duty for training (ADT) orders and publishes special orders assigning members TDY to the
       technical training center or a facility providing training for the duration of training.
       6.19.1.2. IMAs. HQ ARPC rescinds Reserve ADT orders if the GMAJCOM or agency mobilizes
       the IMA. If the IMA is not activated by the MAJCOM or agency, the IMA will continue in train-
       ing and be returned to Reserve status upon completion of training. If the IMA is mobilized, the
       member will continue in training or return to duty as determined by the GMAJCOM or agency.
       HQ ARPC publishes mobilization orders with no break in service.
   6.19.2. Unit members who are awaiting entry into technical training schools, OTS, UPT, or UNT will
   be ordered to AD with their unit. Special orders for permanent change of assignment (PCA) or TDY
   to receive training are published for the date specified, unless directed otherwise. These projected unit
   losses will be reported to the GMAJCOM Battle Staff (BS) or CAT.
   6.19.3. Members attending training during or subsequent to the mobilization of their unit of assign-
   ment will become available for world wide assignment according to Air Force policy.
   6.19.4. NPS enlisted personnel awaiting BMT or technical training will report as scheduled if report-
   ing date is within 60 days of unit’s mobilization. NPS individuals with original reporting dates within
   61 to 180 days of the unit’s mobilization will be provided adjusted reporting dates by the HQ USAF/
32                                                                   AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

     CAT. Technical training for the career field in which the member enlisted should be honored. How-
     ever, members awaiting training in skills for which a wartime surplus exists may be reclassified and
     assigned according to Air Force needs. Reserve orders are rescinded and special orders published
     assigning the member to the facility providing training. NPS members without reporting dates will be
     ordered to training against the next available BMT or technical school class.
     6.19.5. Members receiving training in a TDY status are ordered to AD with their unit.
     6.19.6. Active Force Delayed Entry Program (DEP). Active force NPS enlistees in the DEP will
     report as scheduled, unless they are advised otherwise through their local recruiter according to HQ
     USAF guidance and HQ AETC training capabilities.

6.20. Grade and Date of Rank (DOR). Table 6.6 specifies the grade and DOR in which a member may
be ordered to AD.

6.21. Aviation Service:
     6.21.1. Rated officers who possess valid aeronautical orders, and who are assigned against aircrew
     positions or possess rated primary Air Force specialty codes (PAFSC), are ordered to AD on flying
     status.
     6.21.2. Aeronautical orders published before activation remain in effect during AD.
     6.21.3. Nonunit-assigned reservists or retirees ordered to AD to perform in a rated Air Force specialty
     will have their aeronautical orders revalidated according to AFI 11-402 at the Flight Management
     Office (FMO) of the gaining AD organization or enroute inprocessing facility.
     6.21.4. AFI 36-2101, AFMAN 36-2105, AFMAN 36-2108, and AFI 11-402 contain more informa-
     tion on procedural guidance.

6.22. Change in Statutory Authority. If the AD authority changes from 10 USC 672(d)(voluntary) or
673b to 10 USC 673 or 672(a), the Guard or Reserve will publish new orders to reflect the new activation
authority and period of service. A statement rescinding previous activation orders will be included in the
new orders. If the member has been mobilized and the tour changes from 10 USC 673 to 672(a), the ser-
vicing AD MPF will amend mobilization orders to reflect issued, rescinded, or amended to ensure no
break in service.

NOTES:
1. DOR is established according to AFI 51-604. Credit is also given to retirees for each 6 months of AD or participation in a
Ready Reserve program subsequent to entry on retired status (AFI 36-3203).
2. Member must execute NGB Form 337, Oath of Office (which may be obtained from local ANG MPF). Federal recognition
proceedings are processed through normal ANGUS channels after entry on AD.
3. Members must have been recommended for appointment by an appointed federal recognition board. They may be tendered
a temporary appointment in the Air Force (by direction of the President) in the same grade they hold in the ANGUS of the
State. Appointments are issued by the Department of the Air Force and tendered by the commander publishing AD orders.
4. Members not fully qualified will be given a grade and DOR according to AFI 36-2002 or AETCR 33-2.

                                   PUSH-PULL MOBILIZATION

7.1. Push-Pull. Push-Pull is the method of accelerating the mobilization of selected members of the PIM
resource (IRR, Standby Reserve, and retirees) in anticipation of their need to fill wartime requirements.
The Push-Pull process is intended to supplement the normal requirements based mobilization process
(i.e., mobilization to meet requirements only as they become known) and will be employed only when
determined to be appropriate by the HQ USAF/CAT. However, in a major contingency involving large
deployments, the vast majority of the PIM will be brought on AD through Push-Pull mobilization.

7.2. Factors for Activation. Normally, Push-Pull will not be recommended unless the following factors
are present relative to the contingency for which the HQ USAF/CAT has been activated:
   7.2.1. Large deployments of Air Force forces are required accompanied by expected personnel short-
   ages.
   7.2.2. Shortages can be predicted in terms of AFSC, quantity, and timing (e.g., an additional 1,800
   Security Police (3PXXX) are needed during the first 60 days after mobilization).
   7.2.3. PIM resources represent the best source of personnel to satisfy the projected shortages.
   7.2.4. SAF authority under 10 USC 688 to activate Active Duty Retirees has been or is expected to be
   granted.
   7.2.5. Partial or full mobilization has been or is expected to be granted.

7.3. Procedures for Developing a Push-Pull Recommendation:
   7.3.1. Upon activation of the HQ USAF/CAT, the HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC will immediately take
   action to convene the Manpower, Personnel, and Training (MPT) working group to assess the
   Push-Pull implications of the contingency under way. Membership in this working group will
   include, but not be limited to, representatives from HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC, XOXW, XOOO, PER,
   DPPP, and DPPE; the intelligence community; and the functional OPRs of the major shortfall skills
   (i.e., those skills identified or predicted by the WARPLAN System). The HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC
   representative will chair the working group and deliver its recommendations to the HQ USAF/CAT
   Chief.
   7.3.2. Using the criteria in paragraph 6.17, the MPT working group will make a preliminary recom-
   mendation to either pursue Push-Pull implementation or employ standard mobilization procedures
   (i.e., requirements based mobilization).

7.4. Implementation. If implementation of Push-Pull is recommended, the following procedures apply:
   7.4.1. The MPT working group will determine specific AFSCs to be involved in the Push-Pull imple-
   mentation and the estimated time phasing of these requirements.
   7.4.2. This initial estimate of shortages will be provided to AFMPC/PRC, HQ ARPC/PRC, and HQ
   AETC/CCR. AFMPC will also be advised of any resource and requirements assumptions that were
   employed in the shortfall calculations (e.g., PIM resources that were or were not considered on the
   supply side).
46                                                                  AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

        7.4.2.1. AFMPC will review the projected shortages and provide comments to the HQ USAF/
        CAT-MPRC regarding the viability of the shortfall numbers and the proposed implementation of
        push-pull mobilization.
        7.4.2.2. HQ ARPC, using the skill usability windows developed by HQ USAF functional manag-
        ers, will categorize PIM in AFSCs identified as either PIM Requiring Training (PIM-RT) or as
        PIM-Directed Duty Assignment (PIM-DDA). The number of personnel in each of these catego-
        ries, for all AFSCs identified, will be forwarded to HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC, AFMPC/PRC, and
        HQ AETC/CCR. HQ ARPC will also use the initial notification to begin their planning for
        Push-Pull implementation.
        7.4.2.3. HQ AETC will make a preliminary assessment of its ability to process the number of PIM
        identified by the MPT working group and advise the HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC of potential limiting
        factors. HQ AETC will also advise AFMPC and HQ ARPC of the specific training center (TC)
        processing sites that will be used for each AFSC (including non-AETC-owned sites) and the time
        phased processing capacity of each of the sites. Additional support requirements (i.e., equipment,
        instructors, etc.) should also be brought to the attention of the HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC as soon as
        possible.
     7.4.3. Based upon inputs from AFMPC, HQ ARPC, and HQ AETC, the MPT working group pre-
     pares a final Push-Pull recommendation for the HQ USAF/CAT Chief for review and approval or dis-
     approval.
     7.4.4. Upon approval of a recommendation to implement Push-Pull, AFMPC, HQ ARPC, and HQ
     AETC are immediately provided detailed implementation guidance by the HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC.
     Detailed implementation guidance will contain, as a minimum, a flow schedule (in 10-day incre-
     ments) of PIM (both PIM-DDA and PIM-RT) by processing site, by AFSC, by PIM category (IRR,
     Standby Reserve, Retired). The following actions are taken as soon as necessary mobilization author-
     ities are granted:
        7.4.4.1. AFMPC advises HQ ARPC, through the automated Mobilization Filler System (or by
        other appropriate means, if that system is not operational), of those PIM to be mobilized directly
        to the training sites or other specific CONUS locations. AFMPC also begins to develop and flow
        end assignments for PIM-DDA to the processing sites. These assignments will be flowed to the
        appropriate training site and will be timed to pull the PIM-RT upon completion of training or
        assignment availability information provided by HQ AETC.
        7.4.4.2. HQ ARPC will take action to mobilize and direct the reporting of PIM according to
        instructions received from AFMPC via the mobilization filler system or other appropriate means
        (if that system is not operational). In addition, development and disposition of master personnel
        records for mobilized PIM will be accomplished according to AFMAN 36-2125, AFPAM
        36-2126, and this handbook. ARPC will handle any delay/exemption request and identify
        replacements as appropriate.
        7.4.4.3. HQ AETC immediately report all arriving PIM (DDA or requiring training) to AFMPC,
        HQ ARPC, and HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC through the PDS or other expeditious means. This notice
        will advise of the projected assignment availability of each PIM resource. Those arriving PIM
        determined to be unsuitable for service (medical, etc.) will be reported to HQ ARPC by the most
        expeditious means for replacement action. The processing site will take necessary action to demo-
        bilize unsuitable individuals. Processing of personnel at the training sites will be according to
AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994                                                                              47

     guidance contained in AFMAN 36-2125, AFPAM 36-2126, AFI 36-2608, HQ AETC, and this
     handbook. As a minimum, processing must provide the basis for the service suitability decision
     and the determination of an assignment availability date reported to AFMPC. In addition, for PIM
     being assigned from the training sites to overseas locations, processing will also need to provide
     for completion of necessary combat training and equipping, which includes military clothing
     issue. This will be done after the member has been declared suitable for military service.
     7.4.4.4. Following the completion of the first Push-Pull cycle (i.e., when service suitability deci-
     sions have been made for all PIM initially mobilized to either processing sites or directly to units),
     AFMPC will advise the HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC of Push-Pull effectiveness in terms of producing
     resources to offset projected shortfalls. In addition, AFMPC will, if appropriate, make recommen-
     dations to the HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC regarding other resource management actions that may be
     necessary if Push-Pull has not produced sufficient resources.
     7.4.4.5. Additional guidance, necessary to implement the Push-Pull process, will be developed,
     coordinated, and published by the appropriate offices within AFMPC, HQ ARPC, and HQ AETC.

                                               STOP-LOSS

8.1. Stop-Loss Implementation. Title 10 USC 673c permits the President to suspend (Stop-Loss) any
provision of law relating to promotions, retirements, and separations during any period when members of
any Reserve component are on AD under involuntary PSRC or mobilization authorities.

8.2. Authority and Actions. The Air Force routinely seeks Stop-Loss authority when members of the
ARC are, or will be placed on AD involuntarily. When Stop-Loss authority is provided, HQ USAF/
CAT-MPRC takes the following actions:
     8.2.1. Immediately directs the temporary suspension (for up to 30 days) of all voluntary separations,
     discharges, resignations, and retirements of Regular and ANGUS/USAFR members of the Air Force
     whose enlistments, appointments, periods of AD, periods of obligated service, or other military status
     would otherwise expire during the period of AD specified.
     8.2.2. May grant emergency leave or hardship to members on AD. Will not reassign Members of the
     Ready Reserve and Standby Reserve to a resource pool of lesser availability (e.g., Selected Reserve to
     the Standby Reserve). Will contact members who have departed their home station on terminal leave
     at their home of record as soon as guidance has been provided.
     8.2.3. Within 30 days, develops specific loss management policy which will minimize experienced
     personnel losses and maximize Air Force’s capability to sustain operations. Stop-Loss guidance will
     address the following subjects:
        8.2.3.1. Disability separations or retirements (AFI 36-3203).
        8.2.3.2. Mandatory retirements (AFI 36-3203).
        8.2.3.3. Voluntary and involuntary separations and discharges, including extreme personal hard-
        ship (AFIs 36-3207, 36-3208, and AFI 36-3209).
        8.2.3.4. Discharge in lieu of court-martial (AFI 36-3208 and AFI 36-3209).
        8.2.3.5. Discharge by reason of conscientious objector status (AFIs 36-3204 and 36-3208).
        8.2.3.6. ARC and AD retired members on AD.
        8.2.3.7. Disposition of Ready Reserve and Standby Reserve members not on AD.
        8.2.3.8. Effective period (e.g., 2 years; duration plus 6 months; etc.).
        8.2.3.9. Disposition of AD members on terminal leave.
        8.2.3.10. Specific categories if less than total Stop-Loss is needed.

                                    DELAY AND EXEMPTION

10.1. Delay and Exemption. Delay is a postponement of not more than 30 days in reporting to AD.
Exemption is the total relief from the order to AD.
   10.1.1. Officers (unless retired) requesting exemption must tender their resignations according to AFI
   36-2115 or AFI 36-3209.
   10.1.2. Airmen (unless retired) with an approved exemption will be discharged according to AFI
   36-3209.
   10.1.3. Approval authority (see table 10.1) for delays and exemptions is as follows:
      10.1.3.1. ANGUS/USAFR unit commander for unit assigned members.
      10.1.3.2. HQ ARPC/CC for IMAs assigned to the chaplain, medical, legal career fields, Air Force
      Element IMAs, individual reservists (not unit assigned), and retirees.
      10.1.3.3. MAJCOM Reserve Affairs Office for MAJCOM assigned IMAs.
      10.1.3.4. Intelligence IMAs through the GMAJCOM Reserve Affairs Office, the commander of
      an FOA or the AIA Reserve Affairs Office for IMAs that will be gained by the United States Air
      Forces in Europe (USAFE) or Pacific Air Forces (PACAF).

10.2. Processing Procedures:
   10.2.1. Requests are approved or disapproved within 24 hours of receipt or the approving authority
   advises member of any documentation required (see table 10.2). If additional time is required to
   assemble documentation needed to make a determination, a delay of 7-calendar days may be granted
   to enable member to obtain required documentation. Short delays (normally not to exceed 30 days)
   for professional members (medical, chaplain, legal) should be favorably considered to allow member
   to arrange coverage for the practice or parish.
   10.2.2. Immediately upon receipt of a request for delay or exemption the approval authority or desig-
   nated action office will input the necessary transaction, through PDS to DJMS-RC, to hold their pay
   action until the case is finalized.
   10.2.3. Immediately upon disapproval of a request for delay or exemption, the member is notified to
   comply with the orders and is required to report within 24 hours. Verbal notification is permissible.
   However, written notification is required as a followup and must be sent certified mail. DJMS-RC
   must be notified of disapproved requests. The approval authority or designated action office will
   input necessary transactions through PDS to DJMS-RC to reactivate pay action.
   10.2.4. Immediately upon approval of a request for delay or exemption (including temporary delay
   awaiting documentation), the approval authority will notify the MPF and the member. The appropri-
   ate MPF will input transactions through PDS to DJMS-RC to hold pay action until the case is final-
   ized. PDS action notices will be produced every 30 days requiring the approval authority (or
   designated action office) to review the case to determine whether another delay of 30 days is war-
   ranted, exemption action is required, or assignment to a pool of lesser availability is prudent. The
   approving authority initiates separation actions.

NOTES:
1. Delay is mandatory.
2. Documentary evidence from at least two disinterested parties must show that reservist’s dependents
would suffer an extreme hardship greater than other members can expect to experience if called to AD.
Evidence for a member registered with the Selective Service may include a recommendation by the State
Director of Selective Service.
3. Approval of delay or exemption is conditional based on documented severity of claimed hardship.
4. Documentary evidence from at least two community officials must show that the member’s withdrawal
from a particular community in a national emergency would have a substantial adverse effect on the
health, safety, or welfare of that community. The HQ USAF/CAT is consulted as needed to assist in the
resolution of problem cases.

                                          ENTITLEMENTS

11.1. Entitlements. ANGUS/USAFR personnel and retirees on volunteer tours of 31 days or more, and
those recalled or mobilized, are due entitlements as provided by law.
   11.1.1. Air Force guidance is that there will be no difference in the application of entitlement autho-
   rizations unless prescribed by law or other applicable directives.
   11.1.2. The message announcing activation or mobilization of ANGUS/USAFR forces and/or Active
   Duty Retirees, will include any authorized deviations from published guidance and regulations, and
   current entitlements/benefit guidance, to include a recap on entitlement to special allowances/statutes,
   such as field duty/essential unit messing, family separation allowance (FSA), foreign duty pay, immi-
   nent danger pay, variable housing allowance, leave accrual (carry over), tax exclusions, etc.

11.2. Implementation and Coordination. When a contingency is beginning to build, HQ USAF/
CAT-MPRC will take necessary action to consider and coordinate the following items:
   11.2.1. Waiver of the 20-week rule on PCS status (a primary determining factor for entitlements and
   benefits).
   11.2.2. Authorization of special storage of household goods (AFH 24-502, and JFTR, Volume 1,
   paragraph U4700 B3).
   11.2.3. Authorization of TDY household goods (JFTR,
   Volume 1, paragraph U4705).
   11.2.4. Movement of dependents under indeterminate TDY (JFTR, Volume 1, paragraph U4600)
   orders.
   11.2.5. Special pay for recalled or mobilized professional personnel.
   11.2.6. Field duty/essential unit messing determination.

11.3. Entitlements Upon Deactivation. Prior to deactivation/demobilization, HQ USAF/CAT-MPRC
will take action to coordinate processing of indebtedness and special authorities to request remission or
waiver of outstanding debts. All efforts should be made to complete these actions prior to making the
decision to begin deactivation/demobilization actions.

11.4. Unit Welfare Funds. The gaining MAJCOM or agency is responsible for distributing unit welfare
funds to and for its activated ANGUS/USAFR units. Activated units are entitled to distribution of welfare
funds on the same basis as active units under jurisdiction of the MAJCOM involved. The funds distrib-
uted to and for activated units are distributed according to AFI 34-302, and accounted for according to
AFJI 34-210, as supplemented by gaining MAJCOMs. Disposition of welfare funds acquired by units
before their mobilization will be according to ANGR 34-3 and AFI 34-302.

                                                SYSTEMS

12.1. Personnel Data Systems (PDS). AFMPC/PRC, in coordination with AFMPC/DPMDSM, directs
the scheduling of special updates and programs to expedite the generation and processing of transactions
related to volunteerism, PSRC, and mobilization. Daily updates of PDS, both base level and Headquar-
ters Air Force (HAF) are crucial and required throughout the activation process.
     12.1.1. PAS System for Units Under PSRC/Partial Mobilization in Place:
        12.1.1.1. See table 12.1 for PDS actions for volunteerism.
        12.1.1.2. When the decision is made to recall units, each MAJCOM PAS manager inputs the per-
        sonnel transaction identifier (PTI) PPZ04 transactions for each unit selected for the PSRC/partial
        mobilization in place. Format and additional instructions are published in AFMAN 36-2621 and
        table 12.2 in this handbook.
        12.1.1.3. PPZ04 transactions processed to the PAS master file produce output transactions to the
        ANGUS or USAFR master personnel files. Output transactions (XXZ58) against these master
        personnel files produce a 464 output transaction to base level for each member assigned to that
        unit. In addition, the LIM-MOB-EFF-DT, LIM-MOB-EXP-DT, and RESRV-AD-REASON are
        updated to the individual’s master personnel file record but no transfer of data to the active files
        (AA/BA) is required. A mobilization history stub record is generated and loaded to the mobiliza-
        tion history file (FRH) for ATLAS inquiry processing.
        12.1.1.4. In order to exempt/release individual PSRC records, units must submit a PTI 465 for
        each exempt record via personnel transactions (PERSTRANS). If a complete unit requires a
        PSRC reversal/release, a PPZ04 must be submitted to the MAJCOM via PERSTRANS. The
        information in this transaction, normally containing dates and the reason (RESRV-AD-REASON)
        for the PSRC must be left blank except for the control data (positions 1-27).
     12.1.2. PAS System for Units Under Full Mobilization Only:
        12.1.2.1. When the decision is made to mobilize selected units, each GMAJCOM PAS Manager
        inputs the appropriate PTI (PPZ03 or PPZ05) transaction to update the PAS system. Format and
        additional instructions are published in AFMAN 36-2125 (formerly AFM 30-3, Volume 4) and
        table 12.3 in this handbook. HAF Encode/Decode Table 723 lists the active duty
        PAS-CBPO-NRs that will be assigned to the ANGUS/USAFR unit at the time the transaction is
        processing in the PAS update.
           12.1.2.1.1. The EAD-DATE, minus 1 day, is the effective date of separation
           (RET-SEP-EFF-DATE-PROJ) from non-EAD status, which is the controlling element. Does
           not apply to PSRC.
           12.1.2.1.2. The date of separation (DOS) required in the PPZ03 and PPZ05 transaction for full
           mobilization (10 USC 672) is duration plus (+) 6 months.
           12.1.2.1.3. RESRV-AD-REASON (officer and airman) will always be code "C" (exercise).
           A new code may be assigned by AFMPC/PRC prior to a PSRC or mobilization. A message
           specifying a new code will be transmitted to all concerned by AFMPC/PRC.
AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994                                                                                57

      12.1.2.2. PTI PPZ03 and PPZ05 transactions processed to the ANGUS or USAFR master person-
      nel files, MAJCOMs, MPFs, plus a "PAS Change Listing" for internal use by AFMPC. The
      SWZ57 processed against the HAF, ANGUS or USAFR master personnel files selects individuals
      assigned to that unit, outputs a XX977 loss transaction to the base of assignment, outputs a loss
      transaction to DFAS-DE (DJMS-RC), pulls slips for record retrieval from HQ ARPC, and a
      XX091 accession transaction to the active MPF and a mobilization history record to the FRH for
      every unit member mobilized. Table 12.4 describes responsibilities and processing requirements.
          12.1.2.2.1. At the losing ANGUS or USAFR MPF, processing the PTI XX977 transaction
          causes records to be changed to a projected separation status, loss to ANGUS/USAFR file,
          gained to the AD file. The ANGUS or USAFR base level record is reconfigured to an AD
          record and loaded to the base level system. The losing ANGUS or USAFR MPF releases the
          automatically generated PTI XX992 transaction on the expiration of the effective date for sep-
          aration to mobilization.
          12.1.2.2.2. The unit commander immediately determines the status of each unit member and:
          12.1.2.2.3. Takes action to reassign members who cannot be located for delivery of AD
          orders.
          12.1.2.2.4. Loads cancellation PTI (XX975) into the Base Level Military Personnel System
          (BLMPS) for flow to HAF master personnel file for members who are exempt from mobiliza-
          tion. This, in turn will forward a cancellation (XXA01) to the active file (HAF master person-
          nel file). An ANGUS/USAFR reassignment action must follow. NOTE: Processing of the
          XX975 at the HAF master personnel file will change record status from Reserve to active.
          ANGUS unit members will be assigned to a state headquarters. USAFR members will be
          assigned to an ARPC PAS.
          12.1.2.2.5. Loads a change PTI (XX976) into BLMPS for flow to the HAF master personnel
          file for members who are delayed from mobilization for various reasons. Changes the effec-
          tive date of AD on the HAF, ANGUS, or USAFR master personnel file and flows a change
          (XXA06) PTI to the active file.

12.2. PSRC and Mobilization of IMAs and Mobilization of the PIM:
   12.2.1. General Information. The PDS procedures for callup and mobilization of individuals are
   basically the same as for members of units. Variations in detail relate to the input point of the three
   principal transactions used in the mobilization process (see table 12.4).
   12.2.2. Initiation of Volunteerism, PSRC/Partial Mobilization, Full Mobilization D a t a F l o w .
   Tables 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 prescribe the office(s) responsible for input of initiating transactions
   according to the category of individuals.
      12.2.2.1. Initiation of IMA PSRC (10 USC 673b) Data Flow. Table 12.3 prescribes the office
      responsible for the input of initiating transaction (PTI XX464) for IMAs. Initial input will consist
      of the 90-day period from the LIM-MOB-EFF-DT and that date will be placed in the LIM-MOB
      EXP-DT. An additional 90 days can be added to the PSRC requiring the submission of XX466
      containing only the initial LIM-MOB-EFF-DT from the first 90-day PSRC plus the new expira-
      tion date.
58                                                                    AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

        12.2.2.2. Initiation of IMA Mobilization Mass or Individual (10 USC 673 or 672(a)) D a t a
        Flow. Table 12.2 prescribes the office responsible for input of initiating transaction (XX979) for
        IMAs. Mass mobilization of command IMAs (FR979) only requires the submission of one trans-
        action to mobilize all command assigned IMAs to their PAS of assignment (not 3I or 0U com-
        mand). Exemptions of IMAs for a mass mobilization requires the input of a data identification
        number (DIN) data transaction, before the mass mobilization transaction is input, to load code "E"
        (exempt) to RES-RECALL-STATUS. Do not use the exemption DIN date updating for exercises.
        Central managed IMAs, excluding Intelligence IMAs, can be mass mobilized to the IMA contin-
        gency MAJCOM or IMA contingency PAS.
        12.2.2.3. Utilization of the PIM. The HAF mobilization filler system is activated by shortage
        requirements received from GMAJCOMs. The filler system will be activated by HQ USAF/
        CAT-MPRC.
     12.2.3. Flow and Effect of Data Transactions:
        12.2.3.1. Outputs (PTI XX977) from the activation filler system run against the Reserve and
        retired master personnel files. Update of these transactions to the HAF files sets record status to
        2X and establishes the projected separation date, the AD PAS to which the individual will be
        gained on separation, and the separation program designator (SPD) "LTM" applicable to mobili-
        zation.
        12.2.3.2. Accession transactions flow from the HAF Reserve and retired files to the active files
        (AA/BA) with a unique mobilization accession designation number (ADN) of "B34" for the IRR,
        "B31" for the retired AD, "B35" for the Standby Reserve, and "B36" for the retired reserve. The
        ADN and service component become critical data items at the time of demobilization in the acti-
        vated identification process.
        12.2.3.3. Output from the Reserve files consists of data flow to DJMS-AC for JUMPS, a stub
        record for accession to the FRH, accession flow to the PAS of assignment, record pull slips to HQ
        ARPC for Reserve personnel, and the MPRC for retirees. There is no PDS to Retired Pay Inter-
        face at this time. There also is no interface to DJMS-AC for retired mobilized members.
        12.2.3.4. Orders and mailgram data generated out of the Mobilization Filler System are for-
        warded to HQ ARPC for distribution to the individuals activated.
        12.2.3.5. Cancellation and changes (XX975/976) are input by HQ ARPC on the PIM personnel.
        Update of these transactions to the Reserve and retired files will revert records back to their origi-
        nal status (XX975) and change their reporting date (XX976). Cancellation and change output is
        generated to the HAF active files (AA/BA) canceling the accession (XXA01) or changing the
        effective date of the accession (XXA06).

12.3. Deactivation. When deactivation is directed, the servicing MPF is responsible for reviewing each
separation in relation to deactivation and assisting affected members in determining any selective alterna-
tive available to them. Two possible actions could result:
     12.3.1. The individuals deactivation separation is correct. The MPF inputs projected separation
     (XX977) on records identified as activated (see paragraph 12.2.3.2).
     12.3.2. Individual will remain on AD, tour is extended/updated as appropriate.
AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994                                                                               59

12.4. PDS Actions on Effective Date of Deactivation. Projected separation actions are implemented on
the effective date. Flow of projected separation transactions (XX977) from base to HAF causes the HAF
record status to change from 10 to 20. On the projected effective date, record status is changed from 20
to 81 (at HAF) to show an unconfirmed separation. Flow of data from the active file to the ANGUS/
USAFR files will occur at the time of the initial separation projection. The HAF ANGUS/USAFR record
(RS74), and the ANGUS/USAFR MPF unit accession transactions, are all activated via the PAS system
from the losing MAJCOM. At the losing MPF, a PTI 992 is generated to AFMPC confirming the separa-
tion and, once again, data is transferred to the ANGUS/USAFR files. The same procedure applies to the
PIM, except the retiree record is reestablished on the retired file. Deactivation of IMA and IRR members
can occur at their place of deployment by use of a TTI vice PTI. The transaction will flow to AFMPC and
in turn will generate a projected separation to the base level record. On the effective date of separation a
PTI AA/OA 992 will be generated from the base level system to confirm separation at AFMPC.

12.5. PSRC and Mobilization of Individuals (Members Remaining on Their Re spective Files):
   12.5.1. ANGUS/USAFR unit members and IMAs will remain on the ANGUS/USAFR files through
   partial mobilization. This could include the PSRC or mobilization of an entire ANGUS or USAFR
   unit by use of PPZ04 PAS transaction, or selected individuals by UTC (PTI 464) and volunteers (PTI
   464). When this decision is made the GMAJCOM will input the PPZ04 to mobilize the entire unit
   with PTI 464 flow to BLMPS. If ANGRC, HQ AFRES or HQ ARPC are tasked to callup or mobilize
   individuals, or provide volunteers by UTC, the owning ANGUS/USAFR MPF will input PTI 464
   which will update LIM-MOB-EFF-DT, LIM-MOB-EXP-DT, and RESRV-AF-REASON. A PTI 464
   is output from BLMPS to HAF. At HAF a mobilization history stub record is generated and loaded to
   the FRH for ATLAS inquiry processing. A transaction is generated via AUTODIN to DFAS-DE
   (DJMS-RC) for partial and (DJMS-AC) full mobilization. The RESRV-AD-REASON code identi-
   fies the type of contingency being supported (volunteerism, PSRC, mobilization).
   12.5.2. In order to exempt/release individuals mobilized while on the ARC file, the MPF must submit
   PTI 465. A transaction is generated to DFAS-DE (DJMS-RC) for partial and (DJMS-AC) for full
   mobilization to close out the pay record.
   12.5.3. A change of LIM-MOB-EXP-DT requires the submission of a PTI 466. If the
   PAS-CBPO-NR is other than S7, a PTI 466 will be generated to HAF. A stub record is generated and
   updated to the FRH. A PCARS stub record is also generated to the PCARS subsystem. If the
   RESRV-AD-REASON (officer and airman) is an "H" (partial mobilization) then a pay transaction is
   generated to DFAS-DE to change the mobilization expiration date on DJMS-RC.

12.6. Manpower Mobilization and Accession Status Report (MOBREP). Joint Pub 1-03.17 provides
report guidelines.
   12.6.1. The MOBREP provides tabulated manpower (personnel) data to the Joint Staff for use in
   monitoring the status of a mobilization or callup including volunteerism.
   12.6.2. Submission procedures will be provided by HQ USAF/CAT for contingency operations
   involving the utilization of ANGUS/USAFR forces.

                                         DEACTIVATION

13.1. General Information:
   13.1.1. When the SAF authorizes deactivation of ANGUS/USAFR forces, he or she may delegate
   that authority to the MAJCOM commanders and agencies. Not all ANGUS/USAFR members will be
   deactivated at the same time and processing actions will vary with the specific ANGUS/USAFR cate-
   gory (i.e., unit, IMA, IRR, Standby Reserve, Retirees). Deactivation processing for unit assigned
   ANGUS/USAFR personnel will be accomplished by the ANGUS/USAFR MPFs. Deactivation pro-
   cessing for IMA and PIM members will be accomplished by the AD MPFs. When personnel are
   released to home station and deactivation date is established, operational control reverts to the
   ANGUS/USAFR, unless the individual has applied for retention on AD (remain in the REGAF, med-
   ical hold, personal hardship) or the member is pending UCMJ action or serving a sentence imposed by
   court martial authority. ANGUS/USAFR members applying for sanctuary will not necessarily be
   returned to their home station.
   13.1.2. Key to smooth and successful deactivation is coordination between the AD MAJCOMs and
   the ANGUS, USAFR, AFMPC, and ARPC.

13.2. Special Orders and Travel Vouchers:
   13.2.1. Demobilization Orders are not Required. Use the demobilization date authorized by the
   applicable MAJCOM on DD Form 214 and the paid travel voucher to document deactivation.
   13.2.2. For Unit-Assigned ANGUS/USAFR Members. Travel vouchers will be processed by
   member’s home unit Financial Services Office (FSO), following normal procedures. Upon payment
   of the travel voucher, the FSO Travel Pay Section will provide a legible copy of the voucher and all
   supporting documentation to Military Pay for entitlement verification and posting. A legible copy
   must also be forwarded to the MPF servicing the member’s unit (maintaining the member’s Unit Per-
   sonnel Record Group [UPRG]) for DD Form 214 completion and filing in the UPRG.
   13.2.3. For IMA, IRR, Active Duty Retirees, Standby Reserve, and Retired Re serve. During
   the outprocessing briefing, each member must be informed of the requirement to submit a travel
   voucher for all travel from the unit to his or her final destination. Provide the member with a DD
   Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher, for all information required to complete the travel
   voucher, the phone number for the FSO Travel Pay Section, and an addressed postage paid business
   reply mail envelope to mail the voucher.

13.3. DD Form 214, Certification of Release or Discharge from Active Duty:
   13.3.1. All activated ANGUS/USAFR members and retirees (10 USC 673b, 673, 672(a), and 688)
   will be issued a DD Form 214 according to AFI 36-3202. Volunteers (10 USC 672(d) who serve 90
   consecutive days or more will be issued a DD Form 214. The member’s access to unemployment ben-
   efits, VA benefits, and future state programs are dependent on the information reflected on the DD
   Form 214. ANGUS/USAFR MPFs will accomplish DD Forms 214 for unit assigned personnel. HQ
   ARPC will accomplish DD Forms 214 for IMAs. AD MPFs will accomplish DD Forms 214 for PIM
   members. Only one DD Form 214 will be accomplished for each member and it must include all AD
   days served during the contingency operation.
64                                                                 AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

     13.3.2. AFMPC/DPMDOA will screen the recalled retirees’ records and forward copies of all previ-
     ous DD Form 214 or 215, Correction to DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from
     Active Duty, and other documentation/information available to the AD MPF separations unit. This
     will assist separations personnel in accomplishing the new DD Form 214. DD Forms 215 for recalled
     retirees will be accomplished by AD MPFs within 90 days of the member reverting to retired status.
     After 90 days, the DD Form 215 will be accomplished by AFMPC/DPMDO. MPFs will notify
     AFMPC by letter of required changes.
     13.3.3. AFI 36-3202 restricts MPFs from correcting DD Forms 214 after 90 days. That portion of the
     paragraph as applies to ANGUS/USAFR MPFs is waived for deactivation actions. ANGUS/USAFR
     MPFs may correct DD Forms 214 as long as the UPRG is available to make corrections. The require-
     ment for ANGUS/USAFR MPFs to send DD Forms 215 to HQ ARPC for distribution is waived.
     Units will make the distribution.
     13.3.4. DD Form 214, items 11, 12F, and 14. The only data required is that obtained during "contin-
     uous active military service." In other words, the total number of AD days accumulated during the
     current AD period.
     13.3.5. DD Form 214, items 12D, 12E, 13, 14, and 15A. Require considerable data collection, most
     of which cannot be immediately accomplished. The term "UNKNOWN" will not be used in blocks
     12D, 12E, 14, or 15A. Contact AFMPC/DPMDO for Active Duty Retirees and HQ ARPC/DSMR for
     all other activated personnel. Any authorized service medals for current period will be entered in
     block 13.
     13.3.6. SPD Code "T50" will be used for all ANGUS/USAFR members being demobilized. Narra-
     tive reason: ANGUS/USAFR member released due to demobilization.

13.4. Activated Retiree Actions:
     13.4.1. The orders reverting recalled retirees to retired status will be published by AFMPC/
     DPMARR2.
     13.4.2. The following vital information is required and must be provided by the assigned AD MPF
     for the issuance of the retirement reversion order:
        13.4.2.1. One copy of the member’s activation order.
        13.4.2.2. A signed statement from the member’s unit commander indicating the date the member
        will be released from the unit. The statement will be forwarded through the appropriate channels
        to AFMPC/PRC for processing.
        13.4.2.3. The assigned AD MPF must compute and provide the following:
            13.4.2.3.1. Total number of days on AD computed from extended active duty (EAD) date
            through date relieved from the unit.
            13.4.2.3.2. The number of days leave the member elects to take after departing the unit, if
            any. Contact the Military Pay Section of the local FSO to verify the number of days accrued
            leave.
            13.4.2.3.3. To assist in member’s processing through the local FSO prior to actual receipt of
            the retirement reversion orders, the MPF Separations Unit will issue an AF Form 100,
AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994                                                                        65

          Request and Authorization for Separation, for travel from the unit of assignment to the
          place called to AD.

13.5. Deactivation of IMA/PIM at TDY Location:
   13.5.1. IMA or PIM members returning from their TDY location/base to their assigned location/base
   for sole purposes of accomplishing deactivation/demobilization processing could incur personal or
   financial hardship and/or increased costs to the Air Force. Thus, TDY MPFs may request through
   their parent MAJCOM, with the concurrence of the IMA or PIM member, an exception to the deacti-
   vation/demobilization policy from AFMPC/PRC.
   13.5.2. Upon receipt of the approved request, the MPF of assignment and the MPF of attachment
   must establish good communications and work closely together and ensure the MPF of attachment
   updates PDS appropriately and according to information contained in this handbook. The TDY order
   assigning the member to the TDY location will not have to be amended by either the MPF of assign-
   ment or attachment.

13.6. Comptroller/Personnel:
   13.6.1. Close cooperation between the financial management and personnel communities, at all lev-
   els, is essential to successfully accomplish deactiva-tion/demobilization actions.
   13.6.2. Actions required prior to member’s departure from AD:
      13.6.2.1. Make every effort to provide accurate and complete separation payments to mobilized
      members. This requires a manual pay computation against the DJMS-RC since it may contain
      inaccurate EAD/DOS dates, or may not reflect all entitlements and/or leave changes.
      13.6.2.2. Validate current mailing address and direct deposit information to ensure delivery of
      future payments and personnel/pay related information.
      13.6.2.3. Reconciliation of accrued leave against annual, emergency, and terminal leave taken
      must be balanced to avoid member indebtedness.
   13.6.3. All IMA or PIM members will separate from an AD base through the local MPF and FSO.
   Unit assigned ANGUS/USAFR members will separate through their unit. In many cases, these units
   are collocated with an AD base and normal separation processing through the AD FSO will be accom-
   plished. Where the ANGUS/USAFR unit is not collocated or reasonably close to an AD FSO, the
   ANGUS/USAFR unit and the AD AFO must work closely to separate members in a timely manner
   and ensure accurate separation/travel payments.

13.7. Retention in the Regular Air Force:
   13.7.1. AFI 36-2008 (formerly AFR 45-26) provides guidance for officers to apply for retention on
   AD. Officers interested in remaining on AD should be advised only those possessing a critical AFSC
   will be seriously considered for retention.
   13.7.2. AFMPC/DPMM will process applications for medical officers.
   13.7.3. Chaplains desiring to remain on AD will forward applications to HQ USAF/HCS, Washing-
   ton DC 20332-5113. Chaplains selected would be contingent upon obtaining ecclesiastical endorse-
   ment from the appropriate agency.
66                                                                  AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994

     13.7.4. Line officers applying for retention on AD and enlisted members applying for enlistment in
     the REGAF will forward applications to AFMPC/PRC.
     13.7.5. Individuals selected will be directed to report to the nearest AD MPF for enlistment/AD pro-
     cessing.

13.8. Sanctuary for ANGUS/USAFR Personnel. ANGUS/USAFR members who attain sanctuary may
remain on AD. See paragraph 6.13 for further guidance.

13.9. Procedures for Reconstitution. Requirements for reconstitution efforts over and above the initial
30 days provided following ANGUS/USAFR member’s release back to the ANGUS/USAFR for deacti-
vation will be requested by the wing/group commander to the ANGRC/CSS or HQ AFRES/CAT to NGB/
XO or HQ USAF/REO to HQ USAF/CAT-XOX for final approval.

13.10. Retention on AD for Hardship Reasons. Individuals may request retention on AD due to per-
sonal, financial, or medical hardship caused by mobilization or early deactivation/demobilization. Other
circumstances that may prevent an individual from returning to civilian status may be considered. Mem-
bers with approved cases may be retained for a period up to but not to exceed the original activation
period. Hardship application process is as follows:
     13.10.1. MPF responsibilities:
        13.10.1.1. Conduct initial interview. Inform member of necessary documentation and explain
        hardship process to include statement that application package must be submitted at least 15 days
        before the established deactivation/demobilization date.
        13.10.1.2. Review packages for completeness (ensure all necessary supporting documentation is
        included).
        13.10.1.3. Request a Report Individual Person (RIP) in the Record Review Listing (RRL) format.
        13.10.1.4. Forward the application within 3-duty days as follows:
            13.10.1.4.1. ANGUS MPF forwards application through state headquarters to ANGRC/
            CSS-PRC who in turn forwards package to AFMPC/PRC.
            13.10.1.4.2. USAFR MPF forwards to AFMPC/PRC through HQ AFRES/DPX.
            13.10.1.4.3. IMA and PIM MPF forward to AFMPC/PRC through AD MAJCOMs.
        13.10.1.5. Update PDS.
        13.10.1.6. Provide a copy of final disposition to individual and appropriate unit commander
        within 2-duty days. A second copy will be filed in the member’s case file.
     13.10.2. Individual Responsibility. Standard format for request will include:
        13.10.2.1. Name, grade, social security number (SSN), AFSC, current assignment unit/location/
        organization, established deactivation date and requested deactivation date.
        13.10.2.2. Detailed explanation of hardship.
        13.10.2.3. Supporting documentation may include, but is not limited to, applicable statements by
        employers, financial institutions, creditors, doctors, university/school, Employer Support for
AFH10-416 22 DECEMBER 1994                                                                             67

     Guard and Reserve (ESGR) representatives, judge advocate, chaplain, or leave and earning state-
     ments.
     13.10.2.4. Member signs the application.
     13.10.2.5. Recommendation of unit commander will be included as endorsement to individual’s
     hardship extension request.
  13.10.3. Guidance for use in consideration of hardship cases. Suggested checklist:
     13.10.3.1. Hardship should be the result of mobilization or early deactivation/demobilization.
     However, other unforeseen circumstances may exist that could also be considered.
     13.10.3.2. Hardship request will not be based on problem(s) that existed prior to activation (i.e.,
     individuals who were unemployed when activated, cannot base their hardship application on "no
     job to go back to").
     13.10.3.3. Consider the length of time an individual is on, or will be on, AD before being deacti-
     vated (e.g., 35 days or a 12-month tour).
     13.10.3.4. Be receptive to the merits of each case with a view toward some point in the near future
