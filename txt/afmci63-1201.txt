1. LCSE including OSS&E
     1.1. Systems Engineering (SE): SE encompasses the entire set of scientific, technical, and
     managerial efforts needed to conceive, evolve requirements, develop, verify capabilities,
     deploy, support, sustain, and dispose of a robust product, platform, system, or integrated
     System-of-Systems/Family-of-Systems (SoS/FoS) capability to meet user needs. SE may be
     referred to as a discipline, a methodology, an approach, a practice, a process, a set of
     processes and sub-processes, or various other terms; however, its fundamental elements –
     systematic technical and managerial processes and measurements – remain the same
     regardless of the collective nomenclature. SE provides the integrating technical and
     managerial process to define and balance performance, cost, schedule, risk, supportability,
     and security for an item, system, and SoS/FoS throughout their life cycle. SE requires an
     interdisciplinary execution approach.
     1.2. LCSE: Tailored application of SE fundamentals must begin at concept inception and
     continue through and across life cycle phases (user needs identification through disposal).
     SE decisions can be made at any life cycle phase and will affect the cost, schedule and
     performance of the item, system, and SoS/FoS. Key decisions made early have significant
     impact through the life cycle.         LCSE emphasizes disciplined technical planning,
     organization, and execution of integrated SE efforts necessary to balance research,
     development, acquisition, T&E and sustainment organizations (including regeneration and
     disposal organizations) to ensure delivered products meet users’ expectations.
AFMCI63-1201 14 OCTOBER 2009                                                                  3


  1.3. OSS&E: The AF assigns OSS&E responsibilities to assure the operational safety,
  suitability, and effectiveness of systems, sub-systems, and end items throughout their
  operational life. OSS&E establishes and documents the system or end item configuration
  while Life Cycle Systems Engineering describes the processes needed to achieve and
  maintain the established configuration. The OSS&E configuration baseline for all fielded
  systems and end items shall be documented in the OSS&E Baseline Document (OBD). The
  OBD describes the collection of information that provides the essential characteristics and
  information that must be known to safely and effectively operate, upgrade, maintain and
  sustain a specific system or end item. Generally it references the location of other documents
  that support the OBD. A critical element of the OBD is the identification of OSS&E metrics
  that identify the key system characteristics and may be used to track OSS&E status. The
  Program Systems Engineering Plan (SEP) identifies the policy and guidance needed to
  address the systems engineering life cycle processes (Attachment 2) and technical data,
  including specifications and standards, for achieving and assuring preservation of baseline
  OSS&E characteristics of systems and end items. These processes and standards should be
  tailored to individual programs in the AF product lines (Aircraft, Weapons, Command &
  Control, Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance, and Space), as well as to Air Logistics
  Centers (ALCs) for maintenance and sustainment issues. Data management systems must be
  compatible with the Logistics Enterprise Architecture and the AF Acquisition Enterprise
  Architecture. Characteristics of an effective OSS&E approach are:
     1.3.1. Establish an OSS&E baseline including definition of characteristics necessary to
     ensure operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness.
     1.3.2. Delivery of systems, sub-systems, and end items with a baseline enabling OSS&E.
     1.3.3. Preservation of OSS&E baseline characteristics of systems, sub-systems, and end
     items over their operational life.
     1.3.4. Updating of OSS&E baselines when making modifications or changes to systems,
     sub-systems, or end items.
  1.4. Relationship between OSS&E and LCSE: LCSE decisions must enable a system, sub-
  system, or end item to remain operationally safe, suitable, and effective throughout its life
  cycle. The OSS&E approach and OBD are vital communication tools between acquisition
  and sustainment offices to ensure SE processes are addressing life cycle considerations. The
  OBD provides a current approved configuration, technical orders and safety assessments.
  1.5. OSS&E responsibility: The SPM has Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness
  (OSS&E) responsibility for a system, sub-system, or end item.           The Chief Engineer
  (CE)with Lead Engineer (LE) support is the SPM’s chief technical authority responsible for
  establishing, implementing, managing, and controlling SE activities necessary to develop and
  field robust products and systems that exhibit attributes of system security, OSS&E, and
  Mission Assurance. Per AFI 63-101, the SPM is the designated individual with the
  responsibility for and authority to accomplish program objectives for development,
  production, and sustainment to meet the user’s operational needs. SPMs and CEs for
  programs, systems, and end items in sustainment must continue rigorous application of SE
  principles. All relevant aspects of SE performance must be assessed with a focus on ensuring
  OSS&E of those systems.

       1.5.1. An SPM is the authority for ensuring OSS&E for a system, sub-system, or end
       item; Peculiar Support Equipment (PSE) required to sustain a system, sub-system, or end
       item; sub-systems and components that comprise a system or PSE; and integration of any
       government furnished equipment (GFE), payload, cargo, or other item that interfaces
       with a system, sub-system, or end item. The SPM can be located at either a Product
       Center or Logistics Center.
       1.5.2. The CE is a SPM’s chief technical authority for systems. The CE leads the
       implementation of a program’s SE processes and is accountable to the SPM for ensuring
       the integrity of those processes, including technical risk assessment focused on ensuring
       OSS&E of an assigned system. The CE is a System’s technical authority for all PSE,
       GFE, subsystems and components, and integration of any payload, cargo, or other item
       that interfaces with the system. The CE will provide a technical assessment to the SPM
       for commercial or government managed sub-systems and end items intended to be either
       temporarily or permanently installed on a system, interface with a system, or used to
       manufacture or maintain a system. Only one CE is assigned to a system, although one
       CE can support multiple systems.
       1.5.3. The LE is the delegated technical authority for sub-systems or end items, and
       provides technical support to CEs. A LE cannot assume technical accountability for
       system level assessments or certifications. Multiple LEs can provide technical support to
       a CE, and a LE can support multiple CEs. The LE must coordinate all subsystem or end
       item modifications with the CEs for the affected systems. The LE ensures sub-system or
       end item technical processes enable system level OSS&E.
       1.5.4. Delegation of OSS&E authority shall be clearly documented and consistent with
       the roles and responsibilities in this AFMCI. Specific OSS&E responsibilities shall be
       documented in writing and approved by the SPM/CE, as well as the delegated
       organization.
    1.6. SE Process Areas:
       1.6.1. An overview of the systems engineering life cycle process areas may be found in
       the latest versions of the Air Force Systems Engineering Assessment Model (AF SEAM)
       Management Guide, Defense Acquisition Guidebook and AFI 63-1201 (Life Cycle
       Systems Engineering). Refer to these documents for additional details and the latest
       information on systems engineering life cycle processes. Attachment 2 in AFMCI 63-
       1201 describes the minimum set of systems engineering processes that AFMC
       organizations should implement.

     1.6.2. Programs shall use AF SEAM as a self assessment tool to evaluate their
     organization’s capability to perform SE processes according to the following
     requirements. In the context of this section the terms project and program refer to all
     activities that develop requirements and convert them into capabilities or solutions.
        1.6.2.1. All AFMC Center organizations shall conduct annual AF SEAM self
        assessments according to the following criteria.
            1.6.2.1.1. If an organization has documented common systems engineering
            processes as required in AFMCI 63-1201 para 2.2.5 and all projects and programs
            within the organization use them, then the self assessment can be a combined
            assessment of a subset of the organization’s projects and programs. The combined
            assessment shall not be any higher than the Division or Group level. Common
            systems engineering process documentation may include operating instructions,
            supplements, and other documentation that cover the applicable AF SEAM
            systems engineering process areas. The specific projects or programs assessed
            during an organization’s combined self assessment shall be rotated on an annual
            basis as determined by the Director of Engineering (or equivalent) but will
            always include assessments of any ACAT I and special interest programs.
            1.6.2.1.2. If the organization does not have documented common systems
            engineering processes or programs or projects within the organization have a
            waiver to not use the organization’s common systems engineering processes, then
            all programs and projects within the organization must conduct an annual self
            assessment.
        1.6.2.2. Air Force Global Logistics Support Center (AFGLSC) organizations are
        required to accomplish tailored, independent, separate AF SEAM assessments. The
        assessments will cover appropriate AF SEAM practices that Lead Engineers within
        the AFGLSC are working in direct support of weapon system level organizations,
        through delegated and documented agreements. AFGLSC Lead Engineers are not
        required to perform duplicative assessments by weapon system.
            1.6.2.2.1. If the AFGLSC Center Level Technical Authority determines that an
            organization has documented common systems engineering processes and
            determines that all projects and programs use them, then the self assessment can
            be a combined assessment of a subset of the AFGLSC organization's projects and
            programs. The combined assessment shall not be any higher than the Squadron
            level.
            1.6.2.2.2. If the AFGLSC Center Level Technical Authority determines that the
            assessed organization does not have documented common systems engineering
            processes or has a waiver not to use the organization’s common systems
            engineering processes then all programs and projects within the organization must
            conduct an annual self assessment.

     1.7. Concept Development:
        1.7.1. All AFMC organizations that develop pre-program materiel concepts shall
        establish standard processes to translate needed operational capability into conceptual
        descriptions and/or technologies. These processes shall be documented in a concept
        development (CD) organizational operating instruction (OI). The Early Systems
        Engineering Guidebook by SAF/AQ should be used as a reference to construct a CD OI.
        CD OIs shall be updated and approved annually.
        1.7.2. All Air Force efforts (contracted or otherwise) to develop pre-program materiel
        concepts shall be governed by the CD OI.
        1.7.3. Concept technical baselines shall be documented in a manner consistent with the
        Early Systems Engineering Guidebook. The Concept Characterization and Technical
        Description (CCTD) from the Guidebook is the recommended template.
        1.7.4. For concepts developed by non-Air Force entities, the sponsoring AF organization
        shall ensure that concept developers provide documentation consistent with the CD OI.
     1.8. Program Guidelines: AFMC programs operating under the Department of Defense
     Instruction (DoDI) 5000.02 Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, or any other
     authority, shall follow the policy below regardless of the name of particular milestones,
     phases or technical reviews.

is based on the Air Force Systems Engineering Assessment Model (AF SEAM), the Defense
Acquisition Guidebook (DAG) with the associated Defense Acquisition Program Support
Methodology, and AFI 63-1201. Acquisition, modification and sustainment programs will need
to comply with AFI 63-1201 and be prepared for assessments based on the AF SEAM and
DAG/DAPS systems engineering frameworks. Refer to the latest versions of AF SEAM
Management Guide, Defense Acquisition Program Support (DAPS) Methodology Guide and
AFI 63-1201 for current information. The remainder of this attachment contains a description of
the AF SEAM process areas as of the release date of this instruction.
The table below describes the relationship between the three different systems engineering
frameworks.

 Decision Analysis               Decision Analysis                Decision Analysis

A2.2. Configuration Management.
   A2.2.1. The Configuration Management process is utilized to establish and maintain the
   integrity of the product’s technical baseline while accommodating change. A baseline is
   defined as a set of specifications engineering drawings, source code listings, or other work
   products that have been formally reviewed and agreed on, that thereafter serves as the basis
   for further development and authoritative representation of the product. An example of a
   baseline is an approved description of a product that includes internally consistent versions of
   requirements, requirement traceability matrices, designs, end-user and support
   documentation, etc.
   A2.2.2. A progression of technical baselines is developed during the development life cycle
   of a product. Baselines provide a stable basis for continuing evolution of configuration items,
   which are defined as aggregations of work products that are designated for configuration
   management and are treated as single entities within the configuration management process.
   Once the baseline is established, changes to the configuration items can only be done through
   a formal change process.
   A2.2.3. Minimum requirements:
      A2.2.3.1. Document the configuration management process
      A2.2.3.2. Establish a configuration control board
      A2.2.3.3. Identify the configuration items
      A2.2.3.4. Establish and maintain the technical baseline
      A2.2.3.5. Document changes to the configuration items
      A2.2.3.6. Perform configuration audits
   A2.2.4. Required artifacts:
      A2.2.4.1. Configuration Management Plan
      A2.2.4.2. Configuration Control Board Charter
      A2.2.4.3. List of configuration items
      A2.2.4.4. Baseline description (e.g., functional, allocated, product)
      A2.2.4.5. Change requests
      A2.2.4.6. Configuration audit results
A2.3. Decision Analysis.
   A2.3.1. The Decision Analysis process is used to consider possible decisions using a formal
   process that evaluates identified alternatives against established criteria. It is often a multi-
   disciplined activity requiring considerations of costs, schedules, risks, sustainment impacts,
   and other factors. A repeatable, criteria-based decision making process is especially
   important, both while making the critical decisions that define and guide the acquisition
   process itself and later when critical decisions are made with the selected suppliers. The

   establishment of a formal process for decision making provides the acquisition project with
   documentation of the decision rationale. Such documentation allows the criteria for critical
   decisions to be revisited when changes that impact project requirements or other critical
   project parameters change.
   A2.3.2. Minimum requirements:
      A2.3.2.1. Document the decision analysis methodology.
      A2.3.2.2. Determine when an issue needs to follow the formal evaluation process (e.g.,
      based on a cost threshold)
      A2.3.2.3. Identify alternative solutions that should be considered.
      A2.3.2.4. Evaluate the alternatives and document the decisions (e.g., evaluation criteria,
      rationale for selecting the alternative)
   A2.3.3. Required artifacts:
      A2.3.3.1. Decision analysis methodology
      A2.3.3.2. Criteria for evaluating alternatives
      A2.3.3.3. AoA/decision analysis report
A2.4. Design.
   A2.4.1. The Design process involves conceiving and proofing an integrated solution that
   satisfies product requirements. The Design process area focuses on product design, initial
   implementation, and integration. As each level of the product is defined, there is an iterative
   process of allocation, high-level design, and requirements definition (for the next lower
   level).
   A2.4.2. Product design consists of two broad phases that may overlap in execution:
   preliminary and detailed design. Preliminary design establishes product capabilities and the
   product architecture, including product partitions, product-component identifications, product
   states and modes, major inter-component interfaces, and external product interfaces. Detailed
   design fully defines the structure and capabilities of the product components. During detailed
   design, the product architecture details are finalized and product components and interfaces
   are completely defined.
   A2.4.3. Product integration is achieved through progressive assembly of product
   components, in one stage or in incremental stages, according to a defined integration
   sequence and procedures. A critical aspect of product integration is the management of
   interfaces to the products and between product components to ensure compatibility among
   the interfaces. Attention should be paid to interface management throughout the project.
   A2.4.4. Product integration can be conducted incrementally, using an iterative process of
   assembling product components, evaluating them, and then assembling larger collections of
   components. This process may begin with analysis and simulations (e.g., virtual and rapid
   prototypes). In a succession of builds, the simulated product is constructed, evaluated,
   improved, and reconstructed based upon knowledge gained in the evaluation process.
   A2.4.5. Minimum requirements:
AFMCI63-1201 14 OCTOBER 2009                                                                 31

      documents)
      A2.4.5.2. Develop initial designs for each component, end item, system, etc. based on
      identified requirements and constraints (consider purchasing COTS products as well as
      developing new ones)
      A2.4.5.3. Evaluate any design alternatives based on established selection criteria (use
      M&S and prototyping as required)
      A2.4.5.4. Develop detailed designs for components, end items, systems, etc.
      A2.4.5.5. Conduct technical reviews based on entrance and exit criteria
      A2.4.5.6. Prepare a technical data package
   A2.4.6. Required artifacts:
      A2.4.6.1. Design criteria (e.g., Key Performance Parameters (KPPs), interfaces, statutory
      requirements)
      A2.4.6.2. Design documents (e.g., DoDAF views, engineering drawings, use cases,
      interface control documents, Bill of Materials)
      A2.4.6.3. Documented baseline (e.g., functional, allocated)
      A2.4.6.4. Associated technical review (e.g., PDR, CDR) entrance and exit criteria
      A2.4.6.5. Trade studies/analyses
      A2.4.6.6. Technical data package
A2.5. Manufacturing.
   A2.5.1. The Manufacturing process is used to prepare for and produce the required product
   and includes the following: 1) application of industrial base and manufacturing process
   expertise and information to the Requirements and Design processes, 2) planning for and
   managing the manufacturing process maturation efforts needed for successful transition from
   product development to rate production, and 3) stabilizing a sustained rate production while
   assuring affordable quality products.
   A2.5.2. Clear manufacturing readiness criteria should exist for each phase of the project and
   be agreed to by relevant stakeholders. Manufacturing readiness assessments should be
   conducted to confirm manufacturing readiness at key points in the project. Manufacturing
   transition plans are established to address the manufacturing readiness criteria and executed
   to ensure maturation of manufacturing capability. The residuals of manufacturing (e.g.,
   facilities, processes, tooling, and test equipment) should be integrated into the support
   infrastructure required for the remainder of the product life cycle.
   A2.5.3. Minimum requirements:
      A2.5.3.1. Ensure strategic manufacturing planning and integration with design
      A2.5.3.2. Define critical manufacturing processes and key characteristics
      A2.5.3.3. Ensure readiness for transition to production
      A2.5.3.4. Establish and maintain a supplier management program

      A2.5.4.5. Quality Assurance Plan and deficiency reporting system
      A2.5.4.6. Metrics, root cause analyses, value stream maps
A2.6. Project Planning.
   A2.6.1. Project Planning is a multi-disciplined process used to establish and maintain plans
   that define project activities. Planning starts by aligning the technical activities with the
   acquisition strategy and is followed by planning technical activities in ever increasing levels
   of detail. The resulting plans should be reviewed for consistency with the overall acquisition
   plan. The acquirer’s and suppliers’ project planning processes are continuous, and the plans
   evolve to meet the project’s needs.
   A2.6.2. Project planning relates the acquisition’s technical objectives, constraints,
   availability of assets and technologies, accommodation of end user considerations,
   consideration of risk, and technical support for the project over the life cycle.
   A2.6.3. Minimum requirements:
      A2.6.3.1. Develop and document project/technical plans that consider the entire life
      cycle
      A2.6.3.2. Prepare a work breakdown structure to manage the project
      A2.6.3.3. Determine the scope of the project’s work products and tasks
      A2.6.3.4. Develop and update cost estimates and schedule

      A2.6.4.4. Funding documents and cost data
      A2.6.4.5. Entrance and exit criteria for technical reviews, milestones, key decision
      points, etc.
A2.7. Requirements.
   A2.7.1. The Requirements process is used to develop and analyze operational user, product,
   and product-component requirements to assure consistency between those requirements and
   the project’s technical plans and work products and to manage requirements evolution
   through the life cycle of the product.
   A2.7.2. The Requirements process has three contexts: 1) the amalgamation and coordination
   of the stakeholder requirements into a set of requirements that will define the scope and
   direction of the acquisition, 2) the logical analysis that discovers any natural partitioning
   manifested in the requirements, and 3) the extension of the customer requirements and
   additional acquirer requirements derived from design activities that occur as the product
   matures and evolves (e.g., product characteristics, architecture requirements, component
   design requirements).
   A2.7.3. Developing increasingly detailed derived requirements is a continuous, iterative
   process that occurs as the multiple layers of a complex product are defined. For example,
   requirements flow from the stakeholders to the product, segment, etc., and eventually to
   hardware or software component levels. The responsibility for developing requirements
   down through the levels is generally split between the acquirer and the suppliers. The
   acquirer is generally responsible for the higher levels, starting with operational requirements,
   and the suppliers are generally responsible for lower levels. The division of responsibilities
   between the acquirer and suppliers is determined for each project.
   A2.7.4. The acquirer is responsible for defining and baselining the requirements levels under
   its control and also monitoring the suppliers’ definition of the lower level requirements. The
   acquirer will provide direct management of acquirer-controlled requirements and oversight of
   suppliers’ requirements management. Requirements should be managed and maintained with
   discipline so that changes are not executed without recognizing the impact to the project.
   A2.7.5. Minimum requirements:
      A2.7.5.1. Document the requirements management process
      A2.7.5.2. Involve stakeholders when developing requirements
      A2.7.5.3. Identify and document compulsory (e.g., statutory, regulatory, KPPs,
      interfaces) and derived requirements
      A2.7.5.4. Prioritize the requirements
      A2.7.5.5. Document and manage the requirements (avoid requirements creep)
      A2.7.5.6. Ensure requirements have bidirectional traceability from the user need to the
      design solution
      A2.7.5.7. Refine, elaborate, and allocate requirements during the Design process
 34                                                     AFMCI63-1201 14 OCTOBER 2009


      A2.7.5.8. Analyze requirements throughout the product life cycle (e.g., to ensure they are
      necessary and sufficient, to balance stakeholder needs and constraints, to ensure the
      evolving product will perform as intended in the operational environment)
      A2.7.5.9. Identify and resolve inconsistencies between requirements, project plans, and
      work products
      A2.7.5.10. Conduct technical reviews (e.g., System Requirements Review) based on
      entrance and exit criteria
   A2.7.6. Required artifacts:
      A2.7.6.1. Requirements Management Plan
      A2.7.6.2. User requirements documents (e.g., Initial Capabilities Document, Capabilities
      Development Document, Concept of Operations)
      A2.7.6.3. System/Technical Requirements Document or Performance Specification
      A2.7.6.4. Requirements traceability matrix/requirements correlation matrix or table
      A2.7.6.5. Requirements/functional baseline/allocated baseline
      A2.7.6.6. Technical review documentation (e.g., entrance and exit criteria, meeting
      minutes, action items)
A2.8. Risk Management.
   A2.8.1. The Risk Management process is used to identify potential problems before they
   occur so risk handling activities may be planned and invoked as needed to handle adverse
   impacts on achieving objectives.
   A2.8.2. Risk identification and estimation of probability of occurrence and impact,
   particularly for those risks involved in meeting performance requirements, schedules, and
   cost targets, largely determine the acquisition strategy. The acquirer has a dual role: 1)
   assessing and managing technical risks for the duration of the project, and 2) assessing and
   managing technical risks associated with the performance of the supplier. As the acquisition
   progresses to the selection of a supplier, the risk specific to the supplier’s technical and
   management approach then becomes important to the success of the acquisition.
   A2.8.3. Minimum requirements:
      A2.8.3.1. Document the risk management approach (include risk sources and categories)
      A2.8.3.2. Identify and document risks
      A2.8.3.3. Assign a probability and consequence to each risk based on established criteria
      A2.8.3.4. Prioritize risks based on their probability and consequence
      A2.8.3.5. Aggregate interrelated risks
      A2.8.3.6. Develop an appropriate risk handling method (assume, control/mitigate, avoid,
      transfer)
      A2.8.3.7. Monitor and assess risk handling activities
   A2.8.4. Required artifacts:
AFMCI63-1201 14 OCTOBER 2009                                                                    35

      A2.8.4.4. Results of failure mode and effects analysis
A2.9. Transition, Fielding and Sustainment.
   A2.9.1. The Transition, Fielding and Sustainment process is used to prepare for and execute
   the support, maintenance, repair, and disposal of a product while ensuring it is safe, suitable,
   and effective. Sustainment is the planning, programming, and executing of a support strategy.
   It includes specific activities in all phases of a product life cycle from product concept
   formulation to disposal.
   A2.9.2. The overarching support concept should be considered from the start of any
   development or modification effort. Support concepts like condition based maintenance will
   drive requirements and design decisions. Early ALC representation in development of the
   support concept and related requirements is necessary to reduce total ownership costs.
   A2.9.3. Minimum requirements:
      A2.9.3.1. Identify/establish support activities
      A2.9.3.2. Plan for necessary resources
      A2.9.3.3. Plan for disposal
      A2.9.3.4. Plan for required funding
      A2.9.3.5. Establish list of qualified suppliers
   A2.9.4. Required artifacts:
      A2.9.4.1. Life Cycle Management Plan (or equivalent)
      A2.9.4.2. Transfer Support Plan
      A2.9.4.3. Technical orders
      A2.9.4.4. Training manuals
      A2.9.4.5. Technical data packages
A2.10. Technical Management and Control.
   A2.10.1. The Technical Management and Control process is utilized to provide an
   understanding of the project’s technical progress so that appropriate corrective actions can be
   taken when the project’s performance deviates significantly from the plan. Corrective actions
   may require replanning, which may include revising the original plan, establishing new
   agreements, or including additional mitigation activities in the current plan. If a corrective
   action is required to resolve variances from project plans, these actions should be defined and
   tracked to closure.
   A2.10.2. A project’s documented plan is the basis for monitoring activities, communicating
   status, and taking corrective action. Progress is primarily determined by comparing actual
   work product and task attributes, effort, cost, and schedule to the plan at prescribed
 36                                                       AFMCI63-1201 14 OCTOBER 2009


   milestones or control levels in the project schedule or WBS. Appropriate visibility of
   progress enables timely corrective action to be taken when performance deviates
   significantly from the plan. A deviation is significant if, when left unresolved, it precludes
   the project from meeting its objectives.
   A2.10.3. Monitoring and control functions are established early in the project as the
   project’s planning is performed and the acquisition strategy is defined. As the acquisition of
   technology solutions unfolds, monitoring and control activities are essential to ensure that
   appropriate resources are being applied and that acquirer activities are progressing according
   to plan.
   A2.10.4. Minimum requirements:
      A2.10.4.1. Document the approach to technical management and control
      A2.10.4.2. Establish integrated product teams (IPTs)
      A2.10.4.3. Develop a measurement approach (include measurement objectives and
      criteria)

      A2.10.4.5. Plan and conduct technical reviews
      A2.10.4.6. Manage work products and project data
      A2.10.4.7. Monitor and manage corrective actions to closure (use a deficiency reporting
      system as appropriate)
   A2.10.5. Required artifacts:
      A2.10.5.1. Technical planning documents (e.g., SEP, LCMP)
      A2.10.5.2. IPT charters
      A2.10.5.3. Project metrics
      A2.10.5.4. Status reports
      A2.10.5.5. Technical review meeting minutes
      A2.10.5.6. Corrective action plans/reports
A2.11. Verification and Validation.
   A2.11.1. The Verification process ensures that work products meet their specified
   requirements, whereas the Validation process demonstrates that a product or product
   component fulfills its intended use when placed in its intended environment.
   A2.11.2. It is important that the acquirer define at the outset the degree to which verification
   and validation are required both early in the definition of the project and later when the
   products are received. Test and analysis techniques should be implemented as early as
   possible to identify deficiencies that require corrective action to meet system requirements.
   A2.11.3. The acquirer should ensure that a proper verification environment exists, that it
   selects work products to evaluate based on documented criteria, and that the supplier uses
   appropriate methods to verify its work products. In this context, the test and evaluation
AFMCI63-1201 14 OCTOBER 2009                                                                     37


  community is a major stakeholder, and should participate in up-front planning through final
  product acceptance.
  A2.11.4. Product verification activities are routinely conducted throughout the entire
  contract performance period, and results are analyzed to determine acceptability of the
  products. Validation activities are normally performed early and continuously throughout the
  acquisition life cycle. Product validation activities can be applied to all aspects of the product
  in any of its intended environments, such as operation, training, manufacturing, maintenance,
  and support services.
  A2.11.5. Minimum requirements:
     A2.11.5.1. Form an Integrated Test Team (ITT)
     A2.11.5.2. Document an integrated approach for verification and validation (include

A5.1. This attachment provides a description of the process for the delegation of Class II ECP
and minor nonconformance disposition authority to DCMA for aviation CSIs. The attachment
also establishes that if another service has determined delegation of disposition authority is
appropriate, AFMC will accept the MRB disposition authority delegation decision unless proper
justification is provided for denying that authority. Proper justification may include existing
contractual requirement for CSI identification, schedule impact, cost effectiveness, and resource
availability. This guidance only applies to Class II ECP and minor nonconformances for
aviation CSIs.
