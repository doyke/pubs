                                     ATD SCHEDULING

1.1. Daily Training Program. Each base determines daily training period start and stop times,
but the total elapsed time cannot exceed the contract-established hours. Requested training time
that exceeds the daily contract hours must have administrative contracting officer approval
before the training begins. This training time is treated as additional effort, according to the
applicable contract. If daily utilization plan changes occur, provide those changes to the
contractor in sufficient time to permit the contractor to reschedule maintenance requirements,
console operations, and simulator instructors. When scheduling training missions outside the
published daily utilization plan but within the contract hours, notify the contractor at least 2
hours before the start of the added mission.
1.2. ATD Mission Lengths:
   1.2.1. S2C75 Unit Training Device (UTD) T-6A. Mission lengths usually vary from 1.0 to
   1.3 hours. This figure does not include scheduled turn time between missions.
   1.2.2. S2F188 Operational Flight Trainer (OFT) T-6A. Mission lengths are usually 1.3
   hours. This figure does not include scheduled turn time between missions.
   1.2.3. S2B48 Instrument Flight Trainer T-6A. Mission lengths are usually 1.3 hours. This
   figure does not include scheduled turn time between missions.
   1.2.4. T111 UTD T-38C. Missions usually vary from 1.0 to 1.3 depending upon syllabus
   directives. This does not included scheduled turn time between missions.
   1.2.5. T112 OFT T-38C. Missions are usually 1.3 in length, but could vary depending upon
   syllabus directives. This does not include scheduled turn time between missions.
   1.2.6. T114 Weapon System Trainer T-38C. Missions vary in length depending upon
   syllabus directives. Most missions vary from 1.0 to 1.3 hours. This figure does not include
   scheduled turn time between missions.
   1.2.7. T113 Part Task Trainer T-1A. Missions vary in length according to syllabus
   directives.
   1.2.8. T96 Trainer, Flight Simulator T-1A. T96 mission lengths vary according to
   syllabus directives. Schedule sorties in half-hour increments including 10 minutes turn time
   for ATD initialization, or contractor minor adjustments (i.e., for 2.6 hours syllabus time plus
   0.2 turn time, schedule a 3.0-hour block).
   1.2.9. T25 Simulator for Electronic Combat Training (Randolph AFB and Pensacola
   Naval Air Station Only). Mission lengths vary depending upon syllabus directives.
   1.2.10. T45 Undergraduate Navigator Training Simulator (Randolph AFB). Each
   mission is usually 4 hours long (occasionally there are 8-hour missions) with 1 hour
   separating each 4-hour mission.
1.3. Equipment Downtime. If equipment downtime for modifications and inspections will
affect ATD scheduling, the ATD work center (contractor site manager or alternate) completes
4                                                          AETCI11-401 18 DECEMBER 2009


and submits a schedule monthly, through the project officer (PO), to the operations group (OG)
or flying training squadron (FTS) programmers.
1.4. Weekly Scheduling. The OG consolidates flying training squadron requests for ATD/CI
support on AETC Form 777, ATD Weekly Utilization Plan (Attachment 2), or within the
Training Integrated Management System (TIMS) scheduling function. Scheduling by hours or
sorties is a local option. The OG ensures copies of the AETC Form 777 are delivered to the ATD
PO, quality assurance representative (QAR) or quality assurance evaluator (QAE), and the ATD
contractors by 1500 the Wednesday preceding the week being scheduled. This plan is the
primary document for planning simulator maintenance activities and contract instructors (CI).
Changes to the daily window or sorties/hours must be kept to a minimum.
1.5. Daily Scheduling:
    1.5.1. By 1200 hours daily, the ATD maintenance work center provides the ATD status to
    the OG or FTS programmer. The OG or FTS establishes the ATD schedule.
    1.5.2. The OG or FTS programmer prepares AETC Form 513, ATD Daily Utilization Plan
    (Attachment 3), using the status and tail numbers (T45 simulator may use the weekly
    schedule). Identify sorties by type mission (training or orientation), if known, or flight
    assignment; start time; and completion time. Consider mission length (see paragraph 1.2)
    when selecting aircrew training stations (ATS) by tail number for subsequent scheduled
    flights. Also consider equal use of all ATDs. The schedule is prepared for the entire day.
    1.5.3. Provide a copy of the completed schedule to the ATD maintenance work center, and
    ATD operations work center or operations dispatcher no later than 1700 hours the day before
    the schedule day.
    1.5.4. Automated scheduling may be used if it complies with the intent of AETC Form 513.
    The daily plan may show a whole day schedule or half-day periods on separate forms, as
    determined by the wing.
    1.5.5. The ATD contractor must coordinate with OG or FTS programmers, PO, QAR, and
    QAE before committing an ATS to maintenance. At least an hour notice is required before
    scheduling an ATS committed to maintenance for operational use.
1.6. Daily Schedule Changes:
    1.6.1. Daily schedule additions that exceed weekly schedule sorties/hours must be
    coordinated with the ATD maintenance and operations workcenters before adding them to
    the AETC Form 513 or equivalent.
    1.6.2. Daily schedule sortie deletes/cancels, for sorties that do not require CI support, can be
    made up to the scheduled start time. Sorties that do require CI support must be cancelled no
    later than the syllabus required brief time. Sorties that are not cancelled according to this
    guidance will be reported as no shows.

Deviation—Any schedule change that occurs after the daily schedule is published (no later than
1700 on the previous day). Deviations include cockpit or tail number change to the printed
schedule; operations, maintenance, weather, or other add; ground abort, maintenance
cancellation, weather cancellation, or other cancellation.
Maintenance/Contractor Cancel—Missions canceled due to maintenance problems or lack of
contractor support.
No Shows—Crew fails to show or shows with insufficient time to complete the mission. Crew or
students have a 15-minute grace time after the mission start time to sign in. If they miss that
window, the mission is considered a no show. If a crew or student signs in after the 15-minute
deadline, the can take credit only for the time the simulator is actually used. The unused time is
considered no show time. The crew or student may use the maintenance allocated turn time to
successfully complete a mission if maintenance does not require the time. In all instances, the
crew or student cannot extend the mission past the start of the next training period.
Operations Adds (Ops Adds)—Sorties added to the published schedule by operations after
coordination with ATD maintenance and operations workcenters (see deviation).
Operations Cancel (Ops Can)—Sorties canceled or deleted from the published schedule by
operations (see deviation).
Simulator for Electronic Combat Training—Simulator used by the 563rd FTS to train
electronic warfare officers. It has been updated and is software configurable, and has been
adapted for use in the combat systems officer (CSO) training program.
