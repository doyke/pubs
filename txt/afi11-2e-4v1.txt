from the last E-4 RAP tasking message dated 1 Oct ’12. Other revisions include the addition of
tiered waiver levels to clarify waiver authority IAW the guidance prescribed in AFI 33-360.
Waiver authority guidelines in section 1.12 were updated to comply with latest MAJCOM
guidance. Minimum required hours for navigator selection for the E-4 has been reduced to 1500
hours to allow a larger pool of candidates. Changed RTRB requirement to Annual to reflect
guidance in parent Air Force Instruction. Added requirement for previous TTB receiver A/R
experience for flight engineer candidates. Added new guidance in section 1.9 for the handling of
student training and certification records. Deleted day landing requirement due to redundancy.
Deleted PAR requirement. Deleted the SASS position as that system is no longer used. Added
note in Table 2.1 to not delay initial qual evaluation due to lack of TWA activity. Added
paragraph 4.2.5 regarding documentation of ground training. Changed sortie requirements in
Table 4.7 and Table 4.13 to comply with minimum sortie requirements in AFI 11-202 Volume 1
for X-prefix coded flyers. Added note in Table 4.3 to allow 100% of Min Run landings to be
logged in the simulator but are not limited to simulator only accomplishment. Added paragraph
4.4.3 allowing instructors to credit 50% of training requirements while instructing. Increased
required number of Pilot Proficiency Exercises (ME30) to better represent training proficiency
for pilots. Added simulated 3-engine landing to list of events needed for Pilot RAP Sortie.

   1.2.3. HQ ACC/A3 will:
      1.2.3.1. Process recommendation for change.
      1.2.3.2. Address time sensitive changes by immediate action message.
1.3. Minimum Requirements for Assignment to Perform E-4 Crew Duties:
   1.3.1. Pilots (P) will be currently qualified in Tanker/Transport/Bomber (TTB) aircraft or a
   previously qualified pilot in the E-4, have 2,500 hours total time and 1,500 hours TTB
   aircraft time with current or previous TTB receiver air refueling experience, and be able to
   obtain a Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (TS/SCI) clearance. (T-3)
   1.3.2. Navigators (N) will be currently qualified in TTB aircraft or a previously qualified
   navigator in the E-4, have 1500 hours of total time and 1,000 hours in TTB aircraft with
   previous air refueling experience (tanker or receiver), and be able to obtain a TS/SCI
   clearance. (T-3)
   1.3.3. Flight engineers (FE) will be currently qualified instructors or a previously qualified
   FE in the E-4, with 2,500 hours FE time with previous TTB receiver air refueling experience,
   have 36 months retainability upon completion of Mission Qualification Training (MQT) and
   be able to obtain a TS/SCI clearance. (T-3)
   1.3.4. Flight Attendants (FA) must be grades E-4 through E-8 and have 36 months
   retainability upon completion of MQT and be eligible for a TS/SCI clearance. (T-3)
   1.3.5. Airborne Missions Systems Specialists (AMSS) must satisfy the requirements of AFI
   36-2110, Assignments. (T-3)
   1.3.6. Super High Frequency (SHF) Technicians must be a 5-level, pass a Class-3 flight
   physical, complete physiological training and obtain a TS/SCI clearance prior to departing
   their previous duty station.(T-3)
   1.3.7. Communications Control Officers (CCO) must be grade O-2 through O-4, able to pass
   a Class-3 flight physical, complete physiological training and obtain a TS/SCI clearance prior
   to departing their previous duty station.(T-3)
1.4. Training. Training is designed to progress the crewmember from Initial Qualification
Training (IQT) or Transition/Requalification Training (TX), through Mission Qualification
Training (MQT) and finally to Continuation Training (CT).
   1.4.1. IQT qualifies crewmembers in a basic crew position and flying duty without regard to
   the unit's mission.     The 338 CTS qualifies AMSS crewmembers as Basic Aircraft
   Qualification (BAQ).
   1.4.2. MQT qualifies a crewmember in the E-4 mission. For AMSS crewmembers the E-4
   training FTU program completes IQT for each crewmember. The unit training office enrolls
   crewmembers in an MQT program which trains the crewmember on mission specific and
   local area procedures.
   1.4.3. CT allows crewmembers to maintain combat capability, increase proficiency, and
   consists of mission-related training. CT crewmembers are designated BMC or CMR.
   1.4.4. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) is a CT program designed to focus training on
   capabilities needed to accomplish the E-4 mission.
AFI11-2E-4V1 16 OCTOBER 2014                                                                11


     1.4.4.1. CMR defines an aircrew member who has satisfactorily completed initial and
     mission qualification in the unit’s primary mission. Pilots, Navigators, Flight Engineers
     and Flight Attendants are initially qualified to CMR status. AMSS crewmembers must
     complete in-unit MQT to become CMR. CMR crewmembers maintain proficiency and
     qualification in the E-4 mission. Failure to complete CMR required training results in
     designation as Non-CMR (N-CMR). (T-3)
     1.4.4.2. BMC positions in the 1 ACCS/338 CTS are filled by highly experienced
     crewmembers whose primary job is squadron/group/wing/NAF/MAJCOM staff in
     support of flying operations. These crewmembers provide additional sortie generation
     capability, either in lieu of or in addition to CMR personnel. BMC crewmembers,
     because of their high experience and proficiency level, have a reduced training level
     requirement compared to CMR personnel. BMC crewmembers will accomplish all
     ground training designated by the squadron commander. Failure to complete BMC
     required training results in regression to Non-BMC (N-BMC) status. (T-3)
     1.4.4.3. N-CMR/N-BMC. Crewmembers designated N-CMR/N-BMC are not combat
     ready and must accomplish a tailored training plan to regain CMR/BMC. Crewmembers
     are designated N-CMR/N-BMC for failure to meet ground training, annual flight training,
     or sortie lookback requirements IAW Table 1.1 (T-3)
        1.4.4.3.1. While N-CMR/N-BMC, aircrew may still perform flying duties (including
        exercises and contingencies) in which they are current, qualified, and either familiar
        or proficient. Lack of currency in a particular CMR event does not prohibit N-CMR
        aircrew members from performing other flying events or SOF duties.
     1.4.4.4. Unqualified (UQ). Unqualified crewmembers require training and a flight
     evaluation to reach the next qualification level. Crewmembers may be designated UQ for
     the following reasons:
        1.4.4.4.1. Enrolled in Initial Qualification Training (IQT) or Requalification Training
        (RQT).
        1.4.4.4.2. Non-Current IAW AFI 11-202V1.
        1.4.4.4.3. Demonstrated lack of ability.
        1.4.4.4.4. Downgraded for failure to meet standards during a flight evaluation.
     1.4.4.5. Aircrew Experience Level. There are two experience levels for CT
     crewmembers: Inexperienced and Experienced.
        1.4.4.5.1. Experienced pilots should have 200 hours E-4 time.
        1.4.4.5.2. Experienced navigators should have 200 hours E-4 time.
        1.4.4.5.3. Experienced flight engineers should have 400 hours E-4 time.
        1.4.4.5.4. Experienced Flight Attendants should have 100 hours E-4 time.
        1.4.4.5.5. Experienced CCOs, AMSS crewmembers, and SHF technicians should
        have 10 normal alert tours or HHQ missions on the E-4.
     1.4.4.6. Experience Level Progression. The commander designates crewmembers
     experienced based on progression guidelines and demonstrated proficiency. (T-3)
 12                                                       AFI11-2E-4V1 16 OCTOBER 2014


          1.4.4.6.1. Experienced pilots should have 200 hours E-4 time.
          1.4.4.6.2. Experienced navigators should have 200 hours E-4 time.
          1.4.4.6.3. Experienced flight engineers should have 400 hours E-4 time.
          1.4.4.6.4. Experienced Flight Attendants should have 100 hours E-4 time.
          1.4.4.6.5. Experienced CCOs, AMSS crewmembers, and SHF technicians should
          have 10 normal alert tours or HHQ missions on the E-4.
      1.4.4.7. Instructor/Evaluator Qualified. Instructors/evaluators who become N-CMR/N-
      BMC may be allowed to continue academic and/or ATD instructor/evaluator duties.
1.5. Training Concepts and Policies:
   1.5.1. The unit will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat
   readiness consistent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the
   need for realism against the expected threat, crewmember capabilities, and safety. This
   instruction provides training guidelines and policies to be used with operational procedures
   specified in applicable flight publications. (T-3)
   1.5.2. ACC Training Support Squadron (HQ ACC/TRSS) will develop and validate training
   programs when tasked by HQ ACC/A3. (T-2)
   1.5.3. Design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron-tasked roles,
   maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety.     RAP training
   missions should emphasize scenarios that reflect operations based on employment plans,
   location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities. (T-3)
   1.5.4. In-flight Supervision:
      1.5.4.1. An instructor must supervise the following personnel when performing aircrew
      duties:
          1.5.4.1.1. Non-current aircrew members while performing event(s) to regain
          currency. (T-1)
          1.5.4.1.2. All aircrew members in initial, upgrade or requalification flying training.
          (T-1)
          1.5.4.1.3. Unqualified crewmembers and senior officers as defined in AFI 11-202V1,
          and any other staff personnel the WG, OG or SQ/CC designates as required to fly
          with an instructor. (T-1)
          1.5.4.1.4. For unqualified, non-current or senior officer pilots, the instructor pilot
          must be at a set of controls during critical phases of flight, or when an individual is
          regaining currency or qualification in specific events. Note: Critical phases of flight
          are defined as: takeoff, air refueling, approaches, and landing. Air refueling
          rendezvous/closures to pre-contact are not considered critical phases of flight. (T-1)
   1.5.5. Training Event Tables. Assign crewmember training tables according to their
   experience designation and RAP level. (T-3)
   1.5.6. When experience designation or RAP level changes, prorate new training
   requirements from the date of certification. (T-3)
AFI11-2E-4V1 16 OCTOBER 2014                                                                  13


1.6. Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management.
   1.6.1. The primary means of assessing crewmember RAP qualification is the monthly RAP
   sortie requirement. The breakout of sortie/mission types is provided as a guideline to be
   closely followed, but minor variations are expected. Shortfalls in the monthly sortie
   requirement are the basis for regression. The squadron commander determines mission
   qualification after considering ACC guidance and the individual’s capabilities.
   1.6.2. An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or a
   building block type sortie. (T-3)
   1.6.3. The squadron commander's first priority should be to train all designated
   crewmembers to CMR.
   1.6.4. Progression from BAQ to CMR requires: (T-3)
      1.6.4.1. One month of continuation training meeting the CMR sortie rate.
      1.6.4.2. Confirmation that the progressed crewmember can complete the prorated
      number of event requirements to remain CMR at the end of the training cycle.
      1.6.4.3. Completion of mission-related ground training.
      1.6.4.4. Squadron Commander Certification.
   1.6.5. One and Three-month Lookback. Table 1.1 defines the monthly sortie requirement for
   a crewmember to remain mission ready. If a crewmember fails to accomplish the monthly
   sortie requirement, review sortie accomplishment over the last three months. Failure to
   achieve the three-month sortie requirement may result in designation as N-BMC or N-CMR.
   Reference paragraph 4.5 Failure to Complete Training Requirements.                 If the
   crewmember does not have three months since becoming E-4 qualified, the monthly
   requirement must be satisfied. (T-3)
1.7. RAP Sortie Program Development.
   1.7.1. RAP sortie and event requirements apply to all crewmembers qualified to BMC/CMR.
   RAP Monthly Sortie Requirements are listed in Table 1.1, and are defined under the
   appropriate crew position in Attachment 2.

       1.8.2.3. Training period review. Instructors will review training folders prior to each
       training event (flight or ground) in order to develop a training plan. After each period,
       instructors will document training in sufficient detail to accurately assess student
       performance and make recommendations for subsequent training NLT than the next duty
       day. At the satisfactory completion of all required training, the instructor will make a
       recommendation for an in-flight evaluation. Students will review and initial training
       records after each training period.
       1.8.2.4. Maintain aircrew training folders for one year following completion of training
       or upon completion of a subsequent upgrade program. For example, a crewmember
       successfully completes IQT/MQT, and then 6 months later the crewmember successfully
       completes instructor upgrade. At this time, his or her IQT/MQT training documents will
       be purged (IAW AFRIMS RDS T 36 - 44 R 05.00, Aircrew Instruction Records, Flying
       Training Reports).
   1.8.3. History of Training:
       1.8.3.1. Documentation Procedures. The flight evaluation folder (FEF) maintains basic
       source documents to provide a current history of each individual's flying qualification in
       accordance with AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, and
       appropriate MAJCOM Supplement. Under the AF Forms 942, Record of Evaluation, in
       section 1 of the FEF, all other certifications (Alert A/C, SIOP, TC1/2, RM1/2 etc.) will be
       tracked on the Letter of Certifications (LOX), IAW 11-202 V2. Use AF Forms 1381,
       USAF Certification of Aircrew Training or MFR to identify those who have completed
       certification training.
       1.8.3.2. Letters of Qualification/Certification not recorded on the AF 942 (Alert A/C,
       SIOP, etc.). Destroy when entries have been transcribed to permanent records i.e.
       HARMS, ePEX, 1 ACCS/DOV letter of X’s, FEF on AF Forms 942, or AF 1381 (if
       used) IAW AFRIMS RDS T 36 – 44 R 06.00, Aircrew Qualification Certificates and
       Training Information.
   1.8.4. Training Reports. Prepare and forward training reports IAW MAJCOM directives.
       1.8.4.1. ARMS will maintain flying and ground training records IAW AFI 11-401,
       Aviation Management. Use ARMS forms prescribed in AFI 11-202V1, to document
       training in ARMS. (T-3)
1.9. Aircrew Utilization Policy:
   1.9.1. Commanders will ensure crewmembers (API-1/2/6s) fill authorized positions IAW
   Unit Manning Documents (UMD) and that crewmember status is properly designated. The
   overall objective is that crewmembers perform combat-related duties. Supervisors may
   assign crewmembers to perform other duties but must continually weigh the factors involved,
   such as level of crewmember tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience.
   Supervisors will limit the non-flying duties to those related to combat activities for
   inexperienced crewmembers in the first year of their initial operational assignment or those
   who have not completed their 5-level upgrade career development course. When personnel

   shortages occur, priority must be given to line unit-manning positions. Aircrew will not
   perform long-term duties that detract from their primary duties of training for or performing
   the unit’s flying mission. (T-3).
   1.9.2. API-6/8 rated personnel flying authorizations and Test Unit aircrews will be IAW AFI
   11-401 and MAJCOM guidance. They will fly the BMC sortie rate; however they are not
   required to complete BMC specific missions/events or meet lookback requirements. Units
   should provide assigned API-6/8 flyers adequate resources to maintain minimum training
   requirements. However, API-6/8 flyer support will not come at the expense of the flying
   squadron's primary mission. API-6/8 flyers will accomplish non-RAP requirements with
   allotted BMC sorties. If attached units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they must
   request relief IAW AFI 11-401, ACC Sup. Units requiring flying hour adjustments for
   attached API-8 and applicable API-6 flyers must request program changes IAW AFI 11-102,
   Flying Hour Program Management and associated MAJCOM supplement. (T-3).
   1.9.3. Aircrew in DNIF status will continue to complete and log all required ground training
   events, including simulator and aircraft generation, and those activities authorized by the
   flight surgeon and documented on the member’s AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation
   for Flying or Special Operational Duty. (T-3).
1.10. Sortie Utilization and Allocation Guidance:
   1.10.1. Inexperienced crewmembers should receive sortie allocation priority over
   experienced crewmembers. Priority for training sortie allocation is IQT/MQT, CMR and
   BMC.
   1.10.2. Maximizing the utilization and effectiveness of training resources is critical to
   producing CMR aircrew. The training plan for each sortie (airborne, ground or alert) will be
   thoroughly planned, and debriefed. (T-3)
1.11. Waiver Authority:
   1.11.1. HQ ACC/A3 designates the syllabus waiver authority within the respective formal
   course syllabus. The OG/CC is the approval authority for all syllabus deviations. A
   permanent copy of all waivers and syllabus deviations will be maintained in the individual’s
   training folder. (T-3)
   1.11.2. Unless specifically noted otherwise, the OG/CC is the waiver authority for all
   continuation and specialized training. Send a courtesy copy of all OG/CC approved waivers
   to HQ ACC/A3CN and an informal copy to the NAF/A3. A permanent record of all
   approved waivers will be maintained in the individual’s training folder. (T-3)
   1.11.3. HQ ACC/A3C is the waiver authority for all other provisions in this AFI unless
   specifically noted via the tiered waiver notation at the end of certain paragraphs. Consult
   AFI 33-360 for explanation of tiered waiver notations. Waiver requests will be in electronic
   form and will include the rationale for the waiver to HQ ACC/A3C. (T-2)
   1.11.4. HQ ACC/A3 is the waiver authority for Senior Staff Pilot Qualification Training
   (SSPQT).
   1.11.5. Waivers will be submitted and approved prior to the crewmember arriving for formal
   training or before training is completed as appropriate. (T-3)

                                           Chapter 2

                      INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING (IQT)

2.1. Scope. This chapter contains prerequisites and minimum training requirements necessary to
prepare prospective crewmembers to perform duties in the E-4 aircraft. Pilots, Navigators, Flight
Engineers and Flight Attendants combine IQT and MQT into one course of study. AMSS IQT
will be conducted utilizing syllabus courses at the Formal Training Unit (FTU). In exceptional
circumstances, when FTU training is not available, AMSS IQT may be conducted in-unit IAW
provisions of this chapter. This local IQT will be conducted using appropriate formal USAF
Qualification Training Course syllabus tracks, flow programs, and requirements. AMSS local
MQT programs supplement FTU training and are intended to qualify aircrew in new equipment,
missions, and capabilities unique to the unit. Units will utilize MAJCOM-approved local MQT
syllabi to address each training program. During AMSS local MQT, direct instructor supervision
is only required for items not previously evaluated at FTU. (T-2)
2.2. Time Period to Qualify:
   2.2.1. Personnel will commence training no later than 45 days after date assigned to the 1
   ACCS or 338 CTS and will complete training IAW the appropriate syllabus. Time limitations
   specified in Table 2.2, begin on the first day of entry into a training program. For AMSS
   crewmembers, treat each additional qualification as an initial qualification and apply the
   applicable syllabus and time limitations as specified in Table 2.2. (T-2)
   2.2.2. Extension of Time Limits.      If training is not possible due to extenuating
   circumstances, (emergency leave, DNIF, limited aircraft) the time limits may be extended by
   the number of days resources were not available or the member was not available for
   training. Provide as much training as possible to students who are DNIF or are in casual
   status.
   2.2.3. Upon entry into any formal qualification or in-unit upgrade program crewmembers
   will not normally be granted ordinary leave, permissive TDY nor utilized for missions/TDYs
   that are not part of their training plan. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the
   appropriate squadron commander. Training interruptions for any reason must be fully
   documented in the individual’s training folder. (T-3)
2.3. AMSS Aircrew Development. For first-term AMSS aircrew, the priority should be two-
seat qualification and then instructor upgrade. After this and if resources allow it, additional
upgrades may be considered. Attachment 4 shows the ideal training plan for long-term
sustainment. This plan is only a guide and the squadron Training Review Panel is authorized to
deviate from it when conditions warrant.
2.4. Prerequisites/Ground Training.
   2.4.1. For students initially assigned directly to the 338 CTS, the registrar will consult with
   the 1 ACCS prior to assigning students to a specific class. The student’s prior experience,
   previous training and unit needs are considered in determining the specific training a student
   will receive. (T-3)
AFI11-2E-4V1 16 OCTOBER 2014                                                                   19


   2.4.2. All Category I requirements in Table 4.1 except for Operations Plan Study and
   mission qualification should be completed prior to entering the IQT academic phase, but will
   be completed prior to entering the flying phase. (T-3)
   2.4.3. All E-4 aircrew members are required to have a government issued passport. Passport
   applications will be submitted to the 1 ACCS Flight Attendant office no later than 30 days
   after being assigned to the 338 CTS or the 1 ACCS. (T-3)
2.5. Qualification Training Requirements: (T-3)
   2.5.1. Pilots and flight engineers complete an FAA-approved commercial training course for
   Boeing 747 aircraft, followed by in-unit IQT IAW the syllabus as specified in Table 2.1
   2.5.2. The FAA-approved commercial training course consists of Aircraft General Systems,
   Normal Procedures, Abnormal/Emergency Procedures, and Flight Simulators. The flight
   simulators will allow pilots equal time in each seat, with the flight engineer performing panel
   operation half of the time and observing the other half. The training is complete upon
   satisfactory completion of an FAA simulator evaluation.
   2.5.3. Navigators receive IQT in-unit in accordance with the syllabus as specified in Table
   2.1
   2.5.4. Flight Attendants complete an FAA-approved commercial training course for
   passenger-type aircraft followed by in-unit IQT IAW the syllabus as specified in Table 2.1
   2.5.5. Airborne Mission Systems Specialists and SHF Technicians receive IQT in the 338
   CTS, or RQT in the 1 ACCS IAW the appropriate syllabus. For subsequent qualifications,
   i.e. position upgrades, students should return to the 338 CTS for training or the OG/CC may
   approve in-unit training.
       2.5.5.1. Only those AMSS instructors/evaluators who have completed the 338 CTS
       Faculty Training Course (FTC) may conduct IQT. Waiver authority is the 338 CTS/CC.
       Limit this guidance to AMSS instructors only since all other crew positions conduct IQT
       in the 1 ACCS. FTC training is not applicable for pilots, engineers, navigators and flight
       attendants. Requirements for in-flight supervision are already addressed in Ch. 1;
       requirements for the formal course are addressed in Ch. 5.
   2.5.6. Communications Control Officers receive IQT in-unit IAW the syllabus.
   2.5.7. Academic training should be completed prior to flight training and will be
   accomplished in accordance with the appropriate syllabus and the training requirements of
   Table 2.1
   2.5.8. An instructor of like specialty will recommend individuals for evaluation. The
   individual’s primary instructor will review the training records prior to the evaluation to
   ensure all appropriate training has been completed and documented.
2.6. Requalification. All individuals re-qualifying in the E-4 will accomplish the training as
prescribed below, under the time constraints of Table 2.2 Pilots and flight engineers will also
accomplish a Flight Simulator Continuation Training Block with an instructor pilot. (T-3)

   end of any active flying assignment to 8 Years. Complete the appropriate formal school
   RQT either at the 338 CTS or the 1 ACCS and complete a flight evaluation. (T-2)
   2.6.3. Unqualified for over 8 Years. Complete the appropriate formal school IQT at the 1
   ACCS or 338 CTS if available and a flight evaluation. (T-2)
2.7. Mission Qualification Training (P/N/FE/FA). Training listed in Table 2.1, must be
completed by a crewmember before the squadron commander can declare the individual CMR.
(T-3)
2.8. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements. All instructors and evaluators must
be graduates of a formal instructor course in order to conduct flight training and evaluation. Only
those instructors/evaluators who have completed the 338 CTS Faculty Training Course (FTC)
may conduct I/MQT, FTC and SSQT qualification training. Waiver authority is the 338
CTS/CC. (T-3)
2.9. Alert Participation. Normally, only current and qualified BMC/CMR crewmembers
should be placed on alert. 1 ACCS/DO may authorize non-current crewmembers to assume alert
duties if accompanied by an instructor. Unqualified crewmembers with proper clearance may be
attached to the alert crew for training purposes but are not considered part of the alert team.
Individuals declared BMC/CMR but subsequently delinquent in Instructor/Evaluator Duties or
Touch & Go Landings may still be placed on alert.
2.10. Table Definitions. Use the following definitions for all training event tables throughout
this volume: 1 – the event must be accomplished at least one time during training; AR – As

completion of the unit’s assigned mission. (T-3)
   4.2.1. Ground training is intended to be accomplished at regular intervals, which are
   contained in Table 4.1 The following symbols will be used to establish the regular frequency
   of training.
       4.2.1.1. A - Annual. Accomplished every 12 months. Each accomplishment establishes a
       new currency due date exactly one year after date of completion.
       4.2.1.2. AR - As Required. As required by governing instructions.
       4.2.1.3. B - Biennial. Accomplished every 24 months. Each accomplishment establishes

       from the month last accomplished.
       4.2.1.9. T - Triennial. Accomplished every 36 Months. Each accomplishment
       establishes a new currency due date 3 years after the date of completion.
   4.2.2. An individual who instructs a class receives credit for that ground training
   requirement.
   4.2.3. Ground training accomplished during any phase of qualification training may be
   credited toward continuation training requirements for the training cycle in which it was
   accomplished.
   4.2.4. Crewmembers that lose CMR/BMC status because of overdue ground training will
   regain CMR/BMC status upon completion of training.
   4.2.5. Completion of ground training will be documented using the AF IMT 1522 or 1
   ACCS MAR until permanently recorded in PEX, HARMS, MilPDS, TBA, AFTR and the
 26                                                       AFI11-2E-4V1 16 OCTOBER 2014


   DOV Letter of Certifications. CEA’s are exempt from maintaining OJT Training Folders (AF
   Form 623/623a, Individual Training Record Folder/On-the-Job Training Record
   Continuation Sheet, IAW CFETP). No other record of ground training is required.
4.3. Flying Training. All aircrew will accomplish the events shown in their respective
Continuation Training (CT) Tables (Table 4.3 - Table 4.13) within the 12-month period
beginning 1 October. (T-3)
   4.3.1. Flight training accomplished during IQT/MQT is not creditable to CT requirements.
   The dates that events were accomplished during IQT/MQT can be used to establish currency
   dates.
   4.3.2. The CT period is based on the 12-month fiscal year cycle. The fiscal year begins on 1
   October and ends on 30 September.
   4.3.3. Instructors and flight examiners may credit 50% of their total training requirements
   while instructing or evaluating. Exception: Instructor and Flight Examiner pilots may not
   credit any takeoffs, landings, or air refueling flown by another pilot.
4.4. Proration of Training:
   4.4.1. Training requirements for crewmembers that are not available for duties as outlined in
   AFI 11-202V1 will be prorated. (T-3)
   4.4.2. Enter the number of months a crewmember is unavailable into the ARMS to prorate
   remaining training. ARMS prorates the annual event table using the following formula:
       4.4.2.1. Events remaining = Annual Events X (# months available/12), truncated to the
       nearest whole number.
   4.4.3. Crewmembers completing MQT and receiving CMR certification during a given
   month start continuation training on the first day of the following month. Training
   accomplished during IQT/MQT is not counted toward CT requirements remaining after
   attaining CMR status. Initial currency dates for recurring training events are established by
   the date of the AFI 11-202V2 evaluation. For events not accomplished on the initial
   evaluation (such as night landings) the initial currency date is established by the date the
   event was last accomplished and graded proficient. All requirements for crewmembers
   departing PCS or separating will be prorated to the last day of the month preceding the month
   of departure. Refer to AFI 11-202V1, for further guidance. (T-3)
   4.4.4. Flying and academic training requirements for crewmembers that are not available for
   normal duties will be prorated according to Table 4.2 (T-3)
4.5. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Individuals who fail to complete
BMC/CMR ground requirements listed in Table 4.1, flight requirements listed in Tables 4.3
,4.13, or One and Three-Month Lookback requirements listed in Table 1.1, may be designated
N-BMC/N-CMR and will have their recent training history reviewed by the squadron
commander. The squadron commander will determine what training is necessary for the
crewmember to regain BMC/CMR status. This make-up training is creditable towards the new
training period. If this review indicates a proportionate/realistic volume of the BMC/CMR events
were recently accomplished that would ensure combat proficiency, the squadron commander
may declare the individual BMC/CMR. (T-3)

 NOTES:
 1. CRM is not grounding during initial qualification training. OG/CC is the waiver authority
    for this event.
 2. Grounding item when performing duties as a primary crewmember (not grounding if
    under instructor supervision)
 3. Grounding item for performing alert duties (not grounding for other missions).
 4. After 20 years of aviation service, academic refresher only
 5. This event is required as part of evaluation criteria IAW AFI 11-202V2. Currency for
    the event is tracked on the AF Form 8. Record of Evaluations is tracked using AF Form 942,
    Record of Evaluation.
 6. Must be accomplished once in each 6-month period (i.e. Jan-Jun, Jul-Dec).

4.6. Loss of Currency up to 6 Months. Individuals who are non-current in one or more
continuation training events will be placed in supervised status for those events and declared N-
BMC/N-CMR (N/A for Instructor/Evaluator Duties and Touch & Go Landings). Currency will
be regained by demonstrating proficiency with an instructor of like specialty for delinquent items
IAW AFI 11-202V1. Pilots and Engineers can maintain or regain currency in the simulator for
those events listed in Table 4.3 & Table 4.5. (T-3)
AFI11-2E-4V1 16 OCTOBER 2014                                                                  31


4.7. Loss of Currency Exceeding 6 Month Tables 4. 3. - 4.13 Establish which currency items
result in unqualified status requiring requalification according to paragraph 2.6 (T-3)
4.8. Commercial Contract Aircraft Continuation Training. When commercial contract B-
747 training (wet lease) is available, pilots and flight engineers will maximize logging flying
events in that aircraft under the provisions of the commercial vendor. Events that are not
necessarily E-4 specific should be accomplished and counted for currency and volume. Complete
mission accomplishment reports as you would for an E-4 sortie. (T-3)
   4.8.1. Flight Attendants will complete an FAA approved commercial training course for
   passenger type aircraft annually. This training will also fill the requirement for Water
   Survival Training. The contractor’s FAA-approved CRM course should be included and
   satisfies the AFI 11-290 Cockpit/Crew Resource Management biannual requirement. (T-3)
4.9. Aircrew Chemical Defense Ensemble (ACDE) Training. E-4 crewmembers by nature of
their mission are exempt from the aircrew chemical defense ensemble.
