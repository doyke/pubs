                                             Chapter 2

                                 LATAM COOP FUND USAGE

2.1. Purpose. The LATAM COOP Fund shall be used to further the standing and prestige of
the United States (US) and the USAF with Latin American countries/air forces by providing the
financial means whereby cooperation between the US and Latin America may be achieved and
enhanced. For purposes of this instruction, Latin America is defined as South and Central
America, Mexico, the Greater and Lesser Antilles, and all Caribbean islands excluding Puerto
Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Bermuda.
2.2. Unauthorized Uses. Do not use the LATAM COOP Fund for:
     2.2.1. Funding official travel to replace or supplement money allotted to Foreign Military
     Sales (FMS) cases, programs funded by FMS surcharge money, or other security assistance
     programs.
     2.2.2. Materials or services normally charged to other USAF funds.
     2.2.3. Expenses to circumvent or supplement other legal provisions.
     2.2.4. Any forms of greeting cards or business cards.
     2.2.5. Gifts intended as repayment for courtesies shown or hospitality received.
     2.2.6. Gratuities or allowances (except standard tipping practices).
     2.2.7. Paying for unit or individual training programs or courses for US personnel.
     2.2.8. Official functions that do not encourage cooperation with Latin American countries.
     2.2.9. Telephone calls (except for official business).
     2.2.10. Leisure activities or entertainment requested by authorized guests.
2.3. Authorized Uses. The highest payback for USAF and government interests are initiatives
in operations, logistics, and safety. Initiatives involving public affairs, legal and medical
exchanges are also important in military-to-military relations and should take precedence over
other non-operational initiatives. Use the LATAM COOP Fund for:
     2.3.1. Exchanges, orientations, or visits to familiarize US and partner nation military leaders
     with organizations, leaders, and subjects of mutual interest.
     2.3.2. Receptions, lunches, dinners, and cultural events that honor prominent Latin American
     officers or students.
     2.3.3. Official mementos and items exchanged according to US and Latin America customs,
     as limited by US laws and DoD and AF regulations and policies. The aggregate cost of all
     mementos and items presented to authorized recipients (and spouse where appropriate) by
     US personnel on any one occasion may not exceed the “minimal value” as established and
     periodically changed in Title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Section 102-42. That
     amount is currently $350.00; however, personnel should consult SAF/IARA for any
     clarification required. Mementos and items received from foreign officials must be
     processed in accordance with AFI 51-901, Gifts from Foreign Governments.
AFI16-102 29 MAY 2014                                                                       5


  2.3.4. Translation or interpreter services supporting goals of LATAM cooperation programs
  and initiatives funded by the LATAM COOP Fund.
  2.3.5. Official travel and subsistence for Latin American officers and students while they
  visit the US or US installations or activities overseas in accordance with the Joint Federal
  Travel Regulations (JFTR) and Joint Travel Regulations (JTR).
     2.3.5.1. Latin American Spouse Travel. Components shall submit requests for funded
     spouse travel to SAF/IARA for coordination. Requests for LATAM COOP to fund the
     travel of the spouses accompanying Latin American officers and students traveling under
     this AFI shall be approved by only the Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force,
     International Affairs, or the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force,
     International Affairs (T-1).
  2.3.6. Travel and subsistence for US representatives in the US or overseas who are traveling
  solely for the purpose of fostering cooperation with Latin American countries. When US
  personnel escort an official party, use only the minimum number of escorts required.
     2.3.6.1. US Spouse Travel. If spouse travel is approved in accordance with relevant
     USAF regulations (AFI 24-101, Transportation Passenger Movement), LATAM COOP
     funds may be used if the purpose of the travel is to solely foster cooperation with Latin
     American countries.

                                            Chapter 3

                                PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Annual Budget Request. SAF/IARA issues a one-year budget request in March of each
year to organizations authorized to execute LATAM COOP Fund financed activities under this
AFI. SAF/IARA develops the annual budget from the responses to the request.
3.2. Short Notice Requirements. If an agency requires immediate initiative funding or wants
to add requirements to its approved program, forward requests directly to SAF/IARA.
3.3. Supplemental Certification of funds for use as LATAM COOP. On request of the
agency or organization possessing O&M funds, SAF/IA may approve the allocation of
supplemental LATAM COOP authority for specific requirements beyond the annual LATAM
COOP program. Funding for supplemental LATAM COOP authority requirements may be
sourced from other O&M funds in accordance with applicable DoD and AF guidance; SAF/IA
will consult and coordinate with SAF/FMBOI, the Air Force O&M appropriation manager (T-2).
An agency or organization requesting LATAM COOP authority must:
     3.3.1. Present the request to SAF/IA in writing, stating the amount of funds it desires to be
     designated as LATAM COOP, along with a detailed explanation of how the funds would
     further the cause of Latin American cooperation and certification that the funds would be
     spent in accordance with the governing AFI.
     3.3.2. Requests for supplemental certification should be sent to the addresses listed in
     section 1.2.2 of this AFI.
     3.3.3. If the request is deemed appropriate, written authorization, noting the amount of funds
     spendable as LATAM COOP, shall be issued by only the Deputy Under Secretary of the Air
     Force, International Affairs, or the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force,
     International Affairs.
3.4. Approving Programs. SAF/IARA ensures all proposals for LATAM COOP funding
follow this instruction and contribute to regional cooperation and the USAF's overall strategy.
After SAF/IARA approves a request in concept, it informs the requesting agency, including what
changes are required and/or recommended and how much money is available.
3.5. Coordinating Activities. The requester and the base project officer must coordinate
public-relations activities, itineraries, transportation, and billeting. Visit authorizations for
foreign visitors to USAF installations must be requested from SAF/IAPD at least 30 days prior to
desired visit dates. Follow the Foreign Clearance Guide whenever US personnel visit foreign
locations.
3.6. Planning Social Functions. The LATAM COOP Fund is not Official Representational
Funds (ORF). While both categories involve O&M-type funds, LATAM COOP is distinguished
from ORF. Officials in charge of LATAM COOP funded events or activities should use
discretion in ensuring the event is executed with a minimum of funds required to meet the
mission of Latin American cooperation.
AFI16-102 29 MAY 2014                                                                               7


3.6.1. While not binding on LATAM COOP-funded events, the provisions in AFI 65-603
(Official Representation Funds) addressing numbers and selection of attendees, as well as the
ratios of participating groups, can be helpful in achieving the mission and should be guidelines.
3.6.2. Invitations should be extended to only the minimum number of DoD guests necessary to
extend proper courtesies and to execute the LATAM COOP-oriented mission. In this regard,
DoD personnel include US military members, DoD civilians, cadets, reservists on active duty,
members of the National Guard, and the spouses of these personnel (when appropriate, e.g., the
spouses of non-DoD guests will be invited).
3.7. Initiative Closeout. When the initiative is complete, responsible personnel at the command
utilizing the funds, (i.e. AFSOUTH, AFNORTH, USAFA, NORTHCOM, IAAFA, IADC,
SAF/IARA, or other command allotted LATAM COOP funds by SAF/IARA), shall do the
following:
   3.7.1. Write a detailed report regarding the utilization of the funds and forward that report to
   SAF/IARA (T-2). Maintain copies of all receipts and records as required by AFMAN 33-
   363.
   3.7.2. Following each LATAM COOP initiative, an after-action report shall be completed,
   including comments concerning the effectiveness of the initiative in meeting its stated
   purpose and the goals of the specific agency program. Include any recommendations for
   follow-on initiatives needed to further these objectives. Forward copies of these reports to all
   concerned agencies and to SAF/IARA at the address listed in 1.2.2., above (T-2).

                                FUNDING AND ACCOUNTING

4.1. Funding Distribution. SAF/IA will determine LATAM COOP budgetary requirements
each fiscal year and determine the appropriate method in which to allocate the distribution of
funds. If funding is available, SAF/IA may transfer funds to another organization from the
LATAM COOP Fund. Additionally, SAF/IA can assist with policy and guidance on the transfer
of appropriated funds from other organizations to/from SAF/IA for execution through the
LATAM COOP Program Element.
4.2. Approving and Accounting for Funds.
     4.2.1. An agency must not obligate more than the amount authorized per initiative without
     prior written approval from SAF/IA.
     4.2.2. Each accounting and finance office must account for obligations by the appropriate
     Air Force Element of Expense and Investment Code (EEIC) Object Class Code. File
     temporary duty and per diem claims under 409 EEICs. Charge expenses for official
     entertainment or mementos to applicable EEIC Object Class Code.
     4.2.3. Imprest cashiers or paying agents are liable for funds obligated or accepted.
     4.2.4. An agency must maintain a copy of each relevant document, e.g. TDY order,
     vouchers, purchase orders, paying agent orders, and its respective accounting documentation
     as required by AFMAN 33-363 (T-2).
