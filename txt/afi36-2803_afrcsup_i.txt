                                                 Chapter 2

       WHEN TO RECOMMEND AN INDIVIDUAL FOR A US MILITARY DECORATION


2.1. Eligibility. All military personnel on active duty are eligible for consideration for a US military dec-
oration. Members of Reserve components, while participating in authorized periods of training or while
in inactive status, are eligible for consideration of a military decoration. Recognize members assigned to
DoD activities with either an Air Force or DoD award. Do not use approval or disapproval of either the
Air Force or DoD award as the basis for consideration of the other award.
2.1. (AFRC) Eligibility. Members of Reserve components, while participating in authorized periods of
training, may be considered for military decorations provided the act, achievement, or service was in fur-
therance of Air Force mission or functions and meets the established criteria. However, acts, achieve-
ments, or services the Reserve member performs as a private citizen that are of principle benefit to private
citizens are not the basis for military decorations.

2.2. Submitting Recommendations:
     2.2.1. Do not submit recommendations in a token effort to "do something for your people."
     2.2.2. Restrict recommendations to recognizing meritorious service, outstanding achievement, or acts
     of heroism that clearly place individuals above his or her peers.
     2.2.3. Base recommendations on specific projects, plans, programs, or actions which are or will be
     beneficial to the Air Force.
     2.2.4. Superior duty performance, attainment of honors based solely on academic achievement (such
     as graduating with honors from a noncommissioned officer academy or other courses of instruction),
     or receipt of other forms of recognition (for example, selection as airman of the month or year or iden-
     tification as a superior performer by the Inspector General) do not in themselves justify a recommen-
     dation for a military decoration.
     2.2.5. Each decoration prescribes standards which define the degree and magnitude of an act,
     achievement, or service considered worthy for awarding that particular decoration. (See Table 2.1.)
     Do not base award of a specific decoration upon an individual's grade, but on the level of responsibil-
     ity and manner of performance.
     2.2.6. No individual is automatically entitled to an award upon completion of an operational TDY or
     departure for an assignment. Do not establish preconditions for an award. Do not use military deco-
     rations for incentives or as prizes in contests.
     2.2.7. Evaluate all related facts regarding the service of any person before recommending or award-
     ing a decoration.
     2.2.8. The reassignment or retirement of a commander or supervisor is not a basis for recommending
     decorations to subordinates.
     2.2.9. Award only one decoration for the same act, achievement, or period of service.
     2.2.10. Do not award or present a decoration to any person whose entire service for the period cov-
     ered by the decoration has not been honorable.
AFI36-2803_AFRC_I 11 OCTOBER 2006                                                                        11


2.3. Recommendations Based on Meritorious Service. Recommendations are based upon a completed
period of service.
   2.3.1. Permanent Change of Station (PCS). A move from one geographical area to another. If the
   recommendation is based on a single assignment, the closeout date will not be before the member’s
   final MPF out processing date. On rare occasions, i.e., base closure, unit deactivation, etc., consider a
   decoration for service involving assignments in two commands, providing the individual being reas-
   signed did not receive an award from losing command. The losing command must provide input for
   the service at that command and must concur with the level of decoration recommended.
   2.3.2. Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA). Reassignment from one unit to another on the same
   base or from one office or duty section to another located at the same organization. The new assign-
   ment must be markedly different from the previous duty to meet the intent of the completed period of
   service requirement.
   2.3.3. Extended Tour (EXT TOUR). Not a PCS or PCA, but clearly outstanding and unmistakably
   exceptional service for an extended period of at least 3 years for award of the Bronze Star Medal
   (BSM) and lesser decorations or at least 4 years for award of the LOM:
   2.3.3. (AFRC) Base extended tour submissions on date arrived on station or date of the last decora-
   tion awarded on station.
       2.3.3.1. Consider all completed period of service awards regardless of the time period elapsed
       after receiving an award under the extended tour provision, if the accomplishments or service war-
       rants a separate award.
   2.3.4. Retirement. Review records and consider the individual's entire career to determine the appro-
   priate level of decoration for retirement. Prepare the recommendation using the most recent period of
   service. NOTE: Decorations for retirement normally terminate on the last day of the month for Reg-
   ular Air Force personnel. Process recommendations for retirement in time for a presentation cere-
   mony and to permit processing and appropriate entries on retirement documents.

2.4. Recommendations Based on Outstanding Achievement. Recognize a single, specific act or
accomplishment separate and distinct from regularly assigned duties, such as successfully completing
important projects or on reaching major milestones of a long-term project or negotiations or accomplish-
ments in a temporary duty (TDY) status. (A significant project accomplished within regularly assigned
duties may meet the criteria.):
   2.4.1. An outstanding achievement award covers a short period of time with definite beginning and
   ending dates. Submit at any time within the prescribed time limits.
   2.4.2. Submit a recommendation only when you have no other way to recognize the achievement and
   waiting would diminish the significance of the accomplishment. Do not use outstanding achievement
   to justify decorations when the conditions for a completed period of service have not been met.
   2.4.3. You may recommend an award for meritorious service at the end of assignment even if the
   individual received an award for outstanding achievement during the time included in the recommen-
   dation; however, do not include previously recognized acts or achievements in the justification for the
   later award.

2.5. Recommendations Based on Heroism. Clearly state the act characterizes courage, intrepidity, or
gallantry. When the act involved voluntary risk of life, you must clearly show that the individual would
not have been censured had he or she not voluntarily accomplished the act.

2.6. Recommendations Based on Aerial Achievements. Recognize aircrew members involved with
operating aircraft or other personnel performing aircrew member duties. The recommendations must
clearly substantiate exceptional performance and outstanding airmanship above that normally expected of
professional airmen.

2.7. Posthumous Recommendations. Base posthumous awards using the same criteria you use for a liv-
ing person.

NOTES:
1. Refer to DoD 1348.33-M for authorization, specific award requirements, and brief description of these
decorations.
2. While engaged in an action against an enemy of the US, or while engaged in military operations
involving conflict with an opposing foreign force, or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged
in an armed conflict against an opposing force in which the US is not a belligerent party.
3. Awarded for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty.
See DoD 1348.33-M for courtesies and privileges. Award the Air Force design of the MOH on or after 1
November 1965. (Refer to Attachment 7 for application enrollment forms.)
4. Awarded for extraordinary heroism, not justifying award of the MOH.
5. Awarded for exceptionally meritorious service to the US in a duty of great responsibility. The basic
award may be made for a completed period of outstanding service; however, restrict subsequent awards
prior to retirement to extraordinary, specific achievements during one or more periods of service. This is
the highest peacetime Air Force decoration awarded.
6. Awarded for gallantry in action that does not warrant the MOH or AFC. Gallantry in action means her-
oism of high degrees including risk of life.
7. Awarded for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service to the US.
In peacetime, awards to US military personnel are limited to: Service in an extremely difficult duty that is
performed in a clearly exceptional manner, if such service is of marked national or international signifi-
cance to the Air Force or the DoD, or service that has aided the US in furthering its national policies, or
service which has furthered the interest or the security of the US or service that has furthered the interests
or the security of the US, or any nation allied or associated with the US during a period of national emer-
gency declared by the President or Congress. Superior performance of normal duties will not alone justify
award of this decoration.
8. There are four degrees awarded to foreign military personnel. (Degrees of Chief Commander, Com-
mander, Officer, and Legionnaire). Refer to DoD 1348.33-M for the specific award criteria for each
degree.
9. While participating in aerial flight. Heroism or achievement must be entirely distinctive, involving
operations that are not routine. Not awarded for sustained operational activities and flights.
10. Involving voluntary risk of life under conditions other than those of conflict with an armed enemy of

the basic creteria of the AFCM/AFAM, and who are exposed to personal hazards due to direct hostile
action during a contingency deployment operation. For a single event, Air Force Component Command-
ers may authorize the “V” device when a single event, i.e., terrorist act, isolated combat-type incident,
etc., warrants the “V’ device distinction. The “V” device will not be awarded for normal peacetime acts
or services. Award of the “V” device is authorized only for events or situations which occurred on or after
11 January 1996.

                                                    Chapter 3

                              GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES


3.1. Initiating a Recommendation. Submit recommendations as soon as possible following the act,
achievement, or service. Enter each recommendation (except the Purple Heart) into official channels
within 2 years and award within 3 years of the act, achievement, or service performed. NOTE: A recom-
mendation is placed in official channels when the recommending official signs the recommendation
(DECOR6 and justification) and a higher official in the chain of command endorses it.
     3.1.1. You may resubmit recommendations that were placed into official channels within the pre-
     scribed time limits, but no award was made because the recommendation was lost or was not pro-
     cessed or acted on due to administrative error. Reconsideration is contingent on the presentation of
     credible evidence that the recommendation was officially placed in military channels or was submit-
     ted, but not acted on through loss or inadvertence. Process the recommendation following the origi-
     nal channels. NOTE: When organizations no longer exist, process the recommendation through the
     replacement organizations.

3.2. Preparing a Recommendation. S u b m i t a R e c o m m e n d a t i o n f o r D e c o r a t i o n P r i n t o u t
(RDP-DECOR-6), descriptive justification, and citation for an individual recommendation. Submit an
RDP, descriptive justification, and citation for each person when more than one person is recommended
for the same decoration and for the same act, achievement, or service.
     3.2.1. Content. Classify recommendations according to content. Consider a recommendation "for
     official use only" until the awarding authority announces its final decision.
     3.2.2. Classified. Do not include any classified, highly sensitive, or special category information
     requiring special handling procedures in regular recommendations for decorations.
     3.2.3. RDP-DECOR6. Prepare an individual recommendation on an RDP-DECOR 6. Sign RDP and
     attach the justification.
        3.2.3.1. Use a memorandum or letter for an individual recommendation for a foreign officer, sep-
        arated member, or a member from another service. The memorandum or letter must contain same
        information as the RDP and must be signed.
     3.2.4. Descriptive Justification. Fully justify all award recommendations to avoid the perception that
     decorations are automatic. Avoid generalities, broad or vague terminology, superlative adjectives or
     a recapitulation of duties performed. The justification must provide concrete examples of exactly
     what the person did, how well he or she did it, what the impact or benefits were, and how that person
     significantly exceeded duty performance. Use the following formats:
        3.2.4.1. Prepare Air Force Achievement Medal (AFAM) justification on Air Force Form 642, Air
        Force Achievement Medal and Air Force Commendation Medal Justification or on the AF
        Form 2274, Air Force Achievement Medal Certificate.
        3.2.4.1. (AFRC) Do not use AF Form 2274, Air Force Achievement Medal, to justify award of
        the Air Force Achievement Medal within AFRC. Use the AF Form 642, Air Force Achievement
        Medal or Air Force Commendation Medal Justification , or bond paper when the description does
        not lend itself to the AF Form 642. Justification must be signed. Use appropriate signature block.
AFI36-2803_AFRC_I 11 OCTOBER 2006                                                                        17


       3.2.4.2. Prepare Air Force Commendation Medal justification (AFCM) on AF Form 642 or on
       bond paper when the description does not lend itself to the AF Form 642. Justification must be
       signed. Use appropriate signature block.
       3.2.4.3. You may use copies of EPR/OPRs, covering the award period, to justify the AFCM or the
       Meritorious Service Medal (MSM).
       3.2.4.4. Prepare other decoration justification as a narrative using a blocked, paragraphed, or talk-
       ing paper format (bullet). Limit Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) justification to three pages.
       A narrative justification is optional for retirement conditions for all grades for Active Duty Gen-
       eral Officers. Descriptive justification is required on all Air National Guard and Air Force
       Reserve personnel for all grades and decoration conditions. Limit Legion of Merit and lesser dec-
       oration justification to one page. Justification must be signed. Use appropriate signature block.
          3.2.4.4.1. (Added-AFRC) Prepare justification for the Meritorious Service Medal on AFRC
          Form 31, Meritorious Service Medal Nomination, or on bond paper when the description does
          not lend itself to the AFRC Form 31. Justification must be signed. Use the appropriate signa-
          ture block.
          3.2.4.4.2. (Added-AFRC) Prepare a descriptive justification for award of the DSM to Air
          Reserve personnel for all grades and decoration conditions. Justification for the Legion of
          Merit or lesser decorations based on retirement may be submitted using the endorsement
          memorandum (abbreviated format).
       3.2.4.5. Prepare justification for decorations based on retirement as an endorsement memoran-
       dum or letter or using the above formats.
   3.2.5. Citations. To complete citations, see Attachment 4 and Attachment 5.
   3.2.6. Additional Attachments. A recommendation may include: supporting documentation, if the
   person initiating the recommendation does not have firsthand knowledge of the act or service per-
   formed or official supporting records. Attach a copy of the citation for outstanding achievement to the
   recommendation when a decoration based on outstanding achievement was awarded during the period
   of service being recognized by a meritorious service recommendation.

3.3. Processing a Recommendation. Forward all recommendations through the normal chain of com-
mand of the person being recommended. The commander or vice commander at each headquarters des-
ignated to review recommendations must personally review and sign the forwarding endorsement for
each. Each intermediate commander must recommend approval or disapproval of the recommendation or
recommend award of a higher or lesser decoration:
3.3. (AFRC) Processing a Recommendation. All processing levels forward recommendations to the
next higher echelon for processing or return recommendations for correction within 5 workdays of
receipt. Intermediate commanders or vice commanders use AFRC Form 30, AFRC Indorsement for Dec-
oration, or AFRC Form 31, Meritorious Service Medal Nomination, to forward recommendations to the
next level of command. Comments are not required on the form and will not enhance the likelihood of
approval
   3.3.1. Forward recommendations placed in official channels to the designated approval or disap-
   proval authority for final action regardless of whether intermediate endorsing officials or commanders
   determine the award does not meet the criteria.
18                                                            AFI36-2803_AFRC_I 11 OCTOBER 2006


     3.3.1. (AFRC) Forward recommendations for decoration for which HQ AFRC is the final approval
     authority to arrive at HQ AFRC/A1BB at least 60 days prior to the desired presentation date. Submit
     an original and three copies of the recommendation and an original and seven copies of the citation.
     3.3.2. Process recommendations submitted on individuals or on a group of individuals from various
     organizations to recognize a single act or outstanding achievement through the project or operation
     commander's chain of command. Obtain concurrence from the recommendee's commander prior to
     submitting the recommendation.
     3.3.2. (AFRC) Forward recommendations for decoration which require HQ USAF approval to arrive
     at HQ AFRC/A1BB at least 60 days prior to the desired presentation date.
     3.3.3. Forward recommendations requiring SAF approval through command channels to HQ AFPC/
     DPPPRA. Send original and one copy of the DECOR 6, narrative, endorsement correspondence, and
     original, and 6 copies of the citation, with social security number (SSN). Enter a personnel transac-
     tion (PERSTRAN HCS40) into the system. Verify the transaction was accepted prior to sending the
     decoration package to HQ AFPC/DPPPRA. If the recommendation is classified, send the unclassified
     portion to HQ AFPC/DPPPRA and send the classified portion under separate cover directly to HQ
     AFPC/DPPPRA. Forward recommendations for Air Force decorations from joint or unified com-
     mands to HQ 11th Wing.
     3.3.4. Forward recommendations for Air Force decorations to sister service personnel to the Air
     Force commander who exercises awarding authority as if the individual were an Air Force member.
     Obtain written concurrence through HQ AFPC/DPPPRA from the individual's parent service before
     final approval. Provide HQ AFPC/DPPPRA with two complete copies of the recommendation pack-
     age.
     3.3.5. Process decorations for centrally managed reservists (those assigned to the Chaplain, Medical,
     Legal, AFOSI, or Intelligence career fields) to approval or disapproval authority at the local level (the
     same as active duty personnel) using the award approving authority of the unit of attachment. Deco-
     ration recommendations for individual reservists will be processed to the award authority for consid-
     eration as outlined in Table 3.3..
     3.3.6. Reviewing officials at any level may return recommendations for administrative correction or
     for more supporting data. Do not consider these recommendations as having been removed from offi-
     cial channels, but return them without delay to the reviewing or awarding authority.
     3.3.6. (AFRC) Return incorrect recommendations to the last indorsing headquarters for correction.
     After correction, send recommendation to the next higher echelon of command.
     3.3.7. Recommending officials who wish to withdraw recommendations already in official channels
     must send a memorandum or letter through command channels to the awarding authority requesting
     disapproval, with reasons. Intermediate endorsing officials or commanders must forward these rec-
     ommendations. Their endorsement must recommend either approval or disapproval to the awarding
     authority.
     3.3.8. Forward requests for reconsidering disapproved or downgraded recommendations through the
     same official channels as the original recommendation. The justification for reconsideration must be
     in memorandum or letter format, not to exceed one page. Attach a copy of the original recommenda-
     tion with all endorsements and new citation. Submit request into official channels within 1 year of the
     date of the awarding authority's decision. A one-time reconsideration by the award authority is final.
AFI36-2803_AFRC_I 11 OCTOBER 2006                                                                         19


3.4. Completing a Recommendation. Once an award has been approved, prepare a certificate (Attach-
ment 7), impress a seal on the citation and publish special orders. See Table 3.1. for distribution of the
elements. See Table 3.2. for actions on disapproved decorations:
   3.4.1. Reflect the oak leaf cluster or V device, if applicable, on the certificate and/or citation. A des-
   ignated authority signs the certificates. Include the duty title below the signature. Place the word
   "Posthumous" below the decoration's title on the citation when the basis for the award is posthumous.
   Do not place Posthumous on the certificate.
   3.4.2. Publish the authority for awarding a decoration in the award authority's special order. The
   effective date of all decorations is the closing date of the service period recognized regardless of the
   order date:
       3.4.2.1. Special orders announcing approved decorations must include award authority and
       descriptive basis for the award; recipient's grade, name, social security number (SSN), personnel
       accounting symbol (PAS) code, the date the recommendation for decoration printout (RDP) was
       computer generated, and the condition code. Identify members of the other branches of the Armed
       Forces and foreign military personnel accordingly. Include also the number of the oak leaf cluster
       or valor, if applicable; statement that decoration is posthumous, if applicable; date or period cov-
       ered; effective date, when publishing order before closing date of the period covered; and the
       effective date of the period covered. See Table 3.1. and Attachment 6 for appropriate descriptive
       basis for the decorations and additional information for preparing orders.
       3.4.2.2. Publish special orders relating to foreign nationals and posthumous decorations and dis-
       patch with other award elements.
       3.4.2.3. Award decorations in order of the service performed. However, you can base the decora-
       tion sequence on the order in which the decoration was approved when operational conditions pre-
       vented a chronological processing of the award.

3.5. Refused Decorations. A member may refuse to accept an approved decoration and may elect not to
wear that decoration. File documents which prove the individual did not accept the award along with a
copy of the citation and special order in his or her UPRG. Update the decoration as an approved award.
Do not revoke the special order.

3.6. Presenting Decorations. Timely presentation is essential. Hold the presentation ceremony at the
earliest possible date after the award was approved:
3.6. (AFRC) Presenting Decorations. Present awards within 90 days after the recipient arrives on sta-
tion or the decoration elements are received, whichever happens later.
   3.6.1. When a second or later award of the same decoration is presented, except in awards to foreign
   nationals and those presented posthumously, the appropriate basic medal, with one or more oak leaf
   clusters (OLC) attached to the suspension ribbon, is used for presentation only (an OLC to a decora-
   tion does not indicate it is a higher award than the basic decoration). After the ceremony, take the pre-
   sentation elements back and give the recipient the OLC.
   3.6.2. When presenting the OLC to a foreign national, attach it to the appropriate medal and ribbon
   bar. The recipient retains the complete decoration.

     3.6.3. Give the next of kin decorations which were not presented because of the recipient's death. The
     next of kin listed in order of precedence are: spouse, child/children, parents, brother, or sister. When
     presenting decorations to the primary next of kin, give, at no cost, duplicate elements of the decoration
     to the parents of the deceased. Present the duplicate elements during the ceremony held for the
     spouse, if everyone agrees, or deliver or mail them. Do not hold a separate ceremony for presenting
     duplicate elements. Present all decorations earned but not presented before the recipient's death at one
     ceremony. Hold presentation ceremonies according to the wishes of the next of kin.

3.7. Revoking Decorations. Revoke an award if facts, later determined, would have prevented original
approval of the award. Award authorities must seek legal advice from their base judge advocate when-
ever there is doubt as to the propriety of an award action:
     3.7.1. The awarding authority revokes an award when the basis for the award no longer exists, for
     example cancellation of retirement or PCS.

3.8. Special Procedures for Decorations Arising from Combat Operations:
     3.8.1. To ensure consistency of decorations arising from combat operations, the NAF and JTF/CTF
     Air Force component commanders shall forward, in a timely manner, all recommendations for deco-
     rations arising out of combat operations not within their authority to approve, to the MAJCOM Com-
     mander serving as the air component commander to the supported CINC (or in the absence of such an
     officer, to a lieutenant general or general designated by CSAF for this purpose). To ensure timely rec-
     ognition and accurate substantiation, nominating officials should submit award nominations within 45
     days of the flight or event that supports the award. In the case of hostilities of limited duration, the
     NAF or JTF/CTF Air Force component commanders should have all recommendations submitted
     within 90 days after the cessation of hostilities. The MAJCOM commander, or CSAF designee, will
     consolidate decoration recommendations submitted by the NAF or Air Force component command-
     ers. To the extent feasible, they should be evaluated only after they have been aggregated, but the ben-
AFI36-2803_AFRC_I 11 OCTOBER 2006                                                                    25


  efits of aggregation (and associated delays) should be balanced against the goal of timely recognizing
  individuals’ accomplishments. If there is a singular, distinctive event, or other unusual factors that
  support expediting an award, that award should be processed without aggregation and the nomination
  package should include an explanation of the reason for expedited processing. After review, the MAJ-
  COM commander, or CSAF designee, will forward those recommendations that he or she finds meet
  the criteria for awards to be approved above the MAJCOM level, to the Decoration Board of the Air
  Force Personnel Council.
     3.8.1.1. As long as submissions meet the timeliness requirements established by law or DOD
     guidance, proper and substantiated award recomendations will not be disapproved (or foregone)
     on the basis that they did not comply with the time goals discussed above.
  3.8.2. The Director, Secretary of the Air Foce Personnel Council (SAFPC), will approve or recom-
  mend approval of those awards he or she determines meet the award criteria and are fully substanti-
  ated.
     3.8.2.1. Resubmission and Reconsideration Procedures. If the Director, SAFPC, finds that a nom-
     ination package does not meet the award criteria, or does not adequately substantiate the proposed
     award, he/she will return the package to the proposing MAJCOM commander with a written
     explanation of the perceived deficiency. The Director, SAFPC, may also suggest other awards he/
     she finds appropriate. The MAJCOM commander may then seek review of the package by SAF/
     OS, through SAF/MI and then CSAF. In that event, the MAJCOM commander may submit any
     revised or additional substantiation to the SAFPC. If the Director, SAFPC, does not then change
     his view and grant the proposed award, he must forward the package to SAF/MI, with SAFPC’s
     comments and recommendations. SAF/MI may then approve the award, to the extent such award
     is within the approval authority of the Director, SAFPC, and notify the MAJCOM commander to
     that effect. If SAF/MI does not approve the award, he/she shall forward the package to SAF/OS,
     through CSAF, with recommendations for final decision. CSAF may provide recommendations
     to SAF/OS, or may disapprove the award.
     3.8.2.2. At any point in the reconsideration process, the proposing MAJCOM may agree to
     approval of a different award within the approval authority of the Director, SAFPC, or request the
     nomination package be withdrawn.

                    UNITED STATES UNIT AND ORGANIZATIONAL AWARDS


4.1. Granting and Restricting Unit Awards. Grant unit awards to military units that distinguish them-
selves during peacetime or in action against hostile forces or an armed enemy of the US. Restrict awards
to recognizing acts or services that place the unit's performance significantly above that of other units of
similar composition and mission responsibility. Only grant one award for the same act, achievement, or
service. Ensure only 10 percent of similar units assigned to their command are recommended annually.
For one-of-a-kind units, the awards will be based on each unit's merits. Provide HQ AFPC/DPPPRA with
a summary listing of all approved units, with the inclusive dates, special order number, date, and condi-
tions.
     4.1.1. A unit award based on an outstanding achievement does not preclude a second award based on
     meritorious service. Do not include the justification used to substantiate the outstanding achievement
     award in the recommendation for meritorious service. The unit's entire service must have been hon-
     orable during the distinguished act.

4.2. Individual Entitlement. All assigned or attached people who served with a unit during a period for
which a unit award was awarded are authorized the appropriate ribbon if they directly contributed to the
mission and accomplishments of the unit.

4.3. Specific Unit Awards. For authorization, eligibility requirements, and special provisions for the
Presidential Unit Citation, Joint Meritorious Unit Award, and Sister Service Unit Awards, refer to DoD
1348.33-M, Manual of Military Decorations and Awards:

     ing types of units are eligible for consideration:

      4.4.1.6. Do not award to Foreign Armed Forces organizations or elements.

4.5. Units Sharing in the AFOUA or AFOEA:
   4.5.1. Subordinate activities do not automatically share in an award with the parent unit or organiza-
   tion. Organizations can share their award only with like subordinate organizations (i.e., for a num-
   bered parent organization, only numbered subordinate units may share; for an unnumbered parent
   organization, only unnumbered subordinate units may share unless otherwise specified in this AFI).
   4.5.2. Identify each sharing subordinate activity in the parent organization nomination.

ple, American or European-African-Middle Eastern Theater, and Asiatic-Pacific Theater during World
War II, and the military operations in Korea and Southeast Asia):

(JCS), authorized by the DoD, and announced in DoD Manual 1348.33):

 AIR FORCE ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS AND THE AIR FORCE GOOD CONDUCT MEDAL


5.1. Air Force Achievement Awards. See Table 5.1. for a list of awards, specific eligibility require-
ments and criteria:
   5.1.1. Make only one award of a specific Air Force achievement award to the same person. Award
   devices to denote additional awards.
   5.1.2. Air Force members may accept achievement awards awarded by a sister service. Refer to AFI
   36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, Awards and Decorations Figure
   4-1, for authorized awards and instructions on how to wear these awards.

5.2. Air Force Good Conduct Medal (AFGCM). Awarded to personnel in an enlisted status for "exem-
plary conduct" (exemplary behavior, efficiency, and fidelity), while in active military service of the US.
Individuals must demonstrate a positive attitude toward the Air Force and their jobs:
   5.2.1. Service performed in a sister service is not creditable for awarding the AFGCM.
   5.2.2. Aviation cadet or officer candidate status is creditable toward award of the AFGCM. Service
   as a cadet in the Air Force Academy is not creditable.
   5.2.3. Award the AFGCM for periods of continuous service as outlined in Table 5.2..
   5.2.4. Award the Air Force Good Conduct Medal based upon specific recommendation of the unit
   commander.
   5.2.5. The MPF furnishes the AFGCM selection listing to non-PCIII units monthly to each member's
   unit commander reflecting those individuals awarded the AFGCM for the current month. For PCIII
   units, the AFGCM selection listing is produced monthly and can be found in end of month (EOM) in
   office automation at each unit. This roster reflects individuals awarded the AFGCM for the current
   month.
   5.2.6. The system automatically updates the award based on a 3-year period of continuous service
   from the AFGCM start date.
   5.2.7. The AFGCM is conspicuous by its absence. Failure to qualify for the award casts doubt on an
   individual's value as a member of the Air Force.
   5.2.8. Commanders:
       5.2.8.1. May deny the award in those cases where an individual's conduct has been less than
       exemplary.
       5.2.8.2. Will consider the immediate supervisor's recommendation in exercising their prerogative
       to deny the award.
       5.2.8.3. Prepare a memorandum or letter stating the period involved for denying or adjusting the
       award and the new start date. Commanders initiate the denial letter in conjunction with other
       action (i.e., UIF, control roster actions, or letter of reprimand) relating to the incident.

        5.2.8.4. Forward the letter to the MPF for update of the PDS, if you do not have PC-III capability,
        and filing in the individual's personnel records. If you have PCIII, update adjustment to creditable
        service dates and forward to Customer Service for filing in the individual’s personnel records.

3. Once credit is given for the overseas tour, PDS will automatically update. For personnel who extend
their original overseas tour, award the ribbon when the member enters the extension. Make only one
award for the entire period unless the extension results in the individual being credited with another tour.
4. The PDS screens the member's total active federal military service date (TAFMSD) and updates the
award based on completing 4 years military service. Service at the Uniformed Services University of
Health Sciences (USUHS) is active duty service and creditable toward award of the AFLSAR. Use Air
Force Form 104, Service Medal Award Verification, to annotate creditable awards of the AFLSAR to
reflect combined periods of service.
5. Awarded for a period of 4 continuous years service computed from the date of assignment to a training
category A, B or D for individuals with a beginning date before 1 July 1972. For individuals with a begin-
ning date after 30 June 1972, the length of service requirement is 3 continuous years’ of service. Award
individuals who accrue at least 1 year but less than 3 years toward award of the medal and terminate their
enlisted Reserve status as a commissioned or warrant officer the medal regardless of the beginning eligi-
bility date. Creditable service ends when called to active duty. A period of more than 24 hours between
reserve enlistments counts as a break in service. Credit must begin anew after the break. An active duty
period is not a break in service. Do not credit service performed in the US Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or
Coast Guard Reserve components. When determining service computation, exclude service as a commis-
sioned officer.
6. Automatically updated when PME graduation certification data is entered in the PDS. Do not award
the ribbon to members who only complete the correspondence courses or similar training conducted by
other military services except for completion of the US Army Sergeant Major Academy or the Navy
Senior Enlisted Academy.
7. Award ribbon only once no matter how many times an individual scores "expert." Add bronze service
star to the ribbon for those personnel who, after 22 June 1972, meet the award criteria with both the M16
rifle and issue handgun. Add only one star regardless of the number of times a person qualifies with both
weapons. Use AF Form 522, USAF Ground Weapons Training Data or letter from the Small Arms
Marksmanship Monitor as the source document for this award.
8. May not be awarded for completing technical training, career development courses, and other services'
basic training. Completing later accession training (BMT, then commissioning through a program, and so
forth) will entitle a member to a subsequent award denoted by an oak leaf cluster.

4. Not applicable if the basic award of the medal has been made.

period between enlistments or between commissioned and enlisted service periods constitutes a break in
continuous active service.

NOTES:
1. HQ AFPC/DPPPRA will determine eligibility and make award of the POW medal to members cur-
rently serving on active duty, or with the Air National Guard, or Air Force Reserves.
2. After 1 July 1973, awarded for 30 days of assigned duty at sea or ashore, south of latitude 60 degrees
South. Awarded for 15 days assigned duty at an outlying station on the Antarctic continent. Days do not
need to be consecutive. Starting 1 July 1987, awarded to flight crews providing logistics support from
outside the Antarctic area after 15 missions. One flight in or out during a 24-hour period equals one mis-
sion.
3. Specifically excluded from eligibility for the HSM are members or elements remaining at geographi-
cally separated locations or who were assigned to the location, but did not make a direct contribution to,
nor influence the action. Members seeking the HSM for past operations must provide documentation to
the MPF verifying their direct participation in the operation. Forward HSM recommendations originating
within the Air Force through command channels to HQ AFPC/DPPPRA. Refer to DoD 1348.33-M for
specific guidance on preparing recommendations. Award of the HSM does not preclude or conflict with
other medals or ribbons awarded on the basis of unit achievement or individual achievements or valor.
4. Refer to DoD 1348.33-M for the definition of area of operations, degree of participation and direct sup-
port when determining individual eligibility for the award. Award the AFEM for operations for which no
other US campaign medal is approved.
5. Creditable service is when members accumulate a minimum of 50 retirement points during each anni-
versary year according to Title 10, U.S.C., Section 1332. Determine eligibility for the AFRM from AF

12301(a) of title 10 U.S.C. (full mobilization), section 1202 (partial mobilization), or section 12304 (Pres-
idential call-up). The “M” device may also be awarded if the member volunteered and served on active
duty in support of a designated contingency operation, as defined in title 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13). Partici-
pation in additional contingencies will be designated with an Arabic numeral. In the past, reservists had
to have 10 or more years service to qualify for the basic medal. Now, they can earn the medal not only for
service longevity but also service in a contingency. NOTE: If no “M” device is authorized, the appropri-
ate hourglass--bronze for 10 years service, silver for 20 years, gold for 30 years, or bronze and gold for 40
years will be worn. The appropriate hourglass goes in the center of the ribbon. If no hourglass is autho-
rized, the “M” device is centered on the ribbon, followed by the numeric device on the wearer’s left.

members of other than the Selected Reserve called to active duty (includes cadets with the USAF Acad-
emy). Ineligible are members called to active duty for the sole purpose of undergoing a physical exami-

NOTES:
1. SAF approved delegation is outlined in table above. Do not delegate these authorities further.
2. SAF retains award authority for the AFC, DSM, SS, Legion of Merit, DFC, and Airman’s Medal. The
Director, Secretary of the Air Force Personnel Council, acts on behalf of the SAF and approves or disap-
proves the recommendations. Exception: refer to Paragraph 3.8. for processing procedures for awards
arising out of combat operations. SAF approves all awards to US civilians and foreign military personnel
or makes appropriate recommendations to the Secretary of Defense. HQ AFPC/DPPPRA convenes the
USAF Purple Heart Review Board to finalize requests for the Purple Heart.


3.8. Special Procedures for Decorations Arising from Combat Operations:
3.8.1. To ensure consistency of decorations arising from combat operations, the NAF and JTF/CTF Air
Force component commanders shall forward, in a timely manner, all recommendations for decorations
arising out of combat operations not within their authority to approve, to the MAJCOM Commander serv-
ing as the air component commander to the supported CINC (or in the absence of such an officer, to a
lieutenant general or general designated by CSAF for this purpose). To ensure timely recognition and
accurate substantiation, nominating officials should submit award nominations within 45 days of the
flight or event that supports the award. In the case of hostilities of limited duration, the NAF or JTF/CTF
Air Force component commanders should have all recommendations submitted within 90 days after the
cessation of hostilities. The MAJCOM commander, or CSAF designee, will consolidate decoration rec-
ommendations submitted by the NAF or Air Force component commanders. To the extent feasible, they
should be evaluated only after they have been aggregated, but the benefits of aggregation (and associated
delays) should be balanced against the goal of timely recognizing individuals’ accomplishments. If there
is a singular, distinctive event, or other unusual factors that support expediting an award, that award
should be processed without aggregation and the nomination package should include an explanation of
the reason for expedited processing. After review, the MAJCOM commander, or CSAF designee, will
forward those recommendations that he or she finds meet the criteria for awards to be approved above the
MAJCOM level, to the Decoration Board of the Air Force Personnel Council.
3.8.1.1. As long as submissions meet the timeliness requirements established by law or DOD gudiance,
proper and substantiated award recommendations will not be disapproved (or foregone) on the basis that
they did not comply with the time goals discussed above.
3.8.2. The Director, Secretary of the Air Force Personnel Council (SAFPC), will or recommand approval
of those awards he or she determines meet the award criteria and are fully substantited.
AFI36-2803_AFRC_I 11 OCTOBER 2006                                                                     77


3.8.2.1. Resubmission and Reconsideration Procedures. If the Director, SAFPC, finds that a nomination
package does not meet the award criteria, or does not adequately substantiate the proposed award, he/she
will return the package to the proposing MAJCOM commander with a written explanation of the per-
ceived deficiency. The Director, SAFPC, may also suggest other awards he/she finds appropriate. The
MAJCOM commander may then seek review of the package by SAF/OS, through SAF/MI and then
CSAF. In that event, the MAJCOM commander may submit any revised or additional substantiation to
the SAFPC. If the Director, SAFPC, does not then change his view and grant the proposed award, he must
forward the package to SAF/MI, with SAFPC’s comments and recommendations. SAF/MI may then
approve the award, to the extent such award is within the approval authority of the Director, SAFPC, and
notify the MAJCOM commander to that effect. If SAF/MI does not approve the award, he/she shall for-
ward the package to SAF/OS, through CSAF, with recommendations for final decision. CSAF may pro-
vide recommendations to SAF/OS, or may disapprove the award.
3.8.2.2. At any point in the reconsideration process, the proposing MAJCOM may agree to approval of a
different award within the approval authority of the Director, SAFPC, or request the nomination package
be withdrawn.

has completed (number of operational missions as appropriate) according to AFI 36-2803, Table 2.1., and
AFRC Supplement, and is eligible for award of the Aerial Achievement Medal.” The Operations Group
Commander signs underneath this statement verifying the number of missions flown and compliance with
AFI 36-2803. When this statement is used, no other justification is needed.
A9.6. (Added-AFRC) Approval authorities consider only those recommendations which clearly sub-
stantiate exceptional performance and outstanding airmanship above that normally expected of profes-
sional airmen. Completion of the required number of missions does not in itself justify the award. As with
all other military decorations, the individual must be officially recommended for the decoration.
