1. Introduction.
   1.1. This has been compiled to assist the facility manager in managing the Air Force facilities located
   on McConnell AFB. The facility manager is the key to effective management for repairs, use, care of
2                                                   MCCONNELLAFBI32-9002 1 DECEMBER 2004


    facilities, and the energy management within the facility. The facility manger should call Civil Engi-
    neer (CE) Customer Service Unit for assistance.

2. Appointment.
    2.1. The Base Civil Engineer has established the requirement and defined the responsibilities of the
    facility manager, including instructions for their assignment and relief. The following information
    should assist you in the performance of you duties as facility manager.
    2.2. Organization commanders are assigned required facilities upon approval of the Base Facilities
    Board. The commanders assume responsibility for the facilities used by their organization and the
    real property installed equipment therein. The facility manager, as the commander’s representative,
    should have the authority and ability to perform the responsibilities.
    2.3. The organization commander will designate an officer, E-4 and above, or civilian equivalent as
    primary and alternate facility manager for each building assigned to that organization and advise the
    22 CES Customer Service Unit (CSU), in writing, of the assignment. Provide names, organization,
    office symbol, duty telephone numbers, home phone numbers and e-mail address on Attachment 2.
    The facility manager will obtain the proper coordination on Attachment 5. Any changes in facility
    managers will be sent in writing to 22 CES/CEOFC, 10 days prior to the desired change date. Man-
    agement support is required to keep facility manager changes to a minimum, since frequent changes
    adversely affect the level of support that can be provided to the facility. Assigned managers should
    have at least one year retainability left on their assignment to be appointed.
    2.4. If there is more than one organization located in a facility, the major user will assign the primary
    and alternate facility manager. An assistant facility manager may be appointed in multipurpose facil-
    ities for their respective areas if necessary. Assistant facility managers will report problems within
    their areas to the primary or alternate facility manager. Only the primary or the alternate should ini-
    tiate or coordinate corrective action through CSU. Buildings not having a valid facility manager who
    has attended the mandatory training, may not receive routine maintenance and material support until
    such a time as the required obligation(s) have been fulfilled. Emergency requirements can be initiated
    by anyone.

3. Duties and Procedures:
    3.1. The facility manager, in cooperation with occupants and users of facilities, is responsible for the
    care, custody, and protection of the assigned real property facility. Every effort should be exercised to
    safeguard the property from damage or loss. The facility manager serves in an administrative and
    advisory capacity.
    3.2. Real Property Facility Manager Log. Facility managers will establish and maintain a folder for
    each facility to aid in the duties and responsibilities assigned. The folder should include the follow-
    ing, with other information added as deemed necessary by the facility manager.

  3.3. Key Control. Facility managers will ensure strict key control of their facility and establish pro-
  cedures for turn-in of keys. A key control roster will be maintained and used as a tool in managing
  effective key control in facilities. All keys from personnel going PCS, on extended leave or on TDY
  for over 30 days will be repossessed and held for safekeeping by the facility managers until their
  return. All requests for keys will be initiated by the facility manager and forwarded to CSU on an AF
  Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, and will include facility number, room number (if
  applicable), facility manager’s duty phone, and complete justification. Replacement keys for other
  than normal wear and tear will be the monetary responsibility of the individual to whom the keys were
  issued. Additional keys will be provided by CSU if justification is sufficient and the request is
  approved. All requests for master keys require the organization commander’s signature.
  3.4. Facility Security. The facility manager will establish a standard procedure for assuring their
  facility is secure from illegal entry. Rules for the opening and closing of facilities during normal duty
  hours, for after hours admittance, and security measures to be observed should be posted by the facil-
  ity manager. Facility manager is responsible for all breaches in building security and must take cor-
  rective action.
  3.5. Emergency Conditions. When emergencies occur, notify CE Customer Service Unit (x5734/
  5735) immediately describing the problem and what interim action is being taken or is required to
  minimize damage or loss to real property. After duty hours, phones will be forwarded to the alarm
  room at the Fire Department. Facility managers should be familiar with the location and operation of
  utility controls so they may be shut off in emergencies. The facility manager should maintain a log
  with the work order number provided by the facility maintenance controller. Date and time of com-
  pletion should also be annotated.
  3.6. Maintenance and Repair. Conducting monthly inspections of the assigned facility will readily
  identify maintenance and repair requirements and its real property installed equipment, with particular
  attention to doors, window, glass, lights, plumbing, heating, and ventilation air conditioning equip-
  ment, to determine the condition of the property. Needed maintenance and repair will be annotated on
  AF Form 1219, BCE Multi-Craft Job Order. Facility Maintenance personnel will conduct an inspec-
  tion every 60 days on high use facilities and semi-annually on low use facilities to identify minor
  maintenance and repair. The facility manager is highly encouraged to accompany the Facility Main-
  tenance supervisor on these inspections.
  3.7. New Construction and Self-Help. When new construction or self-help is requested, AF Form
  332 should be prepared by occupants and/or users of the building and forwarded to the facility man-
  ager for review. After reviewing the request, the facility manager should date and initial in one of the
  coordination blocks on the AF
  Form 332. The facility manager should then obtain the signature of the organization commander or
  their designated representative. Assist and participate in periodic surveys of the assigned facility and
  furnish justification to support alteration and modification projects resulting from changes in the mis-
  sion.
  3.8. Custodial Services. Timely and effective custodial services inspections by the facility manager
  are imperative to ensure that all custodial services performed for the organization are accomplished in
  accordance with custodial services contract. Each facility manager must be familiar with the terms of
  the contract, areas to be serviced and frequencies of service. It is the duty of the facility manager to
4                                                    MCCONNELLAFBI32-9002 1 DECEMBER 2004


    ensure that all unsatisfactory or incomplete work is documented and reported to 22 CES/CEOE at
    extensions 3932 or 4458 with the dumpster number, facility number, and nature of problem.
       3.8.1. As a general guideline, items should not extend out of the dumpster.
       3.8.2. Recyclable items will not be discarded in the dumpsters. Refer to Attachment 3 for McCo-
       nnell AFB Recycling Plan.
    3.9. Land Management and Ground Maintenance. Facility managers are responsible for the outside
    appearance of their facilities, out to 25 feet from the building, especially prior to VIP visits. For facil-
    ities with multiple squadrons, the squadron commanders must agree upon whom the responsibility of
    managing the facility exterior belongs. This also includes your flowerbeds and shrubs around your
    building. It is your responsibility to weed, plant, trim or remove dead plants/shrubs and trash. Facility
    managers are also responsible for clearing the sidewalks of their facility of snow and ice during the
    winter. Salt/sand will not be supplied by the Civil Engineering Squadron.
    3.10. Fire Prevention. The facility managers/supervisors should ensure that fire prevention orienta-
    tion and training of assigned personnel is conducted. Supervisors at all levels are accountable for the
    enforcement of sound fire prevention practices in their work areas. Inform the Fire Protection Flight,
    Technical Services section (x3901) if any fire extinguishers are discharged or damaged and to report
    any damage to installed fire protection systems. The facility manager or designated representative
    will accompany the fire inspector during any fire inspection conducted. Unit commanders, supervi-
    sors, and facility managers must take immediate action to correct fire hazards noted during fire pre-
    vention inspections, and return AF Form 1487, Fire Prevention Visit Report, with corrective action
    taken to the Technical Services section within the time limit established by the Fire Department. Spe-
    cific guidelines and procedures can be found in MAFBI 32-2003.
    3.11. Lost or Damaged Property as a Result of Negligence
       3.11.1. If the individual(s) admits liability, a statement of acceptance will be typed in block 27 of
       the AF Form 332 and signed by the responsible individual(s). The AF Form 332 will be immedi-
       ately forwarded to BCE. CE Customer Service will forward a copy of AF Form 332, cost esti-
       mate, and a letter requesting assistance, to the unit commander of the individual responsible for
       loss, damage or destruction.
       3.11.2. Unit commanders will ensure that a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, is prepared
       and payment is collected or a DD Form 200, Report of Survey, is initiated prior to the discharge,
       TDY, or PCS of the responsible individual. BCE will, upon completion of repair or replacement,
       notify the unit commander in writing of the actual costs so reimbursement can be collected on the
       amount. In the event responsible individual(s) are scheduled for discharge, PCS, or TDY, dam-
       ages will be collected on estimates provided by CE Customer Service Unit. The unit commander
       will send a copy of the document showing evidence of reimbursement to CSU or Financial Man-
       agement. CSU will make follow-ups to insure that losses due to damage or destruction of real
       property are fully and completely accounted for either through payment by those responsible or by
       relief through report of survey action.
       3.11.3. Brief all facility occupants on their responsibility for the care, custody, and protection of
       the property including financial liability for loss and damage in excess of fair wear and tear.
       Encourage good housekeeping practices including conservation of utilities and establish proce-
       dures to ensure interior and exterior lights are switched off and the facility is secured when it is
       unoccupied.
MCCONNELLAFBI32-9002 1 DECEMBER 2004                                                                      5


  3.12. Energy Conservation. The facility managers are the key to an effective energy conservation
  program. A primary function of the facility manager is energy conservation. With the support of unit
  commanders, they can ensure that the personnel using their facilities do not waste utilities or energy.
  The responsibilities of the facility manager for the conservation of utilities are defined in Attachment
  4.
  3.13. Inform occupants that they are not to tamper with, replace, repair, or adjust electric equipment,
  including fuses and thermostats, heating and ventilation equipment such as radiators, registers, vents,
  and blowers.
  3.14. The facility manager should ensure that occupants do not alter the arrangements of, move or
  remove permanent water, lights, heat, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, and related fixtures or
  other real property installed equipment.
  3.15. When vacating a facility for disposal or other reasons, ensure that the facility is left in a clean
  and orderly condition. The facility manager duties are formally terminated when the property is com-
  pletely vacated by the using organization, accepted by the Real Estate officer as vacant, and all keys
  turned in.
  3.16. Prior to ordering any new equipment coordinate AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request, or
  AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn-in Request, through CSU. This must be done far enough in advance to
  allow the technicians opportunity to check the availability of and schedule utility connections/discon-
  nections. Too often equipment on order for several months is not brought to their attention until
  arrival and requires immediate installation. Without adequate notification, the material required to
  make utility connections will not be available and the occupants will be deprived of the equipment
  until the material is bought and work scheduled.
  3.17. Annually the facility manager will submit a facility self inspection checklist located in the Facil-
  ity Manager’s Handbook, A-6, along with submitting an annual recertification of personal data, A-7.
  The data will be used to ensure proper care and custody of the building is being accomplished. The
  personal data will be used to update the assigned facility manager list that is distributed to various
  agencies on base for after-hours emergency notifications.

                              MCCONNELL AFB RECYCLING PLAN

A3.1. McConnell AFB Recycling Plan: In order to improve participation in recycling and to reach the
Air Force goal of 40 percent solid waste diversion from landfill usage, a contractor has been retained to
collect, sort, and process recyclables from on base and in Military Family Housing (MFH). The contrac-
tor has established routes based on participating buildings and building locations. Recyclables from these
buildings are collected once a week, on the same day and in the same time frame weekly. Recycling col-
lection points are located in universally accessible locations and may consist of a can crusher unit, several
hanging bags, or a combination. Office and shop workers are provided personal recycling bins that they
are responsible for emptying into the central hanging bags. The contractor replaces the bags for the
offices on an exchange basis and takes the filled bags to the Recycling Center (Building 1090) for further
sorting and processing.

A3.2. Recyclables to be collected:The recyclables that are collected in the buildings and work centers
include: aluminum cans, tin can, paper, newspaper, and cardboard. These materials are collected in bags
that make them easy to transport during pickups and keep losses due to blowing wind to a minimum.
Additional recyclables may be added at a future date. Wooden pallets, glass, phone books, and compact
disks are also recycled; however those materials must be delivered to the recycling center. There are trail-
ers in the parking lot for the pallets and glass; compact disks and phone books may be delivered to the
recycling center contractor. Batteries from base operations may be taken to the Hazardous Waste Tempo-
rary Storage Facility (Building 1096). Empty aerosol cans may also be taken to Building 1096, however
work centers have Satellite Accumulation Points (SAPs) established for the collection of hazardous
waste.

A3.3. Facility organization: Facility managers are responsible for managing the recycling program at
their facility and should work closely with the Civil Engineer Environmental (CEV) office. The facility
manager is assigned the duty of ensuring that each office within the facility contributes to the base-recy-
cling program, and that their recycling bags are taken to the centralized pickup collection site. Also, this
individual shall ensure that daily inspections of the dumpsters for his/her facility are performed. The
CEV office will provide educational guidance and equipment support for each facility to maximize recy-
cling efforts.

A3.4. Recyclable collection routes. The following schedule identifies which buildings are picked up on
which day. For a more exact estimate concerning when a particular building will be picked up, call the
Recycling Center (x6626).
    A3.4.1. Monday: 314, 313, 352, 337, 338, 327, 408, 412, 810, 522, 806, 190, 850, 852, 340, 342, 350,
