1. General:
     1.1. The purpose of this instruction is to establish procedures to govern all vehicle operations
     on the airfield. Assign only trained personnel to duties that include driving on the airfield.
     Trained personnel must have the necessary knowledge base to comply with this instruction.
     The use of vehicles on the airfield is limited to the absolute minimum necessary to
     accomplish the mission. Safe operation of vehicles on the airfield is essential to normal
     aircraft operations and maintenance. Vehicles present a clear and definite danger to both
     aircraft and ground personnel. Carelessness, haste and a disregard for established safety
     standards are major factors in aircraft/vehicle collisions, incidents and personal injuries.
     Airfield drivers must be familiar with the provisions of this instruction and exercise their best
     judgment if they encounter situations not covered by published guidance.
     1.2. Unit commanders, unit Airfield Driving Program Managers (ADPM), and Airfield
     Management (AM) have the authority to revoke/suspend airfield driving privileges of any
     individual who fails or refuses to comply with the procedures established in this instruction
     or other applicable guidance.
     1.3. All personnel on the airfield are responsible for monitoring airfield safety, detecting
     unauthorized personnel/vehicles and immediately reporting airfield violations to Airfield
     Management Operations (AMOPS) and/or the Emergency Control Center (ECC). If
     necessary, ECC will dispatch a patrol to apprehend violators. AMOPS will determine
     appropriate action, to include suspension of airfield driving privileges and notification of the
     individual’s commander.
     1.4. Assigned personnel who requires operating a vehicle on the airfield must complete all
     training and testing requirements prior to operating a vehicle on the airfield. Prior airfield
     experience (e.g., operating vehicles or aircraft) is not a substitute for completion of the ADP
     training and testing requirements. Airfield vehicle operators require knowledge of the
     airfield environment (see Attachment 2, Mountain Home AFB Airfield Diagram).
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. The 366th Fighter Wing Commander (366 FW/CC) will:
        2.1.1. Designate personnel and agencies to support the ADP.
        2.1.2. Upon suspension/revocation of an individual’s base driving privileges, 366
        FW/CC may authorize (in writing) re-instatement of airfield driving privileges to perform
        critical mission essential duties.
     2.2. Unit Commanders will:
        2.2.1. Limit the number of personnel authorized to drive on the airfield to the minimum
        necessary to accomplish the mission. (Note: Annually validate the number of personnel
        authorized to drive on the airfield, to include justification for individuals requiring
        Controlled Movement Area (CMA) access, and forward results to DAFM.)
        2.2.2. Ensure unit training and testing requirements are completed IAW Air Force
        Instruction (AFI) 13-213 and this instruction for unit personnel authorized to drive on the
        airfield.

      3.1.1. All personnel operating a vehicle within the MHAFB airfield environment must
      receive Airfield Driver’s training IAW this instruction, and possess an AF Form 483
      endorsed for airfield driving (if not being escorted) and hold an appropriate
      civilian/military driver’s license to operate private/government/contractor-owned or
      leased vehicle.
      3.1.2. Sponsoring agencies (e.g., the 366th Communications Squadron (366 CS), the
      366th Contracting Squadron (366 CONS), the 366th Civil Engineering (366 CES), etc.)
      will provide qualified escorts for uncertified personnel working on the airfield. Personnel
      acting as escorts must be certified to drive on the airfield.
      3.1.3. Train temporary contractor and Temporary Duty (TDY) personnel IAW Chapter 6.
      3.1.4. Requirements for Permanent Change of Station (PCS), Permanent Change of
      Assignment (PCA), retirement, separation and license re-issue.
          3.1.4.1. Personnel who PCS, separate, or retire must turn in their AF Form 483 to
          their unit ADPM. ADPM will return the Airfield Driving Training and Certification
          Record (Attachment 6), Airfield Driving Qualification Training Checklist
          (Attachment 7) to the individual.
          3.1.4.2. When personnel PCA between units on base, the losing ADPM will ensure
          all airfield driving records (Attachments 5 and 6, CBT printout, etc.) are transferred to
          the gaining unit ADPM. The losing ADPM removes the individual from the unit’s
          list of airfield drivers. The gaining ADPM will verify currency of the individual’s
          training and add the individual to the list of qualified unit personnel.
   3.2. Lost Documentation:
      3.2.1. Personnel who lose their AF Form 483 can be reissued a new one by hand carrying
      the original Airfield Driving Training and Certification Record (Attachment 6), Airfield
      Driving Qualification Training Checklist (Attachment 7), and a current copy of the AF
      Airfield Driving CBT certificate to AMOPS. AMOPS will verify training/testing
      documentation and issue a new AF Form 483.
      3.2.2. Personnel who lose their Airfield Driving Training and Certification Record
      (Attachment 6) and Airfield Driving Qualification Training Checklist (Attachment 7),
      and still have a valid AF Form 483 for MHAFB may be recertified to drive on airfield by
      the unit ADPM. The ADPM will complete new forms with a current copy of the AF
      Airfield Driving CBT certificate. ADPM will make a statement on the form to indicate it
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI13-213 24 AUGUST 2011                                                       11

        3.3.3.1. In cases where an individual fails the color vision tests, unit commanders
        may request a waiver to color vision requirements for mission necessity. Forward
        written waiver requests to DAFM, along with the results of the color vision test from
        Optometry.
        3.3.3.2. DAFM will coordinate requests with the unit ADPM and AFM to evaluate
        those cases to determine if issuance of a "limited/no CMA Access" AF Form 483 is
        warranted. Annotate restrictions on the MHAFB Airfield Driving Training and
        Certification Record and AF Form 483. Note: Waivers to color vision requirements
        can only be approved for non-controlled movement areas (e.g., parking apron).

MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI13-213 24 AUGUST 2011                                                       19


Figure 4.1. AFVA 13-222, Runway/Controlled Movement Area Procedures.




            4.3.1.1.1. The Control Tower has authority over all traffic entering the CMA, and
            will issue specific instructions to control movement of aircraft, vehicles,
            equipment or personnel.
            4.3.1.1.2. Establish radio contact with the Control Tower before gaining access to
            crossing or working in the CMA. Once the Control Tower approves access,
            maintain radio contact while in the CMA. Note: Control Tower will not issue or
            use unconditional instructions (blanket approval) when authorizing vehicles to
            enter the runway.
            4.3.1.1.3. Vehicles operating within the CMA will use call signs approved by
            AM. All units will provide AM with a list of radio call signs to be used within the
            CMA to avoid duplication (refer to Attachment 8, Unit Radio Call Signs).
            4.3.1.1.4. Vehicles operating within the CMA will have an AFVA 13-222
            (Figure 4.1) in the vehicle at all times. The decal may be permanently affixed in
            plain view of the driver, or clipped to the inside of the sun visor on the driver’s
            side of the vehicle and flipped down for ready reference.
            4.3.1.1.5. Vehicles will use a Light Emitting Diode (LED)/rotating beacon or
            emergency warning flashers while operating in the CMA.
            4.3.1.1.6. Vehicles operating in the CMA on a daily basis should have a
            permanent radio mounted in the vehicle to communicate with the Control Tower.
            Use a handheld radio only as a backup or when communication is required
            outside the vehicle. Note: Conduct an operational test of the radio before
20                                      MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI13-213 24 AUGUST 2011


            entering the airfield.
     4.3.1.1.7. Words that authorize access to CMA are ―PROCEED‖ and ―CROSS.‖ The
     word ―HOLD‖ indicates disapproval of an operator’s request. Drivers will never use
     “CLEAR.‖ The proper term for leaving the CMA is ―OUT OF‖ and ―OFF‖ for exiting
     the runway (refer to paragraph 3.9.5.5 for examples).
     4.3.1.1.8. The Control Tower is manned Monday-Thursday 0700L-0000L.                  Fridays:
     0700L-1800L. Closed Saturday and Sunday.
     4.3.1.1.9. During the times the Control Tower is closed and AM is open, AM will have
     control of CMA access. Radio contact with AM must be established before gaining
     access to the CMA. Radio contact will be maintained at all times while in CMA.
     4.3.1.1.10. During the times the Control Tower and AM is closed, 366 FW/CP is the
     monitoring agency for the CMA. Agencies will utilize two-way radio contact as the only
     means of communications. Agencies will advise 366 FW/CP when entering and exiting
     the runway.
     Additionally, agencies will maintain two-way radio contact with 366 FW/CP personnel
     while on the runway in the event an unscheduled emergency landing requires clearing of
     the runway. Note: 366 FW/CP is only a monitoring agency and is not liable for vehicles
     on the airfield.
  4.4. Disabled Vehicles/Radio Failure:
     4.4.1. When a vehicle has a malfunction that prevents operation under its own power,
     use every means to alert taxiing aircraft in the vicinity. At a minimum, the ground
     vehicle operator will:
     4.4.2. Switch the vehicle parking lights or emergency flashers on.
     4.4.3. If the vehicle has two-way radio capability, make the following transmission: “All
     parties BREAK, BREAK-This is (call sign) with an emergency for Airfield Management,
     Tower, and Maintenance Operations Center.” State the nature of the problem and report
     your position on the airfield.
     4.4.4. Operators of other radio-equipped vehicles (e.g., security forces, civil engineering,
     transportation, etc.) shall make every effort to assist the disabled vehicle off the airfield,
     especially if the vehicle is located on parking aprons, taxiways or runway.
     4.4.5. If a vehicle is not equipped with a two-way radio, stay with the vehicle and
     continue attempts to alert taxiing aircraft or other vehicles in the vicinity.
     4.4.6. In the event of a disabled vehicle on the CMA, vehicle operator will immediately
     notify the Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and AM by any means, to coordinate its
     removal.
        4.4.6.1. When radio communications cannot be established between vehicle
        operators in the CMA and the Control Tower, Control Tower will use light-gun
        signals to communicate.
        4.4.6.2. If light-gun signals fail, Control Tower will raise and lower the intensity of
        the runway lights as an emergency runway exit signal.
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI13-213 24 AUGUST 2011                                                      21


      4.4.7. Vehicle operator will ensure the disabled vehicle is not left unattended in the
      CMA.
      4.4.8. Remove the disabled vehicle using the quickest and safest way possible.
   4.5. Restricted Areas and Entry Control Points:
      4.5.1. Restricted areas are identified by a red line. The main parking apron north of
      Taxiway Alpha is a restricted area. This area is accessible by ECPs located along
      flightline road. Mark operational ECPs with either barrels are cones (refer to Figure
      4.2). Restricted area access is IAW the local installation defense plan (IDP). Note: You
      must have a restricted area badge (RAB) with the appropriate authorization (or be under
      escort) to enter the restricted area.

Figure 4.2. Entry Control Point.




      4.5.2. There are four restricted areas on the airfield: Parking rows 1-2, 3-5, Heavy
      Ramp, rows 6-11, Transient Ramp, rows 12-23, and Charlie and Delta Live Ordnance
      Loading Areas (LOLA). (Note: LOLAs only become a restricted area when an aircraft
      is present.)
      4.5.3. Ensure FOD checks are performed prior to entering a restricted area.
      4.5.4. Controlled Areas are identified by AFVA 31-204, Controlled Area Signs, posted
      on controlled area boundaries, and at personnel entry points. These signs/markings
      mirror the airfield boundaries.
          4.5.4.1. The entire airfield is designated as a controlled area. Only personnel
          designated by the unit commander have access into controlled areas.
          4.5.4.2. The designation ―Controlled Area‖ carries the same legal and moral
          restrictions as a physical barrier.
   4.6. Vehicle Parking and Chocking:
      4.6.1. Parked Vehicles. Vehicles parked and left unattended on the airfield will:
          4.6.1.1. Turn the ignition off. Keys will remain in the ignition when vehicles are
          parked in an aircraft movement area.

         aircraft parking ramp shall be parallel to the noses of the parked aircraft with the
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI13-213 24 AUGUST 2011                                                             25


          driver’s side toward the nearest aircraft. Do not drive diagonally across the parking
          ramp, but at 90-degree angle to the vehicle lanes.
   4.13. Traffic Lane Procedures (see Figure 4.3):
      4.13.1. Traffic lanes are identified by solid white lines and are parallel to the parking
      rows. Vehicles within a traffic lane will drive in one direction and with the driver’s side
      towards the aircraft. Operate vehicles in a single-file on traffic lanes at all times unless in
      direct support of an aircraft or responding to an emergency.
          4.13.1.1. The centerline areas of the taxiway or taxilanes are reserved as safety lanes
          and kept clear of vehicles and equipment. (Note: Under normal circumstances, the
          only vehicles authorized to operate on the centerline of a taxiway include, but are not
          limited to, Airfield Management vehicles, Flight Safety vehicles, airfield sweepers
          and vehicles towing aircraft.)

Figure 4.3. Traffic Lane.




          4.13.1.2. Vehicle/Aircraft Right-of-Way Procedures:
          4.13.1.3. When approaching or being approached by taxiing aircraft, exit taxiway or
          move from aircraft path at next paved surface (time permitting) until the aircraft is
          well clear of your vehicle. If it is necessary to drive off the paved surface, the
          operator is responsible for checking the vehicle tires for FOD material and ensuring
          all tires and paved surface are clear of FOD. Accomplish this check immediately
          upon returning to the paved surface.
          4.13.1.4. Do not drive on taxiway shoulders unless yielding to taxiing aircraft or
          aircraft in towing. (Note: 366 FW/CC may authorize driving on the shoulders for
          specific periods of time such as local wing exercises.)
          4.13.1.5. Do not cross in front of an aircraft when an approaching aircraft is within
          500 feet of your position, or until the aircraft has passed your position by at least 200
          feet (small/medium frame aircraft) or 300 feet (large frame aircraft).
          4.13.1.6. Vehicles will not cross in front of an aircraft on hold unless signaled to do
          so by the pilot or instructed by the Control Tower via radio. Vehicle operators will
          never proceed between aircraft and personnel marshalling aircraft.
   4.14. Towing Operations:
      4.14.1. Prior to towing operations, operators will contact the Control Tower for approval.
26                                      MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI13-213 24 AUGUST 2011


     4.14.2. Towing speeds are outlined in paragraph 4.8.
  4.15. Emergency Vehicle Operations:
     4.15.1. Vehicle operators will immediately yield the right-of-way to emergency and
     fire/crash vehicles with rotating emergency lights in operation. Remain clear of runway
     or taxiway access points until the emergency is terminated.
     4.15.2. Each emergency response vehicle is required to request permission into the CMA
     via the Control Tower. It must not be assumed that CMA access is allowed without
     specific permission from the Control Tower. (Note: The Fire Chief (Chief 1, Chief 2,
     etc.) is allowed to request permission into the CMA for additional crash vehicles.)
     4.15.3. Follow-on/support response agencies are required to standby on the airfield side
     of building 210 until called forward by the Fire Chief or incident commander.
  4.16. Aerospace Ground Equipment Operations:
     4.16.1. Remove AGE equipment, electrical carts, forklifts, tow bars, fire extinguishers,
     maintenance stands, portable lighting and similar equipment (when not in use) from the
     aircraft parking area and store in appropriate areas IAW Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC)
     3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design. Designated AGE/support
     equipment storage is established within a reasonable distance near every ramp. (Note:
     Specifically identified equipment may be placed in authorized locations, provided they
     are marked with standardized markings to ensure proper placement.) Waivers are
     required prior to placement of these equipment items.
     4.16.2. Do not place equipment earlier than 3 hours prior to aircraft arrival, and no
     longer than 3 hours after aircraft departure IAW UFC 3-260-01. However, equipment
     should be removed as soon as it is no longer required.
     4.16.3. At the end of aircraft parking rows, maintain AGE and support equipment within
     the equipment lines to ensure at least 10 feet of wingtip clearance for taxiing aircraft.
  4.17. Restricted Visibility and Night Operations:
     4.17.1. In order to preserve aircrew night vision, during periods of darkness or reduced
     visibility, do not direct headlights towards the cockpit of an aircraft. Use parking lights
     to identify vehicle positions.
     4.17.2. Vehicles parked on the airfield during hours of darkness or reduced visibility will
     use emergency flashers (hazard lights). Exception: Specialized equipment (i.e., bomb
     loaders) not equipped with emergency warning flashers will be equipped with reflective
     markings during hours of darkness and inclement weather.
     4.17.3. Top-mounted rotating emergency lights must be in operation for vehicles
     routinely operating in the CMA. Emergency vehicles not operating in the CMA may be
     equipped with dash or grill mounted emergency lights. When emergency lighting
     devices are not available, use emergency flashers (hazard lights) when operating in the
     CMA.
     4.17.4. Golf carts/electric cars not equipped with parking lights are exempt from turning
     headlights off. However, golf carts/electric car operators should position their vehicles to
     prevent headlights from shining towards moving aircraft.
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI13-213 24 AUGUST 2011                                                        27


   4.18. Daytime Running Lights (DRL). Vehicles equipped with daytime running lights will
   not shine headlights directly towards aircraft during darkness/reduced visibility operations.
   Reposition vehicle until the aircraft is out of range. If not possible, operators will
   immediately turn off the ignition and turn on emergency flashers to identify position.
   Headlights will remain off until the aircraft is out of range.
   4.19. Control Tower Light Gun Signals:
      4.19.1. Vehicle operators will be familiar/comply with airfield signs, markings and
      Control Tower light gun signals.
      4.19.2. All vehicles operating on airfield will have an AFVA 11-240 decal (see Figure
      4.4). Permanently affix the decal in plain view of driver or clipped to the inside of the
      driver’s side sun visor so it can be flipped down for ready reference.

      4.20.2. Runway Lights. White and amber lights are located on the edges of runways.
      These high intensity lights run the length of runway and identifies runway edge.

Figure 4.6. Runway Lights.




      4.20.3. Visual Flight Rules Hold Position Markings. VFR hold positions are located
      at least 100 feet from the edge of runways on all taxiways leading to the runway. The
      markings consist of four parallel yellow stripes perpendicular to the axis of taxiway
      centerline, extending across the taxiway, including the shoulders (Figure 4.7). The two
      stripes closest to the runway are dashed lines and the other two are solid lines. These
      lines mark the CMA boundary. Vehicles will not cross runway hold positions or proceed
      onto the runway without obtaining permission from the Control Tower.
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI13-213 24 AUGUST 2011                                                           29


Figure 4.7. VFR Hold Position Markings.




      4.20.4. Wing Tip Lines. The outer-most white solid line across the main parking ramp
      identifies the minimum distance vehicles and equipment can be positioned to facilitate
      safe passage of towed or taxiing aircraft on Taxiway Alpha (see Figure 4.8).

Figure 4.8. Wing Tip Lines.




      4.20.5. Closed Pavement Markings. Airfield pavements previously used for aircraft
      operations that are currently closed to aircraft traffic are marked with a yellow 30-foot
      long capital X. Vehicles may still use these paved areas, but will conduct FOD checks
      prior to reentering operational airfield pavements due to pavement degradation on some
      of these areas.

Figure 4.9. Closed Pavement Markings.




      4.20.6. Traffic Lane Markings. Some areas of the airfield have vehicle lanes marked
      with white lines (Figure 4.3). Airfield access roads, roads within the airfield interior, and
      barrier access roads leading to the runway all have white stop-bar markings (Figure
      4.10). The stopping distances ensure taxiways have required wing tip clearance. Stop-
      bars on barrier access roads are in line with CMA hold position markings.

          parts.
      4.22.2. Remove FOD from the vehicle undercarriage, tires, wheel wells and truck beds.
      4.22.3. Vehicle operators must make every attempt to stay on paved surfaces and avoid
      driving on unimproved surfaces (e.g., dirt or grass). If driving on unimproved surfaces is
      required, conduct a FOD check upon exit of these areas or returning to paved surfaces.
      4.22.4. During winter conditions, snow and icy conditions may cause accumulation on
      vehicles. Anytime these conditions are present, FOD checks are mandatory, to include
      removal of snow and ice from vehicle tops, bumpers and wheel wells.

environment. Found at the point where a taxiway and runway intersect. Hold lines are painted
lines 100 feet from the runway edge. A vehicle may not cross these lines onto a runway without
clearance from the Control Tower. The marking consists of two solid yellow lines (on the side

where the vehicle is to wait,) and two dashed yellow lines spaced six inches apart, spanning the
width of the taxiway (including shoulders).
Runway Incursion— Any occurrence at an aerodrome involving the incorrect presence of an
aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-
off of aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, the protected area is the same as the CMA.

Operational Error (OE)— A failure of the air traffic control system that results in loss of
separation.
Pilot Deviation (PD)— The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC instructions,
AFIs and/or FARs.
Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation(V/PD)— Any entry or movement on the controlled movement
area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been
authorized by Air Traffic Control.
Say Again— Used to request a repeat of the last transmission. Usually specifies transmission
was not understood or received.
Stand By— To pause while other duties of a higher priority are attended to. Also means to
standby for clearance/approval.
Service Roads— Service roads provide connections to parking ramps, aprons, servicing areas,
Control Tower, and hangars.
Special Purpose Vehicles— Vehicles designed and used for a specific purpose in the course of
aircraft servicing and maintenance. Forklifts, tugs, bobcats, multi-purpose servicing units, bomb
lifts, etc., are included.
Taxilane— Ramp space between rows of parked aircraft used to maneuver aircraft to and from
parking spots and taxiways.
Taxiways— A paved surface for taxiing aircraft from parking ramp to runway. Taxiways on
Mountain Home AFB are designated Taxiway Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, Foxtrot, and
Hotel.
Unit— For the purpose of this ADI, the term unit is equivalent to a Squadron, also known as the
basic unit in the USAF organizational structure. Squadrons are usually made up of several
flights (typically four), and commanded by a field grade officer.
Vehicle/Pedestrian Deviation (V/PD)— An entry or movement on the controlled movement
area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrians not authorized by Air
Traffic Control.
