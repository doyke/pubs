                   GENERAL CONCEPTS, POLICIES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

                                                Chapter 1

   INTRODUCTION TO AIR FORCE OPERATIONAL REPORTING SYSTEM (AFOREPS)

1.1. Concept of the AFOREPS. The set of reports that make up the AFOREPS provide HQ USAF and
intermediate commands the information necessary for timely operational decisions. Major commands
(MAJCOM) will integrate their reporting systems into AFOREPS, thereby allowing easy lateral and ver-
tical transfer of information.

1.2. Reporting Instructions and Principles. The following instructions and principles apply to the
AFOREPS:
   1.2.1. AFOREPS reports draw information from numerous sources (e.g., personnel, materiel, equip-
   ment status, operations and logistics planning, situation monitoring, and intelligence) and give deci-
   sion makers a concise picture of events. The main criterion for inclusion in the AFOREPS system is
   essential information for command and control of aerospace forces.
   1.2.2. Commands with both an Air Force and a joint or combined reporting requirement (e.g., air
   component commands) will use the AFOREPS and address both chains.
   1.2.3. Annually, MAJCOMs will review new requirements to determine operational necessity.

1.3. Command Reporting Responsibilities. To identify and streamline host-tenant responsibilities, host
units will establish host-tenant agreements that meet the needs of both organizations. Commanders are
responsible for timely and accurate reporting for all events/incidents that meet CJCS reporting criteria
(PINNACLEs), CSAF reporting criteria (BEELINEs), and MAJCOM/CC reporting criteria (HOME-
LINEs) for all assigned or attached units, as well as units staging through their command. The agreement
will establish procedures to ensure the installation commander is made aware of all events/incidents
occurring on or affecting their installation. Agreements must adhere to the following stipulations at a min-
imum.
1.3. (AFRC) Command Reporting Responsibilities. AFRC wing and associate unit commanders will
ensure immediate submission of OPREP-3 reports for all significant events/incidents, actual or probable,
of a military or political nature which involve or may involve any AFRC activity or personnel. All units
will voice notify the AFRC command center when they become aware of an incident involving their
resources where the OPREP is not submitted by an AFRC unit. Where a host command post submits the
report, AFRC tenant units will ensure the host includes the appropriate addressees IAW AFI 10-206 as
supplemented.
   1.3.1. Ensure established procedures do not delay the submission of OPREP-3 reports.
   1.3.2. Outline specific OPREP-3 responsibilities of host and tenant command posts/units, i.e., 1C3s
   functioning as a command post entity such as AMCCs, (including who will submit the reports), with
   emphasis on timely and accurate report submission.
   1.3.2. (AFRC) Where the host-tenant agreement or Memorandum of Agreement specifies that tenant
   reporting will be done through the host command post, AFRC tenant units will identify AFRC-unique
8                                                      AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006


    operational reporting requirements to the host in that agreement. AFRC units will also ensure the host
    has current contact numbers and DMS addresses for both the AFRC tenant unit and AFRC Command
    Center.
    1.3.3. Installations Operating Under a Single MAJCOM: If the installation has one or more ten-
    ant(s) but only one command post, the host unit will establish the agreement, and the command post
    will submit all OPREP-3 reports. The commander or authorized delegate operating the command post
    submitting the report will approve OPREP-3 reports prior to submission.
    1.3.4. Installations Operating with Multiple MAJCOMs: Tenant commanders assigned to a dif-
    ferent MAJCOM than the host unit, have the sole responsibility to report an event/incident affecting
    their assets that meet OPREP-3 reporting criteria. The unit commander or authorized delegate submit-
    ting the report will have approval/release authority for all OPREP-3 reports affecting his/her assets.
       1.3.4.1. If the host command post submits OPREP-3 reports for the tenant, the host unit will not
       interfere with, alter, or delay the tenant unit’s report.
    1.3.5. Ensure OPREP-3 reports have all required addresses, including the affected (host or tenant)
    MAJCOM command center, and affected units and MAJCOMs.
    1.3.6. Provide copies of the agreement to the host and tenant MAJCOMs, IAW MAJCOM proce-
    dures. MAJCOMs will maintain a current copy of the agreement on file.
    1.3.7. MAJCOMs, direct reporting units (DRUs), field operating agencies (FOAs), Air Force Reserve
    (AFRC), and Air National Guard (ANG) personnel will develop instructions to ensure timely and
    accurate OPREP-3 reporting.
    1.3.7. (AFRC) Aircrews whose aircraft is under operational control (OPCON) of AFRC will report
    through AFRC channels. Aircrews whose aircraft has changed operational control (“chopped”) to
    another command will comply with the reporting requirements of that command but will ensure HQ
    AFRC Command Center is an information addressee on all OPREPS involving AFRC resources.
       1.3.7.1. Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) that do not fit under any of the above criteria
       will comply with parent MAJCOM guidance IAW this instruction.
    1.3.8. Air component commanders of unified commands and/or JTFs will ensure compliance through
    their air component command centers and de-conflict with unified/JTF command directives.

1.4. Authority and References:
    1.4.1. Authority. This instruction includes the requirements of the various documents of the Joint
    Reporting System. Air Force units will use AFI 10-206 as the primary source for reporting instruc-
    tions. Later chapters identify reference materials for specific reports.
    1.4.2. Emergency Status Codes (ESC). These codes serve as a guide for reporting under emergency
    and crisis conditions. Each chapter reflects the ESC required for each type report. AFI 33-324, The
    Information Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Inter-
    agency Air Force Information Collections (formerly AFI 37-124) prescribes ESC.
       1.4.2.1. Status Code “D” indicates: Immediately discontinue reporting data requirements during
       emergency conditions.
AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006                                                                  9


     1.4.2.2. Status Code “C1” indicates: Continue reporting during emergency conditions, priority
     precedence. Submit data requirements assigned this category as prescribed or by any means to
     ensure arrival on the established due dates.
     1.4.2.3. Status Code “C2” indicates: Continue reporting during emergency conditions, normal
     priority. Submit data requirements in this category as prescribed or by any means to ensure arrival
     on the established due dates.
     1.4.2.4. Status Code “C3” indicates: Continue reporting during emergency conditions, delayed
     precedence. Submit data requirements as prescribed, but they may be delayed to allow the submis-
     sion of higher precedence reports. Submit by non-electronic means, if possible.
  1.4.3. Chapter 5 of this instruction is exempt from report licensing as defined in AFI 33-324. The
  HQ USAF Report Control Symbol (RCS) follows the title of each type report.
  1.4.4. (Added-AFRC) Requests for clarification of operational reporting requirements should be
  e-mailed to HQ AFRC DOCR.

                             GENERAL REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS

2.1. Security Classification and Downgrading Instructions. AFI 31-401, Information Security Pro-
gram Management provides security classification and downgrading instructions.
     2.1.1. Classify reports indicating unit combat readiness status according to AFI 10-201, Status of
     Resources and Training System (SORTS).
     2.1.2. Classify OPREP-3 reports containing:
        2.1.2.1. Information on a combat loss or damage or discussing combat mission results a minimum
        of SECRET.
        2.1.2.2. A complete inventory of nuclear weapons of one or more units a minimum of SECRET.
        2.1.2.3. Information on the deployment of combat aircraft, units, or personnel according to the
        appropriate deployment plans.
        2.1.2.4. Unit names and locations associated with a plan according to security instructions.
        2.1.2.5. Events/incidents involving nuclear weapons according to content.
        2.1.2.6. Events/incidents of confirmed or suspected compromise of classified information accord-
        ing to content.
        2.1.2.7. Information of a unit’s total mission impairment according to content.

2.2. Transmitting Reports During Combat or Combat Related Operations. When combat or com-
bat-related operational requirements make speed of delivery paramount, military commanders may mod-
ify transmission of classified information as necessary to meet local conditions. (When so doing,
commanders will cite in the message "CJCSM 3150.03B, Enclosure A, paragraph 4a," as the authority.)

2.3. Flagword JOPREP JIFFY. The flagword JOPREP JIFFY identifies electrically transmitted com-
mand post-to-command post messages and operational reports, and notifies communications centers to
route a message directly to the command and control facility. The flagword does not indicate a precedence
for transmission within communications channels.

2.4. Operating in a Degraded Communications Environment. HQ USAF and MAJCOMs may sus-
pend the submission of selected reports. MAJCOMs will advise HQ USAF immediately of any suspended
AFOREPS reports.

2.5. Report Formats. Prepare record copy reports using the specific formats and content information
available in AFPAM 10-709 V1CD (formerly AFP 102-2, volume I), and as supplemented by this instruc-
tion. When AFPAM 10-709 V1CD, does not contain a specific format for the record copy report, use the
General Administration (GENADMIN) format with the report's name as the SUBJECT.

2.6. Correction of Reports. The originator will submit a correction if an error is noticed after submitting
a report. The corrected report includes only those sections of the report requiring correction. The cor-
AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006                                                                    11


rected report will be classified according to its content. Identify a corrected report by placing "CORR" in
the third field of the TIMELOC set.

                EVENT/INCIDENT REPORT (OPREP-3)(RCS: HAF-XOO(AR)7118)

3.1. Subject and Purpose. OPREP-3 reports use command post channels to immediately notify com-
manders of any significant event or incident that rises to the level of MAJCOM, HQ USAF, or DOD inter-
ests. Submit the applicable OPREP-3 regardless of whether or not the event is being reported through
other channels. OPREP-3 reports do not replace the requirement for more detailed reports such as the Air-
crew/Aircraft Loss Report (LOSREP), the Commander's Situation Report (SITREP), and accident or inci-
dent investigation reports. Submitting an OPREP-3 report neither changes, nor substitutes for any report
required by other directives.
     3.1.1. (Added-AFRC) This supplement identifies events/incidents/circumstances which AFRC
     senior leaders have determined to be reportable to the headquarters via the AFRC Command Center.
     Because the OPREP-3 may be the first indication of events or incidents requiring immediate
     responses or actions by AFRC senior leadership, the necessity for promptly submitting these reports
     cannot be overemphasized. Therefore, the guideline for commanders when determining whether or
     not to report an event or incident is “report it!” Contact the AFRC Command Center for assistance
     whenever a situation arises that does not clearly fit the reporting criteria.

3.2. Reference Materials. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Manual (CJCSM) 3150.03B.

3.3. Report Categories. OPREP-3 reports categorize events or incidents according to their nature. Flag-
words associated with each category aid prompt transmission, processing, and distribution of the reports
by alerting people to their importance. The following flagword reports make up the OPREP-3 system.
     3.3.1. PINNACLE (OPREP-3P). This message is used by any unit to provide the NMCC and, as
     appropriate, combatant commands and Services with immediate notification of any incident or event
     where national-level interest is indicated. The general OPREP-3P report is used for situations that do
     not require reporting via other OPREP-3P reports listed in subparagraphs 3.3.2. through 3.3.9. this
     report is not restricted to operational information. Any event or incident should be considered report-
     able if it:
        3.3.1.1. Generates a higher level of military action.
        3.3.1.2. Causes a national reaction.
        3.3.1.3. Affects international relationships.
        3.3.1.4. Causes immediate widespread coverage in news media.
        3.3.1.5. Is clearly against the national interest.
        3.3.1.6. Affects current national policy.
     3.3.2. PINNACLE NUCFLASH (OPREP-3PNF). Used to report an event, accident, or incident
     that could create the risk of a nuclear war. This message has the highest precedence in the OPREP-3
     reporting structure. Report any of the following as an OPREP-3PNF:
AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006                                                                13


     3.3.2.1. Ballistic missile launch or space launch.
     3.3.2.2. Reentering space object.
     3.3.2.3. Loss, potential loss or degradation of US military space capability when the loss or deg-
     radation is because of actions by a suspected or known hostile source.
     3.3.2.4. Reports of cruise missiles or non-friendly, non-US or non-allied aircraft not on an
     approved flight plan that could pose a threat.
         3.3.2.4.1. Accidental, unauthorized, or unexplained incident involving possible detonation of
         a nuclear weapon.
         3.3.2.4.2. Unauthorized flight or deviation from an approved flight plan, by a US
         nuclear-armed or nuclear-capable aircraft with the capability to penetrate the airspace of
         another nuclear-capable country.
  3.3.3. PINNACLE FRONT BURNER (OPREP-3PFB). Used to report pre-conflict occurrence of
  armed attack, harassment, or hostile action against US forces, territory, or interests.
  3.3.4. PINNACLE BROKEN ARROW (OPREP-3PBA). Used to report a US nuclear weapon
  accident that does not create the risk of a nuclear war. Included are the following:
     3.3.4.1. Nuclear detonation of a US nuclear weapon.
     3.3.4.2. Non-nuclear detonation or burning of a nuclear weapon.
     3.3.4.3. Radioactive contamination from a US nuclear weapon or component.
     3.3.4.4. The jettisoning of a US nuclear weapon or component.
     3.3.4.5. Public hazard, actual or implied, from a US nuclear weapon or component.
  3.3.5. PINNACLE EMPTY QUIVER (OPREP-3PEQ). Used to report the seizure, theft, or loss of
  a nuclear weapon.
  3.3.6. PINNACLE EMERGENCY DISABLEMENT (OPREP-3PED). Used for reporting opera-
  tions involving the command disablement or nonviolent disablement of nuclear weapons.
  3.3.7. PINNACLE EMERGENCY EVACUATION (OPREP-3PEV). Used to report operations

  3.3.9. PINNACLE LERTCON STATUS OF ACTION (OPREP-3PLSOA). Used to immediately
  notify the NMCC of Combatant Commander’s actions relative to the alert condition of their forces.
  3.3.10. BENT SPEAR (OPREP-3BS). Used to report incidents involving nuclear weapons that are of
  significant interest but are not categorized as PINNACLE NUCFLASH or PINNACLE BROKEN
  ARROW to the appropriate Service headquarters. The flagword PINNACLE may be added at any
  level of command to expedite forwarding of this message to the NMCC.
  3.3.11. FADED GIANT (OPREP-3FG). Used to report nuclear reactor or radiological accidents or
  incidents to the appropriate Service headquarters. The flagword PINNACLE may be added at any
  level of command to expedite forwarding of this message to the NMCC
14                                                       AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006


     3.3.12. BEELINE (OPREP-3B). Used to report any event or incident that requires Air Force-level
     interest, but not requiring OPREP-3 PINNACLE reports. Although the report normally remains
     within US Air Force channels, commanders may add other addressees, as appropriate to avoid dupli-
     cate reporting. HQ USAF may make BEELINE information available to agencies outside the Air
     Force (e.g., NMCC, State Department) based on the situation.
        3.3.12.1. (Added-AFRC) Fuel Spill (See Table 3.4., Rule 2K). Include HQ AFRC/CEV as an
        information addressee on all incidents involving release of POL. Attachment 10 (Added) lists
        information to include in OPREPs involving spills or releases.
        3.3.12.2. (Added-AFRC) Off-DZ Airdrop Incident Reporting. (See Table 3.4., Rule 1L) An
        Off-DZ Airdrop incident is an OPREP-3 HOMELINE (OPREP-3H) reportable incident when the
        criteria contained in AFI 10-206 are not met.
            3.3.12.2.1. (Added-AFRC) Attachment 2 (Added) contains specific reporting requirements
            for Off-DZ Airdrops. Units without airdrop expertise may contact HQ AFRC/DOOM through
            the AFRC Command Center for clarification on items listed in Attachment 2 (Added).
            3.3.12.2.2. (Added-AFRC) Timely collection and reporting of the facts (prior to the crew
            entering rest, if possible) is critical. Although additional investigation of Off-DZ Airdrop inci-
            dents may be necessary to determine all the facts, do not delay initial reporting to obtain
            details; they can be sent in supplemental reports.
        3.3.12.3. (Added-AFRC) Hurricane Evacuation (HURREVAC). (See Table 3.4., Rule 1D) A
        minimum of three OPREP-3 BEELINE reports are required for aircraft evacuation. When report-
        ing aircraft evacuation information via OPREP-3 BEELINE, begin with the decision to evacuate
        and continue through return to home station. Submit changes as updates occur. Do not submit a
        final report until all aircraft have returned to home station. Reports must be sent:
            3.3.12.3.1. (Added-AFRC) When a hurricane/typhoon condition is declared.
            3.3.12.3.2. (Added-AFRC) When the evacuation stage is set (planned or actual). Report air-
            craft disposition plan for all assigned and transient aircraft, e.g., deployed, evacuated, han-
            gared, tied down, or in depot maintenance. Include refuge base(s), ETD of first and last
            evacuating aircraft, ETA at refuge base(s) of first and last evacuating aircraft.
            3.3.12.3.3. (Added-AFRC) Upon return to home base.
            3.3.12.3.4. (Added-AFRC) Units contact AFRC Air Operations Branch (DOOM) through
            the AFRC Command Center for HURREVAC airlift support requests. AFRC Command Cen-
            ter and HQ AFRC/DOOM can provide airlift redeployment assistance to AFRC flying units
            when requested. Use the guidance provided in the basic reporting manual to indicate what type
            support is needed.
     3.3.13. HOMELINE (OPREP-3H). Used to report events or incidents, which do not meet Air
     Force-level criteria, but are of interest to the MAJCOM. Although these reports are not addressed to
     HQ Air Force, they are part of the AFOREPS program and will use the same basic format. MAJCOMs
     determine specific reporting requirements and procedures for the HOMELINE report.
     ANG units report HOMELINE-level information to ANG Operations Center, unless federalized or
     mobilized.
AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006                                                                 15


  3.3.13. (AFRC) HOMELINE (OPREP-3H). Air Force Reserve Command OPREP-3 HOMELINE
  report requirements appear below. Events and incidents are HOMELINE reportable if they meet the
  criteria listed in Attachment 4 (Added), or if the commander determines they should be reported to
  HQ AFRC.
     3.3.13.1. (Added-AFRC) Subject and Purpose. Provides specific reporting instructions, report
     content, and sample reports for the OPREP-3 HOMELINE.
     3.3.13.2. (Added-AFRC) Use the flagword HOMELINE to identify events or incidents of inter-
     est only to HQ AFRC.
     3.3.13.3. (Added-AFRC) The HOMELINE report is submitted through, and normally remains
     within, Air Force Reserve Command channels; however, other addressees outside AFRC channels
     may be added as appropriate.
     3.3.13.4. (Added-AFRC) Reporting an incident that seemed significant at the time, but later is
     deemed insignificant, will not be criticized. When a reported event/incident is subsequently deter-
     mined not to have been OPREP-3 reportable, the reporting units will notify all previous address-
     ees that the event/incident has been determined not to meet OPREP-3 reporting criteria.
     3.3.13.5. (Added-AFRC) Submit HOMELINE reports to the AFRC Command Center (HQ
     AFRC/DOCC). Initiate HOMELINE reports as soon as the event or incident becomes known. Do
     not delay the report to gain additional information.
     3.3.13.6. (Added-AFRC) Precedence. Use IMMEDIATE precedence for voice and record
     reports; however, FLASH may be used if the situation warrants. Submit HOMELINEs by the most
     rapid means available which provides the necessary security protection. DMS is the primary
     means of submitting record copy OPREP reports. Normal e-mail is the backup means. If a unit’s
     DMS and e-mail are non-operational, units should notify the AFRC Command Center for further
     guidance concerning record copy submission.
     3.3.13.7. (Added-AFRC) OPREP-3 HOMELINE reports must contain a rule reference number
     from the OPREP-3 HOMELINE Matrix (example: “ HOMELINE Rule Number 1D used” or
     “HOMELINE Rule Number 14L used”).
     3.3.13.8. (Added-AFRC) Submit voice reports to:
         3.3.13.8.1. (Added-AFRC) AFRC Command Center, DSN 497-0680, commercial (478)
         327-0680, or Toll Free 1-800-223-1784, extension 7-0680. The AFRC Command Center will
         initiate the voice report to the gaining MAJCOM (as appropriate). Units reporting through
         NORAD channels will ensure the AFRC Command Center is included in the conference.
         3.3.13.8.2. (Added-AFRC) Wing and NAF (as applicable).
     3.3.13.9. (Added-AFRC) Submit record reports to:
         3.3.13.9.1. (Added-AFRC) Action: AFRC/Command Center (uc).
         3.3.13.9.2. (Added-AFRC) Info: NAF/DO/DOOC/CP, Parent Wing/DO/CP, gaining MAJ-
         COM as required, HQ AFMC WRIGHT PATTERSON AFB OH//SEW// (for aircraft related
         incidents only), others as appropriate. Note: Refer to Attachment 6 (Added) for information
         regarding DMS addressing.
16                                                       AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006


            3.3.13.9.3. (Added-AFRC) For AFRC OPREP-3 HOMELINEs only: Units will NOT
            address HQ USAF/RE on the record report. HQ AFRC/DOCC notifies HQ USAF/RE via
            other channels.
        3.3.13.10. (Added-AFRC) Sample Reports:
            3.3.13.10.1. (Added-AFRC) Voice Reports. See Attachment 4 (Added) of this supplement.
            3.3.13.10.2. (Added-AFRC) Record Reports. Follow reporting guidance provided in AFI
            10-206, Operational Reporting.
        3.3.13.11. (Added-AFRC) In addition to the OPREP-3 HOMELINE report, certain events/inci-
        dents may generate a requirement to submit other types of reports. The submission of an OPREP-3
        HOMELINE does not alleviate this requirement. In addition, submit an OPREP-3 HOMELINE if
        the event/incident meets HOMELINE reporting criteria, regardless of whether the event/incident
        has or will be reported through other channels using other types of reporting.
     3.3.14. OPREP-3 CRESCENT EDGE (OPREP-3CE). Used to immediately notify program man-
     agers at the Joint Staff, Air Force, or MAJCOM level of significant activities involving Special
     Access Programs (SAPs) operating under the auspices of AFI 16-701. Affected unit command posts
     will submit voice reports through normal command post channels. The flagwords HOMELINE, BEE-
     LINE, and PINNACLE are used to reference the level of the program manager to be contacted. If the
     program manager is at the Air Force level the AFOC will notify the program manager. MAJCOMs
     will establish procedures for contacting program managers at and below the MAJCOM level.
        3.3.14.1. The CRESCENT EDGE Report allows units operating SAPs to use the operational
        reporting channel to advise their program managers of events or incidents that meet OPREP-3
        reporting criteria. The CRESCENT EDGE Report is the single reporting channel for all SAP units
        reporting incidents to higher headquarters. Crescent Edge Reports will be forwarded through com-
        mand post channels to MAJCOM Command Centers, the AFOC, or the NMCC as required
        depending on the program manager level. Refer to Figure 3.1. to view a sample voice report.
        3.3.14.2. The unit with the SAP, not the command post, initiates CRESCENT EDGE reports. The
        initiating unit will notify the command post that they have a CRESCENT EDGE report to be sub-
        mitted. No program names or incident details will be included, and command post personnel will
        not press for details. The command post will assign a report number and send the report up the
        chain to the appropriate level. After report submission, no other action is required by the command
        post.
        3.3.14.3. Only the following information will be included in the report:
            3.3.14.3.1. The time the unit initiated the report.
            3.3.14.3.2. The name, phone number, and office symbol of the person at the unit initiating the
            report.
            3.3.14.3.3. The name, phone number, and office symbol of the program manager at the appro-
            priate higher headquarters.
        3.3.14.4. A CRESCENT EDGE Report will be submitted when an event or incident involving a
        SAP has been determined, by an authorized individual from the SAP unit, that higher-level aware-
        ness is warranted.
AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006                                                                        17


           3.3.14.4.1. It is the reporting unit’s responsibility, not the command post’s or wing com-
           mander’s, to determine the level the report will be submitted, and to provide all the informa-
           tion to be reported IAW paragraph 3.3.14.3. above.
           3.3.14.4.2. The parent MAJCOM, the AFOC, or the NMCC (as deemed applicable) are the
           only addressees permitted on record copy CRESCENT EDGE reports. If report goes to the
           AFOC or NMCC, MAJCOM and the AFOC will be addressed.
           3.3.14.4.3. The CRESCENT EDGE voice and record copy reports will be sent via normal
           reporting channels using FLASH or IMMEDIATE precedence. This report is unclassified;
           however, record copy reports will be transmitted Encrypt for Transmission Only (EFTO).
   3.3.15. EXERCISE WHITE PINNACLE--OPREP-3 WHITE PINNACLE (OPREP-3WP).
   OPREP-3WP is an unclassified exercise flagword used in exercise messages that contain simulated,
   time-critical information from operating forces to the NMCC. This exercise is used by the NMCC and
   combatant commanders to exercise the timeliness of the OPREP-3 PINNACLE reports.
       3.3.15.1. Regional Operations Support Division (ROSD), Operations, Training, and Exercise
       (OT&E) Branch, J-3 DDRO, will recommend to unified commands via message the number of
       exercises to be conducted within the assigned period. Unified commands will designate the units
       to receive the exercise message and will select specific exercise start times.
       3.3.15.2. Detailed guidance is governed by CJCSM 3150.03B (Joint Reporting Structure Event
       and Incident Reports). Only unified commands, units subordinate to unified commands, and the
       NMCC participate in this exercise.

3.4. Command Responsibilities. Due to the time sensitivity of OPREP-3 information, report each event/
incident as promptly and accurately as possible. If there is doubt, report it. Units at all levels will develop
procedures to quickly obtain and report the key elements of an OPREP-3 report. Since installations nor-
mally host units assigned to different MAJCOMs, notification and coordination procedures between units
must be agreed upon. Therefore, host, tenant, and applicable MAJCOMs will have a MOA on file (IAW
para 1.3.). Commanders should ensure all agencies under their command receive OPREP-3 training at
least quarterly.
   3.4.1. Command posts will thoroughly brief commanders on all reporting criteria and procedures out-
   lined in this instruction. Prior to the command post submission, the commander or designated alter-
   nate will review all OPREP-3 reports in a timely manner. The command post is responsible for
   providing commanders the necessary information to facilitate an informed decision and timely
   OPREP-3 voice and record-copy submissions IAW this instruction (para. 3.5.1. and 3.5.2.) and
   CJCSM 3150.03B (Enclosure A, para 3).
   3.4.2. (Added-AFRC) The senior Air Reserve Technician of each command post will ensure
   OPREP-3 reporting requirements/criteria are briefed to lateral agencies (e.g., security forces, mainte-
   nance, operations) to be sure that all events and incidents are immediately brought to the attention of
   the command post. The fact that an OPREP-3 reportable event or incident has been or will be reported
   via other channels (e.g., Serious Incident Reports) does not eliminate the requirement for an OPREP-3
   report.
   3.4.3. (Added-AFRC) Where AFRC is the host, the AFRC command post is responsible for famil-
   iarizing other base agencies (such as security forces, flying, maintenance, and aerial port squadrons),
   tenant units, and the unit commanders and staff regarding OPREP-3 reporting requirements. Where
18                                                       AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006


     AFRC is a tenant, the AFRC command post will familiarize other AFRC agencies regarding reporting
     requirements.

3.5. Report Submission. The closest command post to the location where an event/incident has occurred
having knowledge of that event/incident will submit the OPREP-3 reports. When necessary, the AFOC
may request, through the MAJCOM, that a unit report an event/incident because that unit is located clos-
est to where the event/incident occurred.
     3.5.1. Voice Reports: Air Force units will submit voice reports to the appropriate MAJCOM com-
     mand center via telephone conference. IAW CJCSM 3150.03B, OPREP-3 voice reports will be sub-
     mitted as soon as possible after an event or incident has occurred using FLASH or IMMEDIATE
     precedence. The goal is to initiate initial voice reports within 15 minutes of an event or incident. Due
     to the extremely time sensitive nature of the PINNACLE NUCFLASH report, these voice reports
     must be made within 5 minutes after the incident and sent at FLASH precedence.
        3.5.1.1. Normal conferencing procedures for BEELINE and Service-level reports (Bent Spear
        and Faded Giant) will be unit-to-MAJCOM-to-AFOC. Procedures for PINNACLE reports will be
        unit-to-MAJCOM-to-AFOC-to-NMCC. Because the audible quality of some conferencing sys-
        tems is degraded with each added conferee, the AFOC will conference in the NMCC for PINNA-
        CLE reports. MAJCOMs or lower echelons may add additional conferees to conferences as
        appropriate. Ensure the AFOC is the last conferee added to the conference.
            3.5.1.1.1. (Added-AFRC) Submit all OPREP-3 HOMELINE, BEELINE, and PINNACLE
            voice reports through HQ AFRC Command Center. Use DSN as the primary method for voice
            reports; use alternate methods as needed. The AFRC Command Center will conference
            NMCC, AFOC, NAF, and other MAJCOMS, as required. In the event AFRC Command Cen-
            ter is communication-out, units will voice their BEELINE and PINNACLE reports directly to
            AFOC, DSN 227-6103, commercial (703) 697-6103, or NMCC, DSN 227-6340, commercial
            (703) 697-6340, as appropriate. Units will telephonically back-brief AFRC Command Center
            and NAF as soon as possible.
            3.5.1.1.2. (Added-AFRC) OPREP-3 BEELINE and PINNACLE reports will include AFRC/
            Command Center (uc), appropriate NAF/DO/DOOC, parent wing/CP, and gaining command/
            advisory unit/DO/DOC as information addressees
        3.5.1.2. When reporting on any asset assigned to a MAJCOM other than that of the reporting unit,
        ensure the MAJCOM command center owning the asset is included in the voice conference and
        addressed on the record copy report.
        3.5.1.3. When reporting on any nuclear event, ensure USSTRATCOM is included in the voice
        conference (Unclassified: DSN 271-1806, Comm 402-294-1806 / Classified: DSN 272-4405,
        Comm 402-232-4405) and addressed on the record copy report (MEA 38).
        3.5.1.4. MAJCOM command centers will screen HOMELINE reports for possible BEELINE cri-
        teria. The AFOC will screen BEELINE reports for possible PINNACLE criteria. When in doubt,
        consult the appropriate MAJCOM or the AFOC through the MAJCOM.
        3.5.1.5. Units submitting the OPREP-3 PINNACLE or BEELINE voice report will provide the
        MAJCOM and the AFOC the rule number and subject of the event/incident being reported. Pro-
        viding the AFOC with the rule number allows preliminary checklist steps to be accomplished
        prior to the unit beginning the voice report. After completion of voice reports, the AFOC will give
AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006                                                                    19


     a reference time in Zulu for record-copy BEELINE reports, and their initials. For PINNACLE
     reports, the AFOC will remind units of CJCSM 3150.03B reporting criteria (see para. 3.5.2.
     below).
     3.5.1.6. If MAJCOM or NAF command centers are unable to establish a teleconference or the
     unit is reporting a classified report and individual phone calls must be made in lieu of a teleconfer-
     ence, the unit will call the AFOC first. The AFOC will attempt to patch the appropriate MAJCOM
     command center(s) and the NMCC (if applicable) into the conference.
     3.5.1.7. For PINNACLE and BEELINE Reports: Do not delay the initial voice report by prepar-
     ing the record copy report prior to voicing the report.
     3.5.1.8. Contact the NMCC directly for nuclear related PINNACLE reports. Intermediate com-
     mand centers will be conferenced if time permits and only if it does not cause a delay in immedi-
     ately voicing these reports to the NMCC. For direct contact to the NMCC, use DSN 223-8196 for
     the Senior Operations Officer (SOO (primary)) or DSN 227-6340 for the EA Cell (secondary).
  3.5.2. Record-copy Reports: IAW CJCSM 3150.03B, the goal is to submit initial record copy PIN-
  NACLE reports within 1 hour of the incident. IAW this instruction, submit all record copy BEELINE
  reports within 1 hour after the associated voice report. Intermediate levels of command will immedi-
  ately pass the report to subordinate or lateral commands that need the information.
     3.5.2.1. The AFOC may request certain questions answered prior to submission of the final
     report. Information requested by the AFOC that is unknown during the initial voice report will be
     provided (when the information becomes available) in the INITIAL record copy report or
     FOLUP/FINAL voice/hard copy reports.
  3.5.3. Do not include the following statements: “The commander has deemed the following report-
  able” and “Further reporting through xxx channels” in OPREP-3 BEELINE or PINNACLE reports.
     3.5.3.1. The first statement in the text of INITIAL record copy reports will state the time the com-
     mand post was notified of the event/incident, and the time the commander or designated alternate
     approved the voice report for command post submission. Example: “The command post was noti-
     fied at 27/1829Z Jul 03, and the commander approved the voice report at 27/1918Z Jul 03.” Do
     not include this information in the voice report.
  3.5.4. Units will ensure all record copy OPREP-3 reports on Class “A” Mishaps are addressed to all
  MAJCOM command centers to include ANG Operations Center and AFRC Command Center using
  the MEA Listing (Table 3.5.). Additionally, address appropriate MAJCOM command centers to
  include ANG and AFRC when personnel and/or assets (active, guard or reserve, mobilized or
  non-mobilized) assigned to those organizations are affected. If units have problems transmitting over
  DMS, use regular NIPRNET/SIPRNET e-mail addresses (Table 3.2.) to forward reports.
  3.5.5. Intermediate levels of command and or the unit originating the report will immediately pass the
  report to subordinate or lateral commands whose units or assets are affected by the event/incident.
  3.5.6. Rapid reporting is imperative. Do not delay an INITIAL report to obtain additional informa-
  tion. Use FOLUP reports to provide additional information when it becomes available.
     3.5.6.1. INITIAL reports must be timely and concise, and contain as much information as imme-
     diately available within established time parameters. Record copy reports must thoroughly answer
20                                                      AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006


        the following questions: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Continue reporting until these
        questions are answered.
     3.5.7. Transmit OPREP-3 reports by the fastest means available consistent with security constraints:
     usually by non-secure voice transmission, followed by a confirming record transmission. Transmit
     reports containing classified or special intelligence information with the proper security precautions.
     Include the flagword JOPREP JIFFY after the classification on all OPREP-3 reports.
        3.5.7.1. If units are unable to use DMS to meet record copy timing criteria, forward the record
        copy to the AFOC’s NIPRNET address (Table 3.1.). If electronic transmission capabilities are not
        available, faxing the record copy report to the AFOC can be used to meet timing criteria, however
        electronic transmission is preferred. If the report is sent using NIPRNET or faxed to the AFOC,
        the originating unit is still responsible for ensuring all required MEAs are in receipt of the record
        copy. For OPREP-3 PINNACLEs, the AFOC will ensure the NMCC is in receipt.
     3.5.8. The initial record copy report will contain any updated information gathered after the initial
     voice report without exceeding the time criteria established in paragraph 3.5.2.
     3.5.9. The OPREP-3 PINNACLE NUCFLASH takes precedence over all other OPREP-3 reports.
     3.5.10. Any actual OPREP-3 report takes precedence over all peacetime exercise communications.
     3.5.11. Submission of OPREP-3 reports will not be effected by the imposition of MINIMIZE.
     3.5.12. Use the ESC “C1” designator - Continue reporting, priority.

3.6. Report Format and Contents: AFPAM 10-709 V 1CD gives specific format information for
OPREP-3 reporting.
     3.6.1. The narrative section of each report must clearly convey the details of the incident. Use Figure
     3.2. to assist in gathering and reporting all minimum required events/incident details.

3.7. Report Numbering. Number OPREP-3 reports consecutively for each calendar year by type, (i.e.
PINNACLE, BEELINE) beginning with 001. Subsequent reports for the same incident will add sequen-
tial letters to the basic report number (e.g., 002A, 002B). After the number 999, revert to 001 for the next
report. Report numbers are designed for the individual unit to track the total number of OPREP-3 reports
submitted per year.
     3.7.1. (Added-AFRC) Units will maintain a separate OPREP log and numbering system for each
     type of report (i.e. HOMELINEs will be numbered separately from BEELINEs and PINNACLEs).
     OPREP numbering systems will be maintained on a calendar year basis. For example, the first
     OPREP-3 HOMELINE for calendar year 2003 will be assigned 001, second 002, third 003, etc. Each
     type or category of OPREP-3 (HOMELINE, BEELINE, PINNACLE, etc.) will begin with 001, and
     so on. Follow-up reports will contain a sequential alphabetical character. For example, a follow up
     report to the first HOMELINE for calendar year 2003 would read 001A, 001B, 001C, and so on.

3.8. Exercise Reports. Number exercise OPREP-3 reports independently of real-world OPREP-3
reports. Begin exercise reports with 001 at the start of each exercise. Indicate exercise name in the EXER
set of each report.
AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006                                                                   21


3.9. Follow-up Reports. FOLUP reports are essential to keep commanders informed of developing situ-
ations and to provide additional details as they are learned.
   3.9.1. Record copy FOLUP or FINAL reports may contain information previously provided in one or
   more voice reports. Continue reporting as long as the situation merits. When the immediacy of the
   OPREP-3 system subsides, commanders may use SITREP reporting to provide continuous informa-
   tion. Include a reference to applicable voice and record copy reports in each additional record report.
   3.9.2. FOLUP and FINAL reports will be voiced in the same manner as INITIAL voice reports, and
   a record copy report will be submitted.
   3.9.3. INITIAL, FOLUP, and FINAL reports will close with the applicable phrase, i.e., this is a com-
   mand post INITIAL, FOLUP, or FINAL report.
   3.9.4. FOLUP and FINAL reports will contain enough information from the previous report(s) to aid
   the recipient.
   3.9.5. When it is determined that situations are no longer developing, units will send the appropriate
   voice and record report (IAW para 3.9.4.) and add the phrase, "No further information available. This
   is a final report" to close INITIAL and FOLUP reports.

3.10. Use of Personnel Identification. Do not include the name, social security number (SSN), or
address of individuals in OPREP-3 reports. Rather, provide broad categories (e.g., active duty, reserve,
airman, noncommissioned officer (NCO), officer, or dependent). If a report recipient requires names or
SSN, request it as an addendum separate from OPREP-3s. Exceptions: OPREP-3CE (the name and phone
number of both POCs are required), and for aircraft accidents, the name, title, and phone number of safety

   3.10.1. (Added-AFRC) When requested by AFRC Command Center, provide personal data (names,
   SSNs, etc.) on personnel involved in events/incidents (voice only).

3.11. Upgrading Reports. Units will upgrade OPREP-3 reports if FOLUP information to an event/inci-
dent meets the criteria of a higher-level report (e.g., HOMELINE to BEELINE). Units will report the INI-
TIAL information and any FOLUP information as a new report. Also include any references to earlier
reports. In the upgraded INITIAL report, provide all known facts even if previously reported to the lower
level organization. Upgrade reports will require both a voice and record copy. Send all FOLUP reports to
the appropriate addressees.

3.12. AFOC Contact Information. Table 3.1. provides secure and non-secure DSN numbers, commer-
cial numbers, and NIPRNET addresses for the AFOC.

3.15. The OPREP-3 Reports Matrix. The OPREP-3 Reports Matrix (Table 3.4.) is a quick reference
guide to assist users in determining the type of report to submit. The matrix provides broad guidance and
is not all-inclusive. Judgement on the part of local command posts and commanders is essential to proper
reporting. Base the level of the report on whether or not the event or incident will attract national level
interest (PINNACLE) or will only be of interest to HQ USAF (BEELINE) or a MAJCOM (HOMELINE).
Refer to Figure 3.1. through Figure 3.7. for additional guidance on minimum OPREP-3 report content.

   Structure (JRS) report will be referenced to ensure operational impacts are noted.
   4.6.2. Any higher headquarters level in the reporting chain may direct additional reporting require-
   ments. The Air Force Operations Group, in fulfilling the CSAF's Title 10 responsibilities, is autho-
   rized to request any necessary additional/amplifying information on past events, current operations, or
   planned actions. A quick response to requests for information from the AFOC, Air Force Crisis
   Action Team, or CSAF Presentation Division is required.
   4.6.3. During peacetime MSCA operations and under hostile conditions such as terrorism, comply
   with Figure 3.4. and the daily reporting instruction timeline described in the supported Combatant
   Command’s Execute Order.
   4.6.3. (AFRC) The Air Force National Security Emergency Preparedness (AFNSEP) Division, Ft
   McPherson, GA, issues USAF mission designators to authorize Civil Air Patrol missions and validate
   USAF unit assistance to civil agencies during natural or man-made disasters. USAF mission designa-
   tors are assigned consecutively at the start of each fiscal year. For example, the first mission designa-
   tor in FY01 would be MD-1-01, the second would be MD-2-01, etc. The first in FY02 would be
   MD-1-02. During duty hours the AFNSEP Division can be contacted at DSN 367-4342/commercial
   404-464-4342. After duty hours, those requesting mission designators should contact the Forces Com-
   mand watch officer, at DSN 367-5222/commercial 404-464-5222, who will patch the caller through to
   the AFNSEP duty officer.

4.7. Report Content. Air Force SITREPs will evaluate significant factors relating primarily to readiness,
mobilization personnel, and logistics. Report content should highlight key activities and build on previous

 COMMUNICATIONS INSTRUCTIONS REPORTING VITAL INTELLIGENCE SIGHTINGS
                              (CIRVIS)

5.1. Subject and Purpose. This report provides vital information to the security of the United States and
Canada which, in the opinion of the observer, requires very urgent defensive action or investigation by the
US and or Canadian Armed Forces.

5.2. Reference Materials. NORAD Instruction 10-19.

5.3. Submitted By. Any Air Force personnel.

5.4. Submitted To:
     5.4.1. Airborne reports: US or Canadian military or civilian communications facility.
     5.4.2. Post-landing reports: Commander, North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD),
     Cheyenne Mt, Colorado, or HQ Northern NORAD Region, North Bay, Ontario, Canada, whichever is
     more convenient. If landing outside Canadian or US territories, submit reports through the nearest US
     or Canadian military or diplomatic representative.

5.5. When Submitted. As soon as possible after the intelligence sighting.

5.6. How Submitted. Reports are normally UNCLASSIFIED but handled as For Official Use Only.
     5.6.1. Use the most rapid means of transmission available. For airborne reports use the same proce-
     dures as for air traffic control. When pilots cannot establish contact with a ground station, make max-
     imum effort to relay the report via other aircraft.
     5.6.2. To avoid delays while airborne, repeat the word CIRVIS three times before the message to pre-
     empt all other communications (except distress and urgency). If this fails to clear the frequencies, use
     the International Urgency Signal "PAN" spoken three times. For the ground relay of airborne reports
     or post-landing reports, use FLASH precedence.
     5.6.3. Transmit during MINIMIZE.
     5.6.4. Use the ESC C1 designator- Continue reporting, priority.

5.7. Reporting Instructions:
     5.7.1. Facilities receiving CIRVIS reports will rapidly process and forward them as prescribed by
     NORAD Instruction 10-19.
     5.7.2. Report all unidentifiable, suspicious, or hostile traffic (land, aerospace, or seaborne) which,
     because of its nature, course, or actions, considered a threat to the security of the United States or Can-
     ada. Such reporting extends the early warning defense system for the United States and Canada. There
     are five types of CIRVIS reports:
        5.7.2.1. Issue initial CIRVIS reports while airborne (or as warranted, upon landing).
        5.7.2.2. Issue post-landing CIRVIS reports if airborne reports made.
AFI10-206_AFRCSUP1_I 17 JANUARY 2006                                                                  69


     5.7.2.3. Issue follow-up CIRVIS reports by anyone with additional information about an earlier
     report (refer to the initial report).
     5.7.2.4. Issue cancellation CIRVIS reports once sightings are positively identified as friendly or
     determined it was erroneously reported.
     5.7.2.5. Submit evaluation CIRVIS reports to each addressee of the above CIRVIS reports.
     Promptly submit evaluation reports to keep all interested parties fully informed.
  5.7.3. Report the following specific sightings:
     5.7.3.1. Hostile or unidentified aircraft which appears directed against the United States, Canada,
     or their forces.
     5.7.3.2. Missiles.
     5.7.3.3. Unidentified flying objects.
     5.7.3.4. Hostile or unidentified military surface vessels or submarines.
     5.7.3.5. Any other individual surface vessels, submarines, or aircraft of unconventional design
     engaged in suspicious activity, observed in an unusual location, or on a course which may threaten
     the United States, Canada, or their forces.
     5.7.3.6. Any unexplained or unusual activity which may indicate a possible attack against or
     through Canada or the United States (includes the presence of any unidentified or suspicious
     ground parties in remote or sparsely populated areas, including the polar region).
     5.7.3.7. Unlisted airfields, facilities, weather stations, or air navigation aids.
  5.7.4. Make every effort to document sightings with as many photographs as possible. Send undevel-
  oped film or prints and negatives, with a brief written report and other identifying information to the
  Director of Naval Intelligence, Department of the Navy, Washington, DC 20305. The Department of
  the Navy will process the film and return one copy of each print and a roll of new film to the individ-
  ual.
  5.7.5. Use Figure 5.1. to gather and report specific sighting details.
