1.      Volume 4 Clinical Skills--Preventive Dentistry, Qualification Training Package (QTP)
contains modules on Clinical phase/fundamentals, oral health care instructions, periodontal
instruments, and removing accumulated deposits. This QTP is designed to enhance 5-skill level
on-the-job training (OJT) of dental assistant journeyman. Training references listed in each
module may be used to compliment training. All QTPs are intended to be used by trainees,
trainers, supervisors, and task certifiers. Before initiating any training you should review your
responsibilities as a supervisor/trainer for conducting OJT per AFI 36-2201, Chapter 6, Air Force
Training Program On-The-Job Training Administration.

2.       QTPs are instructional packages designed to help you conduct and evaluate your field
training. Once you begin upgrade training you are required to use the QTPs. QTPs provide
continuity to the trainee’s upgrade training and are divided into the following volumes: 1) Basic
Skills and Infection Control/Sterilization; 2) Clinical Skills-Radiology; 3) Clinical Skills-
Chairside Assisting; 4) Clinical Skills-Preventive Dentistry; 5) Patient Administration, 6)
Logistics Management; 7) Budget and Financial Planning and 8) Supervision and Training. The
QTP modules were designed to assist you in preparing for and conducting training. Each module
segments the major tasks into teachable elements. Your goal is to provide enough training and
guidance so trainees can do all task related steps, without assistance. QTPs also aid OJT task
certifiers in evaluating the trainee’s demonstrated performance. If you have local training
requirements not covered by a QTP module you should develop “steps in performance” and
“performance checklists” that support and standardize those tasks. When you are satisfied the
trainee meets standards, as prescribed in the QTP performance checklist, you must document
each task completion in the QTP tab. If a person is being recertified on a task that is supported
by a QTP you must use that module to complete the recertification process.

3.       Typically, you will manage each module by first, training the tasks and then, evaluating
performance. Your local steps in performance may vary from the method listed in the QTP
module. If this is the case, you are authorized to make changes to the first half of each module,
(i.e. steps in task performance); however, the “performance checklist” is considered a standard
and cannot be altered. You may train each QTP volume/module in any sequence; however, when
conducting training use an organized and methodical approach. This will reduce your training
time and enhance your efforts.

4.       The QTPs are a tool for assessing/certifying the Dental Assistant initially and each time
they arrive at a new duty station. The QTP should be used as a tool for standardizing annual
refresher training. Our goal has been to publish a useable document for both the trainee and
trainer. We value your first hand expertise and solicit your feedback on how we can improve our
product. Direct all inquiries to:
