3.1. General. MQT provides intelligence personnel the training needed to perform in their
assigned duty positions supporting MQ-1&9 missions/operations. This chapter provides
guidance to assist SIOs in developing and executing their MQT program. MQT execution will
take into account assigned duty position, current qualifications, prior experience and training,
currency, documented performance and/or formal training achieved by each individual.
Accomplish MQT through one-on-one instruction from a qualified trainer, external courses, or
other training opportunities that satisfy the requirements for MQT. Use applicable portions of
MQT to create a requalification program for personnel who are in non-CMR (N-CMR) or non-
BMC (N-BMC) status. (T-2)
   3.1.1. Prior to completing MQT, member must have completed IQT. (T-3)
   3.1.2. MQT begins within 45 days (90 days for Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and
   ANG) of the individual’s first duty day at the gaining unit or immediately after the
   completion of IQT. Timelines for completion of MQT for each MAJCOM and reporting
   requirements are specified in the following paragraphs.
       3.1.2.1. RegAF units will complete MQT within 120 days after start.               Notify
       MAJCOM/A2 if training exceeds this timeline. (T-2)
       3.1.2.2. AFRC units and IMAs will complete MQT within 365 calendar days. However,
       AFRC AGR/ARTs or reservists on full-time orders of 120 consecutive days or greater
       will complete MQT per the RegAF timeline. Notify MAJCOM Intelligence IMA
       Program Manager and AFRC/A2 if training timelines are exceeded. (T-2)
       3.1.2.3. Non-prior service ANG personnel will complete MQT within 120 days with
       Mission Essential Skills Training (MEST) Days, or 180 days for personnel not authorized
       MEST days. Notify the NGB /A2 and ACC/A2 if training exceeds this timeline. (T-2)
   3.1.3. MAJCOM/A2s will consolidate unit reporting of personnel exceeding allowable time
   lines and notify ACC/A2 on an annual basis.
   3.1.4. AF Form 4381, Intelligence Gradesheet. Use the AF Form 4381 to document the
   trainee’s progression through each individual training item. Specific MQT gradesheet
   elements are located in attachment 3. (T-2)

   maintenance for electronic target folder construction.
4.4. Ready Intelligence Program. The intent of RIP is to ensure intelligence personnel
perform specific mission essential tasks with sufficient frequency to maintain proficiency in their
duty positions. In order to maximize training opportunities and minimize artificiality, conduct
RIP tasks in conjunction with day-to-day missions or exercises as much as possible. (T-2)
   4.4.1. The task requirements listed in Table 4.1. MQ-1&9 Ready Intelligence Program and
   Currency Requirements, establish the minimum frequency requirements for CMR and BMC.
   Failure to accomplish these requirements will affect the individual’s CMR or BMC status
   and additional training will be required as determined by the SIO. (T-2)
   4.4.2. Intelligence personnel must complete appropriate RIP tasks to maintain currency. If
   an intelligence specialist loses currency in a particular area, the individual may not perform
   that task unsupervised until currency is regained. Individuals are responsible for
   documenting RIP task completion. (T-2)

4.5. Regression. If personnel do not meet currency requirements throughout the training cycle,
they will be regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC status, as applicable. The SIO will direct the member
who fails to demonstrate proficiency in a given task to be regressed. Document regression and

the steps required to correct the situation in the individual's training record. Intelligence
personnel regressed to N-CMR/N-BMC must complete a SIO-approved requalification program
to return them to CMR/BMC standards. The tasks accomplished during the re-qualification
program are credited toward currency task requirements for the training cycle. (T-3)
4.6. Requalification. For intelligence personnel whose qualification has expired, refer to AFI
14-202, Volume 1.
AFI14-2MQ-1&9V1 3 APRIL 2014                                                                  19

personnel with current qualifications, prior experience, currency, documented performance or
formal training. Unless governed by a formal syllabus, these programs will consist of unit-
developed academics and scenarios. Document ST on the AF Form 4381 (see Attachment 4 for
the appropriate gradesheet elements). Attachment 5 lists the minimum ST requirements outlined
in the following paragraphs. (T-2)
