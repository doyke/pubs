     for AFMC Tier 1 VTC Systems, dated Apr 09.
     2.1.3. Electronic devices of any type, such as tape recorders, radios, beepers, cell phones,
     Blackberrys, etc., are not permitted in the VTC room during classified briefings. Battery

     storage.   ALL DEVICES MUST REMAIN OUTSIDE THE FACILITY DURING
     CLASSIFIED VTCs.
     2.1.4. Recording of classified conferences is prohibited. Video Cassette Recorders (VCRs)
     shall be powered off at the VCR device prior to the start of a classified VTC session. (PECS-

     2.1.5. The loss or compromise of any classified information or keying material at a VTC
     must be promptly reported through appropriate security channels.
     2.1.6. Access Control. The facility is normally comprised of four distinct rooms; the VTC
     room, the foyer, the equipment room, and the utility (air conditioning/power) room. All of
     these rooms must be secured while in a secure mode and when the encryption devices are
     loaded.
     2.1.7. A facilitator must remain in the VTC studio when a classified VTC is in session.

   of the conference chairperson (customer) IAW 2.2.4.1. Foreign National participation shall
   be IAW Local Foreign Disclosure Office endorsements and need-to-know.
2.2. Secure VTC Setup Procedures.
   2.2.1. For point-to-point and multi-point VTCs the connection is established in the secure
   mode. After secure connectivity is confirmed the facilitator will ensure secure VTC indicator
   light in the VTC studio is on and also post a sign either on the outside of the VTC facility
   door, outside of the controlled area, or both, to warn that a secure VTC is in session.
   2.2.2. At the VTC chairing location, the conference chairperson (customer) should poll each
   site to confirm that identities of all participants have been verified and compared against their
   attendance lists. Attendance lists will be transmitted to other sites by the conference
   chairperson if required.
   2.2.3. The conference chairperson should announce the security level of the meeting prior to
   starting any discussions.
   2.2.4. The conference chairperson who requests a secure VTC (customer) has the overall
   responsibility for security clearance verification of all attendees prior to the VTC.
       2.2.4.1. The VTC conference chairperson ensures that the point of contact at each
       location obtains the proper clearance verifications for the attendees at their respective
       locations in accordance with established procedures. The chairperson is responsible for
       ensuring all participants invited to attend VTC are cleared at the appropriate level when
       conference is classified. It is not the facilitator’s responsibility to maintain clearances on
       file.
   2.2.5. Facilitators must have a security clearance equal to the level of the COMSEC key at
   the particular facility. Secret is a minimum requirement.
2.3. Physical Security.
   2.3.1. Each local organization will ensure their facility meets all local requirements for
   initially operating at the Secret level.
   2.3.2. VTC facilities will not be used to store customer’s classified materials. The customer
   must provide all classified materials required for a VTC and all materials brought in or
   generated during the VTC must be removed from the facility by the customer immediately
   following the VTC.
   2.3.3. At the end of a classified conference, the facilitator will ensure that the VTC room and
   equipment is properly sanitized by ensuring removal of all classified materials and rebooting
   the codec device.
   2.3.4. The customer will provide personnel for additional physical security (door guard)
   during classified conferences.

3.1. AFMC RESERVATION MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES.
    3.1.1. The AFMC VTC facilities are available for use by all DOD government organizations
    on a first come- first serve basis; however, AFMC related VTCs have priority over non-

       the reservationist will offer another date/time for the conference.
       3.1.3.2. The preempted conference chairperson shall notify all participants of the revised
       schedule.
    3.1.4. When using the Defense Video Services Worldwide Scheduling System (DVS-WS),

    information in the automated reservation system. A confirmation number confirms each
    scheduled VTC.
       3.1.4.1. The following information from the conference chairperson is required to
       schedule a VTC:
       3.1.4.2. Requested date of conference

  Emergency or high priority situations may arise that will require preempting existing
  conferences.
  3.1.7. Changes can only be made to an existing conference by the conference chairperson at
  the site that initially established the scheduled conference (chairing site).
  3.1.8. All changes must be made more than 48 hours prior to conference start time. No
  changes can be made after that time, i.e., adding/dropping sites, extending/changing
  conference time, etc. Exceptions will be considered for high level, i.e., flag/SES level VTC’s
  only.
  3.1.9. When cancellations occur, the conference chairperson must provide immediate
  notification to the reservation office.
     3.1.9.1. The reservation office shall immediately access the Defense Information
     Systems Network (DISN) Video Services automated scheduling system and cancel the
     conference.
     3.1.9.2. If cancellation occurs within 4 hours of the conference start time, the reservation
     office shall call the DISN Customer Call Center (DCCC) to cancel.
     3.1.9.3. The conference chairperson (customer) is responsible for contacting all
     participants to inform them of the cancellation.

     monitoring cancellation of future requirements.

     a Tier 1 call will be disconnected.
