                                 PROGRAM DESCRIPTIONS.

Section 1A—Mission

1.1. Mission. The mission of the USAF Medical Service is to ensure maximum wartime
readiness and combat capability by maintaining the health of Air Force personnel, providing
health care to deployed military personnel, and by providing a peacetime health care delivery
system for beneficiaries. By developing the knowledge, skills and attitudes of highly qualified
medical personnel, educational programs are critical in helping meet this mission

Section 1B—Policy.

1.2. Policy. USAF Medical Service education programs must meet published standards and
criteria of their discipline or specialty.
1.3. Accreditation. Air Force medical facilities and other agencies conducting education
programs must apply for and maintain accreditation by the national accrediting agency for each
program.
     1.3.1. Air Force institutions sponsoring accredited programs must ensure that the programs
     continue to meet accreditation standards and criteria.
     1.3.2. Commanders of institutions conducting accredited programs must arrange for
     representatives of the appropriate accrediting body to make periodic evaluations and site
     visits.
1.4. Program Evaluation. Sponsors must develop a system for both internal and field
evaluations of the education programs.
     1.4.1. The facility commander (or designee) sets the schedule for internal evaluations, while
     the director of medical education (DME) or a person named by the commander keeps records
     of such evaluations.
     1.4.2. Programs must also conduct field evaluations (attachment 2). Field evaluations are
     administered to graduates 12-18 months post program completion.
     1.4.3. The DME or other designated individual at each facility distributes, collects, and
     evaluates forms once a year.
1.5. Education at Civilian Institutions. Air Force Medical Service personnel may attend
programs at civilian institutions for education only if those institutions and programs meet
published standards and criteria. They must be fully accredited by a recognized national
accrediting agency acceptable to the Surgeon General (where such an accreditation mechanism

1.6. Policy Document. Air Force institutions sponsoring graduate medical education (GME)
programs must develop and maintain a policy document addressing the institution’s commitment
to providing the resources necessary to support GME as described in the Accreditation Council
for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) institutional requirements. The DME, working with
the program directors and the professional education committee, develops this policy, and the
commander approves it.
1.7. Correspondence with Civilian Organizations. Medical commanders, DMEs, and
program directors may correspond directly with national civilian organizations concerning
accreditation of current or proposed education programs conducted in the medical facility and
must ensure organization is not under a corporate integrity agreement, or on the IG Sanction List.
This correspondence must not alter or circumvent Air Force directives on health education.
Correspondence must be recorded in the minutes of the professional education committee.

Section 1D—Medical Education Facilities

1.16. Medical Education Facilities. Air Force education programs take place in Air Force or
other military medical facilities and in civilian schools. Officers may also be assigned to Army,
Navy, or other DoD and civilian locations for required education not available in Air Force
facilities.
1.17. Air Force Medical Facilities. Several medical organizations have teaching missions.
Each is expected to develop an effective CHE program for assigned personnel. The medical
organizations are:
   1.17.1. The designated USAF medical centers.
   1.17.2. Certain regional and other medical treatment facilities.
   1.17.3. The 882nd Training Group.
   1.17.4. The USAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM).

Section 1E—Types of Education Programs.

1.18. Undergraduate Education. Undergraduate programs grant a primary degree and may
include a basic professional degree.
   1.18.1. Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). The School of
   Medicine is a fully accredited medical school. Each year the USAF Medical Corps
   commissions some of its graduates. See the USUHS catalog and AFI 41-110, Medical
   Health Care Professions Scholarship Programs, for mission requirements and application
   procedures.
   1.18.2. F. Edward Herbert Armed Forces Health Profession Scholarship and Financial
   Assistance Program (AFHPSP/FAP). The purpose of AFHPSP/FAP is to ensure the Air
   Force has enough qualified health professionals to meet Air Force requirements. Individuals
   must meet qualifications set by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs)
   (OASD/HA). Students accepted by an accredited civilian school inside the United States,
   Puerto Rico, GDE, or GME programs, in the appropriate disciplines, may apply for Air Force
   sponsorship. For more information see AFI 41-110.
   1.18.3. Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC). Selected cadets enrolled in
   AFROTC may be tendered a scholarship to complete undergraduate or graduate programs.
   These programs prepare cadets to enter the health professions. For additional information on
   AFROTC sponsorship, see AFROTCI 36-2011 Special Actions Programs
   1.18.4. Health Professions Scholarship Program for Reserve Components. Incentive
   programs are available for certain health professionals. For more information, see AFI 41-
   110.
1.19. Graduate Education. Programs in this category provide specialized education and meet
the educational requirements for certification set by a specialty board or other military or civilian
authority. An advanced academic degree may be an integral part of the program. Education
Training and Course Announcements (ETCA) lists program types, eligibility criteria, and
application process.
AFI41-117 13 OCTOBER 2011                                                                      13


1.20. Continuing Health Education (CHE) Programs. CHE programs are short term courses
or education programs that maintain professional and technical knowledge or teach additional
skills that are used by the USAF Medical Service. These programs are intended to refresh
officers in various aspects of their professional discipline and inform them of new developments
and techniques within their field. The Air Force has a strong commitment to CHE in order to
prepare competent personnel for the delivery of excellent patient care. Programs are conducted
by USAF/SG, major command surgeons, USAF schools, medical treatment facilities, and
civilian organizations.
1.21. Extern and Clerk Programs. Medical organizations may provide extern and clerk
programs for AFHPSP students, Air Force Reserve personnel, medical ROTC educational delay
students, and USUHS students. Civilian students may participate at the discretion of the
commander if a memorandum of understanding has been accomplished between the MTF and
the civilian institution (see AFI 41-108, Training Affiliation Agreements). Officers attending
training under HPSP/FAP sponsorship will not be placed on orders to attend an extern or clerk
program outside CONUS, including Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico, unless they are attending
school at that location.
1.22. Officer Exchange Program. To improve the level of care and maintain the professional
competence of Medical Service specialists, officers in smaller hospitals may request up to 60
days of permissive TDY (see AFI 36-3003) in a regional hospital or medical center in the
practice of their specialty. A similar specialist from the regional hospital or medical center may
request 60 days of permissive TDY to the smaller hospital on an exchange basis. These
programs must be clearly defined as educational programs in order to qualify. The respective
hospital commanders and command surgeons must approve the permissive TDY.

Section 1F—Allocation of Education Positions

1.23. Health Professions Education Requirements Board (HPERB). The USAF Surgeon
General or his/her designee will convene a HPERB the spring of each year to determine required
officer skill progression training positions for the next training cycle.
1.24. Product Line Champions. The HPERB President will appoint each Product Line (PL) at
least one PL Champion. The number and composition of PLs will be determined by USAF/SG1
in sufficient time to allow appointees a minimum of 120 days to prepare for the HPERB. All
corps must be represented. In general, PL Champions are appointed USAF/SG consultants in
their specialty.
1.25. Training Requests. PL Champions will solicit input from other consultants, GME
program directors, MAJCOMs, training facilities and other functional experts as deemed
appropriate by the PL Champion. Input from all sources will be in summarized in a Training
Requirement Worksheet submitted to the appropriate PL Champion. PL Champions will review
all submissions and comment as needed. AFPC/DPAM will collect the information for inclusion
into the HPERB Forecast Working Book. PL Champions may require additional coordination.
All requests for AFIT funding must be coordinated through the AFIT Healthcare Education

1.26. Responsibilities.
   1.26.1. AFPC/DPAM will prepare a staffing analysis for each officer AFSC (40C0
   exempted), showing gains from training and recruiting; and anticipated losses from
   retirements, separations, and training. Generally, the staffing analysis begins with the current
   year data and extends into future fiscal years to at least the impact year (year the trainee re-
   enters workforce after completing training) unless otherwise specified by USAF/SG1.
   1.26.2. USAF/SG1 will determine the maximum number of funded man-years available for
   the next training cycle and provide such to AFPC/DPAM. DPAM identifies the number of
   available man years to the HPERB participants prior to the HPERB.
1.27. Skill Progression Training. Includes Graduate Medical Education (GME), Graduate
Dental Education (GDE), AFIT graduate education, Education with Industry (EWI), and in-
house fellowships to include both clinical and non-clinical. All training must be approved
through the HPERB process.
1.28. Selection Boards. All positions will be advertised throughout the AFMS. AFPC/DPAM
will conduct selection boards at the direction of the convening authority USAF/SG or DoD
Health Affairs (HA). There will be a selection board for each corps. Positions approved at the
HPERB will be classified as approved funded, approved unfunded or disapproved. Approved
unfunded positions will be prioritized by each corps and utilized by the selection boards if
funded man-years are not filled.
1.29. Out-of-Board Actions. Selection boards will only select applicants for specific training
programs approved by the HPERB. Change of training programs i.e., MBA to MHA;
Orthodontics to Prosthodontics; MSN in Nursing Management to MSN in Anesthesia, must be
approved by the HPERB Board President. Additionally, if the requirement is civilian institution
based, changes should be reviewed by AFIT Healthcare Education Division. If a critical training
requirement is identified after the HPERB, the individual identifying the training requirement
will submit a request for training through the appropriate PL Champion, to the appropriate corps
representative at AFPC/DPAM. Out of board requests must include projected manning in the
specialty for which the training is requested; reason training was not requested at the HPERB;
impact if training is delayed for a year; and request for realignment of training man years or a
request for additional man years. The appropriate Corps representative at AFPC/DPAM will
validate projected manning requirements, coordinate the request with AFIT Healthcare Division
if the training requested is managed by AFIT Healthcare Education Division and forward the
request to USAF/SG1. USAF/ SG1will determine if training man-years are available and
forward the request to the HPERB President. Each level of review/coordination must include a
recommendation for approval/disapproval. Training being considered for approval must be
added to the previous approved/unfunded list and re-prioritized by the executive committee of
the HPERB. The revised approved/unfunded list will be forwarded to the HPERB president for
final action. (AFPC/DPAM).

                                             Chapter 2

   RESTRICTION, SUSPENSION, AND TERMINATION OF EDUCATION STATUS.

Section 2A—Basis for Action

2.1. Basis for Action. AFPC/DPAM, in coordination with the selection Board President, may
suspend or withdraw (terminate) USAF Medical Service officers enrolled in health education
programs from education status for various reasons: individual request, prolonged absence from
the program, unsatisfactory academic progress or performance in the program, disciplinary
problems, and other acts or circumstances that warrant release from the program.
2.2. Discretionary Actions.
   2.2.1. Policy. The program structure and methodologies of education programs must be
   flexible. For programs combined with other military services (i.e., National Capital
   Consortium, or San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium), the due
   process procedures of the ACGME recognized consortium may be followed. The AF facility
   DME should ensure that the consortium’s due process procedures are comparable to this
   instruction. The program director or DME can often improve student performance before it
   becomes necessary to extend or terminate training.
       2.2.1.1. Counsel and otherwise help students to overcome any deficiencies.
       2.2.1.2. Document any discretionary actions taken before going on to more serious
       actions that could extend or terminate training.
       2.2.1.3. Discuss such discretionary actions with the student and document the actions in
       the student’s education record.
       2.2.1.4. Inform the DME and, if necessary, the professional education committee, of
       your discretionary actions.
   2.2.2. Types of Discretionary Actions.
       2.2.2.1. Limitations. Limitations refer to conditions that you place on a student’s
       educational activities that restrict the types of activities in which a student can participate.
       The Program Director will determine what type of limitations may be placed on a
       student.
       2.2.2.2. Academic Notice. The Program Director may place students with academic,
       performance or other deficiencies on academic notice. Give such notice in writing,
       including the reason for and the terms and duration of the notice. Outline the actions
       required by the student to correct the problem. Indicate to the student the potential
       consequences if the problems are not corrected. Academic notice is not considered a
       reportable action for future credentialing/licensing.
       2.2.2.3. Formal Probation. Place students on probationary status on the recommendation
       of the professional education committee or its subcommittee. The purpose of probation is
       to impress upon the students the seriousness of their deficiencies and to give the students
       the opportunity to correct those deficiencies. Probation that has been approved by the
AFI41-117 13 OCTOBER 2011                                                                     23


       professional education committee is considered a reportable action for future
       credentialing/licensing.
           2.2.2.3.1. Give students written notice of probation, specifying why the probation
           was imposed and how long it will last. Suggest specific ways to overcome the
           problem. Develop a written remediation plan.           The appropriate office at
           AFPC/DPAM must be provided a copy of all formal probation documentation.
           2.2.2.3.2. The DME may remove probationary status with the concurrence of the
           professional education committee or its appropriate subcommittee.
       2.2.2.4. Other. Take any other actions necessary that affect but are not reasonably
       expected to delay or terminate the student’s education program.
2.3. Administrative or Judicial Action. When beginning or completing administrative or
judicial action against a student (e.g., AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures, or the
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)), the Commander will notify AFPC/DPAM. (For
ARC, see: AFI 36-3209, Separation and Retirement Procedures for Air National Guard and Air
Force Reserve Members). The DME reviews the case to determine whether to also restrict,
suspend, or terminate the student’s education status until review by the professional education
committee.
2.4. Students in Civilian Programs. Send any recommendations to remove the education
status of students in civilian programs through AFIT Healthcare Education Division to
AFPC/DPAME.
   2.4.1. Affiliated Programs. For programs that are closely affiliated with civilian programs
   (for example, USAF Medical Center Wright-Patterson), the due process procedures of the
   ACGME recognized program or institution should be followed. The military facility DME
   should ensure that the sponsoring institutions due process procedures are comparable to this
   instruction.
   2.4.2. A military resident being separated from the military also terminates them from the
   civilian program.
2.5. Documentation. The DME keeps records of all requirements and actions under this section
in the student’s education record.
2.6. USAFSAM. Restrict, suspend, or terminate students enrolled in these courses according to
the directives of the USAFSAM.

Section 2B—Processing Requests for Resignation

2.7. Processing for Individual Request. The process below applies to students enrolled in Air
Force education program. Students in programs outside the Air Force follow similar procedures
through AFIT Healthcare Education Division.
   2.7.1. Student Request. Students send a written request to the program director for
   permission to resign from a program.
   2.7.2. Request Approval. The program director endorses and forwards the request to the
   DME. The program director:

       acknowledgment of its receipt from the student.
       2.7.2.7. Identifies whether the student is able to provide independent care as a general
       medical officer or flight surgeon
2.8. Review. The professional education committee reviews the case, recommends approval or
disapproval, and forwards it to through the DME to the medical facility commander.
2.9. Commander Review. The medical facility commander either disapproves the request or
sends it with a recommendation for approval to AFPC/DPAM (with a copy to the student’s
major command).
2.10. Final Approval. Resignation becomes effective when AFPC/DPAM approves it.
2.11. Consequences of Resignation. Students who resign from programs required for
professional practice in the Air Force (e.g. PGY1 residents who resign prior to meeting licensing
requirements) may be involuntarily separated or may have to perform service in an alternate
career field. Physicians at PG-2 or above whose resignation is approved or who are terminated
from their program will be referred to Physician Utilization for Assignment. Due to the
complexities associated with resignation, training programs should contact the appropriate
branch of AFPC/DPAM to best inform the trainee of the potential impact of resigning from
training.

   3.14.2. Structure: Application of GDE activities within the structure of AFI 41-117 may
   vary based on GDE location and the scope of GDE activities. GDE programs will consult
   with the DME to define the relationship between GDE and GME.
   3.14.3. Policies: GDE programs will model policies such as Due Process, Resident Training
   Agreements, Supervision Policy, Grievance Policy, etc after existing GME policies within
   the institution. GDE leadership within the facility, as per prearranged relationship within
   GME structure, would ensure compliance for dental programs for resident base and facility
   orientation, resident evaluations, reports, curriculum development, dental professional
   education committee/function activities, annual program review, maintenance of resident
   files, and coordination of externships/clerkships/elective rotations. Program Directors or
   Dental Education administrative leadership provides primary oversight for Dental Education
   Programs and coordinates attendance of staff and residents at professional meetings/courses.
   3.14.4. General. The American Dental Association Commission on Dental Accreditation
   accredits all American Dental Association recognized Air Force-sponsored dental education

      prosthetics, maxillofacial reconstruction, facial esthetics, temporomandibular joint
      surgery, and temporomandibular disorders. USAF needs determine the type and numbers
      of specialty selections in compliance with current HPERB standards. Program Directors
      are selected by the Dental Executive Board and must at minimum, meet specialty board
      certification requirements as stated in applicable CODA standards.
      3.14.5.3. AFIT sponsored programs provide training not available at Air Force
      installations or if the Air Force needs exceed Air Force capabilities. Students may earn a
      masters degree, if available, provided they could finish formal course work without
      extending the length of the residency program.
   3.14.6. Special Duties and Responsibilities of Senior Residents. Senior residents are in their
   final year of training. They report directly to the service or section chief and also perform
   special staff duties. They assume increased responsibility, both in treating patients and
   instructing and supervising other residents and postgraduate students. The service or section
   chiefs give them opportunities to work with, organize, and administer other services or
   sections.

   AFHPSP, USUHS and medical AFROTC educational delay students at the discretion of the
   medical facility commander. Civilian students of the health professions attending programs
   at accredited civilian institutions may also perform externships and clerkships at Air Force
   facilities, provided that a properly executed affiliation agreement has been approved as
   required by AFI 41-108, Training Affiliation Agreement. The DME coordinates and manages
   externships, clerkships, and elective rotations.
   3.19.2. A training affiliation agreement (TAA) is not required for AFHPSP students on their
   annual active duty tour (see AFI 41-110). However, if these students attend an Air Force
   facility as a civilian student, a TAA between the student’s training institution and the Air
   Force facility is required.
   3.19.3. Clerkships. A clerkship is a formally organized period of training with a specific
   curriculum and objectives designed to give the students experience, knowledge, and skills in
   a specific area. Usually, only students in their third or fourth year of professional training are
   eligible for clerkships. The clerkship is a highly structured educational experience that
   enables the staff or faculty to judge the students ability to put learning into practice; take on
   responsibility; and continue to develop. A clerkship usually receives academic credit from
   the student’s professional school. Clerkships can only occur at training sites and have a
   properly executed affiliation agreement.
   3.19.4. Application Procedures. Students apply to the programs by contacting the DME
   office at the facility where they desire training. If the students are civilian sponsored through
   AFIT they must coordinate with AFIT Healthcare Division prior to contacting the AF
   facility.
   3.19.5. Evaluation Reports. The immediate supervisor must prepare an AF Form 494 for
   students and residents completing an externship, clerkship, or elective rotation at Air Force
   medical facilities. The Program Director must endorse AF Form 494. Special evaluation
   forms and reports from the students school must also be completed if required by that
   institution. The Program Director will send copies of AF Form 494 to AFPC/DPAM and
   AFIT/CIM.
   3.19.6. Student Restrictions. Military students and residents performing externships,
   clerkships, or elective rotations must be on official orders. Civilian students (or AFHPSP
   students attending in civilian status) performing clerkships or externships at Air Force
   medical facilities must do so at no expense to the Government.
AFI41-117 13 OCTOBER 2011                                                                      39


Section 3C—Establishment of New Programs and Program Closure

3.20. Need Identification. A USAF organization contemplating establishing a new formal
training program (not continuing health education) must first determine whether there is an
ongoing AF requirement for such training, whether the facility has the patient population and
resources available to provide such training and whether providing such training at an AF facility
is in the best interests of the AFMS. In some circumstances, it will be more cost effective to
utilize existing civilian programs to provide the training.
   3.20.1. MEDNEEDS Study. The facility commander documents the need for a new program
   by conducting a medical necessity evaluation and economic documentation system
   (MEDNEEDS) study. The requesting facility should contact AFPC/DPAM for guidance on
   the recommended format of the MEDNEEDS study. In the study:
       3.20.1.1. Evaluate the facility capability.
       3.20.1.2. Outline a proposed program curriculum.
       3.20.1.3. Estimate the number of faculty and ancillary personnel required.
       3.20.1.4. Estimate the number of students to be trained.
       3.20.1.5. Review any written documentation on the course (that is, essentials of approved
       residencies, phase 2 training plan, and so forth) to ensure that the program will
       adequately meet requirements.
   3.20.1.6. Develop a budget for the program, estimating the costs involved in maintaining the
   program.
   3.20.1.7. Outline the anticipated benefits to the Air Force by having such training at this
   facility.
   3.20.2. Formal Approval. Requests for new programs should be reviewed by the DME prior
   to approval by the facility commander. The facility commander forwards the MEDNEEDS
   study to AFPC/DPAM who provides additional recommendations to USAF/SG. Once
   USAF/SG has approved establishment of the program, the facility commander requests
   formal approval from the appropriate civilian accrediting agency, if the program is an
   accredited discipline. The DME sends a copy of all correspondence and accreditation
   application documents to AFPC/DPAM.
3.21. Accreditation.
   3.21.1. MC and DC Residency Programs. Apply for accreditation through the Accreditation
   Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or American Dental Association (ADA)
   Commission on Dental Accreditation.
   3.21.2. BSC and NC Specialties. Apply for accreditation through the appropriate specialty
   board or organization.
   3.21.3. After provisional accreditation, the program may be initiated or continued. The
   DME sends a copy of all correspondence with the accrediting agency to AFPC/DPAM. A
   copy of the letter or certificate of accreditation goes into the annual self-study.
 40                                                            AFI41-117 13 OCTOBER 2011

program in permissive TDY status, provided CHE credit is awarded. They must pay for their
own travel expenses, registration fees, tuition, and other expenses.
   4.16.1. The local medical facility commander may approve permissive TDY of fewer than
   30 days for CHE, depending on the needs of the facility. Do not approve permissive TDY in
   conjunction with a PCS to enter an AFIT sponsored graduate education program if the
   courses are a required part of the curriculum of the training program the officer is about to
   enter.
   4.16.2. The MAJCOM is responsible for approving permissive TDYs of 30 to 90 days.
   4.16.3. The MAJCOM recommends permissive TDYs of more than 90 days; AFPC/DPAM

             MEDICAL EXECUTIVE SKILL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
               IMPLEMENTATION OF DOD INSTRUCTION 6000.15,
              JOINT MEDICAL EXECUTIVE SKILL DEVELOPMENT
                               PROGRAM

Section 5A—Policy.

5.1. Policy. In 1996, the service medical departments and the Office of the Assistant Secretary
of Defense, Health Affairs (OASD/HA) jointly formulated a core curriculum to assist in the
individual development of the executive skills needed by medical treatment facility (MTF)
commanders, lead agents, and lead agent staffs.

Section 5B—Implementation

5.2. The Joint Medical Executive Skill Development Group (JMESD). The JMESD
develops policy guidance, provides oversight of policy implementation and recommends
necessary resource allocations to ensure that prospective MTF commanders, lead agents, and
lead agent candidates demonstrate the required professional administrative skills.
5.3. Competency Validation. The AFMS prepares officers to be MTF commanders and lead
agents through a progressive series of career enhancing duty assignments and educational
experiences in an effort to develop leadership skills and professional competencies (see Core
Competencies: https://jmesi.army.mil). The AFMS will ensure compliance using three
validation pathways:
   5.3.1. Completion of military or civilian courses.
   5.3.2. Experience or duty assignment.
   5.3.3. External civilian certification.
5.4. Air Force Central Screening Board. The Air Force Command Screening Board (CSB),
the colonel assignment match process, and the competency validation plan ensure that officers
selected for command of MTFs or as TRICARE Lead Agents demonstrate executive skill
competency. The Medical Squadron Screening Board (MSSB) is modeled after the CSB process
and is designed to identify individuals competent to command at an intermediate level as a
squadron commander.
