This MESL compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting.
It applies to all RC-135S ACC units, to include deployed locations. This Addendum does not
apply to Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve Command units and members. Maintain
official records created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with (IAW) AFMAN
33-363, Management of Records, and dispose of records IAW the AF Records Disposition
Schedule located at the AF Records Information Management System link

Change of Publication, to the OPR at HQ ACC/A4C, 219 Dodd Blvd, Langley AFB VA 23665.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Mission columns
have been changed. Numerous systems Work Unit Codes (WUCs) have been added or deleted.
Remarks are incorporated for each applicable WUC and have replaced notes to better clarify
mission capability requirements.
1.General.The MESL is the basis of status reporting IAW AFI 21-103. MESLs lay the ground
work for reporting the status of aircraft availability. They list the minimum essential systems and
subsystems that must work on an aircraft for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime,
         2                                                AFI21-103_ACCSUP_ADD_I 9 FEBRUARY 2011


        training, test or other missions. MESLs are not comprehensive WUC lists and are not intended
        to mirror Minimum Equipment
        Lists. Mission Ready Available (MRA) is used in readiness Status of Resources and Training
        System (SORTS) reporting only and denotes Mission Capable (MC) aircraft capable of being
        configured for a contingency mission IAW COMACC OMNIBUS Plan.
        1.1.Qualifying notes are used to define aircraft exceptions and help explain complex degraded
        mission systems.
        1.2.Aircraft status for generation and deployment: The goal is to generate or deploy Fully
        Mission Capable (FMC) aircraft, recognizing status actually achieved may be less than FMC. A
        Not Mission Capable (NMC) aircraft may be deployed provided it is safe for flight and can be
        configured and generated to MRA status at an employment site.
        1.3.All ACC units will generate, or deploy and regenerate, using ACC MESLs. Major Command
        differences in MESLs are acknowledged. Upon actual deployment to another MAJCOM theater,
        the gaining MAJCOM has the responsibility to resource and specify the unit's requirements and
        resource the differences in support/mission equipment.
        1.4.Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by WUC against the
        Full System List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems Lists (BSLs) across the page. Each
        unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement determines applicability of BSL columns.
        The aircraft MESLs incorporate all ACC assigned aircraft and therefore it is important to
        compare only those columns listed in the MESL which are applicable to the unit's assigned
        aircraft. For example, units with CC (wartime) coded aircraft would determine and report status
        using only the FSL and BSL columns related to their DOC statement. Units with TF (training)
        coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and TNG columns , and
        units with CB (test) coded aircraft would determine and report status using only the FSL and
        TST columns. Units with multiple coded aircraft will ensure status is reported using the MESL
        columns appropriate to the individual aircraft assignment code.
