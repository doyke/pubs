              Do you face concerns of unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment?
Unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment are contrary to good order and discipline and counterproductive to
combat readiness and mission accomplishment.

Active duty military, their family members, retirees, and civil service employees may address their concerns through the
Equal Opportunity Office when inappropriate or unwarranted behavior occurs because of, or is based on, their race,
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, physical/mental disability, or sexual harassment.

Civilian complaints must be filed within 45-days of the alleged occurrence (IAW AFI 36-2706)
