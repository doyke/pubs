This instruction implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-2, Inspector General--The Inspection
System. It establishes a Self-Inspection Program (SIP) for the 442d Fighter Wing (442 FW). It provides
a systematic reporting procedure enabling commanders and supervisors to identify, track and resolve
anticipated or actual problem areas. This system identifies the utilization of the Self-Inspection Tracking
System (SITS) located on the Performance Planning web site on the 442 FW Intranet page as an effective
communication process through command channels to ensure compliance of common core elements. Use
of the SITS program will provide immediate update information to commanders, supervisors and
self-inspection monitors. It applies to all members assigned to 442 FW.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. The revision designates
applicable policy directive. Attachment 2 has been added for sample of appointment memorandum and
Attachment 5 designates a wing self-inspection status log.


1. General. Self-inspection is an internal tool commanders at all levels use to assess processes. It is an
integral part of every commander's Management Control Program (MCP) and will be documented in each
commander's annual Statement of Assurance (SOA) and annotate completion on the local area network
(LAN)-based wing self-inspection status log, Attachment 5. There is no requirement to up-channel dis-
crepancies discovered in the annual self-inspection (SI). When the ability to resolve a discrepancy is
beyond the capability of the unit commander, the issue will be raised to the next level of command.

2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. Commanders, supervisors and designated SI monitors are responsible for the overall manage-
   ment of the SIP and ensuring compliance with this instruction.
2                                                                       442FWI90-201 5 MARCH 2004


    2.2. The 442 FW Commander will appoint in writing, a primary and alternate 442 FW self-inspection
    monitor. The Operations, Maintenance, Mission Support and Medical Squadron Group Commanders
    will appoint a primary and alternate SI monitors (Attachment 2) to assist the designated monitors
    within their assigned group. Squadron commanders appoint primary and alternate SI monitors for
    their squadrons and it is highly recommended they appoint additional SI monitors for individual
    flights or work centers.
    2.3. Ensure assigned units conduct SIs no later than 31 July of each year and document in the annual
    SOA. Ensure discrepancies beyond unit control are documented in the SOA and elevated to the next
    level of command.

3. Procedures
    3.1. Annual SIs will be performed and documented on the LAN-based wing SI status log by 31 July
    or as directed.
    3.2. Discrepancies will be identified and entered into the SITS to document, track and ensure closure
    of identified discrepancies.
    3.3. Documentation of all program requirements is required.
    3.4. As a back up, each appointed SI monitor is required to maintain a SI logbook. This logbook can
    be hard copy or disk but must be accessible for review by unit leadership. All closed discrepancies
    can be purged after one year of closure. Privileged information must be safeguarded in accordance
    with directives. The logbook contains the following:
       3.4.1. Section I, UNIT GUIDANCE: Table of contents, appointment memorandums, 442 FWI
       90-201 and optional unit operating instructions (OI).
       3.4.2. Section II, SELF-INSPECTION CHECKLISTS: SI or Commanders Common Core or unit
       compliance inspection (UCI) Checklists as applicable to the SI monitor’s level of responsibility.
       3.4.3. Section III, DISCREPANCIES: Reports of discrepancies discovered through any means of
       inspections, staff assistance, or a self-review process. Use Attachment 4, SI Discrepancies, as a
       back up copy to SITS. Keep this audit trail of all open discrepancies until closure. This should
       include follow-up date, current status, office of primary responsibility and estimated completion
       date.
       3.4.4. Section IV, PREVIOUS REPORTS: Applicable excerpts of all discrepancies identified
       during previous inspection reports, UCI, operational readiness inspection (ORI), or a numbered
       Air Force (NAF) staff assistance visit (SAV) to the SI monitor’s level of responsibility. Review
       those discrepancies during annual review to ensure correction and that checklists have been
       updated to prevent recurrence. Destroy when no longer needed.
       3.4.5. Section V, CROSSFEED/CROSSTELL: Copies of crossfeed/crosstell newsletters,
       excerpts or reports of other units UCI reports as applicable to the SI monitor’s level of responsibil-
       ity. Benchmarking data may be filed in this section.
       3.4.6. Section VI, SPECIAL INTEREST ITEMS: List of current Special Interest Items (SII) and
       complete SII instruction or checklist that applies directly to SI monitor’s responsibility.

      3.4.7. Section VII, EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT: Use this section for copies of
