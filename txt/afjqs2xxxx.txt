1. PURPOSE. As directed by AFI 20-112, Logistics Readiness Squadron Quality Assurance
Program, this AFJQS identifies the minimum training required to become a qualified LRS QA
evaluator (both military and civilian). This AFJQS will be available in Training Business Area
(TBA) and must be used to develop the Master Training Plan (MTP) for the LRS QA Section
(LGLOQ) and the Individual Training Plans (ITP) for evaluators. Specific applicability of this
AFJQS to ANG personnel is addressed in AFI 20-112. This AFJQS will remain in effect until
superseded or rescinded.

2. TASK QUALIFICATION. Personnel will be qualified to the GO/NO GO standard on this
AFJQS. GO means the individual can perform the task without assistance utilizing appropriate
instructions or other procedural guidance. If required training listed under Task #1 in Part II is
provided through web-based courses or trainers outside of TBA, a LGLOQ trainer will complete
the trainer’s block to document training completion. Task 1.3 is meant to be tailored training on
the 8-step problem solving process taught by the local AFSO21 office. This is not required to be
full facilitator training but rather the basics of 8-step problem solving to include root cause
analysis (4th step).

3. EVALUATOR PERSONNEL EVALUATIONS (EPE). After the LOG 143 course (Task 1.1)
is completed and on-the-job training on tasks 3.1 through 3.4 is accomplished, LRS QA
Evaluators must pass three EPEs (task 3.5) conducted by a fully qualified QA evaluator. If fully
qualified QA evaluators don’t reside in the LRS, the QA Manager will work with the local MXG
QA section for assistance with necessary training. Each QA evaluator, permanent or augmentee,
must pass the EPEs prior to performing unsupervised evaluations and inspections. At a
minimum, a qualified evaluator must ensure that the inspector can execute the proper steps to
conduct an evaluation. QA augmentees require an annual EPE on either a PE or technical
inspection to remain qualified.

4. TRAINING DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINER/CERTIFIER IDENTIFICATION.
Document training required on this AFJQS in accordance with AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training
                                                1
Program and the TBA procedural guide available in the TBA application. For civilians,
document civilian training on AF Form 971. All trainers and certifiers authorized to sign off
tasks in Part II of this AFJQS will be identified in TBA. Per AFI 36-2201, paragraph 6.9.8.1,
critical tasks in this particular AFJQS are defined as those tasks requiring third party
certification. Third party certification will be performed by the QA Manager who will sign off
as the certifying official in TBA. If a military trainee is assigned an additional duty or task not
included in an individual’s CFETP or this AFJQS, the supervisor will add these tasks to the MTP
and ITP. Specific CFETP tasks that an evaluator is authorized to evaluate will be identified in
the evaluator’s ITP. Specific AFSC QA training tasks for each AFSC may be added to the
applicable CFETP by the individual Career Field Manager (CFM).

5. This AFJQS has been coordinated with all applicable CFMs. Overall POC for this AFJQS is
