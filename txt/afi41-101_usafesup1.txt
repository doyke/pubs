Supersedes AFI41-101/U1, 9 July 1996                                                        Pages: 5

Supplement AFI 41-101, 1 April 1996, as follows:
This supplement applies to US Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) units. It does not apply to US Air Force
Reserve and Air National Guard Units.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This supplement deletes USAFE Form 234, Medical Care Received from Civilian Sources, identifies
parameters for receiving civilian care at geographical separated units (GSU) and embassies (paragraph
2.3.1.); updates approving claim officials (paragraph 3.5.3.); changes the financial reporting parameters
for single catastrophic medical cases (paragraph 3.9.3.); and deletes monthly emergency medical care
reports. Material is substantially changed from the previous edition and should be reviewed in its entirety.
2.3.1. Active duty members assigned to a GSU or embassy may receive primary medical and dental care
for up to $500 from local civilian providers and facilities. Coordinate and seek approval for approve care
expected to exceed $500 with the supporting medical treatment facility (MTF) to determine the most
effective source.
3.1.1. The closest Air Force MTF normally will process and pay VA or civilian emergency medical
claims, including GSU primary and emergent care. Attachment 3 (Added) details processing procedures
for emergency medical claims for MTFs and GSUs, including primary care for GSUs.
3.1.3. Supporting MTFs are accountable for tracking, processing, and analyzing emergency medical and
dental claims in their AOR. MTFs may designate GSUs with health benefit advisors and embassies with
support staff the authority to process OCONUS medical claims directly to the fiscal intermediary. The
host MTF still retains overall management and accountability of the program. For those GSUs or embas-
sies lacking adequate administrative support, the host MTF is required to process all claims.

3.1.3.1. (Added) The Command Surgeon’s Financial Management Branch (HQ USAFE/SGSR) will
establish an annual target for emergency medical and dental claims for each MTF. MTFs will not have
direct control over the funds; however, they will continue to exercise a financial interest in the manage-
ment of the program.
3.1.3.2. (Added) HQ USAFE/SGSR will establish MTF targets each fiscal year after initial validation
with Air Staff (HQ USAF/SGMC).
3.1.3.3. (Added) MTFs should analyze the Wisconsin Physician Services Foreign Active Claims Spread-
sheet on a monthly basis, located at website http://sg.usafe.af.mil. To access the spreadsheet click Group,
and then click SGSR-financial management.
3.2.1.2. Approval and Payment Process. MTFs are exempt from the claims pricing requirement as stated
in the Supplemental Health Care Program, CHAMPUS Manual, Volume II, Chapter 3, Section 6.6.
3.5.1. The contracted fiscal intermediary ultimately will pay all approved OCONUS claims. The local
accounting and finance office must process all CONUS claims by using a HQ USAFE/SGSR fund cite.
Request the fund cite from HQ USAFE/SGSR by making notification of a claim to include patient’s
name, social security number, date of incidence, diagnosis, and total expenditure.
3.5.1.2. (Added) Notify HQ USAFE/SGSR of each subsequent CONUS claim to include patient’s name,
social security account number, date of incident, and total expenditure.
3.5.3. The following individuals are authorized to approve payment of civilian medical and dental care
claims.
3.5.3.1. For Supporting MTFs: flight commander, business operations; flight commander, medical
resource management; flight commander, TRICARE; medical support commander; hospital or clinic
administrator; or director, base medical services.
3.5.3.2. For other MTFs, medical aid stations, embassies, and GSUs: director, base medical services;
medical support commander; or local commander.
3.9.3. Unusual or Difficult Cases. In the event of a catastrophic case for single episodes of medical care
exceeding $30,000, submit notification to HQ USAFE/SGSR.
