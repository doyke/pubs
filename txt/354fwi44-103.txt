Terms
Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)— The act of providing respiratory ventilation and
heart (cardiac) compression by an external source. This most commonly is provided to an
individual who is without both spontaneous respiration and heartbeat, and is provided by
someone capable of performing the required mechanical action.
Emergency Medical Services (EMS)— The term used to describe the rapid response team of
medically trained personnel to provide emergency medical assistance as necessary.
Basic Life Support (BLS)— A training program that teaches basic CPR techniques as well as
AED use.
Automated External Defibrillator (AED)— A defibrillator device that is used to provide
electrical stimulation to the heart during sudden cardiopulmonary arrest.
Defibrillation— The application of an electric shock, via a defibrillator, directly through a
person’s chest.
Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA)— SCA occurs when the heart fibrillates -- a chaotic, abnormal
electrical activity of the heart, which causes the heart to quiver in an uncontrollable fashion.
Medical Emergency— When circumstances exist whereby the behavior of an individual leads a
reasonable person to believe that the individual is experiencing a life-threatening condition that
requires an immediate medical response.
Federal Building— A building or portion of a building owned, leased or rented by a federal
agency, which includes buildings on military installations of the United States.

                   TRAUMATIC STRESS RESPONSE INFORMATION

A5.1. What is traumatic stress response? It is a comprehensive system of crisis intervention
designed to assist individuals and groups affected by traumatic events (natural disasters, terrorist
events, suicides, and death--either accidental or intentional).
A5.2. What events could initiate a request for TSR services? Many types of events have the
potential to produce individual and community traumatic stress. Events include: large scale
disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc.) and small-scale disasters (suicide, death or near-
death of coworker, workplace violence event, etc.). TSR services will be provided after
traumatic events to help those who have experienced the events. The goal is to assist those
affected by traumatic events to cope with the normal stress reaction in an effective manner.
These actions are intended to minimize the impact of exposure to these events and prevent or
mitigate permanent disability if possible.
A5.3. What is the procedure for requesting TSR services? The office of record for TSR
services is the Mental Health clinic (377-3071). Please address any inquiries about TSR services
to the Chief of the TSR team.
