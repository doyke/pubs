                                                 Chapter 2

                                   GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Base Civil Engineer (BCE). The BCE, at the direction of the Base Facilities Board, is responsible
for operating, maintaining, repairing, and constructing AF real property and real property installed equip-
ment (RPIE) to accomplish the mission most economically. The following are more specific BCE respon-
sibilities:
    2.1.1. Assignment, transfer, or termination of the use or occupancy of real property facilities under
    the control of Scott AFB.
    2.1.2. Monitor and control space used within buildings and the use of other base real property assets
    by AF and associated activities.
    2.1.3. Custody of vacant real property facilities for which the obligated organization has been given a
    formal release.
    2.1.4. Maintain capability to correct any emergency condition 24-hours a day.
    2.1.5. Provide reliable utilities to meet readiness requirements, maintain quality of life, and satisfy
    installation needs.
    2.1.6. Provide base support services (i.e., pest control, grounds maintenance, refuse, etc.).
    2.1.7. Accomplish work requirements with available resources quickly and establish standards to
    address quality, customers’ needs, and mission requirements.
    2.1.8. Establish a system to provide customers with the means to accomplish work requirements
    using their own resources, such as labor, materials, equipment, or funds.

2.2. Organizational Commanders/Agency Chiefs. Organizational commanders/agency chiefs assume
responsibility for the care, custody, and protection of all facilities assigned to the organization by the
Facilities Board. Ownership responsibilities will end only when the Base Real Property Office has pro-
vided the obligated organization written notice to that effect. The following are more specific commander/
agency chief responsibilities:
    2.2.1. The commander or agency chief must designate, in writing, a primary and alternate facility
    manager for each building assigned to the organization. Facility managers must be an officer, NCO, or
    civilian with at least 12-months retainability and sufficient authority and ability to perform their
    assigned duties. Facility managers should serve a minimum term of 12 months to ensure program con-
    tinuity and minimize disruption to facility occupants due to frequent facility manager changes. When
    practical, facility managers should work in the facility or close proximity to the facility where they are
    an appointed manager. A copy of the appointment letter must be forwarded to CE Customer Service,
    375 CES/CEOC, and should include all information listed on Attachment 2, Facility Manager’s
    Appointment Letter.
       2.2.1.1. In multipurpose facilities, the user with the most floor space is defined as the major user.
       Major users must appoint a primary and alternate facility manager for the overall facility. Other
       organizations must appoint alternate facility managers responsible for their unit’s portion of the
       facility. Alternates can process actions for their respective units through CE, but they should coor-
       dinate work requests with the major user/primary facility manager. By doing so, the primary facil-
SCOTTAFBPAM32-1001 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                         9


       ity manager will be able to keep track of what is planned and being accomplished for the overall
       facility.
   2.2.2. Commanders must ensure that no facility alterations, additions, or construction is accomplished
   without prior CE approval on AF IMT 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request. Civil Engineering
   approves all work in real property facilities, regardless of the method of accomplishment. Therefore,
   work that is to be accomplished by self-help or contract by requester (i.e., AF IMT 9, Request for
   Purchase, Government Purchase Card (GPC), etc.) requires CE approval.
   2.2.3. Commanders must ensure no change is made in the use of real property without approval of the
   Facilities Board.
   2.2.4. Commanders must ensure real property and installed equipment is not removed, relocated,
   altered or otherwise changed, without prior approval from CE.
   2.2.5. Commanders must ensure vacated buildings are left in a clean condition, undamaged, except
   for fair wear-and-tear, and adjacent grounds have been properly policed, until transferred back to CE.

2.3. Facility Managers. Facility managers assume responsibility for the proper care, custody, and pro-
tection of the facilities for which they are appointed as managers. In the performance of their duties, facil-
ity managers regularly work with various CE activities to coordinate CE support. The next two sections of
this guide outline facility manager responsibilities and provide useful information for facility managers
on CE support and operations.

                             FACILITY MANAGER RESPONSIBILITIES

3.1. Appointment, Training, and Reassignment.
     3.1.1. Appointment. A primary and alternate facility manager is appointed, in writing, for each facil-
     ity or portion of a facility assigned to the organization. Facility managers must be an officer, NCO, or
     civilian equivalent, with at least 12-months retainability and sufficient authority and ability to perform
     their assigned duties. Facility managers should serve a minimum term of 12 months to ensure program
     continuity and minimize disruption to facility occupants due to frequent facility manager changes.
     Home phone or cell phone numbers for all facility managers are required in the event of an emergency
     such as a security breach, fire, or network failure. This information is protected by the Privacy Act of
     1974 and is used FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.

3.2. Training. Facility managers are responsible for attending annual training as provided by CE (manda-
tory briefing, computer-based training, etc). This training will address facility manager responsibilities, as
well as CE work procedures, priorities, and work methods. In addition to training provided by CE, outgo-
ing facility managers are required to brief new managers on the facility-specific details of their program.

3.3. Reassignment. Facility managers are responsible for submitting new facility manager appointment
letters to CE Customer Service, 375 CES/CEOC, 30 days prior to any change. This will allow sufficient
time for the outgoing facility manager to transfer facility-specific training information/documentation to
the new facility manager.

                                                 Chapter 4

               GENERAL CARE, PROTECTION, AND MINOR MAINTENANCE.

4.1. General Care, Custody, and Protection. Facility managers are responsible for ensuring the proper
care, custody, and protection of their assigned facilities. To accomplish this, facility managers must:
   4.1.1. Brief occupants on their collective responsibilities for the care, custody, and protection of real
   property to include pecuniary liability for damage or loss due to negligence, misuse or abuse.
   4.1.2. Ensure that users of real property facilities do not tamper with, replace, repair, or adjust RPIE,
   including electrical equipment, thermostats, heating and ventilating equipment, air conditioners,
   vents, blowers, fixtures, or other installed equipment.
   4.1.3. Ensure occupants do not alter, modify, move or remove permanent water, heating, lighting,
   ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, and related fixtures or other RPIE.
   4.1.4. Assist CE, your unit commander, and others in determining financial liability and charging
   responsible persons for known or suspected cases of facility damage or abuse due to negligence, mis-
   use, or willful misconduct. Facility managers will assist in preparing a statement of charges or report
   of survey for damages to the facility and/or real property installed equipment.

4.2. Minor Maintenance. Facility managers perform minor maintenance tasks as needed to keep their
facilities, equipment, appliances, and premises in a state of repair expected of any property owner. In par-
ticular, facility managers must:
   4.2.1. Conduct monthly inspections of their facility to assess its overall condition including the pres-
   ence of mold on all surfaces, as well as the condition of doors, windows, lights, plumbing, and Heat-
   ing Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Systems. A sample facility inspection checklist is
   provided in Attachment 5, Facility Manager’s Checklist.
   4.2.2. Ensure HVAC systems are routinely inspected. Use the Facility Manager’s HVAC Inspection
   Checklist listed in Attachment 8 when complaints of excessive heat, cold, humidity, and dust in the
   facility are received. Contact CE Customer Service to place a service call to correct any problems
   noted during these inspections.
   4.2.3. Be aware of heating and cooling changeover periods. Due to vast differences in HVAC System
   designs, not all facilities have the capability to change from heating to cooling on the same day. Sev-
   eral facilities require a 30-day “no heat/no cool” changeover period in the spring and fall to allow
   HVAC technicians to perform maintenance and prepare each system for heating or cooling operations.
   The 30 day “no heat/no cool” changeover period will vary depending on long-term temperature
   trends, not on isolated hot or cold temperature spells. If you are not sure if your facility falls into this
   category, please contact CE Customer Service.
   4.2.4. Make minor repairs to their facilities (i.e., plunge stopped-up sinks or toilets, glue loose wall
   paper, change light bulbs/tubes, replace ceiling tiles, etc.).
   4.2.5. Change out all light bulbs/tubes that are 10 feet high and under. Facility managers are respon-
   sible for purchasing and stocking small supplies of standard light bulbs/tubes. CE changes out lights
   above 10 feet or lights located in hazardous locations (such as stairwell) with user-provided light

     bulbs/tubes. Exception: CE provides and replaces specialty lights such as street lights, high level
     hangar lighting, emergency lighting, etc.
     4.2.6. Accomplish minor owner/user mold remediation as needed. Minor owner/user mold remedia-
     tion involves cleaning mold from surfaces using rubber gloves, a sponge or steel wool, and a bucket
     of warm soapy water or 10 percent bleach solution at facility manager’s discretion. When minor
     owner/user mold remediation fails to keep the problem from spreading, submit an AF IMT 332 to CE
     Customer Service for evaluation. All corrective facility work, if any, will be subject to the availability
     of funds.
     4.2.7. Identify and report all other facility or real property installed equipment repairs to CE Cus-
     tomer Service.

                                     INTERNAL HOUSEKEEPING

Facility managers are responsible for ensuring the following internal housekeeping duties are accom-
plished:

5.1. Custodial Contract Duties. If contracted janitorial services are provided in your facility, facility man-
agers are responsible for:
   5.1.1. Obtaining a copy of all custodial contract information pertaining to your facility from CE’s
   Custodial Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE). This information will include a copy of the statement
   of work, and if available, a facility floor plan outlining the areas covered under the contract and the
   level of service. If facility changes occur that affect the areas to be serviced due to facility alterations
   or portions of the facility being vacated during a facility renovation, facility managers must notify the
   Custodial Contract QAE so adjustments can be made to the contract.
   5.1.2. Monitoring and inspecting all services provided and reporting any discrepancies through
   appropriate channels. Building occupants must up-channel complaints through the facility manager.
   In turn, the facility manager contacts the janitorial service supervisor and gives them the opportunity
   to try to resolve the discrepancy. If the discrepancy cannot be resolved, the facility manager contacts
   CE’s Custodial QAE to work the issue.
   5.1.3. Requesting custodial contract changes by submitting an AF IMT 332 to CE Customer Service.
   The request will be forwarded to the Custodial Contract QAE for a cost estimate. The requested
   change, along with the cost estimate, is forwarded to the 375 CES/CEO, Operations Flight Com-
   mander, for approval consideration. Approval of contract changes often hinge upon the availability of
   funds.
   5.1.4. For facilities not covered under the contract, facility managers are responsible for ensuring the
   occupants regularly dispose of trash and clean their facility as needed.

5.2. Recycling Duties. Facility managers are responsible for ensuring recyclable materials are properly
collected, prepared, sorted, and delivered to facility recycling collection points or the base recycling cen-
ter. If a recycling monitor is appointed, the facility manager works with the recycling monitor to ensure
these tasks are accomplished. More information on recycling is covered in the Environmental Awareness
Section of this pamphlet.

5.3. Housekeeping Duties. Finally, facility managers are responsible for ensuring occupants employ good
housekeeping practices to prevent fire/safety hazards and to minimize the attraction of pests.

                                                Chapter 6

                               EXTERNAL HOUSEKEEPING DUTIES

Facility managers are responsible for ensuring the following external housekeeping duties are accom-
plished:

6.1. Grounds Maintenance/Protection Duties. Contract grounds maintenance is provided to most facilities
on Scott AFB; however, facility managers and building occupants are responsible for the general upkeep
of the grounds surrounding their facilities. To ensure the grounds around their facilities are properly main-
tained, facility managers will:
     6.1.1. Purchase, stock, and maintain a small supply of trash bags, brooms, rakes, snow shovels, etc.,
     as needed to carry out their responsibilities.
     6.1.2. Establish and carry out periodic policing details to keep the grounds, sidewalks, curbs, and
     pavements surrounding the facility free from trash and unsightly debris IAW SCOTTAFBI 32-1004,
     Maintenance of Structures and Grounds.
     6.1.3. Ensure occupants do not carry out any digging without a CE approved AF IMT 103, Base Civil
     Engineering Work Clearance Request. Personnel will be held financially liable for all damage
     resulting from unauthorized or careless digging (i.e., ignoring precautionary measures on an approved
     AF IMT 103).
     6.1.4. Enforce parking instructions as required.
     6.1.5. Keep vehicles and related equipment off grass to prevent ruts and damage to underground
     sprinkler systems or utilities.
     6.1.6. Monitor contracted grass cutting, tree trimming, leave raking, and irrigation services provided
     and report any concerns or discrepancies to CE’s Grounds Maintenance QAE.

6.2. Snow Removal Duties. In accordance with AFOSHSTD 91-501, Air Force Consolidated Occupa-
tional Safety Standard, and Scott AFB Snow and Ice Plan, facility managers are responsible for:
     6.2.1. Removing snow and ice from sidewalks, stairs, entryways, and fire hydrants and for putting
     down sufficient grit/deicing material to allow safe facility access or evacuation.
     6.2.2. Purchasing and stocking a small supply of “approved” deicing material. The Self-Help Store
     may provide limited quantities of deicing material to facility managers when funds are available.
     6.2.3. Coordinating the clearance of parking lots when required to enable effective snow plow opera-
     tions.

6.3. Refuse Contract Duties. In support of the refuse or trash collection contract, facility managers are
responsible for:
     6.3.1. Ensuring recyclable materials, hazardous materials, oversized items (i.e., pallets, furniture,
     appliances, etc.), construction waste, cement/concrete, etc., are not placed in dumpsters.
     6.3.2. Ensuring areas around dumpsters are kept clean and accessible to trash collection vehicles.

                                             PEST CONTROL

Facility managers will:

7.1. Ensure occupants employ facility management practices that minimize rodent and insect attractions
such as good housekeeping and proper storage/disposal of food.

7.2. Utilize approved self-help materials and methods to control minor infestations of pests that do not
pose a significant health hazard or destroy AF property.
     7.2.1. These pests include: cockroaches, ants (except carpenter ants), centipedes, crickets, earwigs,
     firebrats, flies, silverfish, sow bugs, mice, and miscellaneous flying and crawling insects. It includes
     minor infestations of fire ants, wasps, and wasp nests as well.
     7.2.2. Pesticides and mouse traps are available at the Base Self-Help Store, Bldg 57. Self-help meth-
     ods must be used for 30 days before CE will respond. If no self-help measures were used, facility
     managers will be instructed to use self-help methods first.

7.3. Request CE pest control support when:
     7.3.1. The pests pose a significant health hazard. These pests include rats, snakes, other wild animals,
     and large bees/wasp nests.
     7.3.2. The pests can destroy AF property. These pests include termites, carpenter ants, and wood bor-
     ing beetles.
     7.3.3. Self-help methods fail to control nonhazardous and nondestructive pests within 30 days.

                            EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

This action is an integrated program to coordinate and organize efforts to manage, prepare for, respond to,
and recover from the direct and indirect consequences of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and
explosives; terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), conventional weapon attacks, major
accidents, and natural disasters.

8.1. Unit EM representatives receive training from CE’s Readiness Flight. These representatives work
with their unit control centers (UCC), facility managers, and unit personnel, act as a liaison between their
unit and 375 CES/CEX, ensure the unit provide functional support to the installation EM program, and
provide disaster information to unit personnel.

8.2. Under the EM program, facility managers are responsible for:
   8.2.1. Establishing facility-specific warning and notification procedures to quickly relay information
   and implement facility-level EM actions as needed.
   8.2.2. Implementing all facility-level response actions as outlined in all applicable base checklists.
   The following paragraphs cover some facility manager responsibilities under the most common
   checklists facility managers respond to including natural disaster/severe weather checklists, force pro-
   tection condition (FPCON) checklists, and shelter-in-place (SIP) checklists.
   8.2.3. Natural Disaster/Severe Weather Checklist. As a facility manager, you are responsible for noti-
   fying facility occupants on the procedures they need to follow before, during, and after severe weather
   storms (windstorms, tornados, extreme cold, etc). Additionally, facility managers are responsible for
   ensuring facility-level response actions are implemented and completion is reported to their UCC (if
   activated).
   8.2.4. FPCON Checklists. Facility managers are responsible for being familiar with all facility level
   actions they are responsible for performing under each FPCON Checklist (Alpha through Delta).
   Additionally, facility managers are responsible for executing facility-level FPCON measures as
   required. Some measures include:
       8.2.4.1. Ensuring FPCON signs are posted and kept current on entry doors.

                           FACILITY SECURITY AND KEY CONTROL

9.1. Facility Security. Facility managers are responsible for:
   9.1.1. Establishing and publishing security procedures for opening and closing the facility to ensure
   the facility is secure at all times.
   9.1.2. Responding immediately to secure their facilities when found unsecured.
   9.1.3. Maintaining positive key control.
   9.1.4. Executing facility-level FPCON measures as required under the EM Program.

9.2. Key Control. Facility managers are accountable for the security of all keys servicing their facilities,
and they must establish security procedures to ensure no keys are duplicated without their personal
knowledge or approval. Specifically, facility managers will:
   9.2.1. Acknowledge receipt of and be responsible for all keys to their facility, to include the redistri-
   bution of keys to other occupants or users as directed by their commander.
   9.2.2. Establish/maintain a key control log on an AF IMT 2432, Key Issue Log, or a locally produced
   key log to account for all keys issued.
   9.2.3. Repossess all keys from holders when they PCS, retire, or terminate employment.
   9.2.4. Request duplicate keys or lock change requests on an AF IMT 332.
       9.2.4.1. CE Customer Service will only issue and accept requests for keys from the primary or
       alternate facility manager. Requests for more than five keys at a time or repeated requests for addi-
       tional keys in the same facility will be closely scrutinized by CE to determine the cause. If CE
       determines the keys are required due to a lack of key control or unit negligence, the user will be
       responsible for paying for the additional keys.
       9.2.4.2. Additionally, lock replacement requests will be closely scrutinized by CE to determine
       the cause. If new locks are requested due to lost keys or unit negligence, the user will be responsi-
       ble for funding the lock replacement requirement and all associated keys.
   9.2.5. Sign for, secure, and maintain control of facility master keys. CE will only issue two master
   keys per facility. These keys will be held and maintained by the commander and facility manager. If
   more than two master keys are required, a letter of justification signed by the unit commander must
   accompany the AF IMT 332 stating why additional master keys are required. When facility managers/
   commanders change, arrangements must be made with the CE Lock Shop to transfer responsibility of
   “master” keys from one individual to another. If a master key is lost, the individual/unit that signed for
   the key will be responsible for funding the rekeying of all locks affected.
   9.2.6. Ensure transfer of facilities from one manager to another includes a transfer of all applicable
   keys. When a unit vacates a building, the facility manager is responsible for collecting, labeling and
   turning in all keys to CE’s real property office.

                                            FIRE PREVENTION

The Fire Prevention Program is set up and maintained to ensure fire/life safety in all facilities on Scott
AFB. This task is accomplished through education and training of all personnel assigned to base facilities.
In order to achieve these goals, facility managers have a broad range of responsibilities to fulfill. The
facility manager is the point of contact for all fire-related issues within their facility. Furthermore, facility
managers are responsible to their unit commanders for the fire safe condition of their facilities. In sum-
mary, facility managers are responsible for:

10.1. Complying with fire prevention responsibilities and guidance contained in AFI 32-2001, The Fire
Protection Operations and Fire Prevention Program, and SCOTTAFBI 32-2001, Fire Prevention Pro-
gram. This includes ensuring facility occupants comply with all fire prevention directives.

10.2. Maintaining a facility fire safety folder that contains:
     10.2.1. A floor plan that identifies the locations of all fire extinguishers, exit lights, emergency lights,
     exits, and smoke/fire barriers. This floor plan is extremely useful during inspections, self-help
     projects, and fire evacuation planning.
     10.2.2. A list of fire extinguishers and locations and documentation of fire safety inspections. This
     includes facility manager inspection documentation on inspected fire extinguishers, emergency light-
     ing, exit lighting, and fire drills, as well as documentation related to thermostat calibrations and hood
     and duct cleaning in kitchen facilities.
     10.2.3. A copy of all issued AF IMT 1487, Fire Prevention Visit Reports.
     10.2.4. A copy of all open AF IMTs 332 for correcting fire deficiencies.
     10.2.5. A current copy of SCOTTAFBI 32-2001.
     10.2.6. Other fire prevention correspondence.

10.3. Accompanying the fire inspector during all scheduled, unscheduled, or no-notice inspections/visits.
After inspection, facility managers are responsible for promptly implementing corrective actions for any
fire safety deficiencies noted. When hazards and deficiencies are noted that can’t be corrected on the spot,
AF IMT 1487 will be issued.
     10.3.1. The facility manager is responsible for completing the back portion of the AF IMT 1487,
     Copy 1, stating the corrective action. Corrective actions may be an on-the-spot correction, in-house
     correction, or AF IMT 332-initiated correction. Then, Copy 1 is signed by the functional manager
     (i.e., squadron commander) and returned to the base Fire Prevention Section (375 CES/CECP) on or
     before the suspense date. Copy 2 is maintained by the facility manager in the facility fire prevention
     folder.
     10.3.2. If a serious fire hazard (Fire Safety Deficiency Code 1, 2, or 3) is not corrected within 30 days
     of discovery, the facility manager must initiate AF IMT 3, Hazard Abatement Plan, IAW AFI
     91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH)
     Standards.

10.4. Conducting monthly fire inspections of their facilities. Facility fire inspections will be documented
on an AF IMT 3130, General Purpose, or a locally developed tracking sheet. Each element of the inter-
nal fire inspection must be documented on the form/tracking sheet. The monthly fire inspection will
include the following:
   10.4.1. Inspecting fire extinguishers to ensure they are operational. Extinguishers requiring service or
   replacement must be taken to the Extinguisher Maintenance Shop for servicing and returned to their
   designated locations.
   10.4.2. Visually inspecting all installed fire alarm and detection systems, manual pull boxes, detec-
   tors, standpipes, and installed fire suppression systems to ensure all devices are not damaged,
   obstructed, or blocked.
   10.4.3. Checking fire doors and all exits to ensure they are not blocked and in good working order.
   10.4.4. Ensuring all exits are properly marked. Exit signs shall not be obstructed and self-illuminating
   signs must be kept operational.
   10.4.5. Testing of all exit lighting.
   10.4.6. Testing of all emergency lighting in administrative, storage, industrial, mercantile, health care,
   educational, and public assembly facilities. Emergency lighting must not be obstructed and should be
   designed to illuminate paths of egress.
   10.4.7. Inspecting facility electrical safety practices. Avoid the use of extension cords; however, rec-
   ommend the use of power strips. Remind personnel to power down electrical equipment if it will be
   left unattended or not used for an extended period of time (i.e., fans, heaters, window A/C units, etc.).
   10.4.8. If portable electrical heating devices are used, ensure that these devices are UL-approved and
   are fitted with an automatic tip-over shutoff switch. These devices must not be plugged into systems
   furniture, and they are not allowed for use in fuel labs, fuel cell maintenance areas, or flammable/com-
   bustible storage areas. Additionally, portable electric heating devices must be turned off and
   unplugged when not in use or left unattended.

10.5. Notifying the Fire Department Alarm Room, 256-5130, or the Fire Prevention Office, 256-7212, of
any potential fire/safety hazard or if detectors with activation lights are lit or become activated.

10.6. Ensuring fire lanes and fire hydrants are clear/unobstructed at all times, to include snow and ice
removal.

10.7. Training all facility personnel on fire reporting procedures, the location and use of fire extinguish-
ers/alarm pull boxes, fire suppression systems and emergency evacuation procedures. Document Fire Pre-
vention/Safety training on AF IMT 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, IAW AFI 91-301 or other
applicable training products.

10.8. Ensuring emergency phone number stickers are posted on all telephones. Stickers may be obtained
from the Fire Prevention Office.

10.9. Ensuring safe smoking practices are enforced and limited to designated smoking areas.

                                     ENERGY MANAGEMENT

Facility managers are responsible for emphasizing utility conservation awareness within their facilities
and supporting the base energy manager as needed. As a minimum, facility managers will:

11.1. Conserve electricity by turning off nonessential lightings during daylight hours and by turning off
equipment and appliances when not in use.

11.2. Close windows and doors during heating and cooling seasons.

11.3. Ensure office heating is set to 70 degrees. When unoccupied at night or over weekends, heating will
be set 10-15 degrees cooler.

11.4. Ensure office cooling equipment (if provided) is set to 76 degrees, unless specialized equipment
requires cooler operating temperatures based on equipment specifications/technical data.

11.5. Ensure hot water is set to 110 degrees. In dining and dishwashing facilities, hot water temperatures
are set to 140 degrees or manufacturer-recommended settings.

11.6. Upon notification of peak electrical demand, facility managers will ensure occupants decrease their
electrical loads/demand by complying with procedures outlined in SCOTTAFBI 32-1006.

                                   ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS

All operations on DoD installations must comply with environmental laws. To ensure facility-level com-
pliance, facility managers must be “environmentally aware” about the functions of CE’s Environmental
Flight, as well as the impact of their operations on the environment.

12.1. Environmental Flight functions. The following information provides insight into the functions of
CE’s Environmental Flight:
     12.1.1. Environmental Compliance. This section oversees environmental regulatory laws at the fed-
     eral, state, and local level, while addressing overall environmental quality objectives and comparing
     risk across programs. It also incorporates a planning element that is responsible for evaluating and
     assessing current and future operations, procedures, and processes as they relate to the National Envi-
     ronmental Policy Act (NEPA). The AF program that addresses NEPA compliance is the Environmen-
     tal Impact Analysis Program (EIAP). These processes function as a working group to review work
     orders, identify environmental discrepancies, and develop plans to correct environmental deficiencies.
     Training is provided to base employees to enhance environmental awareness or to increase knowledge
     and expertise.
     12.1.2. Environmental Restoration. This element administers the Installation Restoration Program
     (IRP). This element is responsible for identifying sites that were environmentally contaminated from
     past practices and implementing proper remedial actions for restoring sites. Sites are restored to allow
     for future compatible reuse. There are several restoration sites on base. IRP managers review all AF
     IMTs 332 to ensure compatible land use at these sites.
     12.1.3. Natural and Cultural Resources. This section establishes, coordinates, and maintains the Nat-
     ural Resources Management Program in compliance with local, state, and federal agencies. This pro-
     gram encompasses the management of forests, plants, fish, wildlife, and natural resource activities.
     This element also integrates historical and archeological preservation requirements through planning
     and management, while encouraging rehabilitation and adaptive use of significant historical
     resources.
     12.1.4. Pollution Prevention. The base operates a mandatory recycling program for all facilities. All
     of the following materials must be collected at your facility: paper, cardboard, magazines/newspapers,
     plastic, aluminum/steel cans, glass, toner, and inkjet cartridges, scrap metals (steel, aluminum, etc.),
     pallets. Recycling containers can be obtained from the Pollution Prevention Manager, 256-2186, Bldg
     56. The Hazardous Material Pharmacy (HAZMART) monitors, approves, and tracks all hazardous
     material purchased or consumed on the base, including those items purchased via AF IMTs 9, con-
     tracts, or GPC cards. Every hazardous material item must first obtain approval on AF IMT 3952,
     Chemical Hazardous Material Request/Authorization from the HAZMART before the item is pur-
     chased or used. A barcode will be generated and must be placed onto the item. The correct Material
     Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) and approved AF IMT 3952 must be maintained in a binder. All hazardous
     materials should be properly labeled and stored.
        12.1.4.1. The HAZMART is located in Bldg 555 and can be reached at 256-5962. HAZMART
        hours of operation are Monday through Friday, 0720-1620.
SCOTTAFBPAM32-1001 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                          25


       12.1.4.2. The Recycling Center is located in Bldg 3286 and can be reached at 256-6431. Recy-
       cling Center hours are 0730-1600, Monday through Friday, and 0800-1200 on Saturday. Regular
       facility pick-ups are serviced via a truck schedule, if additional pick-ups are required, please call.
       The Recycling Center accepts all of the following materials from all personnel with access to the
       base (including retirees): paper, cardboard, magazines/newspapers, plastic, aluminum/steel cans,
       glass, toner and inkjet cartridges, scrap metals (steel, aluminum, etc.), pallets, and appliances
       (Freon removed).
       12.1.4.3. Environmental Management System (EMS). All personnel are required to comply with
       the bases’ EMS Manual. Copies of the manual can be obtained by contacting the EMS Coordina-
       tor, 256-2186. EMS General Awareness Level Training is required of all personnel located at this
       installation (report completion to unit training manager). The training can be accessed at the fol-
       lowing website: https://private.scott.amc.af.mil/375aw/375msg/375ces/ems.

12.2. Facility-level Environmental Issues. Facility managers must be aware of facility specific environ-
mental programs and issues.
   12.2.1. Environmental Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP). Facility man-
   agers should attend annual ECAMP pre-briefs to ensure their facilities are ready for inspections.
   12.2.2. Hazardous Waste Management. Facility managers should be aware of hazardous waste man-
   agement requirements if their facilities or users store, process, or generate hazardous waste.
   12.2.3. Other Facility Environmental Issues. Facility managers should be familiar with Universal
   Waste Lamp Management procedures, as well as asbestos and lead-based paint issues. The following
   provides information on these topics:
       12.2.3.1. Universal Waste Lamp Management. This program covers EPA requirements for the
       storage, labeling, and disposal of USED florescent light bulbs/tubes/lamps that contain mercury.
       The following guidance can help users avoid an ECAMP write-up.
           12.2.3.1.1. Storage Requirements. Facility managers must establish an approved Indoor
           Accumulation Point to store used lamps. This area must be maintained and comply with all
           requirements for storing waste lamps IAW Scott AFB Hazardous Waste Management Plan.
           Used lamps must be stored in containers that are structurally sound to prevent breakage or
           leakage. Use a separate container for each type of lamp (i.e., florescent, mercury vapor, HID,
           etc.). Save and reuse the original lamp packaging when possible.
           12.2.3.1.2. Labeling/Marking. Containers must be labeled with the words “Universal Waste
           Lamps” and must be dated using the date in which the first used lamp was placed in the con-
           tainer. Additionally, containers should indicate the type of lamp, work-center name, and the
           indoor accumulation point manager’s name.
           12.2.3.1.3. Disposal. Facility managers must ensure that all used lamp containers are turned in
           to the HAZMART pharmacy within 9 months from the date the first used lamp was placed in
           the container or when containers become full (whichever occurs first).
       12.2.3.2. Asbestos Awareness/Management. Asbestos is a naturally occurring, abundant mineral
       that was used in 3500+ building products prior to 1990 due to the material being durable, a great
       insulator and fire resistant. In older facilities asbestos may be found in floor tiles, mastic (tile/car-
       pet, wallpaper adhesive), ceiling tiles, insulation, window glazing, and fire proofing barriers, etc.
26                                                  SCOTTAFBPAM32-1001 22 FEBRUARY 2007


     It is important to note that although asbestos containing materials are not as widely used as they
     were prior to 1990; asbestos materials are still used today. Asbestos only becomes a hazard when
     asbestos fibers are disturbed or released into the air where they then become an inhalation danger/
     hazard. Inhaled asbestos fibers can cause lethal respiratory diseases. Related to asbestos manage-
     ment, facility managers are responsible for the following:
        12.2.3.2.1. Ensuring that no facility work including self-help and contract by requester work
        is accomplished without CE approval on an AF IMT 332. As part of the work order process,
        CE determines if the proposed work could possibly disturb asbestos containing materials
        (based on the age of the facility, previous asbestos testing data in the affected facility, types of
        facility materials affected, etc.). If the proposed work will disturb any building materials that
        could potentially contain asbestos, CE will require asbestos testing be carried out before an
        approval decision can be made. If asbestos is confirmed, estimates are obtained to determine
        how much it will cost to accomplish the work through a certified asbestos abatement contrac-
        tor. Customers pay for all asbestos testing and abatement work if required. In some cases,
        accomplishing the work request may be cost prohibitive due to the cost of the related asbestos
        abatement work.
        12.2.3.2.2. Ensuring facility occupants do not touch, disturb, sweep, saw, drill, sand, or vac-
        uum known or suspected asbestos containing materials.
        12.2.3.2.3. Contacting CE’s Asbestos Contract QAE if facility occupants discover a potential
        asbestos hazard. Facility managers will request contract asbestos testing and/or abatement on
        AF IMT 332.
     12.2.3.3. Lead-Based Paint (LBP) Awareness. LBP was frequently used in building construction
     prior to 1978. LBP chips, peelings and airborne dust pose an inhalation and ingestion hazard.
     Inhalation and ingestion of LBP results in elevated levels of lead in the blood. Related to LBP,
     facility managers are responsible for:
        12.2.3.3.1. Ensuring that no facility paint work including self help or contract by requester
        work is accomplished without CE approval on AF IMT 332. As part of the process, CE will
        determine the need for LBP testing and/or abatement.
        12.2.3.3.2. Ensuring facility occupants do not touch, disturb, saw, drill, or sand surfaces
        painted with known or suspected LBP.
        12.2.3.3.3. Contacting CE’s LBP Contract Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) if facility
        occupants discover a potential LBP hazard. Facility managers will request contract LBP test-
        ing and/or abatement on AF IMT 332. Customers pay for LBP testing and abatement if
        required.
     12.2.3.4. For more information on asbestos and LBP contact CE’s Environmental Flight or the
     Asbestos/LBP Contract QAE.

                       BIO-ENVIRONMENTAL FLIGHT (BEF) SERVICES

The BEF from the base hospital is responsible for oversight of the base OSHA’s Hazard Communication
(HAZCOM) Program IAW AFI 90-821, Hazard Communication Program, and for providing facility sup-
port services to identify or eliminate potential health hazards or deficiencies in the work environment.
Facility managers must be familiar with the HAZCOM Program, the services the BEF provides, and the
facility manager’s role in supporting BEF programs and identifying potential facility health hazards.

13.1. HAZCOM. Established to ensure workers are trained on the chemical hazards in their work envi-
ronment. This training is required when workers are exposed to chemicals in excess of general household
usage rates. If chemicals are not used in excessive rates, an MSDS is still strongly recommended for use
during spills to ensure appropriate personnel protective equipment is worn. It consists of three elements
that require action by supervisors: written program, labeling of chemicals, and training.
   13.1.1. Written Program. This task includes establishing a 3-ring binder with AFI 90-821, SCOT-
   TAFBI 48-101; local operating procedures; a listing of chemicals in the work area; MSDS for each
   chemical; and operating instructions on non-routine tasks. These items must be maintained in the
   work area where the chemicals are used.
   13.1.2. Labeling of Chemicals. Manufacturers must label their products to include the identity, hazard
   warnings, and name and address of manufacturer. Secondary containers or containers with unreadable
   markings must be labeled.
   13.1.3. Training. Training is required for supervisors and workers. Military Public Health (MPH),
   256-4986, administers the initial HAZCOM Training. Supervisors must conduct work-area specific
   training at least annually, anytime a new hazard is introduced into the work area, and when new work-
   ers begin employment. Training must be documented on AF IMT 55, and must include HAZCOM
   Program information, chemical hazards and control measures in the work area, and instruction on the
   use of an MSDS.

13.2. Facility Support Services. The BEF can assist facility managers and CE in surveying facilities for
potential health hazards or facility deficiencies related to occupational health and safety such as:
   13.2.1. Determining work center lighting-level deficiencies. Lighting concerns involving safety or
   health should be coordinated with BEF and the Wing Safety Office for evaluation.
   13.2.2. Determining facility ventilation or exhaust hood deficiencies (i.e., vehicle maintenance bays,
   wood hobby shops, paint booths, kitchen facilities, etc.).
   13.2.3. Assessing facility indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns (i.e., carbon monoxide, fumes, mold,
   etc.). Refer to facility manager’s responsibilities in this paragraph for more information.
       13.2.3.1. General. Many HVAC systems on Scott AFB have been updated to conserve energy.
       Methods such as adding insulation and reducing or eliminating fresh air intakes have been used to
       cut energy costs. As a result, IAQ may deteriorate due to inadequate air ventilation. Personnel may
       feel more fatigued and/or have headache or sinus issues at work, yet feel fine outside of the work
       center. There may be several potential factors that can cause these health issues such as mold and
       carbon dioxide. If personnel feel that IAQ is an issue, they should contact the facility manager,
28                                                     SCOTTAFBPAM32-1001 22 FEBRUARY 2007


        who in-turn can contact BEF, 256-7307, or MPH, 256-4986. The BEF and MPH will work
        together with the facility manager to determine any heath risks, investigate possible causes, sam-
        ple if needed, and recommend corrective actions.
        13.2.3.2. Carbon Monoxide. Vehicle, furnace and water heater exhaust may sometimes be picked
        up by facility air intakes. This can lead to significant carbon monoxide levels in a facility. Person-
        nel may experience headache or fatigue. If you feel there is a potential carbon monoxide concern
        in your facility, evacuate the facility and contact the Fire Department to activate emergency
        response procedures. Fire Department personnel will respond and sample the air for carbon mon-
        oxide levels and clear the facility for reentry once the hazard is isolated or if no hazard exists. If
        carbon monoxide monitoring is necessary, facility managers are responsible for obtaining, install-
        ing, and maintaining carbon monoxide detectors in the facility. If detectors signal high carbon
        monoxide levels, contact the Fire Department and BEF for assistance.
        13.2.3.3. Formaldehyde. New construction materials, furnishings and carpet may give off formal-
        dehyde gas during the first few months. Try to keep areas well ventilated, especially if personnel
        experience irritated eyes, nose, or throat. If symptoms persist, facility managers should contact the
        BEF.
     13.2.4. Assessing facility water quality concerns. Note: CE’s water shop regularly samples and tests
     base water and provides this information to Bio-Environmental.

13.3. Facility Manager’s Role. In support of Bio-Environmental programs, facility managers are respon-
sible for:
     13.3.1. Ensuring the facility is in compliance with OSHA’s HAZCOM Standard by ensuring all work-
     ers under the facility manager’s control are trained on the chemical hazards in their work environment.
     13.3.2. Addressing Potential IAQ Concerns of Facility Occupants. Potential occupational IAQ con-
     tamination is defined as an increase of negative signs/symptoms experienced by a worker when in the
     work center which decrease when the worker is away from the work center. When addressing IAQ
     concerns, facility managers will advise workers experiencing health effects on the job to seek medical
     attention. However, if numerous complaints arise where workers are experiencing persistent negative
     symptoms that increase in the work center and decrease when away from the facility, then the facility
     manager must:
        13.3.2.1. Conduct an HVAC system inspection to ensure these systems are functioning correctly
        and are properly maintained prior to contacting the BEF to avoid unnecessary medical surveil-
        lance. A completed copy of the Facility Manager’s HVAC Inspection Checklist (Attachment 8)
        will accompany all initial requests for medical surveillance.
        13.3.2.2. Develop a facility diagram detailing the locations in the facility where workers are expe-
        riencing potential IAQ signs and symptoms.
        13.3.2.3. Notify the BEF and request medical surveillance by forwarding a completed copy of the
        Occupational IAQ Medical Surveillance Checklist (Attachment 9), as well as completed copies
        of the Facility Manager’s HVAC Inspection Checklist, and a facility diagram detailing the poten-
        tial IAQ problem areas.
        13.3.2.4. Assist the BEF and MPH in the medical surveillance process. Occupational IAQ medi-
        cal surveillance will consist of work center epidemiology and monitoring. Epidemiology will con-
SCOTTAFBPAM32-1001 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                   29


       sist of medical screening questionnaires for 100 percent of personnel working in the area of
       complaint. A copy of the IAQ Medical Questionnaire (Attachment 10) will be provided to the
       facility manager who will ensure each worker within the affected area receives a copy along with
       a sealable envelope for protecting personal privacy. Facility managers will collect medical ques-
       tionnaires from each individual in a sealed envelope and then pass the sealed envelopes to MPH.
       Once all questionnaires are returned and tabulated, work center monitoring will be conducted to
       quantify potential sources revealed by Epidemiology Surveillance. A health-risk assessment and a
       recommendation for cost-effective remediation will be provided to commanders once medical sur-
       veillance is complete. Note: Since facility managers are not medical personnel, they are not
       allowed to review privacy protected medical information. Therefore, all medical questionnaires
       must be collected in sealed envelopes and passed on to MPH for review.
   13.3.3. Act as liaison between BEF, MPH, and occupants for subsequent medical screening, monitor-
   ing and corrective action for health-related issues in the facility.

13.4. For more information on Scott’s Occupational Health and Environmental Surveillance Program,
refer to “A Guide for Occupational Health and Safety Training” prepared and distributed by MPH. This
booklet contains information on hazardous noise, radiation, heat disorders, chemical hazards, Respiratory
Protection Program, pollution prevention, occupational physicals, and hazards for pregnant employees. If
you have any questions, please call MPH, 256-4986. For emergencies after normal business hours, con-
tact the BEF through the Hospital Emergency Room.

                               IDENTIFYING WORK REQUIREMENTS

Facility managers serve as the facilities’ primary point of contact for initiating work requirements with
CE. They are responsible for tracking, monitoring, and reporting work status information to facility occu-
pants as needed. Facility managers must ensure that no self-help or contract by requester facility work is
accomplished in their facilities without prior approval from CE on AF IMT 332. Depending on the type of
service requested, facility managers use one of the following methods to identify work requirements to
CE:

14.1. Service Call. Facility managers may phone CE Customer Service, 256-2202, to place a service call
when reporting minor repair requirements to existing facilities or utilities (i.e., blocked toilet, inoperative
door locks, loss of power/water/heating/cooling, etc.). Anyone can phone in an emergency to CE; how-
ever, facility managers must ensure that facility occupants inform them of any service calls placed without
their knowledge.

14.2. AF IMT 1219, BCE Multi-Craft Job Order. Facilities that are maintained by the High Impact
Team (HIT) use AF IMT 1219 to identify and list minor maintenance items for the team to accomplish
during periodic facility visits. If required during the visit, the team will also perform periodic maintenance
to the facilities electrical, air conditioning, heating, ventilation, and plumbing systems. Facility managers
identify work that is beyond the team’s capability to accomplish on AF IMT 332. For a list of facilities
visited by the HIT team, reference Hit Maintenance Facility List (Attachment 7).

14.3. AF IMT 332. Facility managers submit AF IMTs 332 to CE Customer Service for all requirements
involving new work, major repairs, facility alterations/improvements, and construction. A formal request
is also required for routine work, self-help, and contract by requester work. Due to funding limitations,
not all work requests can be accomplished. Mechanisms such as the WO Priority Program and Facilities
Board are designed to involve customers and senior leadership in prioritizing their work for evaluation by
CE for potential funding and/or execution. Since all requirements cannot be funded, these programs help
CE focus its available resources on the customer’s priorities. These programs are covered in greater depth
under the Civil Engineer Overview Section of this instruction. When submitting AF IMT 332 to CE Cus-
tomer Service, facility managers must:
     14.3.1. Ensure the work request has been properly signed and coordinated on by unit representatives.
     As a minimum, the facility manager must sign AF IMT 332, Blocks 11-13, or coordinate in Block 14.
     When major work is required, the unit commander must sign the AF IMT 332, Blocks 11-13, and the
     facility manager will coordinate in Block 14. Additionally, some organizations may require a unit
     facility manager and/or a group facilities manager to coordinate on all AF IMTs 332 before bringing
     requests to CE. If the request does not have the correct signatures or coordination, the request will be
     returned to the customer to complete.
     14.3.2. Ensure the work description is clear and complete.
     14.3.3. Ensure all required supporting documentation is provided. This may include maps, floor
     plans, or sketches of areas affected; extracts of any AFI, directive, or technical order referenced on the
     request; fire/safety or other inspection write-ups; equipment specifications (power/cooling require-

   ments); and for contract by requester work any statements of work or contractor quotes provided. Fail-
   ure to provide this information will delay the processing of your request.
   14.3.4. Ensure the donated resources, Block 10, is filled out correctly. Units may donate funds, labor,
   or materials, or they may be requesting to contract the work themselves with CE’s approval or permis-
   sion. If donating resources, the unit is donating resources to accomplish the work being requested. For
   example, do not mark the donated funds block if your unit is buying a shredder and the request is to
   provide an outlet for it, unless the unit intends to pay for CE’s electrical work. If the unit isn’t donating
   resources, select none on the form.

14.4. AF IMT 103, Base Civil Engineer Work Clearance Request. This form is commonly called a
"digging permit" because it's required prior to any digging. In accordance with Illinois State Regulations,
any disturbance of earth requires a digging permit. It is also used for any work that may disrupt aircraft or
vehicular traffic flow, base utility services, protection provided by fire or intrusion alarm systems, or rou-
tine activities of the installation. Process the form just prior to the start of the work. If delays are encoun-
tered or the conditions at the job site change, the form must be revalidated and re-approved. The form is
valid for 28 days after it has been approved. The project must start within 14 days of the approval date.
This permit is initiated through CE’s Maintenance Engineering Section, Bldg 531. If this requirement is
ignored and damages are incurred, all costs for repairs will be charged to the responsible party.

                                            RECORDKEEPING

Facility managers will establish a continuity book for each facility or group of facilities they manage. As
a minimum this book should contain:

15.1. Facility manager appointment letter.

15.2. Key control register/hand receipts.

15.3. Work Request/Service Call Log, along with copies of all AF IMTs 332 and AF IMTs 1219 (for HIT
Team facilities, Ref: Attachment 7). Attachment 3 and Attachment 4 provide sample Work Request

from CE Customer Service.

15.4. Various Facility Manager inspection documentation.
     15.4.1. Facility Manager’s Checklist (Attachment 5).
     15.4.2. Facility Manager’s HVAC Inspection Checklist (Attachment 8).
     15.4.3. If applicable, documentation of complaints from occupants experiencing signs/symptoms
     potentially associated with indoor air quality contaminants and all subsequent medical screening,
     monitoring, and corrective actions. This includes a copy of any Occupational IAQ Medical Surveil-
     lance Checklist submitted to the BEF. (Ref: Attachment 9)

15.5. Facility fire prevention program information (fire evacuation plan, fire safety training, inspections,
write-ups, etc.).

15.6. A written work center HAZCOM Program Book including AFI 90-821; SCOTTAFBI 48-101,

Section D—Civil Engineer Overview

16.1. As a facility manager, the more you know about CE’s services, priorities, work processes, and pol-
icies the easier your job will be. CE Customer Service serves as your primary focal point for obtaining CE
information and assistance. The following sections provide an overview on CE’s facilities and infrastruc-
ture mission: work categories, priorities, and work processes, and an overview of some of the base sup-
port services CE provides.

                          FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE MISSION

17.1. CE provides, operates, maintains, repairs, and constructs AF Real Property IAW all applicable fed-
eral, DoD, USAF, fire, safety, health, environmental, and financial laws, regulations, codes, and direc-
tives. Real property includes all real estate, facilities, and utilities carried on formal CE records, to include
RPIE. RPIE includes all equipment/apparatus that aids in the use of the facility regardless of its function,
such as components for providing facilities with power, water, heating, fire detection/protection, etc.
RPIE does not include furniture items, organizational equipment, specialized utilities, appliances, or com-
munications services.

                                           WORK CATEGORIES

As a facility manager, it is your responsibility to identify and report all known work requirements to CE.
It is CE's responsibility to estimate, plan, program, schedule, and accomplish the requested work in a
timely manner in accordance with base priorities. Effective communication between the facility manager
and CE Customer Service personnel is vital. Customer Service personnel will assign a work order/track-
ing number to each work requirement that is turned in and can provide updated status of each work
request on an as-needed basis. Estimated timelines for processing a given requirement depends on funds
availability, as well as the type and scope of work requested. Civil Engineer work requirements essentially
fall into one of five different categories.

18.1. Direct Scheduled Work Order (DSW). Work requirements that are small in scope, normally less
than 50 man-hours and/or $2500 in material cost. DSWs can be initiated verbally through the CE Service
Call Desk or in writing using AF IMT 332. DSWs are individually prioritized as emergency, urgent or
routine according to AFIs.
     18.1.1. Emergency. An emergency includes any work required to correct an emergency condition that
     is detrimental to the mission or reduces operational effectiveness. It includes providing security to
     areas subject to compromise, eliminating Risk Assessment Code (RAC) hazards of 1, Fire Safety
     Deficiency Code (FSDC) of 1, or protecting high-value property and equipment. An emergency
     includes, but is not limited to, the total failure of the electrical, fire protection, heating and air condi-
     tioning, or water and sewer systems. It also covers situations that would result in imminent or cata-
     strophic facility damage. A craftsman should respond within 24 hours of notification of an emergency
     DSW.
     18.1.2. Urgent. Urgent work includes work required to provide security to areas that could be com-
     promised; to eliminate RAC 2 and 3’s, FSDC of 2, or to protect valuable property or equipment. It
     includes work to unblock a stopped-up toilet that can’t be unblocked by a plunger, no heat in a single
     room, air conditioning inoperative in a single room, etc. The facility manager will make urgent
     requests, and Customer Service personnel will make the final determination as to whether or not the
     requirement is actually urgent. CE craftsman should respond to an urgent DSW within 7 calendar
     days.
     18.1.3. Routine. Work requirements that are essential and should be handled in a timely manner. Rou-
     tine work has a 30-day commitment.

18.2. Facility Maintenance Schedules. In facilities maintained by the HIT, CE schedules, and accom-
plishes minor maintenance and repair requirements on a regularly scheduled basis (i.e., monthly, etc.). On
the preestablished schedule, a facility inspector will meet with the facility manager and walk through the
facilities listed on Attachment 7. Between facility visits and during the inspection, facility managers list
minor maintenance and repair requirements for the facility on AF IMT 1219. A facility maintenance crew
(HIT team) will respond on their scheduled visit and repair as many AF IMT 1219 items as possible.
Items not accomplished during the visit will be carried over to the next visit.

18.3. Recurring Work. Recurring work applies to real property, real property installed equipment or sys-
tems, and other equipment maintained by CE. Recurring work consists of operations, recurring mainte-
SCOTTAFBPAM32-1001 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                     37


nance, service work, and other work for which the scope and level of effort is known without an earlier
visit to the job site each time the work is scheduled. It includes all recurring work needed to prevent
breakdown of critical facilities, equipment, or utilities.

18.4. Work Orders. Work requirements that require detailed planning, large material purchases, and/or a
large number of work hours. There are several methods of accomplishment for work orders.
   18.4.1. In-house Work Orders. Work requirements over 50 man-hours and/or $2,500 in material cost
   are considered for in-house accomplishment. In-house work orders are planned, programmed, and
   executed through the CE Operations Flight utilizing CE craftsmen.
   18.4.2. Self-Help Work Orders. The Self-Help Program gives the building occupants the opportunity
   to improve or enhance their facility. The Self-Help Center offers a limited variety of items to maintain
   or upgrade facilities. Before any self-help work is started, customers must obtain formal approval by
   CE on AF IMT 332. Customers will be held monetarily liable for any corrective or collateral facility
   work required due to unauthorized work.
   18.4.3. Contract by Requester Work Orders. In some cases, customers can fund and contract facility
   work themselves utilizing their GPC or by funding AF IMT 9. Before any work can be contracted,
   customers must obtain formal approval by CE on AF IMT 332. Customers will be held monetarily lia-
   ble for any corrective or collateral facility work required due to unauthorized work.
   18.4.4. Local Manufacture. Work requests submitted on AF IMT 332 from Base Supply with a DD
   Form 1348-6, Single Line Item Requisition System Document, attached. A local manufacture is an
   item that is so unique that Base Supply cannot find a vendor to manufacture. Base Supply will request
   CE, if the expertise exists to build the item. The customer pays Base Supply for the item and Base
   Supply reimburses CE.

18.5. Project/Contract Work Requirements. Work requirements that are beyond the capacity or capability
of CE in-house forces are considered for contract accomplishment. If approved for contract, a project
number will be assigned. Some contract work requirements can be accomplished through a SABER Con-
tract. Other contract work requirements may be accomplished through the regular Operations & Mainte-
nance (O&M) Contract Program. Projects are accomplished through the CE Engineering Flight.

                                      WORK PRIORITIZATION

In general, CE accomplishes work in the following order: DSWs (emergency and urgent), recurring work
and then routine DSWs, work orders, and projects depending on manning, and funds availability. In addi-
tion to general priorities, the Work Order Prioritization Program and Facilities Board are two mechanisms
utilized for prioritizing work orders and projects for review, funding, and execution.

19.1. Work Order Prioritization Program. Due to funding and manpower limitations, Scott AFB has
implemented the Work Order Priority Program which enables command elements of various groups of
organizations to prioritize all “new work” requirements for their group. In-turn, CE actively reviews and
processes the requirements on each group’s priority list. The number of priority requirements CE tracks
for each group is based on the amount of building space assigned to the group. Periodically, CE will hold
a prioritization meeting with each group and provide up-to-date status information on the group’s priori-
ties. Completed requirements and requirements that are converted to projects, create vacancies in the
group’s priority list once they are briefed and verified by group attendees. After all priorities are briefed
and priority vacancies are determined, units advocate to get their requirements added to their group’s pri-
ority list based on the number of available slots. Requirements that do not make the group’s priority list
are held by the applicable unit or group for potential prioritization at future meetings as priority slots
become available. Any requirements submitted directly to CE that are not on the group’s priority list will
be closed out, deactivated, and returned to the customer after coordination by base agencies. The cus-
tomer will be notified that accomplishment of the requirement will depend on whether or not the request-
ing unit is able to get the requirement on the group’s priority list and funding is available. Unit
commanders or designated unit facility managers are responsible for advocating their priorities to their
group. The Work Order Prioritization Program consists of the following groups.
     19.1.1. HQ AMC Facilities Working Group (FWG). The HQ AMC FWG consists of A-staff, United
     States Transportation Command, 18 AF, Tanker Airlift Control Center, AF Communications Agency,
     HQ AMC/Regional Supply Squadron, 15th Operational Weather Squadron, 868th Communications
     Group, Air Mobility Warfare Center, and 805th Computer Support Squadron. These units participate
     in the HQ AMC Top 20 Work Order Prioritization Program.
     19.1.2. 375th Airlift Wing (AW). This group consists of all wing staff agencies, as well as the 375th
     Comptroller Squadron. These units participate in the 375 AW Top 5 Work Order Prioritization Pro-
     gram.
     19.1.3. 375th Operations Group (OG). This group consists of all units assigned to the 375 OG (such
     as, 54th Airlift Squadron (AS), 375th Operations Support Squadron, 375th Aeromedical Evacuation
     Squadron, 457 AS, and 458 AS). These units participate in the 375 OG Top 5 Work Order Prioritiza-
     tion Program.
     19.1.4. 375th Mission Support Group (MSG). This group consists of all units assigned to the 375
     MSG (such as, 375th Civil Engineering Squadron, 375th Contracting Squadron, 375th Communica-
     tions Squadron, 375th Logistics Readiness Squadron, 375th Mission Support Squadron, 375th Ser-
     vices Squadron, and 375th Security Forces Squadron. These units participate in the 375 MSG Top 15
     Work Order Prioritization Program.

   19.1.5. 375th Medical Group (MDG). This group consists of 375 MDG units. These units participate
   in the 375 MDG Top 5 Work Order Prioritization Program.
   19.1.6. Other Priority Programs. A few smaller tenant units that fund and accomplish facility work
   themselves have their own priority programs. These units include the 932 AW, Defense Information
   Support Agency, and Defense Information Technology Contracting Office. Each unit has their own
   Top 3 Work Order Priority Program since minimal CE support is required to support their require-
   ments.

19.2. Facilities Board (FB). The FB meets on a quarterly basis and prioritizes all engineering projects for
potential approval and funding. The FB is chaired by the wing commander, consists of representatives
from each group, and major tenant unit on base. It establishes short-, mid-, and long-term base develop-
ment goals. Projects compete for design and construction funding. The number of priority projects that get
funded depends on available funding. Your group commander is your FB advocate for voicing your
group’s priorities.

                                          CE WORK PROCESS

Facility managers identify work requirements to CE either verbally or in writing, depending on the type
of work requested. Emergency and urgent DSWs may be called in to the CE Service Call Desk. All other
requirements must be identified on AF IMT 332. The following paragraphs outline the AF IMT 332 pro-
cess at Scott AFB. Scott AFB Work Order Process Flow Chart (Attachment 11) provides a flow chart of
the AF IMT 332 process.

20.1. Work Identification. Facility managers submit AF IMTs 332 to CE Customer Service for all
requirements involving new work, major repairs, facility alterations, improvements, and construction. A
formal request is also required for routine work, self-help, and contract by requester work. Facility man-
agers must also ensure the work request have been properly signed and coordinated and that all supporting
documentation is provided. Refer to paragraphs 17.3. through 17.3.4., this pamphlet, for further guidance
on submitting AF IMTs 332.

20.2. Initial Review. CE Customer Service personnel will review each AF IMT332 submitted for proper
coordination/signature, supporting documentation, and completeness. It is imperative that all sketches,
diagrams, maps, inspection write-ups, and/or applicable AFIs are attached to the request. This informa-
tion will help CE in determining the needs of the customer. If a request does not have the correct coordi-
nation, signature, or supporting documentation attached, the AF IMT 332 will be returned to the customer
to obtain the necessary items. Additionally, Customer Service will determine if the requirement must be
submitted through the Work Order Prioritization Program or if it can be accepted and processed as priority
program exclusion.
     20.2.1. Work Order Prioritization Program Requirements. Due to limited funding and manpower lim-
     itations, Scott AFB has implemented a Work Order Prioritization Program whereby unit and group
     command elements prioritize all “new work” requirements. Under this program, CE will only accept
     work and allocate resources including planning time, funds, and manpower to group priority require-
     ments. For all other requirements, customers must advocate their requirements to their group for
     potential inclusion in the group’s priority program as slots become available. AF IMTs 332 for new
     work that must be submitted through the priority program includes, but is not limited to, requests for:
        20.2.1.1. Adding, removing or relocating electrical outlets, switches, circuits, or building systems
        and equipment (i.e., fire alarms, suppression systems, generators (where authorized), water fix-
        tures, HVAC systems, etc.).
        20.2.1.2. Remodeling, renovating, or reconfiguring building space.
        20.2.1.3. Building upgrades, additions, expansions, or construction.
     20.2.2. Priority Program Exclusions. Priority program exclusions are requirements that CE will
     accept and process outside the Work Order Prioritization Program. Customer Service will provide the
     customer with a copy of the AF IMT 332 with the assigned control number and process the require-
     ment accordingly. The following types of requirements will be processed outside the priority program
     with some restrictions:
SCOTTAFBPAM32-1001 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                    41


     20.2.2.1. Service Calls. This includes verbal requests for emergency and urgent repairs to a facil-
     ity or its supporting utility systems. These requirements will be assigned a DSW number and sent
     to the applicable shop for accomplishment.
     20.2.2.2. Routine minor maintenance and repair DSWs. This service includes routine DSW-type
     work to maintain or repair existing facilities or it’s supporting utility systems. These requirements
     will be assigned a DSW number and sent to the applicable shop for accomplishment.
     20.2.2.3. Key Requests. This service includes requests for keys when submitted by facility man-
     agers. These requirements will be assigned a DSW number and processed IAW paragraphs
     13.2.4.1. and 13.2.5.
     20.2.2.4. Lock Changes. This service includes requests for changing out locks or rekeying locks.
     These requirements will be assigned a DSW or work order number and processed IAW paragraph
     12.2.4.2.
     20.2.2.5. Sign Requests. This work includes requests for signs from CE. Sign requests are
     reviewed, processed, validated, and approved or disapproved through appropriate officials. Only
     authorized signage is approved for accomplishment according to AF and base sign standards.
     These requirements will be assigned a work order number, validated, and if authorized, approved
     for accomplishment on a DSW.
     20.2.2.6. Base Infrastructure Requirements. If a customer requests that a major building system
     be replaced (i.e., roof, HVAC system, windows, doors, fire alarm/suppression systems, etc.), CE
     will pull historical service call records and assign a DSW number to have CE craftsmen determine
     if minor repairs can be made. If CE determines the system is beyond repair and requires replace-
     ment, CE will create a base infrastructure work order and prioritize it with similar systems
     base-wide. If the requirement isn’t a high enough base priority, units may advocate to have the
     requirement added into their group’s priority program.
     20.2.2.7. Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract Work. Requests that can be
     accomplished under CE’s IDIQ contracts will be processed and sent to the applicable contract
     manager for an estimate. Work accomplishment will depend on available funding and contracting
     requirements. Units may also advocate having these requirements added into their group’s priority
     program. Currently, CE has IDIQ contracts for roofing, fencing, painting, pavements, grounds/
     landscaping, and asbestos/lead-based paint testing work.
     20.2.2.8. Project Support Agreements. This work includes work requests in support of base com-
     munication systems upgrades. CE will assign a work order number, coordinate the requirement,
     and process each request on a case-by-case basis. Scheduling and accomplishment of the work
     will be dependent on funds and manpower availability.
     20.2.2.9. Fire Write-Ups. This request includes work to correct fire inspection write-ups or defi-
     ciencies. CE will assign a work order number and coordinate the requirement. Further processing
     actions will only occur if the requirement makes the Fire Department’s Top 5 Priority List.
     20.2.2.10. Safety Write-Ups. This request includes work to correct facility safety write-ups or
     hazards. CE will assign a work order number and coordinate the requirement. Further processing
     actions will depend on the severity of the requirements that do not warrant the assignment of a
     RAC or don’t pose a significant risk will only be processed further if they become a group priority.

20.3. Coordination. Upon acceptance of the request, CE Customer Service forwards the request for coor-
dination by various agencies at the weekly coordination meeting. At this meeting, representatives from
the Fire Department, Wing Safety, Bioenvironmental, CE Environmental, and Security Forces review and
coordinate on all work requests. If additional coordination is required, the customer must obtain it. Coor-
dination agencies will review and coordinate on each request. In some cases, these agencies will provide
additional guidance or restrictions on the work being requested. They may also recommend disapproval
of a request if the proposed work will not comply with all applicable directives.

20.4. Work Request Review Panel (WRRP). After all necessary coordination is received, the work
request is forwarded to the WRRP for review. It is chaired by the Chief of Operations and consists of rep-
resentatives from CE Customer Service, Engineering, Environmental, Real Property, Fire Department,
Maintenance Engineering, Planning, CE Contract QAEs, and CE Shop Superintendents. The WRRP
reviews, validates, and approves or disapproves each requirement, and it determines the best method for
accomplishing the work requested.
     20.4.1. Requirement Validation. Initially, the WRRP reviews and validates each requirement submit-
     ted to CE. If a request isn’t considered valid, it is disapproved and/or returned to the customer with an
     explanation. Validated requirements are forwarded to planning for review and estimate. After plan-
     ning completes their initial estimate, the requirement is returned to the WRRP with a recommended
     method of execution for approval consideration. When validating requirements, the WRRP considers:
        20.4.1.1. Coordination agency comments or recommendations for approval or disapproval IAW
        applicable guidance. Note: If the proposed work could disturb building materials that could poten-
        tially contain asbestos or lead-based paint, CE Environmental will require testing and/or abate-
        ment before the work can be approved or accomplished. In such cases, CE will provide the
        customer an estimate for any testing and/or abatement work required. Customers pay for all test-
        ing and abatement work (i.e., GPC, AF IMT 9), if required.
        20.4.1.2. Relevant AF, Major Command, or base policies or standards, if applicable.
        20.4.1.3. Future work plans (projected facility demolition, renovation, or construction work;
        upcoming facility moves; etc.).
        20.4.1.4. Work Priority. Work that must be prioritized under the Work Order Prioritization Pro-
        gram before CE can process it is validated and returned to the customer. CE will advise the cus-
        tomer that they must advocate the requirement to their group and get it added to their group’s
        priority program before CE can process the requirement further. If the requirement is a new group
        priority and validated, the request is sent to planning for review and an estimate.
     20.4.2. Method of Accomplishment. Based on CE’s initial review/estimate, planners will recommend
     a method of execution to the WRRP. The WRRP will discuss the planner’s estimate and recommenda-
     tions, assess the availability of funds, and select and approve an appropriate method of execution. Fur-
     ther processing of each requirement will depend on the method of execution and availability of funds.
     If funds are not available, the customer is notified and the requirement is put on funds hold. After
     WRRP approval, each requirement will be processed according to one of the following methods of
     execution:
        20.4.2.1. DSW. Work approved for accomplishment as a routine DSW is assigned a DSW number
        and sent to the appropriate shop for accomplishment, scheduling, and accomplishment of the
        requirement.
SCOTTAFBPAM32-1001 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                     43


     20.4.2.2. In-House Work Order. Work that is approved for in-house accomplishment is sent to
     planning to prepare job phase/task sheets, bill of materials, work clearance requests, and any other
     pertinent data. After the request is fully planned, it is sent to the in-service programmer to be pro-
     grammed into the future In-Service Work Plan. Estimated completion time for an in-house work
     order from the time of approval is approximately 180 days depending on funds availability. Addi-
     tionally, factors such as the scope of the requirement, the number of man hours required to do the
     work, scheduling backlogs, and material lead time can extend this timeline significantly.
     20.4.2.3. Self-Help Work Order. Work that is approved for self-help accomplishment is forwarded
     to planning for a full plan. Planning develops a material requirements list (if required), determines
     inspection requirements, and identifies any CE support required. CE Customer Service will con-
     tact the customer and provide a material requirements list for the using organization to purchase.
     The customer notifies the Self-Help Center when all materials are obtained, so an initial self-help
     project meeting can be set up to clarify customer’s responsibilities and inspection requirements.
     The customer must notify the self-help planner when predetermined phases of the project are
     ready for inspection and/or when the project is completed. The self-help planner will inspect the
     work accomplished and address any items requiring corrective action. Once the work passes final
     inspection by CE, the requirement is closed out.
     20.4.2.4. Contract by Requester. Work approved for accomplishment, Contract by Requester
     allows the customer to pay for and contract facility work on their GPC or AF IMT 9. Units may
     only contract facility work if they have Contract by Requester approval from CE on AF IMT 332.
     Depending on the complexity of the requirement, this method of accomplishment may or may not
     be appropriate. Customers requesting “permission only” to contract facility work must provide a
     copy of the statement of work (SOW) and any contractor quotes or proposals they have for CE
     review/approval. CE will review the SOW and advise the requester of any modifications that must
     be incorporated into the SOW prior to CE approval and going out to contracting. Once the SOW
     and AF IMT 332 is approved, the customer can go out and contract the work. CE will determine if
     any inspections are required depending on the work involved.
     20.4.2.5. IDIQ Contracts. Work approved for IDIQ accomplishment is forwarded to CE’s Engi-
     neering flight for a project number. Once assigned, the requirement is forwarded to the appropriate
     IDIQ contract manager in Maintenance Engineering to prepare a SOW, AF IMT 9, and a govern-
     ment estimate. IDIQ contracts are accomplished based on their priority and the availability of
     funds. If funds are not available, the requirement is put on hold awaiting funds. Note: Smaller
     scale IDIQ work may be contracted on a DSW or work order number.
     20.4.2.6. Engineering Contract/Project. Requests approved for contract are sent to the Engineer-
     ing Flight, Plans, and Programs Section to have a project number assigned. After the project num-
     ber is assigned, a status letter is prepared and sent to the requester. The project number should be
     used for future inquiries on work status.

                                      BASE SUPPORT SERVICES

The Maintenance Engineering Element of CE is responsible for overseeing and monitoring certain base
support contracts. Listed below is some important information for facility managers on a few of these
contracts.

21.1. Custodial Contract. This contract provides janitorial services to various base facilities. For facility
manager responsibilities under this contract, refer to paragraphs 8.1. through 8.1.4. of this pamphlet.

21.2. Grounds Maintenance Contract. This contract provides contracted landscaping services on base.
For facility manager responsibilities under this contract refer to paragraphs 9.1. through 9.1.6. of this
pamphlet.

21.3. Refuse Contract. This contract provides trash collection services on base. For facility manager
responsibilities under this contract, refer to paragraphs 9.3. through 9.3.3. of this pamphlet

21.4. Asbestos and LBP. This contract enables base customers the ability to quickly contract asbestos or
LBP testing and/or abatement work with their funds utilizing their GPC or AF IMT 9. Work identified on
AF IMT 332 that requires asbestos or LBP testing and/or abatement is forwarded to the Asbestos and LBP
QAE. For more information, contact CE’s Asbestos and LBP QAE.

21.5. Portable Latrine Contract. This contract enables base customers the ability to contract portable
latrines for special functions with their funds utilizing their GPC or AF IMT 9. Facility managers should
request portable latrine services on AF IMT 332 (30 days prior to the event) and provide a map identify-
ing the location where these latrines are to be placed. For more information, contact CE’s Portable Latrine
Contract QAE.

21.6. Paint Contract. This contract provides facility painting services for the base. Facility managers
request facility work on AF IMT 332 to CE Customer Service. This rule also applies to work the customer
wants to accomplish self-help or contract by requester. IAW Illinois and Federal Environmental Protec-
tion Agency directives, all facility work evaluated to determine if a potential LBP hazard exists and if
LBP testing is required. If testing and/or abatement are required, the LBP QAE will obtain the necessary
estimates for the customer to hire a contractor to accomplish the necessary testing and/or abatement. No
paint requirements will be accomplished until LBP clearance has been granted by CE Environmental or
the LBP QAE.

21.7. Carpet Contract. Currently, CE is in the process of establishing a carpet IDIQ contract. Once estab-
lished, this contract will enable base customers the ability to contract carpet tile installation and replace-
ment work with unit funds utilizing their GPC or AF IMT 9. Customers will be able to select from a
number of approved carpet colors/schemes that meet fire rating requirements and base-design standards.
Facility managers request carpet installation or replacement requirements on AF IMT 332. They must
also provide a floor plan showing the areas to be carpeted. If asbestos testing or abatement is required
(i.e., to sample carpet glue/mastic or the floor tiles underneath the existing carpet), CE’s Asbestos QAE
will obtain the necessary testing and abatement estimates for customer funding. Once asbestos issues are
SCOTTAFBPAM32-1001 22 FEBRUARY 2007                                                                    45


resolved (if any), the carpet IDIQ contract manager will provide a cost estimate to install or replace the
existing carpet. Accomplishment of the requirement will depend on funding by the requesting unit, Base
Contracting actions/requirements, and contractor scheduling or material lead times. Note: Customers are
responsible for removing organizational furniture and equipment to facilitate carpet replacement, unless
contract support can be arranged and the customer pays for the additional contract expenses.
   21.7.1. In headquarters facilities, the facility managers must obtain carpet-selection approval through
   the AMC Design Center. The facility manager must submit AF IMT 332 to HQ AMC/A7OO who will
   obtain design center’s concurrence. The AF IMT 332 must include the carpet manufacturer’s name,
   address, telephone number, style of carpet, color, part/item number, flame panel test rating (must be
   Class 1), and whether it is broadloom carpet or carpet tiles. The HQ AMC Design Center will verify
   the proposed carpet complies with Air Force Carpet Standards (ETL 03-3) and coordinates with the
   facility’s décor. The HQ AMC Design Center will annotate carpet approval by coordinating on AF
   IMT 332. The Base Fire Department will verify the carpet complies with required fire ratings and
   coordinate on AF IMT 332.
   21.7.2. For Wing administrative spaces, facilities managers must select carpet tiles from the
   pre-approved colors/schemes carried under the contract. For Wing executive spaces and community
   facilities requiring other than carpet tile, the HQ AMC Design Center is available for assistance with
   carpet selection. Requests for design center assistance is made through 375 CES/CEOE.
