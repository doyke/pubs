1. General Information. This instruction must be completely reviewed and complied with. It
defines the roles and responsibilities for the PST/PSS, combined the backorder cancellation
(BOC) and Non bill of material (NONBOM) B/O reconciliation OIs and added a requirement to
input demand codes on material orders. Caution and discipline must be used when processing
direct material requests in order to prevent excessive stockpiles of material, expenditure of
unnecessary funds and placing erroneous or inconsistent demands on the supply systems. The
front-end edits process within the automated bill of material (ABOM) system. This is an
important tool in preventing the issue of direct material that is excess to production requirements
and should be used to the maximum extent. Material issued in excess of requirements directly
impacts end-item sales costs and affects the accuracy of the bill of material (BOM). The
Wholesale and Retail Receiving and Shipping System (WARRS, D035K) retains all B/O
information which has obligated depot maintenance activity group funds. The PST/PSS will
conduct a monthly review on B/Os to ensure requirements are still valid, and when no longer
required request cancellation.
2. Front-End Edit Overrides. The planner will approve the front-end edit override if the
quantity ordered exceeds the planned quantity per assembly. The shop supervisor is ultimately
accountable for material usage and direct material costs in their shop. The PST/PSS is not
authorized to override ABOM front-end edits without the planner‘s approval. The PST/PSS will
validate each requirement and will inform the shop supervisor of all disapprovals.
     2.1. The PST/PSS will use either the ABOM single requisition screen for consumable items,
     or the ABOM exchangeable material requisition by unique ID screen for exchange items.
     ABOM pick lists can also be used to order consumables. The data on the pick list comes
     from the daily Depot Maintenance Material Support System (G005M)/Job Order Production
     Master System (JOPMS/G004L) feed; using this capability reduces data entry. The initial
     requisition passed from ABOM to the WARRS/D035K must be a 'B3' priority or higher,
     include the standard reporting designator and required delivery date to pass the information
     required to place the end item in awaiting parts.
309MXWI23-105 13 JANUARY 2011                                                                   3


   2.2. The PST/PSS will not use the ABOM NONBOM function without receiving written
   approval from the planner prior to, the issue request being input. Material will not be ordered
   directly into the WARRS/D035K when ABOM is operational. If the item is unplanned for or
   the production number and quantity requested exceeds the units per assembly, a message will
   appear on the screen.
      2.2.1. The PST/PSS will print the screen displaying the message and provide a copy of
      the screen print to the planner responsible for the BOM.
      2.2.2. The PST/PSS validates the requirement with the requester and recommends to the
      shop supervisor approval/disapproval. The PST/PSS will decide if there is a recurring
      demand. For recurring material orders through ABOM, use a demand code ‗R‘ and non-
      recurring use a demand code ‗N‘. NOTE: Demand code ‗R‘ builds a consumption data
      and drive stock levels in WARRS/D035K. Demand code ‗N‘ will not build consumption
      data or drive stock levels in WARRS/D035K.
      2.2.3. If the shop supervisor disagrees with the recommendation and the disagreement
      cannot be resolved, it must be elevated to the shop supervisor‘s superior (i.e., production
      section) for decision.
      2.2.4. Once the decision is made to approve the override of the front-end edits, the
      planner annotates the screen print with their approval and initials. The annotated screen
      print will be returned to the PST/PSS ordering material. The PST/PSS will process the
      material request using the ABOM NONBOM function. The PST/PSS will validate the
      operation number, production control number and the JON to ensure they are compatible
      with the resource control center (RCC). The PST/PSS will maintain the signed copy for
      1 year.
   2.3. A material request for items ordered through the Material Processing System (MPS) that
   establishes a BOM override cannot be processed by the PST/PSS. The PST/PSS can view
   the front-end edits, but does not have the access capability to change or process any data.
   These front-end edits are electronically sent directly to the planner. NOTE: MPS will only
   recognize/edit transactions that are over the maximum quantity authorized on the BOM.
   Over standard quantity front-end edits will automatically process the issue or B/O. (An
   option has been added to the main menu used by the PST/PSS that will set the front-end edits
   to standard by RCC. This is the F11 key, update commodity RCC.)
3. B/Os Against Closed JONS. All B/Os against a closed JON must be rolled to another end-
item, new JON or a cancellation requested prior to the JON moving to JON status code 2 or 3
(see Attachment 2).
   3.1. The PST/PSS will roll the JON or request cancellation on all B/Os prior to, or upon
   notification of JON closure. NOTE: When production is ready to turn a repaired item into
   supply, the PST/PSS will ensure all B/Os that are linked to that same end-item are rolled to
   another end-item, new JON or cancellation requested through Naval Air Industrial Material
   Management System (NIMMS). If the end-item has been turned into supply and a B/O is
   still linked to the end item, an ―AK‖ exception will generate. The Defense Logistics Agency
   (DLA) has the responsibility of working ―AK‖ exceptions with the applicable PST/PSS to
   cancel, file and maintain the B/O.
      3.1.1. The PST/PSS will make sure the following steps are completed for JON closure:
4                                                            309MXWI23-105 13 JANUARY 2011


           3.1.1.1. Ensure the B/O associated with applicable JONs are moved or cancelled in
           NIMMS.
           3.1.1.2. Ensure unserviceable turn-in has processed in the ABOM and passed to
           WARRS/D035K.
           3.1.1.3. Coordinate with the DLA Retail Item Manager if the turn-in has not
           processed in WARRS/D035K.
           3.1.1.4. Clear report for receipt (507) errors.
    3.2. The Depot Cost and Schedule Tool (DCAST) System is available on the Hill Portal
    https://opinfoc.hill.af.mil/portal/page/portal/portal_home/login/Tab87021 and will be
    used to ensure all B/Os are file maintained or cancellations requested. The PST/PSS is also
    responsible to ensure that all financial errors are corrected on the Defense Industrial
    Financial Management System (DIFMS). DCAST will be used for this requirement and it
    will provide all errors regardless of the age of the error when the JON closure Material Error
    Report option is selected (see Attachment 3).
       3.2.1. The PST/PSS will access DCAST and follow the steps below to access reports for
       JON closure:
           3.2.1.1. Select Reports
           3.2.1.2. Select JON Closure
           3.2.1.3. Select Material Errors
           3.2.1.4. Enter JON
           3.2.1.5. Select ‗JON CLOSURE‘
       3.2.2. Coordinate with the workload manager to determine if the B/O can be moved to an
       open JON. When the B/O can be file maintained, process the change in NIMMS
       (MN123P) B/O modify cancel request screen using document identifier (DOC ID) ‗ZF‘
       and type transaction code ‗B‘ (see Attachment 4). NOTE: Change will pass to
       WARRS/D035K. Some areas may use the Job Order Management System e-mail
       notification process. These notices provide the same information that can be accessed in
       DCAST and can be used to clear the errors in the same manner.
       3.2.3. Ensure the material due record is complete and updated on the NIMMS (MN084P
       screen).
       3.2.4. Ensure there are no outstanding dues on the DIFMS (MN036P screen).
    3.3. If determined that the B/O cannot be moved to an open JON or there is no longer a
    requirement for the item, request cancellation using the NIMMS (MN123P) B/O modify
    request cancel screen (Attachment 5) using a DOC ID ‗DG‘ and leaving the type transaction
    code blank. NOTE: Change will pass to WARRS/D035K.
       3.3.1. When a response is received from the source of supply that a B/O cannot be
       cancelled (WARRS/D035K BOC ‗3‘) and the B/O cannot be rolled to another end-item
       or JON, the material due can be modified to bring the material into the ‗Y‘ store when it
       is received.
309MXWI23-105 13 JANUARY 2011                                                                    5


          3.3.1.1. The document number requiring update will be processed on the NIMMS
          (NM123P screen), DOC ID ‗ZF‘ and type transaction code ‗D‘ (see Attachment 6).
          This will change the RCC designations and notify supply of the change for delivery
          purposes. The system will update the JON to the inventory JON. This transaction
          includes: Closing the original B/O and creating a new B/O with the new RCC and
          overlaying the notification to WARRS/D035K. A change may be required to update
          the building station for delivery purposes.
          3.3.1.2. Partial cancellations will follow the same logic. The B/O will be reduced to
          the quantity that can be satisfied by the system. NOTE: A list of BOCs and
          definitions can be found in WARRS/DO35K BOC list (see Attachment 7).
4. B/O Reconciliation Process.
   4.1. A monthly review of all B/Os is necessary to determine if the quantity ordered is in
   excess of current requirements and to verify specific data elements. It is the responsibility of
   the PST/PSS to validate B/Os for the RCC or production numbers they manage using the
   NIMMS report in the COGNOS system.
   4.2. B/O validation will be performed using the reports in COGNOS to ensure the NIMMS
   and WARRS/D035K contain identical data. Required reports include:
      4.2.1. NIMMS not in WARRS/D035K – (MN244R03), due is in NIMMS, no B/O in
      WARRS/D035K
      4.2.2. WARRS/D035K not in NIMMS – (MN244R02), B/O is in WARRS/D035K, no
      due in NIMMS
      4.2.3. 5 days shipped - (MN244R01), material released past 5-days or less
      4.2.4. 5 days not shipped – (MN244R04), overdue shipment report material released > 5
      days
   4.3. Validation will include JON, cost codes, B/O over 90 days old, cancellation status codes
   and priorities. The PST/PSS will:
      4.3.1. Verify JON is open (JON status code 0) by querying the NIMMS (MN095P) job
      order inquiry screen (Attachment 8). When the JON is closed, coordinate with the shop
      to determine if requirement still exists, if the B/O can be rolled to an open JON or if a
      cancellation request should be processed.
      4.3.2. Verify if the cost code is correct; if correction is required process a ‗ZFA/B‘ cost
      code change on the NIMMS (MN123P) B/O modify/cancel screen (Attachment 9).
      4.3.3. Review B/Os in coordination with production to determine if B/Os are still valid.
      If it is determined the B/Os are no longer valid, process the cancellation request.
      4.3.4. Review B/Os with cancellation codes. When BOC code is a ‗1‘, awaiting
      response from the source of supply and processed over 15 calendar days, coordinate with
      DLA for follow-up. NOTE: If BOC is a ‗2‘, source of supply has responded that the
      order cannot be cancelled, coordinate with DLA to process a ‗ZFA/Y‘ response in
      WARRS/D035K.
 6                                                        309MXWI23-105 13 JANUARY 2011


            4.3.4.1. Once the BOC is a ‗2‘ or ‗3‘, establish a ‗Y‘ detail in ABOM. To place the
            B/O into the ‗Y‘ store, the PST/PSS will process a document number change in
            (MN123P) B/O modify cancel request screen using a DOC ID ‗ZF‘ and type
            transaction code ‗D‘. NOTE: Change will pass to WARRS/D035K.
        4.3.5. Annotate all actions/cancellations on the B/O listing and keep on file for 2 months.

                                    JON STATUS CODES

Status Code = Blank: There are no JONs. Completions, production count and material
transactions are not allowed.

Status Code = 0: The JON is active. For permanent JONs, this status code is established when
the first induction is processed. Completions, production count and material transactions are
allowed.

Status Code = 1: The JON is sold. For permanent JONs, this will be at or after the end of the
JON period (month or quarter). For temporary JONs, this code will be assigned regardless of the
JON period during the end of month processing cycle. Trailing production count and material
transactions are still authorized.

Status Code = 2: The JON is complete. This code is assigned at the end of month after the JON
has been sold (status code 2= for a full month). Trailing production count and material
transactions are not allowed.

Status Code = 3: The JON is cancelled. When this code applies it is assigned when the
inductions, completions and on-work order balances are all zero. Trailing production count and
material transactions are not allowed.

Status Code = 7: The JON is retained for historical purposes. This migration will allow the
G004B system to record status code 2 JONs in the project order master, before the actual
deletion of the record by G004L.
