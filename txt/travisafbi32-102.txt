This instruction implements AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities. It outlines procedures and require-
ments for the completion of excavation permits (also known as dig permits) on Travis Air Force Base
(TAFB). This instruction applies to all TAFB personnel and contractors who conduct excavations within
TAFB boundaries.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Publication has been updated to reflect minor changes in the current Travis AFB Dig Permit Procedures.
Those who dig must be fully aware of environmentally protected areas. An excavation permit is required
for all ground disturbances 6” or greater with the exception of sprinkler head and valve box replacement/
repair only. Excavation for major projects over 1,000 linear feet must be divided into smaller projects not
exceed the 1,000 linear feet dimension. A bar ( | ) indicates a change since the last edition.


1. Objectives.
   1.1. The objective of the excavation permit process is to protect facilities, utilities, and the environ-
   ment from unnecessary disruption by preventing damage to underground infrastructure and/or sensi-
   tive areas during excavations. The process is designed to make certain that those planning to dig
   anywhere on base are fully aware of environmentally protected areas and underground utilities in the
   area of the proposed excavation and that they are fully informed of proper procedures for digging in
   those locations.

2. Responsibilities.
   2.1. Requestor: The excavation permit requestor is responsible for the following:
       2.1.1. Read and comply with the requirements listed in this operating instruction during any exca-
       vation activity.

3. Excavation Permit Requirements.
   3.1. An excavation permit is required for all ground disturbances “6” or greater with the exception of
   sprinkler head and valve box replacement/repair only. This includes work to any unimproved surface
   within the base boundary.
      3.1.1. In order to prevent damage to underground infrastructure in emergency situations where
      excavation permit is not obtained, i.e., repair/replace sprinkler head and valve box, the only
      acceptable procedure is to hand dig.
   3.2. Excavation for major projects over 1,000 linear feet must be divided into smaller projects not to
   exceed the 1,000 linear feet dimension. Each 1,000-foot section requires a separate permit. A single
   excavation permit will not be issued for a building site or a trench-line exceeding 1,000 linear feet.
   3.3. 60 AMW Form 55, excavation permits for utility trenches will be good for 90 calendar days from
   the date of final approval. A new permit for utility trench excavation will be issued only after work in
   the previous area is complete.
   3.4. Excavation permits will remain valid for 90 calendar days only if the requestor maintains all
   marked utility lines and provides a reference drawing that indicates the location of all marked utilities
   in the excavation permit area.
   3.5. 90 day permits only pertain to base owned utilities. The requestor must update the permit with
   Underground Service Alert (USA) every 14 calendar days.
   3.6. Prior to final approval, the requestor must contact USA.
      3.6.1. The requestor must supply the Maintenance Engineering representative with the USA loca-
      tion request number.
      3.6.2. Maintenance Engineering representative will indicate the USA number on the permit.
      3.6.3. The requestor will contact USA to renew any utility markings in the field.
   3.7. The requestor may call the Maintenance Engineering representative for re-marking of base utility
   lines, if necessary.

       3.7.1. If remarking is necessary, resubmit 60 AMW Form 55 with enough processing time (four
       working days) before expiration. If new 60 AMW Form 55 is not established prior to expiration
       date, excavation process must come to a halt until a new excavation permit is approved and
       signed.

4. Excavation Procedures.
    4.1. The requestor shall hand dig within two feet, on either side, of marked utilities.
    4.2. Power equipment may be used where utilities are noted in the following instances:
       4.2.1. To remove existing pavement or floor surfaces only if it has been determined that there are
       no utilities in the pavement or floor surface.
       4.2.2. To break the surface of the soil.
       4.2.3. The area has been scanned by a utility system detector and it has been determined that there
       are no utilities present.
    4.3. If utilities are not found after hand excavation of 24 inches on each side of the utility markings,
    the requestor will contact the appropriate Civil Engineering/Communications representative for a
    more precise location. If the utility still cannot be found, the requestor may proceed cautiously with
    excavation in the area. (Note: The 24-inch boundary does not apply to depth, and the contractor is lia-
    ble for any damage to utilities within the marked area).
    4.4. If an unmarked utility is located; the requestor shall notify the Civil Engineering/Communication
    representative and update the field drawings.
    4.5. If any utility is damaged, the contractor must immediately notify the Maintenance Engineering
    representative and provide the following information: exact location, type of utility damaged, extent
    of damage, name and phone number of where the contractor can be reached.
    4.6. The requestor will notify Maintenance Engineering when work is completed.
    4.7. A copy of the excavation permit shall be maintained at the excavation site at all times.

5. Definition of Terms.
    5.1. Requestor: Any individual, contractor, or organization, either military or civilian, which proposes
    to conduct earthmoving activities of any kind within Travis AFB.
    5.2. Civil Engineering/Communication: 60 Civil Engineer Squadron/60 Communication Squadron
    representatives to include all organizations that have subsurface utilities on TAFB.
    5.3. Coordination Meeting: A meeting that is conducted to bring Civil Engineering/Communication
