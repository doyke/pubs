                                  1. Safety is everyone's responsibility and must be an integral
                                     part of our culture!

                                  2. Protecting our resources is vital to our success.

                                  3. Unnecessary risk jeopardizes our mission, Airmen and
                                     resources.

                                  4. DO NOT allow safety to be sacrificed in the name of
                                     expediency. There is no task so urgent or important that it
                                     must be accomplished at the expense of sound Risk
                                     Management principles.
Colonel Edward S. Brewer
Commander



      The following principles form the foundation for the 314 AW's safety program:


 Do your job safely and correctly the first time using established guidance, procedures, focus,
  and sound judgment.

 Be assertive in challenging the hazardous actions or marginal performance of others. There is
  no circumstance that requires you to "bend the rules" to meet an operational requirement.

 Off-duty safety awareness and risk management is every bit as important as on-duty efforts.
