   to include Air Force Reserves and Air National Guard, US Navy, US Marines, US Army, US
   Coast Guard, and tenant units will ensure compliance with this instruction.
2. Operations.
   2.1. General. Hickam Field is a shared-use airfield. The State of Hawaii is responsible for
   operations and maintenance of Honolulu International Airport (HIA). Joint Base Pearl
   Harbor- Hickam (JBPHH) is responsible for operations and maintenance of Hickam Ramp.
   The Hawaii Air National Guard (HIANG) has operational control and responsibility of
   Taxiway “M” and all aircraft parking/maintenance facilities accessed by Taxiway “M”. Air
   Traffic Service is provided by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) which provides all Air
   Traffic Services (Terminal, Approach, and En-route control) including Navigational Aids,
   Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures, and Automated Terminal Information Service
   (ATIS) for HIA and Hickam Field. Services to include local flying area and Visual Flight
   Rule (VFR) and Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) procedures, breakout, go around, and missed-
   approach procedures are identified in the DoD Flight Information Publications (FLIPs) and
   the Hawaii Airports and Flying Safety Guide available on line at
   http://hawaii.gov/dot/airports/library/publications-and-statistics.
   2.2. Runways and Taxiways. The State of Hawaii operates four active runways supporting
   operations at HIA and Hickam Field. Field elevation is 13 feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).
   Runway selection is determined by Honolulu FAA.
       2.2.1. Runway 08L/26R, the primary instrument runway, is 12,300 feet x 150 feet. The
       first 5,000 feet of 8L is constructed of Portland cement concrete overlaid with six inches
       of asphalted concrete (see Attachment 3). The runway gradient is 0.37% down
       Eastward.
       2.2.2. Runway 08R/26L, identified as the Reef Runway, 12,000 feet x 200 feet of
       asphalt, is the primary runway for heavy aircraft departures (see Attachment 3). There is
       no runway gradient for this runway.
       2.2.3. Runway 04R/22L, an instrument runway, is 9,000 feet x 150 feet and constructed
       of asphalt (see Attachment 3). The runway gradient is 0.0028% down Northeast.

       2.2.8. All Hickam Field taxilanes and taxiways are 75 feet wide and stressed for the
       heaviest aircraft in the AF inventory. All four engine aircraft should use inboards only
       when taxiing in front of the alert facility on taxiway Tango. No other taxi power setting
       restrictions exist for Hickam Field.
    2.3. Airfield Operating Restrictions. All operational/airfield restrictions (closure or
    adjustments of any part of Hickam Field, reduction of aircraft servicing, special aircraft
    movements, etc.) must be coordinated/approved by the Airfield Manager. There are no
    permanently closed/unusable portions on Hickam Field.
       2.3.1. Hickam Field, with the exception of Taxiways Tango and Victor, is designated a
       Non-Controlled Movement Area. The Controlled Movement Area are areas within the
       State of Hawaii, Airport Operations Area (AOA). This includes the active runways,
       taxiways, and authorized areas of the airfield utilized for taxies and takeoff and landings
       of aircraft, including helicopter hover taxiing (exclusive of aprons). AOA markings are a
       solid, yellow line parallel to a dashed yellow line identifying the AOA boundary on
       Hickam Field at taxiways V, M, and A1-A4. For parameters, access and exit procedures
       for the AOA see 15 AWI 13-201, Airfield Driver’s Program (to be replaced by 15 WGI
       13-213, Airfield Driving Program).
           2.3.1.1. Airfield Vehicle/Pedestrian Operations. For a comprehensive explanation of
           vehicle/pedestrian movements on Hickam Field and within the AOA please refer to

       2.3.2. Hickam Ramp Facility (HRF) is not an ATC facility and will only provide
       advisory information.
       2.3.3. All large-frame aircraft parked on spots 1-5 D must be moved before C-5/B747
       taxiing on Taxilane HB. Aircraft on 9B must be moved south to the original 9B spot
       before C-5/B747 taxiing on Taxilane HB. All other aircraft near these spots with less
       than 25 feet wing-tip separation must have wing-walkers. Also, all equipment and
       vehicles parked in front of Hangar 19 must be moved to allow wing-tip clearance for C-
       5/B747 (see Attachment 2).
       2.3.4. Base-assigned aircraft may taxi or tow between rows of parked aircraft, provided
       taxi lines and nose wheel parking spots are visible and wing-walkers are used when wing-
       tip clearance is less than 25 feet. Transient aircraft are met by the Transient Alert (TA)
       contractor and led to parking.
           2.3.4.1. Aircraft with wingspans larger than 170 feet (C-5, B747, etc.) require a wing
           walker to traverse Taxiway Tango. Obstruction located 135 feet west of taxiway
           centerline. The obstruction is the northern portion of the security fence surrounding
           the Alert Pad.
           2.3.4.2. Aircraft with wingspans larger than 134 feet require wing walker to traverse
           Taxilane HC to Row 22. Obstruction located 117 feet away from HC taxilane

       will cross a runway or enter Honolulu’s AOA must be in radio contact with Honolulu
       Control Facility (HCF) Ground Controller.
       2.8.4. IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on the Ground, when
       taxiing in close proximity to obstructions and proper wing-tip clearance is not available,
       the following guidance will be followed: Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of
       obstructions without wing-walkers monitoring the clearance between aircraft and the
       obstruction. Locally based aircraft are exempt from this rule when fixed taxi routes are
       marked and the obstruction is a permanent structure. Also exempt are aircraft parked on
       a spot specifically designed for that aircraft. The support equipment must not be closer
       than 10 feet from the wing-tip.
       2.8.5. Heavy Aircraft Jet Thrust Avoidance Procedures. Aircraft shall not taxi or be
       towed within 200 feet to the rear of any heavy aircraft while engines are running.
    2.9. Precision Approach Critical Areas.
       2.9.1. Honolulu runways have four Precision Approach Critical Areas requiring
       protection from possible signal interference caused by aircraft and vehicles operating
       between the localizer/glideslope antennas and arriving aircraft conducting an Instrument
       Landing System (ILS) approach. These protected areas are the Localizer and Glideslope
       Critical Areas, located at the departure and approach ends of Runways 8L and 4R,
       respectively. Aircraft and vehicles are prohibited from operating in these areas when the
       reported ceiling is less than 800 feet or the visibility is less than two miles and an aircraft
       is on an ILS approach inside the Final Approach Fix. ILS instrument hold signs and
       taxiway instrument hold lines protect these areas as indicated in Attachments 5, 6, and
       7.
       2.9.2. Honolulu precision-approach-critical areas are protected IAW FAA criteria as
       described in FAAO 6750.16. The dimensions of the areas are as follows:

2.10. Engine Run Procedures.
      2.10.1. The respective MOC will coordinate all maintenance engine runs with HRF at
      least 15 minutes before engine start to deconflict airfield activities. The following
      information will be provided: tail number, type of aircraft, location of run, direction of
      run, run duration, and power setting.
      2.10.2. The following engine run procedures apply:
         2.10.2.1. Maintain radio contact with and obtain approval from HRF before all
         engine runs and before any power-setting changes.
         2.10.2.2. Reduce engine power settings or terminate the run if directed by HRF.
         2.10.2.3. Comply with all technical data, safety requirements, and any additional
         limitations specified by other directives.
         2.10.2.4. Notify HRF when engine run is complete.
      2.10.3. Blast fences must be used for engine runs Above Idle/Power Run. Blast fences
      must be used where available to ensure maintenance engine runs are conducted in a
      manner to prevent damage to facilities, aircraft, vehicles, and equipment.
      2.10.4. Personnel conducting maintenance engine runs during quiet hours must have
      prior approval IAW quiet hour procedures.
      2.10.5. Aircraft parking spots 9B (KC-135 or smaller only), 20A-D, and 8 row are
      designated locations for full-power engine runs. C5/KC10 aircraft can utilize the engine
      run spot on 8 row if they prior coordinate with 15th Maintenance Operations Control
      Center (MOCC) and AMOPS. The aircraft must be towed into or pushed back in the
      spot. Wing walkers are required if aircraft are on 7 Row. KC10 will not operate the tail
      engine on 8 row engine run spot. The Airfield Manager must authorize full-power engine
      runs at other parking spots. 735th and 15th MOCC will notify AMOPS prior to
      positioning an aircraft on the 8 row engine run spot.
      2.10.6. Engine runs may be accomplished on the HCP’s when the aircraft is loaded with
      explosives. Approval from the 15 WG/CC, coordinated through 15 WG/SE, is required
      to park any non-explosive laden aircraft on the HCP due to explosive safety Q-D arcs
      associated with the nearby explosive-storage facilities. Note: C-5 aircraft will not
      conduct high-power engine-runs on HCP unless they have an 800-foot distance as
      minimum for required jet-blast clearance.
      2.10.7. All fighter aircraft high-power engine runs will be accomplished in the 154 WG
      Hush House, trim pad, or on Runway 08R. High-power engine runs will not be
      accomplished on the trim pad or Runway 08R during quiet hours.
      2.10.8. Agencies requesting to conduct a high-power engine run at the approach-end of
      runways 04L, 26L, or 08R must coordinate the request through AMOPS at least 30
      minutes prior, with all applicable information. AMOPS will coordinate the request with
      HIA Operations Manager for approval.
      2.10.9. Aircrew who require engine power checks before take-off (e.g., C-130 aircraft)
      must coordinate with HRF for use of a designated location authorized for full power
      engine runs. HRF will assign an available spot for the engine-power check.

  2.11. Quiet-Hour Procedures.
     2.11.1. The following quiet hours for engine runs are in effect daily from 2300-0500L.
     During this period, engine runs above idle power will not be conducted without prior
     authorization. Engine runs may be authorized on a restricted basis. The hours of 2100-
     2300L and 0500-0600L are referred to as a “flex zone.” During these times, engine runs
     may be authorized based on the mission priority.
     2.11.2. All engine runs above idle power during quiet hours must have 15th Maintenance
     Group Commander (15 MXG/CC) approval (if possible, initiate calls before 2200L) and
     will be conducted on Row 20 (preferred), Row 22, the HCP (explosive-laden aircraft
     only), or runways 08R, 04L, and 26L. Engine runs at any other location must be a high-
     priority mission and specific justification must be provided to 15 MXG/CC for approval.
     Coordinate all requests for approval through 15 MOC. 15 MOC will coordinate with 15
     MXG/CC.
     2.11.3. Noise Abatement: All existing control measures will be implemented to limit
     noise on the airfield and its effect on the surrounding community.
  2.12. Explosive-Laden Aircraft Parking (ELAP)/Hot Cargo Pad (HCP).
     2.12.1. The 735th Air Mobility Control Center (735 AMS/AMCC), 735th Maintenance
     Operations Center (735 MOC), 15 MOC, or AMOPS will notify each other when an
     aircraft is carrying explosive cargo. These agencies will be notified of type aircraft,
     parking spot, tail number and type/quantity of munitions. The appropriate MOC shall
     notify 647th Security Forces Squadron (647 SFS/SFCC) of the above information and
     any changes. AMOPS will notify 647 CES/CED (Explosives Ordinance Disposal) and
     ensure no explosive detonations are accomplished when an explosive-loaded cargo
     aircraft is parked at Hot Cargo Pad 1.

         2.36.3.2. These investigators have access to factual data pertinent to the accident,
         (i.e., information contained in Part I of the SIB report). They may obtain a list of SIB
         witnesses. Investigators may interview controllers (including SIB witnesses) and get
         controller statements or testimony. SIB witnesses will only be interviewed after the
         SIB President releases them. Investigators may not have access to testimony or
         statements provided to the SIB. In addition, investigators may not ask or allow
         individuals to disclose what they told the SIB. Statements and testimony made during
         aircraft accident investigations are releasable to the public under the Freedom of
         Information Act. Note: Personnel may seek legal counsel before making statements
         or providing testimony to accident investigators.
         2.36.3.3. AFM should cooperate to the maximum extent possible to make factual
         information available to the investigating agency. The investigator may also request
         AOF personnel to provide statements as supplemental information to aid in the
         investigation. These statements should contain factual information only.
     2.36.4. Recorded Tapes/Tape Transcription Procedures. The HRF and AMOPS
     tapes are considered limited access and are not normally made available to the general
     public. If an incident or violation occurs on the airfield, individuals may request to listen
     to the recorder tapes via an official letter from their commander to the 15 OSS/CC.
     Justification must be provided that supports an exception to the limited access policy.
     Mishaps require the 15 OG/CC’s approval for release of information. Recordings are
     normally kept for 15 days. Any agency wanting access to the recordings should notify
     the AFM as soon as possible. Tape transcripts, if required, will be conducted IAW AFI
     13-204.
  2.37. Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) Communication Systems
  Maintenance/Priorities. HRF and AMOPS utilize various communication systems
  including but not limited to the Primary/Secondary Crash Alerting Systems, UHF/VHF
  radios and telephone lines to relay information critical to the safety of flight. HRF and
  AMOPS shall immediately report all communication systems outages to the 747th
  Communications Squadron (CS). 747 CS performs preventative maintenance inspections on
  assigned ATCALS systems within HRF, AMOPS, and Ground-to-Air Transmit & Receive
  site.

   Departure Procedures and Radar Vector to Initial Procedures are published in HCF Standard
   Operating Procedures (SOP) 7110.1 or FLIPs.
   2.39. Unscheduled/Unauthorized Aircraft Arrivals. When HRF/AMOPS is advised of an
   unidentified inbound, HRF/AMOPS will obtain the call sign, type aircraft, estimated time of
   arrival, departure station, reason for landing and Civil Aircraft Landing Permit Number (if
   applicable). AMOPs will utilize QRC # 6, Unauthorized Aircraft Arrival.
      2.39.1. AMOPs will attempt to validate the aircraft movement via Prior Permission
      Request (PPR) log and local units. Inbound civilian aircraft must have current landing
      permit and be operating under the approved purpose of use or an aircraft exempt from
      permit requirements IAW AFI 10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits.
      2.39.2. If the aircraft is not a local mission, AMCC mission, HIANG mission, or prior
      approved via PPR, the aircraft is not authorized to park on Hickam. AMOPs will advise
      HNL Tower and/or HRF to relay to the aircraft and advise that they must park on the
      Fixed Base Operator (FBO) side at HNL.
3. Airfield Procedures.
   3.1. Airfield Inspections. The AFM, Deputy Airfield Manager, or AMOPS personnel will
   conduct an airfield inspection of AF property at least once per day. The initial daily
   inspection will normally be accomplished no later than 0900. Inspections will be conducted
   to ensure the safe operation of airfield facilities and to prevent foreign object damage to
   aircraft. AMOPS will inform HIA Ramp Control and HRF of discrepancies affecting safe
   aircraft operations.
      3.1.1. The State of Hawaii, Department of Transportation-Airport/HIA Ramp Control
      inspects the runways and informs AMOPS of Runway Surface Conditions and
      discrepancies affecting safe aircraft operations. They will forward the information to
      AMOPS via the HRF.
      3.1.2. Any previously closed airfield area will be inspected prior to resuming normal
      operations. Prior to opening for operations, areas located on the shared-use portion of the
      airfield must also be inspected by HIA Ramp Control.                 Note:    Waivers to
      airspace/airfield criteria must be coordinated through the AFM and/or the HCF.
   3.2. Airfield Closures. AMOPS will process all Hickam Field, airfield restrictions and
   closures IAW AFI 13-204, Volume 3. Any airfield closure affecting the shared-use portions
   of the airfield will be coordinated with the HIA Airport Operations Manager a minimum of
   30 days prior to the closure date. Simultaneous closure of Taxiways Alpha and Bravo must
   be avoided due to the impact on commercial carriers. Note: Closing any runway during
   Kona (westerly) wind conditions is extremely difficult and should be avoided unless
   absolutely necessary.
   3.3. Airfield Sweeper and Mower Operations.
      3.3.1. Airfield Sweeper Priorities:
          3.3.1.1. Runway (only as needed per request of HIA Duty Manager).
          3.3.1.2. Hickam Ramp taxiways and taxilanes.
          3.3.1.3. Parking aprons.
15WGI13-204 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                  23


         3.3.1.4. Hangars or access areas leading to the airfield.
     3.3.2. 647 CES sweeper will report to AMOPS NLT 0900 on Monday, Wednesday, and
     Friday, and NLT 0800 Tuesday and Thursday. Saturday, Sunday and holidays the
     sweeper will be on standby unless prior arrangements have been coordinated. After-duty
     response time is no more than one hour.
     3.3.3. 647 CES sweeper will receive a briefing from AMOPS for areas requiring special
     attention or of any aircraft arrivals or departures that will require special sweeper
     attention. Once completed with any special requirements the sweeper will conduct
     airfield sweeping per the schedule noted below.
     3.3.4. See Attachment 13 for the Airfield Sweeping Schedule.
     3.3.5. All requests for sweeper support will be coordinated through AMOPS. AMOPS
     will first contact the airfield sweeper via radio; call sign Sweeper 1. If the sweeper
     operator does not respond, AMOPS will contact 647 CES Horizontal Section and provide
     all applicable information concerning the sweeping operation. During normal duty hours,
     the sweeper’s response time shall be within 15 minutes. After duty hours, response time
     shall not exceed one hour. Any deviations from the above times will be annotated and
     forwarded to 647 CES for corrective action.
     3.3.6. Sweeper will notify AMOPS when all sweeping operations are complete.
         3.3.6.1. It is important to realize FOD can delay missions or create a potential hazard
         to aircraft operations, possibly resulting in the loss of life or equipment. The
         expedient response of all agencies reacting to potential hazards on the airfield is
         required. Severely deteriorated pavements will have limited sweeper activity.
     3.3.7. Airfield mowers cut the grassy area along taxiway Alpha on Mondays and
     Wednesdays; the grassy area along taxiway Bravo on Wednesdays and Thursdays; and
     the grassy area along taxiway Mike on Fridays. The above schedule is alternated when
     runway 8L is closed, typically the second Tuesday of the month, to allow cutting of the
     grassy area along taxiway Tango and Victor. Mower operators have AOA badges and
     are licensed to drive on the AOA. They maintain VHF radio communication with HCF
     and HRF.
         3.3.7.1. Airfield mowers may deviate from the above schedule due to the need of
         increased cutting or decrease cutting due to lack of growth. The AFM will be notified
         and give approval before any changes in the primary scheduled cutting days.
  3.4. Airfield Lighting.
     3.4.1. HRF is responsible for operating airfield taxiway lighting on taxilanes HA, HB,
     Taxiways T and V, A-1 thru A-4 and Row 23 only. Honolulu Control Tower is
     responsible for operating all other airfield lighting. Specific lighting systems maintained
     at HIA can be found in the DoD Flight Information Publications.
     3.4.2. Airfield lighting operated by HRF will be energized 30 minutes before civil sunset
     and 30 minutes past civil sunrise unless a condition exists that may create a safety hazard
     to airfield operations.
     3.4.3. Any time a taxiway is closed, the airfield lighting in the area will not be turned on.
24                                                    15WGI13-204 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


     3.4.4. AMOPS will notify Airfield Lighting, HIA Ramp Control (if applicable) and HRF
     when outages exceed percentage allowable. AMOPS will record and monitor the status
     of airfield lighting.
     3.4.5. 647 CES Exterior Electric Shop is responsible for conducting airfield lighting
     weekly inspections and maintaining Hickam airfield lighting system to include the barrier
     markers located on State property. 647 CES will report all noted outages to AMOPS.
     3.4.6. AMOPS will conduct daily airfield lighting checks and report any outages to 647
     CES. Outages will be tracked until restored to operations.
     3.4.7. All lighting outages on the airfield will be reported to the Honolulu Control Tower
     and HIA Ramp Control. Applicable NOTAMs or advisories will be coordinated, as
     required.
     3.4.8. Airfield stadium lights are operated via photo-sensitive switches with the
     exception of the HCP. Stadium lights on the HCP must be manually turned on/off by the
     user.
  3.5. Aircraft Arresting Systems.
     3.5.1. Runway 08L (departure end) has an Aerazur textile arresting barrier (uni-
     directional). Runway 08R has a departure end BAK 12/14. Runway 04R has a BAK
     12/14 approach end barrier. Normal configuration is in the down position.
     3.5.2. Barrier maintenance personnel will inspect the barriers daily. They will report
     their findings to HRF and 154 WG/CP. HRF will pass the status of the barriers to
     AMOPS. AMOPS will record and monitor the status of the arresting systems.
     3.5.3. Aircraft requiring arresting gear engagement will notify Honolulu Control Tower.
     Honolulu Control Tower will raise the appropriate barrier and notify HRF. HRF will
     make notification of an engagement or anticipated engagement over the primary crash
     phone (excluding practice/certification engagements).
     3.5.4. When the arresting gear is down for maintenance, AMOPS will coordinate a
     NOTAM, as required.
     3.5.5. Barrier maintenance personnel will forward a copy of barrier certifications to the
     AFM.
  3.6. Flight Plan Procedures.
     3.6.1. In accordance with General Planning Chapter 6, all aircraft will file a completed
     DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, a minimum of one hour before proposed departure,
     and DD Form 1801 DoD International Flight Plan, a minimum of 2 hours before
     proposed departure time. Flight plans must be filed in person with AMOPS unless
     otherwise noted below.
     3.6.2. The units listed in paragraph 3.6.3 may fax or e-mail flight plans to AMOPS
     providing the following criteria are met.
        3.6.2.1. The flight plan must be faxed or e-mailed IAW the times listed in
        paragraph 3.6.1
15WGI13-204 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                             25


        3.6.2.2. A call is made to AMOPS at DSN 448-0046/0048 or Commercial 808-449-
        0046 to verify the flight plan was received, legible, and complete. Note: Aircrew is
        responsible for ensuring receipt of flight plan.
        3.6.2.3. The requestor must maintain the original flight plan IAW AFRIMS RDS
        (available on-line at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm).
     3.6.3. The following organizations may fax flight plans to AMOPS:
        3.6.3.1. 65th Airlift Squadron.
        3.6.3.2. 96th Air Refueling Squadron.
        3.6.3.3. 19th Fighter Squadron.
        3.6.3.4. 535th Airlift Squadron.
        3.6.3.5. 36th Operations Support Squadron (36 OSS Airfield Management, Anderson
        AB).
        3.6.3.6. PACAF Air Mobility Operations Control Center, 613th Air Operations
        Center.
        3.6.3.7. Hawaii Air National Guard units (199th Fighter Squadron, 203rd Air
        Refueling Squadron, 204th Airlift Squadron, Sentry Aloha).
        3.6.3.8. US Navy Executive Transport Detachment Pacific (ETD Pacific).
        3.6.3.9. 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (53 WRS).
        3.6.3.10. ACC/Det 2/Fighter Operations.
        3.6.3.11. 735th Air Mobility Command Center.
  3.7. Declaring Bird Watch Conditions (BWC).
     3.7.1. IAW 15 WG OPlan 91-2, the AFM, or a designated representative, serves as the
     primary OPR for declaring the BWC for the Hickam Ramp. The AMOPS supervisor on
     duty serves as a designated representative in the absence of the AFM.
     3.7.2. The BWC will be upgraded when hazardous conditions exist based on inputs from
     any of the following agencies: AMOPS ground observations, 15 WG Safety, 154 WG
     Supervisor of Flying, 154 WG OSS/OSA, USDA Wildlife Services, HIA Airfield
     Operations, HRF, 15WG/CP, 154 WG/CPO, 735 AMS/AMCC, pilot and controller
     reports.
     3.7.3. Once AMOPS declares a BWC, it is their responsibility to cancel, upgrade, or
     downgrade the condition commensurate with updated information.
     3.7.4. IAW 15 WG OPlan 91-2, the following terminology will be used for rapid
     communications to disseminate bird activity info and implement unit operational
     procedures.
        3.7.4.1. BWC SEVERE: BWC SEVERE is defined as one or more birds that pose an
        immediate threat to safe flying operations or heavy concentrations of birds (as a
        guide, more than 30 large birds [egrets, shearwaters, owls or herons] or more than 75
        small/medium birds [plovers, doves, mynas, sparrows or finches]) on or above the
26                                                      15WGI13-204 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


        runway, taxiways, in-field areas and departure or arrival routes. Takeoffs and
        landings for 15 WG and transient aircraft will be prohibited unless the 15 OG/CC
        authorizes approval. 154 WG aircraft will follow 154 OG/CC guidance for restricted
        flight operations under elevated bird watch conditions. Aircraft experiencing an in-
        flight emergency are exempt from this restriction if, in their best judgment, they deem
        continuing flight to be a greater hazard than the risk of a bird strike during the
        approach and landing.
        3.7.4.2. BWC MODERATE:              BWC MODERATE is normally defined as
        concentrations of 5 to 30 large birds (egrets, shearwaters, owls or herons) or 30 to 75
        small/medium birds (plovers, doves, mynas, sparrows or finches) observable in
        locations that represent a probable hazard to safe flying operations. Additionally,
        BWC MODERATE may be declared any time any bird activity represents a probable
        hazard to safe flying operations. Experience has shown that one large bird loitering
        over the airfield can cause significant damage to an aircraft on takeoff or touch and
        go.
        3.7.4.3. BWC LOW: Normal bird activity with a low probability of hazard.
     3.7.5. AMOPS will notify the following organizations when the BWC changes:
        3.7.5.1. HRF, if not previously notified.
        3.7.5.2. 15 WG/CP, if not previously notified.
        3.7.5.3. 735 AMS/AMCC.
        3.7.5.4. 154 WG Control Center.
        3.7.5.5. 15 OG/CC.
        3.7.5.6. 15 WG/SE.
        3.7.5.7. Transient aircrews (via the BWC in the flight planning room and posting a
        NOTAM for Hickam when the BWC increases to MODERATE or SEVERE).
     3.7.6. Bird Watch Conditions MODERATE or higher may require the immediate
     attention of USDA Wildlife Services for dispersal/depredation. AMOPS shall notify 647
     SFS/SFCC when firearm discharges may occur on Hickam Field property. In the event
     the USDA officer is not qualified to drive on the airfield, AMOPS will provide an escort
     onto the airfield. Escort services will only consist of assisting the officer in locating the
     birds and acting as a safety observer so aircraft are not in the line of fire. At no time will
     AMOPS personnel authorize the discharge of a weapon; they are only to serve as a safety
     observer.     In the interest of safety, they may take action to suspend bird
     dispersal/depredation operations.
     3.7.7. Phases I and II Bird Activity. Two phases of bird activity exist at Hickam Field
     and HIA. These phases are based upon historical bird activity associated with the
     migration of the lesser pacific golden plover.
        3.7.7.1. Phase I is May through July. During this period, the plover numbers are at
        their lowest levels. Phase II is from August through April. During September and
        October, large flocks of plovers exist on the airfield. Flocks as large as 700 birds may
15WGI13-204 20 SEPTEMBER 2011                                                                27


          exist in the infield for runway 8L/26R. During March and April, the birds gather
          again in large flocks staging for their migration at the end of April.
          3.7.7.2. The standards for declaring the BWC will remain the same during Phase I
          and Phase II. The purpose of the phases is to raise awareness of all agencies
          concerned with BASH at Hickam Field and HIA.
   3.7.8. Traffic Pattern Restrictions. During BWC LOW all takeoffs, IFR/VFR patterns and
   landings may occur using normal operational procedures. During BWC MODERATE,
   multiple IFR/VFR approaches are prohibited and only initial takeoffs and full-stop landings
   are permitted. During BWC SEVERE, all takeoffs and landings for 15 WG and transient
   aircraft are prohibited unless authorized by the 15 OG/CC. 154 WG aircraft will follow 154
   OG/CC guidance for restricted flight operations under elevated BWCs. Aircraft experiencing
   an in-flight emergency may land if, in their best judgment, they deem continuing flight to be
   a greater hazard than the risk of a bird strike during the approach and landing.
   3.8. Airfield Maintenance. Grass height on the airfield will be three to four inches in
   height IAW USDA recommendations and AF Safety Center grass height waiver dated 26
   March 2004. 647 CES shall ensure mowers maintain this grass height at all times.
3.9. Weather Dissemination and Coordination Procedures. Weather warnings and watches
received from 17th Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) or 15 OSS/OWS will be disseminated
IAW applicable section checklists.
   3.10. Aero Club Operations. Hickam Field does not have an aero club assigned at the
   base.
   3.11. Airfield Snow Removal Operations. Hickam Field does not receive any
   accumulation of snow. No snow plan is required nor are Runway Condition Reading (RCR)
   values taken.
4. Airfield Emergency Response.
   4.1. Emergency Procedures.
      4.1.1. AMOPS emergency response actions will be IAW AMOPS QRC #1.
      4.1.2. AFM will notify any affected ATC facility of emergency if such affects their
      operations.
      4.1.3. Any airfield emergency affecting the shared-use portion of the airfield will be
      coordinated with the HIA Airport Operations Manager as soon as possible.
      4.1.4. AMOPS will conduct an airfield check of any emergency area on Hickam Ramp
      immediately upon notification of termination. HIA ramp control will inspect all
      Honolulu areas for foreign object debris upon termination of an emergency. Note:
      AMOPS will coordinate via radio with Honolulu Control Tower for final decision to
      conduct a runway inspection, considering the nature of the emergency and aircraft traffic.
      4.1.5. The Incident Commander for all emergency incidents on the airfield is Fire
      Captain, Battalion Chief, or designated representative. The Incident Commander is
      responsible for crisis management actions IAW with applicable checklists.
 28                                                       15WGI13-204 20 SEPTEMBER 2011


   4.2. Crash Alarm Systems. The Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) and Secondary
   Crash Net (SCN) are means by which emergency information critical to aircraft and airfield
   operations is relayed to base support agencies. These agencies are tasked to respond to
   emergency situations, such as in-flight/ground emergencies or accidents, attempted or actual
   aircraft piracy (hijack), stop alerts, and chemical accidents on the airfield affecting personnel
   safety. These agencies are also tasked to respond to all exercises that occur on the airfield.
   Both systems’ communications will be recorded and maintained for at least 15 days, IAW
   AFI 13-204, Vol. 3.
