       1.4.5.10. Obtaining and maintaining a copy of this publication.

1.5. Norwegian Legal Requirements. In developing this publication, due consideration has been given
to Norwegian legal requirements, applicable labor laws, and labor practices. This information is not
exhaustive and is provided for guidance only, since a summary of the legislation would only be mislead-
ing. Any provisions of this publication which provide better conditions than prescribed by law are part of
the employment contract and will be observed.

1.6. Retained Entitlements. Employees appointed before the date of implementation of this publication
will retain more favorable conditions of employment that were properly authorized by the American

1.7. Discrimination. There will be no discrimination in employment practices based on sex, marital sta-
tus, physical handicap, color, race, nationality, ethnic, or national origin.

1.8. Employee Right of Access to Regulations Affecting Employment. Employees have the right of
access to this publication and other publications affecting their employment. In particular, parts of this
regulation form part of the individual contract of employment, and access must not be denied. Provision
must be made for the publication to be available, normally by the supervisor, or at a place convenient to
the worksite during working hours. Employees are to be allowed access upon request subject to overrid-
ing duty commitments.

1.9. Normal Working Hours and a Week’s Pay. Statutory rights to guarantee payments, unfair dis-
missal compensation, redundancy pay, maternity pay, pay in lieu of notice, etc., require the calculation of
normal working hours and a week’s pay.
   1.9.1. Normal working hours are the number of hours a week for which the employee is employed,
   and are shown on the appointment document or any subsequent amending document.
   1.9.2. A week’s pay is defined as the amount payable for normal working hours where an employee’s
   hours of work do not vary from week to week. Where employees are required to work on days of the
   week or times of the day which differ from week to week so that the remuneration for any week varies
   accordingly, the calculation of a week’s pay will be the average of the last 12 complete weeks. Any
   weeks where no remuneration was payable will not be counted and will be replaced by earlier weeks
   to bring the number up to 12.

   than Saturday, in which case that day ends the week.

                                         FILLING POSITIONS

2.1. General. Norwegian legal requirements in filling positions will be observed. These include employ-
ment of minors, disabled persons, aliens, and European Union and European Economic Agreement (EEA)
citizens; and reinstatement rights following military service, nondiscrimination, and nondisclosure of
spent convictions.

2.2. Recruitment Sources. The installation commander decides the most beneficiary sources for recruit-
ment based on the qualification standards for each position. Currently assigned regular employees of the
USAF in Norway will be given strong consideration for filling positions. Qualified applicants from out-
side sources will be considered for recruitment, with strong consideration being given to temporary and
intermittent employees as well as to former regular employees. Outside sources may include, but are not
limited to, Department of Employment facilities, schools, colleges, universities, trade, commercial, and
ex-service organizations. Newspaper advertisements, posters, and bulletin board notices may also be
used when necessary.

2.3. Eligibility. All available applicants who meet the qualification standards are to receive equal consid-
eration for employment subject to the following restrictions.
     2.3.1. Citizens of Norway. No restrictions.
     2.3.2. Citizens of the United States. Employment may not be given under this authority even though
     the applicant may hold Norwegian citizenship simultaneously (SA to NATO SOFA, 12-3). EXCEP-
     TION: US citizens that are determined as being ordinarily resident in Norway may be employed in
     non-appropriated fund positions. Under no circumstances are they to fill appropriated fund positions
     (SA to NATO SOFA, 12-3).
     2.3.3. Nationals of European Community countries and nationals of EEA countries. No restrictions.
     2.3.4. Other Foreign Nationals, and Stateless Persons. No restrictions, provided no restriction has
     been imposed as a condition of continued residency in Norway. Otherwise, a valid work permit must
     be held or obtained before employment.

2.4. Employee Categories.
     2.4.1. Full-Time Employment. The nature of action (NOA) for appropriated fund employment is
     “Excepted Appointment.” The NOA for nonappropriated fund employment is “Regular Full-Time
     Employment.” This category includes employees hired for a period of 52 weeks or more and for a
     regular workweek of 35 hours or more.
     2.4.2. Part-Time Employment. The NOA for appropriated fund employment is “Excepted Appoint-
     ment.” Work schedule will be “P” in item 32 of SF 50, Notification of Personnel Action. The NOA
     for nonappropriated fund employment is “Regular Part-Time Appointment.” This category includes
     employees hired for a period of 52 weeks or more and for a regular workweek of less than 35 hours.

USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                              13


   exceeding 51 weeks for a regular workweek of 35 hours or more. Norwegian labor law may impose
   additional restrictions on the employer’s flexibility to hire temporary employees.
   2.4.4. Temporary Part-Time Employment. The NOA for appropriated fund employment will be
   “Excepted Appointment-NTE (date).” Work schedule will be “P” in item 32, SF 50. The NOA for
   nonappropriated fund employment will be “Temporary Part-Time Appointment-NTE (date).” This
   category includes employees hired for a period not exceeding 51 weeks and for a regular workweek of
   less than 35 hours. Norwegian labor law may impose additional restrictions on the employer’s flexi-
   bility to hire temporary employees.
   2.4.5. Intermittent Employment. The NOA for appropriated fund employment will be “Excepted
   Appointment.” Work schedule will be “I” in item 32, SF 50. The NOA for nonappropriated fund
   employment will be “Intermittent Appointment.” This category includes employees hired for jobs on
   a “casual,” “as required,” or “on call” basis, with no regular work hours. Intermittent employees
   required to work on a continuous basis for any number of hours each week are to be converted to
   part-time appointments. Norwegian labor law may impose additional restrictions on the employer’s
   flexibility to hire temporary employees.
NOTE: Temporary appointments may be renewed indefinitely for employees who have passed the state
retirement age of 67. The renewal of appointments for those under state retirement age is not prohibited
provided employees are not filling a permanent position and the renewal meets a genuine, but temporary,
management need. Norwegian labor law may impose additional restrictions on the employer’s flexibility
to hire temporary employees.

2.5. Employment Requirements.
   2.5.1. Age Restrictions. Age limits are 15 years minimum (minimum school leaver age) or 70 maxi-
   mum, subject to the following exceptions:
       2.5.1.1. Exceptions to the maximum ages may be made, but appointments can only be temporary
       (paragraph 2.4.). Such appointments are time limited, but for this purpose may be renewed with-
       out restriction, depending upon management needs, employee wishes, and physical condition.
       Certification of employee health may be required whenever this is considered to be necessary, and
       the employee will be required to provide this certification at his or her own expense. For retention
       of current regular or indefinite employees beyond the retirement age (paragraph 9.2.).
       2.5.1.2. Persons under 18 years of age may not be employed in any position involving the sale or
       serving of alcoholic beverages.
       2.5.1.3. Former USF employees who have passed normal retirement age and who are in receipt of
       a pension paid by the US Forces Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, may be hired subject to the
       prior approval of the USAFE Pension and Life Assurance Scheme trustees. An exception may
       also be made, without regard to age, if the pension was awarded for disability, and the disability
       has since ceased to exist.
   2.5.2. Medical. Applicants for positions involving physical contact with people, driving vehicles,
   heavy lifting, operating hazardous machinery, or working at heights, must be prepared to submit to an
   initial and periodic physical examinations, including any necessary immunizations. The health care
   provider conducting the pre-employment examination may render a recommendation to hire, or not to
   hire, based on medical findings. The provider will base this recommendation on the physical require-
   ments of the job for which the applicant is applying. During periodic examinations, if a medical prob-
14                                                                      USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


     lem is disclosed which would place the employee at a health risk, the provider will recommend he or
     she be at least temporarily removed from the job pending a comprehensive medical investigation of
     the problem. Other applicants with medical histories, physical handicaps, or who otherwise fail to sat-
     isfy the supervisor as to their fitness to carry out the work, will also be required to undergo physical
     examinations. All such examinations, including immunizations, are to be administered without cost
     to individuals and are subject to their consent, by or with the approval of a US federal medical officer.
     2.5.3. Qualification Requirements.
        2.5.3.1. Qualification standards will be developed locally by civilian personnel specialists and
        management officials. Position titles and grades appropriate to the positions, as determined by the
        classification specialist, are to be clearly marked on the individual standard. When a standard is
        developed by other than RAF Mildenhall CPF, a copy should be sent to that office for consider-
        ation.
        2.5.3.2. Qualification standards are the minimum experience, training, education, and physical
        requirements essential in performing duties of the position involved in a satisfactory manner. In
        applying physical standards, the criterion is the ability of employees to perform their duties in a
        satisfactory manner and without hazard to themselves or to others with sole reference to job envi-
        ronmental demands. All placement actions are subject to the use of qualification standards.
        2.5.3.3. If it is not possible to find qualified applicants to fill a job vacancy, consideration should
        be given to restructuring the position, including filling at a lower grade with a trainee. If these
        procedures are not appropriate or do not produce a qualified applicant, the servicing CPF may
        request a waiver or substitution of the qualification standard by RAF Mildenhall CPF on a
        case-by-case basis. Full justification must be provided in support of each request.
     2.5.4. Investigative Requirements. Initial appointment and retention in employment is subject to sat-
     isfactory completion of suitability inquiries.
        2.5.4.1. Normal pre-employment investigative requirements are in paragraph 2.7.
        2.5.4.2. Prior to entrance on duty, the applicant will be required to provide a police record check
        (politiattest). All employees will be subject to a routine security check during the probationary
        period.
        2.5.4.3. The investigative process for applicants filling sensitive positions involving access to
        classified information or unescorted entry into restricted areas is contained in AFI 31-501, Person-
        nel Security Program Management.
NOTE: Unless specifically excepted (AFI 31-501), LN employees will not be placed in positions involv-
ing access to classified information or unescorted entry into restricted areas. The cost-saving factor will
not be used as the basis for justification of such a request.
     2.5.5. Suitability. Employment may be denied or terminated during trial period based on information
     obtained during the investigative process. Such action may be based on intentionally false, deceptive,
     or fraudulent verbal or written information provided by the applicant or employee for the purpose of
     obtaining employment; the deliberate withholding of adverse information; or conduct contrary to the
     best interests of the US Air Force. Sources of such information are always to be protected and not
     made known to the applicant or employee.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                                  15


2.6. Family Relationships. Close relatives will not be placed in positions where a supervisory relation-
ship exists, favored terms could ensue, or where the job relationship increases the potentiality of collu-
sion. Close relatives are considered to be father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, first
cousin, nephew, niece, husband, wife, grandparents, father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daugh-
ter-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsis-
ter, half brother, and half sister.

2.7. Appointment Criteria.
   2.7.1. In order to be considered for employment, an applicant must first of all submit to the CPF a
   completed application form, SF 52, Request for Personnel Action (Appropriated Funds), show
   basic suitability, and meet the minimum qualification standards laid down for the positions in which
   interested.
   2.7.2. Prior approval of the civilian personnel officer is required in those cases where adverse infor-
   mation is available. Such information includes, but is not limited to, previous convictions, dismissal
   under other than honorable conditions from a military force, separation for cause by a previous
   employer, or any other information which would give cause to believe that employment might not be
   in the best interest of the US Air Force. Offenses for which the applicant served a rehabilitation
   period, during which no further conviction occurred, are referred to as spent convictions and are not to
   be considered, nor are applicants to be expected to disclose spent convictions.
   2.7.3. Personal testimonials, military discharge papers, bank references for self-employed persons,
   and school references, may be used to determine an applicant’s skills, abilities, demonstrated perfor-
   mance, personal characteristics, etc. At the discretion of the CPF, additional vouchering may be deter-
   mined appropriate for applicants selected for specific job categories, sensitive positions, or where
   duties involve childcare, custodial, or fiscal responsibilities. If vouchering is required, every effort
   will be made to complete such vouchering prior to employment or during the trial period. Vouchering
   may be completed by letter to previous employers or referees. Persons to be employed in sensitive
   positions or duties involving custodial or fiscal responsibilities are to be vouchered before appoint-
   ment. Other applicants may be appointed prior to completion of the vouchering process at the discre-
   tion of the civilian personnel officer, in which case vouchering is to be completed at the earliest
   practicable date, and before the end of any trial period. Vouchering of temporary and intermittent
   applicants is not usually necessary.

2.8. Trial Period. All newly-appointed regular employees are to serve a trial period of six months. At
the time of employment, the employee must be notified in writing of the trial period and that the trial
period may be extended due to the employee’s absence during the trial period. Once the trial period has
begun, if, at the employer’s discretion, an extension period is warranted due to the employee’s absence,
the employee must be provided a written notice of the intent to extend the trial period. The extension can-
not exceed the period of absence. Once having satisfactorily completed a trial period, an employee will
not be required to serve a new trial period, except after a break in service of more than 90 days and return-
ing to a position not similar to the position previous served in. When returning from absence due to sick
leave or maternity leave, no trial period is required. Reappointment of a former employee who returns to
duty from compulsory military service is excluded from trial period requirements. An unsatisfactory
employee may be terminated from service during the trial period with a 2-weeks notice, otherwise the
notice periods shown in paragraph 9.11. will apply. A redundant employee accepting an alternative offer
of employment is entitled by law to a trial period. For details see paragraph 9.12.9.
16                                                                   USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


2.9. Equal Employment Opportunity. Nondiscrimination policy in Norway is very similar to that in the
United States, and observance of US principles will normally suffice to ensure compliance with Norwe-
gian law. In the event of significant differences between the two policies, Norwegian laws regarding non-
discrimination in employment practices prevail.

2.10. Right to Search. Employees may be subject to search by competent authorities on entering or leav-
ing the installation or a building within the installation. Search may be made of the person, vehicle, bag,
package, or other items being carried by that person. Search may be for the purpose of detecting loss of
goods and materials or for locating explosive or incendiary devices. Failure on the part of an employee to
submit to a search may be grounds for denial of entry to a building or installation, and may also be suffi-
cient grounds for dismissal action.

2.11. Reinstatement. Employees who are re-appointed within 90 days following separation from regular
or indefinite employment inside or outside Norway with any US government agency will be reinstated.
They will retain and accrue benefits as if they had been in a leave without pay status during the break in
service (see paragraph 4.5. for pay setting procedures). NOTE: The referenced benefits are those pro-
vided by USF as a condition of employment. Statutory benefits, such as redundancy pay and maternity
pay, continue to be based on the appropriate legislation and are not subject to this paragraph.

2.12. Rehire. Employees who are separated from regular or indefinite employment with the US govern-
ment and then re-employed, but do not qualify for reinstatement, will be considered as rehired. These
employees will be considered the same as newly-appointed employees except that previous service inside
or outside Norway will be creditable for length of service recognition and may be used for purposes of
pay setting (paragraph 4.5.).

2.13. Promotion. The USAF endeavors to provide opportunities for advancement and career develop-
ment of employees who demonstrate potential for higher levels of performance.

2.14. Temporary Promotion. Temporary promotions should be avoided but may be used to fill a posi-
tion temporarily vacated by an employee. The personnel action document will state in the remarks col-
umn that the promotion is temporary; that the employee will revert to his or her original grade and pay
step (plus any within grade increase due during the period of temporary promotion) at the end of the
period; and that selection for temporary promotion does not imply preferential treatment as regards per-
manent promotion. A temporary promotion will not exceed 51 weeks.

2.15. Detail.
     2.15.1. A detail is the temporary assignment of employees to perform duties of a position different
     from those to which normally assigned. Details are only intended to meet temporary needs such as
     emergencies caused by abnormal workloads, organizational changes, absences, or for training pur-
     poses. Except for brief periods, employees will not be detailed to perform work of a higher-grade
     level.
     2.15.2. Employees on detail continue to receive the pay of the position to which they are regularly
     assigned.
     2.15.3. Details of up to 4 weeks in duration need not be notified to the CPF but must be noted in
     supervisor’s records. Details in excess of 4 weeks will be documented on a personnel action request
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                             17


   form (SF 52, or AF 2548, NAFI Request for Personnel Action) and forwarded to the CPF for filing
   in the employee’s personnel folder. Details in excess of 13 weeks are not authorized.

2.16. Reassignment. A “reassignment” is the change of an employee from one position to another, with-
out promotion or demotion. Provided an employee meets the qualification standards of the new position,
he or she may be reassigned without regard to the length of time spent in the old position.

2.17. Change to Lower Grade.
   2.17.1. A “change to lower grade” may be effected for any of the following reasons:
       2.17.1.1. When an employee’s position is downgraded by reclassification action.
       2.17.1.2. When employee is unable to perform the duties of his or her position, and a lower grade
       position for which he or she is qualified is available.
       2.17.1.3. In a reduction-in-force (RIF), when assignment to a lower grade position is the only
       alternative to separation.
       2.17.1.4. Upon the voluntary written request of an employee for assignment to an established
       lower grade position for which he or she qualifies.
       2.17.1.5. Upon completion of a temporary promotion.
   2.17.2. A change to lower grade for the reasons given in paragraphs 2.17.1.1., 2.17.1.2., and 2.17.1.3.
   is defined as an adverse action and is subject to the procedures outlined in paragraph 9.23.

2.18. Changes Between Different Types of Funds. Movement between funds (that is, appropriated and
nonappropriated funded activities, and between nonappropriated funded activities) will be effected as if
the employee was continuously employed. Leave balance and accrual rates, and other authorized benefits
and entitlements will be retained, assuming no break in service occurs in excess of 90 days. Since there
can be no transfers of funds between non-appropriated and appropriated fund organizations in support of
such moves, efforts should be made to reduce annual leave to a minimum before such transfer. However,
undue hardship should not be caused to the employee concerned or the gaining or losing activity. It is not
necessary for the employee to resign his or her previous position. A combined separation-appointment
action should be effected. The remarks section of the SF 50 or AF Form 2545, NAFI Notification of Per-
sonnel Action, should state the amount, in hours, of annual leave to be transferred and should also state
that full credit is given for prior service and quote this paragraph as the authority. NOTE: US citizens
may not move from a position paid from nonappropriated funds to one paid from appropriated funds.

2.19. Written Particulars of Terms of Employment. All employees will be issued a written statement
of their conditions of employment. The statement is to be completed upon appointment and attached to
the employee’s copy of appointment and conversion documents SF 50, for appropriated fund employees;
and AF Form 2545, for nonappropriated fund employees.
   2.19.1. Appointment and conversion documents (SF 50 and AF Form 2545) are to have the following
   information shown in the remarks column. The remarks shown at paragraph 2.19.1.1. is not to be
   used if appointment is to intermittent employment.
       2.19.1.1. The form SF 50 or AF Form 2545 and the pertinent provisions of this directive consti-
       tute the following written statements.
18                                                                      USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


        2.19.1.2. The identity of the parties.
        2.19.1.3. The location of the workplace.
        2.19.1.4. Duty title or a short description of the work.
        2.19.1.5. Effective date of the appointment.
        2.19.1.6. If the appointment is temporary, state expected duration.
        2.19.1.7. Annual leave entitlement (21 work days for personnel under 60 years of age and 26
        work days for personnel 60 years and above), conditions for leave payment, the rules for schedul-
        ing leave.
        2.19.1.8. Length of notification if employment is terminated.
        2.19.1.9. Agreed pay and when payments will be made.
        2.19.1.10. Hours of Duty, 37.5, Monday to Friday, 0800-1600. If duty hours vary, insert weekly
        total hours with the statement “as rostered.”
        2.19.1.11. Trial period.
        2.19.1.12. Free life insurance coverage is provided from date of hire. Other insurance (pension
        plan and accident insurance). NOTE: Figures shown in paragraph 2.19.1.7. parenthesis above are
        sample figures only.
     2.19.2. When conditions of employment change, written amendment to the terms of employment is to
     be issued.

2.20. Procedures. To the extent possible, procedures in use for US citizen employees will be used in
soliciting and filing of applications and in the vouchering, referring, interviewing, selecting, and process-
ing involved in filling positions. In situations where procedures in use for US citizen employees would
conflict with Norwegian employment law and practices, sound judgment is to be exercised by civilian
personnel officers in varying these procedures to suit local circumstances.

2.21. Documentation. The following forms will be used for the purposes indicated:
     2.21.1. USAFE Form 228, Application for Local National Direct Hire (LNDH) Employment with
     the United States Air Force in the United Kingdom. The form is applicable for the direct hire
     employment program in Norway. It is used to record information necessary on a prospective
     employee at the time application is made for employment. It is prepared by the employee concerned
     and completed by civilian personnel flight staff. Only the original is required, which is filed initially
     in the applicant supply file within the personnel office, and finally in the employee’s personnel folder.
     2.21.2. USAFE Form 285, Sickness Absence Self-Certificate (Local National Direct Hire
     Employees in the United Kingdom). The form is applicable for the direct hire employment program
     in Norway. It records information on an employee’s absence due to sickness or injury. It is initiated
     by supervisors when employees notify them of absence on the first day. The employee enters duration
     of illness following return to work and the supervisor then completes the form. It is forwarded to the
     servicing personnel management specialist if the supervisor suspects malingering; otherwise, it is sent
     directly to the payroll office for retention and possible review in the event of repeated absences.
     2.21.3. AF Form 2548, NAFI Request for Personnel Action (Non-Appropriated Funds).
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                             19


   2.21.4. AF Form 2545.
   2.21.5. SF 50.
   2.21.6. SF 52.
   2.21.7. AF Form 971. This form will be maintained in accordance with AFPAM 36-106.
   2.21.8. AF Form 1065, Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) Civilian Position Description; and AF
   Form 1378, Civilian Personnel Position Description. Used to record the employee’s duties and
   responsibilities. One copy is maintained in the employee’s official personnel folder, one with AF
   Form 971, and one in a master file maintained by the CPF. One copy is provided to the employee.

2.22. Orientation and In-Processing of Employees. Both the CPF and the supervisor are responsible
for the orientation of employees. Since first impressions employees gain will influence their subsequent
attitudes, it is essential that orientations be conducted in a congenial atmosphere and be informative. It
should not be forgotten that common military expressions can be difficult to understand, and various cus-
toms and ways of doing business will be alien to many new employees. Procedures for orientation will be
established by the CPF. Both orientation and in-processing are considered duty time and employees
should be in pay status for this period.

                                     POSITION CLASSIFICATION

3.1. General.
     3.1.1. The commander as the delegated authority for civilian personnel administration has the author-
     ity and responsibility for the classification of LN positions. The commander delegates classification
     authority to the civilian personnel officer. The commander is advised by the civilian personnel officer
     and position classification specialists who perform the actual classification of civilian positions on
     behalf of the commander.
     3.1.2. Before a position is established and filled, the title and grade level will be determined by the
     position classification process, as outlined in this chapter.

3.2. Categories of Positions.
     3.2.1. Schedule Title.
        3.2.1.1. Staff Schedule (S). This category includes clerical, administrative, technical, and profes-
        sional positions. These positions are classified by reference to Office of Personnel Management
        (OPM) General Schedule standards.

3.3. Classification Reviews. Supervisors are responsible for periodic reviews and certification of all
civilian positions to assure the currency and accuracy of the position description. The CPF is responsible
for the review of all civilian positions to assure the accuracy of the classification.

3.4. Advisory Classification. Advisory classifications may be requested from HQ USAFE/A1CP. Clas-
sification determinations furnished by HQ USAFE/A1CP are binding and final.

3.5. Classification Appeals.
     3.5.1. Employee Appeals.
        3.5.1.1. Employees may appeal the classification of their position at any time.
        3.5.1.2. Employees who are dissatisfied with the classification of their positions should discuss
        these dissatisfactions with the supervisor and the servicing CPF in an initial effort to resolve the
        classification issue. Since the classification of positions is determined by reference to the OPM or
        USAF Classification Standards, the employee and supervisor should review these in examining
        whether or not the employee has a sound basis for dissatisfaction. The CPF will make available
        copies of standards or other pertinent information as requested.
        3.5.1.3. In situations where the explanation given by the supervisor and CPF does not satisfy the
        employee, a formal appeal may be filed. The appeal must be in writing and contain the following
        information:
            3.5.1.3.1. The employee’s full name, organization, duty telephone number, and present title,
            pay plan, and grade of the position to which officially assigned.
            3.5.1.3.2. A statement indicating the part of the classification with which the employee dis-
            agrees (that is, title, pay plan, or grade); why the assigned classification is inconsistent with
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                                 21


           classification standards or guidelines; and (in terms of the same criteria) the title or grade the
           employee considers correct and the reasons therefore. A contention that the classification of
           an employee’s position is inconsistent with that of another position is not an acceptable basis
           for a classification appeal.
           3.5.1.3.3. A detailed position description (original and one copy) prepared in collaboration
           with the supervisor. The description should be sufficiently detailed so that a person unfamiliar
           with the position can understand what is done and how it is done. The CPF will review the
           position description with the employee and the supervisor and revise the description as
           required to ensure accuracy and obtain clarification as necessary. The employee, the supervi-
           sor, and the CPF will certify the description as complete and accurate. A complaint concern-
           ing the accuracy of a position description is processed under the grievance procedure rather
           than the classification appeal procedure.
           3.5.1.3.4. A current organizational chart which clearly reflects the location of the position
           being appealed in relation to other positions in the organization; and a functional statement for
           the organizational unit in which the position is located. Both of the documents will be
           approved, signed, and dated by a management official above the immediate supervisory level
           of the position being appealed.
       3.5.1.4. The CPF will determine whether or not the appeal meets the above requirements. When
       the above requirements are not met, the CPF will return the appeal to the appellant with a written
       explanation of the deficiencies. When the above requirements are met, the CPF will forward the
       entire case file to HQ USAFE/A1CP for a final decision. HQ USAFE/A1CP will review the
       appeal and issue a decision within 30 days of receipt. This decision is the final US Air Force deci-
       sion.

3.6. Management Disagreements. In the event that the supervisor disagrees with the classification of an
employee’s position, an explanation for the assigned classification may be sought from the CPF. The
supervisor may also review the classification guidelines used in classifying the position. If the supervisor
still believes the position is not properly classified, the supervisor may submit a written request for recon-
sideration with the appropriate reasons. The classification of the position will be re-examined by the CPF
and written results of the review will be forwarded to the supervisor.

                                                 Chapter 4

                                         PAY ADMINISTRATION

4.1. Establishment of Wages and Salaries. It is the USF policy to establish wages and salaries based on
prevailing rates for comparable levels of positions in the private and public sectors of industry and appli-
cable statutory requirements of the US government. Surveys or other means of updating the pay scales
are conducted annually. Pay schedules for Norway are established by the CPF at RAF Mildenhall, and
apply to all direct hire local national employees as described in paragraph 1.1. Annual updates are con-
ducted in the June time frame.

4.2. Pay Periods. The pay period will consist of 2 administrative workweeks (paragraph 6.1.).

4.3. Authority for Pay Actions.
     4.3.1. All requirements for appointment, position change, or pay change must be met and the appro-
     priate notification of personnel action form (SF 52, or AF 2548) completed and submitted to the pay-
     roll office.
     4.3.2. A properly completed and certified time record is required as the basis for payment of wages or
     salaries. Payroll offices will prescribe the type of time record to be used and issue instruction for its
     completion by the supervisor.
     4.3.3. Retroactive pay changes are to be authorized only to correct an administrative oversight, to
     introduce a general pay increase, or when otherwise required by Norwegian law. Personnel actions,
     other than appointments and separations, are normally to be effective at the beginning of the pay
     period following the decision to effect the action.

4.4. Pay Rates.
     4.4.1. Consolidated Rate. This is the rate paid for work performed within the basic workweek as
     defined in paragraph 6.3. It includes any cash allowances, bonuses, and monetary values of in-kind
     payments measured in wage surveys. It is not used in determining premium pay.
     4.4.2. Basic Rate. This rate is used as the base for premium pay computations. It represents the aver-
     age rates measured in wage surveys and used by industry as the base for overtime and shift premium
     calculations.

4.5. Pay Determination on Appointment. New appointments as a general policy will be made at the
lowest step of the pay scale. Exceptions to this general policy may be approved by the CPF as follows:
     4.5.1. Appointees with previous service (appropriated or nonappropriated fund) with the US govern-
     ment, under an appointment for a continuous period of not less than 90 days may be employed at any
     step rate which does not exceed their highest previous rate of pay (including subsequent general
     increases), provided the new appointment is in the same or a closely related line of work. If the high-
     est previous rate of pay falls between two steps of the new grade, the pay may be fixed at the higher
     step. Judicious use of this provision should be made considering such factors as management needs,
     budgetary impact, and quality and recency of previous experience.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                             23


   4.5.2. When an installation experiences recruitment or retention problems in certain positions an
   advanced in-hiring rate may be used. Department of Defense (DoD) agencies collocated in the same
   recruitment area will inform each other when such rates are applied. When it becomes necessary to
   use steps above four (schedule S), coordination must be accomplished with other DoD agencies
   before initiating such action.
   4.5.3. Applicants who have unique qualifications and experience may be hired at any step in recogni-
   tion of such qualifications and service. DoD agencies collocated in the same area will inform each
   other when such action is taken.
   4.5.4. The reason for applying a rate above step one must be documented and cross-referenced on
   appointment documents.
   4.5.5. Whenever an advanced in-hiring rate is used to overcome recruitment or retention problems, all
   current employees filling like positions at the installation for which the advanced in-hiring rate is
   approved will be paid not less than that advanced rate.

4.6. Within-Grade Step Increases.
   4.6.1. Eligibility. All employees qualify for step increases.
   4.6.2. Effective Date. Step increases will be effective the beginning of the next pay period following
   completion of the waiting period. Should the effective date coincide with that of another personnel
   action, the actions will be processed in the order most advantageous to the employee.
   4.6.3. Creditable Service. All continuous service in a pay status is creditable, including periods of
   annual leave, sick leave, maternity leave, and other paid leave, during which an equivalent increase
   was not received. Time served in a non-pay status, or time served before a break in service, does not
   count as creditable service. Exceptions are made for employees who have been reinstated (paragraph
   2.11.), and for the first 2 weeks in each instance of leave without pay (paragraph 5.9.).
   4.6.4. Procedures. Supervisors are to notify the CPF in writing of their decision to approve or with-
   hold a step increase, before the end of the prescribed waiting period. In order to withhold a step
   increase, the written concurrence of the next higher-level supervisor must be obtained, and the CPF as
   well as the employee concerned must be notified at least 4 weeks in advance of the due date. The
   increase may be withheld until performance is judged satisfactory, but not to exceed 6 months. After
   6 months the employees must either be granted the increase, reassigned to another position, demoted,
   or separated.
   4.6.5. Waiting Periods. Age and service requirements for within-grade step increases are shown in
   paragraph 4.15.

4.7. Promotion. A promotion is defined as a change from one position to another when the representa-
tive (step 4) of the new position exceeds that of the old one.
   4.7.1. Equivalent Increase. This is defined as the difference in pay between the grade and step from
   which promoted, and the next higher step of the same grade. For those employees at the top step of
   the grade, an equivalent increase will be the difference between the top step and the next to top step.
   4.7.2. Staff. Pay on promotion will be set at the lowest step in the new grade, which results in an
   equivalent increase. A new waiting period will start for the next within-grade increase, since the pro-
   motion is considered an “equivalent” increase.
24                                                                     USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


     4.7.3. Promotion Following a Downgrade. The pay rate set will be restructured where necessary to a
     rate which does not exceed the rate that would have been reached had the employee not been down-
     graded.

4.8. Change to Lower Grade.
     4.8.1. Employees who are downgraded through no fault of their own and who have completed a trial
     period will be paid at a rate not less than the hourly rate at the time of downgrading. If a step of the
     lower grade does not provide an identical rate the employee will be placed in the next higher step.
     Time spent in the step of the old grade will be credited towards step advancement in the new grade. If
     the highest step in the new grade is less than the rate at the time of downgrading, the employee will be
     paid a retained rate (salary retention).
     4.8.2. Employees on a retained rate will be paid one half of any subsequent pay schedule adjustments
     until the pay schedule equals the retained rate. The retained rate will be discontinued only when
     employees:
        4.8.2.1. As a result of step advancement or a general pay increase, become entitled to a rate in the
        grade to which changed or that equals or exceeds their retained rate.
        4.8.2.2. Are promoted to the original grade or a grade higher than the original grade.
        4.8.2.3. Are offered the original grade or a higher grade and refuse the offer.
        4.8.2.4. Move to another job at their own request.
     4.8.3. Employees who are downgraded through no fault of their own and who have not completed a
     trial period will be placed in that step of the new grade which most nearly preserves but does not
     exceed their present step rate.
     4.8.4. Employees who are downgraded for personal cause will be placed in step one of the new grade.
     4.8.5. Employees who are downgraded at their request may be placed at any step in the lower grade
     that does not exceed present step rate.

4.9. Reassignment or Transfer Between Pay Areas.
     4.9.1. Employees who, in management’s interest, are reassigned or transferred in the same grade to an
     area where higher pay rates apply will retain the same numeric step and credit for step advancement.
     4.9.2. Where lower pay rates apply, the action will be processed as detailed in paragraph 4.8.

4.10. Separation. Upon separation from employment, final pay and allowances will be computed and
handed to employees on the day they would have been paid had employment not been terminated.

4.11. Lump Sum Leave Payment. Payment will be made for unused annual leave upon separation
according to the provision of paragraph 5.2.10.

4.12. Redundancy Pay. Redundancy pay will be determined as a part of a RIF process and shall be equal
to the benefits offered by comparable corporations in Norway.

4.13. Maternity Pay.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                              25


   4.13.1. Maternity Leave will be granted in accordance with Norwegian law.
   4.13.2. The law requires that the employee has spent 6 months in paid employment during the 10
   months immediately prior to confinement.
   4.13.3. The employee has the right to maternity leave with full pay for 42 weeks or for 52 weeks with
   80 percent pay. The leave granted from the Norwegian National Insurance is limited to an annual
   income not exceeding six times the basic amount. The employer will pay the exceeding amount. The
   right to full pay is extended with 5 weeks (7 weeks with 80% pay) for each child born at the same
   birth. Nine weeks must be taken by the mother. Three of these weeks must be taken before the birth
   and 6 weeks immediately after the birth. Of the remaining 33 weeks, 4 weeks must be taken by the
   father and the remaining period can be divided by the parents.
   4.13.4. Employees/Supervisors must contact the nearest National Insurance Office (NIO) for more
   details regarding maternity leave.

4.14. Pay Schedules. Pay schedules are not a part of this regulation but will be distributed separately by
HQ USAFE/A1CP when changes occur.

4.15. Pay Steps and Waiting Periods. Pay increases within a grade are based on a pay step system with
the waiting period between steps being based on time for adults. Pay step increases are effective the
beginning of the pay period following completion of the waiting period.
   4.15.1. Adult rates apply from age 18. The waiting periods for advancement to the next higher step
   are in Table 4.1.

Table 4.1. Waiting Periods for Advancement.
     Waiting Period                 Pay Schedule                      Present Step
1 year                      Staff                          1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
2 years                     Staff                          11,12,13

4.16. Annual Leave Payment. Payment for periods of absence on approved annual leave will be at con-
solidated rates (see paragraph 4.19.3. and 4.19.6. for variations) for that part of the regularly scheduled
tour of duty during which the employee was on leave.
   4.16.1. Annual leave payment will be granted in accordance with Norwegian Vacation Act of 1988.
   4.16.2. Annual leave payment will be 12% of the previous year’s total gross pay including overtime
   pay, minus previous year’s annual leave pay. Employees over the age of 60 shall be paid 14.3% of the
   previous year’s total gross pay minus previous year’s annual leave pay. This is provided that the
   employee reaches the age of 60 before 1 September in the same year the annual leave is being paid.
   4.16.3. Annual leave payment is payable in June and replaces two and a half pay periods for employ-
   ees under 60 and three pay periods for employees over 60 years of age.
   4.16.4. Employees will be paid all outstanding annual leave payment upon separation.

4.17. Advance of Annual Leave Payment. An advancement of pay at consolidated rates may be made
upon employee’s request for approved annual leave of at least one week in duration when the leave has
26                                                                    USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


already been accrued. Employees are to initiate a request to the payroll office through their supervisor not
later than two weeks before the start of the leave period. Should the employee subsequently not proceed
on leave the advance payment is to be recovered.

4.18. Sick Leave Payment.
     4.18.1. General payment for periods of sick leave approved under Norwegian law is made at consol-
     idated rates of pay for the regular scheduled work falling within the period of absence (see paragraph
     4.19.3. and 4.19.6 for variations).
     4.18.2. Employees on approved sick leave will receive their normal pay directly from the employer
     for the duration of the sick leave. In accordance with Norwegian law the first 16 consecutive calendar
     days shall be paid by the employer. After this period the employer will be reimbursed monthly from
     the Norwegian National Insurance the normal salary paid to the employee limited to six times the
     basic amount in accordance with National Insurance Act, paragraph 8-10. In cases where the
     employee’s annual income exceeds six times the basic amount the employer will pay the exceeding
     amount.
     4.18.3. In most cases approved sick leave does not exceed 52 weeks. After 52 weeks, the employee’s
     status normally changes and Norwegian National Insurance will take over the full responsibility. For
     separation during sick leave see paragraph 9.8.
     4.18.4. The employee is responsible for forwarding medical certificates to the employer. Failing to
     produce proper documentation will lead to deduction in pay and may also lead to removal.
     4.18.5. Employees are responsible for notifying the payroll office of payments for sick leave,
     received from the National Insurance.

4.19. Premium Pay and Allowances.
     4.19.1. General. Premium pay and allowances are in addition to normal pay which is payment at con-
     solidated rates for work performed within the basic workweek (paragraph 4.4.). Travel time is not
     considered qualifying work, and will be compensated in accordance with 4.22.
     4.19.2. Overtime. Overtime work is defined as work in excess of the basic workweek or work in
     excess of the regularly scheduled workday. Overtime hours will be paid by the basic hourly rate of
     pay plus an overtime premium supplement as follows:
     Monday through Friday: 50% of the basic hourly rate of pay;
     Saturdays and Sundays (starting 0001 Saturday up to 0800 the following Monday) and holidays as
     established under paragraph 6.11.: 100% of the basic hourly rate of pay.
        4.19.2.1. Compensatory Time Off. At management’s option, time off from duty for performance
        of overtime work may be granted with 1 hour of compensatory time allowed for each hour of over-
        time worked. Overtime premium supplements as established under paragraph 4.19.2. may not be
        compensated by time off.
        4.19.2.2. Overtime must be approved by the supervisor and overtime approving official in
        advance of the work being performed or, in case of emergency work, on the next working day.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                             27


   4.19.3. Holiday Pay. For approved work performed on a holiday as established under paragraph
   6.11., holiday hours will be paid by the basic hourly rate of pay plus a holiday premium supplement of
   100% of the basic hourly rate of pay.
       4.19.3.1. Compensatory Time Off. At management’s option, time off from duty for performance
       of holiday work may be granted with 1 hour of compensatory time allowed for each hour of holi-
       day worked. Holiday premium supplements as established under paragraph 4.19.3. may not be
       compensated by time off. When compensatory time is taken for any overtime worked (paragraph
       6.8.) Monday through Friday payment will also be made at the rate of fifty percent of the
       employee’s regular rate of pay for each hour worked.
   4.19.4. Sunday or Rest Day Pay. For approved work performed on a Sunday or rest day as established
   under paragraph 6.6., Sunday or rest day hours will be paid by the basic hourly rate of pay plus a Sun-
   day or rest day premium supplement of 100% of the basic hourly rate of pay.
       4.19.4.1. Compensatory Time Off. At management’s option, time off from duty for performance
       of Sunday or rest day work may be granted with 1 hour of compensatory time allowed for each
       hour of Sunday or rest day worked. Sunday or rest day premium supplements as established under
       paragraph 4.19.4. may not be compensated by time off.

4.20. Relationship Between Premium Payments. Employees meeting the requirements for more than
one type of premium rate for the same period of work will not be paid compensation under each of the
premium rates, but will be paid at the highest rate applicable for that period of work. Allowances are not
subject to this restriction. Premium pay computations are always based on the basic hourly rate of pay.

4.21. Guaranteed Pay.
   4.21.1. Employees (other than intermittent employees) who have at least 1 month of continuous ser-
   vice, will be compensated at a rate not less than that which is appropriate for the weekly tour of duty
   shown on their current employment contract (SF 50 or AF Form 2545), provided that during all nor-
   mal work hours of that tour of duty they are capable of and available for work (or on approved
   absence in pay status) and willing to perform such duties outside their normal occupation as may rea-
   sonably be required when normal work is not available.
   4.21.2. Employees may be laid off work (furloughed) in a non-pay status only when unforeseen cir-
   cumstances beyond the control of the employer (such as fire, equipment breakdown, flood, or power
   failure) preclude continuation of work and compensation temporarily. In these circumstances, com-
   pensation is not to be suspended until expiration of 5 clear calendar days notice in writing. Guaran-
   teed pay provisions are then suspended, until the reason for layoff has ceased to exist.

4.22. Payment for Travel Time.
   4.22.1. When travel outside of the employee’s normal work hours is unavoidable and falls on week-
   ends, holidays, or regularly scheduled days off, employees are to be paid at consolidated rates, or
   given compensatory time off for travel of up to 7.5 hours in 1 day.
   4.22.2. When calculating travel time, the travel voucher times will be used to determine pay or com-
   pensatory time off.

4.23. Advance Pay. At the discretion of the servicing civilian personnel officer, employees experiencing
financial distress may be granted pay for hours worked since last pay period, not to exceed the hours
worked at the time payment is made.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                               29


                                                Chapter 5

                                     LEAVE ADMINISTRATION

5.1. Explanation of Terms.
   5.1.1. Leave Year.
       5.1.1.1. For employees paid from appropriated funds the leave year is the period from the begin-
       ning of the first complete pay period in January of a year to the beginning of the first complete pay
       period in January of the following year.
       5.1.1.2. For employees paid from nonappropriated funds the leave year is the period from the
       beginning of the first complete pay period in November of a year to the beginning of the first com-
       plete pay period in November of the following year.

5.2. Annual Leave. Annual leave must be administered on a uniform and equitable basis and in accor-
dance with Norwegian law. In granting leave, consideration will be given to the needs of the activity and
the employee. Employees are permitted to use accrued annual leave from the date of appointment.
Although provision exists for unused annual leave to be carried over into the next leave year in some cir-
cumstances (paragraph 5.2.9.), supervisors are to make every effort to ensure employees are scheduled for
leave and so far as possible use their full entitlement each leave year.
   5.2.1. Entitlement. All employees are entitled to 25 days of annual leave per year, with the exception
   of those over the age of 60 who are entitled to 30 days of annual leave per year. The CPF will deter-
   mine the annual entitlement and record it on the appointment document, expressed in work hours,
   rounded up to the next half hour. Leave is earned for hours worked or excused duty in a pay status
   within the basic workweek. Employees whose contract is for less than the basic workweek will be
   given credit for hours worked in excess of contracted hours, provided these are within the basic work-
   week.
       5.2.1.1. Employees Working a Full Basic Workweek on Other Than 5 Days. These employees
       will be credited with the same number of hours leave as their counterparts working a 5 day week.
       The number of days leave will be the total hours credited divided by the length of their workday.
       5.2.1.2. Employees Working Less Than the Basic Workweek. These employees will be credited
       hours of leave in the same proportion as that of their weekly work hours to the basic workweek.
       The number of days leave will be the same as for employees working the full basic workweek on
       the same number of workdays.
   5.2.2. Leave Records. Annual leave is credited to an employee’s leave record at the end of each com-
   plete pay period. Official leave records are maintained in hourly units. Fractions of an hour are used
   in maintaining the records. Leave is normally charged in 1-hour increments, but this may be reduced
   to quarter hour increments where necessary.
   5.2.3. Changes in Accrual Rate. Changes in rate of accrual (i.e., when employees turn 60) are effec-
   tive at the beginning of the first pay period following completion of qualifying service. The CPF will
   prepare AF Form 2545 to record the change.
   5.2.4. Advancement of Annual Leave. Annual leave may be advanced to employees in any amount
   not to exceed the amount that could be earned during the balance of current leave year. Annual leave
30                                                                     USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


     will not be advanced when it is known that the employee’s service will be terminated before the
     employee has been employed for a sufficient period of time to earn the advanced leave. When an
     employee is separated, except in case of death, disability, or disability retirement, any advanced leave
     which has been taken in excess of leave accrued up to the effective date of separation, will be
     deducted from final payment.
     5.2.5. Scheduling Annual Leave. In order to allow employees their annual leave with minimum dis-
     ruption to operations, leave schedules should be established by supervisors early in the leave year.
        5.2.5.1. Generally, employees must be allowed 15 work days (20 workdays for employees 60
        years and above) of their annual vacation during the holiday season (1 June through 30 Septem-
        ber). (§7, Holiday Act of 29 April 1988, no 21).
        5.2.5.2. Leave will be scheduled so as to provide each employee with a vacation period consisting
        of not less than 3 consecutive workweeks in a leave year, provided the employees have sufficient
        annual leave to their credit, or are advanced leave according to the provisions of paragraph 5.2.5.
        5.2.5.3. Annual leave may also be granted for personal or emergency purposes at any time.
     5.2.6. Substitution of Leave. When satisfactory evidence is produced to show that an employee
     became ill while on annual leave, sick leave may be substituted when the employee presents a doctor
     certificate.
     5.2.7. Advance of Pay. Under conditions outlined in paragraph 4.17., an employee may request and
     will be granted advance of pay for annual leave periods of 1 workweek or more when the leave has
     already been accrued.
     5.2.8. Maximum Accumulation. Unused annual leave not exceeding 12 workdays may be carried for-
     ward to the next leave year. Annual leave exceeding 12 workdays at the end of the leave year will be
     compensated at basic rate. Exceptions to this policy are:
        5.2.8.1. When an activity is closing or relocating, and a need exists for employees to work until
        the phase-out, or when an employee is denied leave because of an unusual workload, the limit to
        the amount of annual leave which may be carried over into the new leave year is 12 workdays.
        Prior approval in writing is to be obtained from the commander with delegated authority for per-
        sonnel administration. Employee’s consensus is required in order to carry over leave. Any leave
        approved for carry-over in excess of normal entitlement is to be used within a single leave year
        and is not to be carried over into the next succeeding leave year.
        5.2.8.2. Employees whose contracted hours are less than the basic workweek will have their
        carry-over entitlement based on contracted hours. Any leave earned in excess of this amount must
        be used during the current leave year. Exceptions may be permitted where the excess leave was
        earned after the period covered by the most recent leave statement provided the employee; how-
        ever, the exception will not increase the employee’s carry-over entitlement.
        5.2.8.3. Employees whose employment conditions are changed causing a reduction in annual
        leave entitlement may continue to carry over leave up to the amount previously authorized.
        Should the employee’s accumulated leave at the end of any subsequent leave year be less than this
        amount the carry-over entitlement is reduced accordingly for future years. The final maximum
        will not be less than that authorized for the employee’s current employment conditions.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                               31


   5.2.9. Lump Sum Payment for Annual Leave. At time of separation, lump sum payment will be made
   for unused annual leave remaining to the employee’s credit. In instances where employees are being
   moved between separately funded nonappropriated fund (NAF) positions, the leave will be re-credited
   in connection with the move, and an amount sufficient to cover the employee’s leave balance at the
   time of this movement will be transferred from the losing to the gaining fund.

5.3. Sick Leave. Sick leave in pay status is granted to regular and indefinite employees when they have
been employed for more than 14 days. To qualify for sick leave in pay status, the employee must provide
a medical certificate or issue “Own Notice of Sick Leave.”
   5.3.1. Sick Leave may be granted for the following reasons:
       5.3.1.1. Incapacity for performance of duty by sickness or injury.
       5.3.1.2. Reasons listed in the National Insurance Act section 8.4 paragraph 2.
   5.3.2. Own Notice. To be eligible to issue “Own Notice” the employee must have been employed for
   a minimum of 2 months. In the course of a 12-month period the employee can give own notice of
   sickness four times, covering up to 3 calendar days at a time. If the employee is sick on the fourth cal-
   endar day (or first working day following the expiry of the 3-day period) the employee must provide
   a medical certificate. If the employee fails to do so, the employee loses the right to sick leave for the
   3-day period (National Insurance Act Section 8-24). The fifth own notice in the course of a 12-month
   period, not including notices which have been documented by a medical certificate from the fourth
   day, will not be accepted, and the employee must provide a medical certificate or the absence will be
   considered unauthorized absence.
   5.3.3. Leave to Look after Sick Children. Employees who are parents or foster parents, who have
   dependent children are entitled to leave of absence in pay status when necessary to attend a sick child.
   The right to leave of absence in pay status, applies up to and includes the calendar year of the child’s
   twelfth birthday. If the child is chronically ill or handicapped and the illness or handicap entails a
   markedly greater risk of the parents’ being absent from work, the right to leave of absence in pay sta-
   tus applies up to and including the calendar year of the child’s sixteenth birthday.
       5.3.3.1. The employee is similarly entitled to leave of absence in pay status, when necessary to
       attend a child under 12 years of age, respectively 16 years of age, if the person responsible for the
       daily supervision of the child is ill (mother/father/day mother/baby sitter).
       5.3.3.2. Leave of absence, in pay status, is limited to a total of 10 days per calendar year per
       employee, but to 15 days if the employee has more than two children in his/her care. Employees
       who are responsible for the care of chronically ill or handicapped children are entitled to 20 days
       leave of absence, in pay status, per calendar year.
       5.3.3.3. Employees who have sole responsibility for the care of children are entitled to leave of
       absence as stated above up to 20 days per calendar year, and up to 30 days if the employee has
       more than two children in his/her care, and up to 40 days if the employee has the sole responsibil-
       ity for chronically ill or handicapped children. (§33A, Worker Protection and Working Environ-
       ment Act of 1977, National Insurance Act section 9-6)
       5.3.3.4. Employees must document their absence with an “Own Notice of Sick Leave” or an OPM
       Form 71 Request for Leave or Approved Absence. The “Own Notice of Sick Leave” can be
       used, covering up to 3 calendar days at a time. If the employee is absent on the fourth calendar day
32                                                                     USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


        (or first working day following the expiration of the 3-day period), the employee must provide a
        medical certificate. (National Insurance Act section 9-6).
     5.3.4. Medical appointments. Time required for medical, dental, or optical examination and/or treat-
     ment should be scheduled, if possible, outside working hours. If such appointments can not be sched-
     uled outside working hours, the employee may be excused without charge to leave or any kind of loss
     of basic pay.
     5.3.5. Procedures:
        5.3.5.1. Employees absent because of sickness are responsible for ensuring their supervisor is
        informed as soon as possible on the first day of absence.
        5.3.5.2. Upon receiving such notification, supervisors are to complete USAFE Form 285, Section
        I.
        5.3.5.3. Should the absence extend beyond 4 days, employees are responsible for obtaining a doc-
        tor’s certificate. This is to be sent to the payroll office through the employee’s supervisor.
        5.3.5.4. When they return to work, employees are to complete USAFE Form 285, Section II, in
        the presence of their supervisor. Employees are not required to state details of their illness.
        5.3.5.5. Following completion of Section II, supervisors are to complete Section III. The form
        will then normally be forwarded to the payroll office for retention. In the event of abuse of sick
        leave, the supervisor will first discuss the situation with the servicing civilian personnel represen-
        tative before deciding on the appropriate action to be taken.
        5.3.5.6. Since the completed USAFE Form 285 contains personal data it is to be regarded as
        strictly confidential and the contents disclosed only to authorized officials.
     5.3.6. Payment for Sick Leave and for Leave to Look After Sick Children. Employees on approved
     sick leave and leave to look after sick children receive their normal pay (see paragraph 4.18.). The
     period in which the normal salary is paid is limited in accordance with the limitation under the
     National Insurance Act of sick pay.
     5.3.7. Abuse of Sick Leave:
        5.3.7.1. Failure to notify the supervisor as soon as possible on the first day of sick absence, with-
        out good reason, may result in the employee being reported as absent without leave or on leave
        without pay, depending on the circumstances. In either case, pay would be withheld and disciplin-
        ary action might also be taken.
        5.3.7.2. When the frequency and pattern of sick leave absence give reason to believe the privilege
        is being abused, supervisors are to interview employees concerned and give them the opportunity
        to explain the circumstances. Should the explanation not be satisfactory, or if no subsequent
        improvement be noted, the supervisor should consult with the servicing civilian personnel repre-
        sentative before taking further action.
        5.3.7.3. Employees may be denied pay by placing them in leave without pay or absent without
        leave status, and disciplinary action, including separation for cause, may be taken in extreme cir-
        cumstances for failing to provide medical certificates in support of extended illness for providing
        deliberately misleading or false information.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                                33


   5.3.8. Separation During Sickness. Employees may be separated while absent because of sickness
   under the provisions of paragraph 9.8.

5.4. Maternity Leave.
   5.4.1. Details concerning maternity leave are laid down in the National Insurance Act of 1997, Chap-
   ter 14.
   5.4.2. The law requires that the employee has spent 6 months in paid employment during the 10
   months immediately prior to confinement.
   5.4.3. The employee has the right to maternity leave with full pay for 42 weeks or for 52 weeks with
   80% pay. The right to full pay is extended with 5 weeks (7 weeks with 80% pay) for each child born
   at the same birth. Nine weeks must be taken by the mother. The mother is entitled to start her mater-
   nity leave 12 weeks prior to confinement and must start the maternity leave not later than 3 weeks
   prior to the date of confinement. Six weeks of the maternity leave must be taken immediately after the
   birth. Of the remaining 33 weeks, 4 weeks must be taken by the father, and the remaining period can
   be divided by the parents. If the father is to use parts of the remaining period, the mother must return
   to work, be in leave status or unable to take care of the child. In addition the father can take up to two
   weeks leave without pay at the time of birth in accordance with the Working Environment Act, para-
   graph 31-2. These two weeks leave must be used to take care of minors at home or to take care of
   mother and child after the birth.
   5.4.4. In cases where the mother dies or is too sick to take care of the child the father has the right to
   maternity leave with pay for the remaining period.
   5.4.5. Employees who adopt children under the age of 15 have the right to maternity leave with pay
   for 39 weeks (49 weeks with 80% pay).
   5.4.6. If the mother is working in a hazardous environment and it is impossible to find other suitable
   alternative work, a “pregnancy leave” will be granted and compensated by the National Insurance.
   5.4.7. The National Insurance Act also opens for other flexible ways of using Maternity Leave,
   among them “Tidskonto”. For further details contact the local NIO.
   5.4.8. In order to exercise the right to take maternity leave, the employee must notify her supervisor,
   in writing, as soon as possible, and at least 1 week before the leave begins if the leave exceeds 2 weeks
   and at least 4 weeks before the leave begins if the leave exceeds 12 weeks, of the fact that she is preg-
   nant, the expected date of confinement and the date on which she intends her maternity leave to com-
   mence.
   5.4.9. According to §65, Worker Protection and Working Environment Act of 4 Feb1977, employees
   will not be dismissed because of pregnancy or for any reason connected with the pregnancy. Should
   employees become incapable of adequately performing their job due to reasons connected with their
   pregnancy they will be offered, in writing, suitable alternative work.
   5.4.10. The total period of paid absence counts as a period of service for statutory purposes such as
   length of notice required for separation, redundancy pay computation or step increase. Under no cir-
   cumstances is the period of maternity leave deemed to be a break in service, and there is no require-
   ment for a further qualifying period of service before granting further periods of maternity leave.

     5.4.11. Parents may take 1 year of unpaid leave when the paid leave expires. For details contact the
     nearest NIO.
     5.4.12. Employees/Supervisors are encouraged to consult the nearest NIO for more details regarding
     maternity leave.

5.5. Military Leave.
     5.5.1. Regular and indefinite full-time and part-time employees will be granted leave with pay, with-
     out charge to annual leave or accumulated compensatory pay up to 15 working days per calendar year.
     Upon receipt of military duty orders the employee must notify supervisor immediately.
     5.5.2. Employees who are members of the Military Reserve Forces and are called-up to full-time ser-
     vice are to be provided the full protection of the Reserve Forces (§65A, Worker Protection and Work-
     ing Environment Act of 4 Feb 1977). This protection includes reservists that volunteer for military
     duty in response to Norwegian Ministry of Defense appeals.
        5.5.2.1. The employee will be placed in a military leave with pay status.
        5.5.2.2. Continuous service prior to, during, and after the period of full-time military service, will
        be considered continuous employment.
        5.5.2.3. Periods of absence will be creditable service for purpose of within grade increases, pen-
        sionable service, and annual leave.
        5.5.2.4. Employees on military leave will not be exempt from RIF.
        5.5.2.5. Employee’s written notification of intention to return to work should be submitted to the
        employer as soon as practically possible.

5.6. Special Leave. Special Leave may be administratively granted to regular and indefinite employees
in the following circumstances:
     5.6.1. Death of Family Member. Up to three workdays, in a pay status, in the event of the death of an
     immediate relative, such as spouse, child, mother, father, and one workday for in-laws, brother or sis-
     ter. An additional day may be granted at the discretion of the leave-approving official in the event of
     extended travel requirements, involvement in the funeral arrangement, or similar justification.

     mally exceed four hours, in a pay status.
     5.6.3. Public Duties. Employees shall be entitled to leave of absence in nonpay status to such extent
     as is necessary in order to comply with statutory requirements to attend to public duties (§33C,
     Worker Protection and Working Environment Act of 4 Feb 1977).
     5.6.4. Employees shall be entitled to leave of absence up to 20 days in nonpay status in order to care
     for a close family member who is terminally ill (dying). (§33B, Worker Protection and Working Envi-
     ronment Act of 4 Feb 1977).
     5.6.5. Guidance from the CPF is to be sought in all situations where denial of time off is being con-
     sidered.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                               35


5.7. Leave Balance on Change in Type of Employment. When employees are changed to intermittent
employment, lump sum payment is to be made for unused annual leave. Should such employees subse-
quently be changed back to full-time (or part-time) employment within 90 days after change to intermit-
tent status, the balance of such leave is to be recredited to their account.

5.8. Leave Records. Leave records for employees are maintained by the payroll office. Payroll offices
will keep employees informed of their leave balance, normally on the pay statement provided the employ-
ees, but not less than at the end of each quarter leave year.

5.9. Leave Without Pay.
   5.9.1. Leave without pay is an approved temporary absence from duty in a nonpay status. It cannot
   be imposed except to cover unauthorized periods of absence. Authorization of leave without pay is a
   matter for administrative discretion. It should normally be granted only where there is a reasonable
   expectation that the employee will return to duty at the end of the approved period.
   5.9.2. Leave without pay up to a maximum of 1 week may be granted even though an employee has
   accrued annual leave to his or her credit. It will only be authorized for periods in excess of 6 months
   in exceptional circumstances. Normally, it will only be approved following the use of all accrued
   annual leave.
   5.9.3. When leave without pay is approved for periods in excess of 2 weeks, activities are to forward
   a personnel action request (SF 52, or AF 2548) to the servicing CPF to place the employee on leave,
   and another request to return the employee to duty.
   5.9.4. Periods of leave without pay in excess of 2 weeks are not counted as creditable service for
   within grade increases, annual or leave accrual, or reduction in force purposes.

5.10. Absence Without Leave. Absence without leave is a non-pay status resulting from management
determination that it will not grant any type of leave (including leave without pay) for a period of absence
for which the employee did not obtain advance authorization or for which the employee’s request for
leave on the basis of claimed sickness has been denied. Absence without leave is normally the basis for
disciplinary action.

                                                  Chapter 6

                                  HOURS OF WORK AND HOLIDAYS

Section 6A—Hours of Work

6.1. Administrative Workweek. The administrative workweek consists of 7 consecutive calendar days
and is used as a unit in computing pay. It consists of the regularly scheduled workweek and the regular
days off. The regular days off are known as the employee’s rest days. Generally the administrative work-
week is identical to the calendar week, beginning on Sunday and ending on the following Saturday.

6.2. Tour of Duty. The tour may be established as any of the 7 days in the administrative workweek.
Weekly hours will not be spread over more than 6 days, and daily hours will not be spread over more than
12 hours. Employees are to be advised of their tour of duty at the time of initial appointment. The normal
tour of duty is scheduled on 5 days, Monday through Friday; however, when this cannot be followed,
employees are to be given 2 consecutive rest days whenever possible.
     6.2.1. In those instances where employees have been hired and/or subsequently employed on a fixed
     tour of duty, any significant change to that tour constitutes a change in conditions of service. This
     requires a personnel action be processed and placed in the employee’s official personnel folder. The
     proposed change should first be discussed with the employee concerned, and agreement sought on an
     effective date. Should the employee not be agreeable to the change, the supervisor should then con-
     sider alternative courses of action before proceeding further. Any formal offer of revised conditions
     of service should be made in writing, and the employee’s acceptance or declination recorded. Any
     decision to separate an employee who declines the offer should only be taken after all alternatives
     have been fully explored, and only if the action is based on sound management reasons.
     6.2.2. Employees who have been hired for a variable tour of duty, recorded on their appointment doc-
     ument with the words “as rostered” or similar expression, or who have been working for a significant
     period of time, may continue to be employed on a variable tour. In these instances, work schedules are
     to be prominently displayed at or near the place of work. They are to cover at least one pay period and
     identify employees by name, denote their actual hours and days of work, rest days, and any require-
     ment for overtime or holiday work. Frequent changes to tours of duty are to be avoided, but employ-
     ees are expected to respond to emergency situations and to fill in for other employees’ absences for
     reasons such as sickness, annual leave, or for temporarily vacant positions. Arbitrary or capricious
     changes are to be avoided, and any significant change (such as from day shift to night shift, or from
     weekday to weekend work) should be handled according to the guidance given in paragraph 6.2.1.
     6.2.3. Any change in scheduled hours or days of work, other than routine changes which employees
     have customarily accepted, is subject to prior coordination with the civilian personnel officer, or his or
     her designated representative, to ensure the propriety of the action. Such coordination should be initi-
     ated in the early planning stages before irrevocable management decisions or commitments have been
     made.

6.3. Basic Workweek. The basic workweek is 37.5 hours for all categories employees. When staff
employees are first-line supervisors of employees in other pay categories, including US citizen employ-
ees, they may be employed on the same basic workweek as those supervised, provided those employees
are in fact required to work the full basic workweek.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                               37


6.4. Overtime. Overtime work is defined as work in excess of the basic workweek or work in excess of
the regularly scheduled workday. According to §49, Worker Protection and Working Environment Act of
4 Feb 1977, overtime can only be used in the following special cases: When unforeseen events or the
absence of employees disturb or threaten to disturb normal operations; when overtime work is necessary
to prevent damage to the plant, machinery, raw materials or products; when there is an unforeseen volume
of work; or when there is an especially heavy workload owing to a lack of specially qualified manpower,
seasonal fluctuations, etc. The workday will not be less than 7 1/2 hours for staff, even though the
employee may not be in pay status for the full basic workweek. Overtime work must be ordered in
advance and approved in writing by a competent authority before being performed, except in cases of
emergency when administrative approval may follow performance. The performance of overtime work
without compensation is not authorized. Employees are expected to work overtime when requested; how-
ever, no penalty can be imposed for refusal unless a requirement to perform regularly scheduled overtime
work was included in the individual contract of employment or subsequent amendment thereto. Premium
rates for overtime work are in paragraph 4.19.
   6.4.1. The employer is free to use overtime work up to 2.5 hours a week (i.e., a total workweek of 40
   hours).
   6.4.2. Overtime exceeding 40 hours total workweek is regulated by law. Maximum total work hours
   plus overtime hours per day is 14 hours; maximum overtime hours per week is 10 hours (not including
   the 2.5 hours as described in paragraph 6.4.1.); maximum overtime hours per consecutive 4 week
   period is 25 hours (not including the 10 hours as described in paragraph 6.4.1. calculated at 2.5 hours/
   week for 4 weeks); maximum overtime hours per year is 200 hours (not including the 120 hours as
   described in paragraph 6.4.1. calculated at 2.5 hours/week for 48 weeks).
   6.4.3. Supervisors and other who hold special positions of responsibility are excluded from this pro-
   tection. They are still protected under the law as to refusal to work overtime.

6.5. Call-back Work. In the event employees are called back after having completed their regularly
scheduled work shift, or are called in to work on a day when work was not scheduled, they will receive 2
hours of straight time pay (whether or not work is performed) plus the appropriate straight time rate or
premium rate for the time actually worked. Payment of 2 hours of straight time pay is also authorized
when employees are scheduled, at the close of business on the last day of their workweek, to work Satur-
day, Sunday or a regular day off and are subsequently directed not to report to work.

6.6. Sunday or Rest-day Work. Employees performing approved work on Sunday outside their regu-
larly scheduled workweek will be compensated at Sunday premium rates of pay or by compensatory time
off for all work performed between 0001 and 2400. Employees who regularly work on Sunday, as part of
their regularly scheduled workweek, will be paid at straight time rates for all time worked, but Sunday
rates will be applied to any work performed on their regularly scheduled day of rest instead of Sunday.
For this purpose, the first rest day in the week will be considered as a day off instead of Sunday. For pre-
mium rates, see paragraph 4.19.

6.7. Holiday Work. Employees performing approved work on a public holiday will be compensated at
holiday rates of pay for the time worked. All hours in a shift that begin on a holiday, but end on the fol-
lowing day, are considered part of the holiday for pay purposes. Employees are expected to work on hol-
idays when requested; however, no penalty can be imposed for refusal unless a requirement to work on

holidays was included in the individual contract of employment or subsequent amendment thereto. For
premium rates, see paragraph 4.19.

6.8. Compensatory Time. Compensatory time off, on the basis of 1 hour off for each hour worked, may
be granted at management option in lieu of overtime worked Monday through Friday.
     6.8.1. Maximum Accumulation. The maximum number of hours an employee can accumulate is 80
     hours.
     6.8.2. Taking Compensatory Time. Compensatory time should normally be taken within the same
     pay period, but may be taken within 16 calendar weeks following the week in which it was earned,
     otherwise it will be forfeited. Compensatory time must be taken before annual leave.
     6.8.3. Premium pay supplements themselves may not be compensated by time off.

6.9. Meal Breaks.
     6.9.1. No employee will be permitted to work more than 5.5 hours at a time without a meal break.
     6.9.2. Meal breaks will be indicated on the work schedule.
     6.9.3. Meal breaks will be scheduled for not less than 30 minutes or more than 1 hour.
     6.9.4. Meal breaks will not be considered as work time.
     6.9.5. Normally the break will be allowed at the customary time for the meal.
     6.9.6. In those instances where employees are required to remain at their work position and cannot be
     relieved for meals, a period of 30 minutes may be authorized for an on-the-job meal period. Such
     meals are considered time worked, and will be authorized only when it is not reasonably practical or
     economical to provide a normal meal break.

                                                Chapter 7

                                    PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL

7.1. Performance Appraisals. Performance evaluations and appraisals are part of the day-to-day
responsibilities of supervisors. Employees are to be informed of the degree of acceptability of their work
performance and conduct, and afforded a reasonable opportunity to improve less than satisfactory perfor-
mance when appropriate. Supervisors will:
     7.1.1. Establish requirements for satisfactory work performance and conduct.
     7.1.2. Inform employees of their duties and of the quality, quantity, and manner of work.
     7.1.3. Continually evaluate employee performance and discuss with employees desired and actual
     work performance.
     7.1.4. Promptly notify employees in writing of work performance or conduct considered less than sat-
     isfactory and provide prompt written advice on how to improve; accord a reasonable time (usually 90
     days) to improve; and take action to withhold step increase, reassign, demote, or separate employees
     who demonstrate inability or unwillingness to improve.
     7.1.5. Make notes of discussions with employees concerning exceptional or unsatisfactory work per-
     formance or conduct, and file them with the supervisor’s records of the employees. Notes of actions
     taken are also to be made on AF Form 971. The employee’s signature should be sought to acknowl-
     edge the discussion and entry on the AF Form 971.

7.2. Annual Evaluations. Supervisors complete an annual evaluation at the same time on all employees,
both regular and flexible, at a date to be determined by the installation commander. They are due in the
CPF not later than (NLT) 30 days after the close-out period. Employees with less than 90 days of employ-
ment are not evaluated until at least 90 days is completed. If the employee’s supervisor leaves within 90
days of the close-out period, he or she completes the evaluation prior to departure. If the employee’s
supervisor leaves prior to 90 days of the close-out period, the gaining supervisor completes an evaluation
after 90 days of supervision. Evaluations are completed on AF Form 3527, NAF Employee Perfor-
mance Evaluation. Completed evaluations will be filed in employees Official Personnel Folder.

7.3. Trial Period Appraisals. Evaluation of work performance and conduct will be carried out through-
out any trial period according to this Chapter. However, under these circumstances, action to reassign or
separate an employee based on inability or unwillingness to improve may be initiated following any
shorter warning period considered appropriate in the circumstances by the civilian personnel officer.
Supervisors are to make a formal written appraisal of employees before the end of the trial period. This
should be done in sufficient time to allow separation action to be completed before the last day of the trial
period, should this action become necessary (paragraph 9.7.).

8.2. Terms Explained.
     8.2.1. Disciplinary Action. An administrative action taken by management to correct an employee’s
     deficiencies in conduct, attitude, habits, or work methods (hereinafter called a disciplinary offense).
     Included are oral admonishments, reprimands, disciplinary reassignments, and removals. Some disci-
     plinary actions are adverse actions as well (Chapter 9, paragraph 9.21.). When an action is both dis-
     ciplinary in nature and an adverse action, the concepts and procedures of both apply.
     8.2.2. Admonishments. An interview, between supervisor and employee, on the subject of inadequa-
     cies in the employee’s conduct or performance, or his or her failure to observe a rule, regulation, or
     administrative instruction.
     8.2.3. Reprimand. A formal letter to an employee concerning significant misconduct, inadequate per-
     formance, or repeated infractions of a lesser nature.
     8.2.4. Reassignment. Employees may be reassigned to another position for disciplinary reasons when
     their deficiencies make them no longer suitable to fill their current position. Typically, reassignment
     would be from supervisory to nonsupervisory duties. Reassignment may or may not involve a change
     to lower grade.
     8.2.5. Removal. Separation for cause, effected when improvement of performance or conduct is
     improbable or the conduct makes the employee unsuitable for continued employment.

8.3. Responsibilities.
     8.3.1. Commanders and Operating Officials:
        8.3.1.1. Administer in accordance with regulations fair, impartial, uniform, and proper disciplin-
        ary programs within their activities.
        8.3.1.2. Assure that the rules, regulations, and other conditions of employment to be observed are
        made known to all civilian employees under their jurisdiction.
     8.3.2. Civilian Personnel Officers:
        8.3.2.1. Assist commanders, operating officials, and supervisors to assure that all requirements for
        disciplinary actions are met.
        8.3.2.2. Ensure that disciplinary actions comply with applicable laws, regulations, and policy.
        8.3.2.3. Coordinate on all notices of proposed action and final decisions.
     8.3.3. Supervisors:
        8.3.3.1. Maintain an environment, which generates good employee-management relations and
        efficient production.
        8.3.3.2. Keep employees informed of rules, regulations, and standards of conduct, and maintain
        conduct and discipline within the framework of policy and established procedures.
        8.3.3.3. Take all possible steps to prevent situations, which might lead to disciplinary action.
        8.3.3.4. Gather, analyze, and carefully consider all facts and circumstances before taking or rec-
        ommending disciplinary action.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                                 43


       8.3.3.5. Constructively admonish employees individually and in private when circumstances so
       warrant.
       8.3.3.6. Coordinate, sign, and issue notices of proposed and final action; receive and consider
       replies to proposed actions, and assure that all approvals and coordinations of management offi-
       cials, CPF, and other staff agencies required by regulation or policy are obtained. Disciplinary
       actions which are also adverse actions are not normally taken by the first level supervisor (para-
       graph 9.22.).
       8.3.3.7. Defend any disciplinary action taken should the employee contest it.
   8.3.4. Employees. Employees must perform their assigned duties conscientiously; respect the admin-
   istrative authority of those directing their work; and observe the spirit as well as the letter of the laws
   and regulations governing their conduct. The US Air Force does not interfere in the private lives of its
   employees. It does require that their conduct, character, and reputation do not reflect adversely on
   their official position.

8.4. Criminal Offenses Outside Employment. These will not be treated as automatic reasons for dis-
missal. In the event that an employee is charged with or convicted of a criminal offense, the main consid-
eration will be whether the offense is one that makes the individual unsuitable for his or her type of work,
and, if so, whether alternative jobs are available which would be suitable.

8.5. Trade Union Officials. Disciplinary action against a trade union official arising out of the conduct
of trade union business can lead to a serious dispute if it is seen as an attack on the union's functions.
Although an admonishment may be given, no further action should be taken until the circumstances of the
case have been discussed with a senior trade union representative or full-time official. Following such
discussion any further action is to be coordinated with HQ USAFE/A1CP.

8.6. Circumstances Necessitating Immediate Action. In circumstances where the employee's behavior
is such that immediate action is necessary to remove him or her from duty status, the employee shall be
suspended from duty in pay status pending decision on further action to be taken. Suspension in these cir-
cumstances would be most appropriate during night shifts or at remote work sites where no one is present
with the necessary authority to take disciplinary action.

8.7. Uniformity of Disciplinary Actions.
   8.7.1. Attachment 2 is a guide to disciplinary actions.
   8.7.2. In evaluating any disciplinary offense and in selecting an appropriate penalty, careful consider-
   ation must be given to cause and effect factors and mitigating circumstances. For example, consider
   whether the disciplinary offense was accidental or deliberate, provoked or unprovoked, and whether
   the employee had actual or constructive knowledge of expected standards of performance or conduct.
   Also consider whether the consequences of the disciplinary offense were of major or minor signifi-
   cance and whether the employee has been previously disciplined for a similar or other disciplinary
   offense. Consider the work history of the individual and his or her contribution to the activity, reputa-
   tion in the community, and likelihood of rehabilitation.
   8.7.3. Before taking disciplinary action for a second disciplinary offense, it must be determined that
   disciplinary action was taken for the first disciplinary offense. Likewise, before taking disciplinary
44                                                                      USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


     action for a third disciplinary offense, it must be determined that disciplinary action was taken for the
     first and second disciplinary offenses, respectively. The penalty assigned for a given single offense
     should not in the absence of exceptional circumstances exceed the penalty specified by Attachment
     2. However, a more severe penalty than that shown by the schedules for a single disciplinary offense
     may be used to treat a combination of disciplinary offenses collectively.
     8.7.4. An employee may not be disciplined twice for the same disciplinary offense. However, a Letter
     of Reprimand or Removal for a second or subsequent disciplinary offense will list previous disciplin-
     ary offenses and disciplinary actions which are a matter of record.

8.8. Taking Disciplinary Action.
     8.8.1. When the need for disciplinary action arises, the supervisor will promptly gather all facts con-
     cerning the incident and will then inform the employee in private of the nature of the complaint, and
     of his or her right to be accompanied by a representative of his or her choice when a response is made.
     The supervisor will afford the employee an opportunity to explain, and, if the employee's explanation
     is acceptable, will close the interview. If the employee's explanation is unacceptable and an admon-
     ishment is considered appropriate, the supervisor will explain why and how the deficiency can be cor-
     rected or avoided in the future.
     8.8.2. An admonishment should be noted on AF Form 971 and provision made for follow-up action.
     A letter of counseling may be issued and a copy retained by the supervisor for record purposes. The
     employee is to be notified promptly of any observed improvement.
     8.8.3. When a supervisor decides that a case exists for proceeding with more severe disciplinary
     action, his or her supervisor must then decide on the most appropriate penalty. If a penalty other than
     a reprimand is selected the procedures described under Chapter 9, Separations and Adverse Actions,
     apply. When a reprimand is to be given, the supervisor must coordinate with the CPF representative
     when preparing and delivering the notice of reprimand, giving specific and detailed reasons for the
     action. The notice will contain the following information:
        8.8.3.1. A statement that the notice will be filed in the employee's personnel folder but will be
        removed and destroyed two years from the date of the reprimand. (Air Force Records Disposition
        Schedule, Table 36-01, Rule 16)
        8.8.3.2. A statement that a future offense could result in a more severe penalty up to and including
        removal.
        8.8.3.3. A statement informing the employee of grievance rights and the name, telephone number,
        and location of the personnel management representative, who can give further information about
        how to make an appeal or grievance.
        8.8.3.4. A request to indicate receipt by signing and dating a copy of the notice, which will then
        be retained by the CPF in the employee's official personnel folder.
        8.8.3.5. A Letter of Reprimand should be delivered to the employee within five days of the deci-
        sion to issue the letter.

8.9. Recording Actions.
     8.9.1. Copies of reprimands are to be sent to the CPF for retention.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                         45


  8.9.2. Reprimands and admonishments will be treated as expired two years after they are issued.
  Once expired, a reprimand or admonishment cannot be considered as prior disciplinary action in rela-
  tion to any subsequent disciplinary offense and should be ignored when considering the appropriate
  penalty for that subsequent disciplinary offense.
46                                                                      USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


                                                 Chapter 9

                              SEPARATIONS AND ADVERSE ACTIONS

Section 9A—Separations

9.1. Resignation. Employees with at least six months service who voluntarily terminate their employ-
ment are required to give a minimum of one month advance notice (calculated from and with the first day
of the month after the month in which the notice is delivered) in writing, on or attached to a personnel
action request form (SF 52, or AF 2548). Reasons for resignation should be stated in full. Failure to give
the minimum advanced notice may result in refusal to reemploy at a later date. During this notice period,
the employee may reconsider the action and, subject to the agreement of both the supervisor and the civil-
ian personnel officer, may withdraw or postpone the resignation any time up to the effective date. An
employee may not be denied the right to resign even though another type of separation action is pending.
An employee may not be requested to resign. The requirement to give notice of resignation may be
waived in part or in whole provided justification is given, the employee can be spared from duty, and nor-
mal base clearance procedures are followed.

9.2. Retirement. According to local practice, normal retirement age is 67 for all employees, however
employees may choose to work until the age of 70. Notice periods in paragraph 9.11. will be observed.
     9.2.1. Employees may be retained beyond legal retirement age on temporary fixed term appointments
     not to exceed one year. These appointments may be renewed subject to management needs. Certifi-
     cation as to the continuing fitness of the employees may be required in appropriate circumstances, and
     the employees will be responsible for obtaining such certification at their own expense.
     9.2.2. Employees retained on temporary appointments beyond normal retirement age will continue to
     receive the benefits of regular service such as annual leave, sick leave, and notice of separation, based
     on total continuous service.
     9.2.3. Requests for retention are to be submitted to the servicing personnel office three months before
     either the employee attains the stated retirement age, or expiration of the previous temporary appoint-
     ment if already beyond retirement age. Requests are initiated by the employee concerned and are sub-
     ject to the approval of the supervisor and the civilian personnel officer. In the case of employees who
     are members of the pension plan, advance approval must be obtained from the pension fund trustees.
     9.2.4. Employees who are members of the pension plan and who wish to retire up to five years before
     normal retirement date must give three months written notice to the Trustees. Full reasons are to be
     given in support of any request.

9.3. Death. The effective date of separation will be as of close of business on the day of the employee's
death. The employee's supervisor is responsible for obtaining a copy of the death certificate to support
payment of life insurance.

9.4. Termination of Temporary Appointments. Employees terminated from temporary appointments
other than by expiration of appointment will be given advanced notice (but not proposed notice) as
required by paragraph 9.11.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                                47


9.5. Termination of Intermittent Appointments. Employees terminated from intermittent appoint-
ments will be given as much advanced written notice as is possible under the circumstances.

9.6. Separation for Abandonment of Position. Employees may be separated upon determination that
the employee has abandoned the position to which assigned. All reasonable efforts to contact the
employee will be made, and separation action will not be taken until at least seven calendar days from the
date the employee was last on the job. The effective date of separation will be the last day the employee
was on the job. Notice of separation will be mailed to the employee's last known address.

9.7. Separation During Trial or Probationary Period. Advanced notice of separation will be given as
required by paragraph 9.11. and will contain the information indicated in paragraph 9.17.1. The employee
will be given a minimum of three calendar days following receipt of the advanced notice in which to
request a review of the action by a higher level official with authority to cancel the action (paragraph
10.12.). Employees will not be separated for reasons of inefficiency without being given prior notice of
their deficiencies and afforded a reasonable time to correct such deficiencies. Written evidence of prior
notice, receipted by employees, is to be placed in the official personnel folder to avoid any subsequent
claim by employees that they were not properly advised.

9.8. Separation During Sickness. Regular and indefinite employees who are on approved sick leave
cannot be separated due to absences from work caused by sickness while they are under protection of §64,
Worker Protection and Working Environment Act of 4 Feb 1977. Employees with less than five years ser-
vice may be separated when on sick leave for more than six continuous months. Employees with more
than five years service may be separated when on sick leave for more than 12 months. A presupposition
for such separations is that the legal requirements to establish valid grounds under §60, Worker Protection
and Working Environment Act of 4 Feb 1977, are fulfilled. If the reason for sick leave is related to their
employment, the protection period against separation is always at least 12 months (§64, Worker Protec-
tion and Working Environment Act of 4 Feb 1977).
   9.8.1. Separation-Ill Health. When all sick leave has been used, the employee should be placed in
   leave without pay status, and discussion with the employee must take place to find out the true medi-
   cal position, the nature of the incapacity, how long the condition is likely to persist, and likelihood of
   return to work in the short, medium, or long term. Should it appear necessary to verify the facts, the
   employee’s permission must be obtained before consulting with the individual’s doctor and/or arrang-
   ing a fitness for duty medical examination. Should it be decided the employee will be able to resume
   normal duties within a period of time suitable to the supervisor, consideration should be given to hir-
   ing a temporary employee for the period of absence. Should it appear unlikely the employee will ever
   be able to resume normal duties, consideration must be given to placing the employee in a suitable
   vacancy. If no suitable alternative employment is available, the employee may be separated with the
   appropriate notice (or payment instead). Generally, employees separated under these circumstances
   will be given priority consideration for employment when they become fit for duty.
   9.8.2. Separation-Disability. In those instances where an employee claims to be unfit for the work
   (typically heavy work) that the individual was hired to perform, a medical certificate should be pro-
   duced to support the statement. Discussion should take place with the employee to find out whether
   the person would be capable of performing any other jobs currently vacant at the installation. Subject
   to the employee's consent, the employer should seek verification in the form of a report from the
   employee’s medical practitioner in relation to the seriousness of the illness, how long it will last, and
48                                                                       USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


     types of jobs the employee could perform. Should it be agreed by both the doctor and the employer
     that a specific job could be performed, the employee should be offered the job. Should there be no
     vacancy at that time, the individual should be separated with the appropriate notice (or payment
     instead) and advised to notify the civilian personnel office when becoming fit for employment. The
     individual will then be considered when a suitable vacancy arises. Should the disability be serious,
     eligible members of the pension plan should be considered for early retirement based on disability.
     The protection period in paragraph 9.8. applies.
     9.8.3. Permission for Access to Medical Records. Requests for permission for access to medical
     records must be in writing and include a statement advising employees that their consent is voluntary
     and that no adverse action will be taken if the employee chooses not to give the employer any access.

9.9. Pregnancy. An employee will not be separated for pregnancy. Employee is protected against sepa-
ration based on the sole fact that she is pregnant. (§65, Worker Protection and Working Environment Act
of 4 Feb 1977).

9.10. Summary Dismissal. Employees separated for major misconduct may be dismissed without
advanced notice, but only following coordination with the CPF. Typical situations which may justify
summary dismissal are shown in Table A2.1. When requested by the employee a written detailed expla-
nation of the reasons for summary dismissal will be issued not later than 14 days following the request.
The detailed explanation will be issued by the installation commander.

9.11. Involuntary Separation Notice Periods.
     9.11.1. Employees will be given advanced notice of separation unless the reasons justify summary
     dismissal. The notice starts on the first day of the next month unlike separation of trial employees
     which starts when the employee receives the notice, or it is reasonable to believe that notice has
     reached the employee. The minimum notice periods are:
        9.11.1.1. 2 weeks if on trial period.
        9.11.1.2. 1 month if continuous service is at least one month but less than five years.
        9.11.1.3. 2 months if continuous service is five years but less than ten years.
        9.11.1.4. 3 months if continuous service is ten years or more
        9.11.1.5. 4 months if continuous service is ten years or more and the employee is between 50-55
        years old.
        9.11.1.6. 5 months if continuous service is ten years or more and the employee is between 55-60
        years old.
        9.11.1.7. 6 months if continuous service is ten years or more and the employee is above 60 years
        old.
     9.11.2. In the event of separation under reduction-in-force procedures, employees who have com-
     pleted their initial trial or probationary period of six months, but have less than 5 years service, will be
     given not less than one month notice. Employees with five or more years of service will be given the
     notice required by paragraph 9.11.1.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                              49


   9.11.3. After notice has been given, employees may waive their right to all or part of the notice period
   provided this is in the form of a signed statement and is retained in the employee’s official personnel
   folder.
   9.11.4. The civilian personnel officer may authorize pay in lieu of notice only in circumstances where
   retention of the employee in a duty status is not in the best interest of the US Air Force.
   9.11.5. When an involuntary separation action requires a notice of proposed action (paragraph
   9.17.2.), the notice period will commence from the day following the date the notice of final decision
   (paragraph 9.17.3.) is received by the employee.

9.12. Reduction in Force (RIF).
   9.12.1. General Provisions. Management decides what positions are necessary, what positions to
   abolish or change, and how large a reduction to make. Before initiating RIF action, approval is to be
   obtained (paragraph 9.15.), and notification given (paragraph 9.16.).
   9.12.2. The minimum notice periods for separation under RIF are in paragraph 9.11.1.
   9.12.3. Temporary and intermittent employees are not subject to separation under RIF procedures,
   and other reasons are used (termination due to shortage of funds, no further work available, etc.); they
   may be displaced by regular employees who are qualified for the position.
   9.12.4. Employees from different employment groups, i.e., appropriated funds/nonappropriated
   funds, will not compete with one another for retention. Employees paid from nonappropriated funds
   will not compete with US employees paid from same sources.
   9.12.5. Selection of employees to be released will be made from among those occupying positions at
   and below the grade levels of the positions to be canceled. A retention register will be prepared and
   will be based on:
      9.12.5.1. Competitive Area. The competitive area will be the installation at which the RIF action
      is initiated. Employees paid from nonappropriated funds will be in a separate competitive area
      from those paid from appropriated funds.
      9.12.5.2. Competitive Level. A grouping of all positions in a specific competitive area. These
      positions will be so similar in duties, qualification requirements, and grade and employee catego-
      ries (full or part-time) that interchange is feasible without change in terms of appointment, without
      the need for significant training, or without undue interruption of the work program.
      9.12.5.3. Length of Service. Employees with the most recent service computation date will be
      reached first. Creditable service will include prior regular service, inside or outside Norway, with
      a break of 90 days or less in positions with agencies or instrumentalities of the US Government.
      This break may be extended up to 1 year in the event prior service was terminated under RIF pro-
      cedures.
   9.12.6. Preference in retention will be based on length of service. EXCEPTION: Employees having
   statutory retention rights (reinstatement following military service or preservation of the minimum
   legal percentage of registered disabled employees) or where departure from this principle is justified
   in writing by the next higher level official, and approved by the civilian personnel officer.
   9.12.7. Employees reached for RIF have retreat rights to any position within the competitive area
   from which they had been promoted, or for which they meet the qualification standards. They will be
50                                                                    USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


     considered for any vacancies in the commuting area for which they are qualified. If no immediate
     vacancy exists, they will be placed on the reemployment priority list for the commuting area for 1
     year.
     9.12.8. An employee reached for RIF will be notified in writing according to paragraph 9.17. Appeal
     rights and procedures are described in Chapter 10.
     9.12.9. Alternative Employment Under RIF. Employees otherwise entitled to redundancy payment,
     who accept an offer of alternative employment instead of separation under RIF procedures, do not
     immediately lose their right to redundancy pay. They are entitled to an informal trial period of 4
     weeks (or longer if agreed for the purpose of re-training the employee) to enable them to decide
     whether or not it is suitable. If they decide not to continue, or the employer terminates the employ-
     ment during the agreed trial period for a reason arising out of or connected with the change of job,
     rights to redundancy pay are not lost, provided the employee has not unreasonably ended a suitable
     job. Any agreement to extend the trial period beyond 4 weeks shall be in writing and shall specify the
     date of the end of the trial period and the terms and conditions of service which will then apply.
     9.12.10. If an employer is faced with RIF and asks for volunteers, an employee who volunteers and is
     selected for separation does not lose entitlements to redundancy pay.

9.13. Placement Assistance.
     9.13.1. All possible assistance will be given to employees separated under RIF action in obtaining
     further employment. Apart from placing on the reemployment priority list for one year, positive
     efforts made are to include contacting other US Government agencies in the area, investigating the
     employment possibilities with industry, inviting Department of Employment officials to visit the base
     to discuss job opportunities with employees in the event of a major RIF, and any other appropriate
     steps that may assist individuals to locate employment.
     9.13.2. Employees with 2 or more years of continuous service who are being separated under RIF are
     entitled to reasonable time off with pay to seek new employment or to arrange for training for future
     employment.

9.14. Redundancy Pay. Employees whose positions are abolished or significantly changed and who
cannot be offered suitable alternative work, may be entitled to redundancy payment.

9.15. Reduction-in-Force Approval. Prior approval for RIF involving one or more local national
employees is to be obtained from HQ USAFE/A1CP in compliance with EUCOM Directive 30-6, Appen-
dix D.

9.16. Reduction-in-Force Notification.
     9.16.1. The CPF is responsible for providing advance notification in writing to the regional office of
     the Department of Employment at least 90 days before any dismissals involving 100 or more employ-
     ees at one establishment within a 90-day period, or at least 30 days before any dismissals involving 10
     or more employees at one establishment within a 30-day period. A copy of the notice is to be given to
     the representative of any independent trade union recognized as representing the affected group of
     employees.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                              51


   9.16.2. In those instances, where an independent trade union has been recognized as representing the
   employee group affected, even though such recognition is limited to consultation with local manage-
   ment only, and even though the affected employees may not be members of the relevant union, con-
   sultation is required with the union for each proposed dismissal based on redundancy. Advance notice
   of proposed redundancy is given to the union according to paragraph 9.16.1., unless less than ten
   employees are affected, in which case the maximum notice possible is to be given. Union representa-
   tives are to be informed in writing of:
       9.16.2.1. The reasons why employees have become redundant.

Section 9B—Adverse Personnel Actions

9.21. Terms Explained. An adverse action is an involuntary personnel action which:
   9.21.1. Moves employees to another position at a lower grade or to one where their compensation or
   status is reduced.
   9.21.2. Continues an employee’s assignment in a position, which is changed to a lower grade, or oth-
   erwise changed so as to reduce the employee’s compensation or status.
   9.21.3. Places the employee in a nonpay, nonduty status (paragraph 4.21.).
   9.21.4. Separates an employee (Chapter 9, Section 9A).

9.22. Authority To Effect Adverse Actions. Immediate supervisors do not normally sign and issue
notices of proposed adverse actions, consider replies, or issue notices of final decision. This is normally
54                                                                    USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


done by activity managers or higher level supervisors, unless the immediate supervisor is a management
official and also the highest level of management locally available. All such notices will be coordinated
with an official of the servicing CPF. Notices are not to be issued without such coordination.

9.23. Procedures. The procedures to be followed in effecting adverse actions listed under paragraphs
9.21.3. and 9.21.4. are described in the referenced chapters of this publication. The procedures to be fol-
lowed in effecting actions listed under paragraphs 9.21.1. and 9.21.2. are:
     9.23.1. When the action is not based on employee cause, the procedures will be the same as for RIF.
     9.23.2. When the action is based on cause, the procedures will be the same as for removal for cause.
     9.23.3. The effective date of the action will not be earlier than 14 calendar days following receipt of
     the notice.
     9.23.4. When appropriate, notices of adverse action may be combined with notices of separation. For
     example, a full-time employee may be offered part-time employment with the alternative of separa-
     tion under RIF should the offer not be accepted.

        10.3.1.10. Matters which also involve trade unions or local or national government agency repre-
        sentations, or parliamentary or news media inquiries and requests (grievances of this type should
        be referred to the CPF).
     10.3.2. Employees who have not completed their trial periods may not request a hearing. Employees
     submitting appeals will be given a hearing if they so request. If a hearing is requested for a grievance,
     the request may be granted at the discretion of the commander or designated representative, under
     advice from the civilian personnel officer. A hearing will not be granted in relation to a complaint.

10.4. Time Limits for Submission of Grievances and Appeals.
     10.4.1. An appeal involving a separation action may be filed at any time from the date of receipt of
     the notice of decision up to, but not later than, 15 days after the effective date of the separation action.
     10.4.2. Appeals, other than those covered by paragraph 10.4.1. above, and grievances must be filed
     not later than:
        10.4.2.1. 15 days after the date on which the employee learns of a condition which affects him or
        her adversely or;
        10.4.2.2. 15 days after the date on which notification of an adverse decision was received.
     10.4.3. Grievances concerning a continuing practice or condition may be presented at any time.

10.5. Technical Review Procedure. A technical review procedure will be used in resolving any com-
plaint grievance or appeal, where the issues solely concern technical determination and no useful purpose,
would be served by a hearing process with examination of witnesses. For example, the rights granted
administratively to employees affected by a RIF concern technical determinations which can be made by
review of documentation of the action. Similarly, pay matters (effective dates of within-grade step
increases, questions on overtime, etc.) are technical subjects and a hearing with witnesses would only
delay resolution of the complaint. The CPF will be responsible on behalf of the commander for initial
decision as to whether an employee’s complaint will be resolved under the technical review process or the
grievance hearing process. A civilian personnel specialist not involved in the original action will conduct
the review.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                                 57


10.6. Complaint Procedures. An employee should present any complaint orally or in writing to his or
her immediate supervisor who will render an impartial decision within 5 workdays of receipt of the com-
plaint. If the employee is not satisfied with the immediate supervisor’s decision, the immediate supervi-
sor will arrange for a meeting between the employee and the next higher supervisor. If the complaint is
against or relates to the immediate supervisor the complaint should be taken up directly with the next
higher supervisor who will render an impartial decision with 5 workdays of receipt of the complaint. An
employee who is dissatisfied with the decision will be advised of his or her rights to submit a grievance.

10.7. Grievance and Appeals Procedures.
   10.7.1. Grievances must be submitted in writing to the commander through the servicing CPF. The
   grievance must contain a clear and concise statement of the subject matter and the remedial action or
   relief sought; results of discussions with supervisors; and the reasons why he or she believes the action
   or relief sought should be granted and state whether a hearing is desired.
   10.7.2. Appeals must be submitted in writing to the commander and through the servicing CPF. The
   appeal must contain a clear and concise statement why the adverse action should not be taken, the rea-
   sons why the action or relief sought should be granted, and whether a hearing is desired.
   10.7.3. If the grievant or appellant has not requested a hearing, the commander shall, within 10 work-
   days following the receipt of a grievance or appeal, designate a technically qualified military officer
   or civilian employee either to attempt satisfactory resolution of the grievance or appeal through dis-
   cussion with the principals involved, and to assemble and evaluate all available information on the
   case, and recommend appropriate action. If the employee has requested a hearing, the commander
   shall appoint an examiner within 10 workdays for this purpose.
   10.7.4. If the grievance or appeal is not satisfactorily resolved through discussion, or if it is not con-
   sidered practicable to attempt resolution in that manner, and if a hearing was not requested, the com-
   mander shall, on receipt of recommendations from his designated representative, render a decision no
   later than 15 workdays from initial receipt of the grievance or appeal. The employee will be notified
   in writing of the decision, which will be final.
   10.7.5. The following table will be used in determining the appropriate commander to make final
   decisions in grievances and appeals.

Table 10.1. Definition of Commander.
                   INSTALLATION                                     COMMANDER
US Element / Norway, with OLs (operating location) Installation Commander
Other Installations

10.8. Grievance and Appeal Examiners and Hearings. When a hearing has been requested, the com-
mander will appoint an examiner. The grievance or appeal record will be referred to the examiner for use
in connection with the hearing. The employee will be notified in writing concerning the date, time, and
place of the hearing, and a statement to the effect that the employee has a right to representation of his or
her own choosing; responsibility for arranging for such representation, if so desired; and of his or her right
to produce documentary evidence and witnesses. Hearings will be conducted in a similar manner to those
conducted for US employees. Upon completion of a hearing, the examiner will submit his or her report of
findings and recommendations to the commander for final decision. The employee is to be notified, in
58                                                                      USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005


writing, of the final decision not later than 30 calendar days following receipt of the formal grievance or
appeal.

10.9. Representation of an Employee. An employee may be represented, advised, or accompanied at a
hearing by one representative of his or her choice. Whenever possible, the representative should be des-
ignated by the employee in writing at the time he or she presents the written appeal or grievance. Copies
of all documents furnished to the employee are also to be given to his or her representative. If the repre-
sentative is another employee of the USAF, arrangements should be made for that employee to be avail-
able unless the representation would significantly impair the performance of that person’s regular duties
or would constitute a conflict of interest. Representation by a trade union official does not accord any rec-
ognition to that trade union.

10.10. Use of Official Time.
     10.10.1. An employee in duty status must be given a reasonable amount of official time for the prep-
     aration of his or her presentation to a hearing. If the employee’s representative is a USAF employee
     in duty status, he or she must also be given a reasonable amount of official time to assist or act for the
     employee. The time to be allowed must be determined on the basis of the facts and circumstances in
     each individual case.
     10.10.2. All employees, whether grievants, appellants, representatives, witnesses, or observers, must
     make advance arrangements with their supervisors for the use of official time. When there is a dis-
     agreement, the supervisor is to submit the matter to the CPF for resolution.

10.11. Special Procedures on Grievances or Appeal From an Initial Decision by the Installation
Commander.
     10.11.1. When an employee submits a grievance or appeal brought about directly by the commander,
     the grievance or appeal will be submitted to the commander, through the servicing CPF, for forward-
     ing to the next higher headquarters who will act on the case according to the procedure in paragraph
     10.7. The decision of the next higher headquarters will be final in such cases.
     10.11.2. The special procedures generally apply in small activities, which do not have levels of super-
     vision below the head of the activity, or in instances where the employee is under the direct supervi-
     sion of the commander.

10.12. Involuntary Separation During Trial Period. Employees separated before completion of their
trial period cannot appeal their separation. They have the right to request a review of the action by the
management official at the next higher level of supervision above the official who took or otherwise par-
ticipated in taking or approving the separation action (paragraph 9.7.). Such requests are to be made in
writing, and the findings of the review are to be recorded and copies given to the employee, supervisor,
and the CPF.

10.13. Remedial Action.
     10.13.1. When a decision is favorable to an employee, the specific action to be taken will be estab-
     lished as part of the decision. The action directed will be taken promptly.
USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005                                                                               59


  10.13.2. When the grievance or appeal is based upon a reprimand or adverse personnel action, deci-
  sion in favor of the employee will require such corrective action as follows:
     10.13.2.1. If an official letter of reprimand has been issued, the file copy will be destroyed and the
     employee informed in writing that this has been done.
     10.13.2.2. If the separation of an individual is found unwarranted, restoration may be ordered
     either to his or her former position or one of like seniority, status, and pay. Disciplinary actions of
     lesser severity than originally proposed or taken do not require a new notice period, but are con-
     sidered as corrective action.
     10.13.2.3. An employee whose separation was found to be unjustified will be given retroactive
     compensation, if eligible, for the period of such unjustified separation less any amounts earned
     through other employment during such period.
60                                                                   USAFEI36-752 22 MARCH 2005

                                TRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION

11.1. Call-back Transportation Allowance. An employee who meets the requirements for callback pay
(paragraph 6.5.) will be paid a transportation allowance of NOK75.00 for each period of call-back work.

11.2. Temporary Duty (TDY) Travel. Conditions of TDY and preparation and processing of TDY
travel order requests and claims for reimbursement of travel expenses will be the same as for US citizen
employees.

11.3. Mileage Allowance. The rates for mileage reimbursement will comply with the Norwegian Gov-
ernment Travel Directive, sections 6 and 8. This directive establishes mileage rates for use of privately
owned vehicle when this is more advantageous to the Government. The rate per 1 April 2002 was
NOK3.00 per kilometer (km) for the first 9000 km; after 9000 km the rate is NOK2.40.

11.4. Travel Insurance. Employees required to be on TDY will be reimbursed costs of premiums for
travel insurance. The employee’s supervisor will ensure adequate coverage is obtained by the employee
prior to travel commencing, or the installation commander may, if more cost effective to the government,
ensure adequate coverage by a group TDY travel insurance valid for 1 year. If deemed more cost effec-
tive to the government, the employees will ensure adequate coverage prior to traveling and claim reim-
bursement on a travel voucher. Authorization for the travel insurance coverage will be included on
official travel orders. Adequate coverage will be in accordance with prevailing practices in Norway. It is
the employee’s responsibility to investigate coverage and claims procedures for travel insurance. When
traveling to a European community member country, employees should obtain a Form E111, Health Care
for Visitors to European Economic Area, to obtain emergency medical treatment. This form can be
obtained from the local National Insurance Office (NIO).

12.6. Applicable Laws. Requirements must be carefully observed in connection with all job-incurred
injuries or diseases to assure compliance with the Worker Protection and Working Environment Act of 4
Feb 1977, National Insurance Act, and associated orders and regulations, in order to protect employee
entitlement to benefits arising from the operation of the acts, and to avoid penalties for noncompliance
being imposed on the employer.

12.7. First Aid Treatment. First aid type treatment for all injuries or illnesses occurring on the job is
provided normally through the base medical facilities or by employees using emergency first aid kits
located in workplaces and offices.

12.8. Accident Book. Each employing activity is to maintain one or more accident books, as necessary
to ensure ready accessibility to all employees. This book is to be retained for at least 3 years following the
last entry.(Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, Table 36-26, Rule 22) Details of all notifiable acci-
dents and dangerous occurrences are to be entered. These will include:
   12.8.1. Date and time of the accident or occurrence.

12.9. Notification of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses. In addition to notifying the unit ground
safety office, supervisors are to ensure that all injuries, regardless of how minor they may appear, or cases
of confirmed occupational illness, are recorded in the accident book. Cases of death or major injury are
to be reported immediately, by telephone, to the local labor inspection and the nearest police authority.

12.10. Investigation. All accidents arising during employment (and reported in writing by or on behalf
of the employee) must be investigated by the employing organization, and the facts reported must be ver-
ified or reconciled. If the accident report of the employee cannot be verified on investigation, the circum-
stances so found must be recorded.

12.11. Furnishing Information to the NIO. Employers must furnish, within a reasonable time, any
information that may be requested by the Department about:
   12.11.1. Any accident or alleged incident for which benefit may be payable to, or in respect of the
   death of, an employee.
   12.11.2. The nature and circumstances of employment of any person found claiming to be suffering
   from, or to have died from, an industrial disease.

     dent or injury. All compensation claims will be processed and resolved within the provisions of the
     National Insurance Acts and any in-force insurance. The CPF will assist employees or survivors in
     the preparation and submission of such claims.

12.14. Records. Copies of records connected with reporting, investigating, and treating job-incurred
injuries and illnesses will be maintained in the employee’s personnel folder.

Section 12C—Display Screen Equipment (DSE)

12.15. DSE.
     12.15.1. To secure the health and safety of DSE users, supervisors will ensure the Health and Safety
     DSE Regulations are complied with. DSE users are defined as employees who habitually use DSE as
     a significant part of their normal work.
     12.15.2. The supervisor, at no cost to the employee, will arrange eye and eyesight tests for DSE users.
     Tests are limited to an assessment of the visual capability needed to see the screen and are not a sub-
     stitute for regular and more comprehensive tests.
        12.15.2.1. When tests indicate that glasses are required specifically for work with display screen
        equipment, the supervisor will arrange for the supply of basic glasses or contact lenses at no cost
        to the employee. Employees wishing to purchase glasses or contact lenses of their own choosing
        will be required to meet any additional costs.
        12.15.2.2. Employees will be entitled to undertake an eyesight test at regular intervals. All such
        tests must be arranged through the employee’s supervisor. When there is a change in the user’s
        visual defect, and this results in a change to the prescription requirements, the employing activity
        will bear the cost of replacement.
        12.15.2.3. Safekeeping of the glasses is the personal responsibility of the user. Glasses are sup-
        plied in accordance with a statutory requirement in the interest of health and safety. Employees
        are expected to show the same degree of care for glasses as for any other item of company prop-
        erty. Any user failing to observe this requirement may be subject to disciplinary action.

14.1. Consultation Between Management and Employee Representative. C o n s u l t a t i o n b e t w e e n
management and employee representatives will normally be conducted during regular working hours,
with reasonable time being granted for meetings with other management officials and for the purpose of
drawing up requests or recommendations. Should considerable time be involved in consultation, manage-
ment officials may require that they be conducted on leave or during the non-duty hours of employee rep-
resentatives involved. Union officials who are not themselves employees of USF may participate, by
previous arrangement, in meetings with management representatives.

14.2. Activities Conducted Outside of Work Hours. Those activities concerned with the internal man-
agement of a trade union or employee organization, such as solicitation of membership, membership
meetings, collection of dues, campaigning for office, elections and distribution of literature, will be con-

                                GUIDE TO DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS

A2.1. This guide assists in selecting appropriated penalties. It does not replace supervisory judgment or
dictate penalties. Rather, this guide provides a general framework within which supervisors may exercise
mature judgment in dealing with particular circumstances. Table A2.1. is provided.

A2.2. The column “Cause of Action” does not include every potential cause. There is no “Violation of
Other Rules” cause shown because this item provides no guidance. In using this column, the supervisor
compares the current cause of action to all of those described, and he/she uses those that relate to his/her
situation to assist him in applying the general policy. By relating the nature and seriousness of the current
offense to the fundamental character of those listed, the supervisor fits this offense into the general the
framework. (If there is a directly applicable cause of action shown, it is the one used to guide further con-
sideration.)

A2.3. The “Offense” column establishes the range of penalties within which the penalty to be assessed
usually falls and establish the maximum penalty that can be assessed for an offense of comparable nature.
Because these ranges impose no mandatory minimum penalties, except as required by law, the supervisor
has available to him/her a choice of severity of action ranging from no penalty at all to the maximum
stated in the range. Thus, if the guide shows reprimand as the maximum, the supervisor may determine
that no penalty is needed; or he/she may use either an oral admonishment or a reprimand. A maximum of
removal permits a choice of an admonishment, a reprimand, a removal, or a reduction in rank. The sever-
ity of the penalty depends on the relationship of the current offense to the factors involved, including the
nature of the current offense and the nature and regency of other offenses.

A2.4. Notices of proposed action and of final decision need not contain specific information, other than
that related to cause of action, on how the penalty was selected. In the event of an appeal or grievance,
management must, however, establish that the penalty was appropriate under the circumstances and that
consideration was given to all material factors.

A2.5. Typical Penalty. Unless otherwise restricted, the supervisor has the option of imposing no penalty
or using an oral admonishment.

NOTES:
1. Normally an oral admonishment is used.
2. 31 U.S.C 1349(b) provides that any officer or employee who willfully uses or authorizes
   use of government passenger motor vehicles or aircraft for other than official purposes
   will be suspended for not less than 1month and will be suspended for a longer period or
   removed if circumstances warrant.
3. There is no offense unless (a) the validity of the debt is established, (b) there has been a
   failure to either arrange or comply with a repayment schedule, and (c) there is a current
   complaint from the creditor. Maximum penalty for third and fourth offenses within a
   2-year period is reprimand with the added warning that a “continuation of offenses could
   result in removal.”
4. If a supervisor or manager has engaged in an act of discrimination, an unfair labor prac-
   tice, or an activity, which adversely reflects upon the integrity of the management pro-
   cess, an evaluation will be made of the manner in which the generally discharges his
   management responsibilities to determine whether he should be reassigned or changed to
   lower grade to a position of different character. (Reduction in rank is authorized under
   such conditions but may not be affected in addition to another penalty for the same
   offense.)
5. When a narcotic or dangerous drug has been prescribed for medical purposes under an
   appropriate authority, its use by the patient as prescribed is not an offense in terms of this
   regulation. Close coordination with the base Medical Officer and the Staff Judge Advo-
   cate is required.
6. The penalty is selected with due regard to the employee’s status as a drug experimenter,
   drug user, or drug addict and should, whenever possible, contribute to the employee’s
   rehabilitation and restoration.
7. Due consideration is given to the possibility of rehabilitation and restoring the employee.
