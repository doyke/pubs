                                 PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. Objective. This instruction establishes policies and procedures for the management of
GMVs to include official use of GMVs, OGMVC fleet management, vehicle accident, abuse,
and incident procedures and outlines the vehicle control program. The key to a successful
vehicle management program lies in a clear understanding and acceptance of responsibilities for
vehicle management. Vehicle operators and the operator’s chain of command are charged with
maintaining high standards of vehicle operator training, discipline, and accountability and are
pivotal to the success of the vehicle management program.
1.2. Goal. The goal of this instruction is to enhance vehicle management to include
improvements in accountability, roles and responsibilities, and reductions in GMV accidents,
incidents, and abuses. This instruction provides necessary information to ensure all vehicle
operators are knowledgeable of motor vehicle policies and procedures of operating motor
vehicles in the 354 FW’s area of responsibility. Adherence to these policies and procedures is
the foundation for a solid vehicle management program at the wing, organizational, and flight
levels.
1.3. Scope. This instruction applies to all Squadron Commanders, VCOs, VCNCOs, and
vehicle operators, whether assigned to the 354 FW or another installation, while operating
vehicles or equipment assigned to the 354 FW. This instruction governs all USAF
government-purchased, leased, contracted or rented vehicles and equipment. THE TERM
“GMV” AS USED IN THIS INSTRUCTION REFERS TO ANY VEHICLE,
GOVERNMENT-OWNED, RENTED, OR LEASED PROVIDED BY 354 FW.

       GUIDANCE FOR OFFICIAL USE OF GOVERNMENT MOTOR VEHICLES

2.1. General Information. GMVs are for "official use only.” All personnel must know the
rules and use GMVs in accordance with this instruction and other applicable guidance.
2.2. Procedures to Operate GMVs. Personnel must comply with the following rules to operate
a government owned or leased vehicle:
     2.2.1. Personnel who operate a GMV must possess a valid AF Form 2293, USAF Motor
     Vehicle Operator Identification Card, and a valid United States (U.S.) driver’s license. The
     only exception to this policy is for the operation of a non-tactical 4X2 general purpose
     vehicle with a GVW of 10,000 lbs or less and a passenger capacity of 11 or less; individuals
     who operate these specific vehicles must provide a valid state driver’s license, but are not
     required to have an AF Form 2293. 354 LRS Vehicle Operations can issue an AF Form 2293
     to permanent party and contractor personnel only. The organization’s appointed vehicle
     trainer will issue an AF Form 171, Request for Driver's Training and Addition to U.S.
     Government Driver's License, to supplement an AF Form 2293 for temporary duty personnel
     once they have accomplished the appropriate training with the organization’s appointed
     vehicle trainer IAW AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations.
     2.2.2. Operators will inspect vehicles IAW TO 36-1-191, Table 3-1, and AFI 24-302.
     Drivers will sign the applicable AF Form (AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and
     Trouble Report or AF Form 1807, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report (Fuel
     Servicing Vehicles) or AF Form 4427, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report
     (Fuels Support Equipment)) to annotate inspection results and certify they have completed
     the appropriate inspections. For identified discrepancies and/or required repair actions,
     operators will take vehicles to Vehicle Management, building 3213. Report safety-related
     discrepancies immediately; report all other discrepancies within 24 hours. Failure to comply
     is considered vehicle abuse IAW Chapter 4 of this instruction.
     2.2.3. OGMVC operators will meet additional ORV licensing provisions IAW 354FWI 32-
     7002, Use and Control of Off-Road Vehicles.
     2.2.4. EAFB is located in a moderate corrosion zone. Accordingly, vehicle operators will
     wash their vehicles at least once every 25 days. Operators can call Vehicle Operations at
     377-1843 to receive a list of approved wash racks on the installation.
     2.2.5. Operators of GMVs will not consume or be under the influence of alcoholic beverages
     or medication that may impair physical or mental abilities in performing tasks which require
     alertness within 8 hours of or while operating a GMV. Tobacco use is not permitted in a
     GMV. Eating and drinking is permitted in GMVs at remote job sites where no facilities are
     available, however not permitted while operating a GMV. Once mission is complete, all
     trash will be removed from the GMV upon arriving to a facility.
     2.2.6. GMVs should not be taken on unimproved roads unless used in direct mission
     support.
     2.2.7. GMVs will not be taken to establishments where the primary source of income is

   canoeing, or sightseeing. Do not park at an appropriate establishment and walk to an
   establishment not approved for GMV use; i.e., park at a restaurant and walk to a bar across
   the street.
   2.2.8. Due to the lack of public transportation on Eielson AFB, transportation may be
   provided from lodging or an individual’s workplace to Fairbanks International Airport (FAI)
   IAW AFI 24-301. Operators should contact the Vehicle Operations Control Center (VOCC)
   at 377-1843 or their squadron VCO with any questions on requirements.
   2.2.9. The temporary status of personnel arriving at Eielson AFB does not justify the use of a
   government vehicle. Use of a GMV will always be predicated on need, distances involved,
   availability, and other conditions that justify their use to include large groups or transporting
   weapons. For all non-Red Flag U-Drive-It (UDI) vehicle requests, personnel will submit a
   354 LRS Request for Government Vehicle Support Letter, Attachment 3, to the 354 LRS
   Vehicle Request org box.
2.3. Flight Line, Special Purpose Vehicles, OGMVCs and LSVs. These assets are essential
to the success of our mission. The use of flight line/special purpose vehicles, OGMVCs, and
LSVs for other than direct support of operations is prohibited. Personnel will not use these
vehicles for personal convenience i.e., to/from dining facilities, lodging areas and non-official
use.
2.4. Permissible Operating Distance (POD). Reference 354 LRS Permissible Operating
Distance guidance found in the informational trifold of every GMV. Contact Vehicle Operations
at 377-1843 with any questions regarding the current guidance.
2.5. Operating GMVs During Inclement Weather. During periods of inclement weather,
commanders at all levels must evaluate if mission needs justify the associated operational risks to
personnel and equipment.
   2.5.1. Prior to operating GMVs off base, personnel shall check local travel conditions on the
   Alaska DOT website (http://511.alaska.gov). If road conditions are labeled as “Difficult
   Driving Conditions” or “Red,” personnel will refrain from traveling off base unless
   authorized by their commander.
   2.5.2. IAW AFI 10-229 354 FW Sup I, Responding to Severe Weather Events, unit
   commanders must approve all non-key outdoor activities, including GMV operation, when
   the ambient air temperature drops below -20 F. The 354 MSG/CC is the approval authority
   below -40 F and the 354 FW/CC is the approval authority when temperatures fall below -50
   F.
2.6. Penalties for Misuse of DoD Motor Vehicles and Misuse Investigation. Misuse or
acts/omissions resulting in misuse of GMVs (owned, rented, or leased) may result in disciplinary
action. All military and civilian employees need to take appropriate measures to prevent misuse,
abuse, or willful acts/omissions that could cause damage to GMVs. Directing personnel to
violate official use restrictions is an unlawful order and should be reported to command or other
appropriate agencies. Gross negligence, willful misconduct, or deliberate unauthorized use of a
GMV may result in the following disciplinary actions:
   2.6.1. Military Personnel: Adverse administrative action or punishment under Article 92,
   Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
 8                                                                 354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014


     2.6.2. Civilian Personnel: Civilian discipline will be in accordance with AFI 36-704,
     Discipline and Adverse Actions.
     2.6.3. Report all suspected misuses to LRS Vehicle Operations. Vehicle Operations will
     conduct a technical assessment of the incident to determine if regulatory official use
     guidance has been violated.
        2.6.3.1. Technical assessments will include, at a minimum: the vehicle’s make, model,
        vehicle registration number, the date, time, and location of incident. The offense will be
        clearly stated with official use references substantiating the misuse.
        2.6.3.2. Vehicle Operations will forward all substantiated allegations along with the
        technical assessment to the 354 LRS commander within 7 days of receiving the
        complaint. The LRS commander will forward the substantiated misuse case to the
        operator's unit commander within 7 days of receipt. Unit commanders have 15-calendar
        days to respond to the LRS commander's finding and acknowledge any punitive or
        process-related actions taken to prevent further infractions.
2.7. Safety and Security. Report safety-related discrepancies immediately; report all other
discrepancies within 24 hours. Failure to comply is considered vehicle abuse IAW Chapter 4 of
this instruction.
     2.7.1. Operators and passengers will use lap and shoulder restraints (seat belts) at all times.
     All personnel must adhere to all posted speed limits (GMVs will not exceed 65 MPH) and
     ensure all cargo is properly loaded and secured.
     2.7.2. If involved in an accident while operating a GMV, do not move the vehicle until the
     appropriate authorities have been contacted. Moving a GMV is permitted only if absolutely
     required to prevent another accident or if it compromises safety.
     2.7.3. Contact Security Forces at 377-5130/3133 for on-base accidents and Alaska State
     Troopers at 451-5100, Fairbanks Police at 459-6500, or North Pole Police at 488-6902 for
     off-base accidents.
     2.7.4. Once the appropriate law enforcement authorities have been contacted, contact the
     354 LRS Vehicle Management flight at DSN 377-4229 or Commercial 388-2540 for further
     instructions. Vehicle management personnel will respond to assess damage and determine if
     vehicle is safe to drive.
     2.7.5. Use of hand-held wireless phones and/or text messaging equipment is prohibited while
     operating a GMV. Blue-tooth enabled or hands-free equipment is authorized.
2.8. Authorized uses by TDY personnel. Authorized use of GMVs by TDY personnel differs
from permanent party personnel, in that GMVs may be used to obtain suitable meals on base or
at reputable eating establishments off base, go to drugstores, barber shops, places of worship,
lodging, base exchanges, and all non-appropriated fund activities i.e., golf courses, rod and gun
clubs, bowling alleys. Aircraft towing vehicles, AGE tow vehicles, and special purpose
equipment will not be driven to the shoppette, dining facility, lodging, base exchange,
commissary, etc., in accordance with para. 2.3.
     2.8.1. Personnel on official TDY status are authorized to use a GMV as transportation for
     places where the member’s presence is required for official business, or between such places
     and temporary lodging. GMVs are not authorized in any base housing areas.

2.9. Unauthorized uses by TDY personnel. Use of GMVs for transportation to or from any
other entertainment or recreational facility not mentioned in para. 2.8 is strictly prohibited. This
includes parking at a restaurant and walking to a prohibited establishment.
   2.9.1. Temporary duty personnel will not take step-vans, multi-stops, metros, or bread trucks
   off the installation.
2.10. Permanent Party Personnel Vehicle Use. Official use for active duty personnel includes
transportation to or from Air Force scheduled appointments on or off-base, e.g., MPS records
check, dental appointments, commander’s call, (support must be conducted on base and cannot
be used to circumvent official use rules for purpose of morale), urinalysis, hospital outpatient
appointment. GMV travel is not authorized for elective surgery, procedures, or treatments where
the member would otherwise not be entitled to government travel. However, base military taxis
are the preferred method for fulfilling these requirements. Active duty personnel are authorized
to use GMVs for scheduled medical appointments to Eielson, Fort Wainwright, and Joint Base
Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER). When vehicle transportation is essential to the performance of
official business, the following methods shall be considered in the order shown to the extent they
are available and capable of meeting mission requirements:
   2.10.1. DOD schedule bus service, scheduled public transportation.
   2.10.2. DOD-owned, rented or leased motor vehicle.
   2.10.3. Voluntary use of POV on a reimbursable basis.
   2.10.4. Commercial taxicab on a reimbursable basis.
   2.10.5. Personnel conducting official business in North Pole and Fairbanks are authorized to
   stop and eat at reputable eating establishments within the immediate proximity of the work
   site. This authority is based on efforts to reduce fuel consumption and save man-hours for
   driving time. Specifically, this is to eliminate additional trips to and from the base for the
   sole purpose of obtaining meals. This does not include shopping on the return trip.
   2.10.6. Units may provide transportation to military and civilian personnel officially taking
   part in public ceremonies, parades, and field demonstrations. This is not to be interpreted as
   authority to transport family members or friends invited to attend activities such as
   retirements, promotions, awards ceremonies, funerals, or other similar type functions.
   2.10.7. Family pets can be transported on a space available basis provided there is no
   detriment to the mission. Size of scheduled vehicle will not be increased to accommodate the
   pet. It is the member’s responsibility to ensure the pet is secure (leashed or caged) and any
   damage caused by the pet will be charged to the pet’s owner. Commanders should only
   allow this pursuant to official business; i.e., PCS.
   2.10.8. Child Development Centers (CDC) are authorized limited support to CDC-sponsored
   activities. Support may be provided if drivers and vehicles are available and if it is not
   detrimental to the mission.
   2.10.9. Mental health patients are authorized transportation from the Eielson AFB Clinic to
   Ft Wainwright. Such support must be prearranged and part of patient therapy and ordered by
   a mental health provider. Medical personnel must accompany the patients.

  2.10.10. The installation commander may approve use of GMVs by alert aircrews, ICBM
  personnel, and emergency response forces (groups organized for emergency response
  purposes, e.g., Law Enforcement and Fire Department) for travel to on-base eating
  establishments and base gymnasium when on-duty. This approval may include the use of
  Military Dining Facilities and NAF/AAFES/DECA operated eating establishments to include
  commissary and shoppette. The intent is to afford personnel to remain on duty and maintain
  the ability for immediate response while securing meals for health and sustenance.
  Reference 354 FW Government Motor Vehicle Mission-Specific Authorizations guidance.
  Contact Vehicle Operations at 377-1843 for the most current guidance.
  2.10.11. The 354th Operations Group Commander (354 OG/CC) and acting 354 OG/CC is
  authorized to take his/her vehicle to on-base quarters for performance of their duties in
  connection to on-going flying operations. This should not be interpreted as having command
  and control authority and therefore should not be parked overnight at the quarters. The intent
  is to allow the 354 OG/CC authority to use a GMV to dine at home during flying operations.
  2.10.12. Chapel programs are authorized special program transportation based on vehicle
  availability, driver availability, chapel funding, and if it is not detrimental to higher priority
  missions. However, requests to transport activities such as picnics, special groups, social
  activities, renewal activities, chapel youth trips, or summer camps must be submitted well in
  advance. Overnight trips require chapel personnel to be on official funded orders.
  Otherwise, the trip is considered unofficial and therefore not authorized appropriated
  transportation. Logistics Readiness Squadron vehicle operators used to support these
  programs must be funded by the chapel organization for all overnight trips. All other
  administrative chapel transportation support is provided the same as other organizations.
  2.10.13. Bus transportation in support of DoD-authorized services programs and family
  service center programs may be provided when such support is not detrimental to the Air
  Force mission. The installation commander is the approval authority. However, when
  available, non-appropriated funds (NAF) and commercial sources must be used before Air
  Force assets are used. All requests of this type must be coordinated through the Force
  Support and Logistics Readiness Squadron Commanders. When approved, passenger pickup
  locations must not be from residential areas. Transportation support that requires this
  coordination and approval is listed below:
     2.10.13.1. Command or base varsity teams composed of personnel who officially
     represent the installation in scheduled events.
     2.10.13.2. Military personnel or dependent spectators attending local events in which a
     command or base-sponsored team is participating. Does not include providing personnel
     movement to view or attend an Air Force Band or Tops-in-Blue concert or event.
     2.10.13.3. Visiting entertainers, guests, and their supplies and equipment essential for the
     Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) program.
     2.10.13.4. Base sponsored tours and trips when operated on a non-profit basis.
  2.10.14. Unauthorized uses of GMVs for permanent party personnel are the same as TDY
  personnel with the following additions:
354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014                                                                      11


     2.10.14.1. All transportation of dependents is the sole responsibility of the military
     sponsor. Family members can ride on a space available basis, however, size of vehicle
     will not be increased to accommodate family members.
     2.10.14.2. Personnel on house hunting status will not be provided base level
     transportation support. Housing office can, if circumstances dictate, transport personnel
     using organizational vehicles. If regularly scheduled transportation is available,
     personnel on house hunting status may use those services on a space available basis.
     2.10.14.3. Exclusive assignment of GMV (owned, rented, or leased) to one official or
     employee based on grade, prestige, or personal convenience is unauthorized.
     2.10.14.4. Transportation to an on-base dining facility is a personal responsibility.
     2.10.14.5. As a general rule, do not provide support to spouses at additional expense to
     the government when accompanying the member on official business. The spouse may
     travel with the member at added expense only when there is an unquestionable official
     requirement for the spouse to actually participate in the function. Spectators at functions
     are non-participants. Space available travel is authorized as long as it does not add travel
     distance and the size of the vehicle does not increase.
     2.10.14.6. Do not use GMVs for personal or household moves. The Traffic Management
     Office authorizes appropriate moving entitlements. Only under emergency conditions
     can GMVs be used to support moves. Installation commanders may waive this personal
     property shipment entitlement for emergency or unusual circumstances. Personnel
     requesting transportation support for household good moves should refer to TMO for
     guidance.
     2.10.14.7. Unless conducting official duties or on TDY status, do not use or park GMVs
     at commissaries, base exchange, bowling center, officer or enlisted club, gymnasium, or
     any NAF activity.
     2.10.14.8. Use of GMVs for transportation to any entertainment or recreational facility is
     prohibited for all permanent party personnel unless attending official functions, i.e.
     commander’s call, wing promotion recognition ceremonies, etc.
 12                                                                354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014

      separate OLVIMS site code, request/assign X-registration number, load PMI schedule
      into OLVIMS or establish Vehicle Historical Record for OGMVCs when Vehicle
      Management DOES NOT provide maintenance support.
   3.7.4. Notify the owning organization of pending maintenance actions due.
      3.7.4.1. Overdue preventive maintenance inspections will be reported the same as for
      registered vehicles. An overdue inspection is grounds for a vehicle abuse case IAW
      Chapter 4 of this instruction.
   3.7.5. Refer OGMVC purchase requests to the VFM who will only approve new
   authorizations if the requests meet the criteria in this instruction and other applicable
   publications.
   3.7.6. Reconcile the vehicle master list annually with organizations to ensure OGMVC
   assets are added or removed from separate OLVIMS site as required.
3.8. Organizational Commanders. Commanders will appoint a primary and alternate
VCO/VCNCO IAW Chapter 5 of this instruction.
3.9. Vehicle Control Officers/Noncommissioned Officers (VCOs/VCNCOs). The
VCO/VCNCO will be the focal point for all matters concerning new requests, fuel keys,
transfers, asset accountability, and salvage of OGMVCs. VCO/VCNCOs will ensure the
following:
   3.9.1. Operators receive familiarization training in accordance with 354 FWI 91-202,

   those for general purpose vehicles using an AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and
   Trouble Report.
   3.9.4. Personnel will not operate OGMVCs with an overdue PMI or an annual safety
   inspection.
   3.9.5. Upon receipt of an OGMVC, provide copies of vehicle cost data, receipts,
   specifications, technical data, and warranty paperwork to the 354 LRS Vehicle Management
   Flight. 354 LRS cannot request an “X” registration number without this data.
 14                                                              354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014


   3.9.6. Ensure that assets operated on public roadways and/or off-installation, are in
   compliance with one of the following:
       3.9.6.1. Registered and plated IAW state and/or local law.
       3.9.6.2. Registered in Federal Motor Vehicle Registration System.
           3.9.6.2.1. For OGMVCs not maintained by Vehicle Management, the owning
           organization must request a “Z” registration number from VEMSO through VM&A.
           Once the “Z” registration number is acquired, the owning organization will then
           register the asset in FMVRS.
   3.9.7. Ensure all OGMVCs are accounted for on the proper organizational CA/CRL (R-14).
   3.9.8. Supply 354 LRS with disposition documentation to remove assets from CA/CRLs and
   the separate OLVIMS site as required.
3.10. OGMVC Fleet Standardization. Organizations shall make reasonable effort to
standardize the 354 FW OGMVC fleet. Standardization will streamline operator training and
facilitate cross utilization of parts as assets reach the end of their service life. Using
organizations shall agree upon a single set of specifications for ATVs, UTVs, and snow
machines, which will be used to procure these assets through the appropriate contracting policies
and procedures. The 354 MSG/CC shall be the approval authority for OGMVC requests that are
outside of the standardized specifications. Refer to Attachment 15 for suggested OGMVC
specifications.
3.11. OGMVC Procurement. All requests for approval of an authorization for procurement of
an OGMVC must be approved by the requesting unit and group commander and accompanied by
documented coordination between 354 LRS Vehicle Management Flight, 354 FW/SE, 354
CONS, and the 354 LRS EAE. Refer to Attachment 5 for an example of the coordination
document. 354 CONS will not process any OGMVC purchase requests without this
documentation.
   3.11.1. Organizations must have a valid open authorization for an OGMVC prior to
   initiating procurement action. The requesting organization’s equipment custodian works
   with the 354 LRS EAE to check or establish authorizations. Authorizations are submitted via
   an AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request, and final approval is granted by the Command
   Equipment Management Office. Refer to Attachment 16 for the OGMVC AF Form 601
   process.
   3.11.2. Organizations possessing OGMVCs must maintain documentation showing
   coordination between the base agencies mentioned in para. 3.11 for the life of the asset and
   provide Vehicle Management a copy of the final signed document for inclusion into the
   asset’s historical folder.
3.12. OGMVC Fleet Accountability. Commanders will ensure organizations account for
OGMVCs on their organization’s CA/CRL. If the organization is not structured as a squadron,
the account will be managed at the next level of command (i.e., directorate, group, etc.).
3.13. OGMVC Maintenance. The feasibility of establishing a base wide contract for OGMVC
maintenance was evaluated and determined to be cost prohibitive and too labor intensive to
manage. 354 LRS can be used as an authorized repair facility to service and inspect (to include
annual safety inspections) OGMVCs approved for maintenance support by the VFM/VMS.
354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014                                                                      15


Owning organizations that have OGMVCs located at geographically separated locations are still
responsible for the maintenance of those assets if they are unable to transport them to EAFB.
354 LRS personnel may be available to travel to remote locations to perform OGMVC
maintenance if the owning unit funds all transportation and per diem costs for the member’s
travel.
   3.13.1. Funding. Owning organizations are responsible to fund all aspects of this program,
   excluding labor, and shall plan and forecast accordingly. Units will purchase needed parts
   and consumables, preferably through the use of a Government Purchase Card (GPC). When
   an OGMVC is turned in for maintenance, Vehicle Management will consolidate a list of
   needed parts for each asset requiring repair and furnish the list to the VCO/VCNCO who in
   turn will be responsible to use their unit’s internal processes to procure the items. When all
   of the parts are procured, the VCO will bring the items to Vehicle Management at which time
   repairs will be made. At no time shall 354 LRS expend O&M funds to maintain any units’
   OGMVCs except their own.
   3.13.2. Technical Data. Owning organizations will be responsible to furnish applicable
   technical data to enable 354 LRS to maintain their OGMVCs. The majority of OGMVC
   manufacturers offer limited online support, such as basic part breakdowns for their
   equipment. 354 LRS will use these resources to the fullest extent prior to requesting a unit
   purchase repair and/or part manuals. All technical data requests will be validated by the
   VFM or Vehicle Management Super (VMS). Any manuals purchased for this purpose will
   become part of the Vehicle Management Flight’s commercial manual library and will be
   made available to owning organizations on an as needed basis.
   3.13.3. Prioritization. Organizations must take into account that repair of these assets will
   not take priority over registered vehicle maintenance. 354 LRS will dedicate military
   manning when available to perform OGMVC maintenance; however, mission needs shall
   take precedence as determined by the VFM. OGMVC MC rates will not be factored into the
   base fleet MC rates, nor will any OGMVC data be reported to MAJCOM or LIMS-EV.
   3.13.4. Work Order Processing. OGMVC data will be maintained in a separate OLVIMS
   site code. An OLVIMS generated work order will be used as the source document to track
   both scheduled and unscheduled OGMVC maintenance. Normal work order processing
   actions will be completed IAW AFCSM 24-1, OLVIMS: End User Manual, and AFI 24-302.
   3.13.5. Uneconomical Repairs. The OLVIMS calculated One Time Repair Limit (OTRL)
   will be used as the baseline to determine if an OGMVC is uneconomical to repair.
   Registered vehicle OTRLs are typically calculated from standard replacement costs and life
   expectancies. Since OGMVCs are considered organizational equipment, and do not have
   assigned standard replacement costs or life expectancies, units shall supply 354 LRS with the
   original procurement cost (if known). The original procurement cost will be entered into
   OLVIMS in place of a standard replacement cost. OGMVC life expectancies will be set at
   10 years. This data will be used to calculate the OTRL. In the event units are unable to
   provide the original procurement costs, the manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) will
   be used. MSRPs are available on a variety of internet sites. If required repairs are projected
   to exceed the OTRL an AFTO Form 91, Limited Technical Inspection, will be prepared and
   validated by the VFM/VMS and forwarded to the VCO/VCNCO. The VCO/VCNCO shall
   coordinate the AFTO Form 91 to the unit equipment custodian who will follow proper
16                                                              354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014


  protocol to make the repair decision and/or salvage IAW AFMAN 23-122, Materiel
  Management Procedures.
  3.13.6. Mobile Maintenance Support. OGMVCs are lightweight and easy to transport.
  Several units have trailers specifically designed to transport these assets. Therefore, 354
  LRS will not provide mobile maintenance or wrecker support for these assets. If an OGMVC
  is inoperable, it is the owning organization’s responsibility to transport the asset to Vehicle
  Management for repair.
354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014                                                                     17


                                          Chapter 4

                    VEHICLE ACCIDENTS, INCIDENTS, AND ABUSES

4.1. Goal. To reduce mishaps and avert personal injury or death to Air Force personnel and
reduce the wing cost of vehicle accident and abuse repairs.
4.2. Objective. To establish an effective mishap prevention program by placing responsibility
and accountability on the operator's commander to maintain high standards of vehicle operator
training and discipline and the use of operational risk management in all aspects of vehicle
operations. Consequently, procedures set forth in para. 6 of this instruction will require unit
funding for the actual cost of materials and labor (labor: if repaired using contracted
maintenance) used to repair accident and abuse damage of assigned assets. This policy will
foster increased levels of operator care to safeguard the overall condition of Eielson’s vehicle
fleet.
4.3. Definitions.
   4.3.1. Accident: A vehicle accident is the result of a collision with any foreign object, to
   include stationary objects.
   4.3.2. Abuse: Vehicle abuse is damage caused by willful or negligent acts of improper
   operation or care. Some examples of vehicle abuse are listed in Attachment 2.
   4.3.3. Incident: Damage caused by acts of nature, natural disasters, mechanical failures, or
   other phenomenon that in no way could have been avoided by safe operation or adequate
   vehicle care during non-use. Causes of incidents may also include damage resulting from
   normal use for the vehicle intended purpose (for example, snow removal or heavy
   construction work). Using organizations are not required to reimburse for damage caused by
   incidents.
   4.3.4. Fair wear and tear: The normal expected deterioration of a vehicle or equipment
   based on its age, usage and life expectancy. Using organizations are not required to
   reimburse for damage attributed to fair wear and tear.
4.4. 354 LRS Vehicle Fleet Manager (VFM). The 354 LRS VFM and/or VMS or designated
representative (MSgt or above) will:
   4.4.1. Identify suspected accident or abuse cases. Evaluate and validate each alleged vehicle
   or vehicles on a case-by-case basis.
   4.4.2. Consider the facts and determine whether the vehicle should be processed as an
   accident or suspected abuse due to damages not attributed to fair wear and tear or natural
   incident. NOTE: Unreported damage will be treated as vehicle abuse.
4.5. 354 LRS Vehicle Management & Analysis (VM&A). The 354 LRS VM&A section will:
   4.5.1. Document, track, and gather data on vehicle accidents and abuse.
   4.5.2. Coordinate the vehicle abuse or accident package NLT one duty day from the time the
   vehicle is turned in to the Vehicle Management Flight.
   4.5.3. When requested by the using organization’s commander, VM&A will prepare an AF
   Form 20, Repair Cost and Reparable Value Statement. NOTE: Both military and civilian
 18                                                              354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014


   direct labor charges computed by OLVIMS are used for determining labor cost
   reimbursement for in-house repairs of vehicles/equipment on the AF Form 20.
4.6. 354 LRS/CC. The 354 LRS/CC will:
   4.6.1. Provide an accident or abuse notification memorandum (Attachment 6 or 7), and
   photos to the using organization’s squadron commander. This responsibility may be
   delegated in writing by the 354 LRS/CC.
   4.6.2. Withhold UDI replacements or recalled assets for organizations to replace vehicles
   involved in accident or abuse cases. NOTE: The only exception to this is when the lack of
   vehicles assigned to an organization impacts sortie generation or sustainment.
4.7. Organizational Commanders. The using organization’s commander will:
   4.7.1. When deemed appropriate, appoint an investigating officer to conduct a preliminary
   investigation IAW AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property.
   4.7.2. Ensure the investigation is completed and processed IAW AFMAN 23-220.
   4.7.3. Release vehicle for repair to 354 LRS Vehicle Management Flight and ensure funds
   are available to pay for unit’s accident and abuse repairs. An example of a vehicle release
   letter is located in Attachment 8.
   4.7.4. If an organizational commander believes the government owned vehicle or equipment
   accident/abuse case is not justified, written justification must be forwarded to the 354
   LRS/CC. If the 354 LRS/CC concurs, the accident/abuse case will be dropped. If the 354
   LRS/CC does not concur, the 354 MSG/CC becomes the arbitrary authority.
   4.7.5. Ensure personnel complete a PACAF Form 161, Notification of Mishap, and Eielson
   GMV Mishap Worksheet, Attachment 9, and coordinate forms to their unit safety
   representative within 24 hours of incident.
4.8. Using Organizations. Using organization will:
   4.8.1. Ensure a SF 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report, is accomplished at the time of an
   alleged accident. The vehicle operator shall complete the SF 91 and provide the original to
   the using organization’s VCO/VCNCO. The VCO/VCNCO shall ensure that a copy of the
   SF 91 is turned in to Vehicle Management at the same time the vehicle is turned in to
   Customer Service.
   4.8.2. Notify the Vehicle Management Flight when an accident occurs.                Vehicle
   Management can be contacted during duty hours at DSN 377-4229. After hours, Vehicle
   Management standby personnel can be contacted at commercial 388-2540. Contact numbers
   are also printed on each GMV keychain. Vehicle management personnel will respond to
   determine safety, serviceability, and drivability of the vehicle and advise unit on
   transportation method. If vehicle is not drivable, Vehicle Management personnel will contact
   Vehicle Operations to coordinate transport.
   4.8.3. Ensure their unit personnel are on-scene until the vehicle is transported to the Vehicle
   Management Flight.
354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014                                                                         19


   4.8.4. Report UDI vehicle damage to the 354 LRS Vehicle Operations Control Center
   (VOCC) (DSN 377-1843) within 24 hours and turn the vehicle in to the Vehicle Management
   Flight for repairs.
   4.8.5. Coordinate reimbursement to the 354 LRS for all vehicle parts and/or contract repair
   costs of damaged vehicles due to an accident or vehicle abuse. Turn vehicles in to Vehicle
   Management immediately upon release from the accident scene. NOTE: The initial
   responsibility to identify and report accidents rests with the vehicle operator and the vehicle’s
   assigned unit.
4.9. VCO/VCNCO. The unit’s VCO/VCNCO will:
   4.9.1. Maintain a record of unit’s accident and abuse cases. IAW Air Force Records
   Disposition Schedule, Table 24-03, Rule 13, organizations will maintain a file containing the
   following information for each vehicle accident for a period of 6 years:
      4.9.1.1. Copies of SF 91s, Motor Vehicle Accident Report.
      4.9.1.2. Copy of law enforcement agency accident reports.
      4.9.1.3. Copy of operator’s US driver’s license.
   4.9.2. Send a copy of the PACAF Form 161 and GMV Mishap Worksheet (Attachment 9)
   to 354 FW/SE within 5 duty days of incident.
   4.9.3. Communicate with VM&A regarding status of unit’s funding of accident/abuse
   repairs.
4.10. Units TDY to EAFB. Units TDY to EAFB driving vehicles managed by the 354 FW
will:
   4.10.1. Provide an AF Form 406, Miscellaneous Obligation/Reimbursement Document
   (MORD), with unit’s accounting classification to the 354 LRS Resource Advisor (RA)
   obligating $5,000 or other amount directed by 354 LRS/CC to cover possible accident/abuse
   repairs.
   4.10.2. The 354 LRS RA will hold the AF Form 406 until after the exercise or mission
   terminates and final vehicle assessments are made. When accident or abuse repairs are
   deemed necessary, funding to cover those repairs will be subtracted from the responsible
   unit’s MORD. When repairs are complete, VM&A will notify the RA who in turn will return
   the AF Form 406 to the home station unit.
4.11. Personnel TDY to EAFB. Personnel TDY to EAFB driving vehicles managed by the
354 FW will adhere to the following:
   4.11.1. If personnel utilize UDI/recalled vehicles for more than 72 hours, the TDY unit will
   provide a VIL key letter to ensure that all fuel charges are billed to the TDY unit (see
   Attachment 4).
   4.11.2. 354 LRS/LGRDDO will only issue UDI/recalled vehicles if a copy of the signed VIL
   key letter is provided. VOCC will call Fuels Service Center (FSC) to lock fuel keys once
   GMV is issued; vehicles cannot be refueled until the customer takes the signed VIL key letter
   to 354 LRS/LGRF and have the VIL key recoded with TDY unit’s billing information. **
 20                                                              354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014


   Exceptions to the UDI/recalled vehicle VIL key letter policy will be reviewed on a case-
   by-case basis by the LGRD Flight Commander or Flight Chief. **
   4.11.3. When the UDI fleet cannot meet operational demands, VM&A may initiate a vehicle
   recall. When vehicles are recalled, VM&A will have the FSC deactivate the supporting
   organization’s VIL key. The TDY unit must then complete and submit a VIL key letter to
   354 LRS/LGRF prior to signing for the vehicles.
   4.11.4. TDY units must provide accurate home station unit commander contact information
   to the 354 LRS VOCC and complete a UDI Checkout Sheet.
   4.11.5. TDY units must understand and follow official use and permissible operating
   distance policy letters. Failure to abide by these policies may be grounds for a vehicle
   misuse case.
   4.11.6. If involved in a vehicle accident, follow instructions in para. 4.8.       Provide all
   applicable forms to the VOCC.
   4.11.7. Reimbursement for accident and abuse repairs will be sought from the member’s
   home-station unit of assignment.
4.12. Additional Guidance.
   4.12.1. Accidents involving privately owned vehicles (POV) and GMV: The assigned or
   using organization will provide the 354 FW/JA sufficient information about the accident to
   determine if the POV or GOV driver was at fault. If the POV driver was at fault, the 354
   FW/JA will pursue repairs through the POV insurance company, with all repairs being
   accomplished through contractors to facilitate reimbursement of costs.
   4.12.2. Multiple-Unit Accidents: Each unit will conduct an investigation. The commanders
   of the units involved will jointly determine liability. If a decision cannot be made, the 354
   MSG/CC will have final decision authority.
4.13. Procedures. Upon determination that vehicle damage is a result of an accident or abuse:
   4.13.1. A letter identifying the details of the accident or abuse damage, photos, and a release
   letter will be sent by the 354 LRS/CC or delegated appointee to the responsible
   organization's commander (see Attachments 6 & 7).
   4.13.2. When organizational commanders release government-owned/leased vehicles for
   accident/abuse repairs, the using organizational commander accepts financial liability and
   will allocate funds for vehicle repairs.
   4.13.3. For all government-owned and dry-leased General Services Administration (GSA)
   vehicle accident and abuse repairs above the GPC micro-purchase threshold for services, the
   process will be completed using an AF Form 9, Request for Purchase. Vehicle Management
   will complete a Performance Work Statement (PWS) and an Interdependent Government
   Estimate (IGE) for every accident or abuse case, except for those cases repaired in-house.
   The completed PWS, IGE and photos, compiled to make up the repair estimate package, are
   sent to the        354 LRS/RA to be forwarded to the responsible using organization’s RA.
   The responsible using organization’s RA processes an AF Form 9 in the Automated Business
   Services System, then forwards the repair estimate package to 354 CONS. Utilizing the
   repair estimate package, 354 CONS will solicit vendors to bid for the contract repair. Once
354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014                                                                  21


  the contract has been awarded, CONS will notify Vehicle Management to deliver the vehicle
  to the vendor for repair. The RA will inform the unit VCO/VCNCO of the status of each
  Form 9, who in turn will contact VM&A to provide status updates and assistance to resolve
  any difficulties in the process. NOTE: This procedure does not apply to GSA vehicles on a
  wet lease. Please contact VM&A at 377-4745 to determine if your vehicles are on a dry
  lease or wet lease.
  4.13.4. For all government-owned and dry-leased General Services Administration (GSA)
  vehicle accident and abuse repairs below the GPC micro-purchase threshold for services, the
  process will be completed as determined by the VFM/VMS.
  4.13.5. For in-house accident and abuse repairs performed by the 354 LRS Vehicle
  Management Flight, the preferred method of parts procurement is for the owning unit to
  purchase the required parts with their GPC. In the event the unit is not able to make a GPC
  purchase, 354 LRS will procure the parts and VM&A will send the refundable/reimbursable
  file (also known as the V12) to 354 CPTS for validation and coordination of reimbursement
  from the using organization.

                                           Chapter 5

                             VEHICLE CONTROL PROGRAM

5.1. Vehicle Control Program (VCP). DoD policy requires GMV resources to be organized
and managed to ensure optimum responsiveness, efficiency, and economy in support of the DoD
mission. To ensure day-to-day management of organizationally assigned GMVs, the Air Force
has adopted the VCP. All base activities operating 354 FW supplied GMVs will have an active
VCP.
5.2. 354 LRS Vehicle Control Function (VCF). The VCF is responsible to implement a
positive VCP, enforce policy to decrease instances of accidents, abuse, and incidental damage to
GMVs. Additionally, the VCF will:
   5.2.1. Manage the VCP IAW AFI 24-302 and this instruction.
   5.2.2. Perform annual staff assistance visits.
   5.2.3. Perform annual wing vehicle assessment inspections.
   5.2.4. Report the results of the vehicle assessment inspections to the using organization’s
   commander and compile an annual report for submission to the 354 MSG/CC.
   5.2.5. Provide training to appointed VCO/VCNCOs.
   5.2.6. Conduct semiannual VCO meetings.
5.3. Organizational Commanders.
   5.3.1. Appoint a primary and alternate VCO/VCNCO in writing to act as liaisons between
   their organization and 354 LRS on all matters related to vehicles. A sample appointment
   letter is contained in Attachment 10.
   5.3.2. Support appointed VCO/VCNCOs and their squadron’s VCP.
   5.3.3. Ensure assigned personnel understand and adhere to applicable instructions.
5.4. Organizational VCO/VCNCOs.
   5.4.1. Manage organization’s VCP IAW AFI 24-302 and this instruction.
   5.4.2. Ensure personnel are informed on vehicle management issues.
   5.4.3. Defend vehicle requirements, justify requests for additional vehicle authorizations,
   comply with the base vehicle rotation and priority recall plans, and notify Vehicle
   Management when assigned vehicles are no longer required. See Attachment 13 for the AF
   Form 601 process.
   5.4.4. Ensure only qualified and properly licensed military, DoD employees, or authorized
   DoD Contractors who meet the criteria established in AFI 24-301 operate assigned GMVs.
   5.4.5. Ensure low-utilization or low-mileage vehicles are rotated with high-usage or high-
   mileage vehicles within the organization’s span of control.
   5.4.6. Ensure all vehicles are washed IAW para 2.2.4.
354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014                                                                      23


  5.4.7. Ensure each vehicle is equipped with the appropriate AF Form (AF Form 1800,
  Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report or AF Form 1807, Operator’s Inspection
  Guide and Trouble Report (Fuel Servicing Vehicles) or AF Form 4427, Operator’s
  Inspection Guide and Trouble Report (Fuels Support Equipment)), Basic Issue Items (BII),
  applicable accident checklists and forms. See Attachment 12 for a complete listing of
  required documentation.
  5.4.8. Maintain accountability of all BII. BII are items originally issued with each vehicle.
  Examples of BII include: spare tires, jacks, lug wrenches, first aid kits and safety/road kits.
  Using organizations are responsible to provide replacement BII for lost/missing items. 354
  LRS will only provide replacement items if items are found to be unserviceable.
  Replacement BII will only be replaced on a “one for one” exchange. BII accountability is
  extremely important to the leased vehicle fleet as missing items could incur additional
  expenses to the government at turn-in.
  5.4.9. Ensure all GMVs assigned to their organization are turned in for scheduled
  maintenance prior to date or mileage due.
  5.4.10. Ensure all organizational short-term vehicle leasing actions are coordinated through
  Vehicle Management.
  5.4.11. Transfer accountability of organization’s fleet from the losing to gaining
  VCO/VCNCO prior to the losing VCO/VCNCO’s projected departure. In the event a
  VCO/VCNCO’s replacement is not on the ground in sufficient time to facilitate the proper
  turnover, the organizational commander should appoint an interim VCO/VCNCO.
  5.4.12. Out-process the 354 LRS Vehicle Management Flight after the using organization’s
  fleet accountability has been transferred to the new VCO/VCNCO.
  5.4.13. Attend semiannual VCO/VCNCO meetings hosted by 354 LRS.
  5.4.14. Ensure all GMV markings are consistent with Air Force Technical Order (TO) 36-1-
  191. Organizations may not affix markings or stickers to the interior or exterior of a vehicle
  without first receiving approval from the VFM. Special activity markings and radio call
  signs may be used on certain vehicles which have not been otherwise specified in TO 36-1-
  191 when such markings are deemed mission essential, in writing, by the installation
  commander. VCO/VCNCOs must submit a vehicle add-on letter to request approval of
  additional markings. Organizations requesting additional authorized markings will procure
  required items and coordinate with Vehicle Management for installation. Operational
  markings required on leased assets must be negotiated between Vehicle Management and
  GSA and may increase vehicle lease cost.
  5.4.15. Ensure that vehicle add-on/modifications are not performed until add-
  on/modifications are formally approved by Vehicle Management. See Attachment 11 for an
  example.
     5.4.15.1. Submit all add-on/modification letters to Vehicle Management and Analysis
     (VM&A).
     5.4.15.2. Vehicle Management will make suggestions and or approve/disapprove the
     request. Once approved, a copy of the request will be filed in the permanent section of
     the vehicle historical record. The original will be returned to the VCO/VCNCO.
 24                                                              354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014


       Organizations shall retain a copy of all approved add-on/modification letters as long as
       the asset is assigned.
       5.4.15.3. Leased/GSA vehicle modifications will normally not be approved due to costs
       incurred at turn-in. Vehicle Management must have written approval from the lease
       vendor or GSA prior to approving any modification to a leased asset.
       5.4.15.4. Unauthorized modifications may result in a vehicle abuse case against the using
       organization and in some cases restrict nuclear certified equipment from its intended use.
   5.4.16. Report mileage/hours NLT the 7th day of each calendar month to the VM&A group
   mailbox. The e-mail address is: 354lrs.vma@us.af.mil.
   5.4.17. Make reasonable efforts to use assigned GMVs prior to requesting U-Drive It
   support.
   5.4.18. Maintain the required documentation in each vehicle IAW Attachment 11.
   5.4.19. Maintain a VCO/VCNCO Continuity Book with the minimum contents listed in
   Attachment 14.
   5.4.20. Conduct a monthly vehicle safety briefing for organizational personnel and
   document subjects and individuals briefed. Retain briefing records for one calendar year.
5.5. Vehicle Control Function Assistance Visits. VCF will conduct annual assistance visits.
Out of cycle assistance visits may be conducted, upon request, to evaluate an organization’s
vehicle control program. Issues such as operational problems, binder contents, vehicle rotation,
utilization, requirements, security, operator training and licensing, lesson plans, misuse, and
OGMVC fleet management may be addressed. Results will be documented to include the topics
discussed, noted discrepancies, noteworthy observations, and improvement suggestions. A copy
of the report shall be provided to the organizational commander and VCO/VCNCO.
5.6. Vehicle Assessment Inspections. The VCF will conduct a no-notice inspection of at least
25 percent of the installation GMV fleet during each calendar year. The intent of the inspection
is to ensure proper operator care is being performed and vehicle documentation is being properly
completed. Inspections will emphasize safety items, unreported damage, and operator care.

                                            Chapter 6

                                    EXERCISE SUPPORT

6.1. Vehicle Support. The purpose of this chapter is to formalize procedures used to support
exercise participants with GMVs. EAFB hosts several exercises a year and each exercise
presents unique logistical challenges for the 354 LRS to overcome to provide world-class
customer service and vehicle support. Exercise planners and participants must remember that the
354 LRS has access to a finite pool of vehicle resources. Local area vendors have the ability to
augment vehicle support; however, the vehicle pool is small and the majority of exercises
coincide with the summer tourist season. Therefore, exercise planners and participants should
not automatically assume that vehicle support can be supported through pre-existing programs
with local rental agencies.
6.2. PACAF A3/YT. Provide 353 CTS/ES with all known vehicle requirements (to include
rental vehicle requirements) after each planning conference. If rental vehicle support is required,
and once estimates are provided, submit a Fund Cite Authorization (FCA) letter to the VFM to
cover the estimated costs of rentals, fuel, and anticipated damage.
6.3. 353 CTS Exercise Support (CTS/ES). The 353 CTS/ES will act as the focal point for all
vehicle related manners i.e., vehicle requests, vehicle accident/abuse issues, misuse routing, etc.
Direct exercise support is defined as support for PACAF affiliated/funded exercise participants.
6.4. 354 LRS/LGRDDO. 354 LRS/LGRDDO will support 353 CTS, as needed, with available
assigned vehicle assets.
6.5. 354 LRS/LGRV. 354 LRS/LGRV will initiate actions to procure GSA short-term rentals.
Additionally, they will manage vehicle recall efforts and provide assets to Vehicle Operations to
support exercise participants.
6.6. 354 LRS/CC. 354 LRS/CC will act as the approval authority for short-term rental vehicles.
Short-term is defined as 60 days or less.
6.7. 354 LRS/RA. The 354 LRS/RA will use the FCA to process a MORD for reimbursement
of all rental vehicles and related expenses.
6.8. Exercise Participants. Exercise participants shall care for vehicular assets provided to
them IAW this instruction and other applicable instructions and policies. Additionally,
participant’s home station unit shall provide a MORD for not less than $5,000 to the
354 LRS/RA. The purpose of this MORD is to cover the costs of vehicle accidents or abuse
damage (see para. 4.10.1).
6.9. U-Drive-It (UDI) Support. Due to budgetary constraints, UDIs shall be considered first to
support exercise participants. The following process will be used to determine if the UDI fleet
can support exercise participants:
   6.9.1. 353 CTS/ES will provide 354 LRS/LGRDDO a consolidated listing of all vehicle
   requirements they cannot meet with their assigned resources.
   6.9.2. 354 LRS/LGRDDO will use OLVIMS Dispatch Module to forecast if the UDI fleet
   can support requirements. If the UDI fleet cannot support all requirements, Vehicle
 26                                                              354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014


   Operations personnel will compile a listing of vehicle assets they cannot support; this listing
   will be known as the shortfall list.
       6.9.2.1. If the UDI fleet can support some or all of the requirements, 354 LRS/LGRDDO
       will provide a consolidated listing of confirmation numbers to 353 CTS/ES. These assets
       will be dispatched from Vehicle Operations on dates requested directly to 353 CTS.
          6.9.2.1.1. 354 LRS/LGRDDO (Vehicle Operations Control Center) will coordinate
          with Fuels Service Center (FSC) to deactivate VIL key when GMV is issued. TDY
          personnel will produce a signed VIL key letter to 354 LRS/LGRF directly after pick
          up of any UDI/recalled vehicle asset to ensure that all fuel charges are billed to the
          TDY units billing information (see Attachment 4).
          6.9.2.1.2. When the UDI fleet cannot meet operational demands, VM&A may initiate
          a vehicle recall. When vehicles are recalled, VM&A will have the FSC deactivate the
          supporting organization’s VIL key. The TDY unit then must complete and submit a
          VIL key request letter to 354 LRS/LGRF prior to signing for the vehicles.
       6.9.2.2. For requirements above and beyond what the UDI fleet can support, 354
       LRS/LGRDDO will forward the short-fall list to 353 CTS/ES and VM&A. VM&A will
       determine if the requirements can be met by recalling assets from other base
       organizations.
6.10. Vehicle Recall Support. Vehicle recall support should be considered prior to committing
to GSA short-term rentals. The following procedure will be used to determine if the remaining
requirements can be met with recalled vehicle support. See Attachment 17 for the vehicle recall
process flowchart.
   6.10.1. VM&A will review the short-fall list and review unit MELs. If units are above
   MELs, and forecasted maintenance requirements do not drop units below their MEL, those
   units’ assets may be considered for recall to support exercise participants. At no time shall a
   units’ vehicle fleet be reduced below their MEL nor will 354 LRS fund rental vehicles to
   backfill a recalled asset.
   6.10.2. Units will turn in recalled assets within 2 hours of being recalled to Vehicle
   Management. Once Vehicle Management processes the recalled vehicle it will be transferred
   to Vehicle Operations and will be issued directly to 353 CTS/ES in the same manner as a
   UDI vehicle.
   6.10.3. Recalled assets, regardless of dispatch duration, will have VIL key data switched to
   bill all fuel charges to the 353 CTS or TDY units prior to exercise participants taking custody
   of the vehicle.
       6.10.3.1. The supported unit is required to physically deliver the VIL key request letter
       (Attachment 4) to the 354 LRS Fuels Control Center. VIL keys will remain locked out
       and units will not be able to refuel recalled assets without completing this process.
   6.10.4. Requirements above and beyond UDI and recalled asset capacity may be filled by
   utilizing the GSA short-term rental program.
6.11. Government Services Agency (GSA) Short-Term Rentals. The GSA short-term rental
program is designed to meet unique mission requirements and/or surge operations for periods of
354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014                                                                       27


60 days or less. Prior to 354 LRS pursuing rental support, the requesting unit (typically PACAF
A3/YT for RF-A exercises) will commit, in writing, to fund the rental vehicles.
   6.11.1. Once VM&A makes the determination that the base fleet cannot support
   requirements they will make their recommendation to the VFM of which assets need to be
   rented. The VFM will submit a short-term rental request for quote (RFQ) to GSA.
   6.11.2. The VFM will submit the RFQ to enable participants to pick up their rental vehicles
   directly from the rental agencies upon their arrival into FAI. This reduces logistical support
   requirements and lessens the burden and costs to transport participants to and from the
   airport.
   6.11.3. GSA then provides the RFQ to local rental agencies who have the opportunity to
   submit bids on the open requirements. The VFM must provide GSA with justification if the
   low quote is not used.
   6.11.4. The VFM confirms the quote and the rental agencies send their confirmation
   numbers back directly to the VFM.
   6.11.5. The VFM will forward the confirmation numbers to 353 CTS/ES. 353 CTS/ES shall
   provide the VFM with the authorized participant’s names, dates, and times of arrival. This
   information is required to be supplied to the rental agency no later than 3 business days prior
   to vehicle pickup. 353 CTS/ES will verify that rental vehicles were picked up by personnel
   on the pre-arranged dates and times.
   6.11.6. In the event participant information is not provided within 3 days of a known
   requirement start date, 353 CTS/ES will be responsible for arranging rental car pick up from
   FAI and assign rental vehicles to participants IAW guidance received from PACAF A3.
   6.11.7. Wright Express fuel cards will be provided to participants once they arrive to EAFB
   and present a copy of the rental agreement to the 353 CTS Vehicle Management Liaison.
   Fuel cards are controlled items and participants must safeguard them against loss and
   pilferage.
   6.11.8. NLT 7 days prior to exercise termination, 353 CTS/ES must provide the VFM with a
   rental vehicle turn-in plan. The purpose of the turn-in plan is to aid verification of charges.
   Vehicles may be turned in early, but may not be extended without prior authorization from
   PACAF A3, GSA, and the rental company. Participants may turn in the vehicles as they
   depart FAI and must ensure that fuel levels are topped off prior to doing so. Vehicles will be
   topped off at EAFB prior to departure for FAI/rental agency. Late rental turn-ins will be
   reported to PACAF A3/YT and the responsible participant may be held liable for additional
   incurred costs and service fees.
6.12. GSA Short-Term Rental Reimbursement. The GSA billing process can take several
months for all charges to show up on the 354 LRS GSA bill. Rental vehicle charges appear as
Non-IPAC (Intra-Government Payment and Collection System) charges and are reimbursed
directly to the 354 LRS through the establishment of a MORD.
   6.12.1. The VFM shall monitor GSA Non-IPAC bills and compare actual charges against the
   estimates provided from the RFQs. If discrepancies are noted, the VFM shall work directly
   with GSA to rectify.
 28                                                                 354FWI24-301 28 MAY 2014


   6.12.2. Within 7 days of receipt of a Non-IPAC bill, the VFM, or appointed designee, will
   validate charges and provide the statement along with a detailed explanation of charges to the
   354 LRS/RA.
   6.12.3. The 354 LRS/RA will work with 354 CPTS to pay Non-IPAC rental vehicle charges.
6.13. Off-Season Vehicle Care. Vehicles permanently assigned to support the RF-A mission
present a set of unique circumstances concerning their management during the off-season. The
off-season is defined as the period between the last exercise in the fall until the next exercise the
following spring. This period encompasses approximately 6 months of the year.
   6.13.1. 354 LRS has coordinated with VEMSO to allow all RF-A vehicle assets to be placed
   in a “Parked” status during this period. However, prior to parking assets for the season the
   following steps will be completed.
       6.13.1.1. 353 CTS personnel will turn assets they wish to park into Vehicle
       Management. Vehicle Management will complete a LTI on each asset to verify
       serviceability and repair, as needed, to meet serviceability standards contained in AFTO
       36-1-191, Technical and Managerial Reference for Motor Vehicle Maintenance.
       Additionally, Vehicle Management will complete any required/projected preventative
       maintenance.
       6.13.1.2. When vehicles are released from Vehicle Management, 353 CTS personnel will
       wash the vehicle’s exterior and park the vehicle in its designated parking location. To be
       considered under this exception, vehicles must be parked in a warm storage location.
   6.13.2. While vehicles are in a parked status the following operator inspections are required.
   Additionally, vehicles in a parked status are exempted from the 25-day washing requirement.
       6.13.2.1. Weekly visual inspections. Operators shall inspect for leaks, flat tires, and
       unreported damage. If discrepancies are noted report them the Vehicle Management.
       6.13.2.2. Monthly operator inspections. General and special purpose vehicles, excluding
       firefighting, MHE, and fuel servicing vehicles, will be inspected at least monthly and the
       inspection documented on the vehicle’s AF Form 1800.
           6.13.2.2.1. Vehicles categorized as MHE or 463L will be inspected weekly. This
           inspection will be documented on the vehicle’s AF Form 1800.
       6.13.2.3. Quarterly run ups. All vehicles placed in a parked status will be operated and
       exercised at least quarterly. Gasoline powered equipment will be ran for a minimum of
       20 minutes. Diesel powered equipment will be ran for a minimum of 30 minutes.
       VCNCOs shall maintain a log of when quarterly inspections are accomplished.

                   VEHICLE JUSTIFICATION/REQUEST PROCESS

A13.1. The VCO/VCNCO: Must continually review/justify existing and new vehicle
requirements and notify VM&A when assigned vehicles are no longer required.
A13.2. The following items must be considered when requesting an additional vehicle(s): New
vehicle requests will be submitted on an AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request, for approval.
Units must understand that the Air Force has adopted a policy of zero vehicle fleet growth.
   A13.2.1. Does the justification cite the directive, project, or publication that generated the
   request, if appropriate?
   A13.2.2. Does the justification fully explain proposed use of the vehicle?
   A13.2.3. Does the justification identify expected utilization information (miles, hours,
   passengers, equipment, supplies, materials, number of trips, etc.)?
   A13.2.4. Does the justification list the numbers of vehicles currently authorized and assigned
   to the requesting organization and justify why co-utilization will not meet mission
   requirements?
   A13.2.5. Does the request justify why transportation support from Vehicle Operations
   cannot satisfy the vehicle requirement?
   A13.2.6. Does the justification include a mission impact statement on the organization,
   wing, or base if the request is denied?
   A13.2.7. Does the justification cite any actions taken to realign other authorizations to
   accommodate the requirement?
A13.3. The AF Form 601 approval process starts at the VCO level and then flows through the
offices in Figure A.13.1. New vehicles and long-term additional requirements are justified on
an AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request. The AF Form 601 is reviewed by the Vehicle Fleet
Manager and recommendation forwarded VEMSO. If approved by VEMSO, the authorization
will be supported with the appropriate vehicle type when it becomes available.
