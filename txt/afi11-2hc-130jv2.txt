                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This volume provides flight examiners and aircrews with procedures and
evaluation criteria/tolerances to be used during both flight and ground phases of initial and
periodic evaluations. All HC-130J evaluations will be conducted according to this volume and
AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, as supplemented. Specific areas
for evaluation are prescribed to ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities
of aircrews. Flight examiners use this document when conducting aircrew evaluations.
Instructors use this document when preparing aircrews for qualification.
1.2. Applicability. This volume is applicable to all individuals performing crew duties on HC-
130J and assigned Back-up Aircraft Inventory (BAI) aircraft.
1.3. Key Words and Definitions.
     1.3.1. Will" and "Shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.
     1.3.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
     accomplishment.
     1.3.3. ―May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
     1.3.4. ―Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
     emphasize.
1.4. Waivers. Waiver authority for this publication is the MAJCOM/A3, IAW AFI 11-202 Vol
2. Waivers will be requested from the parent MAJCOM Stan/Eval through appropriate channels.
Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specified in the supplement and approved
through the higher level coordination authority.
1.5. Procedures.
     1.5.1. Flight examiners will use the criteria contained in this volume for conducting all
     flight, simulator, and emergency procedures evaluations. To ensure standard and objective
     evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation
     criteria.
     1.5.2. Unless specified in AFI 11-2HC-130JV1, Aircrew Training or AFI 11-2HC-130JV3,
     Operations Procedures, the examinee or flight examiner may fly in any seat that will best
     enable the examiner to conduct a thorough evaluation.
     1.5.3. Before the Aircraft Commander Briefing, the evaluator will inform the aircraft
     commander of any special requirements. Flight examiners will brief the examinee on the
     conduct, purpose, and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation
     criteria, prior to flight. The examinee will accomplish all required mission planning. If an
     Operations Planning Team (OPT) or Deployment Planning Team (DPT) accomplishes
     mission planning, the examinee is ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness
     of all mission-planning paperwork. Flight examiners will be furnished a copy of necessary
     charts, flight logs, mission folders, and any additional items they require.
AFI11-2HC-130JV2 21 MARCH 2012                                                                 5


   1.5.4. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
   but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
   1.5.5. Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight. During the
   critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations,
   area/sub area grades assigned, and any additional training required.
   1.5.6. When grading criteria specify that airspeed will be evaluated and the flight manual
   lists only minimum/maximum/recommended airspeed for that area, the examinee will brief
   the desired airspeed, if applicable.
   1.5.7. Under no circumstances will a pilot flight examiner allow the aircraft to slow to below
   one engine inoperative air minimum control speed (Vmca), regardless of airspeed tolerances
   listed for specific areas.
1.6. Grading Instructions.
   1.6.1. The grading system for most areas in this volume is a three-level system (Q/Q-/U).
   Areas identified as "Critical" in Table 2.1 through Table 2.5 have a two-level system (Q/U).
   If the examinee receives a U in any critical area, assign an overall Qualification Level 3 (Q-
   3).
   1.6.2. Required areas are indicated with an "R" in Table 2.1 through Table 2.5 for specific
   evaluations. All required areas must be evaluated. Refer to crewmember specific chapter for
   additional guidance. Flight examiners may evaluate any other areas observed, at their
   discretion. When it is impossible to evaluate a required area in the aircraft due to equipment
   malfunctions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, or weather, that area may be
   evaluated by an alternate method (simulator, procedural trainer, or verbal examination)
   unless otherwise noted. If, in the flight examiner's judgment, a required item cannot be
   adequately evaluated by an alternate method, complete the evaluation on an additional flight.
   If a required item is not accomplished, the evaluator will place a comment in the Additional
   Comments portion of the AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   1.6.3. The flight examiner will compare the examinee's performance for each area with the
   standards provided in this volume and assign an appropriate grade for the area. Derive the
   overall flight evaluation grade from the area grades based on a composite for the observed
   events and tasks IAW AFI 11-202V2 and this volume.
      1.6.3.1. To the maximum extent possible, flight examiners will use the grading criteria in
      this volume to determine individual area grades. Exercise judgment when the wording of
      areas is subjective and when specific areas are not covered.
      1.6.3.2. Flight examiner professional judgment will be the determining factor in arriving
      at the overall grade.
      1.6.3.3. Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable
      aircraft. Do not consider momentary deviations from a tolerance, provided the examinee
      applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety.
      Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.
1.7. Additional Training.
 6                                                        AFI11-2HC-130JV2 21 MARCH 2012


     1.7.1. Flight examiners are responsible for assigning additional training, at their discretion.
     Document additional training IAW AFI 11-202V2. Any approved training device or medium
     may be used for additional training.
     1.7.2. When unique situations (such as crosswind landings) present valuable training
     opportunities, additional training may be accomplished on an evaluation flight. However,
     this option requires flight examiner discretion and judicious application. The examinee must
     be informed when the additional training begins and ends.
1.8. Unsatisfactory Performance.
     1.8.1. Dependent upon the item requiring the recheck, rechecks may be accomplished on the
     ground or in flight at the discretion of the flight examiner. Rechecks should normally be
     administered by a flight examiner other than the one who administered the original
     evaluation.
     1.8.2. If the flight examiner observes an aircrew counterpart jeopardizing safe flight, the
     examiner will assume the duties of that aircrew member (provided the examiner’s flight duty
     period [FDP] does not exceed AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, Table 9.1 maximum
     FDP for an un-augmented crew). This does not mean the examiner must assume the
     examinee's position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed. If the examiner feels
     the examinee can continue safely with supervision, the examiner is not required to assume
     the examinee's duties. However, if the flight examiner assumes the examinee's duties, assign
     a Qualification Level 3 (Q-3) as the overall grade.
     1.8.3. Evaluators will report deviations/discrepancies from established procedures/directives
     in any area, regardless of the individual's crew specialty, to squadron/group commander for
     evaluation and necessary action in accordance with MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-202V2.
1.9. Emergency Procedures Evaluation (EPE). Conduct EPEs for all requisite flight
evaluations. The EPE will include areas commensurate with the examinee's qualification and
experience level.
     1.9.1. Flight examiners may conduct EPEs verbally, in-flight, in a simulator, or by another
     method determined by the examiner or unit Stan/Eval. Flight examiners determine EPE
     content and individual EPE areas. OGVs may develop EPE guides for each crew position
     flight examiner use. All crew positions with BOLDFACE procedures will accurately
     recite/write the applicable BOLDFACE procedures.
        1.9.1.1. EPEs should be scenario driven, and tailored to the specific crew position.
        Emphasize emergency procedures and systems knowledge, related to the situation. For
        mission evaluations, evaluate mission-specific equipment and situations.
        1.9.1.2. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in-flight. The
        examinee will recite all BOLDFACE items from memory and should provide the initial
        steps of emergency procedures that, in the opinion of the examiner, would not allow time
        for reference.
     1.9.2. EPEs will include sufficient in-flight and ground emergencies to evaluate the
     examinee's knowledge of systems and procedures to the flight examiner's satisfaction.
AFI11-2HC-130JV2 21 MARCH 2012                                                                   7


   1.9.3. Tailor mission evaluation scenarios to unit tasking and include areas not normally
   evaluated in flight, such as defensive systems operation (if applicable), threat interpretation,
   and evasive action (mission evaluations only).
   1.9.4. The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs for all
   crew positions Exception: for BOLDFACE use grading criteria in Area 18).
       1.9.4.1. Q-1. Satisfactory systems/procedural knowledge. Operated within prescribed
       limits and correctly diagnosed problems. Performed and/or explained proper corrective
       action, in the proper sequence, for each type of malfunction. Accomplished all required
       checklists and/or effectively used available aids. Thoroughly described the location, use
       and limitations of emergency equipment.
       1.9.4.2. Q-2. Marginal systems/procedural knowledge. Slow to analyze problems or
       apply proper corrective actions. Did not effectively use checklist and/or available aids.
       Minor omissions or deviations in describing the location, use and limitations of
       emergency equipment.
       1.9.4.3. Q-3. Unsatisfactory systems/procedural knowledge. Unable to analyze problem
       or take corrective action. Failed to accomplish required checklists and/or unable to locate
       information in available aids. Major omissions or deviations in describing the location,
       use and limitations of emergency equipment.
1.10. Special Qualifications. Special qualification evaluations are administered for event
qualifications that are not universal to all crew positions in the airframe, to all members in that
crew position, or to all units. Special qualification evaluations may be conducted separately or in
conjunction with the qualification/mission evaluation. After initial qualification, special mission
events will be incorporated into subsequent periodic qualification and/or mission evaluations
IAW Table 2.3 thru Table 2.5 and the applicable crew chapters of this instruction. There are no
requisites for special qualification evaluations.
   1.10.1. Refer to the appropriate crew position chapters of this instruction for any special
   qualifications evaluation requirements.
   1.10.2. Special qualification evaluations will be annotated as a ―SPOT‖ evaluation in a
   separate Flight Phase block of the AF Form 8. Further define the specific evaluation in the
   Mission Description section of the Comments block on the AF Form 8.
1.11. Instructor Certified Events. These are events that require certification of training by an
instructor or flight examiner, not an evaluation as described in paragraph 1.11 Document
certification per MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, AFI 11-202V2.
Refer to AFI 11-2HC-130J, Volume 1, HC-130J Aircrew Training, for a listing of instructor
certified events.
1.12. Examinations. All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations as a
requisite to periodic evaluations. Combat Systems Operators (CSO) and Loadmasters (LM) will
complete combined QUAL/MSN examinations. Pilots must complete separate open and closed
book examinations as a requisite to periodic QUAL and MSN evaluations. Conduct requisite
examinations IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2 Program, as supplemented.

   this volume. Table 2.1 thru Table 2.5 depict specific grading areas for all crew positions
   evaluations. Use criteria in the appropriate crew position chapter for evaluations.
   2.1.2. Administer aircrew evaluations on any flight that as scheduled will accomplish all
   required items for that evaluation. Mission evaluations should be as realistic as possible with
   a minimum of simulated events. Do not deviate from peacetime restrictions.
   2.1.3. In accordance with AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training
   Program, crew resource management (CRM) skills will be evaluated during initial and
   periodic evaluations. CRM skills are integral to all phases of flight; therefore no specific area
   titled CRM exists. Document CRM discrepancies under the seven CRM skills areas: mission
   planning, airmanship/situational awareness, crew coordination, communication, risk
   management/decision making, task management, and briefing/debriefing. Evaluators should
   reference AF Form 4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation Form, and AFI 11-290
   for further clarification.
2.2. Required Evaluations.
   2.2.1. Pilots will be given a combined INSTM/QUAL evaluation and a separate MSN
   evaluation.
   2.2.2. CSO and loadmasters will be given a combined QUAL/MSN evaluation.
   2.2.3. Instructor evaluations are conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2, as supplemented and
   Chapter 3 of this instruction. Thoroughly evaluate the examinee's instructor knowledge and
   ability. Evaluate instructor candidates on a sortie with a representative sampling of unit’s
   basic and/or mission maneuvers that permit accomplishment of all required instructor areas
   IAW Table 2.2 Upon successful completion of the Instructor evaluation, award the crew
   position of IP for pilots, IN for CSOs and IL for Loadmasters on their Form 8. If it is done in
   conjunction with an INSTM/QUAL, MSN, or QUAL/MSN checkride use the instructor crew
   position on the Form 8.
2.3. Currency of Flight Publications. Evaluate all required in-flight publications, including
checklists, for currency and accuracy on all flight evaluations. Required flying publications are
specified in AFI 11-2HC-130J, Volume 3, HC-130J--Operations Procedures.
2.4. Formal Course Evaluations. Fly syllabus evaluations IAW syllabus mission profile
guidelines if stated, or on a mission profile developed from syllabus training objectives. All
required areas must be evaluated for the type of evaluation being flown, IAW guidance in this
volume. Grade training objectives and related areas using the performance criteria in this
volume. Formal course guidelines may be modified, based on local operating considerations or
examiner judgment, to complete the evaluation.

4.2. Objective. IAW the guidelines of this instruction, the examinee must satisfactorily
demonstrate the ability to perform all duties safely and effectively, including the operation of
appropriate aircraft systems, IAW applicable technical orders, directives and published
procedures.
4.3. Requirements.
     4.3.1. Instrument/Qualification. See Table 2.3 for required evaluation areas. Upon
     successful completion of the Instrument/Qualification evaluation, award the crew position of
     FP on their Form 8.
        4.3.1.1. Initial/Re-Qualification Evaluations. C-130J basic initial/re-qualification and
        instructor upgrade are formal training courses. Initial/re-qualification evaluations update
        the eligibility for instrument/qualification evaluations. If an initial or re-qualification
        (return to active flight duties) evaluation is administered in-unit, all required areas from
        Table 2.3 must be evaluated. The unit commander determines the minimum events due
        to ―Q-3‖ or ―out of eligibility‖ re-qualification. Instructor upgrades evaluations may
        update the eligibility for instrument/qualification if requirements in paragraph 4.3.1.2 are
        met. Evaluations may be conducted in any C-130J variant or in a certified C-130J type
        weapon system trainer (WST).
AFI11-2HC-130JV2 21 MARCH 2012                                                                  27


     4.3.1.2. Periodic Instrument/Qualification Evaluations. Instrument evaluations may
     not be conducted separately from qualification evaluations. Pilot instrument/qualification
     evaluations should include approaches to airfields other than home station or deployed
     locations, if possible. Do not complete a periodic instrument qualification evaluation
     unless, as a minimum, the following are observed in flight: an instrument takeoff, one
     precision approach; one non-precision approach; Cat 2 ILS (if qualified), holding or
     procedure turn; circling and VFR pattern; touch and go procedures; both a 100 and 50
     percent flap landing; a simulated 3-engine instrument approach, landing, and go-around
     and a no flap approach and landing. Do not combine the precision and Category II
     approaches. One of the approaches will be flown without use of the autopilot and
     autothrottles. Initial CAT II qualification evaluations require an approach to a missed
     approach and an approach to a landing. CAT II procedures may be evaluated on a CAT I
     approach. Basic qualified pilots may conduct their periodic INSTM/QUAL evaluation
     from either seat. Evaluations may be conducted in any C-130J variant or in a certified C-
     130J type WST.
  4.3.2. Mission. See Table 2.3 for required evaluation areas. Upon successful completion of
  the Mission evaluation, award the crew position of MP on their Form 8.
     4.3.2.1. Requirements for All Mission Evaluations. The requirements listed below in
     paragraphs 4.3.2.1.1 thru 4.3.2.1.4 are applicable to all initial/requalification and periodic
     mission evaluations.
         4.3.2.1.1. HAAR will include a rendezvous and join up with an actual helicopter;
         completion of the pre-contact, contact and post air refueling checklist; and a
         minimum of one wet/dry contact. Exception: The requirement for a wet/dry contact
         may be waived by the evaluator if they determine that receiver ability precluded a
         successful probe to drogue contact. Maximum Effort Procedures. If a landing zone is
         not available, a larger runway with clearly identifiable 500 foot touchdown zone may
         be used. This event is normally accomplished as part of the mission evaluation. NVG
         takeoff/landing may be credited if flown to max effort standards. One go-around is
         permitted, provided the aircraft does not touch down short of the zone.
         4.3.2.1.2. At a minimum, NVG airland requires both an NVG landing and takeoff.
         Normal or maximum effort procedures may be used.
         4.3.2.1.3. Document which tactical events were flown and the type of terrain
         (mountainous or non-mountainous) in which the mission was flown in the comments
         section of the AF Form 8.
         4.3.2.1.4. Mission evaluations may be conducted from either seat, however Max
         Effort landings will be conducted from the left seat. Exception: periodic IP
         evaluation may accomplish Max Effort from either seat.
         4.3.2.1.5. Initial Mission evaluation may be conducted in an HC-130J or MC-130J
         aircraft.
     4.3.2.2. Initial/Re-qualification Mission Evaluations. Initial/re-qualification mission
     qualification is conducted at an AETC formal school or in-unit with MAJCOM waiver
     and updates the eligibility for the mission evaluation. If an initial or re-qualification
     (return to active flight duties) evaluation is administered in-unit, all required areas from
 28                                                      AFI11-2HC-130JV2 21 MARCH 2012


       Table 2.3 must be evaluated. The in-flight evaluation profile will include an NVG low-
       level route flown in mountainous terrain to a time on target/arrival (TOT/TOA) event, an
       HAAR, a system airdrop, a tactical recovery/SCA, NVG airland and a maximum effort
       takeoff and landing.
       4.3.2.3. Periodic Mission Evaluations. The in-flight evaluation profile will include an
       NVG modified-contour low level flown to a time on target/arrival (TOT/TOA) event, a
       maximum effort takeoff and landing, a tactical recovery, NVG airland and either an
       AAR, HAAR or a computed air release point (CARP) airdrop. Airdrop, AAR (if
       qualified) and HAAR will be evaluated in-flight at least every other periodic evaluation.
       The low level will be flown in mountainous terrain at least every other periodic
       evaluation.
   4.3.3. Special Qualifications Evaluations.
   4.3.3.1. Air to Air Refueling Contact is a Special Mission Qualification.                  Once
   accomplished, it will be incorporated into the periodic evaluation.

                     COMBAT SYSTEM OPERATOR EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The criteria contained here and in Chapter 3 apply to all CSO flight evaluations.
5.2. Objective. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform all CSO
duties safely and effectively, including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems, IAW
applicable flight manuals, and directives.
5.3. Requirements.
   5.3.1. Qualification/Mission Evaluations. See Table 2.4 for required evaluation areas. The
   HAAR rendezvous can be to an actual helicopter aircraft or another C-130 flying HAAR
   airspeed. Annotate on the AF Form 8 the type of drop conducted, drop score, TOT/TOA,
   type of low level (LL) flown and if it was conducted in mountainous terrain. Upon successful
   completion of the qualification/mission evaluation, award the crew position of MN on their
   Form 8.
       5.3.1.1. Initial/Requalification Qualification/Mission. Required in-flight evaluation
       profile will include at least 30 minutes of NVG low level to a time on target/arrival
       (TOT/TOA) event. A tactical event is considered to be HAAR, airdrop or SCA/IPRA.
       Though only one TOT/TOA is required, all three events must be observed. Mountainous
       low level is required on all initial evaluations and requalification evaluations where the
       crewmember was unqualified for greater than six months. Evaluators will determine
       threats for the mission evaluation profile. A minimum of one pre-briefed threat will be
       placed on the low-level route. Additionally, at least one non-preplanned threat will be
       given in flight.
       5.3.1.2. Periodic Qualification/Mission. Required in-flight evaluation profile is the
       same as initial/requalification evaluations noted above. Exception: Only two tactical
       events are required, all three are preferable. The third event, if not observed in flight, will
       be evaluated through an alternate method. Do not miss the same tactical event on
       consecutive evaluations (e.g. if SCAs were verbally evaluated on the examinees last
       evaluation, then an SCA must be demonstrated in flight on the next evaluation). NVG
       low level in mountainous terrain must be conducted at least every other evaluation.
       Specific areas identified as basic qualification events (Table 2.4) will be demonstrated to
       the satisfaction of the evaluator during a ground evaluation or in-flight.
       5.3.1.3. Simulator Evaluations. CSOs           may     accomplish     periodic   qualification
       evaluations in a certified HC-130J WST.

will demonstrate instructor duties on all periodic evaluations.
6.2. Objective. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform all
loadmaster duties safely and effectively, including the operation of appropriate aircraft systems
IAW with applicable technical orders, instructions, and directives.
6.3. Requirements. See Tables 2.1, 2.2 (instructor), and 2.5 for required evaluation areas.
Upon successful completion of the qualification/mission evaluation, award the crew position of
ML on their AF Form 8.
   6.3.1. Initial/Requalification QUAL/MSN. The examinee will accomplish an aircraft
   preflight (evaluator discretion as to how much), completion of applicable weight and balance
   forms, a minimum of 30 minutes of NVG low level with the examinee scanning, an NVG
   helicopter air to air refueling (with a contact), an NVG airdrop, and an aircraft post-flight.
   The low level should be flown to either the airdrop or helicopter air to air refueling. The
   airdrop will be a Container Ramp Load (CRL), static line personnel, or Container Delivery
   System (CDS). Examinee will demonstrate knowledge of emergency procedures associated
   with each method of deployment. The evaluator will enter a detailed mission description on
   the AF Form 8.
   6.3.2. Periodic QUAL/MSN. All evaluations should be scheduled with the minimum of
   NVG HAAR and at least one type of night airdrop (CRL, CDS, or static line personnel). The
   examinee will accomplish the applicable aircraft preflight (evaluator discretion as to how
   much) and aircraft weight and balance computations. A minimum of 30 minutes of NVG
   low level will be flown with the examinee scanning and a threat should be called while in-
   flight. At the minimum, one of the following events will be accomplished: NVG HAAR
   (with a contact), night airdrop (CRL, CDS, or Static line personnel only), or infil/exfil
   (tactical car/truck/humvee only; land, load/offload, takeoff). Any other events performed for
   the mission (FARP, hot gas, rescue drops, High Altitude Low Opening (HALO), etc.) will be
   evaluated; any events not performed will be verbally evaluated. The evaluator will enter a
   detailed mission description on the AF Form 8.
