This instruction aligns with AFPD 36-27, Social Actions, and implements AFI 36-2701, Social Actions
Program. It provides guidance for the celebration of special observances at Robins Air Force Base
(RAFB). It is designed to promote savings of materiel, financial, and personnel resources where possible.
It establishes procedures for the total workforce to participate in installation level activities in support of
special observances, with substance and lasting visibility of the EEO and special emphasis programs. It
applies to all military and civilian personnel assigned or attached to Warner Robins Air Logistics Center
(WR-ALC), the 78th Air Base Wing (78 ABW), and all tenant organizations.
SUMMARY OF REVISIONS: This is the initial publication of RAFBI 36-2701. It clarifies the policy
on special observances; updates requirements and responsibilities for funding and budget, host director-
ate, and office of primary responsibility. It deletes Social Actions office requirements; establishes a new
RAFB American Heritage observance, and lists specific duties of key committees and subcommittees.



1. POLICY.
   1.1. National Level. It is Department of Defense (DOD) guidance (DOD Directive 1440.1), and Air
   Force policy to celebrate events which significantly affect minorities, women and people with disabil-
   ities, and that support the Civilian EEO program. Events proclaimed by executive orders will be
   given maximum support by each echelon of command.
   1.2. Local Level. Individual directorates are to refrain from conducting independent activities for
   ethnic observances. All events will be coordinated by the observance committee.
2                                                                                           15 APRIL 1996

2. PURPOSE.
    2.1. The purpose of a special observance is to foster teamwork and awareness throughout the diverse
    military and civilian workforce. The observances are designed to educate personnel on the back-
    ground, social values and accomplishments of individuals or groups.

3. SCOPE OF OPERATIONS .
    3.1. In carrying out the spirit and intent of this instruction, the active involvement of every functional
    manager is required. A permanent office of primary responsibility (OPR) within the Civilian Person-
    nel Division (78 SPTG/DPC), will be appointed to oversee all observances. A host directorate will be
    appointed by the WR-ALC Commander (WR-ALC/CC) for each observance (attachment 2). These
    observances are normally confined to RAFB. To succeed, these events need the active support of mil-
    itary and civilian personnel assigned to the base.

4. ESTABLISHED SPECIAL OBSERVANCES . The following special observances are covered by
this instruction:
    4.1. National Hispanic Heritage Week . This observance began in 1968 as a result of Public Law
    90-498 and a presidential proclamation, and was originally celebrated during the third week of Sep-
    tember, to coincide with Mexican Independence Day, and those of other Latin American Nations.
    The national observance has since been expanded to cover 15 September thru 15 October. The local
    observance week may occur any time during this period.
    4.2. Black History Week . This observance was established by Dr. Carter G. Woodson in 1926 to
    recognize contributions of black Americans. When possible, Black History Week is observed dur-
    ing the second week in February to encompass the birth dates of Abraham Lincoln (12 February) and
    Frederick Douglas (15 February). When this is not possible, the week encompassing the latter's birth
    date is normally designated as Black History Week.
    4.3. Asian-Pacific American Heritage Week . This week was authorized by Presidential Proclama-
    tion Number 4727, 27 February 1980. Special events are observed during the week encompassing 7
    May in recognition of the arrival of the first Japanese immigrants to America in 1843. Additionally,
    the driving of the golden spike on May 8, 1868 is recognized as representative of the contributions of
    Chinese-Americans in the building of this country's transcontinental railroad.
    4.4. American Heritage Week . Headquarters Air Force implemented American Heritage Week in
    1981. The concept and adoption of this multi-cultural/ethnic event is designed to recognize Ameri-
    can's collective heritage with one annual celebration to be scheduled around mission priorities. Air
    Force suggests that the event take place several days before the Fourth of July. This time frame per-
    mits a week of planned activities culminated by a celebration of America's birthday.
    4.5. Native American Heritage Week . November 22-28 was proclaimed as American-Indian
    Week in recognition of unique and essential contributions made by this group of Americans to the
    United States. The observance has now been expanded to the entire month of November. The local
    observance week may occur anytime during this period.
    4.6. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, Memorial . This observance takes place in January of each year,
    centered around the national holiday observed on the third Monday of each year. The Friday prior to
    the national holiday is normally designated as observance at the Base Chapel at Robins AFB.
    WR-ALC base chaplain is host for these annual observances.
 15 APRIL 1996                                                                                          3

  4.7. National Disability Employment Awareness Week. Nationally observed during the month of
  October of each year. The local observance may take place during any one week of the month with
  emphasis on eradicating misconceptions which are major barriers to employment of persons with dis-
  abilities.
  4.8. Womens Equality Day. This observance is in recognition of the Suffrage Amendment (19th),
  dated 26 Aug 1920, which gave women the right to vote. The local observance may occur anytime
  during the week of 26 August. The WR-ALC Federal Women’s Program Committee will be the host
  for this observance.
  Any other observance deemed appropriate by the Center Commander that has been approved at the
  national level may be celebrated in the manner set forth in this instruction. These observances should
  have a demonstrated interest/support.
  4.9. Special Observance Goals and Objectives. These special observances are annual events. The
  objective of these special observances is to foster teamwork and awareness at Robins AFB. When the
  group being recognized is the only one participating the purpose is lost. It’s important to attract mass
  interest and participation. To enhance the value of such events, conglomerate involvement by the
  installation community is essential. Active command support and leadership and thorough planning
  are fundamental elements of success.

5. FUNDING AND BUDGET GUIDANCE .
  5.1. Policy. Adequate funding is an essential element in the success or failure of special observances
  programs. Appropriated funds for ethnic observances are authorized by AFR 172-1, volume I, para.
  4-12 based on available funds and approval by the installation commander. This section provides
  guidance for the conduct of fund raising activities and procedures for the management of funds.
     5.1.1. The host directorate liaison officer should contact the base budget office and the OPR (78th
     SPTG/DPCS) to determine available funds/resources prior to planning any activities. This should
     be accomplished as early as possible to facilitate the planning process. The budget estimate
     should be submitted before planning certain events, not after. Funds allocated for special obser-
     vances should not be spent on other unrelated programs without resource-advisor coordination
     and approval by the installation commander. All activities planned by the observance committees
     will be financed with appropriated funds based on usage rates and per capita number of personnel
     included in a specific heritage event basis.
     5.1.2. Honorariums and speaking fees from O&M type funds are authorized in accordance with
     AFR 172-1, Volume 1, paragraph 4-40a. Each observance committee will submit a proposed bud-
     get to the OPR (78th SPTG/DPCS), including any proposed fund raising activities, for review and
     approval.
     5.1.3. Plans for fund raising activities must also be coordinated with and approved by the Ser-
     vices Division and the host directorate sponsoring the observance.
     5.1.4. The focus of any fund raising activities should be within the theme of reinvestment in the
     community. Examples are: Raising money for local scholarships, educational programs, essay
     contests, etc..
     5.1.5. Unless authorized by the Center Commander, fund-raising events will be limited to the
     installation.
4                                                                                             15 APRIL 1996

       5.1.6. Should appropriated funds not be available, fund raising activities will be limited to five
       per observance.
    5.2. Funds Management.
       5.2.1. The planning subcommittee must coordinate with the finance subcommittee to make sure
       planned activities do not exceed operating budget. Host directorate assumes financial responsibil-
       ity for any overages.
       5.2.2. Finance subcommittee keeps a ledger showing income and outflow of cash.
       5.2.3. Release of funds require signature of the host liaison (or designee) in addition to the base
       OPR.
       5.2.4. At the conclusion of the celebration all remaining funds obtained through fund-raisers will
       be placed in a financial account for the next years celebration. The base OPR will oversee this
       account.

6. ORGANIZATION.
    6.1. Observance Committee (OC). OCs are base established and self-sustaining committees. These
    OCs are integral parts of the military service or federal entities.
    6.2. Types of OCs. OCs are established and operated to fulfill the needs and interests of DoD fami-
    lies under the direction of the Center Commander (or designated representative). OCs have the ability
    to generate limited funds to support their direct expenses in sponsoring functions. The following
    paragraphs list some examples of different types of OCs and an explanation of their function.
       6.2.1. Steering Committee . These individuals plan the special observances, track progress, and
       cross-feed information (program innovations, achievements, problem solutions, and lessons
       learned). They also assure that invitations to special guests, e.g., community leaders and other
       dignitaries, are drafted for the Center Commander's signature. This committee is also the focal
       point for all budgeting requirements unless a finance subcommittee is appointed. Pertinent
       responsibilities include: Reviewing plans of the event to determine financial requirements; verifi-
       cation of funding needs with subcommittee chairpersons; coordinating Air Force Form 9 require-
       ments (preparation and timeliness of contracts) and maintaining a financial ledger to balance the
       budget and account for all expenditures.
       6.2.2. Program Subcommittees . These committees develop a schedule of planned activities,
       provide accompanying cost estimates; help secure local resources/facilities; obtain guest speakers,
       films and/or tape recordings; arrange for community exhibits and displays; duplicate program
       leaflets; and prepare draft invitations and "thank you" letters for the Center Commander's signa-
       ture as appropriate. Some suggested subcommittees are: Luncheon, Banquet, Education, Hospi-
       tality, Publicity, etc..
       6.2.3. NOTE : All program committees and subcommittees should prepare an after action report,
       itemizing all expenses and payments, problems encountered, and lessons learned. These reports
       should be condensed and consolidated into the project officers after action report or attached to the
       host directorate liaison officer's after action report. The liaison officer's final report should be for-
       warded to the OPR NLT thirty days after the observance/event which formally signals the dis-
       banding of all committees and subcommittees related to the specific observance.
 15 APRIL 1996                                                                                           5

7. RESPONSIBILITIES.
  7.1. Center Commander. Once the WR-ALC/CC determines that a special observance will make a
  positive contribution to the base populace, he/she authorizes the establishment of an OC through the
  appointment of a host directorate for the celebration. The Commander may withdraw his/her authori-
  zation if the OC prejudices or discredits the United States government, conflicts with national govern-
  ment activities, or for any other reasonable or just cause.
  7.2. Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). The OPR (Civilian Personnel) acts on behalf of the
  Center Commander to ensure quality programs are presented and provides authoritative guidance and
  recommendations to the host director and those assigned to plan/implement programs. The OPR
  advises the OC and ensures proper coordination (WR-ALC/JA, 78 SPTG/SV, and WR-ALC/PA) of
  all events/functions. The OPR is the repository for policy, records, and historical data.
  7.3. Host Directorate . The host directorate will appoint a liaison and co-liaison representative to
  plan, coordinate, and implement a quality program. The host directorate will prepare a letter for the
  center commander’s signature which tasks each directorate and tenant unit to officially appoint an
  individual and an alternate to represent its unit during the official observance period and attend the
  executive committee meetings. A sample appointment letter is provided at attachment 1. Appointed
  individuals from each directorate will query their respective organization to determine if there are any
  additional willing committee participants to sit on working groups. The appointed individual will
  then submit a list of prospective participants within the directorate to the director who will approve or
  disapprove participants as he/she determines appropriate. Supervisors should be provided a copy of
  the list of participants and should monitor committee meetings and work in accordance with mission
  requirements. The liaison and co-liaison of the host directorate as well as the directorate participants
  should possess the following prerequisites:
     7.3.1. Desire to participate
     7.3.2. Empathy
     7.3.3. Objectivity
     7.3.4. Perceptiveness
     7.3.5. Maturity
     7.3.6. Commitment
     7.3.7. Availability
     7.3.8. Understanding of diversity
     7.3.9. Knowledge of the subject matter
     7.3.10. Effective communication skills

8. PUBLICITY
  8.1. According to AFR 190-1, Public Affairs (PA) is the primary means for supporting Air Force mis-
  sions with the informed "public sentiment..." The mission of Public Affairs is to advise and assist
  commanders in communicating Air Force messages to Air Force people and the American public.
  Regarding ethnic observances, Public Affairs will provide publicity for both external and internal
  media including various newspaper articles, television coverage, radio spots and the like. PA will be
6                                                                                        15 APRIL 1996

    able to assist with press releases and media escort duty. PA, Judge Advocate (JA), and Services Divi-
    sion (SV) personnel will work closely with the directorate liaison, but will not be required to attend
    all observance committee meetings. The Public Affairs Office (WR-ALC/PA), Staff Judge Advo-
    cate.

9. PROTOCOL.
    9.1. Protocol is the observance of the order of precedence at all functions where the Center Com-
    mander, Directors, Deputies and Staff Officers or their representatives are present. The same is true
    in seating the aforementioned individuals and guests of a public or private organization at luncheons,
    banquets and formal functions sponsored or held by WR-ALC. All questions regarding proper proto-
    col for any function must be forwarded to the WR-ALC Protocol Office (WR-ALC/CCX).

10. CIVILIAN PERSONNEL.
    10.1. The following (para. 10.2) is a summary of an Air Force Civilian Personnel Policy Division
    Advisory Letter, subject: Policy guidance on duties for Special Emphasis Program Manager (SEPMs),
    dated 10 May 1994.
    10.2. Roles of Special Emphasis Program (SEP) Managers in Observances . S p e ci a l O b s e r -
    vances should not be a SEP initiative. Those activities should be conducted as base-wide activities,
    planned and conducted by an ad hoc committee composed of military members and civilian employ-
    ees. SEPMs should participate as members of the ad hoc committee, assisting in the development and
    implementation of special activities that affect minorities, women and disabled persons.
    10.3. Duty Time to Plan Observance . Planning official base functions is a part of an employee's
    regular duty (other duties as assigned). Recommend planning meetings be limited to a reasonable
    amount of time (30 minutes to 1-1/2 hours). However, the primary responsibility for observing time
    limits rests with the host organization Liaison Officer.
    10.4. Duty Time to Attend Observance . See 78 SPTG/DPC letter dated 10 March 1995, subject:
    Policy for Excused Absences.

                                  SUGGESTIONS FOR PLANNING
SPECIAL OBSERVANCES

A2.1. The two most important elements to ensure a successful program ceremony are planning and coor-
dinating. Planning in detail and coordinating with command and support officers are critical-from the
very first discussion of a program through the closing of the historical file.

A2.2. This Observance Guide includes material to assist in the planning and conduct of special obser-
vances. The tools in this planning guide are provided as examples which may provide useful to the Liai-
son Officer and the Observance Committees.

A2.3. It is suggested that planners make use of all locally available resources in planning a special obser-
vance. Members of the staff, library personnel, and people in the local community may be anxious to
assist in the planning and/or conduct of an observance. Also, some of the special interest groups or their
families may want to help in some way without actually participating in the ceremony.

A2.4. As with all programs of a professional nature conducted on or with the assistance of a military
installation, the planning process must be conducted in a meticulous manner, and preferably with the use
of milestones and detailed checklist. The following sample checklist should be adjusted to fit needs and
situations so that the resulting program is appropriate for the military and civilian audience and the set-
ting.

A2.5. One should never lose sight of the purpose for observances. We observe to learn. The emphasis is
therefore education.

Note for the newly-appointed project officers: This checklist is, of necessity, general in nature. Never-
theless, it is based on extensive experience in the planning and conduct of a wide variety of special obser-
vances. It is expected that you and your committee will need to tailor this checklist to meet local
requirements, to conform with command guidance, and to be consistent with command or installation
standing operating procedures. Items in the following checklist are not necessarily accomplished sequen-
tially.
CHECKLIST ITEMS
A3.1. Contact appropriate installation/local organizations (e.g., Public Affairs; Services; Commanders
Action Group (CAG); Command section; Staff Chaplain, etc) to compare calendar of events for installa-
