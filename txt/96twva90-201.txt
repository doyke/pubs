                                              PROGRAM MANAGEMENT
 The primary purpose of the Self-Assessment (SA) Program (SAP) is to accurately identify and report issues to the command
 chain. Self-assessments provide commanders a means for internal assessment of a wing's overall health and complements
 external assessments. To be truly effective, the inspection process must be an active, ongoing effort with full leadership
 support. NOTE: Compliance with the items in a self-assessment checklist does not relieve individual Airmen from knowing the
 requirements of their programs and complying with guidance in the Air Force Instructions and other policy documents.
