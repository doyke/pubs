                                           Chapter 1

 CHARACTERIZATION UNIT (CU) & EXPLOITATION UNIT (EU) INTERACTIONS

1.1. General. The CU or 15th Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) located at Scott AFB, and
the EU, or 88th Operations Support Squadron Weather Flight (88 OSS/OSW), are the official
weather support agencies for Wright Patterson AFB. These agencies provide weather
information in support of the 88th Air Base Wing (88 ABW), the 445th Airlift Wing (445 AW),
the 55th Wing which supports both NAOC operations and the Defense Threat Reduction
Agency’s (DTRA) Open Skies program, the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC),
subordinate units, and units assigned, attached, or supported by Wright-Patterson AFB. The 88
OSS/OSW is commonly referred to as the Weather Flight (WF) and is the focal point for all
weather-related support. This instruction will be reviewed and revised no greater than biennially
or IAW with host/parent unit procedures if the time is less than biennially.
   1.1.1. The 15 OWS is designated as the CU for the air and space environment for the
   Northeast Continental United States (CONUS). Characterization encompasses the “collect,
   analyze and predict” weather core competencies. Characterization of the environment is
   dependent on Air Force Weather’s ability to collect accurate data, correctly analyze the data,
   and use the results to produce a coherent picture of the present and future state of the air and
   space environment.
   1.1.2. The 88 OSS/OSW is designated the EU for WPAFB. Exploitation is defined as the
   ability to minimize the impact of environmental threats to friendly forces while
   simultaneously capitalizing on environmental conditions that maximize the effectiveness of
   ground, air, and space operations. EUs tailor the characterization provided by the CU and
   apply pertinent data to a specific mission profile based on the overall characterization of the
   air and space environment. Tailoring does not mean changing the characterization. To the
   greatest extent possible, the EU will collaborate with the CU during the characterization of
   the environment to ensure air and space conditions can be exploited to meet customer’s
   planning, operations, and mission requirements.
1.2. Concept of Operations.
   1.2.1. The 15 OWS at Scott AFB, Illinois, provides regional and operational-level weather
   products and information to Air Force and Army units in the Northeast region of the
   CONUS. The 15 OWS performs a continuous Meteorological Watch or METWATCH for
   WPAFB. METWATCH is a deliberate, continuous process for monitoring terrestrial
   weather or the space environment in an area or region. The purpose of a METWATCH is to
   identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge from forecast conditions,
   determine courses of action to update or amend a forecast product or group of products, and
   notify designated agencies. Notification of changes to products during the METWATCH is
   coordinated with the base WF.
   1.2.2. The 88 OSS/OSW is the primary source of mission-tailored weather services for the
   88 ABW, 445 AW, and other organizations, activities, or aircrew requiring weather services.
   The WF will make every effort to ensure that mission-limiting weather is analyzed and
   exploited to meet the safety and resource protection requirements of WPAFB and its
   customers. Meteorological services provided are detailed in Chapters 2 – 4.

1.3. Responsibilities.
     1.3.1. General responsibilities of the CU, or OWS, and EU, or WF, are outlined in AFI 15-
     128, Chapters 4 and 6.
     1.3.2. CU (15 OWS) Responsibilities. The 15 OWS issues the WPAFB Terminal
     Aerodrome Forecast (TAF), forecast weather watches, warnings, and advisories, and if
     required, may provide flight weather briefings to transient aircrews passing through WPAFB
     if local services are unavailable. The OWS will issue observed warnings and advisories
     when the WF is closed or unable to issue observed warnings and advisories.
     1.3.3. EU (88 OSS/OSW) Responsibilities. The WF will create Mission Weather Products
     (MWPs) that fuse theater scale products with local mission requirements to enable the direct
     inject of weather impacts into warfighter planning and/or execution. Upon request, the WF
     will provide flight weather briefings and operational weather support for hosted and transient
     aircrew IAW the WF duty priorities listed in Table 1.1 The WF also acts as the “eyes
     forward” for the OWS by relaying significant, time-sensitive meteorological information not
     found in coded meteorological reports to assist the 15 OWS in forecast operations. The WF
     issues all observed advisories and warnings.
     1.3.4. WPAFB Installation Data Page. The 15 OWS and WPAFB WF will coordinate and
     maintain a WPAFB Installation Data Page detailing TAF specification and amendment
     criteria, WWA thresholds, desired lead times, mission impacts, unit information, Joint
     Environmental Toolkit (JET) back-up contacts, and local outage back-up information.
1.4. Duty Priorities. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, para 1.3.3.1., the WF has created the following
duty priorities based on supported mission requirements.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI15-101 8 AUGUST 2014                                                                   7

1.6. Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). Both the WF and 15 OWS require COOPs to
address continuing operations in the event of a disaster or emergency.
     1.6.1. WF COOP and WF Alternate Operating Location (AOL). In the event of a
     communication outage or building evacuation, the WF will move to building 101 (445 AW
     Mission Support Group building), Room 153, Comm (937) 904-3935 / DSN 674-3935. WF
     members will follow duty-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) and evacuation
     checklists (including a list of required back-up equipment) and resume services at the AOL
     as soon as possible. The flight will continue operational support and resume eyes forward
     responsibilities for the OWS. If access to observing sensing equipment readouts is lost,
     manual equipment will be used to take observations. Most WF services/support will be
     provided, but will require a case-by-case assessment depending on communication line
     status, equipment status, etc. Expect most services to be somewhat degraded (weather
     products, pilot briefings, etc.) due to limited facilities and loss of dedicated data services,
     including sensors and various data types (meteorological satellite (METSAT), radar imagery,
     etc.). For flight safety reasons, the WF will not evacuate during base exercises.
     1.6.2. 15 OWS COOP.
        1.6.2.1. For short term 15 OWS outages (up to 72 hours), the WF will assume local TAF
        and weather watch, warning and advisory responsibility.
        1.6.2.2. For long-term outages (greater than 72 hours), the 15 OWS will resume support
        from an alternate location to the greatest extent possible.
        1.6.2.3. Exercises. In coordination with the WPAFB WF, the 15 OWS will conduct
        periodic COOP exercises where the WF will take responsibility for short-term operations,
        to include items listed in 1.6.2.1 above.

                                   AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions affecting the WPAFB aerodrome (defined
within 5NM of the base as a whole).
2.2. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-111,
Surface Weather Observations, utilizing the Fixed Meteorological Equipment (FMQ-19)
Automated Meteorological Observing System (AMOS).                Most observations are taken
automatically by the FMQ-19 with no human intervention. At times, it is necessary for a
weather forecaster to augment or supplement the system. Automated and augmentation
processes are outlined in para 2.2.7 During certain inclement weather conditions, augmented
and manual observations may need to be taken when the FMQ-19 is unreliable or inoperable or
safety of flight or operations is impacted. Conditions and thresholds warranting augmented and
manual observations are defined in local WF procedures. The following observations are created
and disseminated:
   2.2.1. Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR). METAR observations are created
   between 45 and 59 minutes after every hour. METARs are disseminated both locally and
   long-line between 55 and 59 minutes after the hour.
   2.2.2. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI). A SPECI is an unscheduled
   observation completed and transmitted when any of the WPAFB Special criteria listed in
   Attachment 3 have been observed or sensed. SPECIs will contain all data elements found in
   a METAR plus additional remarks that elaborates on data in the body of the report. All
   SPECI reports will be prepared and transmitted as soon as possible after the relevant criteria
   are observed. Attachment 5 contains an example SPECI weather observation.
   2.2.3. Aviation Selected Local Weather Report (LOCAL). During augmentation, the WF
   will take single element LOCAL observations for altimeter setting changes.
   2.2.4. Official Observing Points. The official observing point is the location of the FMQ-
   19 sensors located on the North and South ends of the airfield. Under normal circumstances,
   the sensor on the North end of the airfield will be used. During periods of augmentation and
   manual observations, the observation point will be approximately 50 feet away from the
   West side of building 206 (South Hangar). If augmentation is required during relocations to
   the AOL the observation point is the north side of Building 101 on the flight-line next to the
   metal drainage grate. The AOL elevation is the same as the official observing elevation of
   823 feet.
   2.2.5. Observing Point Limitations.
       2.2.5.1. Both FMQ-19 sensors are properly sited and no limitations are currently noted.
       2.2.5.2. Augmented observations taken at the primary augmentation site are degraded
       because the observer’s view to the east is blocked by an aircraft hangar and surrounding
       buildings. Thunder may not be heard due to flightline noise.
       2.2.5.3. Augmented observations taken at the AOL are degraded because view to the east
       is blocked by buildings.

  2.2.6. Automated FMQ-19 Observation. An automated observation is any observation
  having been evaluated, prepared, and transmitted by an observing system without human
  intervention. In automated mode, the FMQ-19 observing system will record and disseminate
  weather observations. The FMQ-19 uses time averaging of sensor data. In an automated
  observation, sky condition will be an evaluation of sensor data gathered during the 30-minute
  period ending at the actual time of the observation. All other elements evaluated are based
  on sensor data that is within 10 minutes or less of the actual time of the observation.
  2.2.7. Forecaster FMQ-19 Augmentation. Augmentation is the process of having a
  certified weather forecaster manually add or edit data to an observation generated by the
  FMQ-19. WF personnel will augment the FMQ-19 IAW locally developed procedures. The
  two augmentation processes used are supplementing and back up.
     2.2.7.1. Supplementing (definition). Supplemental observations are defined as
     manually adding meteorological information to an observation generated by the FMQ-19
     that is beyond that system’s capability to measure and report. For example, the sensor
     cannot sense a tornado or hail.
     2.2.7.2. Supplementing procedures. WF personnel will supplement observations when
     the weather conditions in Table 2.1, Mandatory Supplementary Weather Conditions or
     Table 2.2, Local Supplementary Weather Conditions, are observed. Weather personnel
     are prepared to supplement observations whenever a watch or warning has been issued
     for tornadic activity.

       2.2.7.3. Backup (definition). The process of manually providing meteorological data
       and/or dissemination of an FMQ-19 generated observation when the primary automated
       method is not operational or is unavailable due to sensor and/or communication failure.
       2.2.7.4. Backup procedures. In the event of an FMQ-19 malfunction or failure, back-
       up procedures will be implemented. WF personnel will use manual observing procedures
       when performing back-up operations. When required, the WF will encode and
       disseminate METAR and SPECI observations IAW AFMAN 15-111 Table 3.2 and local
       backup procedures. All element entries must be observed within 15 minutes of the actual
       time of the observation with the exception of wind gusts and squalls, which are reported
       only if they are observed within 10 minutes of the time of the observation. When utilizing
       back-up equipment, all wind and pressure values must be recorded as estimated.
2.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) Support. WPAFB TAFs are produced and
disseminated by the 15 OWS IAW AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-124, AFMAN 15-129V1, and the
WPAFB Installation Data Page. Attachment 4 lists forecast specification and amendment
criteria. TAFs are valid for 30 hours, apply to the area within the 5NM area of the WPAFB
airfield complex, and will be issued at 0300, 1100, and 1900 Zulu time. Attachment 5 contains
examples of typical WPAFB TAFs.
2.4. Resource Protection (RP) Support & Watches, Warnings, and Advisories
(WWA). The 15 OWS conducts a continuous meteorological watch to identify and assess
emerging and imminent threats to WPAFB. Special Weather Statements (SWS) and Watches,
Warnings, and Advisories are special notices provided by the 15 OWS resulting from both the
forecast and METWATCH processes to assist military decision-makers with operational safety
and resource protection decisions. Advisories provide specific notice to an operational agency of
environmental phenomena with the potential to impact operations. Watches and warnings
provide notice of weather events posing a hazard to life or property. Weather Warning criteria
and customer responses are listed in Attachment 6.
   2.4.1. Special Weather Statements (SWS). SWSs are special notices issued by the 15 OWS
   to assist military decision makers with RP decisions.
   2.4.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice to installation
   personnel/supported units of a potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to
   pose a hazard to life or property. They are used by installation personnel/supported units to
   make force protection and risk management decisions. Watches are issued for a 5NM radius
   of the center point of the Wright Patterson airfield and are defined on the 15 OWS Wright-
   Patterson Installation Data Page, WWA Criteria Tab, and in Table 2.3, below.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI15-101 8 AUGUST 2014                                                      13

   established weather condition of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property is
   occurring or is expected to occur. Weather warnings provide concise information outlining
   environmental threats and are used by commanders and personnel to make RP decisions and
   take protective action. Warnings are issued for a 5NM radius (Lightning 10NM) at the
   center point of the runway and are defined on the 15 OWS Wright-Patterson Installation Data
   Page, WWA Criteria Tab, and in Table 2.4, below.

   2.4.4. Observed Weather Warnings. Lightning warnings are the only observed warning
   issued for WPAFB and extends 10NM in all directions from the airfield. Lightning warnings
   are not issued until lightning is observed, either visually or via the National Lightning
   Detection Network. The lightning warning will remain valid until lightning is no longer
   observed within 10NM for at least 15 minutes. Exception: A lightning warning will not be
   cancelled if a thunderstorm is within 5NM (as indicated on radar). All observed WWAs will
   be issued by the WF during normal duty hours. If the WF is not able to issue observed
   Warnings/Advisories the OWS will provide observed WWA coverage.
   2.4.5. Weather Advisories. A weather ADVISORY is a special product notifying an end
   user when an established environmental condition effecting operations is occurring or is
   expected to occur on WPAFB and are defined on the 15 OWS Wright-Patterson Data Page,
   WWA Criteria Tab, and in Table 2.5, below.

Notes:
1. Local criteria defined in local procedures for supported mission.

   2.4.6. WWA Numbering Scheme. Advisories, watches, and warnings are numbered
   consecutively by identifying the type of weather message (watch, warning, or advisory)
   followed by a five-digit number. The first two numbers indicate the current month while the
   second three numbers indicate the sequence number. For example, the message “Weather
   Warning 02-005” means the month is February (02) and this is the fifth (005) warning issued
   in the month. The message “Weather Advisory 12-013” means the month is December (12)
   and this is the thirteenth (013) advisory issued in the month. Examples of different messages
   are contained in Attachment 5. The 15 OWS normally assigns WWA numbers.
   2.4.7. WWA Upgrades/Downgrades. WWAs will be upgraded (i.e., winds increase from
   35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead
   times specified in Table 2.3, and Table 2.4. Only one warning will be in effect at a given
   time (and will include multiple warning criteria as required) except for forecast tornado
   warnings and/or observed lightning warnings. Tornado and lightning will be separate
   warnings. With the exception of tornado and lightning warnings, if a warning is issued for
   one criteria and it becomes necessary to warn for another criteria, a new warning and new
   number will be issued, to include all criteria expected. A separate valid time may be
   specified for each criteria if necessary. The 15 OWS has primary responsibility for
   upgrading and downgrading WWAs.
 16                                   WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI15-101 8 AUGUST 2014


   2.4.8. WWA Amendments. When WWAs no longer adequately describe the phenomenon's
   expected occurrence, a completely new WWA with a new number will be issued. The
   amendment will clearly state how the amendment or extension affects any previously issued
   notices. The 15 OWS has primary responsibility for amending WWAs.
   2.4.9. WWA Extensions. WWAs may be extended provided the extension is issued prior to
   the expiration of the original notice. The 15 OWS has primary responsibility for extending
   forecasted WWAs.
   2.4.10. WWA Cancellation. Warnings and watches are canceled when the weather
   phenomena is no longer occurring or expected to occur. Warnings not extended or canceled
   will automatically expire at the end of the valid period. Observed advisories will be canceled
   when the criteria is no longer occurring and have not occurred in the last 30 minutes. The 15
   OWS has primary responsibility for cancelling WWAs.
2.5. Dissemination Process.
   2.5.1. Observations. Observations taken by either the FMQ-19 automated observing system
   or the weather technician are disseminated via JET or the interface to the WPAFB
   Information Dissemination System (IDS) for airfield support functions. When JET is non-
   operational, the WF will relay observations to the following local organizations in order of
   priority listed in Table 2.5 Observations may be submitted via AF-WEBS longline, if JET is
   unavailable.

Table 2.6. Notification Priority
 1. Tower commercial (937) 257-7840
 2. AFMC Command Post commercial (937) 257-6314
 3. 445 AW Command Post commercial (937) 257-3551
 4. Airfield Operations (88 OSS/OSAM) commercial (937) 257-2131
 5. 15 OWS

   2.5.2. TAFs. The 15 OWS normally issues and disseminates the TAF for WPAFB via JET
   and the 15 OWS TAF Collaboration tool. If JET is non-operational, the WF will disseminate
   TAFs to ATC, 88 ABW/CP, and 445 ABW/CP via telephone, fax, or e-mail.
   2.5.3. SWSs. SWSs provide advance notice of widespread hazardous weather conditions
   that have the potential to impact WPAFB. The 15 OWS transmits SWSs to WF leadership
   via email. WF leadership forwards SWSs to 88 OSS, 88 ABW, and 445 AW leadership
   when weather conditions have the potential to impact operations.
   2.5.4. WWAs. The 15 OWS or WF will enter WWAs into JET to disseminate the
   information directly or via other dissemination systems, to ATC, AFMC/A3XC (Command
   Post), 445 AW/CP, and Airfield Management. If JET is out-of-service, the WF will make or
   coordinate back-up calls through AFMC/A3XC. Upon notification, these units will further
   disseminate all WWAs using the pyramid notification scheme shown in Figure 2.1. In
   addition, the AFMC Command Post disseminates all WWAs via E-Mail and/or automated
   notification systems.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI15-101 8 AUGUST 2014                                                  17


      2.5.4.1. Lightning Warning Notification. All lightning warnings are disseminated by
      the AFMC Command Post to the base populace via the WPAFB At Hoc Computer Alert
      Systems and the base’s Giant Voice system, allowing members on base to be prepared for
      dangerous weather.
      2.5.4.2. Tornado Warning Notification. The AFMC Command Post has the primary
      responsibility for sounding the base siren for a tornado warning issuance.

2.6. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). The WF and ATC have established a CWW as
required by AFI 13-204V3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs, and AFMAN 15-
111. The agreement outlines ATC’s responsibility to notify the WF when ATC personnel
observe specific meteorological phenomena. Of primary concern is the report of tower visibility
differing from the prevailing surface visibility, local PIREPs, and any occurrence of previously
unreported weather conditions that could affect flight safety or be critical to the safety or
efficiency of other local operations and resources. All WF technicians must thoroughly
understand and be able to execute every element in the local cooperative weather watch
agreement. The WF maintains operating procedures for supporting the CWW program.
   2.6.1. WPAFB Tower personnel will notify weather personnel when:
       2.6.1.1. Tower visibility is less than 4 statute miles (6000 meters) and different from the
       surface prevailing visibility. This information is not included in observations produced
       by the FMQ-19.
       2.6.1.2. The altimeter setting (ALSTG) from the AFAS/IDS-5 (FMQ-19 interface)
       become unreadable or suspect. If this occurs, weather technicians will implement back-
       up (manual) observing procedures to generate an altimeter setting observation at an
       interval not to exceed 35 minutes since the last determination. This value will be
       reported (as a single element LOCAL or in a METAR or SPECI taken within the
       established time interval) when there has been a change of 0.01 inches of Mercury (Hg)
       or more since the last locally disseminated value.
       2.6.1.3. PIREPs are received of previously unreported weather conditions that could
       affect flight safety or be critical to the safety and efficiency of other local operations and
       resources.
       2.6.1.4. Thunder is first heard.
       2.6.1.5. Lightning is first observed.

                                          Chapter 5

                                 WEATHER EQUIPMENT

5.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on backup
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
5.2. Meteorological Equipment. The WF uses the FMQ-19, JET, DoD, Air Force,
commercial, and educational products and capabilities to determine the current state of the
atmosphere. These critical systems provide forecasters the most timely, accurate, and relevant
weather data and products available.
   5.2.1. FMQ-19 (AMOS). The FMQ-19 samples, measures, and reports: temperature, wind
   speed and direction, visibility, cloud base height and amount of coverage, pressure, liquid
   equivalent precipitation accumulation, and ice accretion during freezing precipitation. These
   measurements are processed to create properly formatted, fully automated observations that
   comply with applicable various reporting standards and protocols defined in the Federal
   Meteorological Handbook (FMH-1), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Weather Service (NWS), and military
   reporting standards.
   5.2.2. Gibson Ridge (GR) Radar Products. The WF utilizes the AFWA-procured GR
   doppler weather radar output as its primary source of radar data. Weather technicians use GR
   to analyze complex radar signatures and obtain detailed information on storm intensity,
   movement, internal circulation, and general wind flow. Weather technicians will routinely
   incorporate the radar information into MEFs and resource protection products. Radar
   products are used extensively during severe weather events.
5.3. Communications Equipment. The following systems are the backbone of the WF
communications network:
   5.3.1. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET). As discussed in Paragraph 2.5, of this
   instruction, the JET is the primary system for disseminating forecast, observations, warnings,
   watches, and advisories. Telephones are used as a backup for communicating or
   disseminating WWAs.
   5.3.2. PMSV Radio. The PMSV Radio (348.4MHz) allows the WF to communicate with
   aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as tower personnel. If the PMSV is out-of-
   service at WPAFB, aircrew can contact Grissom ARB, using the same frequency, 348.4 MHz
   for assistance with gathering meteorological information.
   5.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines serve primarily for rapidly passing along
   critical, time-sensitive information, as well as to serve for backup services.
   5.3.4. Local Area Network (LAN). The WF relies heavily on the LAN to improve the
   timeliness and accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers.

   5.4.1. Restoral Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems are documented in the
   event natural disasters or any other anomaly, simultaneously impact weather systems and
   capabilities. Significant indicates a situation where the equipment is completely inoperative,
   while minimal means the equipment is in limited operation. The priorities for weather
   equipment are listed in Table 5.2, below (priorities may be adjusted based on forecasted
   weather):

5.5. Backup Power. In the event of a commercial power interruption, weather equipment
housed in Bldg 206 will automatically switch to backup generator power. Critical WF systems
are also supported by an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS), that will provide extended power to
critical systems if both commercial and generator power are lost.

       A2.1.6.1. Begins (Note: A Special observation is not required to report the beginning of
       a new thunderstorm if one is currently reported as in progress at the airfield).
       Thunderstorms begin with Vicinity Thunderstorms - VCTS (5-10 nm from station) or
       Thunderstorms on station – TS (0-4 nm).
       A2.1.6.2. Ends (Note: 15 minutes after the last occurrence of criteria for a
       thunderstorm; an audible sound of thunder, lightning within five NM of the airfield, etc.).
   A2.1.7. Precipitation.
       A2.1.7.1. Hail begins or ends.
       A2.1.7.2. Freezing precipitation or ice pellets begins, ends, or changes intensity.
       A2.1.7.3. Any other type of precipitation begins or ends. Note: Except for freezing rain,
       freezing drizzle, hail, and ice pellets, a Special observation is not required for changes in
       type (e.g., drizzle changing to snow grains) or the beginning or ending of one type while
       another is in progress (e.g., snow changing to rain and snow).
   A2.1.8. Tornado, Funnel Cloud, or Waterspout.           Single-element special observation is
   needed.
       A2.1.8.1. Observed and/or disappears from sight.
   A2.1.9. Runway Visual Range (RVR). WF will provide RVR output according to the
   specifications listed in Table A3.3

Table A2.3. RVR Reporting
Runway Visual Range (RVR)
- Prevailing visibility first observed < 1SM/1600 meters, again when prevailing visibility goes
above 1SM/1600 meters.
- RVR for active runway decrease to less than or, if below, increase to equal or exceed:
       - 6,000 feet
       - 5, 500 feet (FLIP requirement)
       - 5,000 feet
       - 2,400 feet
       - 2,000 feet
- All published RVR minima applicable to the runway in use.
- RVR is first determined as unavailable (RVRNO) for the runway is use, and when it is first
determined that the RVRNO report is no longer applicable, provided conditions for reporting
RVR exist.

   A2.1.10. Nuclear Accident. When notified of a real-world nuclear accident, take and
   disseminate (locally and longline) a SPECI. Append the remark "AEROB" as the last
   remark on the SPECI.
WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI15-101 8 AUGUST 2014                                                       37


  A2.1.11. Resumption of Observing Services. Take, disseminate, and record a SPECI
  within 15 minutes after returning to duty following a break in hourly coverage, if a METAR
  was not filed as scheduled during the 15-minute period.
  A2.1.12. Aircraft Mishap. When notified of an aircraft mishap, the WF will check the
  latest AN/FMQ-19 observation (i.e., METAR/SPECI/OMO (one minute observation) and
  perform augmentation/back-up if required. When operating in a back-up mode WF will
  immediately take a SPECI observation IAW AFI 15-111.
  A2.1.13. Miscellaneous. Any other meteorological situation that in the weather technician’s
  opinion is critical.
     A2.1.13.1. Upon request from the ATC tower.
     A2.1.13.2. Ten minutes prior to the landing or departure of Air Force One.
     A2.1.13.3. Wind observations when suspected FMQ-19 erroneous readings. The
     weather specialist will inform Air Traffic Control (ATC) once the FMQ-19 winds are
     suspected to be erroneous. If no SPECI criteria are met during the period of suspect
     winds, the weather specialist will disseminate a full element special observation at 15, 30,
     and 45 minutes past the hour for ATC to use until the FMQ-19 is deemed reliable again.
     A2.1.13.4. ALERT WEATHER OBSERVATION. Take and disseminate an ALERT
     WEATHER OBSERVATION within 1 minute of alert notification, either verbal or by
     the flashing alert beacon in the operations area.

                                          feet or meters.
Present Weather              A5.8.        Any weather occurring at the observing location,
                                          obscurations to vision, or other phenomena.
Sky Condition                A5.9.        State of the sky in terms of sky cover, layers and
                                          heights, ceilings and obscurations.
Temperature and Dew Point    A5.10.       Measure of hotness/coldness of ambient air. Dew
                                          point measures saturation point temperature.

WRIGHTPATTERSONAFBI15-101 8 AUGUST 2014                                                     43


A4.1. Type of Report. METAR or SPECI.
A4.2. Station identifier, also called the ICAO. This code identifies the location of the
observation (in this case WPAFB).
A4.3. Date and Time of Report. This is in Zulu (GMT) of the last element of the observation.
A4.4. Report Modifier. The report modifier can be either of the following two elements:
   A4.4.1. COR is entered into the report modifier group when a corrected METAR or SPECI
   is transmitted.
   A4.4.2. AUTO identifies the report as a fully automated report with no human intervention.
       A4.4.2.1. AUTO is automatically included in reports when the weather technician signs
       off the AMOS indicating the observations are no longer being augmented.
       A4.4.2.2. AUTO and COR will not be seen in the same observation. If the term COR is
       used, the observation cannot be reported as AUTO, since a weather technician is
       manually correcting the observation.
A4.5. Wind. The true direction the wind is blowing from is encoded in tens of degrees using
three figures. Directions less than 100 degrees are preceded with a "0." The wind speed is
entered as a two or three digit group immediately following the wind direction.
   A4.5.1. Gust. The wind gust is encoded in two or three digits immediately following the
   wind speed. The wind gust is encoded in whole knots using the units and tens digits and, if
   required, the hundreds digit.
   A4.5.2. Variable Wind Direction (speeds 6 knots or less). Variable wind direction with
   wind speed 6 knots or less may be encoded as VRB in place of the direction.
   A4.5.3. Variable Wind Direction (speeds greater than 6 knots). Wind direction varying
   60 degrees or more with wind speed greater than 6 knots will be encoded. The variable wind
   direction group will immediately follow the wind group. The directional variability will be
   encoded in a clockwise direction. For example, if the wind is variable from 180 degrees to
   240 degrees at 10 knots, it would be encoded 21010KT 180V240.
   A4.5.4. Calm Wind. Calm wind is encoded as 00000KT.
A4.6. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance (at least 50% of the aerodrome) seen from
the airfield reported in statute miles. The most common visibility reported is 7 miles.
A4.7. Runway Visual Range.
A4.8. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon occurring on the airfield. This is mandatory
anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. Table A5.2, lists the present weather codes:

A4.9. Sky Condition and Cloud Height. Describes the amount of clouds present at the airfield
and the base of each cloud deck. They fall into the following categories:
   A4.9.1. CLR – Sky Clear.
   A4.9.2. FEW – 1/8 to 2/8 coverage.
   A4.9.3. SCT – Scattered; 3/8 to 4/8 coverage.
   A4.9.4. BKN – Broken; 5/8 to 7/8 coverage.
   A4.9.5. OVC – Overcast; 8/8 coverage.
   A4.9.6. VV – Vertical visibility; normally used during heavy fog, indicates how far up into
   the fog can be seen.
   A4.9.7. FEW000 – Surface-based obscuration.
   A4.9.8. Cloud Height. Three-digit number provides the height of the base of the cloud in
   hundreds of feet (e.g., 015 equals 1,500 feet). The CB and TCU descriptors may be
   appended to the cloud height to indicate the cloud is a cumulonimbus or towering cumulus.
