This publication implements Air Force Instruction (AFI) 63-114, Rapid Response Process and
AFI 99-103, Capabilities-based Test and Evaluation. This instruction specifies the procedure for
securing formal approval for a Wartime Materiel Support (WMS) request resulting in a Test
Acceleration or Test Surge. The response to the WMS request (if approved) is an acceleration of
the test process to allow for a much more rapid execution of a test project than would otherwise
be possible. Taskings associated with tests conducted under this instruction will receive an
urgency code as defined in AFFTCI 16-303, EAFB Program Priority Assignments. It applies to
all 412 TW units and detachments regardless of their operating location. Waivers for the
requirements in this instruction may only be granted by the 412 TW/CC. Ensure that all records
created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance
with Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition
Schedule (RDS). Air Force personnel must ensure any information/records to be provided
outside official DoD channels, including foreign nationals, must be released in accordance with
the provisions of AFI 35-102, Security and Policy Review Process, and have the approval of the
release authority. If a written request for DoD records has been made by any person,
organization, business, but not including a Federal Agency, that either states or implies the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), it must be processed by the local FOIA Requester Service
Center (412 CS/SCOK) in accordance with DoDR 5400.7_AFMAN 33-302.

1. General
     1.1. A Test Acceleration (TA) is defined as a new test project, in support of real-world or
     exercise wartime requirements, that has not yet entered the Program Introduction (PI) –
     Statement of Capability (SOC) process, and requires a quick reaction turnaround time from
     planning through execution. A Test Surge (TS) refers to the accelerated execution of an
     existing project in support of real-world or exercise wartime requirements. The process is
     divided into five phases: Notification, Planning, Provisioning, Execution, and Analysis &
     Reporting.
        1.1.1. Notification: Initial notification will usually come directly from a customer to the
        Test Execution Organization (TEO), usually a Combined Test Force (CTF). If a CTF
        gets the first notification, they should immediately notify OG/CC and advise their contact
        to make a formal request. Typically this notification should come from an appropriate
        level such as the Aeronautical Systems Wing CC or CL. If coming from a MAJCOM, it
        should be in support of an Urgent Operational Need or Joint Urgent Operational Need.
        The 412 OG/CC notifies the 412 TW/CC and Command Post. Command Post runs their
        recall notification checklist directing them to stand up the Crisis Action Team (CAT).
        Notifications during exercises (e.g. Operational Readiness Inspection) will typically
        come from the 412 TW/XP.
        1.1.2. Planning: The TEO Director of Projects is responsible for ensuring all of the
        remaining steps in this instruction are completed. The TEO Director of Projects shall
        work with the organization requesting the TA/TS to define specific test requirements and
        from these requirements identify specific resources required to accomplish the TA/TS.
        The TEO should keep detailed notes of all meetings, including the assignment and
        documentation of all action items. Follow-up meetings to status action items should be
        held regularly, as necessary, to keep the program moving at an accelerated pace. This
        may mean frequent meetings initially to resolve issues as they arise.
        1.1.3. Provisioning: The TEO Director of Projects shall coordinate with those
        organizations that own or are responsible for coordinating the allocation of resources in
        order to provision those assets necessary to execute the TA/TS. This will involve
        coordination with organizations such as Test Wing Scheduling (412 OG/DOO), the
        organization that owns the system under test, and any off-base organizations that may
        provide assets and/or range support. 412 OG shall prioritize the allocation of test assets
        owned and/or allocated by 412 TW so as to properly support the TA/TS as well as other
        412 TW test programs.
        1.1.4. Execution: The execution of the TA/TS will be similar to other projects but with
        the higher priority (Urgency Code) that is directed by the TA/TS designation letter
        approved by the 412 TW/CC. Any challenges regarding support of the accelerated
        project shall be brought to the attention of the 412 OG/CC as soon as they are identified.
        Daily status updates are required from the TEO throughout the TA/TS, with the primary
        recipients being the OG, the Command Post, the CAT, and the 412 TW/CC. If the same
        tasks are still being worked, a daily status message is still required, but a simple
        statement that there is no new information to report is adequate. Some projects also
        provide a separate daily status to test team members and to major organizations impacted
        by the Test Surge, but this is optional. The last daily status should declare the formal end
EDWARDSAFBI99-106 19 DECEMBER 2013                                                               3


     of the TA/TS and generally would follow the delivery of the final product to the
     customer.
     1.1.5. Analysis and Reporting: The test plans and resources should be adjusted so that
     analysis and reporting are accomplished concurrent with execution so that the timeline
     for reporting will be short enough to meet the customer needs.. The report format and
     content will be determined by the Report Integrated Product Team co-chaired by the CTF
     Director of Projects and designated functional engineering representative (within 412
     TENG or 412 EWG as appropriate). Level of analysis and the timeline for delivery must
     be negotiated with the customer as soon as practical in the project’s schedule.
  1.2. Approval Briefing: During the notification phase, the 412 TMG assigns a Program
  Manager (PM), if one has not already been assigned, who develops the TA/TS approval
  briefing. A suggested outline is contained in Attachment 2. The 412 TMG will recommend
  a TEO as part of the TA/TS approval briefing. The approval briefing, which includes a
  TA/TS letter to be signed by the 412 TW/CC, is assembled by the PM. The letter is
  generated by the 412 OG/CC in coordination with 412 TMG/CC and included in the briefing
  by the PM. An approval letter template is provided in Attachment 3.
     1.2.1. The approval briefing must include the information required to make an informed
     decision regarding the TA/TS designation and includes the following as a minimum:
     1.2.2. Information regarding the initial request such as who is requesting the
     acceleration, nature of the expected results, classification, and impact on the warfighter, if
     known.
     1.2.3. Scope of testing in terms of schedule, required resources, missions, any special
     instrumentation requirements, range requirements, aircraft modifications, etc.
     1.2.4. Impact of this test project on other test projects to the extent known.
     1.2.5. Impact to warfighter if the request is not approved, if known.
     1.2.6. Risk assessment for maintenance operations to include: available airframe(s),
     deviations needed from scheduled maintenance to meet schedule, special support or
     modifications required impact on maintenance manpower, etc.
  1.3. Concept of Operations.
     1.3.1. Quick Reaction Test Team (QRTT): When the TW/CC approves the TA/TS by
     signing the designation letter, the QRTT will be convened within 1 workday. The QRTT
     is chaired by the 412th Operations Group Commander or designated
     representative. The QRTT will be composed of the following key personnel, or their
     designated representatives: 412 TW/SET, 412 TENG, 412 EWG (If Appropriate), 412
     TMG, TEO, 412 MXG, 412 MXI/ENI, 412 MSG, 412 LGR, AFTC/PK & others as
     invited (e.g. 412 TW/FM, XP, 412 OG/OGV, etc.) NOTE: The QRTT may be tailored
     by the QRTT chairman based on the scope of testing and resources required to support
     the test acceleration/surge. Upon activation unit representatives will come prepared to
     address their ability to support the QRTT tasking.
         1.3.1.1. QRTT Specific Tasks:
            1.3.1.1.1. Brief the reason for the meeting.      See Attachment 4 for a suggested
 4                                               EDWARDSAFBI99-106 19 DECEMBER 2013


                meeting agenda.
                1.3.1.1.2. Designate the lead briefing organization (i.e. TEO, PM, etc.).
                1.3.1.1.3. Scope the general response requirements for a ground, flight test or
                analysis.
                1.3.1.1.4. Identify/notify     the    appropriate support            agencies
                        (within each organization) required to plan and execute the test effort.
                1.3.1.1.5. Action items assigned should be reviewed prior to closing the QRTT
                initial meeting.
                1.3.1.1.6. Determine the need and schedule for future QRTT meetings if required.
                In general, future meetings will be called and chaired by the TEO Director of
                Projects or PM assigned to the TA/TS. The PM will generally call a Core Team
                meeting at the TEO to develop detailed requirements.
     1.4. Test Execution Organization: The TEO will be the center of execution for the test effort
     to include future meetings, test and safety planning, reporting, etc. All standard processes to
     plan, report, and execute the test effort shall be followed but at a significant reduction in
     timelines enabled by the increased priority. The PM assigned to the TEO for the TA/TS will
     ensure that the daily status reports are generated and forwarded as described in 1.1.4. The
     PM will decide if a Theory of Constraints (TOC) network should be generated based on the
     anticipated length of the project and the benefit of the network in light of the enhanced
     priority.
2. Checklists. The TA/TS checklist is contained in Attachment 5. This checklist shall be used
by the PM to organize, document, and report progress.

             412 TW TEST ACCELERATION/SURGE (TA/TS) CHECKLIST

A5.1. This checklist applies to all 412 TW Test Acceleration (TA)/Test Surge (TS) activities,
both real-world and exercise. A Test Acceleration (TA) indicates a new test project, in support
of real-world or exercise wartime requirements, that has not yet entered the Program Introduction
(PI) – Statement of Capability (SOC) process, and requires a quick reaction turnaround time
from planning through execution. A Test Surge refers to the accelerated execution of an existing
project in support of real-world or exercise wartime requirements. This checklist will be used for
both the TA and TS. Applicability of each step is annotated.
A5.2. All applicable steps of this checklist need to be completed to make sure any changes
resulting from the test project’s accelerated status are considered. This checklist is divided into
five phases: Notification, Planning, Provisioning, Execution, and Analysis and Reporting.
A5.3. Phase 1. Notification
   A5.3.1. Initial notification will usually come directly from a customer to the TEO (CTF or
   Flight Test Squadron (FLTS)). If a CTF gets the first notification, they should immediately
   notify OG/CC and advise their contact to make a formal request. The organization or
   individual receiving initial notification must immediately consider the security classification
   of the proposed test.
   A5.3.2. If appropriate:
       A5.3.2.1. Use secure communications
       A5.3.2.2. Use secure meeting facilities
       A5.3.2.3. Verify security clearance of all participants.

Table A5.1. Notification
 STEP
 #        TASK                                                      APPLICABILITY   STATUS
 1        When initial notification is received contact the 412     TA/TS
          OG/CC, who then notifies 412 TW/CC and Command
          Post. Command Post runs their recall notification
          checklist directing them to stand up the CAT.

          When the CAT is formed, the 412 OG/CC is an               TA/TS
          advisory member and becomes the focal point for all
          TA/TS information requested by the CAT. The 412
          OG/CC provides briefings and updates to the CAT as
          requested.

          The 412 TMG appoints a PM.                                TA

          PM develops the Test Acceleration/Surge approval          TA/TS
          briefing (which is required in the next step) using the
          format in Attachment 2.

 2        The 412 TW/CC receives the TA/TS approval                TA/TS
          briefing from the PM and, if warranted, approves the
          TA/TS status in writing using the memo in Attachment
          3. This memo, generated by OG, directs all participating
          agencies to support and expedite project planning until
          the appropriate 412 TW priority is established.

          If the 412 TW/CC does not approve the TA/TS status,       TA/TS
          this checklist is complete and the project goes through
          normal 412 TW processes.

 3        For TA/TS, the 412 TMG designates the Test                TA
          Execution Organization (TEO), which is typically an
          existing Combined Test Force (CTF) at the 412 TW.
          The specific CTF designated as TEO depends on the
          system to be tested. If the test acceleration weapon
          system is not currently being tested at 412 TW, then
          the most appropriate CTF with similar type aircraft or
          systems would be designated the TEO.

 4        The 412 OG/CC provides the TEO Director (the              TA/TS
          CTF Director) with a copy of all available
          information concerning the TA/TS, to include the
          most current version of this checklist.

 5     The 412 OG/CC notifies the following base agencies, if    TA/TS
       appropriate, that a TA/TS is underway so that they should
       be prepared to support, as requested by the TEO.
       Consider use of secure communications and provide a
       copy of the signed 412 TW/CC memo from Step 2, if
       requested. These agencies are in addition to the normal
       CAT membership and can be invited to the CAT
       formation as applicable.

A5.4. Phase 2. Planning
   A5.4.1. The TEO Director of Projects is responsible for ensuring all of the remaining steps
   in this instruction are completed. The TEO Director of Projects shall work with the
   organization requesting the TA/TS to define specific test requirements and from these
   requirements identify specific resources required to accomplish the TA/TS. The TEO should
   keep detailed notes of all meetings, including the assignment and documentation of all action
   items. Follow-up meetings to status action items should be held regularly, as necessary, to
   keep the program moving at an accelerated pace. This may mean frequent meetings initially
   to resolve issues as they arise and to provide status updates to the OG.
   A5.4.2. It is a good idea for the test team to create their own recall/contact list for the
   duration of the TA/TS, to include work, home, and cell phone numbers, if necessary (mark
   FOUO and safeguard appropriately). Besides test team members, names on this list might
   include customer contacts, as well as other key organizations.
   A5.4.3. Daily status updates are required from the TEO throughout the TA/TS, with the
   primary recipients being the OG, the Command Post, the CAT, and the 412 TW/CC. If the
   same tasks are still being worked, a daily status message is still required, but a simple
   statement that there is no new information to report is adequate. Some projects also provide
   a separate daily status to test team members and to major organizations impacted by the
   TA/TS, but this is optional.
