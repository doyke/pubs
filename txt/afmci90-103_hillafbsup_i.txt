                                             Chapter 1

                                       GENERAL POLICY

1.1. Introduction. This instruction outlines the procedures to ensure accurate and timely
investigations, reviews, reports and briefings to the AFMC Command staff on significant
materiel losses and fatalities. Incident investigations and reviews must consistently identify all
factors (human, materiel, and environmental) that directly or indirectly contributed to the
incident to prevent reoccurrence. This instruction is neither comprehensive nor intended to
provide detailed investigative guidance as outlined in the AFIs and AFPAMs; its purpose is to
highlight areas that are essential to every investigation and those unique to AFMC. Mishaps and
accidents are analyzed via investigation, suicides by review.
1.2. Applicability. All organizations within AFMC must perform the following and report to
the AFMC Commander:
     1.2.1. Investigate Class A mishaps and accidents.
     1.2.2. Review suicides of an on/off-duty service member or on/off-duty DoD civilian.
1.3. Optional Investigations/Reviews and Special Considerations.
     1.3.1. Off-duty DoD civilian mishap death investigations are not normally conducted; they
     are neither directed by AFI nor are they prohibited. Commanders may investigate/review
     these deaths in extraordinary circumstances if they warrant sufficient interest or preventative
     lessons learned. See paragraph 1.3.4 for legal jurisdiction.
        1.3.1.1. Off-duty suicide reviews and mishap death investigations of DoD civilians
        should focus on duty-related conditions and precursors. Limit contacts to law
        enforcement agencies and base level sources, e.g., coworkers, the supervisory chain, and
        personal associates who voluntarily share information.
        1.3.1.2. Findings may be inconclusive in off-duty DoD civilian deaths as not all evidence
        such as medical records, access to the event site or sworn witness statements may be
        available. Investigators/reviewers must work closely with legal advisors to protect
        privacy and preclude litigation.
     1.3.2. Contractor mishap deaths are not reportable within the safety reporting requirements
     unless the death was in conjunction with a reportable mishap loss (e.g. the contractor died
     while inside an AFMC-owned aircraft that was destroyed). A separate contractor fatality
     report is not generated. See paragraph 1.3.4 for legal jurisdiction.
     1.3.3. Contractor suicides are not reviewed or reported under this or its parent instructions.
     1.3.4. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and/or local law enforcement
     authorities have jurisdiction in certain fatality investigations. OSHA will investigate all
     contractor and on-duty DoD civilian fatalities. Local law enforcement authorities also have
     priority over AF investigators in contractor fatality investigations and in DoD civilian
     fatalities when off-duty or outside of Federal property. AF investigators may work in
     parallel with these agencies, and petition them for data. Agreement of all parties is essential
     prior to the investigation as associated parties cannot be compelled to participate.
AFMCI90-103_HILLAFBSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                    5


  1.3.5. Notify the AFOSI of all deaths; military, DoD civilian, non-DoD civilian on Federal
  property and contractor. For mishap investigations, immediately notify the AFOSI if
  criminal activity/sabotage is suspected. See AFI 71-101, Criminal Investigations, for details
  and a listing of required AFOSI initiated investigations.
     1.3.5.1. If initiated, AFOSI investigations take precedence over investigations/reviews
     until criminal activity, natural causes and suicide have been ruled out as possible causes
     of damage, injury or death.
     1.3.5.2. Other investigations/reviews may work in parallel with the AFOSI during their
     initial fact finding and assessment of the event. To prevent improper influence, AFOSI
     Commanders and agents do not report to the AFMC chain of command.
  1.3.6. Mishaps and events (Class B and below) not specified in 1.2.1 or 1.2.2 are convened
  and investigated by the AFMC Centers.
  1.3.7. Most incidents addressed in this instruction are also reported through Command post
  channels. See AFI 10-206 for OPREP-3 reporting requirements.
  1.3.8. The Union shall be permitted, at its request, to meet with safety and/or management
  officials when conducting an industrial mishap investigation involving a bargaining unit
  employee.

                                             Chapter 2

                            MISHAP (SAFETY) INVESTIGATIONS

2.1. Overview. AFMC/CC is the convening authority and HQ AFMC/SE is the OPR for Class
A mishap investigations governed by the 91-series of instructions and pamphlets. The sole
purpose of safety investigations is to identify causal factors for preventative purposes, not to
assign liability or blame.
2.2. Readiness and Training.
     2.2.1. AFMC continually needs Board Presidents (BP) to lead Class A investigations; rated,
     non-rated and civilian personnel are needed.
     2.2.2. Trained BPs may serve on either Safety Investigation Boards (SIB) or Accident
     Investigation Boards (AIB).
     2.2.3. HQ AFMC/SE is responsible for obtaining training slots from the Air Force Safety
     Center and then allocating slots to the Centers to maintain a cadre of BPs.
     2.2.4. AFMC Centers will forecast needed BP training based on PCS, retirement and mission
     area. Send candidates to training and report the status to HQ AFMC/SE on a semiannual
     basis IAW AFMC Sup to AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports.
     2.2.5. To ensure readiness and alleviate repeat tasking, Centers will be grouped into
     rotational ―buckets‖ responsible for providing BPs as needed. SIB members will be selected
     from the buckets to the maximum extent possible; however, special needs or AFMC/CC
     preference may dictate BP selection. See Attachment 2, Board President Distribution, for
     rank, quantity and rotational grouping requirements.
2.3. Board Presidents.
     2.3.1. Aviation Board Presidents. For events involving aircrew, the BP must be a graduate
     of the HQ AFSC Board President Course (BPC) and be a pilot or a navigator unless mishap
     circumstances clearly indicate the aircrew was not a factor. For all aircraft mishaps not
     involving a fatality, the BP must be a Colonel or higher. For aircraft flight mishaps involving
     a fatality, CSAF requires the BP to be a Brigadier General select or higher rank. The BP
     must be appointed from outside the wing (or equivalent organization) experiencing the
     mishap. Exceptions: UAV Class A mishaps may utilize a Lieutenant Colonel as the BP and
     BPC attendance is desired, not mandatory.
     2.3.2. Weapons Board Presidents. BPs will be a Colonel or above, a graduate of the BPC
     and from outside of the mishap wing/equivalent whenever possible.
     2.3.3. Ground Board Presidents. BPs will be a Colonel or GS-15. The BP will be a graduate
     of the BPC, the Mishap Investigation for Non-Aviation (MINA) Course, Aircraft Mishap
     Investigation Course (AMIC), or the Jet Engine Mishap Investigation Course (JEMIC).
2.4. Board President Appointment. When a Class A mishap occurs for which AFMC/CC is
the convening authority, HQ AFMC/SE will call Centers on tap within the rotational bucket for
nominations to the SIB on behalf of the AFMC/CC.
AFMCI90-103_HILLAFBSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                       7


   2.4.1. Upon notification, Centers will have six duty hours, or 24 non-duty hours to submit
   names for each nomination. Duty hours for this purpose will be 0700-1700L, Monday
   through Friday. Before submitting names to HQ AFMC/SE, Centers must verify the
   availability of nominees with their respective Commanders.
   2.4.2. HQ AFMC/SE will forward an Item of Interest (IOI) mishap message to the AFMC
   Command staff. This message will identify potential SIB and AIB BPs from the current
   rotational bucket, along with BP recommendations based on experience, currency of training
   and availability. AFMC/CC or CV appoints the BPs from this list or may appoint from all
   available candidates. HQ AFMC/SE then drafts appointment orders to the SIB and notifies
   the respective Center CC and SE.
       2.4.2.1. HQ AFMC/SE will immediately notify HQ AFMC/JA of the mishap and
       identify potential BPs. When possible, the board presidents for both the SIB and the AIB
       shall be appointed concurrently. Per AFI 91-204, SIBs have priority and hence first
       selection of potential BPs.
   2.4.3. Board presidents report directly to AFMC/CC during the period of their investigation,
   and this duty takes precedence over all others until the investigation is complete. BPs will
   provide weekly status reports to the AFMC/CC. HQ AFMC/SE may assist BPs with
   coordination to AFMC/CC.
   2.4.4. The convening authority determines the size and composition of the SIB based on the
   type and complexity of the mishap. Generally, full boards are used for loss of life and/or
   aircraft – consult AFI 91-204 and the discipline specific AFMAN 91-xxx Chapter 5 for
   detailed guidance.
2.5. Investigative Process. Investigations begin with the formation of the Interim Safety Board
(ISB) and end when all validated SIB recommendations are closed. To ensure that root causes
are adequately identified and corrected, investigators must consult both AFI 91-204, Safety
Investigations and Reports, for detailed procedures and prohibitions and AFPAM 91-211, USAF
Guide to Aviation Safety Investigations. This pamphlet serves as a ready reference for all
assigned board members to refresh their memories on specific duties, offers a generic strategy to
accomplish them, and is suitable for all mishap investigations.
   2.5.1. ISBs are convened by the Commander of the nearest active duty Air Force
   installation, and typically mirror the permanent SIB in composition. ISBs must form as soon
   as possible after any mishap, as evidence such as toxicology testing is fleeting. If the mishap
   site is controlled by an on-scene Incident Commander (IC), the ISB must coordinate for
   access and will receive custody of wreckage and evidence as safety permits. The IC’s duties
   typically end when site hazards are mitigated and emergency response actions are completed
   – see AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management Program Planning and Operations,
   for details.
       2.5.1.1. The sole functions of the ISB are preservation of evidence, identification of
       witnesses, conducting interviews, and the gathering of factual data. The ISB president is
       responsible for the transfer of this information to the SIB president after arrival at the
       mishap location.
   2.5.2. The SIB president will assume control of all investigative responsibilities, evidence
   and wreckage after a positive hand-off of evidence from the ISB president. At this point the
 8                                     AFMCI90-103_HILLAFBSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010


     ISB is excluded from all further deliberative processes. The SIB’s sole responsibility is to
     investigate the mishap, and clearly identify causal factors and recommendations for briefing
     to the AFMC/CC and subsequent mishap report release to the Air Force at large. Board
     members are relieved of all other duties until released by the convening authority.
     2.5.3. Once findings and causes are established, use careful deliberation to assign obtainable
     and effective recommendations as well as the proper office of primary responsibility (OPR)
     for corrective actions. The OPR is typically the lead Command that has both operational
     and/or fiscal control. The office of collateral responsibility (OCR) is typically the agency
     that will facilitate or perform the action. Example: The SIB determines that all F-16
     canopies should be made of kryptonite to prevent bird strike penetration. The OPR would be
     ACC/A4 as the agency obligating the finances to make the change and accepting the risk not
     to. OO-ALC would be the OCR as the agency performing the work and providing the
     technical guidance. SIBs should contact the OPR/OCR prior to publishing the report to
     validate assignment.
     2.5.4. Safety investigations take precedence over accident investigations. However, if an
     AIB is convened, SIBs should begin the transfer of non-privileged evidence and factual
     material to the AIB as soon as possible (while the investigation is still in progress). See AFI
     91-204, chapter 5 for prohibitions and a list of evidence to transfer.
2.6. Timeline for Reporting. Investigations should be completed within 30 days, and briefing
to AFMC/CC within 45 days of the mishap as timely release of the mishap report is essential for
prevention efforts. However, accuracy and detail take priority over the timeline. HQ AFMC/SE
will coordinate requests for extension through the AFMC/CC and the Air Force Safety Center.
See AFI 91-204, Table 6.2., Reporting Schedule, for detailed requirements and exceptions.
2.7. Funding. The Commander of the Air Force installation hosting the SIB funds all in-house
support. TDY travel orders and funding are initially the responsibility of the AFMC SIB
member’s parent unit. HQ AFMC/SE may fund TDY travel of SIB members if funds are
available.
     2.7.1. Place ―ESP CODE: SI‖ at the end of the unit’s fund site and in Defense Travel Service
     (DTS) lines of accounting (LOA) to identify expenditures on all safety investigation related
     TDY orders and funding, to include technical assistance.              Units should request
     reimbursement from their local FM who will in turn petition HQ AFMC/FM. HQ
     AFMC/FM will approve reimbursement if funds are deemed available during the fiscal year
     budgetary process.
     2.7.2. SIBs contact HQ AFMC/SE to coordinate funding for extraordinary needs such as
     special equipment, vehicles or laboratory analysis required for investigations.
2.8. Reporting Requirements. Class A SIB reports are comprised of a briefing to the
AFMC/CC, final electronic message, and the unabridged formal report. All must clearly outline
causal findings, recommendations to prevent re-occurrence, and agencies responsible for
corrective action (OPR/OCR).
     2.8.1. Once the investigation is complete, BPs contact HQ AFMC/SE to schedule the
     briefing. The purpose of the SIB brief to the convening authority is to inform the CC and
     gain concurrence and to validate the board’s findings and conclusions. AFMC/CC may
     accept the findings of the SIB or direct further investigation. This briefing is not for general
AFMCI90-103_HILLAFBSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                      9


   release to the AFMC populace – the approved mishap messages will target the appropriate
   safety communities. If the mishap involved a fatality, an additional briefing by the mishap
   Squadron/equivalent Commander to the AFMC Council is required – see Chapter 5.
       2.8.1.1. Use     the    following      link    for   the     briefing     slide  template,
       https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-SE-
       MC-01-55-1&Filter=OO-SE-MC-01, or consult the HQ AFMC/SE web page.
       Construct the briefing using a single-screen format of slides to allow for VTC broadcast.
       2.8.1.2. BPs may, with AFMC/CC approval, present an INFORMATION ONLY
       briefing to the mishap Center and Wing/equivalent Commanders/Directors prior to the
       AFMC/CC briefing. This briefing, investigation and all findings/recommendations are
       owned by the AFMC/CC; any attempt to influence or censor this material or the SIB is
       expressly prohibited.
       2.8.1.3. Attendance at the AFMC/CC briefing is typically limited to the mishap Center
       and Wing/ equivalent Commanders/Directors, applicable HQ 2-letters and technical
       experts as required and invited by HQ AFMC/SE. All others contact HQ AFMC/SE for
       attendance approval. If the mishap Center and Wing/equivalent Commanders/Director
       are unable to attend, coordinate with HQ AFMC/SE for VTC attendance only approval.
       2.8.1.4. SIBs will arrive 2 days prior to the AFMC/CC briefing so that HQ AFMC/SE
       can review the briefing and assist with any last minute formatting. Briefings are scripted
       and should be concise (20-40 minutes target), but must answer the essential questions:
       Why did this happen?, How can we prevent it? and, Who is responsible for the corrective
       action?
       2.8.1.5. The BP or Single Investigating Officer (SIO) will brief. SIB military members
       will wear service dress and civilians will wear business attire.
   2.8.2. To expedite the report release and mitigate the possibility of data loss, SIBs should
   begin building the formal report on CD and entering the final message report information
   into Air Force Safety Automated System (AFSAS) as the investigation progresses.
       2.8.2.1. Bring copies of both the final message and the formal report to HQ AFMC/SE 2
       days prior to the briefing. The AFMC/CC will receive a read ahead copy of the proposed
       final message 1 day prior to the briefing.
       2.8.2.2. Once AFMC/CC accepts the results of the investigation, he will authorize the
       release of the final message and report. Generally, HQ AFMC/SE will verbally request
       the release of the messages at the end of the briefing. The formal report must be released
       within 3 days of the briefing; HQ AFMC/SE will assist with the copying and distribution
       of the report CDs. Typically, board member duties end after publishing the final report.
2.9. Disposition of Evidence. The ISB/SIB will generally maintain control of evidence or
wreckage, unless this evidence must be removed in the interest of safety (hazardous material) or
to make way for vital civil/operational functions (removal from an active runway). Thoroughly
document the evidence via photograph/video if time permits.
   2.9.1. If evidence must be moved prior to the arrival of the ISB or SIB/IO, the on-scene
   Incident Commander (IC) will coordinate with the Installation Commander and Chief of
   Safety. Coordinate with the local environmental management office to ensure all Federal and
10                                 AFMCI90-103_HILLAFBSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010


  State laws are complied with for proper handling, storage, and disposal of contaminated
  evidence. The host Installation Commander is responsible for removing and storing
  wreckage.
  2.9.2. To ensure that all evidence impounded by the SIB or AIB is not prematurely lost,
  wreckage and ancillary evidence will normally be maintained for a period of at least 30 days
  following the completion of all investigations (comply with additional AFI 51-series
  restrictions). At the end of the investigation, custody of the wreckage will be maintained by
  the Installation Commander; coordinate with the convening authority’s SE and Staff Judge
  Advocate (SJA) for disposition of all evidence. However, if an AIB is convened, the SIB
  president or the IO will turn wreckage and other non-privileged evidence over to the AIB
  president. At the conclusion of the AIB, the AIB president will coordinate with the
  convening authority’s SJA and SE for disposition of wreckage and other ancillary evidence.
  See AFI 51-503, AFI 51-507 and AFI 91-204 for specific guidance regarding chain of
  custody and final release from legal hold.
     2.9.2.1. Wreckage Custody Flow: IC – ISB – SIB – AIB – Installation CC – (SJA / SE

                                           Chapter 3

                         ACCIDENT (LEGAL) INVESTIGATIONS

3.1. Overview. Accident Investigation Boards are convened under AFI 51-503 (for aerospace
mishaps) and AFI 51-507 (for ground mishaps). The convening authority for Accident
Investigation Boards and Ground Accident Investigation Boards is AFMC/CV. AIBs are
conducted to inquire into the facts surrounding Air Force accidents, to prepare a publicly
releasable report, and to gather and preserve evidence for use in litigation, claims, disciplinary
actions, administrative proceedings, and for other purposes.
3.2. Accidents Requiring Investigation. Duty-related mishaps resulting in a fatality,
destruction of an Air Force aircraft, or high-dollar property damage meeting Class A cost
thresholds generally require convening of an AIB. AIBs are not mandatory for destroyed
remotely piloted subscale aircraft and aerial targets. If only government property is damaged,
then convening an AIB is discretionary. Further details can be found at AFI 51-503, Chapter 1,
and AFI 51-507, Chapter 1. When an AIB is not conducted, other investigations, including
Commander-directed investigations, should be considered.
3.3. Board Presidents.
   3.3.1. Board Presidents for aerospace mishaps must be graduates of the HQ AFSC Board
   Presidents Course, generally must be either a pilot or navigator, and must not be assigned to
   the mishap wing/equivalent. Board Presidents for ground mishaps need not be a pilot or
   navigator, are not required to have attended the AFSC Board Presidents Course (although
   such attendance is preferable), and must not be assigned to the mishap squadron/equivalent
   or group. Board President requirements for weapons mishaps are dependent on the nature of
   the mishap – contact HQ AFMC/JA for guidance. AIB Board Presidents are usually the
   same rank as the corresponding Safety Investigation Board President. Further details can be
   found at AFI 51-503, Chapter 4, and AFI 51-507, Chapter 4.
   3.3.2. HQ AFMC/SE will maintain a list of potential Board Presidents who have graduated
   from the HQ AFSC Board Presidents Course. When possible, the Board Presidents for both
   the SIB and AIB shall be appointed concurrently. HQ AFMC/JA shall obtain nominees from
   each Center, as appropriate, and shall coordinate this process through the Center Executive
   Officers. HQ AFMC/JA will then draft the convening order for AFMC/CV’s signature.
3.4. Investigative Process. After completion of the Safety Investigation Board, the SIB
President provides the AIB a copy of the unprivileged portion of the SIB report (usually
contained in Part I), any relevant evidence, and a list of the witnesses interviewed by the SIB.
The AIB will obtain and evaluate any pertinent evidence and interview any necessary witnesses
in order to develop a thorough factual background of all the circumstances surrounding the
mishap. A report is then prepared in accordance with the guidelines contained in AFI 51-503,
Chapters 5, 6, and 8, and AFI 51-507, Chapters 5-7.
3.5. Timeline for Investigation. After the handoff from the SIB takes place, aerospace AIBs
should be completed within 30 days and ground AIBs should be completed within 45 days.
3.6. Funding. IAW AFI 51-503, the AIB convening authority is responsible for funding costs
associated with accident investigations. TDYs for AIB members may be initially funded by the
 12                                   AFMCI90-103_HILLAFBSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010


unit to which each member is assigned. In such cases, the unit utilizes its local fund citation and
includes in that citation and in the DTS LOA ―ESP Code: EM.‖ This code identifies the
expenditure as related to an accident investigation and constitutes a request for reimbursement
from HQ AFMC. HQ AFMC/FM will approve reimbursement if funds are available during the
fiscal year budgetary process.
3.7. Reporting Requirements. Upon completion, the AIB report is forwarded to HQ
AFMC/JA. HQ AFMC/JA makes necessary notifications to AFLOA/JACT and SAF/PA. After
coordination with appropriate HQ AFMC directorates, HQ AFMC/JA forwards the AIB report to
AFMC/CV or AFMC/CC for review and approval. If the convening authority so requests, a
formal briefing will be provided by the AIB board president. Subsequent to approval of the AIB
report, HQ AFMC/JA distributes copies of the report to AFLOA/JACT, AFSC/JA, and the
military units associated with the mishap.
3.8. Disposition of Evidence. Generally, the mishap wreckage is safeguarded and maintained
in a legal hold status until such status is lifted by AFLOA/JACT. One exception to this rule is in
the case of abbreviated aerospace AIBs. For those types of AIBs, HQ AFMC/JA may release
wreckage from legal hold. Further details can be found at AFI 51-503, paragraph 10.7, and AFI
51-507, paragraph 10.4.
AFMCI90-103_HILLAFBSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                      13


                                           Chapter 4

                                     SUICIDE REVIEWS

4.1. Overview. Suicide reviews must be conducted and lessons learned quickly distributed to
the field with the greatest dissemination possible. Lessons learned in the aftermath of a suicide
provide insight that may prevent future loss of life. Prevention is the primary goal. When an
active duty or DoD civilian member assigned to AFMC commits suicide, HQ AFMC will direct
a review of the suicide that focuses on the deceased individual in terms of discernable
information about their personal wellness, specifically addressing the social, physical, emotional
and spiritual dimensions of their life. A review of the deceased individual’s work environment,
relationship with peers and superiors and what was known about the wingman culture of the
affected unit must also be considered.
4.2. Incidents Requiring Review. When Commanders/Directors experience a suicide in their
unit, they will provide a preliminary report to HQ AFMC/SGPW by completing the AFMC
Squadron/equivalent Commander/Director Suicide Event Worksheet (Attachment 3) within 5
working days, followed by a comprehensive review that will be routed to HQ AFMC/SG through
their Wing/equivalent and Center Commanders/Directors. As DoD civilian suicides can present
unique challenges, the post suicide event checklist (Attachment 4) is provided to ensure that
essential areas are addressed.
4.3. Suicide Review Training. HQ AFMC/SGPW will provide initial training and continue to
provide assistance throughout the process to personnel appointed to conduct suicide reviews.
4.4. Review     Process. Center/equivalent        Commanders/Directors       will    appoint     a
Squadron/equivalent Commander/Director to initiate a review of the suicide as soon as possible.
Available information should be considered with an eye towards any systemic causes within
human control that can be changed to prevent future incidents. When conducting the review,
AFOSI, JA, and SG consultation must occur in order to construct an accurate picture of what was
happening in the member’s life, and what might have contributed to the suicide. Information
should be developed from the facts available. Because of time constraints, AFOSI probably will
not have a final report available, so preliminary findings will suffice for the purpose of the
report. Do not speculate. If facts are not sufficient to answer a question, then document it as
such. If facts emerge later that alter the initial conclusions, a follow-up report is appropriate.
The Commander/Director will provide periodic updates to HQ AFMC/SGPW until the review is
completed.
   4.4.1. HQ AFMC/SG will notify AFOSI Region 1 to pre-coordinate the matter with the
   affected AFOSI field detachment. This will provide an opportunity to reemphasize agency
   roles/needs and identify any AFOSI investigative concerns that would impede or delay the
   suicide review process.
4.5. Reporting Requirements. The 4 Dimensions of Wellness Suicide Review Template can
be found at https://kx.afms.mil/afmcsgpw. It provides guidance and structure for all reporting
requirements of the investigation. The report will include an overview, the deceased’s personal
background, a sequence of events, areas of review (e.g., 72 hour history, 4 Dimensions of
Wellness, wingman culture), post-suicide actions, findings, causes and recommendations.
Reports should be concise and answer the essential questions: Why did this happen?, Where
 14                                  AFMCI90-103_HILLAFBSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010


were the opportunities, if any, to prevent it?, and Who is responsible for identified corrective
actions? The completed suicide event report should be forwarded to HQ AFMC/SGPW within
45 days of the suicide event. After review and approval by HQ AFMC/SG, the effected
Commander/Director will provide a fatality briefing to the AFMC Council by video
teleconference within 60 days of the event – see Chapter 5.
AFMCI90-103_HILLAFBSUP_I 19 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     15


                                           Chapter 5

                                  FATALITY BRIEFINGS

5.1. Overview. All mishap fatalities and suicides specified in 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 will be briefed to
the AFMC Council. The Commander’s goal is to get the word out beyond HQ AFMC/SG’s
internal review of the suicide event report and the limited audience that attended the CC’s
mishap out brief to take lessons learned from these unfortunate incidents. Squadron/equivalent
Commanders/Directors and higher, chiefs of safety, Command Chiefs and First Sergeants across
the Command should attend. The objective of this briefing is dissemination of information –
identifying, understanding and preventing the mishap environment.
5.2. Procedures. Following the SIB/AIB investigation, the mishap squadron/equivalent
Commander/Director will brief the details of the event at the soonest available AFMC Council
meeting. If an AIB is conducted, a fatality briefing should not ordinarily be given prior to the
AIB’s next of kin briefing. Commanders/Directors are encouraged to brief in person, but may
report via VTC with prior coordination. Military briefers will wear service dress and DoD
civilians will wear business formal attire. HQ AFMC/SE is the POC for mishap fatality
briefings; HQ AFMC/SG for suicide briefings.
5.3. Content. Briefings may contain safety privileged information but will be scrubbed to
remove Privacy Act (e.g. SSAN) information or other sensitive government issues to prevent
unauthorized release. If safety privileged information will be presented, the briefer must ask
unauthorized personnel to leave and then provide a safety privilege briefing prior to sharing
protected information. Authorized personnel are those listed in 5.1 and other Air Force officials
when their duties include mishap prevention and when it is necessary to develop, take, or review
preventive actions. Briefings containing safety privileged information are not releasable beyond
the preparing safety and Command staffs; ―read-aheads‖ are prohibited. Use the briefing slide
template                                          link                                         at
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-SE-MC-
01-55-1&Filter=OO-SE-MC-01 for mishap fatalities or the link at 4.5 of this instruction for
suicide reviews.
5.4. Distribution. Following the AFMC Council briefing, the ―lessons learned‖ portion of the
briefing will be prepared for AFMC/CV distribution to all Center Commanders/Directors for
prevention efforts and briefings. This release is to the widest audience possible without the
content of sensitive or privileged information. HQ AFMC/SE and SG are responsible for
staffing and distributing their respective messages to the Centers. Distribution of the entire
presentation or slides is not authorized.

                                           Chapter 6

                                        NEAR MISSES

6.1. Overview. The vast majority of events do not result in a Class A mishap or a suicide.
These ―near misses‖ represent the Class B, C, D and E mishaps and attempted suicides not
investigated or reported with the same enterprise as the events previously outlined in this
instruction. Analysis and communication of these events is essential to identify and correct the
causal factors and environments of minor incidents before they become major ones.
6.2. Metrics Analysis. HQ AFMC/SE will query the AFSAS mishap database to assess and
summarize events for Command-wide trend analysis. These summaries should provide essential
information so that Airmen, supervisors and Commanders will know where to focus preventive
efforts (e.g., 31% of FY08 Class C mishap injuries were due to slips, trips and falls; 15% due to
snow/ice on sidewalks and parking lots). This example shows how snow removal and delayed
duty reporting are valid mitigators to protect an aging, DoD civilian workforce. HQ AFMC/SG
will obtain and compile attempted suicide data for climate analysis of health and wellness.
6.3. Suicide Attempts. In the event of a suicide attempt by an active duty member, a Command
post notification will occur, but no worksheet is required. Instead, Mental Health Flight
personnel at the base level will ensure an entry into the Department of Defense Suicide Event
Record (DoDSER) is accomplished and provide a courtesy copy to HQ AFMC/SGPW. The
individual’s squadron/equivalent Commander/Director will conduct an internal review to
determine the nature of the event. The template for completed suicide reviews will be used for
all suicide attempts; however, the Center/Wing/ equivalent Commander/Director comments slide
is not required. Installation subject matter experts from Mental Health can provide guidance and
consultation. HQ AFMC/SGPW is an additional resource, especially when there is uncertainty
regarding the need for conducting the internal review. HQ AFMC/SGPW consultation should be
sought in instances where intent and/or lethality were questionable. Upon review completion,
the squadron/equivalent Commander/Director will share lessons learned with installation
leadership and provide HQ AFMC/SGPW information copy of their findings.                      The
Center/Wing/equivalent Commander/Director will determine who attends the briefing.
Identifying personal information will not be shared; only pertinent details that help prevent
future events.
   6.3.1. Suicide attempts by on-duty DoD civilians are not entered into the DoDSER, but the
   individual’s squadron/equivalent Commander/Director will conduct the internal review to
   determine if work-related precursors or environmental factors were present. See paragraph
   1.3.1 of this instruction for restrictions and special considerations.
6.4. Command Review. Commanders/Directors and personnel at all levels must be informed of
trends and hazards. HQ AFMC/SE and SG will analyze Center data, and at least once annually
will brief the AFMC Council on relevant issues (see Chapter 5 for content editing and
guidance). This briefing will provide Commanders/Directors and decision makers with an
essential part of the information needed to analyze the risks, and then make informed decisions
regarding the health and wellness of their areas of responsibility.

Terms
Accident Investigation Board (AIB)—A legal board convened for purposes other than mishap
prevention. Evidence obtained during an AIB is not privileged and can be used for various
purposes, including media release, claims, and disciplinary actions.
Class A Mishap*—An unplanned event resulting in loss or damage to material > $1M, a
manned aircraft, or death / permanent total disability of a military member or on-duty civilian.
Class B Mishap*—Loss or damage of $200K < $1M, a permanent partial disability, or
hospitalization of three or more personnel.
Class C Mishap*—Mishap costs of $20K < $200K, injury resulting in permanent change of job,
or loss of one + work days.
Class D Mishap*—Mishap resulting in an injury needing greater than first aid, loss of
consciousness, loss of a partial work day or restricted work / transfer to another job.
Class E Mishap*—Mishap costs of $2K < $20K or events deemed worthy of
investigation/reporting such as bird strikes (BASH), High Accident Potential (HAP) or
Hazardous Air Traffic Reports (HATR).*Definitions are not all-inclusive and dollar thresholds
are subject to revision. Consult AFI 91-204.
Four Dimensions of Wellness (4DW)—To attain and maintain harmony and balance in life, one
must pay attention to each of the four dimensions of wellness: Spiritual, Physical, Emotional and
Social. Neglecting or over-emphasizing any of the four dimensions will result in an out-of-
balance condition.
Incident—Event resulting in a safety or legal board investigation, suicide review or near miss
analysis.
Interim Safety Board (ISB)—A board formed immediately after the mishap to collect facts and
preserve evidence until arrival of the SIB.
Near Miss—An event analyzed for prevention that did not result in a Class A mishap or suicide.
Near misses include Class B, C, D, E mishap events and suicide attempts (defined as self-
injurious acts that do not cause death).
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)—Federal agency with authority to
investigate mishaps, inspect and issue citations for non-compliance with Federal safety and
health standards. OSHA will be notified and will investigate on-duty civilian and contractor

A4.4.a. Active Duty Military Suicide (on and off base) - Commander/Director Guidance

      Contact local law enforcement, AFOSI (777-1852), and 911 (Situation dependent). OSI Duty Agent
1     can be contacted after hours through the law enforcement desk or Command Post 777-3007.
      Notify Command Post (777-3007) and Chain of Command. 309 MXW will contact 309 WOC 777-
      3238. Command Post will initiate Operational Reporting (OPREP) messages. (Command Post will
2     notify FSS/CL and Mortuary Affairs.)

      Consult with Mental Health Flight (777-7909) or Mental Health on-call provider for assistance with
      immediate response planning and activating the Traumatic Stress Response Team. Command Post
3     can assist with contacting on-call provider after duty hours.
      Validate with JA (777-4886) and OSI (777-1852) who has jurisdiction of the scene and medical
      investigation. Normally, local coroners have medical incident authority in these cases but some
4     locations may vary.
      Notify Casualty Assistance Representative (CAR) (801-940-7741) to notify Next of Kin (NOK)
      IAW AFI 36-3002 and receive briefing on managing casualty affairs. Wing Commander or office
5     designee makes notification if NOK is in local area. CAR can assist.

      Consult with Traumatic Stress Response Team Chief (777-7909) or on-call mental health provider to
      prepare announcement to unit and to co-workers. Describe death as a suicide or completed suicide.
      There is no ―success‖ in a completed suicide. Make initial announcement to work site followed by
6     e-mail to community affected.
      Make initial announcement to work site. Have Traumatic Stress Response team present for support
7     to distraught personnel.
      Avoid announcing specific details of the suicide. Merely state it was a suicide. Do not mention
      method used. Location is announced as either on-base or off-base. Do not announce specific
8     location.
      Avoid memorializing / idealizing deceased or conveying the suicide is different from any other
9     death.

   When engaging in public discussions of the suicide, 1) express sadness at the Air Force’s loss and
   the grief of the survivors; 2) emphasize untreated depression is the number one cause of suicide, 3)
   remind listeners of the unnecessary nature of suicide because there are alternatives, 4) that Air Force
   wants personnel to seek assistance when distressed, 5) that support services are available, 6)
   everyone should be a Wingman, assist personnel in distress and connect them with resources, and 7)
10 provide brief reminder of warning signs for suicide.

   Consider increasing senior leadership presence in the work area immediately following
   announcement of death. Engage informally with personnel and communicate message of support
11 and information in previous item. Presence initially should be fairly intensive and then faded.

   Consult with Chaplain (777-2106) regarding Memorial Services. Memorial services should avoid
   idealizing / eulogizing deceased – Goals: 1) Comfort the grieving, 2) Help survivors deal with their
   guilt, 3) Help survivors face their anger, 4) Attack stigma, 5) Prevent imitation and modeling.
   Consider the option of not having a memorial service so as not to give unintended adulation to the
12 event and thereby trigger possible ―copy cat‖ events among other unidentified, unstable individuals.
13 Avoid public memorials -- no plaques, trees, or other reminders of decedent’s suicide.

   Utilize or refer grieving co-workers and family members to Integrated Delivery System (IDS)
   resources (Mental Health: 777-7909; Wingman Advocates: 777-2255; Chaplain: 777-2106; EAP:

   Please Note: Service members’ medical records may be reviewed and pertinent material may be
   used in the Suicide Review. Federal and local laws prevent base personnel from obtaining sensitive
   personal information on civilian employees. Therefore post suicide review of DoD civilian
   employees can be limited. AFMCI 90-103 Chapter 4 provides specific information on how to
24 accomplish a suicide review.
   Interview immediate supervisor, coworkers, chain of command to include senior leadership using
   the risk factors outlined in the suicide review briefing template as described in AFMCI 90-103,
   Chapter 4. Risk factors can be formatted using the 4 Dimension of Wellness Model—were there any
   emotional, physical, social, and/or spiritual factors that may have contributed to the suicide event?
25 Coordinate and/or deconflict planned interviews with OSI.
   IAW AFMCI 90-103, do not interview family members as a component of the death review. If
   family members spontaneously provide information during supportive contacts or reach out to the
   unit wanting to discuss the death of the family member, it may be used in the suicide review, if
   relevant. This is a very delicate conversation. Family members should not be interrogated as in an
   investigation, but information provided at family member request can be used in the review.
26 Consider the 4 Dimensions of Wellness when engaging in such conversations.
     AFMC UNITS ONLY

      Supervisor notifies Chain of Command. Commander / director contacts Command Post and ensures
      OPREP is sent to AFMC. 309 MXW will contact 309 WOC 777-3238. (Command Post will notify
2     Civilian Personnel, FSS/CL and Mortuary Affairs.)

      equivalent makes in-person notification, as required. Notification should be made with employee's
5     supervisor or others; as directed by commander / director. CAR can assist.

      Validate with JA (777-4886) and OSI (777-1852) who has jurisdiction of the scene and medical
      investigation. Normally, local coroners have medical incident authority in these cases but some
6     locations may vary.

   Please Note: Service members’ medical records may be reviewed and pertinent material may be
   used in the Suicide Review. Federal and local laws prevent base personnel from obtaining sensitive
   personal information on civilian employees. Therefore post suicide review of DoD civilian
   employees can be limited. AFMCI 90-103 Chapter 4 provides specific information on how to
25 accomplish a suicide review.
   Interview immediate supervisor, coworkers, chain of command to include senior leadership using
   the risk factors outlined in the suicide review briefing template as described in AFMCI 90-103,
   Chapter 4. Risk factors can be formatted using the 4 Dimension of Wellness Model—were there any
   emotional, physical, social, and/or spiritual factors that may have contributed to the suicide event?
26 Coordinate and/or deconflict planned interviews with OSI.
   IAW AFMCI 90-103, do not interview family members as a component of the death review. If
   family members spontaneously provide information during supportive contacts or reach out to the
   unit wanting to discuss the death of the family member, it may be used in the suicide review, if
   relevant. This is a very delicate conversation. Family members should not be interrogated as in an
   investigation, but information provided at family member request can be used in the review.
27 Consider the 4 Dimensions of Wellness when engaging in such conversations.
