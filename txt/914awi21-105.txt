     filed in the TODO TO library. A record copy will be provided to PS&D.
     1.4. The QA TCTO manager will generate a TCTO notification letter to PS&D and affected
     work centers stating that an applicable TCTO has been received. If a TCTO affects supply
     assets a supply notification letter will be provided to the Flight Service Center (FSC) for
     verification of affected assets. Upon receipt of the TCTO notification letter, PS&D will
     schedule a TCTO meeting with all affected work centers and supervision.

        request to PS&D to be placed in the TCTO folder.
        1.4.2. Notify PS&D once CPIN is received and TCTO is ready for accomplishment.
     1.5. The TODO will distribute a working copy of TCTOs to affected work centers in the

Supervisor TCTO Procedures:
     3.1. Schedule and chair the TCTO pre-planning meeting for aircraft, AGE, support
     equipment, life support, and commodity TCTOs (the UEM will handle all engine related

     parts/kits are required) and a technician from applicable back shops or work centers. Other
     shops may be requested when required.
        3.1.1. Coordinate with Operations on all CPIN changes prior to implementation changes.
     3.2. PS&D will load all TCTOs into the MIS G081. If a TCTO affects weight and balance

     When PS&D schedules the first TCTO, notify QA to perform an initial evaluation and load a
     WES against the main TCTO job, against the initial aircraft, within the MIS G081 for QA to
