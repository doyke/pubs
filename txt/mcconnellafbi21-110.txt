1. Responsibilities: Weight and balance procedures, if not followed correctly, may adversely
affect aircraft performance. Procedures outlined in the references of this instruction must be
strictly adhered to. Direct any questions to the weight and balance program managers,
MXG/DCM Quality Assurance (QA).
     1.1. 22 MXG QA Weight and Balance Program Manager (W&BPM) will:
        1.1.1. Maintain a current weight and balance letter to include the following information: Tail
        number, series design, basic weight, basic moment and last update. Ensure aircrews and
        wing planners have up-to-date information available for mission planning. This information
        is available on the McConnell website at: https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/22og/22og_ogv/
        default.aspx. Primary W&B manager or authorized representative will ensure a current copy
        of the Automated Weight and Balance Scheduler (AWBS) will be sent out monthly to 22 OG
        Standardization and Evaluation (OGV). https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/DocMan/
        DOCMain.asp?FolderID=AM-OP-01-34-12&Filter=AM-OP-01-34
        1.1.2. Weight and balance supplemental handbooks are maintained on the aircraft in the
        technical order cabinet located on the aft wall of the latrine. QA maintains the weight
        and balance primary handbook and historical records in the QA office.
     1.2. 22 OG/OGV will:
        1.2.1. Post and maintain copies of all locally developed standardized AF IMT 4100s on
        the 22 OGV website to ensure proper loading of aircraft.
        1.2.2. Provide Alternate Mission Equipment (AME) -21 and QA any changes to the
        standardized local aircraft configuration (i.e. Aero Medical, roller missions, etc.)
        allowing sufficient time to load aircraft. Use locally developed AF IMT 4100s for
        changes affecting standard configuration.
        1.2.3. Make clear and concise entries in aircraft forms concerning Chart-C discrepancies
        to include the discrepancy, item and location. Aircrew will notify QA of discrepancies at
        debrief.
     1.3. AMXS AME-21 :
        1.3.1. Ensure all AME-21 equipment weights are available for use in determining aircraft
        weight.
        1.3.2. Forward all AME-21 equipment weights to the 22 OG Air Refueling Manager
        (22 OG/OGV) to aid the boom operators in mission planning and developing new AF
        IMT 4100 configurations as weights or new items are added to inventory.
        1.3.3. Ensure accurate legible copies of the AF IMT 4100 configuration is posted in the
        weight and balance book at the time of configuration.

      for any weight changes, i.e. acceptance, depot input, PCS, depot return or equipment
      modification.
   1.4. Maintenance Operations Squadron (MOS) Plans, Scheduling and Documentation :
      1.4.1. Notify W&BPM before starting and upon completion of any TCTOs affecting
      aircraft weight and balance.
      1.4.2. Create a G081 AFTO Form 781A entry for any TCTO requiring a weight and
      balance update when issued to the primary agency for completion of TCTO. Entry in
      AFTO 781A should read “A/C requires weight and balance update due to TCTO XXXX
      accomplishment."

      and developing AF IMT 4100 as weights or new items are added to or deleted from
      inventory.
      1.5.3. Place all life support equipment in pre-approved locations and secure on the
      aircraft according to day-to-day AF IMT 4100 configurations and IAW T.O. 1C-135-9.

   1.6. QA Product Improvement Manager will work with Contract Field Team to
   provide W&BPM:
      1.6.1. Aircraft weight and balance book within 24 hours of receipt of the aircraft. If the
      aircraft is received on a weekend, deliver the book the following duty day.
      1.6.2. A list of TCTOs in work that may affect weight and balance of aircraft.
2. AMXS and Maintenance Squadron Production Supervision will:
   2.1. Notify the W&BPM at the start of any TCTO that alters the aircraft center of gravity
   through the removal or addition of equipment by maintenance personnel on any aircraft.
   2.2. Notify W&BPM of weight and balance as soon as changes are made. IAW T.O 00-20-1
