2.1. General
     2.1.1. This guidance articulates USAF processes, provides procedural guidance, and
     specifies Headquarters USAF, MAJCOMs, and unit responsibilities for implementation of
     and compliance with the OST. It also provides direction and planning factors for
     implementing the OST.
     2.1.2. This guidance provides implementation direction for USAF activities in support of the
     OST mission to include: coordination and scheduling of missions, initiative development and
     coordination, training, financial oversight, Service representation in OST working groups,
     utilization of USAF assets and personnel, and input into the U.S. Open Skies platform and
     related hardware choices. It also spells out U.S. Government (USG) and USAF
     organizational responsibilities.
     2.1.3. All U.S. forces within the territory of an OST signatory (includes all U.S. territory and
     many European countries, reference Paragraph 2.3.1.), are vulnerable to over flight during
     OST observation missions in accordance with the OST and National Security Presidential
     Directive (NSPD) 13, United States Policy and Organization for the Implementation of the
     Treaty on Open Skies, May 6, 2002.
     2.1.4. This guidance is designed to be a basic reference and information resource to Air
     Force personnel involved with OST implementation.
     2.1.5. USAF facilities/forces directly impacted by the OST include those designated as Open
     Skies Points of Entry/Exit (POE/POX), Open Skies Airfields (OSA), Open Skies Refueling
     Airfields (OSRA), Open Skies Gateways, transit airfields, and Open Skies Media Processing
     Facilities (OSMPF). The OST also directly impacts the base and maintenance facilities for

        2.1.5.1. (Added-PACAF) PACAF bases directly impacted by the OST include
        Elmendorf AFB, AK, which is designated as an Open Skies Airfield, an Open Skies
        Gateway, and an Open Skies Transit Airfield; Hickam AFB, HI, which is designated as
        an Open Skies Refueling Airfield; and Yokota AB, Japan, which can be used as an Open
        Skies Gateway.
        2.1.5.2. (Added-PACAF) Other PACAF installations may be designated to support
        OST missions. Such designation will take place in coordination with the affected
        installation, HQ PACAF, and AF/A5XP.
     2.1.6. Affected MAJCOMs (see Paragraph 4.1.5.) will develop implementation plans and
     procedures to execute this guidance.
2.2. Introduction
     2.2.1. The Eisenhower Administration originally proposed an Open Skies regime in 1955.
     Eisenhower's Open Skies regime, presented to the Soviets during the Geneva Summit in
     Switzerland, was a bilateral initiative that sought to protect against a nuclear attack by
     superior forces. At the height of the Cold War, the Soviets found this initiative unacceptable.

   2.2.2. With a decline in superpower tensions, President George H. W. Bush revived the
   Open Skies concept in 1989. Negotiations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
   (NATO) and former Warsaw Pact nations to formulate a treaty began in Ottawa, Canada in
   February 1990, and continued in Budapest, Hungary in April 1990. However, these talks
   reached no conclusive agreement. With the failed Soviet coup in Moscow, Russian
   Federation and the subsequent changes it brought, the collapsing Soviet Union agreed to
   open its territory to aerial observation. Negotiations resumed in Vienna, Austria in
   November 1991, and the multi-national OST was signed in Helsinki, Finland on 24 March
   1992.
   2.2.3. Within the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
   (OSCE), the goal of the OST is to strengthen peace, stability, and cooperative security by
   promoting openness and transparency of military forces and activities. The Treaty
   establishes a regime of aerial observations of the signatories' territory in order to gather
   information about military forces and activities. By establishing this regime of observation
   flights, the Treaty seeks to increase confidence and security among its signatories, facilitate
   verification of other arms control agreements, and provide information for crisis management
   and conflict prevention.
   2.2.4. Overflight of OST states by observing Party aircraft equipped with Treaty-compliant
   sensors will occur as the focal point of the Treaty’s confidence and security building regime.
   As a result, the entire U.S. sovereign territory and U.S. assets in any OST State Party are
   susceptible to imaging from Open Skies aircraft during observation flights.
   2.2.5. Six months after entry-into-force (EIF) the treaty was opened to accession by any
   interested State, subject to consensus by the current signatories in the Open Skies
   Consultative Commission (OSCC). The OST is not restricted geographically.
   2.2.6. Observation and demonstration flights may be flown over the entire territory of all
   signatories and take priority over regular air traffic. For the U.S. this scenario is covered in
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order 7110.65P, Air Traffic Control, Paragraph 9-2-
   21. Transit flights are not covered by this FAA Order. Once the flight plan is agreed upon,
   only flight safety considerations may restrict the conduct of observation flights.
   2.2.7. The OST entered-into-force on 1 January 2002.            Three years of phased
   implementation followed during which no more than 75% of the quota allocation could be
   conducted. The OST entered into full implementation on 1 January 2006.
2.3. Participating States Parties
   2.3.1. States party to the OST as of 1 October 2009:

2.4. Quota Distribution
        2.4.1. Passive quotas: the number of observation flights that a State Party is legally obligated
        to receive/accept annually as an Observed Party.
        2.4.2. The distribution of Passive observation quotas is listed below.

                                          Chapter 4

                   TREATY COMPLIANCE OFFICE RESPONSIBILITIES

4.1. Major Commands (MAJCOM) Treaty Officer Responsibilities
   4.1.1. MAJCOM arms control duties and responsibilities are derived from AF Policy
   Directive 16-6 Arms Control Agreements, AFI 16-601 Implementation of, and Compliance
   with, Arms Control Agreements, and AFI 16-603 Education and Training Requirements for
   Implementation of, and Compliance with, Arms Control Agreements.
   4.1.2. Each MAJCOM will ensure its subordinate Wings/Units fulfill their arms control
   implementation and compliance requirements. Specifically, AFIs 16-601 and 16-603 require
   MAJCOMs to:
      4.1.2.1. Establish an arms control office or point of contact to address applicable treaties
      and agreements;
      4.1.2.2. Ensure that personnel involved with arms control activities receive education
      and training; and
      4.1.2.3. Conduct overall arms control implementation in their command.
   4.1.3. MAJCOM Treaty Officers play a crucial role ensuring the Air Force meets its arms
   control obligations. They provide a critical link between subordinate Wings/Units, the
   MAJCOM, and the Air Staff. Their responsibilities include compliance with guidance,
   compliance planning, liaison, training, and resource management. Information on these
   specific responsibilities is provided in the paragraphs below.
   4.1.4. Duties
      4.1.4.1. Compliance Guidance. MAJCOM Treaty Officers develops and coordinates
      guidance for their subordinate Wings and Units.
      4.1.4.2. Review and coordinate on higher headquarters Directives and Instructions.
      MAJCOM Treaty Officers will participate in the review and coordination of arms control
      implementation, compliance, and guidance. They will staff higher headquarters taskers to
      all pertinent organizations and will provide a consolidated MAJCOM response when
      requested.
      4.1.4.3. Implement Arms Control Guidance. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible
      for ensuring subordinate Wings/Units implement DoD, Higher Headquarters and
      MAJCOM policies to ensure compliance with arms control treaties and agreements, thus
      ensuring consistent application of guidance across MAJCOMs and at the base level.
   4.1.5. MAJCOM Open Skies Treaty Compliance Plans
      4.1.5.1. The MAJCOM Treaty Officers will develop a MAJCOM-level Open Skies
      Treaty Compliance Plan to ensure standardized compliance procedures throughout their
      MAJCOM. The MAJCOM Open Skies Compliance Plan must comply with, and
      complement guidance issued by higher headquarters, the DoD and the USG. The
      MAJCOM Open Skies Compliance Plan will define procedures for adherence to the OST
      and will articulate overall MAJCOM guidance in order to ensure compliance with the
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                         27


     OST. (Note: this requirement to develop a MAJCOM OST Compliance Plan is only
     applicable to those MAJCOMs having within their infrastructure, Wings/Units designated
     to support OST activities, i.e., AFMC, ACC, AMC, PACAF and USAFE.)
     4.1.5.2. Plans must address all subordinate Wings and Units on bases that are affected by
     OST operations and observation activities.
     4.1.5.3. MAJCOM plans will define applicable rules/directives and task affected Wings
     to support treaty requirements. In addition, MAJCOM Treaty Officers are also
     responsible for maintaining and reviewing subordinate Wing/Unit compliance plans.
  4.1.6. MAJCOM Treaty Officer Roles and Responsibilities
     4.1.6.1. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible for coordination with MAJCOM
     programs that may impact treaty obligations.
     4.1.6.2. Some treaty obligations, like modifications to mission equipment and sensors,
     are accomplished by contractors. Affected MAJCOM Treaty Officers will coordinate
     and monitor contractual agreements to ensure work is completed according to treaty
     specifications.
     4.1.6.3. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible for training and guidance for
     Wing/Unit personnel.
     4.1.6.4. MAJCOM Treaty Officers’ primary role, if present during an OST mission when
     the Wing/Unit TCO is also present, is to observe treaty activities to improve their
     understanding of how bases support and execute their plan to comply with treaty
     protocols.
        4.1.6.4.1. While MAJCOM Treaty Officers are in an observer’s role, they may help
        the base meet OST requirements by interfacing through the Wing/Unit TCO.
        4.1.6.4.2. By directing all MAJCOM Treaty Officer inputs to the Wing/Unit TCO,
        the treaty team is ensured of having one consistent base point of contact for working
        issues and requesting support.
        4.1.6.4.3. The Wing/Unit TCO will be the mission interface with the DTRA Escort
        Team Chief. Wing/Unit TCO responsibilities are detailed in Paragraph 4.2.
        4.1.6.4.4. MAJCOM Treaty Officers shall not interfere with the DTRA Escort team’s
        role in the treaty compliance process and shall not interact with the foreign team
        representatives unless specifically requested to do so by the DTRA Escort Team
        Chief.
     4.1.6.5. MAJCOM Treaty Officers, if present at a host airfield during an OST mission,
     shall not directly represent USG, DoD or Air Force positions to either the DTRA Escort
     Team or to foreign team representatives during the execution of the OST mission,
     including during crew rest and cultural activities, unless the MAJCOM Treaty Officer is
     acting in the capacity of the Wing/Unit TCO, or unless asked by the DTRA Escort Team
     Chief.
        4.1.6.5.1. MAJCOM Treaty Officers must have a current understanding of existing
        USG, DoD, and Air Force positions/guidance relating to the hosting of OST activities
        on U.S. territory and/or USAF bases.
28                                              AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


        4.1.6.5.2. If questions arise, the MAJCOM Treaty Officer should coordinate with
        their chain of command and/or AF/A5XP for clarification. The MAJCOM Treaty
        Officer will advise the Wing/Unit TCO with responses to communicate to the DTRA
        Escort Team.
     4.1.6.6. Identification and prevention of any alleged prohibited activity when the DTRA
     Escort Team and foreign team representatives are at a host airfield during an OST
     mission shall be in accordance with USG, DoD and/or Air Force guidance and shall be
     the responsibility of the DTRA escort team, supported by the Wing/Unit TCO, in direct
     support of treaty compliance.
        4.1.6.6.1. The MAJCOM Treaty Officer has the responsibility to promptly notify
        their chain of command, including AF/A5XP, of any alleged prohibited activity
        reported by their Wing/Unit TCOs during OST activities at hosted airfields, the
        circumstances of those activities, and the resultant actions taken.
  4.1.7. Command and Control
     4.1.7.1. Effective command and control is critical for treaty implementation, especially
     during observation activities.
     4.1.7.2. Timely and accurate treaty notifications are essential to facilitate proper facility
     preparations. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible for ensuring MAJCOM
     Command Post Controllers have current notification formats and use proper reporting
     procedures to notify subordinate Wings/Units and tenant organizations of upcoming OST
     events. These notification formats and reporting procedures can be found in the Open
     Skies Community of Practices (CoP) on the AF/A5XP Portal.                              (See:
     [https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID
     =OO-XP-AF-31-7-5&Filter=OO-XP-AF-31]                   or         contact         AF/A5XP
     (open.skies@pentagon.af.mil) or DSN 224-0676) for this info.
        4.1.7.2.1. Each MAJCOM and subordinate units must have a 24-hour point of
        contact for OST notifications. It is vital that all organizations that may be impacted
        receive proper and timely notifications. Notifications of intent to conduct observation
        activities over the U.S., or over nations hosting U.S. Air Force personnel and
        equipment, affect all U.S. Air Force Units on the territory of Open Skies participating
        states. However, notification of the observation flight route may only affect those
        activities along the specific flight route.
  4.1.8. Liaison between Wing, MAJCOM and AF/A5XP
     4.1.8.1. Command Focal Point. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are the focal point for OST
     matters as they affect the MAJCOM.
     4.1.8.2. Communications. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are a vital communications link
     between subordinate Wings/Units and AF/A5XP and combatant command. They are a
     key player in sharing information across the Open Skies community. In particular,
     MAJCOM Treaty Officers keep AF/A5XP informed of any activity at designated Open
     Skies airfields that could impact OST activities, e.g., runway closures, air shows, major
     exercises/operations that impact ramp space or billeting challenges, etc.
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                              29


  4.1.9. Training
     4.1.9.1. Arms Control Training and Awareness. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are
     responsible for ensuring subordinate Wing/Unit TCOs and MAJCOM personnel receive
     appropriate OST training. Training can be accomplished by attending the AF Arms
     Control Overview Course, AF- level OST workshops, MAJCOM-level arms control
     workshops, and by participating in JTFs and/or U.S.-only Blue-on-Blue training
     activities.
     4.1.9.2. Arms Control Courses. DTRA offers a semi-annual OST course in the
     Washington, DC area. MAJCOM and Wing/Unit TCOs are highly encouraged to
     participate. They are announced in advance to all MAJCOMs.
     4.1.9.3. JTFs and Blue-on-Blue training flights. Joint and U.S.-only training flights are
     valuable training activities for the aircrews, mission teams, and airfield logistics support
     activities and also for the notification process. They validate operational procedures and
     airfield OST compliance plans to validate logistics support capabilities, security
     procedures and hosting responsibilities. They provide opportunities for TCOs and base
     facilities to operationally train in a near “real-world” environment. TCOs should strive to
     make these exercises as “real” as possible; taking time, manpower, cost and mission team
     requests/desires into consideration. During these training activities artificial scenarios are
     introduced and after-hours support may not be necessary.
  4.1.10. Resource Management
     4.1.10.1. MAJCOM Treaty Officers function as resource managers, monitoring arms
     control (including OST) funding and manpower. Successful execution requires close
     coordination between MAJCOM Treaty Officers, base TCOs, and appropriate financial
     management counterparts. Budgeting and manpower requirements differ from base to
     base and MAJCOM to MAJCOM. Effective resource management is necessary to ensure
     sufficient funding and proper program execution.
     4.1.10.2. Budget. MAJCOM Treaty Officers act as command PEM for PE 35145F or
     they work closely with their PEMs.
         4.1.10.2.1. PEMs are responsible for managing resources and budgeting funds for
         MAJCOM arms control activities and ensuring MAJCOM Wing requirements are
         included in budget submissions. The MAJCOM treaty office and FM work with the
         field units to build an Execution Plan.
         4.1.10.2.2. AF/A5XP validates the MAJCOM Execution Plan by rationalizing the
         OST requirements within the Air Force arms control budget.
         4.1.10.2.3. The Unit Treaty Offices provide their requirements to the MAJCOM
         Treaty Officers, which consolidate these requirements and submit them to AF/A5XP.
         MAJCOM Treaty Officers must ensure that all subordinate Wing/unit requirements
         are identified and defended, when necessary.
            4.1.10.2.3.1. MAJCOM Treaty Officers must also ensure that all requirements
            comply with fiscal requirements in the DoD FMR Vol. 5, AFI 65-601 VI and AFI
            65-603.
 30                                             AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


          4.1.10.2.4. MAJCOM and subordinate Wing/Unit TCOs must work closely together
          to ensure funding requests and distributions are received in a timely manner.
      4.1.10.3. Manpower. MAJCOM Treaty Officers are responsible for monitoring
      manpower authorizations and identifying and defending manpower requirements. Most
      Wings, some MAJCOMs, and other arms control billet authorizations are centrally
      managed by AF/A5XP. These billets are not under the control of MAJCOM planners.
      Moving or reclassifying a billet requires coordination and concurrence from AF/A5XP.
      In accordance with AFPD 16-6 and AFI 16-601, MAJCOM planners must ensure they
      have the appropriate billet authorizations assigned to support MAJCOM headquarters and
      subordinate Wing/Unit arms control requirements.
4.2. Wings/Units Treaty Compliance Officer (TCO) Responsibilities
   4.2.1. Duties, Roles and Responsibilities
      4.2.1.1. Compliance Plans. Each Wing/Unit designated as an Open Skies airfield will
      have an OST compliance plan applicable to that airfield. Those airfields not designated
      to host OST operations should have provisions to ensure appropriate support for OST
      aircraft that may divert (for weather, emergency or special circumstance) to their airfield.
      (Note: Because of the requirement in AFI 16-603 for Wing TCOs to maintain Wing
      Implementation and Compliance Plans for applicable treaties, even those airfields not
      designated to directly support OST observation activities or those that are potentially
      alternate airfields should have a plan (i.e., Wing Protocol Plan) ready to carry out the
      mission if it becomes necessary.) (Note: This requirement to develop a Wing/Unit OST
      Compliance Plan is only applicable to those Wings/Units designated to support OST
      activities, i.e., 13AF (Hickam AFB, HI); 3LRS (Elmendorf AFB, AK); 22ARW
      (McConnell AFB, KS); 78ABW (Robins AFB, GA); 60AMW (Travis AFB, CA); 28BW
      (Ellsworth AFB, SD); 88ABW (Wright Patterson AFB, OH); and 100ARW (RAF
      Mildenhall, UK).)
          4.2.1.1.1. The Wing/Unit OST compliance plan will detail the logistics support to
          facilitate OST activities to ensure all OST timelines are met. These Wing/Unit
          compliance plans should be coordinated with their parent MAJCOM and the DTRA
          Open Skies Division. Provide completed plans to AF/A5XP through normal
          distribution.
          4.2.1.1.2. The Wing/Unit OST compliance plan should include (but is not limited to)
          base support procedures, escort requirements, notifications and reports, procedures to
          notify local personnel and affected organizations, security provisions, photography
          policy, weather support provisions, billeting and transportation requirements, protocol
          and public affairs procedures.
          4.2.1.1.3. An important component of the compliance plan is the base activity
          checklists, which are needed for recording required actions. The OST compliance
          plan identifies offices/organizations responsible for providing logistics support to the
          visiting observation aircraft and mission teams. The final plan should include a list
          showing all organizations tasked by the plan including other tenant organizations.
          4.2.1.1.4. Suggested components of a Compliance Plan
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                        31


          4.2.1.1.4.1. Services. This includes lodging, dining and mortuary services.
          Lodging and dining arrangements will always need to be planned in advance.
          Consult with the DTRA Open Skies Division for lodging preferences and
          requirements.
          4.2.1.1.4.2. Security. This section needs to include high and low threat security
          procedures for escorts, guards, inspector entry into controlled areas, operations
          security (OPSEC), and communications security (COMSEC). NOTE: Inspectors
          must not view our normal security procedures.
             4.2.1.1.4.2.1. High threat options would be imposed if a known threat to the
             inspection is recognized. It could include measures such as posting guards
             and implementing entry control points requiring Entry Access Lists (EAL)
             granting the mission teams and local escorts authorized access to inspection
             sites and support facilities.
             4.2.1.1.4.2.2. Low threat options may require implementation of normal
             distinguished visitor procedures.
             4.2.1.1.4.2.3. OPSEC procedures such as limiting photography, access, and
             controlling travel routes should be included. The flight line and other areas of
             sensitive operations must be protected. (Reference Air Force policy on the
             use of personal cameras in paragraph 7.12.)
             4.2.1.1.4.2.4. COMSEC concerns, e.g. how inspectors are allowed to
             communicate with their Embassy/consulate, must be included in your
             preparations. Example: have local escorts establish the link prior to foreign
             inspectors’ use.
          4.2.1.1.4.3. Medical.       Arrangements for emergency/non-elective medical
          treatment of mission team members must be included. The DTRA is responsible
          for the cost of all medical treatments and is billed accordingly.
          4.2.1.1.4.4. Communications. This section must include public address systems
          for ceremonies/briefings, contact between local escorts, methods for inspectors to
          contact their embassies or sponsoring activities, or other treaty-specific items.
          4.2.1.1.4.5. Transportation. All personnel transportation requirements, arrival
          thru departure (covering both primary and alternate locations), and equipment /
          baggage handling to include special handling instructions for inspection
          equipment are included in this section. The TCO will attempt to accommodate
          the DTRA Team Chief’s requests for support of transportation for off-base and
          cultural activities for the foreign teams as much as practical, within existing
          guidelines/restrictions. In cases where Wing Commander approval is required for
          the type of activity or location, the TCO will facilitate that request.
          4.2.1.1.4.6. Funding. Considerations include specific billing and payment
          procedures. Ensure the DTRA Team Chief, or his/her designated liaison, knows
          what is required in advance. Coordinate with base activities for items DTRA may
          request to accomplish their responsibilities (e.g., pagers for standby personnel).
          Coordinate with your MAJCOM Treaty Officer and PEM, preferably in advance
32                                      AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


     of incurring expenses, for reimbursement of expenses not paid by DTRA, or that
     DTRA will not pay. If DTRA is not able to fund a TCO request, O&M dollars
     may be pursued at the discretion of the local Wing/Unit commander as long as the
     requirement is authorized IAW financial regulations.
     4.2.1.1.4.7. Public Affairs. Clearly established ground rules on control of media
     movement and actions are necessary to prevent interference with inspections. The
     USG and DoD posture for OST flights is “passive.” This means we can respond
     to inquiries, but not actively promote activities. There are no restrictions placed
     on articles for the base newspaper or website that reflects the OST mission or an
     activity in progress, or has recently happened.
     4.2.1.1.4.8. Personnel. Personnel include base escorts, facility managers, baggage
     details, measurement teams, and inspection support staff. Support staffs are
     individuals working real-time contingencies while the treaty office is busy with
     inspectors; support staff should have a representative from each key support and
     inspection organization.
     4.2.1.1.4.9. Training. TCOs are responsible for ensuring all base players in an
     OST activity are well trained and able to perform their duties including suitability
     of local escorts. Not everyone is suited to perform escort duties-- maturity is a
     key ingredient in selecting local escorts. While no specific certification is
     required, Commanders should ensure mature individuals are selected.
     Commanders may use exceptional junior personnel only under exceptional
     circumstances. Commander support in maintaining the required number of
     trained escorts is very important. In most cases, periodic refresher training is
     desirable and necessary. At other times just-in-time training of local personnel
     may be all a base can complete due to task saturation and limited availability of
     personnel. Bases should have a goal of maintaining a pool of trained personnel, as
     continuity promotes a high level of efficiency and support for complying with
     treaty protocols.
     4.2.1.1.4.10. Safety/Security. Upon arrival at a host airfield the TCO must
     present a safety/security briefing to the visiting mission teams. These briefings are
     adapted to the local environment, provide a perspective of the base and facilities
     to be used by the mission teams, weather conditions the teams should expect, base
     security policies, escort procedures and photography policy, and whom to contact
     should any visiting person need assistance. These briefings must be developed in
     advance and coordinated with the DTRA Open Skies Division for translation into
     Russian. NOTE: Whatever safety/security rules the TCO levies on the foreign
     mission teams, must also be followed by the U.S. mission teams and the local
     base escorts. Foreign Teams may not always abide by our flight line safety rules
     and procedures. However, we must continue to inform them of our rules and
     available safety equipment.
     4.2.1.1.4.11. Identification of any alleged prohibited activity when the DTRA
     Escort Team and foreign team representatives are at a host airfield during an OST
     mission shall be in accordance with USG, DoD and/or Air Force policy/guidance
     and shall be the responsibility of the DTRA escort team, supported by the
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                              33


             Wing/Unit TCO, in direct support of treaty compliance.
             4.2.1.1.4.12. Protocol. Protocol activity includes arrangements for distinguished
             visitors (DV), arranging off- base meals, hosting reception and departure
             functions, closing ceremonies, and memento exchanges. By Air Force definition,
             the foreign OST mission team members are afforded the rights and privileges of
             DVs under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
             4.2.1.1.4.13. Cultural Activities. At the DTRA Team Chief’s request, pre-
             coordinate and facilitate leisure activities such as tours, shopping, and recreational
             opportunities. Work with affected services: Transportation, Base Exchange,
             Commissary, Recreational Services and affected civilian establishments.
     4.2.1.2. Reports. Submit reports consistent with the guidance in Chapter 6.
     4.2.1.3. Open Skies TCO positions are a scarce manning resource. Frequently TCOs
     have no, or, minimally-trained backup. As such, duties not directly related to treaty
     activities will not be assigned when they directly interfere with TCO duties.
  4.2.2. Base Expert. As the Wing expert on the Open Skies Treaty, TCOs are required to
  perform dynamic, comprehensive analysis of the impact of Open Skies activities on the base,
  tenant units, separately located facilities, and associated missions. This requires all TCOs
  have a general knowledge of the Open Skies Treaty. In this role, TCOs answer questions
  regarding the Open Skies Treaty as well as identify and explain the effect this Treaty will or
  may have on the Wing’s military and commercial activities.
     4.2.2.1. The inspection process is associated with the observation aircraft and flight
     operations, but the TCOs are responsible for logistics support to aircraft operations and
     mission teams.
     4.2.2.2. TCOs host observation aircraft for Open Skies missions and training flights.
     This involves coordination from a variety of supporting activities such as: Base Ops,
     weather support, transportation, dining and billeting, force protection, security and
     OPSEC units, aircraft services (fuel, water, air, de-icing, lavatory, flight meals, and
     parking),    protocol and public affairs, medical and recreational services,
     meeting/conference rooms and communications availability, and escorting.
     4.2.2.3. For bases that host aircraft inspection procedures, particular attention must be
     paid to facilitating flight line activities, including photography and access requirements.
     4.2.2.4. TCOs must work closely with their base counterparts to identify possible
     problems and recommend solutions.
     4.2.2.5. Open Skies missions are conducted against a strict timeline directed by the
     Treaty. There is flexibility in the timelines, but TCO inability to facilitate ground support
     actions that cause the mission to deviate from those timelines can result in violations of
     the Treaty, creating a diplomatic challenge. OST timelines are identified in OST, Article
     VI.
     4.2.2.6. Routine airfield maintenance such as runway/taxiway construction and
     renovation, or modifications to the navigation aids associated with landing/ take-off
     procedures can pose a potential implementation challenge. For instance, if a runway is to
     be closed for a period of time to undergo resurfacing, etc., AF/A5XP must be notified so
34                                             AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


     the U.S. Government can notify all other Open Skies states parties of the availability of
     that airfield. This requires TCOs maintain a working relationship with base organizations
     to ensure they are well aware of base projects that may impact Open Skies activities.
     4.2.2.7. Major base/Community events that could impact Open Skies operations must be
     afforded the same attention. Air shows, marathons, exercises, inspections, weather
     events (i.e., hurricane staging support), etc., may limit ramp space, transportation or
     billeting availability and can affect the ability to host Open Skies activities.
     4.2.2.8. Open Skies activities are typically short-notice events. TCOs may have as little
     as 24-36 hours pre-notification they are going to host a foreign aircraft and mission team.
     Therefore, having a Compliance Plan in place to support these events is crucial. The plan
     must be well-laid out and practiced so it can be implemented quickly. Routine training of
     escorts and awareness briefings for Wing leadership is a key to the success of the event.
     Open Skies missions may appear to be low key activities, but receive high U.S.
     Government and/or international attention when things go wrong.
  4.2.3. Education, Training, and Exercises. Education, training, and exercise activities are
  not expected to be an in-depth study on the Open Skies Treaty. They should focus on the
  timeline for the event, Wing and escort responsibilities, OPSEC and impacts/vulnerabilities
  of observation collection flights.
     4.2.3.1. Base TCOs develop and maintain Wing training programs. Information can be
     obtained from other bases, MAJCOMs, AFOSI, DTRA, DTIRP, and AF/A5XP. TCOs
     should participate in and conduct training appropriate to their responsibility.
  4.2.4. Logistics Support
     4.2.4.1. Aircraft Support. TCOs at airfields supporting Open Skies activities will
     provide aircraft servicing and maintenance as required and/or as requested by the 55th
     Wing or the DTRA Escort Team Chief. This includes, but is not limited to: refueling,
     gaseous oxygen, nitrogen, de-icing, ground equipment, power carts, air stairs, water,
     latrine servicing, and weather support and flight meals.
         4.2.4.1.1. Standard Air Force safety procedures apply for aircraft servicing activities.
         4.2.4.1.2. Bills for fuel and other aircraft services for foreign observation aircraft
         should be submitted to the DTRA Escort Team Chief or financial agent.
         4.2.4.1.3. U.S. personnel will not enter foreign owned, operated or registered aircraft
         without permission from the DTRA Escort Team Chief following consultation with a
         member of the foreign observation team.
         4.2.4.1.4. U.S. personnel will not conduct maintenance on foreign owned, operated
         or registered aircraft without the expressed permission of the DTRA Escort Team
         Chief and the Aircraft Commander.

                                         Chapter 5

                  MISSION TASKING, PLANNING AND EXECUTION

5.1. Mission Tasking
   5.1.1. Active and passive mission quotas are determined and deconflicted in accordance with
   the OST. AOMs are determined by the governing NSPD and the USG Interagency; tasked
   by OSD(Policy) and SECDEF/CJCS EXORDS, DEPORDS and IMPORDS; and flown to
   fulfill national collection objectives generated by USG entities. The NGA is responsible for
   collection priorities. JTFs with partner country participants are approved by both the USG
   Interagency Backstopping Group and the DoD OSIWG.                     JTFs are tasked by
   OUSD(AT&L)/PSA/TC.                OCONUS JTF’s are included in SECDEF/CJCS
   DEPORDS/IMPORDS. U.S.-only training flights in CONUS are coordinated between
   DTRA and the Air Force and are approved by the OSIWG.
      5.1.1.1. The schedule approved by the USG Interagency and OSIWG constitutes tasking
      to support the Open Skies schedule. The schedule forwarded from AF/A5XP to the Air
      Force MAJCOMs and other affected agencies/offices constitutes tasking to Air Force
      components to support the USG Open Skies schedule. In addition, any OCONUS
      activities are tasked by SECDEF/CJCS DEPORDS/IMPORDS.
      5.1.1.2. AOM scheduling is determined by time of year and areas of interest, is
      deconflicted with allies who also want observation quotas over the same State Party, is
      approved by the USG Interagency Backstopping Group, is tasked by OSD(Policy) and is
      further tasked by a SECDEF/CJCS DEPORDS/IMPORDS.
          5.1.1.2.1. CJCS, in SECDEFs name, tasks the Commander, JFCOM to deploy the
          U.S. Open Skies aircraft to the EUCOM AOR to conduct Treaty-quota AOMs and
          OCONUS JTFs via quarterly DEPORDS/IMPORDS. TRANSCOM and PACOM are
          tasked to support the deployments, as/if required.
          5.1.1.2.2. JFCOM, in turn, tasks Commander, ACC to deploy the USAF Open Skies
          aircraft, typically via follow-on DEPORD.
          5.1.1.2.3. ACC tasks the 55th Wing (55WG) to support the Open Skies deployment
          with dedicated organic assets, including an OC-135B Open Skies aircraft, air and
          maintenance crews, and Aeronautical Systems Engineers (ASE)/ Sensor Maintenance
          Technicians (SMTs).
          5.1.1.2.4. The 55th Wing tasks the 55th Operations Group (55OG), who in turn tasks
          the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron (45RS) to deploy assets to support the Open Skies
          tasking.
      5.1.1.3. JTFs are approved by the USG Interagency Backstopping Group and
      deconflicted by the OSIWG.
          5.1.1.3.1. OUSD(AT&L)/PSA/TC, Chair of the OSIWG, then distributes the JTF
          schedule to OSIWG members for approval.
              5.1.1.3.1.1. For OCONUS JTFs in the U.S. Open Skies aircraft, the aircraft
              deployment is tasked via DEPORD/IMPORD following procedures similar to
 36                                              AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


              taskings for AOMs.
              5.1.1.3.1.2. For CONUS JTFs in the U.S. Open Skies aircraft, the events are
              reflected on the schedule distributed by the OSIWG and forwarded to ACC by
              AF/A5XP.
      5.1.1.4. U.S.-only training activities, e.g. Blue-on-Blue flights, are coordinated with and
      approved by the OSIWG, and reflected in the schedule distributed by the OSIWG. This
      schedule is forwarded by AF/A5XP to affected Air Force MAJCOMs and other affected
      agencies/offices.
      5.1.1.5. AF/A5XP represents Air Force equities and interests at the OSIWG. The
      OSMPF and MAJCOMs make inputs into the OSIWG process thru AF/A5XP. ACC will
      make AF/A5XP aware of any/all issues associated with aircraft and crew availability in
      order to avoid tasking those assets when not available. If ACC cannot support a tasked
      activity, they must provide rationale to AF/A5XP as soon as practical, with an estimate of
      next availability.
5.2. Mission Planning
   5.2.1. A Mission Planning Cell (MPC) consisting of representatives from NGA,
   DTRA/OSOO, and 45RS will develop mission plans for all tasked missions a minimum of
   three (3) weeks prior to any tasked mission. The MPC will submit completed mission plans
   to the OSIWG no later than 14 days prior to the planned aircraft movement for a tasked
   mission.
      5.2.1.1. For active missions, general responsibilities are as follows:
          5.2.1.1.1. NGA chairs the MPC, provides collection objectives, and certifies the
          mission plan meets collection objectives.
          5.2.1.1.2. DTRA provides Treaty expertise and certifies the mission plan meets
          Treaty guidelines.
          5.2.1.1.3. 45RS representatives provide aviation expertise and certify the mission
          plan is flyable and OC-135B safety of flight and operating parameters are met. If
          required, the 45RS will request operating waivers, with justification, from the
          appropriate authority.
   5.2.2. Mission planning for overseas Open Skies missions will be conducted at DTRA
   headquarters at Fort Belvoir, VA.
      5.2.2.1. For CONUS JTF missions, planning will be scheduled at the beginning of the
      JTF mission.
   5.2.3. All mission planning and execution will be done based on a 16-hour crew day.
      5.2.3.1. If the flight crew is augmented, this will be for duty not involving flying (DNIF)
      coverage only and will not extend the crew duty day.
   5.2.4. Missions will be planned to provide 12 hours of crew rest between flight duty periods.
      5.2.4.1. Flight duty period is defined as a period that starts when an aircrew reports for
      mission, briefing, or other official duty and ends when engines are shut down at the end
      of the mission, mission leg, or a series of missions.
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                               37


      5.2.4.2. Crew rest does not begin until the completion of the last official duty event,
      including transportation from the event to aircrew lodging.
      5.2.4.3. The flight duty period begins at the transportation show time for the subsequent
      flight duty period.
   5.2.5. DTRA/OSOO will distribute a Deployment Memorandum (DM) as soon as possible
   following each MPC, identifying parameters of the event, timeline/itinerary and names of
   individuals involved. 45RS and the OSMPF are responsible for providing names of their
   personnel involved in the activity to DTRA at the MPC or as soon as practicable.
   5.2.6. Mission plans for other tasked missions will be developed on an ad hoc basis and
   submitted as soon as practicable.
   5.2.7. All passport and visa requirements for 55WG personnel will be coordinated directly
   with DTRA/OSO. DTRA/OSO will track and submit required forms for final processing.
5.3. Mission Execution
   5.3.1. The DTRA Team Chief is the Mission Commander and senior USG representative,
   responsible for the conduct of the observation mission itself.
   5.3.2. The aircraft commander is responsible for all safety of flight issues associated with the
   operation of the USAF Open Skies aircraft.
   5.3.3. Mission execution will be coordinated between the DTRA Mission Commander and
   the Aircraft Commander in accordance with the existing Memorandum of Agreement
   between DTRA/OSO and the 55OG.
      5.3.3.1. All issues related to the aircraft and aircraft safety will be brought to the Mission
      Commander’s attention via the Aircraft Commander.
      5.3.3.2. The Aircraft Commander is responsible for aircrew and aircraft operations, flight
      safety and keeping the Mission Commander informed.
      5.3.3.3. The Maintenance Supervisor is responsible for the maintenance team and all
      aircraft maintenance issues and shall keep both the Aircraft Commander and Mission
      Commander informed.
      5.3.3.4. The Production Supervisor will report to the Aircraft Commander for all
      administrative and operational matters.
   5.3.4. All fees associated with a Treaty-quota AOM will be paid in accordance with OSCC
   Decision 01.
      5.3.4.1. “Fees shall not be charged either to a transiting State Party or to an observing
      State Party for the use of navigational aids and for air traffic control services, airport
      landing, takeoff, ground handling, parking and security for all Open Skies transit,
      transport, and observation flights.” (OSCC Decision 01)
5.4. Aircraft Commander Responsibilities
   5.4.1. The Aircraft Commander:
      5.4.1.1. Is responsible for safe conduct of the flight mission.
 38                                             AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


      5.4.1.2. Coordinates with the Mission Commander to ensure U.S. observation mission
      plans are executable, do not compromise safety of flight and are not hindered by safety of
      flight restrictions.
          5.4.1.2.1. The final decision to delay a mission, when conditions are not safe to
          start/continue the mission, will be made by the Aircraft Commander.
      5.4.1.3. Will ensure all observation team representatives are briefed on safety
      precautions prior to preflight inspection of the aircraft/sensors and prior to observation
      missions.
      5.4.1.4. Will observe national flight rules and airspace restrictions of the observed State
      Party and of any transited states.
          5.4.1.4.1. If flight plan deviations are required, the Aircraft Commander will
          coordinate with the Mission Commander prior to deviating (if possible) and take
          appropriate action in accordance with published observed Party national flight
          regulations and instructions from appropriate aviation authorities.
      5.4.1.5. Will provide the Mission Commander timely information on mission progress.
      5.4.1.6. Will comply with the flight operations manual and Procedures for Air
      Navigation Services - Rules of the Air and Air Traffic Services, ICAO Document No.
      4444-RAC/50/12, as revised or amended, in the event of an emergency.
      5.4.1.7. Will submit all operational and situational reports in accordance with the 55WG
      Manual and the applicable EXORD and Implementation Order.
5.5. Aircrew Training and Qualifications
   5.5.1. The U.S. Open Skies mission involves operating specially equipped USAF OC-135B
   aircraft on observation flights over foreign countries, primarily the Russian Federation,
   Belarus, and Ukraine. Observation missions may entail low altitude flights in austere
   locations with limited infrastructure support, in diplomatically sensitive environments with a
   degree of mission uncertainty. Aircrews and maintenance crews must be appropriately
   trained and certified for these high visibility missions.
   5.5.2. Aircraft Commanders will not be mission qualified for Open Skies deployments until
   they have participated in at least two Open Skies missions. An Aircraft Commander on a
   second Open Skies mission may be the pilot-in-command if accompanied by a qualified
   Open Skies Aircraft Commander.
   5.5.3. Basic OC-135B aircrew training, evaluation criteria and operations procedures are
   listed in AFIs 11-2RC-135, Volume 1, 2 and 3.
5.6. Aircraft and Sensor Maintenance
   5.6.1. The OC-135B should be capable of operating independently of unique support
   equipment for periods of up to two weeks.
      5.6.1.1. Logistics support during an Open Skies mission will primarily consist of
      organizational-level maintenance provided by dedicated crew chief(s) and additional
      aircraft and sensor maintenance personnel aboard the aircraft.
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                      39


     5.6.1.2. Maintenance planning and scheduling for Organizational, Intermediate, and
     depot level maintenance of on-equipment and off-equipment sustainment activities, will
     be coordinated through HQ ACC functional managers and managed by HQ AFMC (or
     contracted maintenance services, as appropriate).
     5.6.1.3. Specific maintenance crew requirements for deployment will be determined by
     the 55th Wing and listed in the 55WG Manual.

                COMMUNICATIONS, NOTIFICATIONS AND REPORTS

6.1. General. This section details communication and notification responsibilities for
compliance with the OST. Voice, fax, and electronic notification reports will be passed to units
to alert them of impending overflight events and mission status. Notifications include: Intent
to conduct an observation, arrivals at and departures from POEs/POXs, OSAs and OSRAs,
proposed/approved mission plans, delay/termination of observation flights, and other
miscellaneous reports.
   6.1.1. Notifications associated with Passive Observation Missions are identified in the
   OSIWG SOP 05-01: Open Skies Passive Notification Procedures, March 1, 2005 and in SOP
   05-03: Open Skies Training Coordination Process and Notification Procedures for Training
   Flights over the United States, December 13, 2005. These SOPs can be found in the Open
   Skies         CoP        on        the       AF/A5XP          Portal.              (See:
   https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO
   -XP-AF-31-7-5&Filter=OO-XP-AF-31 or contact open.skies@pentagon.af.mil or DSN
   224-0676) for this info.
6.2. Types of Notifications. Note: The following paragraphs address the notification
processes in CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii. The notification process in Europe is very
different and is detailed in the HQ USAFE Open Skies Compliance Plan.
   6.2.1. Voice Format (VF) Notifications. Open Skies VF notifications are transmitted from
   the DTRA Operations Center to the Headquarters Air Force Operations Center. From the AF
   Operations Center they are automatically distributed to the Air Force MAJCOM Operations
   Centers/Command Posts and additional offices, including AF/A5XP. MAJCOMs then re-
   distribute these VF notifications to their units, tenant organizations and TCOs.
       6.2.1.1. Standard VF notifications can be found in the Open Skies CoP on the AF/A5XP
       Portal.                                                                          (See:
       https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=
       OO-XP-AF-31-7-5&Filter=OO-XP-AF-31 or contact open.skies@pentagon.af.mil or
       DSN 224-0676) for this info.
   6.2.2. Telephone Notification System (TNS).
       6.2.2.1. DTRA is tasked with making early notification of Open Skies missions over the
       U.S to USG Departments/Agencies, the FAA, and related industry sites/facilities
       throughout the U.S. To accomplish this, DTRA developed two computer systems: The
       Passive Overflight Module (POM), and the TNS. Both systems are a part of the Open
       Skies Management and Planning System (OSMAPS) which provides DTRA with
       computerized mission analysis, planning, flight following, and assessment capabilities.
           6.2.2.1.1. The POM performs analysis of Open Skies overflights by foreign
           observers.    It generates notification messages to sites requesting overflight
           information. Messages are sent using the TNS.
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                               41


           6.2.2.1.2. The POM/TNS is an automated notification system, utilizing both
           telephone and facsimile networks, to a designated list of sites. All USAF components
           should take advantage of the POM/TNS.
               6.2.2.1.2.1. There are two distribution lists associated with the POM: Standard
               Call List and Affected Call List.
                   6.2.2.1.2.1.1. The Standard Call List includes telephone and fax numbers of
                   Service and MAJCOM Headquarters’ and others as requested.
                   6.2.2.1.2.1.2. The Affected Call List includes telephone and/or fax numbers
                   of everyone on the Standard Call List, plus those locations in the direct path of
                   an expected observation overflight.
               6.2.2.1.2.2. Units not receiving TNS notifications and wish to be added to the
               distribution list, or desire a change, should contact AF/A5XP
               (open.skies@pentatgon.af.mil or DSN 224-0676) to be added to the distribution
               lists. The Air Force TNS notification list is at the Open Skies CoP on the
               AF/A5XP                       Portal.                                    (See:
               https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&Fol
               derID=OO-XP-AF-31-7-5&Filter=OO-XP-AF-31                    or         contact
               open.skies@pentagon.af.mil or DSN 224-0676) for this info.
               6.2.2.1.2.3. To add a unit to the POM Standard or Affected Call Lists, please
               follow the procedures identified by DTRA in the Open Skies CoP on the
               AF/A5XP                      Portal.                                    (See:
               https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&Fol
               derID=OO-XP-AF-31-7-5&Filter=OO-XP-AF-31                   or         contact
               open.skies@pentagon.af.mil or DSN 224-0676) for this info.
   6.2.3. Electronic Notifications: At this time, these are informal notifications from
   DTRA/OSOC to OSIWG members only.
       6.2.3.1. AF/A5XP transmits these electronic notifications to a wide distribution list. This
       distribution is a back-up to the official notification process. Units that wish to be added
       to this distribution list contact AF/A5XP (open.skies@pentagon.af.mil).
6.3. High Value Activity (HVA) Reporting. Note: The following paragraphs address the HVA
reporting processes in CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii. Commands in Europe have little
opportunity to impact overflights of host nations, but can affect U.S. activities that could impact
the overflight, or be impacted by the overflight. The process for reporting significant events in
Europe and for protecting U.S. activities from any adverse impact of the OST overflight is
detailed in the HQ USAFE Open Skies Compliance Plan.
   6.3.1. Upon Receipt of a Notification of Intent to Conduct an Observation Flight over U.S.
   (VF#1) MAJCOMs will initiate the collection of HVA from their subordinate/ tenant
   units/facilities to determine any activities within their purview that could impact or be
   impacted by an observation over flight. MAJCOMs will report their HVA, or a Negative
   Report, to AF/A5XP at DSN 224-0676, Commercial (703) 614-0676 or
   open.skies@pentagon.af.mil as soon as possible after receipt of a VF#1, but no later than 48
   hours after its receipt. AF/A5XP must deliver these HVA Reports to the DoD HVA Group
42                                                 AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


  (HVAG) no later than 24 hours prior to arrival of the observation aircraft at the designated
  POE.
     6.3.1.1. The HVAG (reference Paragraph 3.1.5.) receives submissions of HVA Reports
     from the Services and DoD Agencies and provides guidance to the DTRA U.S. Escort
     Team with respect to mission plan negotiations. If an Observing Party’s proposed
     mission plan is impacted by an identified HVA, or if an HVA impacts the flight, the U.S.
     Escort Team may receive guidance to attempt to negotiate with the Observing Party to
     adjust the flight route to avoid the HVA.
     6.3.1.2. HVA procedures are detailed in OSIWG SOP 05-02: High Value Activities
     (HVA) Notification Procedures, May 13, 2005. The SOP and the HVA report format
     template is provided in the Open Skies CoP on the AF/A5XP Portal. (See:
     https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=
     OO-XP-AF-31-7-5&Filter=OO-XP-AF-31 or contact open.skies@pentagon.af.mil
     DSN 224-0676) for this info.)
  6.3.2. In general, an HVA is an activity that:
     6.3.2.1. Will incur substantial monetary cost if postponed or cancelled,
     6.3.2.2. Cannot be concealed and reveals national security information if observed,
     6.3.2.3. Takes advantage of a unique set of chronological or meteorological
     circumstances which cannot be duplicated, or
     6.3.2.4. The command/agency believes special circumstances apply.
  6.3.3. The criteria for an HVA are dynamic and subject to change and interpretation.
  Typical examples of HVA that might be reported by Air Force include space shuttle
  launches/ recoveries and space/missile launches. Other examples of HVA that may be
  reported are weapons movements, operations or major exercises, and equipment testing.
  6.3.3.1. It is the responsibility of the reporting unit to report those events they feel may meet
  the requirements of an HVA. It is also their responsibility to protect their HVA from
  observation, as they would from satellite vulnerability. Various protective measures are
  available, such as: cancelling or postponing the HVA, shrouding or moving the sensitive
  equipment indoors during the period of vulnerability, or relocating the sensitive equipment to
  another location that may not be vulnerable to observation.
     6.3.3.2. AF/A5XP is responsible for evaluating Air Force HVA Reports and for
     presenting them to the DoD HVAG. Subsequently the Treaty Manager, will give
     guidance to the DTRA Escort Team Chief in the event the proposed observation flight
     impacts an HVA.
  6.3.4. Before reporting an HVA, unit personnel and MAJCOMs need to evaluate the
  following:
     6.3.4.1. Can the activity be deconflicted with the observation overflight window of
     vulnerability?
     6.3.4.2. Can the activity be delayed? At what cost?
     6.3.4.3. What is the cost to cancel the activity?
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                             43


  6.3.5. With each HVA Report, the unit/MAJCOM must indicate their recommendation
  associated with this HVA.
     6.3.5.1. If the HVA can be deconflicted, the recommendation would likely be to report
     the HVA for information only.
     6.3.5.2. If the unit’s preference is to seek to negotiate around the event, negotiating
     guidance will be given to the DTRA Escort Team Chief.
     6.3.5.3. If the recommendation is to avoid the HVA, then the reporting unit will need to
     provide the name and immediate contact information for the senior flag officer
     supporting the HVA. This recommendation is a recommendation to violate a legally
     binding international treaty. This scenario is serious and will involve guidance from the
     HVAG or higher.
  6.3.6. Criteria in the OST for negotiation of a mission flight route and seeking changes to a
  flight route:
     6.3.6.1. OST, Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 4. “The observed Party shall have the
     right to propose changes to the mission plan as a result of any of the following
     circumstances:
         6.3.6.1.1. The weather conditions affect flight safety;
         6.3.6.1.2. The status of the Open Skies airfield to be used, alternate airfields, or
         refueling airfields prevents their use; or
         6.3.6.1.3. The mission plan is inconsistent with Article VI, Section II, Paragraphs 2
         and 4.” OST, Article VI, Section II, Paragraph 2: “The mission plan may provide for
         an observation flight that allows for the observation of any point on the entire
         territory of the observed Party, including areas designated by the observed Party as
         hazardous airspace in the source specified in Annex I. The flight path of an
         observation aircraft shall not be closer than, but shall be allowed up to, ten kilometers
         from the border with an adjacent State that is not a State Party.” OST, Article VI,
         Section II, Paragraph 4: “The mission plan shall include all information necessary to
         file the flight plan and shall provide that:
             6.3.6.1.3.1. the observation flight does not exceed the relevant maximum flight
             distance as set forth in Annex A, Section I;
             6.3.6.1.3.2. the route and profile of the observation flight satisfies observation
             flight safety conditions in conformity with ICAO standards and recommended
             practices, taking into account existing differences in national flight rules, without
             prejudice to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of this Section;
             6.3.6.1.3.3. the mission plan takes into account information on hazardous
             airspace, as provided in accordance with Annex I;
             6.3.6.1.3.4. the height above ground level of the observation aircraft does not
             permit the observing Party to exceed the limitation on ground resolution for each
             sensor, as set forth in Article IV, Paragraph 2;
             6.3.6.1.3.5. the estimated time of commencement of the observation flight shall
             be no less than 24 hours after the submission of the mission plan, unless otherwise
 44                                             AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


              agreed;
              6.3.6.1.3.6. the observation aircraft flies a direct route between the co-ordinates
              or navigation fixes designated in the mission plan in the declared sequence; and
              6.3.6.1.3.7. the flight path does not intersect at the same point more than once,
              unless otherwise agreed, and the observation aircraft does not circle around a
              single point, unless otherwise agreed. The provisions of this subparagraph do not
              apply for the purposes of taking off, flying over calibration targets, or landing by
              the observation aircraft.”
      6.3.6.2. OST, Article VI, Section II, Paragraph 6. “No later than four hours after
      submission of the mission plan, the observed Party shall accept the mission plan or
      propose changes to it in accordance with Article VIII, Section I, paragraph 4 and
      paragraph 5 of this Section. Such changes shall not preclude observation of any point on
      the entire territory of the observed Party, including areas designated by the observed
      Party as hazardous airspace in the source specified in Annex I to this Treaty. Upon
      agreement, the mission plan shall be signed by the observing and observed Parties. In the
      event that the Parties do not reach agreement on the mission plan within eight hours of
      the submission of the original mission plan, the observing Party shall have the right to
      decline to conduct the observation flight in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII
      of this Treaty.”
      6.3.6.3. OST, Article VIII, Section I, Paragraph 5. “In the event that the observing Party
      disagrees with the proposed changes to the mission plan, it shall have the right to submit
      alternatives to the proposed changes. In the event that agreement on a mission plan is not
      reached within eight hours of the submission of the original mission plan, and if the
      observing Party considers the changes to the mission plan to be prejudicial to its rights
      under this Treaty with respect to the conduct of the observation flight, the observing
      Party shall have the right to decline to conduct the observation flight, which shall not be
      recorded against the quota of either State Party.”
6.4. Treaty Compliance Officer (TCO) Reports
   6.4.1. If requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief, the TCO will make aircraft departure
   reports to the DTRA Operations Center as soon as practical after the observation aircraft
   takes off.
   6.4.2. The TCO will pass After Action Reports (AAR) to the MAJCOM following any OST
   observation activity that unit hosts. The MAJCOM will pass these AARs to AF/A5XP.
   6.4.3. TCOs will report security incidents such as unauthorized photography, to the local Air
   Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)/security forces, their MAJCOM, and the
   DTRA Escort Team Chief. These incidents should be reflected in any AARs.
6.5. Aircraft Commander Operational Reports (OPREP) and Situational Reports
(SITREP) .
   6.5.1. The deployed aircraft commander will submit routine and situational reports in
   accordance with the 55WG Manual and applicable EXORDS and Implementation Orders.
   6.5.2. The DTRA Mission commander will send a SITREP for each leg of the mission after
   coordinating with the Aircraft Commander and the Production Supervisor.
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                         45


     6.5.2.1. This SITREP, as a minimum, will contain takeoff and landing times and
     locations, condition of the aircraft and crew and any miscellaneous information warranted
     by the situation.
     6.5.2.2. This SITREP is not intended to replace any additional reporting requirement for
     either DTRA or the 55th Wing.

                                           Chapter 7

                                     MISCELLANEOUS

7.1. Financial Management (FM)
   7.1.1. Funding. AF/A5XP is the Air Force PEM for all USAF arms control treaties and
   agreements’ related costs, including Open Skies. The Arms Control PE is 35145F.
      7.1.1.1. Observation aircraft expenses to include maintenance, operations and flying
      hours are funded thru PE 35145F.
      7.1.1.2. Periodic depot maintenance, technical order updates, and engineering
      sustainment costs are typically 3400 money and are programmed by AFMC/A4 (CAM).
      7.1.1.3. Programming for modification of the OC-135 airframe using appropriation 3010
      depends on who “owns” the requirement. ACC may program for an OC-135-only
      modification and program for those modification funds separately. Typically, the
      modification takes place at the AFMC modification center and the customer will request
      the modification be made to accommodate modernization to the mission equipment. ACC
      and AFMC/A4 must remain vigilant to the modification requirements and program
      accordingly.
      7.1.1.4. The flying unit’s Open Skies manpower authorizations are also funded from the
      Arms Control PE.
      7.1.1.5. Infrastructure-related costs to support Treaty Compliance Offices and the
      OSMPF, including associated manpower, are funded thru PE 35145F.
   7.1.2. MAJCOM Treaty Officers submit annual requests for funding under the Arms Control
   PE in accordance with instructions provided separately.
      7.1.2.1. ACC: Budget for and reimburse DTRA for aircraft and aircrew-related expenses
      the DTRA mission team pays for during AOM. Note: During AOM’s all mission-related
      expenses (accommodations and meals for the entire deployed crew, fuel and aircraft
      services) are paid by DTRA.
7.2. Manpower, Personnel and Training
   7.2.1. AF/A5XP established a structure of Arms Control manpower to support Air Force
   implementation of, and compliance with arms control treaties and agreements. Personnel
   billets associated with this structure man MAJCOM arms control offices, unit Treaty
   Compliance Offices, a portion of the flying unit supporting the observation aircraft, and the
   OSMPF.
   7.2.2. In accordance with AFI 16-601 all MAJCOMs will establish an office of primary
   responsibility and specific points of contact for arms control.
   7.2.3. HQ ACC maintains responsibility for manpower associated with the flying unit
   supporting the observation aircraft to include filling all authorized billets and the
   qualifications of flying personnel. Of primary concern is the consistent availability of trained
   and qualified air and maintenance crews who are deployable to support all OST tasked
   missions.
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                               47


   7.2.4. HQ AFISRA maintains responsibility for manpower associated with the OSMPF,
   including fulfillment of all authorized billets. Of primary concern is the capability to support
   the processing of media products from both U.S. and foreign OST missions, including the
   capability to handle materials used in processing of products. Members of the OSMPF must
   be deployable for OST activities overseas.
   7.2.5. All personnel having OST responsibilities must take advantage of appropriate training
   opportunities (DTRA training courses, Air Force workshops, etc.). In addition, host units
   must maintain a cadre of trained escorts to support incoming foreign OST teams.
7.3. Legal
   7.3.1. SAF/GCI will provide legal support on matters involving the interpretation and
   implementation of the OST. The servicing Staff Judge Advocate to the Combatant
   Commander or its Air Component will provide legal advice on questions arising from
   mission planning and operations management and the review of any related documents.
7.4. Observation Team Arrival Procedures
   7.4.1. The Wing Commander, or designated representative, will meet the visiting team upon
   arrival of an observation aircraft to a host unit. Particular attention should be paid to foreign
   aircraft/team members.
   7.4.2. Notification of the incoming team will list the manifest of personnel, including
   positions within the team. The DTRA Escort Team Chief and the foreign Team Chief(s)
   should be readily identifiable by their name tags.
   7.4.3. The observation aircraft should be parked in an area close to Base Operations if
   possible, in a hangar (if weather prevents required aircraft maintenance outdoors), or another
   location dictated by the security situation. If possible, the aircraft should be positioned in
   such a way to allow start-up and taxi to the runway without towing.
      7.4.3.1. Towing of the foreign observation aircraft is discouraged unless absolutely
      necessary for security or maintenance. Towing or hangaring the foreign aircraft should
      be conducted as a last resort and only if requested by the foreign Team Chief. If
      required, and appropriate support equipment is available, the foreign maintenance
      personnel should complete the task using their personnel. Should the aircraft be towed
      by U.S. personnel and damage to the aircraft incurred, it may become the responsibility
      of the USG. to repair or replace it. (OST, Annex D, Sect 2, Para 11.)
   7.4.4. Local base escorts and appropriate security forces, if necessary, should be
   immediately available to support the arriving teams. Provisions should be made to expedite
   transportation of personnel to the next event (Welcome/Arrival briefings, stop at billeting,
   etc.) and movement of luggage/gear from the aircraft to the appropriate location.
   7.4.5. The hosting unit TCO will present an Arrival and local Safety briefing as soon as
   practicable after arrival of the observation teams. These briefings should be pre-coordinated
   with DTRA because of the requirement for translation.
 48                                             AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


7.5. Defector Procedures
   7.5.1. Should any foreign OST team member indicate their desire to defect to an Air Force
   representative, the escort shall immediately inform the DTRA Team Chief. The DTRA
   Team Chief, as the senior U.S. Government representative, will take actions as appropriate.
       7.5.1.1. If the indication happens when on U.S. soil (or on a U.S. base in a host nation),
       the Air Force hosting unit will take no actions unless requested by the DTRA Escort
       Team Chief. Should the DTRA Escort Team Chief request assistance, the TCO should
       immediately inform unit leadership, base security and the local AFOSI representative.
       7.5.1.2. If the indication happens outside of the U.S. while onboard the U.S. observation
       aircraft, the DTRA Team Chief will be notified immediately and will take full
       responsibility for follow-on actions. When appropriate, and as soon as possible, situation
       reports will be made to the OPCON Commander.
7.6. Public Affairs (PA)
   7.6.1. In accordance with 2005 OASD(PA) guidance, the DoD PA posture is: Passive,
   response to inquiry only.
   7.6.2. Hosting units should accommodate media coverage of Open Skies activities IAW
   DOD "Principles of Information," SAF/PA, DTRA/PA and OASD(PA) guidance.
       7.6.2.1. Unit PA offices will comply with established higher level PA guidance and
       should develop an internal information plan to accommodate this guidance.
       7.6.2.2. Local media interest may be accommodated on a not-to-interfere basis with
       Open Skies activities, and only with the DTRA Escort Team Chief’s concurrence.
       7.6.2.3. The unit PA office will keep the community aware of OST activities via routine
       meetings between key civic leaders and base officials.
       7.6.2.4. Prepared news releases will be used whenever possible.
   7.6.3. The Armed Forces Information Service will coordinate all Armed Forces Radio and
   Television Service support activities to ensure continuity.
   7.6.4. In the event of a defection or death of a foreign Open Skies team member, all queries
   will be referred to the Department of State. No local comments, confirmations, etc., will be
   made.
7.7. Protocol
   7.7.1. Hosting foreign OST observation missions is a national, legal obligation. The foreign
   team must be afforded the opportunity to exercise their rights under the OST. The host units
   must facilitate the conduct of the event.
   7.7.2. Reception of the visiting OST teams must be polite, courteous and accommodating.
   7.7.3. Observation team members typically travel under Diplomatic passports. In any event,
   observation team members must be accorded the rights, privileges and immunities outlined in
   the OST, Article XIII and in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 18 April
   1961.
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                              49


   7.7.4. In the event a dignitary, VIP or flag officer accompanies the observation activity,
   appropriate protocol accommodations must be afforded them. Coordinate these procedures
   with the DTRA Escort Team Chief.
   7.7.5. Nearly all OST activities include a formal dinner or function outside of treaty
   requirements. These will be coordinated by the TCO and the host Unit Protocol Office.
   Appropriate host unit representation, at a level commensurate with the visibility of the
   activity, should be provided. These events should not be open to the media.
       7.7.5.1. Gifts and/or mementoes, if exchanged at these events, should be purchased and
       accounted for using Official Representation Funds (ORF), identified in the unit’s annual
       budget submission in coordination with the Wing/Unit Commander. ORF expenditures
       must adhere to AFI 65-603.
       7.7.5.2. Escort personnel on a meal card must follow guidance in the DFAS-DE Manual
       7073-1. Meals consumed by a Treaty escort while TDY are already covered by per diem
       entitlement.
       7.7.5.3. Local travel reimbursements will be reimbursed IAW Wing/Unit local travel
       instructions.
7.8. Host Unit Local Activities
   7.8.1. Units hosting OST activities may be called upon to support or facilitate leisure time
   activities for members of the observation teams during periods when they are not required to
   support OST functions. Creativity, ingenuity and flexibility on the part of the TCO are
   encouraged. Leisure activities are part of hosting, particularly if there are significant delays
   in resuming a mission due to aircraft repairs, weather constraints, etc.
   7.8.2. On-base activities may include, but are not limited to, visits to the Base Exchange
   and/or Commissary, Class Six store, clothing sales, Officer and/or Enlisted Clubs, cafeterias
   and fast food establishments, museums or displays, athletic center or other recreational
   facilities. If the Base Exchange and/or Commissary are visited, the TCO will be responsible
   for crowd control and will coordinate with the facility manager to provide a separate check-
   out lane. If requested, cash register tapes/receipts for foreign OST team members will be
   provided to a DTRA escort.
       7.8.2.1. As guests of the United States, observation team members will be authorized the
       use of the Base Exchange and Commissary, Class Six store, convenience stores and
       Officer and/or Enlisted Clubs. At the clothing sales store, only non-issue military
       clothing/items may be purchased. The hosting unit TCO will notify any of these facilities
       prior to the arrival of the observation team. For bases outside the U.S., access to these
       facilities will be in accordance with host nation rules and regulations, and standing Status
       of Forces Agreements (SOFA).
   7.8.3. Off-base activities include shopping, tourist and recreational activities, etc. Any off-
   base activity, including when the teams are housed off-base, will require notification to
   AFOSI and base security to ensure appropriate coordination with local, state or federal
   authorities. Off-base security falls under the jurisdiction of the local, state or federal
   authorities, and will not be provided by base security forces.
 50                                              AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


      7.8.3.1. The DTRA Escort Team has sole responsibility for all visiting OST personnel
      during on- and off-base activities.
      7.8.3.2. If requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief, the TCO may provide, as
      available, local base escorts and drivers to facilitate movement off-base. This does not
      relieve the base of the responsibility to provide transportation for the observation teams,
      but allows them flexibility if the DTRA Escort Team Chief does not require this type of
      assistance.
7.9. Local (Base) Escort Procedures
   7.9.1. Local escorts are required to assist the DTRA Escort Team and to facilitate OST
   activities/events when foreign observation teams and/or aircraft and crews are operating from
   their base.
   7.9.2. Local escorts are site-knowledgeable base representatives designated as points of
   contact for the DTRA Escort Team. They will be in the grades of E-4 and above and will be
   supervised by senior NCOs (E-7 or above), officers or civilians. While no specific
   certification is required, Commanders should ensure mature individuals are selected.
   7.9.3. Host units will provide local escorts to support OST activities/events as follows:
      7.9.3.1. Wing Commanders at U.S. Air Force bases hosting OST activities/events will
      assign local escorts to assist the TCO and DTRA Escort and foreign observation teams in
      their movement on and off the property under the responsibility of the Wing Commander.
      7.9.3.2. Local escorts will report to the TCO and be relieved of all other assigned
      responsibilities while performing escort duties associated with OST activities/events.
      Units should have a qualified medical escort assigned throughout the OST activity.
      7.9.3.3. The unit TCO will maintain a current list of local escorts, and designate and train
      replacements as necessary to ensure continuous availability of escorts for short-notice
      OST activities.
      7.9.3.4. Local escorts must have, as a minimum, a Secret security clearance, and access
      to restricted areas where OS aircraft may be parked, including sufficient number of local
      escorts with driving privileges for restricted areas (i.e. flight line, etc).
      7.9.3.5. Local escorts are not expected to be trained as security specialists; however they
      should be trained to recognize and react to anticipated elicitation and human intelligence
      (HUMINT) gathering techniques. OPSEC procedures still apply.
      7.9.3.6. Local escorts are not expected to be conversant about OST information, U.S.
      Government policies concerning OST issues and the conduct of OST activities at other
      USAF OST airfields.
      7.9.3.7. Local escorts have two responsibilities while on base: (1) the protection and
      safety of visiting OST personnel, and (2) the security of site facilities. Local escorts
      should limit access of personnel not needed to support the OST mission from areas
      supporting OST activities/events.
      7.9.3.8. Local escorts should wear visible badges when in the company of visiting OST
      personnel. These badges are for identification only.
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                                 51


      7.9.3.9. Local escorts/drivers should never be left alone with foreign OST personnel.
      7.9.3.10. Local escorts should not accept DTRA Escort responsibilities.
      7.9.3.11. Local escorts should be knowledgeable enough to facilitate movement of the
      visiting OST teams to and from scheduled activities, the flight line, medical facilities,
      dining facilities and accommodations, and to on- and off-base shopping locations.
      7.9.3.12. Local escorts should be knowledgeable in base security procedures, access
      requirements to the base and flight line.
      7.9.3.13. Local escorts should be flexible and patient, as plans often change. They
      should have constant communications capability with the TCO to report unexpected
      situations and to seek guidance.
      7.9.3.14. Local escorts may volunteer for off base/cultural events if requested by DTRA
      Team Chief.
7.10. Medical and Dental Support / Mortuary Services
   7.10.1. Host units are expected to provide or arrange for emergency/non-elective
   medical/dental care as necessary and as requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief, for team
   members to accomplish their duties, save lives or stabilize injuries. Military treatment
   facilities will be used unless the severity of the illness/injury and transport stabilization needs
   deem otherwise.
   7.10.2. If transportation to a local civilian medical facility is required, the host unit’s medical
   escort will accompany the member and the DTRA escort and will stay with them at the local
   facility until care is rendered. The military medical staff will coordinate care with the
   civilian facility as required. The DTRA Escort Team Chief will be kept apprised of the
   patient’s condition and treatment at all times.
   7.10.3. If the member requiring medical/dental care is an aircrew member, the host unit’s
   Flight Surgeon’s office will be notified.
   7.10.4. Transportation to an appropriate POX, if required, will be accomplished via usual air
   evacuation procedures after coordination with the DTRA Escort Team Chief and foreign
   Team Chief.
   7.10.5. In the event of the death of an observation team member, the DTRA Escort Team
   Chief will provide any and all guidance. The death will not be reported through any channels
   until cleared by the DTRA Escort Team Chief. Arrangements for mortuary services shall be
   in accordance with USAF regulations, local and state laws, U.S.-host nation arrangements,
   foreign preferences, and in coordination with the DTRA Escort Team Chief.
      7.10.5.1. The TCO will, after being cleared by the DTRA Escort Team Chief, report any
      death to the MAJCOM Treaty Office and to AF/A5XP (DSN 224-0676 or
      open.skies@pentagon.af.mil) as soon as practicable, along with circumstances of the
      death.
   7.10.6. All medical care provided to a non-US member will be billed according to any host
   nation agreements in effect for the location where the care was provided. All civilian
   medical care provided to a non-US member will be billed by the civilian health care facility
 52                                               AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


   to the nearest consulate office of the country that the member is from, or to the Defense
   Threat Reduction Agency.
7.11. Host Unit Security
   7.11.1. Foreign observation team members typically travel under Diplomatic passports. In
   any event, observation team members must be accorded the rights, privileges and immunities
   outlined in the OST, Article XIII. As such, they and their accommodations, personal gear
   and baggage are immune from search and seizure while they are on U.S. territory.
   Additionally, no team member may be arrested or detained.
   7.11.2. The foreign observation team is identified by the DTRA Escort Team Chief at the
   POE. Their luggage and equipment are searched at the POE by DTRA and U.S. Customs
   personnel. Further searches are prohibited and any questions concerning searching should be
   directed to the DTRA Escort Team Chief.
   7.11.3. DTRA team members, their luggage and hand-carried items are exempt from
   searches unless dictated by a specific base security situation.
   7.11.4. It is Air Force policy that if no specific threat exists against the observation team or
   the host unit before or during their visit, additional security requirements are neither
   warranted nor appropriate. Treatment of the observation team as distinguished visitors
   should be sufficient.
   7.11.5. It is Air Force policy that the local base escort team has the primary responsibility for
   ensuring the protection and safety of observation team members and for limiting access to
   them by non-essential personnel.
   7.11.6. If a threat arises before or during the visit of an observation team, the host unit will
   react appropriately, inform the DTRA Escort Team Chief (prior to arrival if possible), and
   brief the arriving team of the situation, the precautions they should take and the protective
   measures being taken by the base.
   7.11.7. If a threat exists during an OST activity at a host unit, considerations should be taken
   to billet the observation team on base and limit/restrict their movement as much as possible,
   depending on the threat. If a credible threat exists to OST activities and movement is
   required to off-base locations, base Security Forces will advise the AF Office of Special
   Investigations (AFOSI) and local law enforcement agencies.
   7.11.8. If a credible threat exists, treaty activities may be restricted to on base and Security
   Force personnel posted on the boundaries of areas used for lodging, dining and other treaty
   activities. Off base activities require coordination with local law enforcement. If the threat
   warrants, this information must be passed expeditiously to AF/A5XP. If required, a
   recommendation to consider terminating the visit and removing the visitors from the area
   will be passed by the Air Staff to the USG Interagency.
   7.11.9. Foreign observation aircraft do not carry an assigned physical security protection
   level in accordance with AFI 31-101; however they must be protected as any foreign state
   aircraft. If the aircraft is to remain on station for a period of time, it must receive appropriate
   security protection measures.
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                              53


7.12. Photography Policy
   7.12.1. The Air Force photography policy for OST activities on host unit facilities is
   identified in the following subparagraphs. This policy is designed to address photography
   primarily during aircraft inspections at U.S. Air Force airfields hosting OST observation
   missions. Specifically, it covers the foreign teams taking photography of the U.S. inspection
   of their aircraft and for the U.S. team (from DTRA) to record the inspection process for the
   foreign teams, if so requested by the foreign team.
   7.12.2. Under the OST, the observed (i.e., hosting) state party has the right to conduct a pre-
   flight inspection of the foreign observation aircraft and sensors to ensure that they conform to
   the aircraft and sensors that were previously certified for observation flights and have been
   notified for use for observation activities.
      7.12.2.1. It has become the practice of the parties to allow the observing (i.e., hosted)
      state party to record the inspection process as it is being conducted by observed party
      inspectors.
      7.12.2.2. Equipment capable of recording images for this purpose has historically
      included cameras. Video cameras will not be used to record the aircraft inspection
      process for the hosted state party.
   7.12.3. While this paragraph policy does not override other Air Force photography policies,
   it does allow the U.S. Escort Team, foreign team members, and U.S. Technical Equipment
   Inspection (TEI) personnel, to take photographs of the observation aircraft during the aircraft
   inspection and, if desired, to document via photography the status of the sensor covers upon
   arrival at a POE, after a transit flight to an OSA, and prior to departure from a POX. As this
   is an official U.S treaty activity, all photography equipment should be declared and state
   owned.
      7.12.3.1. At all times, other than aircraft inspection and recording condition of sensor
      covers, photography must be coordinated between the DTRA Escort Team Chief and the
      Wing/Unit TCO who will request approval from appropriate base agencies.
      7.12.3.2. Requests for other mission-related or treaty-related photography should be
      submitted as soon as need is known. TCOs should have pre-established coordination
      procedures to expeditiously process requests and should be able to advise on expected
      response time from base agencies.
      7.12.3.3. The foreign observation team may attempt to take pictures upon arrival/landing
      at an airfield and on the ground during various arrival activities, which may go against
      current policies. TCOs should review the latest HQ USAF photography guidance for
      guidance on appropriate procedures for managing and reporting photography violations.
   7.12.4. This photography policy does not give a third party (i.e., the Wing/Unit, or other
   observers) authorization to photograph the aircraft inspection process or other mission-
   related activity on the flight line, unless pre-coordinated with the DTRA Escort Team Chief
   and the foreign Team Chief.
      7.12.4.1. Wing/Unit or MAJCOM personnel may take photographs of OST activities
      after satisfying the local approval process and after coordination between the Wing/Unit
54                                               AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


     TCO and the DTRA Escort Team Chief, who will coordinate with the foreign team Chief.
     Even the group photo has to be coordinated and approved by the foreign Team Chief.
     7.12.4.2. Uncoordinated or unapproved photography of the foreign team and aircraft may
     become a diplomatic issue the USG will have to address.
  7.12.5. As any deviation from established treaty practices can have undesirable diplomatic
  effects, photography of the aircraft inspection process (to include documenting sensor cover
  status before/after transit flights), will be considered as exceptional circumstances and will be
  allowed to continue to the extent possible within the constraints of standing Air Force
  security guidance and unit policies.
     7.12.5.1. Local commanders often authorize instances of flight line photography to
     support USG activities. DTRA escort teams receive this authorization specifically to
     support only Open Skies pre-flight inspection requirements. For any additional
     photography, pre-coordinate with the Wing/Unit TCO who can advise of requirements
     and, when necessary, forward the request for consideration by appropriate authority.
     7.12.5.2. Wing/Unit commanders should normally support these activities while making
     prudent efforts to protect security concerns.
     7.12.5.3. When unexpected circumstances occur for which commanders may be
     expected to further limit photography, Wing/Unit TCOs will expeditiously report to
     MAJCOMs, who will also expeditiously report to AF/A5XP, the circumstances, rationale
     and results.
     7.12.5.4. Since prohibiting customary photography may be viewed by treaty partners as
     an infringement of their treaty rights, AF/A5XP will rapidly report the circumstances to
     AF A3/5, SAF/GCI, the OUSD(AT&L) Treaty Manager, OSD Policy and the Joint Staff,
     and will prepare responses to USG Interagency questions as appropriate.
  7.12.6. The use of portable equipment capable of recording images will be monitored by the
  U.S. Escort Team, and will be observed by the base escort team.
     7.12.6.1. To facilitate understanding between all parties, the TCO will explicitly inform
     the U.S. Escort Team Chief of the policies applicable to that airfield. The TCO will
     specifically brief the arriving observation teams (both U.S. and foreign) on the local
     photography policies and procedures applicable to the airfield, and will be responsible for
     ensuring compliance with these policies.
     7.12.6.2. Photography will be carefully managed.
         7.12.6.2.1. Photographs should be oriented or framed to ensure only the intended
         image is taken.
     7.12.6.3. The TCO should attempt to limit unwanted imagery collection by parking the
     Open Skies aircraft to avoid photography of other assets in the vicinity.
         7.12.6.3.1. The observation aircraft can be placed in an isolated area away from other
         aircraft/buildings, or shrouded by innocuous structures. In addition, other more
         sensitive aircraft can be placed in a secure hangar, in an isolated area away from other
         aircraft/buildings, or shrouded by innocuous structures.
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                               55


   7.12.7. If there are any violations of this photography policy, they will be brought to the
   attention of the U.S. Escort Team Chief, who will address them immediately with the foreign
   Team Chief (if the violation is by the foreign team) or the individual involved (if the
   violation is by a member of the U.S. Escort Team).
      7.12.7.1. The observing party has a duty to respect the laws and regulations of the
      observed party. (OST, Article XIII, Section II, Paragraph 4.)
      7.12.7.2. Such incidents will be briefed to the base security forces, raised in the After
      Action Report (AAR) and provided to the MAJCOM and Air Force Treaty Offices.
   7.12.8. The OST, Article XIII, Section II, Paragraph 1, gives foreign inspectors diplomatic
   privileges and immunities, including the inviolability of their person and personal property.
   This means that to touch them or their property may violate their treaty rights.
      7.12.8.1. At no time should personal property be confiscated or involuntarily taken from
      the foreign inspectors.
   7.12.9. Nothing in this policy authorizes or encourages overt intelligence collection or the
   allowance of intelligence collection by photography.
7.13. Operational Security (OPSEC)
   7.13.1. OPSEC is a process of identifying, analyzing and controlling critical information
   indicating friendly actions associated with military operations and other activities to:
      7.13.1.1. Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems.
      7.13.1.2. Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed, and
      interpreted to derive critical information to be useful to adversaries.
      7.13.1.3. Select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the
      vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary exploitation.
   7.13.2. The purpose of OPSEC is to reduce the vulnerability of Air Force missions to
   successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical information. OPSEC applies to all
   activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all phases of operations. (AFI 10-
   701)
   7.13.3. It is not unexpected that members of foreign observation teams may attempt to gather
   information on our abilities, capabilities, operations, intentions, personnel and organizations.
   It is incumbent on our host unit personnel to be observant and diligent in protecting
   information that might be used to compromise our security, while at the same time being
   courteous and pleasant.
   7.13.4. If inquiries or actions of a foreign observation team member raise suspicions, the
   host-unit’s escort should notify the TCO, who should in turn notify the DTRA Escort Team
   Chief. Base security force representatives should be notified of any suspect situations.
7.14. Lodging and Messing
   7.14.1. Host unit TCOs should coordinate lodging and messing requirements/desires with
   the DTRA Escort Team Chief.
 56                                               AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010


   7.14.2. DTRA preference for billeting OST teams is off-base, in a hotel or hotels, preferably
   one hotel that can accommodate both the entire U.S. and foreign teams. Coordination for
   off-base lodging, if arranged by the host-unit TCO, will be through the base Lodging Office.
   7.14.3. In the event of a threat situation, lodging will likely be arranged in on-base facilities.
   This may involve creativity due to the short notice nature of OST activities and the relatively
   large size of the observation teams.
   7.14.4. For on-base lodging, certain precautionary measures may be taken in preparing the
   rooms, but extraordinary measures are not necessarily appropriate. The TCO should
   coordinate with the DTRA Escort Team Chief regarding requirements for lodging (such as
   housekeeping services, telephones, security protection and availability of a 24- hour on-site
   contact).
   7.14.5. Meals, both on- and off-base, should be coordinated between the TCO and the
   DTRA Escort Team Chief.
   7.14.6. U.S. observation team members will pay for their own accommodations and meals,
   while the DTRA Escort Team Class A Agent will pay for the foreign team members.
   7.14.7. The TCO should work with the Flight Kitchen to arrange for box lunches as
   requested by the DTRA Escort Team Chief. Payment for box lunches will typically be in
   advance. The TCO will coordinate with the DTRA Escort team to accommodate this
   payment.
7.15. Transportation
   7.15.1. Host unit TCO will coordinate transportation requirements with the DTRA Escort
   Team Chief.
      7.15.1.1. OST activities are conducted on a strict timeline. Transportation must account
      for road closures, base gate security procedures, and traffic situations to ensure adherence
      to this timeline. Transportation will account for weather delays and unanticipated events
      as best they can, and the OST activity will have to accommodate these situations.
      7.15.1.2. The TCO will attempt to accommodate the DTRA Team Chief’s requests for
      support of transportation for off-base and cultural activities for the foreign teams as much
      as practical, within existing policies/guidelines/restrictions. In cases where Wing
      Commander approval is required for the type of activity or location, the TCO will
      facilitate that request.
   7.15.2. The number and size of vehicles required will be determined by the activities being
   performed.
      7.15.2.1. For initial arrival, departure and movement to/from lodging for the first/last
      time, a separate van or truck for luggage should be provided.
      7.15.2.2. For full team movements, such as to cultural events, a VIP coach/bus may be
      appropriate.
      7.15.2.3. Separate vehicles for the air and maintenance crews may be needed.
   7.15.3. A cadre of qualified drivers will need to be available for the duration of the OST
   activity.
AFMAN16-604_PACAFSUP_I 6 JULY 2010                                                              57


7.16. Weather Support Policy
   7.16.1. The observation team requires up-to-date weather data. All flight weather briefing
   elements will conform to World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and International Civil
   Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards and be reported in both U.S. standard (inches of
   mercury (hg) and feet) and metric (millimeters of hg and meters) units where appropriate.
   7.16.2. Weather briefings will be provided at all OST airfields by the host Unit Weather
   Flight. Weather briefings at Dulles IAP POE/POX will be provided by the 88 OSS from
   Wright Patterson AFB, OH. The Dulles briefings may be provided on-site by the 88 OSS
   representatives, or by web-based presentations, as requested by the DTRA Escort Team
   Chief.
   7.16.3. Specific guidance for weather support to foreign Open Skies teams at U.S. OSAs and
   OSRAs is detailed below. Weather support for U.S. observation teams transiting Open Skies
   Gateways will be in accordance with the appropriate MAJCOM-DTRA Memorandum of
   Agreement (MOA).
   7.16.4. The host Unit Weather Flight will provide or arrange for weather support required by
   OST personnel during treaty activities at or originating from the host airfield as follows:
      7.16.4.1. The host Unit Weather Flight will develop a briefing providing local, take-off,
      en route and arrival weather using DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing. In addition,
      they will be prepared to brief/provide local weather for other OSAs and OSRAs.
      7.16.4.2. The Weather Squadron representative will provide a weather briefing to the
      observation team upon its arrival at the host airfield, daily weather briefings as requested,
      and pilot weather briefings prior to missions and training activities.
          7.16.4.2.1. The sample Open Skies weather briefing is available in the Open Skies
          CoP          on        the        AF/A5XP             Portal.               (See:
          https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderI
          D=OO-XP-AF-31-7-5&Filter=OO-XP-AF-31                  or       contact      open
          skies@pentagon.af.mil or DSN 224-0676 for this info.)
      7.16.4.3. The host Unit Weather Flight representative will provide daily weather
