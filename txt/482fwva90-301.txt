The Air Force has a well-established complaints program. It means getting help quickly and fairly without reprisal. You can make
your complaints at any level in the IG system. No one may act against you just because you made a complaint. If you think someone
has acted against you just because you complained, tell and inspector or the IG.

AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints Resolution is the governing directive for the IG complaints program. This instruction tells
you how to make a complaint and whom you should contact. You may go to an inspector or the IG at any level, but experience has
shown supervisors, first sergeants and commanders are the people best equipped to resolve complaints. Therefore, you are
encouraged but not required to discuss your problem with your supervisor, first sergeant, or your commander before going to t he IG.
