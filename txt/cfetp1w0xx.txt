Part I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support
resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide
personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.
Functional Managers, commanders, supervisors, and trainers use the CFETP to plan, manage,
and control training within the career field. This document applies to active duty, guard and
reserve component personnel holding a 1W0XX Primary AFSC. Civilians occupying associated
positions will use the CFETP Part II to support duty position qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts:

2.1. CFETP Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.
Section A, General Information, explains the uses of the CFETP. Section B, Career Progression
and Information, explains career progression information, duties and responsibilities, training
strategies, and career field path. Section C, Skill Level Training Requirements, associates each
skill level with specialty qualifications (e.g., knowledge, education, training, experience).
Section D, Resource Constraints, includes funds, manpower, equipment, facilities, impacts on
training capability, etc. Section E, Transition Training Guide is used only if two or more
specialties are merging and it outlines the specialty requirements to satisfy transition training
needs. This section is not used at this time for the 1W CFETP.

2.2. CFETP Part II contains the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and information on training
processes and resources. Section A, Specialty Training Standard, includes a listing of common
tasks applicable to Air Force Weather (AFW), a proficiency code to describe the performance
level and knowledge level taught in formal technical schools and Career Development Courses
(CDCs), and a technical reference for each task. Section A of the STS also identifies available
standardized Qualification Training Packages (QTP). Section B (Course Objective list) is not
used. Section C, Support Materials, lists available training support materials such as computer
based training (CBT) modules, video training tapes, etc. Section D, Training Course Index, lists
available AFW in-residence courses, Air Force Institute for Advanced Distributed Learning
(AFIADL) courses, and Field Training Detachment/Mobile Training Team (MTT) courses.

3. Using guidance provided in the CFETP ensures individuals receive effective and efficient
training at the appropriate point in their career. This plan enables AFW to train today’s weather
warriors for tomorrow’s missions. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use the CFETP
Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the goals of this plan and the
mission of the unit.




                                               1
ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED

Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL). ADL is an evolution of distance learning that
emphasizes collaboration on standards-based versions of reusable objects, networks, and learning
management systems, yet may include some legacy methods and media. ADL is structured
learning that takes place without requiring the physical presence of an instructor. Although the
Air Force uses the term advanced distributed learning, some federal agencies and DoD
components may use the term distance learning. These terms refer to the same basic concept.

Advanced Training (AT). Formal course which provides individuals who are qualified in one
or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS), with additional knowledge/skills to
enhance their expertise in the career field. Training is for a select number of advanced level
career airmen.

Section A - General Information

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides information necessary for AFCFMs, MFMs, commanders,
training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective
career field training program. Except where noted, this CFETP applies to active duty and
reserve component (Guard and Reserve) enlisted members holding a 1W AFSC. This plan
outlines the training individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress
throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, continuation,
advanced, and MAJCOM unique training. Initial skills training is the AFS-specific training an
individual receives upon entry into the Air Force, or upon retraining into this specialty, for award
of the 3-skill level. AETC conducts this training at Lackland AFB, TX, Keesler AFB, MS and
Pope AFB, NC. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification
requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 5-, 7-, and 9-
skill levels. Qualification training is hands-on, task performance training designed to qualify an
Airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the
upgrade training process and is designed to provide the performance skills and task knowledge
required on the job. Continuation training is additional training, beyond the minimum required
for upgrade, either in-residence, exportable, or OJT, to increase skills and knowledge, and
                                                   8
support progression within an AFS. Advanced training is formal specialty training used to
increase proficiency of selected airmen. The purposes of a CFETP include:

1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training
program. Used by commanders and supervisors to identify training at the appropriate point in an
Airman’s career.

1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty, and
recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.

1.3. Lists training courses available in the specialty, and identifies sources of training and the
training delivery method.

1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the optimal career
field training process.




                                                  9
2. Use of the CFETP.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop and/or revise formal resident, non-resident, field, and
exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in the
CFETP Part II. They will work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining
resources needed to provide the identified training.

2.2. MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial,
upgrade, and proficiency requirements. Resident training, OJT, contract training, or exportable
courses can satisfy identified requirements. MAJCOM unique training to support these AFSCs
must be listed in the CFETP Part II.

2.3. Commanders, supervisors and trainers will use this plan to implement comprehensive and
cohesive training programs for each individual in the specialty.

2.4. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan
based on skill level. Use the lists of courses in the CFETP Part II as a reference to support
training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the CFETP approval authority. MFMs will
identify career field training requirements and coordinate resolution with the AFCFM, HQ
AFWA, and AETC Training Managers. The AFCFM for this specialty will conduct an annual
review of this document with AETC agencies, HQ AFWA, and MFMs to ensure currency and
accuracy. The AFCFM will ensure the training resources identified in the CFETP do not result
in redundant or unnecessary training.




                                               10
Section B - Career Progression and Information

4. Specialty Description.

4.1. Specialty Summary: Manages weather operations to enable decision superiority and
application of land, air, space and cyberspace power across the full spectrum of military
operations. Activities include the collection, analysis, and forecast of atmospheric weather and
space environmental conditions.

4.2. Duties and Responsibilities. Individuals in the Weather career field collect, analyze,
predict, tailor, and integrate weather and space environmental information, including forecasts of
conditions, to provide decision-quality information on environmental impacts to Air Force,
Army, Joint and Coalition operations. They operate meteorological equipment and employ
computer workstations to interrogate current and forecast atmospheric and space weather
conditions based on observations, terrestrial and space sensing instruments, weather radars, data
and imagery from geostationary and polar orbiting satellites, and forecast data provided by
military, national, and international weather centers. Air Force weather personnel are attached or
assigned to Air Force, Army, Joint, or coalition conventional and special operations at garrison
and expeditionary locations worldwide.

5. Skill and Career Progression. Continuous training and timely progression from the
apprentice to the Chief Enlisted Manager levels are vital to the Air Force's ability to accomplish
its mission. All personnel involved in training must do their part to plan, manage, and conduct
an effective training program. This section explains how enlisted weather personnel typically
expand their responsibilities, receive training at appropriate points in their career, and progress to
each skill level. Although all personnel have a responsibility for training and development,
certain key individuals in the work center will be primarily responsible for continuously
improving skill proficiency by exploiting training opportunities. These individuals include
members of the OWS Standardization and Training Flight; commanders and supervisors; the
Unit Training Manager; individuals appointed as trainers and/or task certifiers; and the individual
trainee. Section C lists specific mandatory requirements for upgrade.

5.1. Apprentice, 3-Skill Level

5.1.1. 1W031 Apprentice. Individuals are awarded a 3-skill level upon completion of the ISC,
Weather Forecaster Apprentice Course, at Keesler AFB, MS. Apprentices are assigned to an
Operational Weather Squadron (OWS), where they will be teamed with an experienced trainer
for extensive certification, qualification and upgrade training. (Exception: National Guard
personnel proceed to the Air National Guard Weather Readiness Training Center (ANG WRTC)
at Camp Blanding, FL for qualification and upgrade training). Trainers and supervisors use
locally developed training plans (based on the STS, QTPs, and CDCs to systematically train
newly assigned apprentices in a standardized manner. Apprentices work directly with a qualified
trainer(s) to enhance task skills and knowledge. The primary task of apprentices is to complete
their task qualification and skill-level upgrade training to become certified to work as
Journeymen in designated positions on the OWS production floor or in a WF for ANG
personnel. When task certifiers certify task proficiency, apprentices may perform these tasks
without direct supervision. Apprentices should verify enrollment in the CCAF at their first duty
station.

6. Training Decisions. The intent of the AFCFM is to use a cradle-to-grave, team-centric
approach to manage utilization and training of active duty and reserve component members. Air
Staff and FOA leadership, MFMs, Course Managers, Subject Matter Experts, and AETC
Training Managers make training decisions in a combined effort using the building block
training philosophy (simple to complex). Decisions encompass the entire spectrum of training
for the weather career field and determine how, where, and when to meet training requirements,
reduce duplication, and eliminate disjointed approaches to training. To define training
requirements the CFM convenes U&TWs or TPTs, which bring all stakeholders together to make
training decisions. The most recent TPTs that prompted changes to the STS were held in
February and March 2008 and resulted in the following decisions:

6.1. Initial Skills Training. The TPT members added observation encoding requirements to the
ISC. The changes are reflected in the ISC (SOW).

                                                15
6.2 Special Operations Weather Career field and pipeline. The decision was made to separate
our special operations weathermen into a new career field (1W0X2) with a new initial skills
pipeline. The SOWT pipeline consists of 3 new courses. The Special Operations Weather
Selection Course at Lackland AFB, TX will assess and train pipeline students exiting BMT and
preparing to enter the Special Operations Weather (SOW) Initial Skills Course at Keesler AFB,
MS. The core of SOWISC is the weather ISC course. SOWISC adds routine, progressive fitness
training and is not an AFSC-awarding course. In week 29, the student will, in addition to
meeting weather course graduation requirements, complete an exit standard PT evaluation to
assess his ability to meet fitness requirements of enroute training and for the Special Operations
Weather Apprentice (SOWA) Course. After leaving Keesler AFB, the 1W012 student will
attend Airborne, SERE, Water Survival, and Underwater Egress training enroute to Pope AFB.
SOWAC is the 3–level AFSC-awarding course for 1W032 and will be where the student is
presented his beret.




                                               16
6.3. Weather Flight Detachment Operations (WFDO COURSE). This course prepares active
duty journeymen/craftsmen to perform weather observing skills, to tailor products for specialized
local support concentrating on the weather’s impact to the supported mission, and to work in
deployed environments. For graduates of the old Weather Forecaster Apprentice ISC, this
course is mandatory before being assigned to a WF for the first time. As we move Airmen
through the new ISC course and OWS training, the need for the observing portion of this course
will be eliminated. The TPT members agreed to look forward to making this course a
modularized distance learning course based on individual supported weapons systems in the
future (2-3 years).

6.4. QTPs. There were no formal changes implemented at the March 2007 U&TW.

7. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). This program provides the opportunity to
earn an Associate Degree in Applied Science, Weather Technology. CCAF automatically enrolls
BMT graduates entering the weather career track in this program. Completion of the Weather
ISC results in CCAF-creditable hours. In addition to its Associate Degree program, CCAF offers
the following:

7.1. Occupational Instructor Certification. Upon completion of instructor qualification training,
consisting of the instructor methods course and supervised practice teaching, CCAF-registered
AETC instructors who possess an Associate Degree or higher may be nominated by their school
commander/commandant for certification as an occupational instructor.

7.2. Trade Skill Certification. When CCAF students separate or retire, a trade skill certification
is awarded for their primary occupational specialty. CCAF uses a competency-based assessment
process for trade skill certification at one of four proficiency levels: apprentice, journeyman,
craftsman/supervisor, or master craftsman/manager. All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.

7.3. Degree Requirements. The Weather Technology program (8FYY) applies to AFSC
1W0XX. The ISC graduate should contact the local education office for the latest information
on semester hours earned for completing the Weather Apprentice or Weather Forecaster
Apprentice Course. Before completing an Associate Degree, the 5-level must be awarded and

Section A - Specialty Training Standard (STS)

1. Implementation. This STS:

1.1. Lists subject areas, tasks and training references common to the majority of individuals in the
Weather AFS, outlines formal technical training proficiency requirements taught by AETC, and
serves as AETC’s contract with the Weather career field. The effective date is commensurate with
the ISC/SOW class beginning 20 April 2009 and 21 April 2009 for the WFDO class.

1.2. Provides specific information on upgrade training requirements and resources.

1.3. Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System
(WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement
Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests
sample knowledge of STS subject areas judged by test development team members as most
appropriate for promotion to higher grades. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard.

1.4. When removed from the CFETP and placed in an individual’s OJT records, serves as a Job
Qualification Standard (JQS).

1.5. An AFJQS may be used in lieu of the CFETP Part II upon approval of the AFCFM. A
Command or Army Support JQS may be used in addition to the CFETP Part II upon coordination
with the AFCFM.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, the STS is an information matrix arranged by column:

2.1. Column 1. (Tasks, Knowledge, Equipment, and Technical References) identifies the most
common tasks, knowledge, equipment, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to
perform duties at the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill levels in the weather career field. It identifies the source(s)
of training or information for each task and knowledge training requirement.

2.2. Column 2. (Core Task/CBRNE) identifies core tasks required for OJT certification and tasks
that must be performed under CBRNE conditions.

2.2.1. “Core Task” column. Core tasks identified with a number corresponding to the skill level at
which the task must be certified. Those without a ^ are applicable to individuals assigned at all
units. Those with a ^ are applicable to only the 1W0X2 AFSC. Proficiency in core tasks is a basic
requirement for success in the 1W AFS. Individuals will be certified in all core tasks prior to award
of the 5-skill level (7-skill level when applicable). The core tasks requiring equipment will be
certified using the equipment available at the duty location.

2.2.2. “CBRNE” column. CBRNE tasks are identified with a “*”. Identifies tasks the tasks which
an individual must be able to perform under duress in a CBRNE environment.



                                                      26
2.3. Column 3. (Certification for OJT). When the STS is used as a JQS, Column 3 is used to record
completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements as specified in AFI 36-2201. Task
certifier initials are required for core tasks. (Note: Supervisors are mandated to use
electronic/automated training management systems (in AFW, AFTR) rather than paper records.
Training systems must include the information, and conform to the training requirements, contained
in the STS, or may be electronically linked to the STS. Training systems must be capable of
producing exportable electronic data or paper output to facilitate the transfer of training records to
gaining units.)

2.4. Column 4. (Proficiency Codes used to indicate training/information provided in formal
technical training courses). Column 4 shows the knowledge and proficiency to be demonstrated by
the trainee as a result of in-residence training or CDCs.

2.5. Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 of the STS contains the Proficiency Code Key used to
indicate the level of training and knowledge taught by in-residence technical schools and CDCs.

2.7. JQS. When the STS is used as a JQS, the following requirements apply.

2.7.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training. Identify duty position
requirements by circling the subparagraph number next to the task statement. As a minimum,
complete the following STS columns: Training Complete, Trainee Initials, Trainer Initials, and
Certifier Initials (required for core tasks). See AFI 36-2201 for detailed documentation procedures.

2.7.1.1. Certification Procedures. Supervisors, trainers and certifiers will use the STS and
procedures in AFI 36-2201 to conduct task certification. Electronic/automated training management
systems will be used to document task certification. (Note: Training systems must be capable of
producing exportable electronic data or paper output to facilitate the transfer of training records to
gaining units.)

2.7.1.1.1. Task Certification. Tasks are trained and certified to the “Go / No-Go” level. “Go”
means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local standards for accuracy,
timeliness, and correct use of equipment and procedures as required by the mission. “No-Go” means
the individual fails to meet the standards and requires more knowledge, training or practice.
MAJCOMs, strategic centers, OWSs, or WFs may develop QTPs for their unique tasks. If a QTP is
available, the trainee must complete the task-applicable portion before being task certified.

2.7.1.1.2. Duty Position Qualification. Supervisors will ensure trainees are certified on all
applicable tasks before an individual is qualified to work in a duty position without direct
supervision. If one or more core tasks are not required for the duty position, individuals may be duty
position qualified prior to being certified in all core tasks. However, individuals will not be
upgraded to the 5-skill level until all core tasks are completed. Supervisors will evaluate the need to
train or re-train tasks for position qualification each time an individual is assigned to a new duty
position or duty location.

2.7.1.2. Decertification. When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task previously certified
for his/her duty position, the supervisor erases the previous certification or deletes previous
certification when using an automated system. Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form
623a, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, to document the reason for decertification.

                                                   27
2.7.1.3. Recertification. Once the trainee completes the requirements for task certification and
receives a “Go” task evaluation, the individual may be recertified. Erase or white-out the old entries
and replace with new dates and initials, or update electronic/automated training management
systems.

2.7.1.4. Documenting Task and Subject Knowledge. For two-time CDC exam failures, task or
subject knowledge must be documented prior to requesting a CDC waiver. The supervisor identifies
all STS items corresponding to the areas covered by the failed CDC and the trainee completes a
study of the STS training references. The trainee is evaluated by the trainer (or certifier for core
tasks). If the evaluation is a “go”, the individual may be certified for the task on the STS or
electronic/automated training management systems. This does not satisfy the requirement to
complete the CDC or obtain a waiver for two-time CDC exam failures.

2.7.1.5. Converting from a Superseded CFETP to the New CFETP. Use the procedures in AFI 36-
2201 to transcribe documentation when a new CFETP is published. Electronic/automated training
management systems will be updated to include any new information and training requirements
contained in the new CFETP. Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative
function, not a re-evaluation of training. Upon completion of the transcription process, give the old
CFETP to the individual.

3. Recommending Changes or Improvements. The Training Evaluation Office at Keesler AFB,
MS, has a Customer Service Information Process (CSIP) in which students and the field can ask
questions or express concerns about formal training received. Their 24-hour Customer Service
Information Line (CSIL) is DSN 597-4566 or commercial 228-377-4566. Fax number is DSN 597-

specific task. (Examples: b and 1b)

** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific
task, or for a subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.

x This mark is used alone in course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.

^ This mark is used combined with a 5 or 7 in the core task column to identify core tasks that apply to 1W0X2 (SOWT) only.

5 This mark is used alone in the core task column to identify 5-level core tasks.

7 This mark is used alone in the core task column to identify 7-level core tasks.

Section B – Course Objective List This area is reserved.

Section C - Support Materials

4. The following list of support materials is not all-inclusive; it covers the most frequently
referenced areas.

4.1. Weather-Related Training Web Sites.

4.1.1. Primary access to career field training support materials should be the Air Force Weather
Knowledge Center (AFWKC) website maintained by HQ AFWA/A3T. This web site contains a
large amount of training materials, and hyperlinks to materials hosted by other agencies. The
goal for this website is to serve as a one-stop shopping site for AF weather training materials.

4.1.2. Some of the hyperlinks include training pages at our OWSs, weather schoolhouse,
Weather Systems Support Cadre (WSSC), 14th Weather Squadron, Air Force Combat Weather
Center (AFCWC), plus other federal government agencies and universities.

4.2. Cooperative Program for Operational Meteorology, Education, and Training
(COMET).

4.2.1. COMET is a cooperative program between the University Corporation for Atmospheric
Research (UCAR), the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the
Navy and the Air Force. AFW has been a partner for several years by contributing financial
support and receiving training modules that address the needs of the operational forecaster. A
hyperlink to COMET’s web site resides on the AFWKC web page.

4.2.2. COMET training modules are made available by HW AFWA/A3T via the AFWKC.

4.3. Video Training Tapes (1/2 inch).

4.3.1. Video training tapes are available covering a wide range of weather-related subjects.
These programs are obtained by accessing the Defense Imagery Management Operations Center
(DIMOC) online catalog. When doing a search of their online catalog, type in the subject (for
example: “weather forecasting” or “satellite imagery”) and numerous training tapes will be listed
for possible order. A DIMOC representative may be contacted at DSN 795-7283 or 7823.

4.4. Distance Learning.

4.4.1. AETC Distance Learning Programs are listed on 2nd Air Force web page
https://hq2af.keesler.af.mil/DstLearn/dl.htm and cover a wide range of subjects.

4.4.2. Other Distance Learning Programs. HQ AFWA/A3T maintains a listing of other distance
learning programs that are available for use by trainees. This list is updated periodically and
listed on the AFWKC. These are excellent modules for unit continuation training.
