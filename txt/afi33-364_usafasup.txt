Table 5.1.
Note 6: Permission is granted for offices of record to retain small volumes of 2-year records in
their current files until eligible for disposal or retirement provided additional filing equipment is
not required. If reference requirements justify, submit a request for a waiver to retain other
records in the current file area for the full retention period of up to 8 years. Submit the request,
using the format at Attachment 4, through your Functional Area Records Manager (FARM) to
the USAFA Base Records Manager. Approved waiver must be revalidated every 2 years.

the history of the USAF Academy must be made available for microfilming or Digital Scanning
and inclusion in the holdings of the Special Collections Division (HQ USAFA/DFLIB/SPC).
These documents include, but are not limited to, precedent files, special projects, and other
documents      reflecting   policy formulation.        Record    Custodians     will   notify
HQ USAFA/DFLIB/SPC of any documents that may fall into this category. Personnel from
HQ USAFA/DFLIB/SPC will review the documents and, if considered of value, charge them out
from the office of record, have them microfilmed, and return them in their original file
arrangement to the office of record.
5.10.1. Upon expiration of the retention period, process exposed X-rays and other types of film
which have been determined to contain recoverable precious metal in accordance with AFMAN

7.2.2.1. Accountability must always be maintained when transferring records from one office of
record to another. The transferring office will prepare a staging request through AFRIMS. The
transferring office will obtain a signature from the receiving office in block 4 of the SF 135 and

8.3.1. White Tuck Bottom Boxes (NSN 8115-00-117-8249) will be used for records placed in
