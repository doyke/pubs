SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is a major revision and must be reviewed entirely. It includes initial guidance for the new
Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) career field (AFSC 1P0X1), which includes and merges the
former Aircrew Life Support (AFSC 1T1X1) and Survival Equipment (AFSC 2A7X4) career
fields. It modifies MAJCOM and other agency responsibilities, and updates office symbols.
Life Support Officers (LSO) are referred to as Flight Equipment Officers (FEO). Previous
guidance relating to Mobility, CBRN, and contingency operations has been moved to AFI 11-
301, Volume 3, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Combat Operations, (forthcoming).

Program Guidance Letter (PGL), Aircrew Life Support and Survival Equipment Career
Field Merger, dated 12 March 2008 implemented the Chief of Staff of the Air Force direction
to merge these two career fields, and created a new AFE (AFSC 1P0X1) career field with all
functions, manpower, and personnel organizationally aligned to the Operations Support
Squadron (OSS) under the Operations Group (OG) to include all military, civil service, and

      AIRCREW FLIGHT EQUIPMENT CONTINUATION TRAINING (AFECT)

5.1. Purpose. AFECT consists of ground training events (not ancillary training) listed in Table
5.1 of this instruction and is provided for each aircrew member, designated non-rated personnel,
and passengers to refresh and enhance their proficiency and knowledge in all AFECT events.
This chapter establishes specific requirements and applies to all AFECT Instructors (AFECTI),
aircrew and personnel who fly. Training equipment will be configured to mirror operational
equipment and all training will be realistic, hands-on and student centered to the maximum
extent possible. This is the standard method for developing aircrew proficiency. AFECT will be
conducted in a distraction-free facility/environment.
5.2. Responsibilities:
   5.2.1. AFECT will be conducted IAW Table 5.1 of this instruction. MAJCOMs will
   supplement this instruction to tailor AFECT courses to fulfill their specific requirements. The
   361 TRS/TRR will update their AFE Air Force Master Lesson Plans (AFMLP) based on
   current safety information provided by the Air Force Safety Center and MAJCOMs. AFE
   Superintendent/FEO, upon notification from their MAJCOMs, will download the update
   information         from          the      AFE          AFMLP              CoP         website:
   https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=AE-OP-00-01.
   5.2.2. AFECT instructors may be an FEO, qualified instructor aircrew, or AFE (1P0X1)
   training instructor. MAJCOMs and ANG units will supplement this instruction with
   requirements for assigning and certifying AFECT instructors.
       5.2.2.1. Emergency egress training will be taught by a FEO (rated officer) or by an
       appointed rated officer and qualified instructor aircrew designated in writing by the group
       FEO. EXCEPTION: Civil service and contractor equivalent may conduct AFECT
       course(s) if specifically hired for that purpose and ANG AFECTIs.
           5.2.2.1.1. (Added-PACAF) AFE Continuation Training Instructors (AFECTI)
           (including C-12, C-37 and C-40) must be recommended and appointed by the
           commander to include AFEO and AFES. AFE personnel will not teach ESA egress
           with the exception of Air National Guard units. The AFES can provide certification if
           the FEO is not available to certify additional pilots.
           5.2.2.1.2. (Added-PACAF) AFES will perform initial certification of FEO and
           AFECT instructors using objectives defined in the Instructor Guides (IG). AFES will
           recertify all instructors (a minimum of one class) not to exceed 18-month intervals.
           All instructor evaluations will be documented using IMT AETC 281, Instructor
           Evaluation Checklist. ANG organizations can allow full time AFE Supervisors to
           evaluate AFE, CTI’s. Not applicable to AFRC.
           5.2.2.1.3. (Added-PACAF) All heavy type aircraft instructor aircrew members will
           be considered egress certified instructors. The AFE will be responsible to ensure a
           current syllabus is used.
AFI11-301V1_PACAFSUP_I 12 APRIL 2012                                                          55

   5.3.4. Aircrew Chemical Defense Training (ACDT) (LL04): An academic and equipment
   training session in which the aircrew member demonstrates and performs donning, doffing,
   and buddy dressing procedures using either the first or second generation ACDE or Aircrew
   Eye/Respiratory Protection (AERP) equipment. This training also includes information on
   hazards and limitations of wearing the equipment properly and improperly, preflight
   procedures, aircraft integration, and parachute descent emergency procedures. Each aircrew
   will demonstrate procedures during their initial class; subsequent classes require a minimum
   of 10% of aircrew participants to dress out and demonstrate ACCA decontamination
   processing procedures.
   5.3.5. Egress Training with ACDE (LL05): Evaluates the aircrew’s ability to demonstrate
   proficiency in the use of primary as well as secondary air and ground egress procedures
   while wearing ACDE. Training will stress the unique changes in procedures to include added
   difficulties aircrew would and could experience as a result of wearing ACDE.

   5.3.6. Aircrew Flight Equipment Training (AFET) (LL06) (formerly Aircrew Life Support
   Equipment [ALSE] Training): An academic and equipment training event, in which aircrew
   members demonstrate their ability to locate, preflight, and use all aircrew and passenger AFE
   carried aboard unit aircraft or issued to aircrew members. This training includes the
   limitations and safety issues related to AFE. Additionally, include aircrew clothing items and
   information on hazards associated with improper wear and failure to use only authorized
   clothing and equipment items.
   5.3.7. With the exception of ARC, AFMC, and AFSPC units, which do not have SERE
   (1T0X1) personnel assigned, AFE sections are not authorized or manned to conduct the Code
   of Conduct/SERE training outlined in AFI 16-1301, Survival Evasion Resistance Escape
   (SERE) Operations.
      5.3.7.1. (Added-PACAF) SERE Training events SS01 through SS08 are the
      responsibility of the wing or group SERE Specialist. AFE instructors will not participate
      in Resistance Training (RT) refresher training (SS03 Conduct After Capture and SS07
      High Risk of Capture). If SERE Specialist is unavailable to train these courses,
      coordinate this training with the PACAF SERE Functional Manager through
      PACAF/A3TC.
   5.3.8. (Added-PACAF) AFES will ensure all types of AFE equipment are available and
   presented during LL06. Perform TCTO or modifications on all training equipment to ensure
   it mirrors and functions the same as operational equipment.
   5.3.9. (Added-PACAF) If AFE ―LL‖ event objectives are taught and met during SS events,
   units are authorized to give credit for the LL event, as long as objectives are taught at the
   same intervals. To maximize course and aircrew time availability, AFES will review all local
   AFECT Instructor Guides and ensure objectives and information is not repeated in other
   courses, such as in SERE events (SS Courses) or CE Readiness and Emergency Management
   events (ground crew chemical defense). The AFES will coordinate with other functional
   areas to ensure objectives are taught in appropriate course(s).
5.4. Formal Training Requirements:
   5.4.1. All aircrew members must attend formal training requirements as identified in AFI 16-
   1301.
   5.4.2. All AFECT instructors must meet the minimum formal training requirements
   contained in Table 4.1 of this instruction and be assigned using guidelines established by
   respective MAJCOMs.
   5.4.3. To obtain formal supplemental course allocations for AFE personnel, forward the full
   name, rank, Social Security Number (SSN), and organization of personnel requiring training
   to the appropriate MAJCOM AFE focal point at least 60 days in advance of the requested
   training date. AFRC and ANG will request quotas IAW AFRC and ANG procedures.
      5.4.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Requests will be forwarded to MAJCOM NLT 1 November
      each year.
   5.4.4. The group FEO or AFE superintendent will control and manage the wing’s AFE
   formal supplemental course allocations. Cancellations or substitutions will be accomplished
   by contacting the appropriate MAJCOM or ANG AFE focal point not later than 30 days prior
AFI11-301V1_PACAFSUP_I 12 APRIL 2012                                                           57


   to class start date. Return all allocations that cannot be used to the appropriate MAJCOM or
   ANG AFE focal point for redistribution at least 30 days prior to class start date.
5.5. AFECT Requirements:
   5.5.1. Minimum Training Requirements. Table 5.1 of this instruction specifies the required
   AFECT events and frequencies for aircrew members and passengers.
   5.5.2. Failure to accomplish AFECT at the required intervals IAW AFI 11-2MDS-series,
   Vol 1/Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) tasking memo, will result in grounding or non-combat
   mission ready status.
   5.5.3. If an aircrew member, current in all AFECT events, is TDY to perform flying duties to
   a location where a training capability does not exist and the individual becomes due in an
   AFECT event, training must be accomplished before first flight at home station. AFRC and
   ANG FMs will determine time frame required to complete training upon arrival at home
   station.
   5.5.4. Emergency Egress and Parachute Descent Training (PDT) should be given
   concurrently when practical (ejection or non-ejection aircraft).
      5.5.4.1. (Added-PACAF) For non-ejection aircraft this training may be given during
      LL06 if the training environment permits. The SERE Specialist will provide Emergency
      Parachute Training as directed by AFI 16-1301. See AFI for specific objectives.
   5.5.5. Flight Surgeons will receive AFECT at frequencies determined IAW MDS-specific
   guidance.
      5.5.5.1. (Added-PACAF) If not covered by specific MDS guidance, flight surgeons will
      receive egress once every 90 days on primary assigned aircraft. The FEO may waive this
      requirement up to 180 days for those flight surgeons who demonstrate proficiency in the
      aircraft on a case-by-case basis. Heavy aircraft unit flight surgeons will follow MDS
      aircrew member requirements.
   5.5.6. Aircrew members arriving PCS or visiting aircrews, such as those assigned to the
   inspector general, test squadrons, etc., are not required to re-accomplish egress or PDT if
   source documentation of currency can be obtained (e.g., ARMS) and they are current in the
   assigned aircraft. However, training on local unit specific AFE and rescue requirements will
   be accomplished.
   5.5.7. Aircrew members previously qualified in a given ejection seat equipped aircraft and
   currently in transition to a different model of the aircraft, or undergoing upgrade training in
   the same type of aircraft, may receive egress training at the regular interval from date last
   accomplished, if the escape systems and procedures are the same in both aircraft models.
   5.5.8. Aircrew members in transition from one type of ejection seat equipped aircraft to
   another and awaiting a Fighter Training Unit (FTU) slot will receive Emergency Egress and
   PDT at intervals determined by respective MAJCOM.

   5.5.11. An aircrew member may be credited with ACDT (LL04) during local operational
   readiness exercises provided all AFECT requirements and objectives are satisfied (i.e.
   crewmember donned chemical defense ensemble and subsequently processed through
   ACCA).
5.6. AFECT Safety. Safety is paramount when planning and conducting AFECT. As a
minimum, the following will apply:
   5.6.1. The group FEO or AFE superintendent, with assistance from the local safety office,
   will ensure ORM or other risk management programs or techniques are fully implemented,
   documented in unit lesson plans (LP), and tailored to their specific operation and location for
   all AFECT events.
   5.6.2. The AFE superintendent will develop and publish an Emergency Action Plan (EAP)
   for use during any training event where injury is likely, (e.g., AFE class if signal flares are
   activated). The EAP will be included in the unit LP, briefed by the lead instructor prior to
   each training event, and understood by every instructor and student prior to event start.
5.7. Passenger and Incentive Flyer Training:
   5.7.1. Passengers scheduled for flight aboard ejection seat equipped aircraft will receive, as a
   minimum, emergency egress, PDT, and AFE training no earlier than 72 hours prior to flight.
   If the 72 hours are exceeded before flight, training will be re-accomplished. Emergency
   egress training includes cockpit familiarization, use of oxygen/communication controls and
   switches, and manual bailout procedures training, if applicable.
      5.7.1.1. Incentive/FAM riders flying over water beyond gliding distance to land will also
      receive water survival academics and hands on training with life preservers/life rafts.
   5.7.2. Non-rated personnel who fly occasionally to perform official duties (e.g., enroute
   ground support, security, etc.) will receive emergency egress, PDT, and AFE training at
   intervals determined by respective MAJCOM.

   briefing.
   5.7.4. (Added-PACAF) For taxi rides see AFI 11-401, Aviation Management.
5.8. Training Documentation:
   5.8.1. All completed AFECT events will be documented on AF IMT 1522, ARMS Additional
   Training Accomplishment Report, or equivalent and maintained as a record of class
   attendance IAW AFI 37-139. Only those event identifiers shown in Table 5.1 of this
   instruction will be used to identify AFECT events.
   5.8.2. Upon completion of training, one or more rosters will be signed by the instructor and
   forwarded to appropriate office for input into ARMS. The OSS AFE Flight staff will keep a
   duplicate copy of the rosters on file.
   5.8.3. Instructors will provide written documentation to individuals who are from another
   unit (i.e., Inspector General, HHQs staff, and visiting aircrews) so their records can be
   updated at home station.
   5.8.4. FTU and Basic Fighter Training (BFT) student rosters will be maintained until
   graduation.
   5.8.5. AFE is not responsible for maintaining ARMS or managing and tracking aircrew
   training status for AFECT events in ARMS.
5.9. Training Aids and Equipment:
   5.9.1. Emergency ground and air egress and ejection seat training will be accomplished
   using the appropriate Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) when available or the actual aircraft
   only when an EPT is not available. Non-ejection seat egress training will be conducted using
   actual aircraft to the maximum extent possible.
   5.9.2. Units may use the actual aircraft installed ejection seat for egress training when
   designated training devices are not available provided all ejection seats are made safe by
   qualified egress personnel.
   5.9.3. For ACDT and egress training, aircrew members are required to wear all clothing and
   AFE items typically worn during contingency operations unless specifically prohibited by
   this instruction.
   5.9.4. AFECT instructors will inspect training devices and aids prior to use to ensure they
   are properly configured, safe, and operational for training. The AFE superintendent or their
   designated representative will perform annual inspections of all AFE training devices and
   aids to ensure they are current and safe for training use. This includes displays, ACDE, AFE,
   and personnel lowering devices. Inspections will be documented appropriately.
      5.9.4.1. (Added-PACAF) EPT inspections (prior to use, monthly, annually) will be
      documented in AF IMT 781, or equivalent (i.e. ALSMS, AFTO Form 244).
   5.9.5. Training equipment will mirror operational equipment to the maximum extent
   possible. Equipment used for training will be clearly marked ―FOR TRAINING USE
   ONLY‖ and stored to prevent co-mingling with operational equipment. When training
   equipment does not exist (i.e., night vision devices, combat survival radios, etc.), MAJCOMs
 60                                            AFI11-301V1_PACAFSUP_I 12 APRIL 2012


   may designate the use of operational equipment for training as long as the training does not
   damage or destroy the integrity of the equipment.
5.10. Lesson Plans Development Guidance:
   5.10.1. AFECT Air Force Master Lesson Plans. AFMLPs are documents developed to
   prescribe instructional requirements, teaching points, and instructor-student activities
   essential to the accomplishment of training objectives for all AFECT. AFMLPs are designed
   to include the minimum training requirements and are essential for supervisors and
   instructors to ensure lesson objectives are completed.
   5.10.2. Only approved AFMLPs developed by the 361 TRS/TRR AFE CDC Writer,
   Sheppard AFB, TX will be used to conduct AFECT. The AFMLPs, developed by the 361
   TRS/TRR, are complete and ready be downloaded once they have been approved by Lead
   MDS MAJCOM. Units should delete information from the AFMLPs that does not pertain to
   their mission or unit. MAJCOMs will use AFMLPs developed by the 361 TRS/TRR.
   Furthermore, ARC units that have AFECTIs who are solely responsible for conducting code
   of conduct continuation training events will only use lesson plans approved by AFRC/A3TS
   or NGB/A3OS.
   5.10.3. The FEO or AFE superintendent must tailor down the AFMLP and produce an
   AFECT Master Lesson Plan (MLP) to meet their wings mission needs. AFECT MLP are un-
   personalized lesson plans used for control and standardization within an organization or unit
   that has been developed from the AFMLP by deleting unnecessary information based on a
   units equipment or MDS. Group FEO/AFE superintendents who identify a need for a new
   AFMLP will forward request to MAJCOMs or Lead MDS MAJCOM for review of new
   requirement(s). Approved requests will be forwarded, and all data from Subject Matter
   Expert (SME) for development of AFMLP to 361 TRS/TRR AFE CDC Writer, Sheppard
   AFB, TX.
   5.10.4. AFECT LP. Lesson plans are documents developed from the AFECT MLP and
   prepared for use by each instructor to organize and present information. A personalized
   lesson plan contains information to aid the instructor. This is accomplished by writing
   personal instructional notes and material on the right-hand side of the AFECT MLP. The
   lesson plan must be validated with approved reference materials that can be produced upon
   request.
   5.10.5. All AFE MLPs and AFECT LPs used to conduct AFECT will be reviewed annually
   by the group FEO or AFE superintendent. Annual reviews will be documented as directed by
   individual MAJCOMs.
      5.10.5.1. (Added-PACAF) Annual reviews will be documented on lesson plan cover
      page.
   5.10.6. Higher headquarters correspondence (e.g., messages, Flight Crew Information Files
   [FCIF], etc.) directing the inclusion of information not covered in AFECT AFMLPs or lesson
   plans will be added as directed by the 361 TRS/TRR.
   5.10.7. Designated Lead MAJCOM MDS SMEs will assist the 361 TRS/TRR in validating
   AFMLPs biennially during the World Wide AFE Workshop MAJCOM breakouts. If more
   frequent reviews are deemed necessary; the requesting MAJCOM will coordinate and fund
AFI11-301V1_PACAFSUP_I 12 APRIL 2012                                                           61


   for the CDC Writer to attend MAJCOM conference to accomplish the review with SMEs.
   The 361 TRS will notify the MAJCOMS of any changes to the AFMLPs and group
   FEO/AFE superintendent will update their MLPs upon notification by their MAJCOMs.

              AUTOMATED LIFE-SUSTAINING EQUIPMENT RECORDS

6.1. Overview. The ALERTS and APWEB are automated global data management systems
developed to allow ―total asset visibility‖ of AFE items and associated documentation processes.
ALERTS is capable of supporting the entire AFE community to automate the data management
processes for most inspection, training, supply, and administration documents. The vision of
ALERTS is to provide the ability and means of improving the performance methods and
administration needs of the AFE community and support agencies using current COTS hardware,
software, and the military (.mil) network.
6.2. Automated Document and Management Systems:
   6.2.1. ALERTS. Once fully fielded, ALERTS will be used by all AFE functions within the
   Air Force IAW this chapter and MAJCOM supplements thereto. ALERTS Computer Based
   Training (CBT) is a mandatory training requirement prior to any individual using ALERTS
   in all organizations.
       6.2.1.1. (Added-PACAF) ALSMS/FERMS is the designated data management system
       for use by PACAF.
   6.2.2. ALSMS. ALSMS is a management tool used by AFE personnel. AFE units are
   authorized to continue using the ALSMS program to best suit their needs until they are
   designated by their MAJCOMS to be upgraded to ALERTS. Units tracking AFE items with
   the ALSMS program are not required to duplicate the data maintained in the computer on
   status boards, shop inspection cards, or forms. AFE superintendents will standardize
   equipment tracking methods within their respective groups.
   6.2.3. Aircrew       Protection    Website      (APWEB)         can     be   accessed    at:
   https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/DOTL/UnitData/UnitDataHomeFrame.cfm. All
   units that are not using ALERTS will use APWEB to document their end item data IAW the
   APWEB user manual. Each unit will provide all relevant data on each item to include;
   contract numbers, lot numbers, dates of manufacture, dates of expiration, back order
   quantities, off-base requisition numbers, and quantities deployed. The data contained within
   this site must be complete, verified, and validated by their respective MAJCOM prior to the
   unit being upgraded to ALERTS.
       6.2.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Stock records will have all pertinent data input into ALSMS
       (i.e. Contract Numbers, Lot Numbers, Dates of Manufacture, Installation, and Expiration,

6.4. ALERTS General Areas:
   6.4.1. Requesting Modifications or New Capabilities:
      6.4.1.1. Purpose.     ALERTS serves as the single focal point program in the
      documentation of all AFE processes. To meet the rapidly changing needs of the AFE
      community, the following process will be used to manage requests for modifications and
      new ALERTS capabilities outside of the scope of the current support contract. This
      process is described below.
      6.4.1.2. Changes to Policy/Procedure Documents and or ALERTS Processes.           The
      identifying user will accomplish the following:
          6.4.1.2.1. Provide a written proposal of the complete suggested process to their
          MAJCOM FM.
          6.4.1.2.2. The MAJCOM FM will validate the need and forward the proposed
          process to the Air Force ALERTS OPR.
          6.4.1.2.3. The Air Force ALERTS OPR will forward the proposal to the support
          contractor for evaluation.
          6.4.1.2.4. The support contractor will evaluate the proposed process and determine
          the technical feasibility.
          6.4.1.2.5. If the need is technically feasible, the Air Force ALERTS OPR will
          validate and forward to all using commands for their input. MAJCOM ALERTS
          POCs have 10 working days to evaluate proposals. Negative replies are required. If
          the need applies to only the proposing command, the Air Force ALERTS OPR will
          validate the need and proceed to the next step.
             6.4.1.2.5.1. If all MAJCOMs’ POCs do not agree, the proposal will be forwarded
             to HQ USAF/A3O-AT for final resolution.
             6.4.1.2.5.2. If all ALERTS MAJCOMs’ POCs agree, the support contractor will
             determine the cost for development and implementation.

         6.4.1.2.6. Once the technical feasibility and cost analysis are received, the proposal
         will be forwarded to the APWG and APEC for final determination and a funding
         solution.
             6.4.1.2.6.1. If approved and funding has been secured, the Air Force ALERTS
             OPR will initiate the development and implementation process.
             6.4.1.2.6.2. If disapproved, the submitting command will be notified by the Air
             Force ALERTS OPR and or the APEC of their decision and rationale for
             disapproval.
  6.4.2. Software Problem Report (SPR):
     6.4.2.1. Users will submit SPRs through the established procedures contained in
     APWEB or ALERTS websites. Users should contact their local Work Group Managers
     to validate there is not connectivity problems locally before contacting the help desk or
     submitting an SPR. There are 3 types of SPRs, which are described as follows: NOTE:
     The inability to connect or a slow response from the APWEB or ALERTS servers does
     not constitute a problem with these systems.
         6.4.2.1.1. Category 1. An identified requirement is nonfunctional.
         6.4.2.1.2. Category 2. An identified requirement is nonfunctional, but there is a valid

  this instruction and Attachment 2 for implementing the AF AFE AIT barcode marking
  standard for AFE supplies.
  6.4.4. Standards.
     6.4.4.1. Nomenclature Standard. To ensure a common standard for nomenclatures
     within ALERTS, units will use the technical order IPBs or manufacturer’s manuals when
     establishing items. Items or equipment not addressed in IPBs, formal technical orders, or
     manuals will be assigned a nomenclature by 77 AESG or 642 CBSG.
     6.4.4.2. Air Force Kit/Aircraft Configuration Naming Standards. To ensure global data
     reporting capability, units will use the identified standards contained within ALERTS.
     Request additional templates IAW paragraph 6.4.1 of this Instruction.
     6.4.4.3. Item Supply Detail Data. All relevant data on these screens will be tracked by
     all AFE units. If the data is not available units will use the standard established below for
     all unknown data fields.
  6.4.5. Data Entry Standards:
AFI11-301V1_PACAFSUP_I 12 APRIL 2012                                                          67


      6.4.5.1. Within APWEB, units attempting to enter data that is unavailable will use
      ―UNK‖ for unknown text fields, and 01/01/1900 for unknown date fields. All unknown
      data fields that are not mandatory will be left blank.
      6.4.5.2. Within ALERTS, all unknown data fields not mandatory will be left blank. For
      mandatory fields, units will use the APWEB standard.
      6.4.5.3. All contract number and lot number entries must include the full contract and lot
      number and be entered into ALERTS exactly as they appear on the item. This will
      ensure there is no confusion when data is recalled.
   6.4.6. LOGIN Standard for AFE Personnel and Aircrew. LOGIN standard is case sensitive
   and includes the last name, first initial, and last six numbers of individual’s SSN. AFE units
   must scan the one-dimensional bar code on the backside of the aircrew’s military
   identification card for the ALERTS login.
   6.4.7. APWEB and ALERTS Data Protection; For Official Use Only (FOUO):
      6.4.7.1. Reports generated from APWEB/ALERTS will be considered FOUO, unless
      otherwise marked, and must be protected IAW DoD and AF instructions.
      6.4.7.2. Reports containing personnel data, i.e., SSN will have the privacy act statement
      affixed.
      6.4.7.3. Aircraft tail number location in ALERTS must use the last six digits as the
      standard (EXAMPLE: 99-0011). This will allow full integration of the new automated
      forecasting system and the requirements established by 84 MUSG/GJ (OO-ALC) for
      properly tracking and forecasting time change items for replacement.
   6.4.8. Configuration Data File (CDF) Process:
      6.4.8.1. The CDF established for accountable equipment items will be maintained in
      AFEMS IAW AFMAN 23-110. Accountable and non-accountable equipment end item
      authorizations will be documented and maintained in APWEB/ALERTS. Air Staff,
      MAJCOMs, and 77 AESG when experiencing acquisition difficulties, may direct units to
      document authorizations and on-hand quantities within these programs.
6.5. ALERTS Operations Areas:
   6.5.1. Aircraft Accident Data Records. Upon notification from a competent authority, the
   AFE superintendent, squadron system administrator, or AFE NCOIC will freeze all AFE
   records for equipment involved in a mishap. To ensure data fidelity for the safety review
   board, these records will remain frozen until such time as determined by the involved
   MAJCOM Staff Judge Advocate or delegated authority. Once authority has been granted,
   the AFE superintendent will notify the contractor help desk to unfreeze the records.
   6.5.2. Data Review Requirement. AFE superintendents and NCOICs or designated
   individual will review APWEB and ALERTS to validate data accuracy every 180 days.
   6.5.3. CTK Procedures. AFE specialized equipment used on the flightline will be marked
   and managed IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and
   Chapter 3 of this instruction.

  6.5.4. Equipment Accountability. ALERTS specialized equipment will be marked and
  managed IAW AFI 33-112, Computer Systems Management.
  6.5.5. ALERTS Data Record Transfer Process:
     6.5.5.1. Units using ALERTS to transfer equipment, personnel, or aircraft records to
     other ALERTS enabled units will use the ALERTS electronic data transfer process.
     6.5.5.2. Units using ALERTS to transfer equipment, personnel, or aircraft records to
     non-ALERTS enabled units will still use the ALERTS electronic data transfer process.
     However, the information will be stored under a general identified Personnel Accounting
     System (PAS) code until the receiving unit comes online with ALERTS. The sending
     unit will also provide paper copies of all required forms.
  6.5.6. AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, Process. AFE units with ALERTS fully
  implemented can use ALERTS in lieu of the AF IMT 1297 to transfer responsibility of the
  item. MAJCOMs may implement more restrictive accountability procedures as required.
  6.5.7. Contact Memory Button (CMB) Processes and Mounting. MAJCOMs will develop
  their own implementation process for units using the CMB.
  6.5.8. Interaction with Mobility Inventory Control & Accountability System (MICAS). Air
  Staff or MAJCOM will provide the APWEB or ALERTS data associated with MICAS to
  data managers when requested through these programs.
  6.5.9. Deployment and Multi-Command or Multi-Unit Operations:
     6.5.9.1. Units will use the guidance in the ALERTS user and process manuals for these
     operations. Units who do not have any ALERTS specialized equipment or are not
     connected to the ALERTS site while deployed will refer to paragraph 6.5.10 for
     documentation procedures.
     6.5.9.2. Non-ALERTS units, or units not using CMB, which service multi-place aircraft
     will preposition a copy of all AFE items inspection records on the aircraft prior to all
     deployments.
  6.5.10. Units will develop documentation procedures to update ALERTS data when
  connectivity is not available or if they do not have the necessary hardware to use ALERTS in
  the unconnected mode. This will include all maintenance actions, QA, and any other actions.
  6.5.11. DoD, Air Force and AFTO Forms/IMT, and Other Documentation (NL555, Battery
  Inspection Label) Within the Sections/Shops. Units implementing ALERTS do not have to
  use serviceability tags to identify equipment in service, storage, or otherwise used unless
  specifically required in AFMAN 23-110 or required by Air Force technical orders. Units
  will use condition code tags when turning in equipment to supply IAW AFMAN 23-110.
  MAJCOMs may implement more restrictive accountability procedures to distinguish
  serviceability of equipment as required.
  6.5.12. ALERTS will use a single type of inspection record for all AFE items when
  applicable.
  6.5.13. AF Form 623 (Automated). ALERTS is the primary electronic equivalent authorized
  means to provide the capability to electronically track all AFE technician training.
  MAJCOMS will develop an implementation process for using the electronic ALERTS AF
AFI11-301V1_PACAFSUP_I 12 APRIL 2012                                                 69

BOI requirement for the bags maintained.

6. One M295 Kit consist of 4 each M295 Mitts.

7. Bulk Store M295 Decon Kits in their original unopened containers. Packages will only be
opened and distributed when directed to do so by command authority (i.e. installation
commander, MAJCOM directives, SPINS, etc.).

8. Only 1 filter is required per bag when used with the MBU-13/P mask.

8.7. (PACAF) Deployment Operations/Mobility Preparation.
   8.7.1. (PACAF) Configure aircraft-installed and aircrew-issued AFE, survival vests, and
   parachutes for contingency operations. All aircrew will have their individual AFE combat
   configured, prior to the first employment mission.
   8.7.2. (PACAF) Mobility bins and boxes will be available for storage and deployment of
   AFE.
   8.7.3. (PACAF) Units will maintain sufficient quantities of technical data, tools, equipment
   repair parts, and supplies to support surge-type operations under bare-base conditions for a
   minimum of 90 days without resupply. Sufficient test equipment must be available to meet
   deployment commitments and have current calibrations documented. In addition, units may
   establish War Reserve Material (WRM) for swing stock IAW AFI 25-101, War Reserve
   Materiel (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures.
AFI11-301V1_PACAFSUP_I 12 APRIL 2012                                                       85


   8.7.4. (PACAF) Include portable or deployable equipment racks, work benches, storage
   bins, computers, etc., in the contingency package (LOGDET). Facility considerations (stand-
   up shop) will include all AFE storage and maintenance requirements.
   8.7.5. (PACAF) Complete a detailed packing list and diagram for each mobility bin or box.
   Ensure packing list is ―user‖ friendly so all AFE personnel may find equipment and supplies
   stored in bin or box.
   8.7.6. (PACAF) Prepackage equipment and supplies designated for contingency
   commitments to the maximum extent at all times. Secure and store assets and tone-down
   equipment IAW AFI 25-101. Do not use these assets as a source of supply for daily
   peacetime operations at home-station.
   8.7.7. (PACAF) Establish weapons and ammunition issue, receipt, accountability, and
   control procedures IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, and
   AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual, as appropriate. Record information on
   AF Form 629, Small Arms Hand Receipt, AF Form 1297, or a master control roster. Any
   deviations to weapons issue procedures must be approved IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use
   of Force by Air Force Personnel Protect weapons under field conditions IAW AFH 31-223.
8.8. (PACAF) Deployment of Inspection Records.
   8.8.1. (PACAF) Establish procedures to ensure AFE records accompany the deployed AFE
   personnel.
8.9. (PACAF) Aircrew Chemical Defense.
   8.9.1. (PACAF) Establish procedures to ensure deploying aircrew hand-carry at least one
   complete ACDE/AERP ensemble (D-1 mini bag).
      8.9.1.1. (PACAF) Carefully package ACDE/AERP equipment components to prevent
      damage.
   8.9.2. (PACAF) Should staffing requirements and mission needs dictate, deployable
   augmentee resources may be trained in shelter operations and ACCA processing; however,
   they will not be trained or assigned in a capacity requiring AFE technical expertise (AFSC
   1P0X1).
   8.9.3. (PACAF) Aircrew ACDE/AERP ensemble sizes. AFE units must deploy with crew
   members’ individual ACDE/AERP ensemble size information to give AFE personnel the
   capability to requisition sized items as necessary for deployed aircrew. Units may develop
   local procedures to provide crew members their individual size information to have on their
   person while deployed.

                                          Attachment 2
AIR FORCE STANDARD AFE AUTOMATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (AIT)
                       BARCODE MARKING

Contractors and suppliers for all AFE systems to include subcomponents shall use bar code
nameplates, labels, or direct part markings IAW DoD MIL-STD-130 Change 1, DoD UID
Guide, and this document. Use of an advanced part marking technology like bar codes and 2D
symbols is essential to the AFE community being able to facilitate automated ―removal and
replace‖ features of automated programming and product support/maintenance. Exceptions to
use of machine-readable nameplates will be considered, on a case-by-case basis, in accordance
with practical or good business sense (e.g., part too small for nameplate, part immersed in fuel
tank, etc.). AFE will consider other advanced part marking technology should they become
commercially practicable, driven by DoD requirements, and or advantageous to the government
in the future.

Marking Requirements.

Human Readable Information (HRI) and Machine Readable Information (MRI) are required for
current AIT systems to provide the necessary advances in efficiency. Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and the DoD has mandated the use of Data Matrix
ECC 200 as the standard format for UID MRI markings. Overarching guidance for the construct
and application of Data Matrix markings is contained in MIL-STD-130 and DoD UID Guide
located at www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/UID. Specific examples are given here for manufactures and
suppliers for implementation.

AFE has three different situations that require or can require different markings and they are:

a. UID Serialized Lot Batch; Items controlled with serial numbers and lot numbers
b. UID Serialized Data Stream; Items controlled with serial numbers only
c. Non UID/Non Serialized Lot Batch; Items that do not meet the UID requirement and are not
controlled with serial numbers.

See figures 1 – 6 for specific examples of the labels and data streams.

HRI Marking Requirements. The following HRI data is required (as a minimum):

- Manufacturer’s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, 5 alpha/numeric characters

- Item Lot Number

           NOTE: The Lot Number MUST be unique within the manufacturer’s
           CAGE (Lot Numbers cannot be repeated on other part numbers)

- Item Serial Number
 102                                            AFI11-301V1_PACAFSUP_I 12 APRIL 2012


           NOTE: Air Force contracts typically require 5 digit serial numbers
           (minimum), sequentially assigned, not to be repeated until serial number
           99,999 has been reached

- Item manufacturer’s Part Number

           NOTE: The weapon system Specification Number does not meet this
           requirement

- Contract Number (CNCT#), 13 alpha/numeric characters

- Date of Manufacture; Year and Day of manufacture in Julian Date format

           NOTE: Markings and/or attachments shall make no reference to item
           installation requirements/procedures or shelf/service lives.

MRI Data Construct.

Data Matrix ECC200 markings shall be developed based on UID Data Construct #2 using Data
Identifiers (DIs) in accordance with MIL-STD-130 and the DoD UID Guide (see Figure 2). To
facilitate durability throughout the scanning life cycle, the largest symbol size, including quiet
zone, shall be fitted within the available marking real estate. The symbol’s internal module (cell)
sizes shall be no smaller than 0.0075 inch (0.19 mm) and no larger than 0.025 inch (0.64 mm).
Marks shall contain only the data elements identified below:

           NOTE: The parentheses surrounding the Data Identifier are NOT encoded in the 2D
           symbol.

- (17V) Manufacturer’s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, 5 alpha/numeric
characters.

- (1T) Item production Lot Number, IAW HRI requirement, Maximum 20 alpha/numeric,
including special characters (- or/).

           NOTE: The lot number MUST be unique within the manufacturer’s CAGE
           (Lot Numbers cannot be repeated on other part numbers)

- (S) Item Serial Number, IAW HRI requirement, Maximum 20 alpha/numeric including special
characters (- or/).

- (1P) Manufacturer’s Item Part Number, Maximum 20 alpha/numeric including special
characters (- or/).

           NOTE: The weapon system Specification Number does not meet this
           requirement.

                  PACAF AFE QUALITY CONTROL (QC) PROGRAM

Note: (Added) Not applicable to AFRC/ANG units. AFRC/ANG will provide separate
guidance and/or an attachment to this AFI supplement with respective AFE QC program
guidance/requirements.
A3.1. (Added-PACAF) General. The PACAF AFE QC program is a supplement to guidance
previously provided in this AFI. It encompasses most QC activity for the AFE program and
ensures all equipment and vital programs are adequately inspected. This ensures only the highest
quality equipment is provided to each aircrew member. As required, each unit will supplement
these guidelines to develop a viable quality control program that will assess, analyze, and
identify problem areas that may exist. Utilize this program to measure technician competence,
equipment serviceability, and overall program integrity.
   A3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Daily QCIs:
NOTE: All required QCIs should be accomplished prior to the next flight.
       A3.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Daily QCIs will be performed on 100% of all
       personnel/recovery/drogue/cargo/drag deceleration devices, torso harnesses, survival
       kits/vests, night vision devices, Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), aircrew
       Eye Respiratory Protective (AERP) mask/blower/intercom, and life preservers/rafts. In
       addition, all helmets will receive a QCI after initial build-up only.
           A3.1.1.1.1. (PACAF) At a minimum, the survival kit QCI will include the
           following: Component inspection, raft hook up and torque, and kit closure.
       A3.1.1.2. (PACAF) AFE items not listed in para. A3.1.1.1. will receive a 25% daily
       QCI.
       A3.1.1.3. (PACAF) All items received from outside support agencies will receive 100%
       QCI. These agencies include, but are not limited to: TMDE, medical supply, and
       munitions.
       A3.1.1.4. (PACAF) QCIs will be performed on 100% of all 3-skill level work until the
       individual is task certified.
   A3.1.2. (PACAF) The QCI process will also include other functions which require
   assessment on a routine basis. Section NCOICs or assistants will conduct and document
   checks on at least one of the major areas listed below on a weekly basis:
            Explosive locker/munitions program

           QA Program

           AFE Aircrew Training and Equipment

           Safety Program

  A3.1.3. (Added-PACAF) Documentation of QCI. Upon completion of the inspection, the
  inspector will document QCIs and ensure all pertinent information is gathered. The form
  will include, as a minimum, the following information.
      A3.1.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Item/equipment type, local control number, name of item
      inspector, date of QCI, discrepancy (if noted), name of QC inspector, and a suspense date
      for corrective action. Also, include areas for corrective action (EXAMPLE: page and
      paragraph from T.O.), date corrected, and initials of person correcting the discrepancy.
  A3.1.4. (Added-PACAF) Section NCOICs or assistants will conduct monthly training
  sessions on negative trends identified from the QCI process. Trend analysis will be reported
  to AFES.
  A3.1.5. (Added-PACAF) Classification/Definitions of Discrepancies.
      A3.1.5.1. (Added-PACAF) A major finding is defined as a condition that would
      endanger personnel, jeopardize equipment or system reliability, and affect safety of flight
      or warrant discontinuing the process or equipment operation.
      A3.1.5.2. (Added-PACAF) A minor finding is defined as as unsatisfactory condition
      that requires repair or correction, but does not endanger personnel, affect safety of flight,
      jeopardize equipment reliability, or warrant discontinuing a process or equipment
      operation. A minor discrepancy is one that will not affect the operation of the equipment
      but causes the equipment from being 100% compliant with current directives.
      A3.1.5.3. (Added) Units are authorized to track what is known as an administrative
      finding. An administrative finding is a documentation error that was overlooked that
      identifies critical information but has no effect on the operational process or use of the
      item.

Pararescuemen (PJ), are authorized to wear SRU-21/P survival vest, PJ Load Bearing Equipment
(LBE) or approved vest/LBE as approved by 311 HSW as required for mission execution.
Pararescuemen regularly deploy from aircraft to perform their primary mission. During routine
flights where PJ does not intend to deploy (i.e. non-alert with no Alternate Insertion/Extraction
(AIE), etc.), PJ will retain the mandatory aircrew flight equipment (AFE) items. During alert,
combat, or when required to deploy from aircraft (i.e. AIEs), PJ may modify AFE items to meet
mission requirements.

NOTES:
Aircrew flight equipment organizations will maintain the following required complement of
equipment based on number of PJs and the routine fly requirement. PJ LBE items don’t require
standardization for inspection. Components do not require securing. Pararescue personnel are not
required to wear fire-retardant/anti-exposure clothing when special purpose clothing is
considered more appropriate for mission completion.

                             GPS INSPECTION PROCEDURES

A9.1. (PACAF) Garmin GPS receivers that have acquired satellite acquisition and downloaded
almanac data must periodically reacquire satellite signals and update stored almanac data.
Receivers that have been in storage for 90 days or longer will not automatically obtain satellite
acquisition. The outdated almanac data must be cleared to force the receiver to obtain new
almanac data. Pressing and holding the ―page‖ button, then pressing the ―power‖ button, and
then releasing the ―page‖ button, can accomplish this. Using this procedure requires
approximately 10 to 15 minutes acquisition time.
A9.2. (PACAF) Approximately every 60 days obtain satellite acquisition. Allow the receiver to
track the satellites for a minimum of 15 minutes. This will update the stored almanac data.
A9.3. (PACAF) AFE Superintendent will ensure the following 60 day inspection procedures
are used for each Garmin GPS placed into service. Inspections will be IAW appropriate T.O.s,
MAJCOM, Special Instruction (SPIN) notices, and theater guidance. Inspections will be tracked
separately in unit database.
   A9.3.1. (PACAF) Power on the receiver and obtain satellite acquisition.
   A9.3.2. (PACAF) Allow receiver to track satellite for 15 minutes minimum from first
   satellite acquisition.
   A9.3.3. (PACAF) Turn receiver off.
   A9.3.4. (PACAF) Update inspection record.
A9.4. (PACAF) Units that store their Garmin GPS receivers will utilize the following
procedures prior to placing the receivers in service. These procedures should be utilized from the
area where the receiver will be operationally used.
   A9.4.1. (PACAF) Obtain satellite acquisition and new almanac data by pressing and
   holding the ―page‖ button, then pressing the ―power‖ button, and then releasing ―page‖
   button. Allow the receiver to track satellites for 15 minutes from first satellite acquisition.
   Turn receiver off. Update inspection records.
   A9.4.2. (PACAF) Inspect each receiver IAW paragraph A9.3 until the receiver is placed
   back into storage.
   A9.4.3. (PACAF) System setup will be: mode normal, hours 24, adjust contrast to best
   view, backlight 15 seconds, and sound off. Navigation setup will be: position format

   deployed during contingency operations will review Special Instructions (SPINS) at the
   deployed location to validate GPS setup.
   A9.4.4. (PACAF) Secure GPS receivers to survival vests using a 30-36 inch length of 100lb
   olive drab cord. Install an operational set and a minimum of two spare sets of batteries in the
   vest. Annotate GPS serial number on vest inspection records.
   A9.4.5. (PACAF) Establish procedures to ensure GPS assets are controlled and safeguarded
   against damage, loss, or theft.
