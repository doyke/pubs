1. General:
     1.1. For the purpose of this instruction, specific definitions are described as follows: An
     engine run is defined as anytime an aircraft engine start switch is set to the on position
     resulting in engine compressor rotation. Additionally there are two types of engine runs,
     engine idle runs and engine power runs (any engine run where the power setting is above
     idle).
     1.2. Aircraft engine runs are conducted to facilitate maintenance, diagnose discrepancies,
     and ensure system integrity.
     1.3. All aircraft parking spots are approved for engine idle runs and engine power runs in
     reverse thrust in accordance with TO 1C-17A-2-71JG-00-1 page 2-2.
     1.4. The primary location to perform engine power runs shall be on parking spots 20-26, 28
     or 30-33. The engine power run shall only be performed at these parking spots when
     Runway 03/21 is closed and when the closure is limited to 1 hour or less. If winds are out of
     limits (wind direction and velocity must be within specific tolerances as set forth in TO 1C-
     17A-2-71JG-00-1. Paragraph 1-11), if Runway 03/21 cannot be closed, or if the engine
     power run will be for a period greater than an hour, the engine power run may be performed
     at the alternate locations set forth in paragraphs 1.5 or 1.7 below.
     1.5. Parking spots 1-6 may be used as an alternate spot for engine power runs so long as the
     OG/CC approves the closure of runway 15/33.
     1.6. Certain conditions such as aircraft parking ramp at maximum capacity, wind conditions,
     and closed sections of the airfield may require aircraft to be positioned on designated engine
     run spots which are located on Taxiway Kilo and Taxiway Delta. These designated locations
     are set forth in paragraphs 1.8, 2.5.5.1, 2.5.5.2, and 2.5.5.3 (for visual aid see attachment 2).
     1.7. Prior to an aircraft being positioned on any taxiway, the Airfield Management (OSA)
     Duty Officer will be contacted for approval. The OSA Duty Officer will coordinate the
     aircraft position with the Control Tower and issue a local Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).
     1.8. If an engine power run is expected to last more than 1 hour and the run is not in reverse
     thrust, the aircraft will be towed to spot 88/89 (old blast fence area) or to the dog leg area of
     Taxiway Kilo with the nose facing towards the approach end of Runway 03, and the exhaust
     pointed toward the Hot Cargo Area.
     1.9. MXG/CC and OG/CC must approve any exceptions to the policies covered in this
     instruction.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. Operations Group Commander
        2.1.1. Coordinates with the production superintendent, Maintenance Operations Center
        (MOC), and Base Operations for active runway closures, if required.

     2.2. Flight Line Ramrod
        2.2.1. Coordinates with the Production Superintendent and MOC for active runway

     NOTAM, closing the affected section of taxiway and coordinates with Charleston Tower
     to ensure Automatic Terminal Information Service is updated to reflect the following:
        2.5.5.1. If the aircraft is on engine run spot D1 (adjacent to aircraft parking spot 5,
        aircraft positioned nose toward Taxiway Echo), close Taxiway Delta from spot 4
        through 6.

       2.7.5. When running engines above idle, the person operating the engine controls must
       ensure the aircraft has a clear path in case the aircraft should jump chocks. Additionally,
       operators must verify the engines are not hanging over the grass.
       2.7.6. When running engines above idle, especially at max thrust, ensure person standing
       as ground observer is alert in detecting any traffic approaching behind the aircraft; i.e.
       other aircraft or vehicles. Return engines to idle until traffic has cleared the area behind
       aircraft.
