This instruction implements AFPD 10-8, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) and AFI
14-104, Oversight of Intelligence Activities. This publication supersedes Commander ACC’s
(COMACC) memo, Operations Involving Domestic Imagery (DI) Support Request (ISR/RPA)
Procedures for U.S. Missions, dated 17 Oct 2012. Use of intelligence surveillance, and
reconnaissance,      operations     reconnaissance;      and     remotely       piloted      aircraft
(ISR/OPSRECCE/RPA), particularly for Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA)
mission(s) operating collection systems outside of DoD-controlled airspace within the U.S. may
require Secretary of Defense (SecDef) approval. This ACC Instruction (ACCI) applies to all Air
Combat Command active duty, Air Force Reserve (AFR), and Air National Guard (ANG) while
under Title 10 authority as well as civilian personnel, including, but not limited, to civil service
and contract employees when assigned or attached to ACC units, staffs or when training with
ACC assets. ANG units affiliated with ACC acting in Title 32 or State Active Duty (SAD) status
will coordinate with ACC using the procedures described herein. This ACCI codifies ACC’s
reporting and approval policy with respect to ISR/OPSRECCE/RPA during domestic imagery
collection missions, including training, outside of DoD-controlled airspace, or in an incident
awareness and assessment (IAA) role supporting a Combatant Command’s mission in the U.S.
Maintain official records in accordance with AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of them in accordance with the Air Force Records Information Management System
(AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Contact supporting records managers as
required for approval. Send comments and suggested improvements to this instruction on AF

Org box via NIPR or SIPR channels. This publication may be supplemented at any level, but all
direct Supplements must be routed through the OPR prior to certification and approval to ACC
Operations Center/OPSO Org Box via NIPR or SIPRnet. This publication institutes ACC’s
standardized procedures for emergent and recurring requests as it applies to ACC’s
ISR/OPSRECCE/RPA platforms in the U.S. (which includes the District of Columbia, and the
territories and possessions of the U.S., to a 12 nautical mile seaward limit of these land areas). It
clarifies the roles and responsibilities of ACC assigned and attached units with respect to state
and federal domestic imagery (DI) supports requests. It further defines DoD-controlled airspace,
operation of collection systems outside of DoD-controlled airspace and identifies ISR platforms.
The approval authority to use ISR/OPSRECCE/RPA for other missions, including, but not
limited to: DSCA, Search and Rescue, support to Law Enforcement Activities, and Civil
Disturbance Operations, in the U.S. varies depending on the mission and final destination of the
source data/imagery. Based on the situation, authority may or may not reside at the Wing level.

1. Purpose. Operations involving DI support using ISR/OPSRECCE/RPA involve a balancing
of fundamental interests: conducting aircrew training in support of national security objectives
and providing incident awareness and assessment support when requested while also protecting
individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the laws of the U.S. The primary objective
of the ACCI is to ensure that ACC units conducting DI missions within U.S. do not infringe on
or violate the Constitutional or privacy rights of U.S. persons. Commanders, inspectors general,
and judge advocates at all levels must be cognizant of DI policies. This is also consistent with
AFI 14-104, which directs intelligence oversight (IO) requirements for Air Force flying
operations.
2. Definitions.
     2.1. DI is defined here as, “any imagery collected by airborne platforms that cover the land
     areas of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Territories and possessions, to a
     12 nautical mile (NM) seaward limit of these land areas.”
     2.2. “DoD-controlled airspace” is defined as DoD-restricted or warning airspace, designated
     Military Operating Areas (MOAs) or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-designated
     low-level training routes. Imaging of surface objects located under the lateral confines of
     DoD-controlled airspace is permitted, to include, but not limited to, private property such as
     homes and vehicles and without prior consent IAW AFI 14-104, so long as there is no intent
     to target specific U.S. persons.
     2.3. “Operating collection systems outside of DoD-controlled airspace” is defined as either
     an ISR/OPSRECCE/RPA platforms physically located outside of DoD-controlled airspace
     or where sensors are pointed at and acquiring imagery on surface areas outside the lateral
     boundaries of DoD-controlled airspace.
3. Approval Authority. DI operations must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and
policies, to include, but not limited to, restrictions on collecting intelligence on U.S. persons, and
must avoid actual or perceived violations of the Posse Comitatus Act. ACC requires that all
operations involving ISR/OPSRECCE/RPA DI outside of DoD-controlled airspace be
coordinated through the ACC Operations Center. The bar for approval will be high, based on
mission requirements, and may need approval at the ACC/A3 level or ultimately the SecDef,
prior to execution. ACC Wing Commanders are therefore encouraged to work with Federal,
State and local authorities to identify non-DoD options prior to initiating an
ISR/OPSRECCE/RPA DI request.
4. Approval Process. Units will initiate a staff package, including the unit’s Proper Use
Memorandum (PUM), FAA Certificate of Authorization (CoA) (for RPAs only), unit level JA
legal review and a modified 8-line request (Attachment 2 and Table A2.1), and forward it to the
ACC Operations Center. The modified 8-line request is specifically intended to provide
sufficient detail of the mission, Combatant Commander (CCDR)/Lead Federal Agencies
supported, and type of imagery to be collected. Packages must be forwarded with sufficient time
for appropriate level of approval. Packages must be submitted no later than duty days prior to
mission execution for ACC approval only. Reference the Airborne Domestic Imagery
Authorities Matrix (Attachment 3 and Table A3.1) for event categories and approval
authorization level(s). Notification packages to ACC will include sufficient information on the
ACCI10-810 17 DECEMBER 2013                                                                    5


event to make an informed judgment on its propriety and approval level, including a statement of
detail where collection systems will be operated outside of DoD-controlled airspace. A
comprehensive notification for recurrent events will suffice, but must be submitted annually to
higher headquarters (HHQ) authorities.
   4.1. ACC will require 30 calendar days minimum when the ACC Operations Center is
   required to staff packages for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) or SecDef
   approval authority. In addition to modified 8-line package requirements, include a map of DI
   area if it must be staffed to CJCS or SecDef. Reference the Airborne Domestic Imagery
   Authorities Matrix (Attachment 3 and Table A3.1) for the event types and approval
   authorities.
       4.1.1. In the 8-line, units must identify the potential involvement of non-DoD agencies or
       groups, including media, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), Congressional
       representative/staff/delegations, state/local/trial government representatives or foreign
       military or government officials in any DI training or mission. Specifically include
       whether or not DI will be disseminated to them in some manner, as this may require
       special approval from the ACC/A2X, ACC/IA and/or ACC/PA. [Normally only real-
       time displays will be permitted in the presence of appropriate public affairs and
       operations security personnel, after proper security classification review. For foreign
       officials, dissemination will only be permitted to participating nations listed in the
       appropriate delegation of disclosure authorization letter.]
   4.2. ANG units affiliated with ACC acting in Title 32 or State Active Duty (SAD) status will
   submit a modified 8-line package to ACC for Title 10 events when it may impact other
   SecDef-ordered missions (i.e., future scheduled deployments or U.S. reach back support). If
   the doesn’t apply, then ANG units will submit a modified 8-line package to NGB if operating
   outside of DoD-controlled airspace per their own procedures and will coordinate with ACC
   for situational awareness only. AFR units will submit a modified 8-line package to AFRC if
   operating outside of DoD-controlled airspace per their own procedures and will coordinate
   with ACC for situational awareness only.
   4.3. ISR platforms identified: MC-12, U-2, MQ-1, RQ-4, E-8 and tactical unmanned aircraft
   systems (e.g., RQ-11 and RQ-20). The MQ-9 will be considered an ISR platform when
   conducting ISR or IAA missions. Approval authority for flying these ISR assets while
   operating collection systems outside of DoD-controlled airspace approval authorities mostly
   likely will be above the wing level.
   4.4. The Airborne Domestic Imagery Authorities Matrix and the modified 8-line request can
   be       found      on       the     ACC         Operations      center     website    at
   https://acc.eim.acc.af.mil/org/A3/A3O/A3O3OP/default.aspx on NIPR and on the ACC
   OC at http://intelshare.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/acccat/Director/default.aspx on SIPR.
   4.5. The unit will coordinate CoA approval with the FAA directly (if required) and submit
   CoA with the 8-Line. When sending a request, wings will use the 8-line data lines to relay
   the required information, to include data needed to complete the PUM, to HQ ACC to begin
   the review and approval process. The unit will submit the request to the ACC Operations
   Center Operations Officer (OPSO), who will staff the request for approval. ACC wings will
   submit     modified    8-line     requests   to    ACC's    Operations    Center   OPSO,
   (acc.contingencyteam.opsofficer@langley.af.mil), via the Non-classified Internet Protocol
 6                                                           ACCI10-810 17 DECEMBER 2013


     Router Network (NIPRNet) or Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) as
     appropriate.
     4.6. Civil and Search and Rescue (SAR) support – ISR unit support to SAR actions,
     typically requires ACC coordination and may require SecDef approval if utilizing an RPA
     asset. IAW DoDD 3025.18. Defense Support of Civil Authorities, the unit CC may have
     IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AUTHORITY to give direct support to civil authorities if
     judgment of immediate threat to life, limb, to save lives, prevent human suffering, or mitigate
     great property damage when local capabilities are overwhelmed and they request assistance.
     Absent HHQ direction, the local CC should re-assess his position at least every 72 hours.
     After-the-fact HHQ notification is required per AFI 10-801 Defense Support of Civilian
     Authorities (DSCA). Units must always consider that coordination with higher headquarters
     is required.
5. Roles and Responsibilities.
     5.1. ACC/A3O Operations Center. ACC/A3O coordinates all ISR/OPSRECCE/RPA DI
     approval requests in coordination with ACC/JAO, ACC/A3M, ACC/A3C, ACC/A3A and
     ACC/A2X. For 8-line requests requiring Headquarters Air Force (HAF), CJCS, or SecDef
     notification, coordination or approval, ACC/A3O will coordinate through AF/A3O.
     5.2. ACC/JAO. ACC/JAO will review all modified 8-line packages submitted by wings for
     compliance with applicable laws and policies for the mission described in the package.
     ACC/JAO will also review all ACC PUMs for legal sufficiency.
     5.3. ACC/A2X. ACC/A2X will review and approve all modified 8-line packages submitted
     by wings for compliance with IO policies. ACC/A2X POCs will review and staff all ACC
     PUMs for approval IAW AFI14-104.
     5.4. ACC/A3M and ACC/A3C.          As appropriate, ACC/A3C and A3M will review all
     modified 8-line packages from or for wings under their functional responsibility. Requests
     from A3C or A3M functional wings will be reviewed for completeness. Requests not
     originating at A3C or A3M functional wings will be evaluated for Global Force Management
     impacts.
     5.5. ACC/A3A. ACC/A3A will assist units with ACC CoA requests with the FAA as
     required.
     5.6. ACC/A3T. ACC/A3T will review and coordinate on all wing OPSRECCE packages as
     required.
ACCI10-810 17 DECEMBER 2013                                                                   7


  5.7. ACC/PA. ACC/PA will review and coordinate any subordinate units’ talking points or
  media plans associated with RPA use as required.
  5.8. ACC/IA. ACC/IA will review all 8-line requests involving foreign government
  participation to ensure compliance with Foreign Disclosure requirements and to determine
  whether the particular nation has an appropriate delegation of disclosure authorization letter
  on file as required.

   Notes For The Airborne Domestic Imagery Authorities Matrix
   i. To determine whether an asset is an “intelligence component capability,” (ICC) or
      whether a non-IC asset is being used as an ICC, intelligence law practitioners use the “5
      Ps” Test (People, Pipes, Process, Platforms, and Purpose):
    People – What is the mission of the unit -- intel, training, operational, or other? What money
is used to fund the unit?
   Pipes - Are intelligence component systems being used to disseminate the product? (e.g.,
products hung on J2/A2 portal or use of intelligence systems backbone such as the Joint
Worldwide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS) to push products to clients)? What
money is used to fund those systems?
    Process – Where is the information going? Is an intelligence component or its personnel
being used to process, analyze, or create products from the data collected (e.g., 601st Intelligence,
Surveillance and Reconnaissance Division (IRD) conduct the processing, exploitation and
dissemination (PED))?
    Platforms - Is the platform owned or operated by and intelligence unit? If not, is a non-intel
platform being used for intelligence gathering? (e.g., F-16 targeting pod used to collect ground
information for CC’s situational awareness (SA) for DSCA support)? What money is used to

                                Authority             Guidance
                                                      (see References

fund the equipment?
   Purpose – What is the purpose of the activity? Is it to gather intelligence? Is it to train? Is it
a mission in support of civil authorities?
   ii. The determination as to whether or not an activity or asset constitutes an ICC, and the
       related approval authority level, is a command decision. It is highly recommended that
       such decisions be made in full consultation with the A3, A2, and JA and documented in
       some manner. In potentially controversial cases, coordination with HAF A2, A3 and
       SAF/GC is recommended.
   iii. If CI / FI, the approval authority varies depending on special collection procedures to be
        used : Procedure 5 – Electronic Surveillance; Procedure 6 – Concealed Monitoring;
        Procedure 7 – Non-Consensual Physical Searches; Procedure 8 – Mail Searches and
        Examination; Procedure 9 – Physical Surveillance; Procedure 10 – Undisclosed
        Participation in Organizations.
   iv. DCSA consists of temporary support to U.S. civil agencies (FEMA, Department of
       Homeland Security (DHS)) for domestic emergencies.
   v. ICs/ ICCs are only specifically authorized to conduct CI/FI and all other activities or
      missions require SecDef approval –with the limited exception of training, under certain
      circumstances as well as activities approved by SecDef or the President of the U.S.
      (POTUS). The only regulation that codifies this is Joint Publication 3-28, Defense
      Support of Civil Authorities 31 July 13.
   vi. The 7 delegated authorities in the Standing DSCA EXORD are: Situational Awareness,
       Damage Assessment, Evacuation Monitoring, Search and Rescue (SAR), Chemical,
       Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Enhanced Conventional Weapons (CBRNE)
       Assessment, Hydrographic Survey, Dynamic ground coordination. The DSCA EXORD is
       currently under revision so refer to the most current version.
   vii. Normally the request for forces (RFF)/request for assistance (RFA) flows thru SecDef,
        CJCS, Joint Staff’s Joint Director of Military Support (JDOMS), USPACOM,
        USNORTHCOM, Air Forces Northern (AFNORTH) and then the major command
        (MAJCOM) / ANG sources.
   viii.        Immediate Response Authority (IRA) is triggered by a request from civil
        authorities under "imminently serious conditions" with no time to seek approval from
        higher authority. In today’s communications environment, rarely is there insufficient
        time to seek approval from HHQ. The local CC may respond to the request, but should
        submit a request for approval to HHQ while continuing to execute until such a time as
        they receive approval from HHQ or direction to cease and desist. For SAR events, when
        Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) “asks not tasks” a wing to assist with a
        mission, typically this gives rise to IRA. There is no direct guidance on using RPAs or
        ICCs for immediate response. Local CCs should seek to use other assets first and if

                                                     (see References
                                                     for cites)
      RPAs or ICCs are necessary, the local CC is responsible for the decision to use them and
      must appropriately report after –the-fact. See EN vii.
   ix. Using RPAs or ICCs without the appropriate level of approval is a serious matter and
       requires reporting to the highest levels of the U.S. government. If RPAs or ICCs are used
       for any purpose without the required level of approval (most commonly SecDef), it is
       mandatory to submit a DoD 5240.1-R Procedure 15 Questionable Intelligence Activity
       (QIA) report that: 1) explains why the commander made such a decision (immediate
       threat to life, limb, mission, government property, etc.); 2) articulates how he/she had
       determined that law enforcement/public safety/force protection elements could not meet
       the threat requirement (timeliness, capability, etc.) and that prior approval was not
       possible; and 3) describes in detail the intelligence or other data that was collected during
       the mission - particularly anything that could be considered U.S. Persons information-
       and how it was being retained and/or disseminated. Include recommendations for any
       changes to policy, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) or training that might be
       required to better deal with such a situation in the future. This should be reported
       immediately as a “'significant or highly sensitive matter'” under DTM 08-052 if any
       information about the activity is going to be disclosed outside of DoD (Congress, media,
       public, etc.) and might “'impugn the reputation'” of the Intelligence Community or
       Defense Intelligence Components.

   x. IAW AFI 14-104, paras. 10 and 12 and AFI 14-119, para. 2.7.1, ICs collect information
      about foreign or international terrorism threats and must report potential threats to life or
      property to appropriate law enforcement agencies (LEA) when “incidentally acquired.”
      10 USC 371 (implemented by DoDI 3025.21) also requires the military to take LEA
      needs into account when planning or executing military training or operations.
      Implementation of processes to do this remains pending.
   xi. Under DoDD 5200.27, para. 4.1, “Protection of DoD Functions and Property,” only
       collect DI on these threatening activities: subversion of loyalty, discipline, or morale of
       DoD military / civilian personnel by encouraging violation of law, disobedience of
       orders, or disruption of mil activities; theft of arms, ammunition, or equipment or
       destruction or sabotage of DoD facilities, equipment, or records; acts jeopardizing
       security of DoD elements or operations or compromising classified info by disclosure or
       espionage; unauthorized demonstrations on DoD installations; direct threats to DoD
       military or civilian personnel in connection with their official duties or to other persons
       who have been authorized protection by DoD resources; activities endangering facilities
       that have classified defense contracts or officially designated as “key defense facilities;”
       and crimes for which DoD has responsibility for investigating/ prosecuting.
   xii. Civil Disturbance Operations (CDO) involve sudden and unexpected civil disturbances
        where local authorities are unable to control the situation. The significant policy concern
        is the primacy of civilian authorities.

   i. Under ERA, local CCs can engage temporarily in activities that are necessary to quell
      large-scale, unexpected civil disturbances when necessary to prevent significant loss of
      life or wanton destruction of property, to restore governmental function and public order,
      or when duly constituted Federal, State, or local authorities are unable or decline to
      provide adequate protection for Federal property or Federal Governmental functions.
      ERA only applies in extraordinary emergency circumstances where prior authorization by
      the POTUS is impossible and duly constituted local authorities are unable to control the
      situation.
   xiii.       The 7 delegated authorities in DSCA EXORD are: Situational Awareness,
        Damage Assessment, Evacuation Monitoring, SAR, CBRN Assessment, Hydrographic
        Survey, Dynamic Ground Coordination.
   xiv.       Normally the RFF/RFA flows thru SecDef, CJCS, Joint Staff’s Joint Director of
       Military Support (JDOMS), USPACOM, USNORTHCOM, AFNORTH and then the
       MAJCOM / ANG sources.
   xv. For ACC assets, use the 8 line ISR Support Request through the ACC Ops Center for
       processing. 8 line requests should include a legal review from the local JA.
   xvi.        10 U.S.C. 371, Use of information collected during military operations requires
       that the needs of civilian LEA be taken into account in the planning and execution of
       military training or operations. See also DoDI 1322.28, Realistic Military Training
       (RMT) Off Federal Real Property, 18 March 2013, which incorporates 10 USC 371
       requirements, http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/132228p.pdf; Secretary of
       Defense Memorandum, Leveraging Military Training for Incidental Support of Civil
       Authorities, 11 December 2012, which directs future policy changes to widely implement
       10 USC 371. USD(P) is drafting new policy implementation.
   xvii.      CD operations consist of either Detection and Monitoring (D&M, 10 USC 124) or
       Aerial Reconnaissance missions (AR, 10 USC 1004(b)(6) and 1004(b)(10)).
   xviii.      10 U.S.C. 371 requires that the needs of civilian LEA be taken into account in the
       planning and execution of military training or operations. USD(P) is drafting new policy
       implementation. Additionally, airborne assets used for training in conjunction with
       ground forces “off federal real property” also have unique approval authorities and
       notification procedures based on the risk associated with the event. DoDI 1322.28,
       Realistic Military Training (RMT) Off Federal Real Property, requires commanders to
       work closely with their civilian community partners, the media, and keep HHQ closely
       apprised of RMT events. Consult the DoDI for details.
 should include sufficient information on the activity or event to make an informed judgment on
its propriety (e.g., Concept of Operations (CONOPS) or 8-line equivalent, PUM, legal review
and FAA CoA, if applicable). A comprehensive notification for recurrent events would suffice,
but should be re-submitted annually and also when required.
