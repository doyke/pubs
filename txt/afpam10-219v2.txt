This volume provides information to help Air Force civil engineers prepare their installations and units
for disasters and attacks. It outlines standard civil engineer preparations and focuses on methods to protect
life and support and sustain installation and unit operations. This volume is not intended to provide
detailed construction or other “how to” procedures, rather its purpose is to provide civil engineers with the
background and actions necessary to save lives and reduce facility damage resulting from accidents,
disasters, terrorism, and war. This publication applies to all Air Force active, Air National Guard (ANG),
and Air Force Reserve Command Civil Engineer units. The pamphlet supports Air Force Instruction
(AFI) 10-210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) Program, AFI 10-211, Civil Engineer
Contingency Response Planning, and AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program

                                             INTRODUCTION

1.1. General Information. Air Force civil engineers are often tasked to respond to crises around the
globe, and the capabilities they bring to the table are crucial to mitigating the effects of an attack or disas-
ter. Yet their duties to prepare their installation and local units before a crisis occurs are equally important.
Sound preparations before a disaster or attack improve mission performance and survivability, are
cost-effective, and involve installation-wide unit participation (Figure 1.1.). To prepare for an emergency,
civil engineers focus on protecting personnel, equipment, and facilities and on posturing emergency
response and base recovery capabilities. These duties are significant and although no book covers every-
thing that must be done, this volume offers some specific preparation ideas.

Figure 1.1. Installation Agencies Train Together on Emergency Preparations.




1.2. Overview. This pamphlet introduces common civil engineer (CE) preparations for war and disaster,
including preparations for CE units and those preparations in support of other installation agencies and
units. It outlines both standard preparations and specific preparation activities that should be accom-
plished prior to an attack or natural disaster. Further, it provides a clear perspective how base and unit
preparations protect personnel and property and preserve mission-critical functions. Although not all
inclusive, specific disaster and attack preparations addressed here include: (1) vulnerability reduction, (2)
communications systems, (3) utility system isolation, (4) emergency and backup utilities, (5) beddown
operations, (6) environmental hazards, (7) CE support to and from others, and (8) base denial prepara-
tions. CE roles discussed for these areas consist of the following:
    1.2.1. Vulnerability Reduction. Assist base organizations in identifying and programming require-
    ments to reduce vulnerability of critical base facilities, equipment, and personnel. Perform site-spe-
    cific risk assessments and identify resources to provide the level of protection needed.
    1.2.2. Communications Systems. Work with the Communications Squadron to design and install
    installation notification and warning systems (INWS) and individual building mass notification sys-
    tems (MNS) for operation throughout disaster conditions. The system must be redundant, hardened, or
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                9


  splinter-protected and operate using both commercial and emergency power. Ensure the CE Damage
  Control Center (DCC), Fire Alarm Communications Center (FACC), and Mobile Emergency Opera-
  tions Center (MEOC) have survivable and interoperable communications among the primary and
  alternate Emergency Communications Center (ECC), Installation Control Center (ICC), Emergency
  Operations Center (EOC), Security Forces (SF) desk, and Medical dispatch (if applicable). Also,
  establish manual communication procedures to collect damage assessment information during disrup-
  tions to installation communication and computer systems.
  1.2.3. Utility System Isolation. Maintain accurate utility distribution system drawings within the CE
  DCC and FACC, showing the locations of all cutoff valves and switches. Periodically have the appro-
  priate personnel locate and operate these valves and switches to ensure they are operational and con-
  trol the desired systems. When possible, implement the GeoBase Mapping System to aid in
  identifying and locating critical equipment or resources.
  1.2.4. Emergency and Backup Utilities. Develop plans and identify resources required to promptly
  reestablish utilities or provide backup systems for critical facilities before or immediately after an
  attack or disaster.
  1.2.5. Beddown Operations. Provide expedient beddown support for incoming forces or disaster
  victims. Civil engineers erect, modify, or construct many of the facilities, including utilities that Air
  Force units need for military deployment and disaster relief. CE also provides on-site guidance and
  expertise to other units to erect their own portable shelters and defensive measures.
  1.2.6. Environmental Hazard Reduction. Provide trained personnel and available equipment and
  materials to help the Base Spill Response Team with containment, cleanup, and site restoration for
  hazardous substance spills.
  1.2.7. CE Support To and From Others. Provide training, guidance, labor, equipment, maps, and
  expertise as necessary. CE receives assistance with vehicles, fuels, and other logistics from support
  agencies and units.
  1.2.8. Base Denial. Plan appropriate denial methods, including item evacuation, selective component
  removal, destruction, and use of obstacles. Also prepare in advance a candidate list of select base sys-
  tems, equipment, and supplies for potential destruction should the commander direct base evacuation
  and denial action.

                            STANDARD INSTALLATION PREPARATIONS

2.1. Introduction. Smart disaster or attack preparations can be made at every installation—whether main
bases, collocated operating bases, bare bases, or remote sites. Many preparations can be completed in the
luxury of peacetime, but some can only be done at the last minute when a disaster or war threatens. There
is no “one correct way” to prepare all installations, because the threat, mission, and location of each instal-
lation differs; however, each installation, following MAJCOM guidance, takes appropriate action to pre-
pare for contingencies. CE planners must understand their installation’s mission and threats to effectively
plan for contingencies, and they should continually seek answers to specific questions that impact their
emergency planning.

2.2. Preparation Considerations.
     2.2.1. Protect functions versus individual resources. Certainly this translates into protecting person-
     nel, equipment, facilities, and utility service, but always find out specifically what must be protected
     to preserve a mission-critical function. For some key units, all assets must be protected. For others,
     only personnel and their tools must be preserved—not facilities. If you lose sight of this, you can
     expend effort and resources protecting assets which are not critical to the protected function. Con-
     versely, you can fail to protect assets in “low priority” units which provide key support to critical func-
     tions.
     2.2.2. Focus on both cost and effectiveness when deciding what to do. Cheap solutions are quickly
     embraced, but make sure the cheap fixes really work. Even valid preparations can be ineffective when
     done poorly. Ineffective efforts waste time and resources and may draw an enemy's unwanted atten-
     tion. In that case, doing nothing may be preferable to doing something poorly. Preparations can be
     expensive and elaborate, but not all have to be. Less effective, lower cost options may be “good
     enough.” Maintaining this focus usually minimizes the total time and resources spent on preparations.
     2.2.3. To avoid making insufficient preparations, units need to be part of the installation-wide plan-
     ning effort, to determine what must be done, to what quality, and why. Many preparations can be
     mutually supportive. Look for opportunities to integrate efforts.
     2.2.4. Keep a long-range perspective at permanent installations. Develop protective measures over
     time— a little each year pays off. When possible, choose actions which have multiple benefits.
     Improving installation appearance is always a winning “secondary” benefit. Multiple benefits
     improve the likelihood that permanent preparations will be approved.
     2.2.5. Every unit needs to prepare its personnel, equipment, and facilities, but not all facility prepara-
     tions must be done by civil engineers. With prior instruction or on-the-spot CE guidance, units can do
     many non-technical tasks such as sandbagging and erecting tents (Figure 2.1.). If an installation relies
     entirely on its civil engineers for preparations, especially the last minute ones, the entire effort is
     slowed.
     2.2.6. Have an occasional reality check. Make sure efforts don't conflict with those of other units.
     This requires more than a review of plans. It also means looking at what is being done in the field.

2.3. Choosing Solutions and Determining Priorities. With much to do and limited time or resources to
do it, an installation and its units must set priorities. Table 2.1. lists a number of factors to consider when
deciding what should be done, determining the extent of preparations, selecting methods, and establishing
task priorities and phases.

Table 2.1. Factors to Consider When Choosing Solutions and Determining Priorities.
           Threat:
               What are the potential enemies, likely disasters, and accidents to consider?
               What is the intensity and areas affected by each threat?
               How much advance warning time is likely?
           Base Missions:
             How important is the contribution of the host wing’s mission to the overall theater
             warfighting capability or to MAJCOM peacetime activities?
             Which tenant unit missions are also critical base missions? How do they rank with
             the host wing's mission with respect to overall theater warfighting capability and/or
             MAJCOM, AF, or DOD peacetime activities? What functions of theirs must be
             protected?
           Unit/Facility Function:
               How important is the function to base mission?
12                                                                          AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


           Vulnerability of the Function:
                How vulnerable are the assets of the critical functions?
                What is the location of assets for key functions versus other high-priority targets?
                Are those assets concentrated or dispersed? Do they need to be located in the
               threat zone or likely target areas? (Because they must be close to critical activities
               which cannot be relocated, or the function is tied to a facility or equipment in that
               facility.)
                Can the function be quickly and easily relocated on or off base? How long would
                it take to get a function partially and fully operational following relocation?
           Alternatives:
                What options are available for protecting assets?
                Are the resources available for employing those options?
           Effectiveness of a Preparation:
                How effective is an option?
                Can it be combined with one or more other options to further improve the
                effectiveness of the preparations?
           Cost:
                What can the base afford?

2.4. An Approach to Preparing Your Installation. Preparations usually focus on protecting the most
important base functions, protecting personnel and key assets, and getting units ready to quickly respond.
Timely preparations should include a “whole base” look at the base's important functions. Integrate all
host and tenant unit functions into a prioritized list for further planning actions. One method of prioritiz-
ing is to look at the function's level (national level strategic, theater level strategic, theater level tactical,
or strictly tactical) when considering it's importance. An installation and its units should have game plans
for accomplishing short-notice and long-term preparations. Both are important and can be developed con-
currently. Short-notice preparations focus on expedient measures and response team preparations.
     2.4.1. Short-Notice Preparations. For each likely threat, decide what last-minute preparations are
     most important to make when given little advance warning. Consider dividing short-notice actions
     into phases, and include the most important tasks and the long-lead-time tasks in the early phases.
     When logical, tie each phase to a specific threat or defense condition. Then, in theory, the tasks in a
     phase are started when the corresponding threat/defense condition is declared. Plans for short-notice
     preparations should specify what is to be done, by whom, with what resources, and when.
        2.4.1.1. First-phase efforts often involve rounding up resources (personnel, equipment, vehicles,
        and supplies) to be used in subsequent phases if an increase in the threat/defense condition is
        declared.
        2.4.1.2. Early preparations need not provide the final solution. They can be added to or modified
        in later phases. For example, to protect an unhardened installation command and control node,
        civil engineers push up a 6-foot high earth berm around it in phase one. In phase two, with one CE
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                13


      person to train them, operational support squadron personnel place sandbags on the berm and
      extend its height to 8 feet. This phased approach may be necessary to ensure the work which is
      most important to the installation gets done first. However, phasing work can be inefficient
      because of the time required to relocate CE personnel, equipment, and materials to a previous
      work site. This inefficiency is reduced when other units do some or most of their own prepara-
      tions.
      2.4.1.3. When executing short-notice preparations, set up a work control function in the CE con-
      trol center (or Damage Control Center) to keep track of what CE is supposed to do and what it is
      actually doing. Follow the plan unless you get modifying guidance from the commander. In your
      short-notice preparation checklists, be sure to include actions targeted just for your unit as well as
      those which support other installation units.
      2.4.1.4. Keep short-notice preparation plans and checklists current. Add and delete actions as
      events trigger the need for changes. Such events include threat changes, mission changes, and unit
      moves to different or new facilities. Threats can change quickly; e.g., when a nation chooses to
      become antagonistic or an adversary chooses peace. More often threats change slowly, such as
      when a threatening nation gradually improves the number and quality of its weapons.
      2.4.1.5. Keep emergency response and base recovery skills sharp. Preparations can mitigate the
      effects of an enemy attack or of a natural disaster or peacetime accident, but no amount of prepa-
      ration can eliminate the need to respond to those crises. Preparations should enable teams to
      respond well and quickly. Unlike many preparations which can be done once, practicing emer-
      gency response and base recovery procedures must be an ongoing effort. Response teams should
      practice often and realistically with the vehicles, equipment, tools, and materials they are expected
      to use (Figure 2.2.).

Figure 2.2. Keep Response Teams’ Skills Sharp Through Realistic Practice.




      2.4.1.6. Teach a core of personnel in other units how to prepare their facilities and protect their
      personnel and key resources. Examples include laying sandbags and erecting tents. This makes
      those units more self-reliant and less dependent on limited CE resources. This also makes your
      personnel better, because they have to learn the tasks well enough to teach others. You may have
      to advertise and push this service, because other units are not likely to call you. They tend to think
      many preparations are your job. The lessons give you a chance to educate them.

      2.4.2. Long-Term Preparations. Make long-term preparations for each likely threat—decide what
      permanent preparations make sense. An installation needs a multi-year improvement plan for prepara-
      tions that are extensive, expensive, or require major construction. A plan provides focus and continu-
      ity since base personnel will likely change many times during the life of the plan. It should be
      self-explanatory, because new personnel must understand what was intended and what they must do.

2.5. Standard Preparation Actions. Table 2.2. through Table 2.7. are common disaster and attack prep-
aration actions that civil engineers might make on their installation, and each will be discussed in depth in
subsequent chapters. In many cases, these preparations apply to both disaster and attack activities; how-
ever, some preparations may be unnecessary or impractical to do at every installation. In other cases, the
preparations may only apply to overseas installations and then only when there is a credible enemy threat.
The lists are offered to stimulate ideas when developing unit plans; they are not comprehensive. Look at
the wing's Emergency Action Procedures and support plans for specific tasks. Understand that prepara-
tions will never be complete. There is always something more which can be done. To keep preparations in
perspective, bases and units need to have preparation plans and continue to build on those plans as cir-
cumstances change.

               VULNERABILITY REDUCTION AND RESOURCE PROTECTION

3.1. Introduction. Reducing the vulnerability of personnel and key resources to attacks and natural
disasters is an important installation preparation action. Civil engineers assist in this endeavor by helping
installation organizations identify and program requirements to reduce the vulnerability of critical facili-
ties, equipment, and personnel. Specific actions include identifying and determining the capacity of all
facilities that could be used as shelters; identifying facilities, utilities, and waste collection and disposal
points for expedient beddown operations; identifying facilities that can be reconfigured or substituted for
destroyed facilities; considering hardening command and control facilities, access and perimeter gates,
utility generating plants, and mission-essential shelters; and determining other facility hardening require-
ments; surveying and identifying dispersal and evacuation sites; assisting organizations with the construc-
tion and repair of bunkers and revetments; and implementing actions to increase a facility’s physical and
passive protection against terrorist activities.

3.2. Shelters. Identifying and determining the capacity of existing and potential shelters on an installa-
tion can be a daunting task. It can certainly be overwhelming during the midst of a crisis. Knowing the
type and duration (long or short term) of protection needed is critical when identifying prospective shel-
ters. Keep in mind that shelters used to protect personnel, equipment, aircraft, and armament from the
effects of CBRNE may vary greatly from shelters used to protect personnel from accidents involving
HAZMAT or the consequences of natural disasters. If protection against CBRNE is a primary criterion for
shelter selection, review AFH 10-222 Volume 3, Guide to Civil Engineer Force Protection, and UFC
3-340-01, Design and Analysis of Hardened Structures to Conventional Weapons Effects, for detailed
information on blast effects, blast standoff distances, and other planning factors. The following para-
graphs offer some factors to consider when identifying potential shelters.
   3.2.1. Personnel Shelters. Depending on construction, these shelters can provide personnel protec-
   tion for short or long periods. Shelters intended for short-term use are generally employed for imme-
   diate disaster protection or to shelter personnel from the effects of weapon attacks. Short-term shelters
   generally offer expedient protection and are normally occupied just before and during a disaster or
   attack and may not provide protection and utilities for extended living. In contrast, long-term shelters
   (often used for disaster relief and incoming personnel) may be occupied for extended periods, offer
   protection from the elements, and when appropriately hardened, may provide limited protection from
   small arms weapons fire, shell fragments, and the effects of chemical, biological, radiological, and
   nuclear (CBRN) weapons.
       3.2.1.1. Short-Term Shelters. Such shelters may be existing permanent facilities (Shelter in
       Place) or temporary structures constructed from locally available materials. They may also be con-
       structed using prefabricated concrete modular forms, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) items, or
       built by local contractors. These shelters may be the only alternative when there are not enough
       permanently hardened facilities in the right locations. This is especially true in bare base or dis-
       persed operations. The best short-term shelter is usually one that provides the most protection but
       requires the least amount of effort to construct. Shelters should have as much overhead cover as
       possible. They should be limited to about 25 personnel and dispersed. When possible, shelters
       should be hidden next to buildings, on the back sides of hills, in woods, or in natural depressions
       in the terrain; but out of drainage paths. Below-ground shelters require the most construction
20                                                                    AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


      effort but generally provide the highest level of protection from conventional and chemical weap-
      ons. Aboveground shelters provide the best observation and are easier to enter and exit than
      below-ground shelters. They provide the least amount of protection from conventional weapons;
      however, they do provide protection against liquid droplets of chemical agents. Aboveground
      shelters are used when water levels are close to the ground surface or when the ground is so hard
      that digging a below-ground shelter is impractical. Defensive bunkers and fighting positions for
      base defense and antiterrorism measures are also short-term shelters and are addressed in AFH
      10-222, Volume 14, Guide to Fighting Positions, Obstacles, and Revetments.
      3.2.1.2. Long-Term Shelters. Air bases often identify and use existing permanent facilities for
      shelters that will be occupied for periods longer than a few hours. However, temporary shelters
      (Figure 3.1.) such as TEMPER tents, Alaska Small Shelter Systems, COTS products, and others
      may be used when permanent facilities are not available. In some cases, temporary facilities are
      modified to support extended living and may even be hardened to protect against attack. Specific
      factors to consider for extended shelter occupation include space, structure, ventilation, water sup-
      ply, health and sanitation, electrical power, and food. Each factor is discussed below. These factors
      are also vital to long-term shelters and facilities used during expedient beddown operations
      addressed in Chapter 6.

Figure 3.1. Temporary Shelters May Be Used for Extended Periods When Necessary.




         3.2.1.2.1. Space. Physical space for human occupancy is the first shelter requirement. The
         approximate volume required for an adult is 2.3 cubic feet. While history has recorded cases of
         crowding for extended periods to this level, personnel will not voluntarily stay in these condi-
         tions. Many studies have been conducted to determine the minimum shelter space allocation
         standard. The US uses an area of 10 square feet (about the space an adult occupies when lying
         down) and 65 cubic feet of volume per person. Table 3.1. shows how this standard relates to
         other situations where personnel are or were confined. The US standard is spacious compared
         to other experiences; particularly wartime. Some experienced European nations recommend
         one-half meter (about 5.4 square feet) as a minimum. The recommended 10 square feet of

          usable area is a desirable goal but not always practical. Allotments reduced down to 5 square
          feet can be tolerated when there are no better alternatives.

          3.2.1.2.2. Structure. Most long-term occupancy shelters are located in permanently con-
          structed facilities. The building structure, or at least the shelter portion, must be able to with-
          stand the physical effects of the disaster or threat weapons. Existing structures can be
          upgraded using expedient hardening techniques discussed later in paragraph 3.4.
          3.2.1.2.3. Ventilation. Longer term shelters require ventilation to maintain a minimum oxy-
          gen level, prevent an excessive buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2), and control shelter tempera-
          ture. Air quality and temperature control must be provided by ventilation with outside air.
          Normal building ventilation systems cannot be counted on because commercial electric power
          may not be available. Natural ventilation may be adequate in aboveground shelters if enough
          windows are opened. In basements, ventilation is improved if cooler air can be allowed to flow
          in through doorways or windows at one end while warm shelter air escapes up an elevator
          shaft or stairwell or to higher windows at the other end. Unfortunately, natural ventilation may
          often be insufficient to maintain a habitable environment in larger shelters during warm
          weather. The best solution is to provide an emergency generator (with fuel supply) sufficient
          to operate all or a portion of the building's ventilation system—or at least provide a number of
22                                                               AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


     pedestal fans for this purpose. Other options include using aerospace ground equipment
     (AGE) ground air conditioning units from the flightline or spare environmental control units
     (ECU). Both types of units can be ducted directly into the shelter or tied into the shelter's air
     distribution ducts. If entry of CBRN contamination is an issue, CBRN filters must be installed
     in the ventilation system.
        3.2.1.2.3.1. Fresh air contains about 21 percent oxygen; when the oxygen content drops
        between 19.5 and 17.5 percent, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
        (OSHA) considers a confined space to be oxygen depleted. Below 17.5 percent, workers
        are required to be on supplied air. Studies have shown that healthy young adults can sur-
        vive without long-term effects at an oxygen level as low as 14 percent, but they cannot per-
        form sustained vigorous activities. Fortunately, it takes only 0.4 cubic feet of fresh air per
        minute per person to maintain the oxygen level at 17.5 percent.
        3.2.1.2.3.2. CO2 concentration is a bigger problem. The results of prolonged exposure to
        higher levels of CO2 have shown the desirability of keeping the level below 1 percent. The
        Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established a goal of not more than
        0.5 percent. This limit requires 3 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per person, which more
        than satisfies the oxygen requirement as well.
        3.2.1.2.3.3. In addition to consuming oxygen and generating CO2, shelter occupants pro-
        duce an average of 500 British Thermal Units (BTU) per hour. Part of that heat is given off
        as “sensible” heat that can be measured by a thermometer. The other part is given off in
        water vapor as “latent” heat. During winter months, this may be very welcome heat. How-
        ever, during summertime, proper ventilation is needed to rid a shelter of excess heat and
        moisture to prevent body temperatures from rising to dangerous levels. As long as the air
        temperature is well below skin temperature, the body can radiate heat to maintain normal
        temperature. At higher temperatures, the body must rely on evaporative cooling by perspi-
        ration. If the air is humid and air movement low, evaporative cooling loses its effective-
        ness, and body temperature will rise.
        3.2.1.2.3.4. The most widely used measure of heat and moisture effects on the human
        body is “effective temperature” (ET). It combines the effects of air temperature, air mois-
        ture, and air movement to yield equal sensations of warmth or cold and approximately
        equal amounts of heat strain. The numerical value of ET is the reading on an ordinary ther-
        mometer when the air is completely saturated (100 percent relative humidity). At less than
        100 percent, the thermometer reading would be higher than the equivalent effective tem-
        perature. For a relative humidity of more than 50 percent, a common summertime level, an
        effective temperature of 82 degrees would correspond to air temperatures in the mid-90s.
        3.2.1.2.3.5. Using 82 degrees as the minimum effective temperature, the map in Figure
        3.2. defines the required ventilation (in cubic feet per minute per person) in the different
        zones in the US. The ventilation provides 90 percent reliability of maintaining the effective
        temperature in the shelter at 82 degrees or less. As you can see, the required ventilation
        rates are all greater than the 3 cubic feet per minute per person needed to control the CO2
        buildup. Therefore, adequate ventilation to maintain effective temperature also provides
        sufficient oxygen and control of CO2 buildup.

          3.2.1.2.4. Water Supply. An assured water supply is important if the shelter is to be occupied
          for an extended period. During wintertime, or in an uncrowded shelter, 3.5 gallons per person
          will last for approximately 2 weeks; this may last only 3 days in hot weather. Figure 3.3. illus-
          trates the relationship of required water versus shelter air temperature. Given an abundance of
          water, people can drink extra water to help compensate for deficiencies in temperature control,
          but do not count on normal water sources. Having sufficient quantities of water often creates a
          storage problem (as does disposal of liquid wastes). Plastic and metal trash cans, with plastic
          bags as liners, are suitable and readily available as are 1-gallon plastic jugs and 5-gallon plas-
          tic cans.

Figure 3.3. Minimum Water Required.
24                                                                AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


        3.2.1.2.4.1. When water intake is restricted or negligible, the bodies of healthy people
        compensate by reducing the amount of urine excretion by about half, from about 3 pounds
        (pints) in adults to about 1-1/2 pounds. Unless people are required to perspire to lose body
        heat, about 1 quart of water suffices to maintain the water balance. If the shelter tempera-
        ture is warm, however, the amount of water needed to avoid dehydration increases rapidly.
        This is another reason to be concerned about temperature control in shelters.
        3.2.1.2.4.2. The consequences of dehydration vary widely among individuals, with the
        very young, very old, and ill being especially vulnerable. Pregnant women require more
        water than usual and must avoid dehydration to prevent injury to the unborn child. Gener-
        ally there is nothing to be gained by stretching out inadequate water supplies to cover a
        presumed shelter stay. Health is best maintained by delaying any dehydration as long as
        possible. Water management should be aimed at ensuring adequate intake and preventing
        waste rather than at rationing the available supply, particularly since there is no way to
        determine a “fair share” for each person except by satisfying thirst.
        3.2.1.2.4.3. Water for washing is an amenity and not a necessity for an extended shelter
        stay.
     3.2.1.2.5. Health and Sanitation. Minimizing the spread of disease or infection requires con-
     stant attention to sanitation measures, cleanliness of toilet areas, careful handling of water and
     food, and establishment of an isolation area for personnel who are ill. The disposal of human
     waste is the highest priority sanitation need. The emergency standard is one commode per 50
     people. Shelter areas will have few conventional commodes, if any, and flushing water must
     be limited. Toilet facilities can still be used, however. The contents of chemical toilets can be
     disposed of by dumping into the conventional toilets. If water is available, those toilets can be
     flushed occasionally. Otherwise, emptied water containers, plastic bags, or other containers
     must be used to store wastes. As a rough rule of thumb, waste storage capacity must be able to
     handle about 1/2 gallon of sewage per person per day.
        3.2.1.2.5.1. Portable chemical toilets are the best substitute for the lack of conventional
        toilets. Makeshift commodes can be made by lining large cans with heavy-duty plastic
        bags and improvising a seat with a pair of boards or cutting a hole in plywood. Disinfectant
        (chlorine, bleach, etc.) should be poured in periodically to fight germs and odors. If human
        waste must be stored, plastic bags from chemical commodes can be tied off when nearly
        full and placed in large covered garbage cans. Double bag the waste to prevent spills if a
        bag tears.
        3.2.1.2.5.2. Keeping toilet areas and toilets clean is a big part of preventive medicine.
        Unless the shelter space is part of a facility occupied in peacetime, janitorial and cleaning
        supplies, such as trash cans, brooms, and mops, are not usually available. Additional sup-
        plies of heavy-duty plastic bags are invaluable.
        3.2.1.2.5.3. Bathing is not a necessity, but some water is needed to allow food handlers to
        wash their hands; this reduces the transmission of disease.
        3.2.1.2.5.4. Perform good housekeeping practices as much as possible. Substantial
        amounts of litter and trash accumulate in a crowded shelter. This ranks high on a shelter
        “discomfort index.”
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                25


        3.2.1.2.6. Electrical Power. As eluded to earlier, emergency power is important for ventila-
        tion, but it is also needed to provide limited lighting in the shelter. Lighting levels need only be
        sufficient for personnel to navigate within the shelter and find exits, although sufficient light-
        ing for reading helps morale. Excess lighting adds to the heat load, which is unwelcome in hot
        conditions.
        3.2.1.2.7. Food. Providing food is not a CE responsibility, but the packaging and types of
        food consumed can affect water consumption, shelter heat load, and waste generation. CE
        planners should coordinate with shelter planners to address requirements affected by shelter
        food stocks. Food is near the end of the list of essential shelter needs. Healthy adults can sur-
        vive without food for several weeks given adequate water and temperature conditions. This
        does not consider the emotional impact. People consider food a basic and will likely leave the
        shelter if it is not available. If shelter occupants are expected to participate in base recovery
        operations, they must eat. Foods high in protein or fat greatly increase the amount of drinking
        water required to eliminate wastes. A diet composed entirely of carbohydrates is also undesir-
        able. Heating or cooking foods adversely affects temperature control, requires an assured heat
        source, and can constitute a hazard in a crowded shelter. Foods that require cooking or eating
        utensils or that produce garbage or trash offer sanitation problems. Perishable foods are not
        recommended and, if brought in, should be consumed first. The “best” foods are crackers and
        canned goods which are easy to transport, store, and prepare, as are whole-grain cereal prod-
        ucts and dried fruits. Augmentation with food products that are mostly liquid is desirable.
        Glass containers present a problem and should be handled with care if they cannot be avoided.
        Shelter occupants should bring ready-to-eat food to supplement any shelter stocks.
     3.2.1.3. Collective Protection. Collective protection is an important factor when determining
     personnel shelter requirements. Ideally, it provides a temperature-controlled, contamination-free
     environment to allow personnel relief from continuous wear of individual protective equipment
     (IPE). The basic concept for most facility collective protection solutions is to provide overpres-
     sure, filtration, and controlled entry and exit. Maintaining a higher internal air pressure than exter-
     nal pressure and filtering incoming air prevent contaminated external air from infiltrating the
     shelter. Other types of collective protection rely on the facility structure to provide short-term pro-
     tection. They are not equipped with positive pressure air filtration systems or airlocks and use
     shelter-in-place techniques to limit or delay the entry of contamination. Collective protection sup-
     ports two mission sustainment areas that quickly erode in a CBRN environment: personnel rest
     and relief (breaks and sleeping) and work relief (command and control, medical treatment, mis-
     sion-oriented protective posture (MOPP) recovery time after maximum work effort). Each instal-
     lation must assess collective protection requirements based upon the likely threats and mission
     requirements. Specific collective protection solutions may include a mixture of permanent, mobile
     or transportable, or expedient or temporary collective protection systems. Refer to AFMAN
     10-2602 (until rescinded by AFMAN 10-2502, Series publication) for more detailed information
     on shelters with collective protection systems.
     3.2.1.4. Nuclear Protection. The design and construction of shelters to resist the direct effects
     (versus a direct hit) of nuclear weapons are complex, costly, and beyond the scope of this publica-
     tion. Considerable information is available on the construction, preparation, and operation of shel-
     ters to protect personnel from the direct effects of a nuclear blast and from radioactive fallout.

     3.2.2. Equipment Shelters. Similar to personnel shelters, equipment shelters used to protect vehicles
     and equipment vary in design and function—from temporary to permanent structures. Figure 3.4.
     shows equipment containers and vehicles inside a Rapid Deployment Bare Base Shelter System
     (Dome Shelter) at a forward deployed location. The covered design helps to protect equipment and
     vehicles from chemical and biological contamination in the event of an attack. Expedient equipment
     shelters can be erected using modular concrete panels, revetments, and other materials and designs.
     Although these designs typically do not offer overhead protection, they will provide some degree of
     blast, small arms, and indirect fire protection. There are many types of equipment shelters used during
     contingencies—some are manufactured and others are expediently constructed. See AFH 10-222,
     Volumes 2, 6, and 14, for more information concerning equipment shelters.

Figure 3.4. Sheltered Vehicles and Equipment.




     3.2.3. Aircraft Shelters. Shelters used to protect helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and unmanned
     aerial vehicle (UAV) aircraft vary greatly and are based as much on when and where the shelters were
     built as on the type of protection provided (Figure 3.5. through Figure 3.9.). Some permanent aircraft
     shelters provide only minimal protection from the elements while others are hardened facilities that
     provide near total protection from enemy attack, including protection from the effects of CBRN weap-
     ons. Other aircraft shelters may provide limited ballistic protection or shield from small arms weapons
     fire and blast fragments. Although aircraft shelters built from steel revetment kits are still in wide-
     spread use, the amount of time and equipment required to airlift and erect these kits is considerable. In
     time, more advanced, resource-friendly barriers may replace the older steel revetment kits in many
     expeditionary environments.

     3.2.4. Summary. Personnel shelters protect people from the effects of weapons and disasters. Having
     “a place to jump when the bombs start falling” or when disaster strikes provides people with a sense
     of security. Expedient shelters are relatively easy and quick to construct and may be the only option at
     many installations. Aircraft and equipment shelters minimize damage to critical assets and help to pre-
     serve the mission. Whatever the reason for the shelter, good disaster and attack preparations help to
     ensure shelters are available if the need arises.

3.3. Redundancy. Like an attack, a disaster could easily knock out critical utility systems or facilities.
Planning and preparations should include procedures to establish redundant or backup sources in case
utilities are destroyed or rendered unusable. Installations should also consider redundancy when design-
ing or redesigning utility systems. Redundant utility systems are addressed in Chapter 5, Isolation, Emer-
gency Backup, and Protection of Utilities.

3.4. Hardening. Another key factor of CE preparations for disaster and attack is facility hardening. From
a civil engineer perspective, hardening is the process of strengthening buildings and utility systems to
resist destructive effects of weapons or natural forces. Hardening is used to prevent loss of critical
resources and functions inside those facilities and to protect the utility systems supporting the critical
assets and functions. Hardening may be permanently constructed into facilities either during initial con-
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                29


struction or added later as supplemental hardening. Permanent hardening is accomplished during peace-
time, because there is not enough time for detailed engineering designs or elaborate construction when an
enemy or disaster threatens. More often, engineers are called on in an expeditionary environment to pro-
vide expedient hardening, such as rapidly erecting a sandbag wall or building protective barriers and soil
berms. Preparations for hardening are addressed in the following paragraphs.
   3.4.1. Selection of Candidates for Hardening. The responsibility for the selection of facilities and
   equipment that must be protected by hardening does not rest with the base civil engineer (BCE). The
   BCE is, however, responsible for ensuring that the hardening process is accomplished. Normally,
   items which are most essential to continuing the base mission receive priority for protection. Aircraft,
   command and control centers, personnel shelters, and communications centers are typical high-prior-
   ity facilities that are good candidates for hardening.
   3.4.2. Hardening Design. For permanent hardening, an engineer must perform a structural analysis
   to determine the hardening method. To perform this analysis, the threat, in terms of type of weapon
   (munitions), fuzing, size, angle of impact, etc., must be known. The engineer must also understand the
   function of the facility. For supplemental hardening or facility retrofits, this involves evaluating each
   structural component versus the expected weapon type and size. Because this analysis is very detailed,
   it is only conducted for permanent construction or peacetime retrofit of existing structures.
   3.4.3. Expedient Hardening Considerations and Factors. There are many ways to upgrade the
   hardness of existing non-hardened facilities and to protect critical resources from the effects of con-
   ventional weapons. This section outlines basic factors to consider and techniques for expedient hard-
   ening of facilities (see Table 3.2.).

                           Terrain.
                           Weather.

       3.4.3.1. Threat. Understanding threat weapons and their effects on facilities is the first step in
       selecting and designing hardening measures. The variety of weapons available for attacking Air
30                                                                  AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


     Force facilities is almost unlimited, ranging from small arms to heavy weapons delivered aerially.
     Weapon effects often occur in combination for greater lethality. The detonation of a general- pur-
     pose bomb is a good example of a one-two punch. The impact of high velocity fragments from the
     bomb casing can weaken a structure, making the blast wave immediately following detonation
     more effective in destroying the structure. Fragment and projectile penetration typically controls
     the design of the hardening method used. Additional information on weapons and their effects can
     be found in AFMAN 10-2602 (until rescinded by AFMAN 10-2502 Series publications), and UFC
     3-340-01.
     3.4.3.2. Resources and Facilities to Be Protected. Civil engineers should prepare a hardening
     analysis for each resource and facility to be upgraded. Each structural component should be eval-
     uated against the effects of the probable threat weapons and the expected duration of use to deter-
     mine design features. If aircraft are to be protected, consider the length, wingspan, and height of
     the aircraft. Also consider the layout of aircraft parking areas. If conducted in peacetime, these
     hardening analyses provide the basis for the installation's permanent and expedient hardening
     plans. Exhaustive field investigations and elaborate plans are not necessary, but adequate site
     investigations are important and help reduce the number of problems caused by immediate deci-
     sions based on a sense of urgency.
     3.4.3.3. Time. Normally, the nearer an air base is to the potential battle area, the more vital the
     time element becomes. Time is saved by efficient use of manpower, heavy equipment, hand tools,
     materials, and other facilities available. Good planning, scheduling, and supervision are needed
     during construction. Develop task priorities and assign crews and equipment to specific work
     areas to minimize travel. Sequence operations so all equipment is kept busy.
     3.4.3.4. Materials. Hardening materials act as either shielding (for protecting personnel or criti-
     cal resources), serve as structural components (to hold the shielding in place), or perform both
     functions at the same time. Shielding provides protection against penetration of projectiles and
     fragments, nuclear and thermal radiation, and the effects of fire and chemical agents. When time is
     limited, materials must be conserved, particularly those shipped from the continental United
     States (CONUS). Local materials should be used whenever practicable. Some possible hardening
     materials are discussed in the following paragraphs.
        3.4.3.4.1. Soil. Soil is generally the primary fill material for revetments and soil berms. Pro-
        jectile and fragment penetration in soil is based on three considerations: for materials of the
        same density, the finer the grain the greater the penetration; penetration decreases with
        increase in density; and penetration increases with greater water content.
        3.4.3.4.2. Soil Cement. Soil cement is used mostly for revetments which use sandbags in
        their construction. Soil cement can also be used in the construction of caps for earth revet-
        ments and to stabilize soil foundations under revetments. The standard ratios are one part
        cement to ten parts soil by weight or one part cement to six parts sand or gravel.
        3.4.3.4.3. Steel. Many expedient types of steel may be available for shielding. Sheet piling,
        steel landing mats, and culvert sections can be used in a protective structure as one of several
        composite materials. The thickness of these materials is a key factor in determining the overall
        penetration resistance of the revetment. Steel plate, only 1/6 the thickness of concrete, affords
        equal protection against small and intermediate caliber projectiles. Steel is also more likely to
        deform a projectile as it penetrates and is much less likely to spall than concrete. Steel sheets
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             31


        can be used to confine soil in a soil revetment. However, material with perforations larger than
        1/2 inch do not properly confine the soil material.
        3.4.3.4.4. Concrete. Concrete provides a very permanent revetment medium. If used with
        reinforcing bars or mesh, concrete is quite resistant to fragmentation shells. Reinforcing helps
        the concrete stay intact even after excessive cracking caused by penetration. When a shell or
        bomb explodes, its fragments travel faster than the blast wave. If these fragments strike the
        exposed concrete surfaces of a protective position, they can weaken the concrete to such an
        extent that the blast wave destroys it. Fragment strikes on exposed concrete surfaces may also
        cause spalls or pop-offs, on the inside surface of the concrete wall. Traveling at high speeds,
        the pop-offs create a hazard to personnel and materials on the inside. When possible, at least
        one layer of sandbags, placed on their short ends, or 15 inches of soil should cover all exposed
        concrete surfaces. Concrete construction requires skilled personnel and specialized equipment.
        Unfortunately, Portland cement may not be readily available after a conflict begins.
        3.4.3.4.5. Rock. In areas where rock is readily available, it can be an excellent hardening
        material. Fragment penetration into rock depends on the rock's physical properties and the
        number of joints, fractures, and other irregularities contained in the rock. Several layers of
        irregularly-shaped rock can change the angle of penetration. Hard rock can cause a projectile
        or fragment to flatten out or break up and stop penetration. Brick and masonry have the same
        protection characteristics and limitations as rock. Large rock is often used as a burster layer.
        3.4.3.4.6. Snow and Ice. Although snow and ice have only limited applications, they may
        occasionally be the only readily available materials in some areas. They should be used for
        shielding only. Weather changes can cause protective structures made of snow and ice to wear
        away or even collapse.
        3.4.3.4.7. Dimensioned Wood Timbers. Because of its low density and relatively low com-
        pressive strength, wood should generally be used only as structural support for survivability
        positions. Much greater thicknesses of wood than of soil are needed for protection from pene-
        tration. Timber is better used to construct retaining walls for earth or sandbag revetments or
        used to construct stand-offs. The timber may be hard or soft wood but should be free of knots
        or other imperfections that would affect its strength and resistance to penetration. Timber
        which is used against earth should be treated with tar or creosote to prevent decay.
        3.4.3.4.8. Plywood. Multiple layers of plywood can be used as a very effective field expedi-
        ent protective wall. The wall must be designed and constructed with sufficient braces and
        anchors to provide stability against blast. Most often plywood is used as a barrier to contain
        soil in a retaining wall or revetment.
        3.4.3.4.9. Logs. In heavily forested areas, timbers may be cut from existing woodlands and
        used to make log revetments. Logs can be better used as the walls in a soil bin revetment.
        3.4.3.4.10. Corrugated Metal. This material can be used to assemble revetment retaining
        walls and bulkheads. Since corrugated metal is not as rigid as landing mat and other steel
        material, it requires additional vertical and horizontal support to withstand the pressure of the
        earth fill.
        3.4.3.4.11. Boxes. Many types of boxes available on a typical installation can be filled with
        earth and used to construct a revetment. Ammunition boxes filled with earth provide some
        protection as retaining walls and bulkheads if they are adequately reinforced with vertical sup-
32                                                                       AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


           ports. CONEX or similar type containers filled with dry earth make formidable protective
           walls.
           3.4.3.4.12. Combined Materials. In most contingency situations, the availability of con-
           struction materials and skilled workers will likely be limited and will vary by installation. This
           might require a combination of expedient methods to insure that effective protection is sup-
           plied. In fact, if the materials are available, the combined use of materials normally results in a
           more effective revetment.
        3.4.3.5. Equipment and Labor. Selection of the hardening method should be based on resources
        required, resources available, and other subjective factors. As in any design situation, more than
        one solution may be possible or close to optimal. Adequate protection may also require the use of
        more than one method. For example, bin revetments may be selected to protect the structure walls
        while sandbags and loose soil are used to cover the roof. A number of innovative concepts are pos-
        sible for expedient hardening. Table 3.3. shows the equipment, labor, materials, and space
        required for the various methods. A quick screening of each of the methods can be performed
        using this table. For example, if space is very limited, soil berms are not usually an option. Also
        some methods such as sand grid forms require special materials.

7   Sandbags should be used to protect corners of revetment array.
8 Engineering design required for thickness of panel, sizing of air space, and design of structural

9   A variety of materials may be used, from plywood to asphalt to concrete to modern composites.
         3.4.3.6. Topography. The topography of the area near the deployment site should be considered
         when determining the protective requirements for parked aircraft, other vital assets, and key facil-
         ities. High ground within a range of 3,500 meters (11,483 feet) that offers good observation for
         effective mortar or direct fire may destroy the effectiveness of revetments unless the air base
         defense force plans for effective counter-fire. Similarly, wooded areas, villages, or other sites per-
         mitting concealment close to parked aircraft give opportunities for guerrillas and terrorists to
         assemble. These factors indicate a need for active defense measures in addition to passive fortifi-
         cation.
         3.4.3.7. Terrain. Slopes, drainage, vegetation, character of soil, likelihood of floods, and other
         conditions that may affect construction and layout should be studied.
         3.4.3.8. Effects of Soil Moisture. Wet soil may be used for revetments if dry material cannot be
         obtained, but it is uneconomical since larger quantities are required to resist penetration. Wet soil
         must be approximately one-half again as thick as dry soil to resist penetration by a given type of
         ammunition. Thus, selecting dry soil for earth revetments and providing a waterproof cover for
         them conserves manpower and materials. Of the various soils, wet clay can be penetrated most
         easily and is the least effective revetment material. Dry sand has the most resistance to penetration
         and therefore is the most desirable soil for revetment purposes. Soils with high moisture content,
         if not well protected from the elements, give way to erosion in a relatively short period.
         3.4.3.9. Impact of Weather. The local weather is an important factor in the development of hard-
         ened structures. Areas with high amounts of rainfall cause earth-filled revetments and sandbag
         structures to lose some of their effectiveness. Dampness also has an adverse effect on the durabil-
34                                                                       AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


        ity of other materials that are used in the hardening process. Wood rots and steel rusts quickly
        under these conditions unless well covered with protective coatings.
     3.4.4. Selection of the Hardening Method. Several hardening options may be suitable for a given
     situation. Soil berms provide the greatest level of protection for both single and multiple attacks,
     because of the large mass of earth that is typically used. Also, tests have shown that soil berms remain
     relatively intact through repeated attacks. Material blown from the face of the berm falls back onto the
     berm, and fragment and projectile penetration generally does not disturb stable berms. In general, any
     method that places a large mass of soil between the threat and the structure (or resource) provides
     good protection. Other methods include sandbags, sand grids, and bin revetments. These methods do
     not provide the level of multiple-attack protection provided by soil berms. They all depend on rela-
     tively vulnerable soil confining systems that tend to break down, allowing the soil to spill out on
     repeated attacks. Concrete modular revetments also provide good protection, although they do not
     provide the same level of protection afforded by a large mass of soil. Sacrificial panels have been
     shown to provide good protection levels since a significant amount of the destructive energy of the
     threat is dissipated in the breakup of the panel. However, sacrificial panels are better suited to
     semi-hardened structures that can withstand the impacts from the breakup of the panel and any frag-
     ments or projectiles that perforate the panels. Of course, as their name implies, sacrificial panels are
     not expected to provide multiple-attack protection.
        3.4.4.1. Soil Berms. Soil berms are among the oldest and simplest methods of providing
        improved and expedient protection to existing structures, personnel, and other assets. They are tra-
        ditional military field structures and have been used as breastworks throughout history. Berms are
        extremely effective in protecting against modern weapons, particularly when coupled with
        semi-hardened structures. Berms can be employed as freestanding structures, constructed against

         3.4.4.1.1. Threat Protection. Berms provide protection against near-miss general purpose
         bombs; high-explosive artillery rounds; rockets; and ballistic penetration. Soil berms can also
         be designed to defeat the effects of shaped charges. As freestanding structures, berms can be
         used to deny a direct line of sight to protected assets or a vulnerable area such as a door open-
         ing. Freestanding berms offer little protection from air blast effects. This is because the blast
         wave quickly reforms after passage over the berm. Consequently, freestanding structures are
         not recommended for applications requiring significant reductions in air blast pressure. How-
36                                                                  AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


        ever, tests have shown that berms constructed against a structural wall can dramatically reduce
        the damage from fragment impact and air blast.
        3.4.4.1.2. Multiple-Attack Protection. Freestanding soil berms and bermed walls provide
        good second or multiple-attack protection. This is principally due to the excellent protection
        against fragment penetration provided by soils and in part due to the geometry of the sloped
        face—material blown from the berm by the blast tends to fall back on the berm face.
        3.4.4.1.3. Limitations/Special Considerations. The main disadvantage of berms is their
        large space requirements. Berming may not be a practical hardening option for structures sited
        in very rocky terrains or where grading equipment is not available. At air base facilities, berms
        sited near taxiways and runways may exacerbate problems related to blowing dust and debris.
        Erosion control measures are particularly important under these circumstances. Generally,
        semi-hardened structures that were originally designed to withstand loadings associated with
        weapon effects have ample capacity to support additional dead loads associated with berming.
        The capacity of conventional wall structures must be investigated to determine the need for
        additional support. Simple earth berms and bermed walls can be effectively used in some
        instances by incorporating them into landscaping and energy management schemes for perma-
        nent facilities. In areas with ample rain, berms require frequent maintenance, especially if the
        sides and crest are not waterproofed, sodded, or sandbagged.
        3.4.4.1.4. Manpower. Preparing for an attack should be an installation-wide effort. Civil
        engineers will use their heavy equipment to move, place, and compact the soil. Unskilled labor
        from other units can complete tasks such as placing sod and sandbags and waterproofing and
        digging drainage channels.
     3.4.4.2. Sandbagging. Sandbagging is a traditional method of providing effective protection to
     walls and overhead structures. Sandbags can also be used to construct freestanding walls, revet-
     ments, and wall structures for protection of otherwise exposed assets. Sandbag revetments are
     practical expedient field fortifications, particularly when heavy equipment or skilled labor is in
     short supply. Figure 3.13. depicts how sandbags might be used to upgrade an existing structure.
        3.4.4.2.1. Other Uses. Sandbag structures can be used to protect vital resources from natural
        or man-made disasters. During a flood or hurricane, sandbag dikes can prevent important
        resources from being swept away or seriously damaged by high water. Sandbags could also be
        used in a man-made disaster, such as the rupture of a large fuel storage tank, to stop the spread
        of the highly flammable material. Civil engineers might use sandbags to contain the blast from
        a terrorist's bomb. Sandbags make effective temporary barriers to prevent access to critical
        installation areas during times of increased alert. They can also quickly replace protection lost
        through battle damage. A hole blasted in a permanent revetment could be temporarily filled
        with sandbags during a lull in the battle to provide protection during the next attack.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               37


Figure 3.13. Fortifying Shelter with Sandbags.




          3.4.4.2.2. Threat Protection. Sandbags placed against walls and over roofs are successful in
          protecting against near-miss and direct-hit high-explosive artillery rounds and direct ballistic
          impacts. Placed against walls, sandbags provide protection similar to that obtained from berm-
          ing with soil. A 16-inch layer of sandbags stacked against a 6-inch precast concrete wall pro-
          vides good protection against a 155 mm high-explosive artillery round detonated at a standoff
          of 5 feet.
          3.4.4.2.3. Multiple-Attack Protection. Sandbag berms, walls, and roof coverings provide
          multiple-attack protection to near-miss high-explosive threats similar to soil berms or soil cov-
          ers. However, the sandbag material tends to deteriorate, spilling the soil contents. Protected
          walls or roofs become vulnerable to a second attack unless repairs are made.
          3.4.4.2.4. Limitations/Special Considerations. The main limitation of sandbags, as com-
          pared with soil berms, is the time required to fill and place the bags. Older sandbags were sus-
          ceptible to rot, but newer bags with acrylic fabric remain serviceable for over two years with
          no signs of deterioration under all climatic conditions.
      3.4.4.3. Concrete Modular Revetments. Permanent revetments with integral foundations are
      usually associated with hardness upgrades and new facilities. Prefabricated concrete modular
      revetment units provide an expedient method for hardening structures and protecting exposed
      assets. Figure 3.14. shows a typical configuration for placing modular revetments to protect a
      building or key resource. The major distinguishing feature of modular revetments, when com-
      pared to other hardening measures, is their portability. Revetments can be bermed with soil to
      improve protection.

Figure 3.14. Configuration for Protecting a Building With Concrete Modular Revetments.




          3.4.4.3.1. Uses. Concrete modular revetments provide versatile, low-cost, relocatable, main-
          tenance-free and long-lasting protection for critical equipment and facilities (Figure 3.15.).
          They can be placed in aircraft parking areas, around buildings and equipment, and on and off
          paved surfaces. They can protect assets such as AGE, liquid oxygen storage tanks, WRM
          assets, and generators. They can be used to deny line-of-sight to doors and other vulnerable
          openings.

Figure 3.15. Concrete Modular Revetment Protects Key Equipment.




          3.4.4.3.2. Threat Protection. Concrete revetments can provide protection against fragments
          and air blast from near-miss general-purpose bombs and other lesser threats such as
          high-explosive artillery rounds, rockets, mortars, and small arms. An unbermed revetment
          provides good first strike protection but can suffer significant front face cratering and backface
          spall from fragment impacts. Bermed revetments improve protection for the revetment against
          fragment damage. Portable concrete revetment panels (6 inches thick) resist small arms fire
          but will not protect against a direct hit by a 122 mm rocket or larger weapon.
          3.4.4.3.3. Multiple-Attack Protection. Unbermed concrete revetments in practical wall
          thicknesses of 0.2 to 0.3 meters (approximately 7.9 inches to 11.8 inches), provide limited to
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               39


         moderate second attack protection from near-miss general-purpose bombs due to their suscep-
         tibility to fragment damage and movement. Bermed revetments provide excellent second
         attack protection. Panel displacements that create gaps between revetment units reduce the
         effectiveness of the revetment against second attack. This deficiency can be minimized by pro-
         viding connectors between the panels.
         3.4.4.3.4. Limitations/Special Considerations. Concrete revetments are limited by the
         resources necessary to fabricate and deploy them. Because it takes a lot of time to make them,
         their use as an expedient measure requires that they be prefabricated in peacetime before a
         disaster threatens or during an extended buildup phase before hostilities begin. Cranes and
         forklifts are required to position them. Modular, prefabricated revetments must be placed on a
         relatively smooth base (graded and compacted). Bermed concrete revetments have fairly large
         space requirements and other limitations associated with soil berms or bermed walls. The
         geometry of the aircraft revetment does not allow for turns and corners in the layout of an
         array of revetments. The base of Bitburg revetments has corners mitered at 45 degrees that
         allow for such turns and corners, but these corners are vulnerable to fragment penetration
         because the wall thicknesses of the two revetments just meet and do not lap. These corners
         should be protected with sandbags when time permits. The Bitburg revetment can be used to
         protect assets less than 6 feet in height.
      3.4.4.4. Bin Revetments. Bin revetments refer to hardening methods used to create vertical walls
      of soil, gravel, or rock rubble. Figure 3.16. shows the features of a generic bin revetment. Such
      systems are employed in the same way as soil berms, but combine the protective qualities of soil
      structures with efficient use of space. The thickness of the geologic medium is the primary means
      of providing protection. The wall structure consists of panels to confine the soil or rock plus a
      structure to hold the panels in place. Spacers hold the walls apart at specified distances while ties
      keep the walls from separating under the soil load. In some bins, these functions are performed by
      the structure itself. A weather cover keeps the soil fill dry.

Figure 3.16. Double Wall Bin Revetment.




         3.4.4.4.1. Types of Bin Revetments. There are many variations and life spans to soil bins.
         Some are permanent while others have only a limited life. Two types of soil bins are B-1 steel
         bins and HESCO barrier revetments (Figure 3.17. and Figure 3.18.).
40                                                                    AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


          3.4.4.4.2. Threat Protection. Bin revetments provide essentially the same protection as other
          earth walls. They can also be used to deny line-of-sight to doors and other vulnerable open-
          ings. Two of the more important factors in determining the total effectiveness of a revetment
          system are the height of the revetment compared to the resource it is protecting and the config-
          uration of the revetment around the resource.

Figure 3.18. Engineers Fill HESCO Barrier Revetment With Soil.




          3.4.4.4.3. Multiple-Attack Protection. Multiple-attack protection is tied to the durability
          and resistance of the structural system containing the geologic material. Once fragment dam-
          age destroys the confining system, little second attack protection is provided since the bin
          revetment is reduced to rubble and acts only as a small breastwork. Bin revetments using steel
          or reinforced concrete confining systems provide good second attack protection.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               41


         3.4.4.4.4. Limitation/Special Considerations. Soil bin revetments generally require signifi-
         cant construction resources. If built of expedient materials, they tend to be temporary mea-
         sures. Constructed of reinforced concrete or masonry, they are usually part of permanent
         upgrades or new facility construction.
      3.4.4.5. Sand Grids. Sand grids were originally developed as a soil-confining system for use in
      roadway construction over loose soils. Testing has demonstrated that sand grids are also an effec-
      tive and versatile method of providing expedient hardening. Sand grids are essentially soil struc-
      tures and are similar to soil berms and sandbags in their use. The principal advantages of using
      sand grids over soil berms are ease of construction, reduced space requirements, and fewer erosion
      problems. Sand grids are prefabricated plastic forms shaped like cells of a honeycomb (Figure
      3.19.) and filled with granular material such as sand, gravel, or other soil (Figure 3.20.). The sand
      grid form is available in a standard configuration or a newer, notched configuration. The notched
      configuration allows for development of a lapped joint between layers that prevents leakage of the
      fill material. Currently available sand grids are 38 inches wide in place. Sand grids are durable and
      will not rot.
         3.4.4.5.1. Threat Protection. Sand grids can provide efficient and effective protection
         against near-miss general-purpose bombs, high-explosive artillery rounds, shoulder-launched
         rockets, and machine gun fire. Sand grids are very effective in protecting semi-hardened walls
         from near-miss general-purpose bomb fragments and air blast.

Figure 3.20. Gravel-Filled Sand Grid.




          3.4.4.5.2. Multiple-Attack Protection. Sand grid revetments provide limited second attack
          protection from near-miss general-purpose bombs. In other applications against less severe
          threats, such as near-miss high-explosive artillery rounds, sand grid revetments provide excel-
          lent second attack protection. As overhead protection, sand grids provide limited second attack
          protection against direct-hit mortar and high-explosive artillery but can be repaired with loose
          soil or sand bags.
          3.4.4.5.3. Limitations/Special Considerations. Perforations in the face of the sand grid
          cause spilling of fill material from damaged cells. The fill material used in unnotched sand
          grids is susceptible to washing by rains unless a sheet material (fabric or plastic) is placed
          between layers. The notched grid is not susceptible to rain damage. The maximum free-stand-
          ing height for use as a protective structure against conventional weapons is about 8 feet. The
          grid also requires significant amounts of fill.
      3.4.4.6. Predetonation Screens. Predetonation screens are erected in front of a facility or fight-
      ing position to detonate an incoming antitank weapon at a standoff distance (Figure 3.21.). In
      doing so, screens may supplement the protection inherent in the protected structure or position and
      reduce structure damage. The screen can be constructed of wood, fencing, etc. It is usually con-
      structed between 10 to 40 feet from the structures it is intended to protect. Although pre-detona-
      tion screens may could damage the fuse on the weapon, causing it to dud, structures being
      protected must still be capable of defeating the kinetic energy of the fired round. For additional
      information on constructing and siting pre-detonation screens, refer to UFC 4-020-03FA, Security
      Engineering: Final Design.

       3.4.4.7. Unconventional Hardening. In extreme, time-critical situations, none of the previously
       discussed hardening methods may be suitable, and hardening by unconventional means may be
       considered. For example, under threat of a terrorist attack or similar emergency, pseudo revet-
       ments can be set up using dump trucks, buses, bulldozers, or other heavy equipment to act as a
       shield for high-value or mission-critical base assets. Obviously, one must weigh the risk involved
       versus the possible destruction of the equipment used as a shield. The point is: do not overlook any
       technique simply because it is not one of the “standard” hardening methods.
   3.4.5. Summary. As you can see, expedient hardening includes standard and non-standard hardening
   techniques. Improvisation is often required to compensate for the lack of traditional construction
   materials or specialized equipment. Use expedient methods to take advantage of available local mate-
   rials and terrain features. AFH 10-222, Volume 14, and the Joint Forward Operations Base (JFOB)
   Force Protection Handbook, provide methods to select and construct expedient hardening measures.
   These methods are suitable for expeditionary operations and are effective against a wide range of air
   base threats. Most methods require only a simple analysis and plan. Unit personnel with minimal
   training can accomplish expedient hardening. Recognize that the most effective hardening measures
   may not be best to employ under every situation. Consider factors such as the estimated construction
   time, manpower and equipment availability, life-span requirement, and availability of materials.
   Implement specific actions based on these considerations and the decision of the senior Air Force
   commander. For more information on specific hardening criteria and procedures, refer to the refer-
   ences in Table 3.4.

3.5. Dispersal. Dispersal is the separation or relocation of resources, preferably away from a threat or
pending disaster, for the purpose of increasing survivability. Dispersal has a role at CONUS, overseas,
permanent, and bare bases. Dispersal can be incorporated into everyday installation operations through
intelligent facility siting. Usually, however, dispersal is viewed as an expedient measure to protect impor-
tant installation resources from a pending disaster or wartime threat by temporarily relocating them.
Include dispersal plans in the CEMP 10-2, In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plans (IGESP), and Expedi-
tionary Site Plans (ESP).
   3.5.1. Planning and Preparing for Dispersal. Effective temporary dispersal depends upon the cir-
   cumstance dictating dispersal and the location where resources are dispersed. For example, dispersing
   personnel and equipment into a wooded area prior to a hurricane could cause greater injury and dam-
   age from falling branches and trees than if the resources remained in the open. However, the same
   action prior to a hostile attack could save lives and protect equipment by removing them from likely
44                                                                       AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


     target areas and providing concealment from enemy forces. As discussed in this volume, seven steps
     are involved in planning and preparing for resource dispersal. Those steps are outlined in Figure 3.22.
     and discussed below. Because dispersal is an installation-wide effort, all units should provide inputs to
     each step.

Figure 3.22. Dispersal Planning and Preparation Flowchart.




        3.5.1.1. Determine the Threats and Identify Vulnerable Resources. As used here, a threat can
        be a man-made or natural disaster as well as an enemy attack. Each installation must decide what
        threats it faces and which resources are vulnerable for each threat.
        3.5.1.2. Identify What Resources and Functions Should Be Dispersed. Usually, these are the
        high-value or critical mission and support assets that are not protected by other measures. Each
        unit should identify key resources to disperse for each threat and outline the priority in which they
        should be dispersed. The major consideration is usually how important a resource is towards con-
        tinuing or reestablishing the base mission or recovery effort. Personnel should be high on the list
        if there are not shelters for everyone. No two bases have exactly the same requirements; therefore,
        each base should carefully evaluate needs and assign dispersal priorities.
        3.5.1.3. Select Candidate Dispersal Sites. Dispersal sites that are to be used during hostile
        attacks should be located away from the high-threat areas of the installation and provide conceal-
        ment and protection from attacking forces. Look for multiple dispersal sites to increase resource
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                  45


     survivability. Select sites on base, or convenient to it, with at least two access routes. Choose sites
     that provide good natural cover and concealment, and avoid open areas. Pick sites which need the
     least amount of advance preparation. Sites with in-place facilities, utilities, and communications
     are ideal if they are not easily identified as targets in their own right. Avoid recommending sites
     where radio contact with the base cannot be established. Ideally, each site should have pavement
     for parking vehicles or the soil should be capable of supporting fully loaded, wheeled vehicles
     during wet weather. Adequate security is needed for sites with mission-critical or high-value
     items. Some examples of areas to consider as possible dispersal locations are discussed in the fol-
     lowing paragraphs
        3.5.1.3.1. Aircraft Hangars. Under certain conditions, such as a hurricane evacuation or fly-
        ing unit deployment, base aircraft are relocated to other installations. At such times, you may
        be able to use these facilities for dispersal and protection of some equipment. If hangar doors
        are opened electrically, be sure there are alternative procedures to open them during power
        outages. Keep in mind that hangars may be a target during wartime.
        3.5.1.3.2. Munitions Storage Areas. Some installations have abandoned or unused muni-
        tions storage facilities that are ideal dispersal points for resources. These structures are usually
        hardened and provide substantial protection from the destructive effects of a major disaster.
        Special arrangements may have to be made if hardened structures interfere with radio commu-
        nications. In peacetime, munitions bunkers can shield vehicles and equipment from the effects
        of high winds if the vehicles and equipment are placed close enough.
        3.5.1.3.3. Base Housing. When hostilities are expected in overseas areas, military dependents
        will be relocated stateside, time permitting. Vacant base housing units can then be used as dis-
        persal areas for personnel as well as beddown facilities for incoming forces.
        3.5.1.3.4. Off-Base Warehouses and Storage Facilities. Depending on the location, civilian
        warehouses or other storage facilities near the installation may be rented as temporary dis-
        persal locations during an emergency. Railheads and port facilities in the vicinity of the instal-
        lation make good dispersal facilities, but they may also be targets.
        3.5.1.3.5. Recreation Halls/Gymnasiums. Large base structures such as recreation halls and
        gymnasiums could be used during emergencies as temporary dispersal points or emergency
        shelters for personnel. Facilities of this type should be evaluated carefully to ensure that they
        provide adequate protection from the anticipated threat.
     3.5.1.4. Dispersed Base Layout and Pattern. Figure 3.23. shows a conceptual base layout and
     dispersal pattern. Base planners should consider these concepts when siting facilities or selecting
     dispersal sites.
        3.5.1.4.1. Aircraft. When aircraft are not sheltered or revetted, random dispersal of parked
        aircraft increases their survivability during an attack. When attacked by aircraft dropping gen-
        eral purpose bombs, the survivability rate increases from two to four times when aircraft usu-
        ally parked at 50-foot separations are dispersed to irregular parking with minimum separations
        of 300 feet. An aircraft dispersal plan should consider operational requirements, maintenance,
        installation security, existing parking areas, and the availability of real estate for additional air-
        craft parking.

Figure 3.23. Dispersed Base Layout.




          3.5.1.4.2. Generators. Base power generating plants should be located in a minimum of two
          separate areas. Where there are several individual generators at each location, they should be
          positioned with adequate separation or revetting between each unit to provide maximum sur-
          vivability.
          3.5.1.4.3. Munitions. Accidental or deliberate detonation of stored munitions is reduced by
          maximum separation between explosives and other resources. Explosives should be dispersed
          into small compatible groups. Ammunition should not be located near an installation perimeter
          where exposed ammunition could easily be damaged by small arms fire. Consider splitting key
          storage or other munitions operations into sub-operations.
          3.5.1.4.4. Petroleum, Oils, Lubricants (POL). Fuel should not be stored on the perimeter of
          an area where it could easily be damaged by small arms.
          3.5.1.4.5. Vehicles and Heavy Equipment. Motor vehicles should not be pooled. Parking
          motor vehicles under or beside trees, next to earthen embankments, or behind buildings (Fig-
          ure 3.24.) provides partial concealment as well as dispersal. The “harder” the structure—the
          better, but not if that structure is likely to be targeted by the enemy.

Figure 3.24. Dispersing Key Equipment Behind Buildings.




      3.5.1.5. Decide Who and What Goes to Each Dispersal Site. When deciding where to disperse
      specific assets or functions, consider factors such as resource priority, distance to dispersal sites,
      how hard a resource is to move, and how much advance warning time is likely. Split capabilities
      and do not cluster vital assets. Do not concentrate personnel with the same specialty in one spot.
      Likewise, do not put all equipment, vehicles, and response teams of the same type in one place. If
      possible, keep dispersed personnel within easy walking distance of their equipment; this improves
      the success of the dispersal. Airfield damage repair (ADR) equipment and materials should be dis-
      persed to at least three separate sites. When selecting dispersed shelters for damage assessment
      response teams (DARTs), ensure each team is able to maintain communications with the DCC
      either by land line or radio. Maintain team integrity of DARTs; however, do not place more than
      one team in the same dispersed location. This action provides a degree of redundancy in the event
      one or more of the shelters is hit. If there is a choice of shelters for the DARTs, choose shelters that
      are closest to the DCC. This eases the reassembly of the teams and subsequent flow of information
      to the teams from the DCC. Try not to overload a dispersal site.
      3.5.1.6. Arrange for Support Needed at Each Site. Selected services, facilities, utilities, and
      communications may be required at dispersal sites under certain circumstances. However, plan-
      ners should attempt to minimize the amount of centralized support required at each site; none is
      the ideal. Units and individuals should provide their own support whenever possible. Each person
      can carry his or her own sleeping bag, food, water, and cold weather gear. Work details can be
      formed from each dispersed unit to provide services such as obtaining water, digging latrines,
      erecting tents, removing refuse, and operating the contamination control area (CCA). Identify and
      consider resources normally available at the site or in the nearby area. Provide only limited sup-
      port in the short term—enough for survival. Increase support as the duration of the dispersal
      increases. Each installation must determine its own priorities for providing this support. As a min-
      imum, consider the following items and provide for them in dispersal plans.
         3.5.1.6.1. Shelters or Tents. Personnel can sleep in or under vehicles for a day or two if
         required. Facilities may be required to shelter personnel from the elements, especially if per-
         sonnel must disperse frequently or for extended periods. Units may transport and erect their
         own tents, if available.
48                                                                AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


     3.5.1.6.2. Sleeping Bags, Blankets, and Cots. Individuals should carry their own sleeping
     bags; blankets can substitute for sleeping bags. If not already issued when the dispersal order
     is given, make arrangements to have these items pulled from unit mobility gear storage area,
     or base supply, and delivered to the dispersal site. This especially applies when dispersing dur-
     ing cold weather or for long durations. Cots are a nice-to-have item for frequent or long-term
     dispersals.
     3.5.1.6.3. Food. Individuals should carry enough Meals, Ready to Eat (MREs) to last a couple
     of days; if necessary, units can carry more MREs for longer periods. Explore food service
     options with the services squadron if dispersing for more than seven days.
     3.5.1.6.4. Water. Individuals should disperse with full canteens or bottled water. Water must
     be available at the dispersal sites or arrangements made to deliver it after two days. Treating a
     nearby water source is an option if equipment is available.
     3.5.1.6.5. Electrical Power. Arrange for generator power and limited distribution for the few
     dispersed functions that may need power.
     3.5.1.6.6. Fuel Storage and Dispensing (Vehicle and Heating Fuels). If the dispersal site is
     not near the installation, some capability to refuel vehicles and provide heating fuels may be
     necessary. A small refueling truck from base supply is one option. That same truck could also
     be used to provide fuel to expedient storage and dispensing points at more than one dispersal
     site. Bladders, and even 55-gallon drums, can be used to store or transport fuel. Even at dis-
     persal sites, fuels must be stored away from shelters and other resources to minimize the
     explosive hazard.
     3.5.1.6.7. Sanitation (Latrines and Refuse Collection). Each site must provide a way to
     collect and dispose of human and solid waste to prevent a public health problem. Expedient
     latrines are sufficient for human waste. Generally, a refuse pit periodically covered with a
     layer of soil is sufficient for solid waste.
     3.5.1.6.8. Vehicle Maintenance. If necessary, request that the transportation squadron pro-
     vide a maintenance capability at the dispersal site, or place a mobile maintenance truck on
     standby. Do not forget to make spare parts available for key equipment. If maintenance and
     repair procedures are unique, consider taking maintenance technical orders for special equip-
     ment.
     3.5.1.6.9. Communications With Dispersed Forces. Skilled personnel, critical equipment,
     and valuable materials are not normally dispersed to an area and left to operate on their own.
     To effectively use these forces, command personnel must maintain communications with dis-
     persal sites. Dispersed forces must be kept informed of conditions at the base and kept ready to
     respond. If a dispersal site is permanently established, consider installing a land line telephone
     or making cellular phones available to stay in contact with the base. At sites where a telephone
     connection is not feasible or when telephones are inoperative, a radio network can be used.
     Other communications measures that may be employed include runners, signal flags, and sig-
     nal lights. Any communication method used is appropriate so long as the message received is
     the same as the one sent. If signals are used, their meanings must be prearranged and simple.
     If necessary, use intermediate locations to relay messages; another dispersal site that is closer
     to the main base could serve this function. When making plans, the base must decide who
     maintains contact with the dispersed forces: the installation control center (ICC), the emer-
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              49


        gency operations center (EOC), or unit control centers (UCC) for their own personnel. For
        multiple on-base sites, UCCs can generally perform a better job. At off-base sites with multi-
        ple organizations, the ICC or the EOC may elect to maintain communications and provide
        direction.
        3.5.1.6.10. Transportation. Decisions must be made as to how personnel, vehicles, and
        equipment will be moved. This can be a unit responsibility, a consolidated base effort, or a
        combination. For extended dispersals prior to hostilities, units may use their own vehicles to
        transport personnel and equipment as required. Base shuttles may be set up to run scheduled
        routes for long-term dispersals.
        3.5.1.6.11. Contamination Control Area (CCA) Operations. In a CBRN environment, dis-
        persal sites should be in toxic-free areas if possible. To process personnel, vehicles, and equip-
        ment into and out of the dispersal site, a contamination control area and a vehicle/equipment
        decontamination station must be set up, manned, and operated. The responsibility for these
        tasks can be assigned to one unit permanently, to all units on a rotation, or to CCA teams
        formed by detailing individuals from the different units at the site. For around-the-clock oper-
        ations, at least two—preferably three—CCA teams are required. Decide who will set up the
        CCA and who will supervise the CCA teams. See AFMAN 32-4005, Personnel Protection
        and Attack Actions, (until rescinded by AFMAN 10-2502 Series publications) for tips on CCA
        set up. Plans should specify who will obtain, store, and maintain CCA equipment and materi-
        als.
        3.5.1.6.12. Security. At on-base sites, units should expect to provide security for their own
        assets. This does not mean the assets have to be guarded on a full-time basis; each installation
        and situation is different. Civil engineers should work out details with the security forces.
        When off base at overseas locations, additional security is required. Depending upon the loca-
        tion, the civilian countryside surrounding an overseas air base may be relatively peaceful or
        extremely hostile. Even during peacetime dispersals, security remains an important consider-
        ation. Resources available from base security forces, US Army units, or host nation security
        forces determine the level of protection available to dispersed assets. Civil engineers and other
        units at the dispersal site may be called upon to assist the security forces.
     3.5.1.7. Develop the Base and Unit Dispersal Plans. The base plan provides the big picture,
     such as what units disperse and where. The unit dispersal plans identify what specific resources
     and which personnel disperse and how dispersal is accomplished.
        3.5.1.7.1. Base Dispersal. The base dispersal plan should detail which units disperse, where
        each goes, under what conditions dispersal will be necessary, the priority of the resources, who
        provides what support, and the command and control structure. When more than one unit is
        dispersed to the same location, the plan may outline which part of the site each unit occupies.
        However, do not expect this level of detail very often. The plan should clearly outline the com-
        mand and control structure, especially for off-base sites, to control the initial chaos and to
        direct site operations during extended stays. It is reasonable to expect that the senior ranking
        person will be in charge. The plan could also designate a lead unit and the senior person of that
        unit to be in charge. Civil engineers should be prepared to offer recommendations to the senior
        leader with regard to “facility” siting, utilities, sanitation, hardening, and CCA operations. Do
        not discuss locations of off-base wartime dispersal sites. Keeping them a secret may be impos-
        sible, but do not draw attention to them. Have enough alternate sites established so you can
50                                                                      AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


        keep an enemy guessing where the actual dispersal site is located. When dispersal plans are
        exercised, alternate deployments between each site to avoid tipping off which site is favored
        among all locations. If dispersal plans are to another installation or location far from the home
        base, convoys or other mass transportation efforts will have to be planned.
        3.5.1.7.2. Unit Dispersal. The unit plan provides the specifics. It should identify personnel,
        equipment, and vehicles to disperse, in what priority order, and to what location. Specify who
        moves which vehicles and equipment items, and designate where repair materials will be
        located. The methods of dispersal are generally determined by the distance to the dispersal
        site. Powered equipment may be driven to dispersal sites on base; other equipment may be
        transported by truck or similar vehicle, or personnel may physically carry smaller pieces of
        equipment and materials. To the greatest extent possible, disperse resources by teams.
            3.5.1.7.2.1. Create dispersal checklists and load plans. The checklists should include items
            such as obtaining food, water, sleeping bags, chemical warfare ensembles, tents, camou-
            flage netting, hand tools, shovels, picks, sandbags, and extra consumables (oil, grease,
            hydraulic fluid, air filters, etc.) and servicing vehicles (fuel, engine oil, air in tires, jacks,
            spare tires, etc.). The load plans should identify what items are to be loaded on each vehi-
            cle. Load plans minimize confusion and ensure the most important assets are moved first.
            3.5.1.7.2.2. If possible, inspect designated dispersal sites in advance. Determine what site
            improvements are required before and after dispersal. Decide what support items should be
            taken and estimate how much.
            3.5.1.7.2.3. Perform operational checks and service equipment before dispersal. To save
            time later, load vehicles with repair materials likely needed early on during base recovery.
            3.5.1.7.2.4. When preparing for enemy attack, disperse at night, if possible. This conceal-
            ment is especially important in the desert where dust from moving vehicles can reveal
            activity and your position. Be sure to cover vehicle tracks to and from a dispersal area.
            3.5.1.7.2.5. When dispersed, use natural and man-made features to hide assets. Park vehi-
            cles close to buildings and in shadows. Do not position assets in open areas or in straight
            lines where a single bomb or strafing run can destroy many assets. Attempt to position pri-
            ority vehicles where they are easily accessible to avoid moving other assets to get to them.
            Position assets to allow the observation of personnel and equipment on either side of them.
     3.5.1.8. Enhancing Dispersal Sites. This is the last step. With proper site selection and limited
     site support, advance preparations can be eliminated or minimized. However, units can make good
     use of their time after dispersal by improving such things as shelters, facility hardening, and fight-
     ing positions at their dispersal sites (Figure 3.25.).
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                 51

   3.5.2. Hasty Planning and Preparations. Ideally, dispersal planning is accomplished during the lei-
   sure of peacetime, but not every contingency can be foreseen. If the unit only has time for hasty plan-
   ning, the common sense steps outlined above still apply. Just do not labor over the options. Quickly
   decide which of your resources are most important to protect and go with the most obvious. From per-
   sonal knowledge of the installation and the surrounding area, determine which sites are best for dis-
   persal. Decide how to move the resources and who will do it. Determine what communication
   methods will be used to keep all unit personnel informed, and ensure all personnel understand how
   this is to be accomplished when dispatched. Ideally, each vehicle group traveling between the installa-
   tion and a dispersal site should have at least one working radio.
   3.5.3. CONUS CE Dispersal Guidance. The primary purpose of dispersal in CONUS is to escape
   the destruction of natural disasters and to get personnel and priority assets out of harms way. Some
   installations may support a survival, recovery, and reconstitution (SRR) plan which calls for dispersal.
      3.5.3.1. On-Base Dispersal. When establishing CONUS on-base dispersal sites, resources
      should be identified for pre-positioning at the locations to save time during dispersal. Materials
      that do not have a critical shelf life, such as sand, gravel, and other building items, are good candi-
      dates for pre-positioned dispersal. A remote fuel storage facility at the dispersal location ensures
      that dispersal force vehicles can continue to operate if main fuel storage facilities are damaged or
      destroyed. If personnel are relocated to the dispersal site for an extended period of time, utilities,
      billeting, and food service will be required.
      3.5.3.2. Dispersal to Other Military Installations. If the civil engineer unit is required to dis-
      perse resources to another installation during an emergency, numerous details must be considered.
      Transportation arrangements are a primary concern. When reasonable distances are involved, a
      truck convoy may constitute the best method. Qualified personnel should supervise the loading
      and movement of the convoy. Seemingly insignificant details overlooked during transportation
      planning have a tendency to become large problems during convoy movements. During disasters,
      as in war, transportation routes tend to become overloaded with military and civilian traffic. Sound
52                                                                   AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


     convoy procedures should be followed. Close coordination with the receiving installation is essen-
     tial. The BCE should appoint an experienced person to coordinate billeting and food service sup-
     port upon arrival at the receiving installation. Communications capabilities should also be
     assessed to ensure that contact can be maintained with the dispersing force throughout the move-
     ment and subsequent stay at the dispersal site.
     3.5.3.3. Dispersal to Civilian Locations. If a situation arises where this type of dispersal
     becomes necessary under peacetime conditions, the BCE must ensure that close coordination is
     established with local property owners and civilian government officials. Approval of the property
     owner must be obtained, and civil engineer personnel must carefully document any property dam-
     age that occurs as a result of the dispersal. This documentation greatly facilitates the handling of
     any claims for reimbursement following the dispersal. If civilian dispersal locations are a reason-
     able alternative for a CONUS BCE during a peacetime emergency, consider negotiating prior use
     or rental agreements with civilian property owners or local community officials. Dispersal to civil-
     ian locations should only be done after careful consideration of on-base and other military base
     alternatives.
     3.5.3.4. Dispersal During Survival, Recovery, and Reconstitution (SRR) Plan Implementa-
     tion. The SRR plan is intended to improve survival and enhance recovery and reconstitution oper-
     ations for CONUS air force installations under threat of nuclear attack. Not all CONUS civil engi-
     neer units have responsibilities under an SRR plan. For those installations that do, the BCE and
     staff should carefully review the local SRR plan to determine specific actions required during
     implementation. The general SRR concept of operations during various attack phases follows.
        3.5.3.4.1. Attack Preparation Period. If responsibilities have been previously identified,
        civil engineer forces may be deployed to dispersal installations to support beddown of other
        dispersed forces. Additionally, the BCE should send key personnel and equipment to safe
        locations away from likely target areas so that they are available for recovery operations at
        their home installation or at a regroup installation following the attack.
        3.5.3.4.2. Attack Response Period. Assuming they are not under direct attack, the activities
        of the dispersed force during this time are concentrated on keeping critical facilities and utili-
        ties in operation, supporting the deployed force, and maintaining the capability to support the
        attack recovery mission. Civil engineer personnel may be required to operate emergency elec-
        trical generators, isolate utilities, and provide other emergency engineer services.
        3.5.3.4.3. Attack Recovery Period. During this phase, dispersed civil engineer resources can
        be most valuable. These assets may be the only military resources capable of restoring remain-
        ing installations to an operational status. Reconstitution bases will be designated, and the dis-
        persed forces will likely be called upon to make any expedient repairs required to accept and
        beddown forces deployed or recovering to those installations. The type of work expected from
        dispersed forces at this time could range from debris clearance and airfield damage repairs to
        construction of a tent city.
        3.5.3.4.4. Civil Resource Requirements. Emergency contractual support and materials will
        be required from local sources for rehabilitation of damaged installations or conversion of
        civilian airstrips for military use. For installations with an SRR responsibility, civil engineer
        resource requirements should be identified and local sources listed for each dispersal or recon-
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              53


         stitution base contemplated for SRR operations. It should be assumed that during wartime con-
         ditions these resources would be available through emergency requisition.
  3.5.4. Overseas CE Dispersal Guidance. An overseas civil engineer uses dispersal as a means of
  resource protection for many of the same reasons as a CONUS BCE. In addition, the overseas civil
  engineer should consider dispersal as a means of protecting resources from CBRNE attacks. Forces at
  an overseas air base might be dispersed to a remote location on base, to a collocated operating base
  (COB), or to a civilian location.
     3.5.4.1. On-Base Dispersal Locations. Overseas civil engineers, like their CONUS counter-
     parts, should select locations on the main base which provide optimum protection against any
     foreseeable disaster. An area of difference is protection against CBRNE attacks. The overseas air
     base is more vulnerable to a CBRNE attack than a CONUS location; therefore, emphasis should
     be given to selecting multiple dispersal sites removed from the likely target areas of the installa-
     tion. Dispersal locations removed from prime air base target areas (such as runways, command
     and control centers, POL facilities, and munitions storage areas) contribute to the preservation of
     resources during an attack. Once these sites have been identified, develop physical protection
     methods for each location as further resource protection. Fire Emergency Services (FES) should
     be located in close proximity to the operational infrastructure and should be given special consid-
     eration for dispersal locations, concealment, and physical protection.
     3.5.4.2. COB Dispersal Locations. A COB is an allied installation that can be used to beddown
     augmenting forces. Close coordination with the host installation agencies is a primary requirement
     during any dispersal to a COB. An important aspect of dispersal to a COB is the cultural, proce-
     dural, and language differences that civil engineer personnel must overcome.
     3.5.4.3. Dispersal to Civilian Locations. Dispersal to a civilian location in an overseas environ-
     ment is much more complicated than it would be in a CONUS area. The laws of each country dif-
     fer, and there may be no existing status-of-forces agreements for obtaining rights to use local
     property as a dispersal site. Again, the base must evaluate needs and determine if off-base dis-
     persal sites would serve a useful purpose. If these sites are determined to be necessary, discuss the
     possibility of negotiated agreements with the base legal staff, your MAJCOM, and representatives
     of the host government. Negotiations with foreign property owners are best left to members of the
     host government.
  3.5.5. Summary. Temporary dispersal is a relatively inexpensive and expedient method to protect
  important installation assets from the effects of disasters and enemy attack, but some advance warning
  is required to mobilize personnel and assets. The value of wartime dispersal can be improved by
  employing supplemental protection and hardening measures. For information on specific dispersal
  criteria and procedures, refer to the reference documents in Table 3.5.

3.6. Antiterrorism Measures. Antiterrorism measures help ensure adequate protection of personnel and
assets critical to air base operations. Although, the installation Force Protection Working Group (FPWG)
or Antiterrorism Officer (ATO) identifies appropriate force protection and antiterrorism requirements,
civil engineers also play an important role in the planning, design, and development of antiterrorism and
force protection measures. For more specific actions to increase a facility’s physical and passive protec-
tion against terrorist activities, see AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiterrorism (AT) Standards, and the reference
documents listed in Table 3.6.

3.7. CBRN Passive Defensive Measures. If an adversary succeeds in launching a CBRN attack and
active defense measures fail to eliminate the delivery vehicle and/or weapons, passive defense will be
essential. Civil engineers play a prominent role in CBRN passive defense. Passive defensive measures are
designed to improve the capability of personnel to survive and sustain operations in CBRN environments
and are organized into four capability areas: sense, shape, shield, and sustain.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              55


  3.7.1. Sense. Sense activities provide commanders with up-to-date information on CBRN threats by
  detecting, identifying, and qualifying/quantifying hazards. Obtaining this information requires accu-
  rate assessments in a number of areas to include sampling, detection, and identification. CBRN detec-
  tion, sampling, and identification are multifaceted and multifunctional operations and include CBRN
  point and standoff detection systems; medical, food, and water surveillance; and attack preparation
  and Post Attack Reconnaissance (PAR) for unexploded explosive ordnance by unit and installation
  PAR teams. Point detection systems continue to improve and incorporate rapid identification capabil-
  ities. Epidemiological surveillance conducted by public health and medical personnel also contributes
  to detecting biological weapons exposure, low-level chemical agent exposure (below current instru-
  ment detection levels), and radiation exposure. Airmen also serve as a key component of the sensing
  architecture. They should be trained to sense indications of impending or actual CBRN attacks, report
  those indications, and take the immediate and prudent actions necessary to protect themselves and
  mission resources.
  3.7.2. Shape. Shaping is the characterization of CBRN hazards to accurately describe the current and
  future operational picture to the commander. Passive defense activities that allow a commander to
  shape the operational environment include CBRN effects predictions, meteorological condition
  assessments, gaining situational awareness and predicting future events, establishing protected bed-
  down locations to mitigate CBRN effects, and identifying health risks to ensure a fit and healthy fight-
  ing force. Intelligence, civil engineering, and weather experts provide predictions on the nature of the
  threat. For meteorological condition assessments, weather experts supply information on terrain,
  weather conditions, and other meteorological data, while CE readiness CBRN experts provide accu-
  rate predictions about the type of agent, release point, and the plume (footprint of the contaminated
  area).
  3.7.3. Shield. Shielding includes protecting forces from harmful effects and hazards of CBRN
  threats. Shielding may be accomplished through activities to prevent, mitigate, and minimize CBRN
  exposure effects (including the administration of vaccines and prophylaxis) or through contamination
  avoidance to prevent or reduce exposures. Passive defense activities which allow a commander to
  shield warfighting forces include disease and casualty prevention, contamination avoidance, contami-
  nation control, and protective countermeasures. Disease and casualty prevention includes steps taken
  to prevent casualties before attack and to minimize casualties after a CBRN attack. Contamination
  avoidance includes actions taken to minimize the impact of CBRN attacks by eliminating exposure to
  contamination. While operating in a CBRN environment, contamination control prevents secondary
  transfer of disease and chemical, biological or radiological material and/or re-aerosolization of an
  agent. Contamination control includes avoiding, reducing, removing, or rendering harmless the haz-
  ards from CBRN contamination.
  3.7.4. Sustain. Sustainment activities enable the commander to sustain operations or facilitate the
  return to operational capability as soon as possible. These activities include identifying hazardous
  areas through PAR, notifying personnel, and decontaminating and managing casualties, as needed.
  Decontamination and health risk assessments are important first steps toward a return to operational
  capability. Effective decontamination operations help sustain or enhance the flow of operations by
  preventing or minimizing performance degradation, casualties, or loss of material (Figure 3.26.).
56                                                                      AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008

     3.7.5. Other Passive Defensive Measures. Installation CBRN defense actions should focus on
     attack detection and warning, protection, and mitigation of specific threats and threat weapon systems.
     Although not all inclusive, Table 3.7. list a few examples of passive defensive measures that installa-
     tions may take. See Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD) 2-1.8, Counter-Chemical, Biological,
     Radiological, and Nuclear Operations, and AFMAN 10-2602 (until rescinded by AFMAN 10-2502
     Series publications) for more information on CBRN passive defensive measures.

Table 3.7. Typical Installation CBRN Passive Defensive Measures.
                     CBRN Passive Defensive Measures and Specific Actions
          Review threat levels, warning signals, and alarm conditions:
          Provide visual aids and current information to each unit control centers, the base
          population, and all assigned, attached, coalition, and host-nation forces.
          Develop multilingual visual aids and public address systems announcements.
          Include warning procedures for geographically separated units, non-combatants,
          and enemy prisoners of war.
          Verify the operation and coverage of the installation warning system:
          Verify the actual times required to notify the air base population under each
          warning method (base siren, public address system, radio net, and telephone).
          Verify the warning system is able to provide warning and notification to 100
          percent of the air base population within 10 minutes.
          Implement the air base zones or sector plan to support the movement of
          contaminated assets (people and equipment) between zones or sectors:
          Identify critical attack recovery teams (explosive ordinance disposal (EOD),
          airfield and building damage assessment, CBRN reconnaissance, and firefighter)
          and sector or zone crossing procedures to facilitate quick movement in support of
          recovery operations.
          UCCs must ensure that personnel moving from contaminated zones or sectors to
          uncontaminated zones or sectors do not inadvertently reduce MOPP when
          split-MOPP operations are executed.
          Review the status of planned and in-progress medical pretreatments.
          Develop and implement an air base Ground Sector and CBRN zone plan:
          Practice likely attack recovery scenarios with command and control elements.
          Ensure unit control centers understand their responsibility to maintain control of
          their personnel when they enter or exit contaminated areas.
          Provide zone or sector information or maps to each unit control center and all
          assigned, attached, coalition, and host-nation command and control centers.
          If the previous alarm condition was Alarm Red or Black, re-evaluate the
          status of protective actions:

                       CBRN Passive Defensive Measures and Specific Actions
            Replenish material expended during contamination control or decontamination
            operations.
            Redistribute material, such as IPE and nerve agent antidotes, to support priority
            missions or units with high usage rates.
            Take action to replace casualties.
            Review previously reported damage. Verify damage, contamination, and UXO
            reports were received and action is complete or under way to resolve the situation.
            Initiate action to collect and dispose of contaminated waste, unclaimed weapons
            and ammunition, and UXO that is declared safe for movement to holding areas.
            Prepare a written record that identifies the location of previously contaminated
            areas, unrecovered human remains, contaminated waste burial sites, missile and
            bomb craters, and unrecovered UXO.
            Review the probable CBRN attack threat scenarios and actions with Security
            Forces, CE Readiness and Emergency Management, and intelligence
            personnel at each shift change.
            Activate CBRN specialized teams:
            Assign personnel where needed to bring teams up to 100 percent of required
            manning for 24-hour operations.
            Direct responsible units to verify team material is serviceable and operators are
            proficient.
            Conduct team drills and training to meet local proficiency standards.
            Maintain watch for clandestine attack indications
            Periodically remind personnel to remain observant for signs of a clandestine or
            suspicious activity. Provide specific information on threats, if available.
            Increase protection for food and water supplies.
            Direct units to store a 24-hour supply of Meals, Ready to Eat (MREs) in their unit
            area. If attacks have occurred, consider the need to use uncontaminated MREs or
            packaged foods and bottled water until food service supplies are checked for
            contamination.
            Develop or implement the air base CCA plan:
            Identify primary and alternate CCA on-base locations.
            CCA must be able to process the required percentage of the air base population
            over a 24-hour period.

3.8. Base Evacuation. Evacuation of personnel and key resources is often accomplished to prevent
injury and minimize damage and destruction. Limited area evacuations are usually conducted for reasons
such as accidents, criminal activity, terrorist attacks, and other localized incidents. However, base evacu-
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               59


ations are large-scale relocations typically implemented for natural disasters and non-combatant evacua-
tion operations (NEO) prior to an enemy attack. Since specific CE execution tasks for base evacuations
are different for each installation, mission, situation, and location, follow instructions in the base CEMP
10-2 and CE CRP. In addition to coordinating on-base evacuation plans, general CE preparations for base
evacuations include the following:
   3.8.1. Natural Disasters. Develop unit procedures to disseminate and execute base evacuation
   orders and information. Also develop unit evacuation plans to include vehicle load plans.
   3.8.2. Non-Combatant Evacuation (NEO) Prior to Enemy Attack. Develop facility use and site
   plans to beddown incoming non-combatant evacuees.

                                                  Chapter 4

                                    COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS

4.1. Introduction. Managing and controlling information effectively are paramount in any coordinated
activity—this is especially true during military and disaster response operations. Command and control
centers are virtually worthless without good communications. A key part of civil engineer preparations
for disaster and attack includes working with the communications squadron to ensure key communication
nodes are in place and operational. These nodes include: primary and secondary installation warning sys-
tems (e.g., Giant Voice and Telephone Alerting Systems); primary and secondary crash networks; and
communications nodes for the primary and alternate Installation Control Center (ICC), Emergency Oper-
ations Center (EOC), CE Damage Control Center (DCC), Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC), Fire
Alarm Communications Center (FACC), and the Emergency Communications Center (consolidated dis-
patch) when implemented. Civil engineers also accomplish other command and control preparations such
as setting up the DCC and EOC facilities and establishing manual procedures for collecting information
on damage to facilities, utilities, and pavements when disruptions in installation communications and
computer systems occur.

4.2. Communications Systems. Communications systems are a primary means of command and con-
trol. They are used in every aspect of C2, including planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling
forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission. Although the discussion in this section
focuses on communications systems that are used in the EOC and DCC, several of the communications
methods addressed here could apply to any unit control center (UCC).
     4.2.1. Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The EOC is the C2 support element that directs,
     monitors, and supports the installation’s actions before, during, and after an incident, attack, or disas-
     ter. The EOC updates the ICC with ongoing incident status and seeks support through the ICC when
     on-scene requirements surpass the installation’s inherent capability. Each method of communication
     listed below fulfills a unique requirement, and each has its own limitations. There is no specific stan-
     dard, but a well-equipped EOC will have the following:
        4.2.1.1. Telephones. Preferably one multi-line unit is provided at each work station. Prepare a list
        with phone numbers of key personnel and frequently called organizations. Include counterparts
        for joint operations and local communities (i.e., local EOC). Remember that non-secure tele-
        phones can be monitored, and lines can be easily cut.
        4.2.1.2. Intra-Base Radios. Radios should be capable of communicating on all frequencies asso-
        ciated with disaster and wartime response. These frequencies include emergency management,
        FES, EOD, CE, security forces, vehicle operations/dispatch, etc. Equip the radios with speakers
        and headsets. The headsets help reduce the noise level in the EOC while the speakers permit
        everyone to listen when required. Older radio systems may have only one frequency. Those radios
        are easily jammed and monitored. When a lot of personnel need to use one frequency, your own
        personnel tend to jam each other. These problems can be reduced by using the secure, multi-fre-
        quency Scope Shield II radios.
        4.2.1.3. Tactical Radios. These radios are required to communicate with the mobile emergency
        operations center.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               61


       4.2.1.4. Hot Lines. These provide a direct line to the ICC and UCC. Hot lines are useful between
       functional representatives in the EOC and their UCCs. While a little slower and subject to busy
       signals, telephones can do this job.
       4.2.1.5. Installation Public Address System. Access to a public address system, such as Giant
       Voice, gives the EOC a method to pass time-sensitive threat warning conditions to the base popu-
       lation, but it is one-way communication only.
       4.2.1.6. FAX Capability. FAX machines are an increasingly useful method of quickly transmit-
       ting information. While one machine in a control center is sufficient, identify a backup machine or
       one that can be relocated to the EOC.
       4.2.1.7. Cellular Phones. These phones significantly expand the communication options in the
       US. This area continues to improve, both in the US and overseas. They are especially useful in
       disaster situations.
       4.2.1.8. Field Telephones. When nothing else is available, field phones can be a blessing. How-
       ever, you must run wires between the phones, and that takes time. You will also need to protect the
       wires from accidental breaks especially near vehicle traffic routes. Not many installations have
       these phones on-hand, because other communication methods are convenient and readily avail-
       able.
       4.2.1.9. Computers. Computers facilitate the quick transfer of data and other information
       between the EOC, ICC, and unit control centers, significantly reducing the time and errors
       involved versus passing information by telephone or radio. Computers typically replace visible
       status charts, store additional status and damage assessment information, and eliminate the need
       for paper copies of damage assessment reports. Computers should be pre-loaded with installation
       maps, status charts, plans, checklists, etc. Maps can be loaded so the user can zoom into any loca-
       tion for additional detail, which is especially useful with accurately mapped utility systems. The
       Guardian Installation Protection Program is introducing linked computers which connect the IC to
       the EOC wirelessly, allowing digital photos and other real-time data from the scene to be provided
       to the EOC. However, wireless communications and some other uses can present firewall prob-
       lems which must be worked out in advance with your local communications squadron.
          4.2.1.9.1. Four conditions should be satisfied before you rely on computers in or between con-
          trol centers: each key person in any control center should have easy access to a computer, the
          computers should be networked so the status information can be shared, the server should be
          protected from damage, and the computers must have secure power. You cannot afford to lose
          the information or lose access to it.
          4.2.1.9.2. Be sure to safeguard classified checklists, plans, and other materials stored in indi-
          vidual computers or transferred over a network.
   4.2.2. CE Damage Control Center (DCC). Normally manned by CE specialists from infrastructure
   support, heavy repair, facility maintenance, and other engineering fields, the DCC controls and com-
   municates CE response activities, coordinates those activities with other base organizations, and
   arranges support from others as needed. Communications equipment within the DCC facility nor-
   mally includes telephones, hot lines, radios, and other communication devices.

4.3. Installation Notification and Warning System (INWS). The INWS is a combination of methods
using audible and visual signals, verbal messages, and electronic communication. Communication modes
62                                                                      AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


include sirens, horns, radio tone alerting, mass notification systems, unaided voice systems, public and
broadcast address systems, local area network messaging, telephone alert conferencing, pagers, televi-
sion, radio, flags, signs, and other electronic or mechanical methods. The design of these warning systems
is usually a collaboration between CE and communications squadrons, and the systems are required to be
redundant, hardened, or splinter-protected and operate using both commercial and emergency power.
Existing networks should also be incorporated into this system. Other features of the INWS are listed in
Table 4.1.

Table 4.1. INWS Features.
                             Installation Notification and Warning System
Provide installation-wide coverage of outdoor areas, indoor facilities, housing, and separated sites.
Reach off-base facilities that are controlled or owned by the installation to ensure coverage for personnel
working or billeted in those areas.
Incorporate DOD-required Mass Notification System (MNS) into the indoor coverage.
Incorporate systematic and coordinated standard to support the Air Force Incident Management System
(AFIMS).
Provide mechanisms for vertical and horizontal coordination, communications, and information sharing
in response to threats or incidents.

     4.3.1. Mass Notification System (MNS). Implementation of an effective mass notification system
     requires the coordinated efforts of engineering, communications, and security personnel. Coordina-
     tion with communications personnel is needed because every mass notification system will require the
     use of base communication systems. Each installation should prepare an implementation plan that
     establishes a comprehensive approach to mass notification that is acceptable to security, communica-
     tions, and engineering personnel. Elements of an implementation plan include a needs assessment,
     requirements definition, alternatives evaluation, system selection, and implementation schedule. Mass
     notification systems include individual building systems, giant voice system, and telephone alerting
     system.
        4.3.1.1. Individual Building Systems. These systems consist of the Autonomous Control Unit
        and Notification Appliance Network.
            4.3.1.1.1. Autonomous Control Unit. The autonomous control unit is used to monitor and
            control the notification appliance network and provide consoles for local operation. Using a
            console, personnel can initiate, in a building, the delivery of pre-recorded voice messages, pro-
            vide live voice messages and instructions, and initiate visual strobe and (optional) textual mes-
            sage notification. The autonomous control unit will temporarily deactivate audible fire alarm
            appliances while delivering voice messages to ensure the messages are intelligible. If an instal-
            lation-wide control system for mass notification is provided on the installation, the autono-
            mous control unit also communicates with the central control unit of the installation-wide
            system to provide status information and receive commands and messages.
            4.3.1.1.2. Notification Appliance Network. The notification appliance network consists of
            audio speakers located to provide intelligible instructions in and around the building. Strobes
            may also be provided to alert hearing-impaired occupants.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                63


       4.3.1.2. Giant Voice System. The Giant Voice System (Figure 4.1.), also known as Big Voice, is
       typically installed as an installation-wide system to provide a siren signal and pre-recorded and
       live voice messages. It is most useful for providing mass notification for personnel in outdoor
       areas, expeditionary structures, and temporary buildings. It is generally not suitable for mass noti-
       fication to personnel in permanent structures because the voice messages are generally unintelligi-
       ble. If an installation-wide control system for mass notification is provided on the installation, an
       interface to the Giant Voice system may improve the functionality of both systems.

Figure 4.1. Engineers Install Giant Voice System at Deployed Location.




       4.3.1.3. Telephone Alerting System. Telephone alerting systems are independent systems that
       may be used to provide mass notification to buildings and facilities. These systems are useful for
       buildings in which notification to all building occupants may not be appropriate (e.g., child devel-
       opment centers, hospital patient areas, brigs). They also might be appropriate for small facilities
       and military family housing where mass notification is not required by UFC 4-010-01. Use of tele-
       phone alerting systems, however, should be considered carefully before installing in most build-
       ings and facilities requiring mass notification because there are many limitations in delivering
       notification messages by telephone.
   4.3.2. INWS Summary. Every Air Force installation is required to have a rapid and effective system
   to disseminate emergency information quickly, but every installation does not have an installation
   notification and warning system with all the elements and methods described in this section. Never-
   theless, any system, procedures, or combination thereof that provides required mass notification capa-
   bility may be acceptable. Refer to AFI 10-2501 and UFC 4-021-01 for details on notification and
   warning standards.

4.4. Other Command and Control Preparations. In addition to helping with EOC communications
and the installation’s mass notification and warning system, civil engineers have the added tasks of setting
up and managing the installation primary EOC, mobile emergency operations center (MEOC), and CE
unit control center and completing other C2 preparations. These other command and control preparations
64                                                                       AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


involve setting up facilities, organizing control center teams; putting communications equipment and pro-
cedures in place; publishing base alert conditions and alarm signals; establishing control center operating
procedures; developing unit procedures for recall, authentication codes, and passwords; and making pro-
visions for continuity of operations. The composition of the EOC and the functional relationships with the
installation control center and unit control centers are addressed in AFI 10-2501.
     4.4.1. EOC Facility. Ideally the EOC should be located adjacent to or collocated with the installation
     control center; however, some EOCs are located in separate facilities and still operate effectively. In a
     high-threat area, the EOC should be semi-hardened or at least splinter protected to improve its surviv-
     ability. Be sure to provide backup electrical power or a connection for quick hookup of an emergency
     generator. On the inside, arrange work stations so emergency support function (ESF) personnel have
     easy access to view maps, situation status information, and the Common Operating Picture and can
     communicate easily with each other and the EOC director (Figure 4.2.).

Figure 4.2. Typical ESF Work Station Arrangement.




        4.4.1.1. Maps. Typical maps that should be provided are listed in Table 4.2. The airfield pave-
        ments map is most often used in wartime to plot damage and repairs to the airfield pavements.

        4.4.1.2. Incident Status Displays. In addition to maps, readily visible status displays (usually
        electronic or status boards) help the EOC staff keep track of the condition of the installation, unit
        status, and the recovery efforts. Suggested incident status displays include those listed in Table
        4.3.

   4.4.2. CE Damage Control Center. The best place for the CE Damage Control Center (DCC) is
   within walking distance of the CE shops. This makes communications easier when phones or radios
   are not available. Install a backup power source. As with the EOC, appropriate maps of the facility and
   airfield should be readily available for coordinating and plotting response activities (Figure 4.3.). See
   AFPAM 10-219, Volume 1, for staffing recommendations.

Figure 4.3. Civil Engineer DCC Facility.




       4.4.2.1. OPLANs and Support Plans. Keep at least one copy in the DCC of every operations
       plan (OPLAN), support plan, or base plan that CE supports. There should be multiple copies of the
       CE Contingency Response Plan. Table 4.4. lists three examples of plans that should be maintained
       in the DCC when needed.

            Plan Type                                              Purpose
Comprehensive Emergency               Provides comprehensive guidance for emergency response to
Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2           physical threats resulting from major accidents, natural disasters,
                                      conventional attacks, terrorist attacks, and CBRN attacks.
CE Contingency Response Plan          This plan is the civil engineer's detailed guide for using and
(CRP) with all annexes and            controlling the engineer forces in a disaster or contingency at an
checklists.                           installation. This plan should provide CE-specific guidance for
                                      supporting implementation of CEMP 10-2 and other base-level
                                      plans.
HAZMAT Emergency Planning             Outlines how the base responds to a spill of hazardous materials
and Response Plan                     other than nuclear and explosives. Base Civil Engineer is
                                      responsible for the HAZMAT Plan; however, it requires the active
                                      support of many base organizations.

      4.4.2.2. Maps. Nothing is as useful as a good map to help maintain a “picture” of the crisis and
      your response. Place maps in frames and cover with Plexiglas so the maps can be easily marked up
      and cleaned off. Light the maps, but do it so glare is not a problem. Use these maps:
          4.4.2.2.1. On-base crash grid map (1:4800 scale - 1” = 400′)
          4.4.2.2.2. Off-base crash grid map.
          4.4.2.2.3. Airfield pavements or takeoff and landing (TOL) surfaces map (1:1200 scale - 1” =
          100′) with runway/taxiway station marking systems annotated.
          4.4.2.2.4. Master plan tabs (G-tabs) - utility systems. The suggested scale is 1” = 400′. If nec-
          essary at big bases, use 1” = 600′ or 1” = 800′. (If they exist, keep a set of the smaller scale
          (1:1200 - 1” = 100′ or 1:600 - 1” = 50′) tabs for each utility. These are usually too large to
          mount on the wall.)
          4.4.2.2.5. Use geospatial site-mapping information, services, and overlays, when available.
      4.4.2.3. Status Charts. Maintain visible status charts (Table 4.5.) to help control the CE
      responses to a crisis. Display these charts and any others that you may find helpful. Attachment 2
      contains some ideas for status chart formats.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              67

Special purpose equipment status.                   Priority facility damage/recovery status.
Critical supplies and spares status.                Critical infrastructure status.

       4.4.2.4. Communications. Provide good communications equipment for the DCC staff. As with
       the EOC, install telephones, intra-base radios, and FAX capability. Use cellular phones when pos-
       sible, and consider field telephones. Radios in the DCC should be equipped with both speakers
       and headsets. The DCC should be connected with the functions, units, and teams listed in Table
       4.6. Try to establish two independent methods. Practical connections are offered, but any method
       you choose is okay.
           4.4.2.4.1. Call Signs. Set up call signs for CE shops or teams. At home station, use codes you
           normally use in peacetime. This reduces confusion. At deployment locations, find out the local
           CE frequencies and call signs. When starting from scratch, consider functional call signs, such
           as Electrical-1, 2, 3; Structures-1, 2, 3; Pavements-1, 2, 3, or with humorous but descriptive
           names such as Sparky-1, 2, 3; Hammer-1, 2, 3; Dirtboy-1, 2, 3.
           4.4.2.4.2. Unit Recall. Develop procedures to recall members of the CE unit to duty stations
           during non-duty periods. The most common method is the telephone pyramid recall, but run-
           ners can be used. Keep recall and assembly instructions simple, and train unit personnel in
           advance on where to report and with what. Have procedures to recall the entire unit and just
           the military. Review those procedures for possible adjustment when a Prime BEEF team
           deploys. When normal telephone communications are not available, preplanned and tested
           alternate procedures must be ready for use.

        4.4.2.5. Other Items to Have On Hand. There are a number of other items which are useful to
        have on hand in the DCC. Some of them are:
            4.4.2.5.1. AFPAM 10-219 series publications.
            4.4.2.5.2. AFH 10-222 series handbooks.
            4.4.2.5.3. MOS (minimum operating strip) selection templates (at bases subject to an enemy
            attack).
            4.4.2.5.4. T.O. 35E2-4-1, Repair Quality Criteria System for Rapid Runway Repair (at bases
            subject to an enemy attack).
            4.4.2.5.5. Local area telephone directory with yellow pages.
        4.4.2.6. Computers. Computers can also be put to good use in the DCC. The thoughts on using
        computers in the EOC also apply to the DCC.
     4.4.3. Alternate Communications Procedures. Plan and practice Comm-out/radio silence proce-
     dures. In a crisis, count on losing communications with someone or some organization. Also, there
     may be situations where you want to impose radio silence. In either case, develop alternate methods to
     pass information. If you lose a base station, a vehicle with a radio can be positioned nearby or just the
     radio with a battery can be used. Most likely you must use other radios in between your destination to
     relay the messages. Runners are also effective, but slower.
        4.4.3.1. Arrange for runners. Runners are a reliable way to pass lengthy, detailed data, but they are
        also the slowest form of communication. While not an absolute rule, it is a good idea to identify
        these personnel in advance. Show runners where they must go and how to get there, because some
        will have a poor knowledge of the installation and a poor sense of direction.
        4.4.3.2. Arrange for visual signals such as flags and flares. These methods can quickly send sim-
        ple alert signals to personnel within visual range when radios are not available.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                         69


       4.4.3.3. Map the radio dead spots on and around the installation. Check with the operations per-
       sonnel in base communications. They may already have this information. Mark this information
       on control center maps.
   4.4.4. Continuity of Operations. Provide for continuity of command and control. Organize the sec-
   ond shift for the control center. Set up an alternate control center during wartime operations. There are
   many ways to do this. Two such possibilities are:
       4.4.4.1. Do nothing until the control center is damaged. Then consolidate or collocate the lost
       control center function with another control center where communication equipment is available.
       (The off-duty shift would be recalled to pick up control, and another relief shift would be formed.)
       Crowding would be a major issue.
       4.4.4.2. Set up a separate facility with minimum equipment before the first enemy attack. This
       facility can be unmanned until activated by the off-duty shift. To speed resumption of control, con-
       sider staffing the facility with a minimum crew who keep a duplicate set of status charts. This
       requires a good communications link with the primary control center and procedures to keep the
       alternate facility staff informed. Telephones are important. Radios are essential. A FAX capability
       and computer link would be helpful.
   4.4.5. Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs). An FPCON is a security posture declared by the
   commander in consideration of a variety of threat factors (Table 4.7.). US facilities, because of their
   symbolic value or relative isolation, can be attractive terrorist targets. This is also true for military and
   civilian personnel because of their grade, assignment, or symbolic value. Based on available informa-
   tion about local terrorist activity, installation commanders determine whether or not there is a terrorist
   threat to installation facilities or personnel, and, if so, select and declare the appropriate FPCON. AFI
   10-245 describes force protection conditions and measures.

Table 4.7. Force Protection Conditions (FPCONs).

                 action against a specific location or person is
                 imminent.
     4.4.6. Emergency Notification and Alarm Signals. Emergency notification and alarm signals warn
     base personnel and units of an attack or impending disaster. The more advance warning given, the
     greater the probability that advance actions can reduce damage and injury. Everyone on base should
     know the meaning of each signal. Signals may be passed by sirens, horns, flags, telephone, intra-base
     and tactical radios, stationary and mobile public address systems, whistles, person-to-person, televi-
     sion, radio, etc. The methods used depend on the nature and immediacy of the crisis, location of per-
     sonnel to be notified, and alerting systems available. Signals may be repeated as often as necessary to
     make sure that the entire base population responds. The Air Force has standard emergency notifica-
     tion and alarm signals which are described in two visual aids: AFVA 10-2510, U.S. Air Force Emer-
     gency Notification Signals, and AFVA 10-2511, USAF Standardized Attack Warning Signals for
     NBCC Medium and High Threat Areas, as shown in AFMAN 10-2602 (until rescinded by AFMAN
     10-2502 Series publications). Additional signals may be used to meet the peculiar needs of any com-
     mand or installation. Installations in overseas areas use the signals prescribed by the unified theater
     commander.

4.5. Summary. Sound command and control preparations facilitate coordination, communications, and
cooperation between agencies and personnel during an emergency. They also improve base response,
recovery, and mission sustainment. For more specific information on CE preparations related to com-
mand, control, and communications, review the references listed in Table 4.8.

                   ISOLATION, BACKUP, AND PROTECTION OF UTILITIES

5.1. Introduction. The loss of utility service has immediate impacts on the operations of an air base.
Some losses cause only annoyance or inconvenience, but others quickly degrade mission performance.
The significance of those impacts varies with the utility that has been disrupted, the nature and extent of
the disruption, and the importance of the affected activities to the mission. As “owner” of the base utility
systems, civil engineers can minimize utility service disruption and resulting mission impacts with good
disaster attack planning and preparations. As a minimum, civil engineers should ensure that procedures
and resources are in place to isolate all or portions of the base utility systems, provide utility backup to
mission-critical activities, and protect key components of the utility systems from damage. For situations
when only limited utility service can be provided, the base must also develop demand reduction proce-
dures. Protecting important base utility services is not a CE-only responsibility. Many preparations
require installation-wide inputs and preplanned responses. This chapter presents recommendations for
developing system isolation; emergency backup; and physical protection measures in each of seven utility
systems: electrical, water, heating, gas, liquid fuels, sanitary sewage, and airfield lighting. The importance
of installation-wide demand reduction procedures is also highlighted.

5.2. Learning the Systems. The first step in disaster or attack preparation of a utility system is to learn
all you can about that system: its sources, configuration, vulnerabilities, operating details, recurring prob-
lems, spare parts, and other basic utility data. If possible, use Expeditionary Site Mapping to aid in iden-
tifying and locating critical equipment or resources. When searching for utility information, a good data
source is the Base Comprehensive Plan. This plan is a combination of component plans, studies, and maps
that document a wide range of information that is essential to decision-makers when planning and manag-
ing an installation’s physical assets in support of the mission. The Infrastructure Component Plan and tabs
E and G are part of the Base Comprehensive Plan and are good sources of information for successful plan-
ning of isolation procedures and other utility system preparations. Attachment 4 is a comprehensive plan
map that lists the titles of all associated tabs.
   5.2.1. Basic Utility Data. This paragraph outlines, in general terms, the information you should col-
   lect for all utility systems on your installation. You can find suggestions for utility-specific informa-
   tion in paragraph 5.5. through 5.11. Include systems information in the utilities annex (N) of your CE
   Contingency Response Plan. For most installations, data collection is an easy task because informa-
   tion should already be available. Good shop foremen have this information on hand, because they use
   it in their day-to-day activities. Civil engineers need to gather this information and put it in one place,
   because “the person with the needed information” may not always be available.
       5.2.1.1. Source/Treatment Facility. Describe the sources/treatment facilities for each base util-
       ity. Identify the location and capacity of each source. Explain any operating restrictions. If fur-
       nished from off base, show the point(s) of receipt or discharge and include the point of contact,
       normal and emergency telephone numbers, and address.
       5.2.1.2. On-Base Production and Storage. If the commodity is consumed and the base has the
       capability to produce it, state daily production capacity both in total quantity and as a percentage
       of average daily base consumption. If the commodity is stored, state the base's storage capacity
       both in total units and as a percentage of average daily consumption.

        5.2.1.3. Layout and Configuration of Distribution System. Describe key system components
        such as pumps, transformers, and lift stations. Identify items which are interchangeable. Explain
        the layout of the distribution systems and the normal configuration of valves or switches.
        5.2.1.4. Operation of the System. If not apparent by the preceding information, describe how
        the system operates. Explain adjustments needed for pre-identified special situations.
        5.2.1.5. Consumption or Discharge. Record maximum, minimum, and average daily consump-
        tion (or discharge), and show daily variation in demand. This is easily done using graphs such as
        shown in Figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1. Typical Demand (or Discharge).




        5.2.1.6. Recurring Problems. Every utility system will occasionally have problems, but some
        systems experience recurring problems with regularity. Identify and document such problems so
        your base can prepare for them and minimize their impacts.
        5.2.1.7. Backup Capabilities. Describe alternate methods which the base, not just CE, can
        employ to deliver full or limited utility service to users.
        5.2.1.8. Hazards. Briefly describe any hazards to personnel that would result from damage to the
        distribution, production, or storage facilities associated with a utility system.
     5.2.2. Repair Considerations. While collecting basic system information, it also makes sense to
     gather information on repair capabilities such as type, location, and quantity of repair materials and
     replacement items. Address the issue of what spares should be maintained for critical components and
     identify which components within the system (transformers, circuit breakers, and switches) are inter-
     changeable. Spare equipment lists should be checked against system requirements and a record made
     of the condition and location of all spares. This same information is needed for generating plants and
     mobile generators. An annual review is particularly critical for those items stored as special levels.

5.3. Assessing Vulnerabilities. To determine what preparations deserve priority attention, identify
which utility system components are most at risk from the likely threats. Obviously underground elements
of utility systems are inherently more survivable. CE shop personnel possess the knowledge and experi-
ence to assess system vulnerabilities and to develop additional protective measures. To perform an assess-
ment, try the red team-blue team approach. Divide personnel responsible for operating and maintaining a
particular utility into two groups. One group plays the role of aggressor, saboteur, terrorist, natural disas-
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                     73


ter, or accident. The other group develops countermeasures and repairs to defeat or minimize the mea-
sures proposed by the former. Have the two groups switch roles during follow-on sessions. Since the
utility systems serving an installation are usually complex, time is well spent in this iterative gaming pro-
cess. In addition to identifying vulnerable system components, a well conducted exercise can develop fea-
sible options for system isolation, backup, additional hardening, as well as spares pre-positioning and
repair procedures. Include the results of the assessment in the utilities annex (N) to your CE Contingency
Response Plan. Request help from your security forces. They can identify specific enemy ground threats
and avenues of attack.

5.4. Determining Critical Requirements. You need another step to complete the data gathering and
assessment phase of disaster and attack preparations. You must determine hard core utility require-
ments—for individual users and the base. CE leads this effort, but all installation units and the installation
leadership should be players. Three tasks are required: identify the critical users, determine the minimum
requirements for each critical user, and calculate the minimum critical base-wide requirement.
   5.4.1. What is a critical utility requirement? Each installation has different answers to that question. If
   you need a description, try this one: if the loss of utility service to a facility prevents aircraft from fly-
   ing or being repaired, degrades command and control of the installation's forces, or jeopardizes life-
   saving activities such as hospital operating rooms or CBRN shelters—that function/facility has a
   critical requirement. Loss of service that causes only inconvenience is not a mission-critical impact.
   Neither is a loss that forces work-arounds that are easily performed; for example, going next door for
   drinking water or to use the latrine. Air conditioning in quarters or in a dorm is very nice, but it is a
   convenience. However, air conditioning for temperature-sensitive air traffic control or communica-
   tions equipment is probably critical.
   5.4.2. An installation can sort critical from non-critical utility requirements in at least two ways or can
   use a combination of the two.
       5.4.2.1. Start with the facility priority list. If it accurately reflects mission priorities, you can use
       that list to identify facilities which contribute most to mission priorities. Either measure consump-
       tion or have the occupants provide requirements for each building. Taking those inputs at face
       value, calculate the total critical requirements for the installation. This approach involves the least
       time and fewest number of personnel, but it may overstate requirements since the user inputs are
       not challenged.
       5.4.2.2. A second way is more precise but also more time-consuming. Have installation units
       identify their mission-critical facilities, list specific utility requirements for each room which con-
       tains a critical function, and state what function is to be performed. For example, “We need 120/
       208V, 50 amps of power plus room lighting and air conditioning in room 12 of building 1142, so
       we can calibrate the F-15 internal navigation system with our test stand.” Units should also defend
       their requirements in terms of mission impact. They should specify what work-around solutions
       they must implement if they lose a utility. They should state the impact of working in that alterna-
       tive situation by explaining how the flying mission will be affected and how long it will take
       before loss of service starts to critically affect the mission. This need not be a quantitative defense
       as much as a common sense one. To help units do this, civil engineers should make facility draw-
       ings available so the units can annotate their needs on the drawings. CE should evaluate and chal-
       lenge potentially unreasonable or excessive requirements. Negotiate questionable requirements
       with the users. If you still have problems with their inputs, develop alternatives. Present the user
74                                                                       AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


        requirements and your alternatives to the installation leadership for approval. Then consolidate all
        critical requirements for the installation.
     5.4.3. Sorting critical from non-critical requirements can be challenging, because no unit thinks of
     themselves as “non-critical.” Almost every unit can show how they directly support the mission and
     therefore are critical, but it is unrealistic to treat every unit—or even every section in the key units—
     as mission critical. This is where the installation leadership is essential. They can better see the “big
     picture” and can decide what activities really are mission critical. Civil engineers can then work with
     the units to refine the detailed requirements and total the installation's critical requirements. If you
     have the storage space in CE, keep a copy of every unit's requirements and marked up facility draw-
     ings. This makes it easier to periodically validate and update requirements.

5.5. Electrical System Preparations. The installation electrical system is one of the most complex util-
ity systems serving an installation, and its loss has an immediate impact on the installation mission. This
discussion of the electrical system covers four areas: system information to collect and document in the
CE Contingency Response Plan, system isolation preparations, emergency backup preparations, and
physical protective measures.
     5.5.1. System Information. Good data collection must precede disaster and attack preparations. This
     paragraph provides guidance on specific data to obtain about the installation electrical system. This is
     the minimum information needed. Collect and document any additional information you need to ade-
     quately describe your system. Tab G-4 of the Base Comprehensive Plan generally contains much of
     the basic data for on-base systems. The infrastructure support element chief should ensure that system
     information is maintained in at least two separate locations. This includes schematics of substation
     equipment and layout, name plate data, technical orders, manufacturer’s literature on equipment,
     switch configurations, and other pertinent information.
        5.5.1.1. Government-Owned Substation. With an off-base source, begin at the point of
        receipt—the main substation/switch station. Give a general description that includes the location,
        number and size of supply feeders, voltages, and transformer capacities; state whether or not the
        capacity is limited by the conductors, transformers, or other feature. If there is more than one
        source, provide this same information for each receiving point.
        5.5.1.2. Non-Government Substation. At many installations, the substation, although physi-
        cally located on base, belongs to the supplier. Gather the same basic information on substation/
        switch station capabilities as outlined for a government-owned substation. No matter whether the
        power supplier is a commercial source, public utility, or national power corporation, it is important
        to know the point of contact and record that information in the CE Contingency Response Plan.
        5.5.1.3. Generating Plants. Fixed generating plants (Figure 5.2.), to include mobile, continuous
        duty plants of 100 kW or greater capacity, should be inventoried and basic data recorded. As a
        minimum, include the following data:
            5.5.1.3.1. Location.
            5.5.1.3.2. Total rated plant capacity (in kW).
            5.5.1.3.3. Firm plant capacity (in kW).
            5.5.1.3.4. Capacity of each generator (in kW).
            5.5.1.3.5. Make and model.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               75


          5.5.1.3.6. Type fuel required and amount stored on site (gallons).
          5.5.1.3.7. Daily fuel consumption (in gallons) during continuous use and the time interval (in
          days or hours) before resupply is required.
      5.5.1.4. Distribution System. Record the location, capacity, and type of cable, transformers,
      switch gear, etc., for each of the primary feeders and secondary (less than 600V) circuits. Identify
      the normal position of switches. Explain backfeed capabilities. Be sure to mark line voltages on
      the drawings. While not common, some installations have two or more separate primary distribu-
      tion voltages. This can minimize back feed capabilities.

Figure 5.2. Power Plant Generator.




      5.5.1.5. Backup/Emergency Generators. Generator units are accounted for as either Real Prop-
      erty Installed Equipment (RPIE), Equipment Authorization Inventory Data (EAID), or War
      Reserve Materiel (WRM). To maximize your capability and flexibility to provide electrical power
      during a contingency, keep a current inventory of all RPIE, EAID, and WRM units. Record, as a
      minimum, the following data for each generator:
          5.5.1.5.1. Type of generator and capacity (in kW).
          5.5.1.5.2. Run time when fully fueled (24 hours, 7 days, 14 days).
          5.5.1.5.3. Location.
          5.5.1.5.4. Facility and activity for which authorized.
          5.5.1.5.5. Type of fuel and quantity available on site.
          5.5.1.5.6. Whether it is part of an uninterruptible power system (UPS), has an auto start capa-
          bility, or is manually controlled.
          5.5.1.5.7. Connection details (plug, split-bolt, etc.) and load transfer method at the facility
          where the unit is likely to be used.
      5.5.1.6. Vulnerability Assessment. As important as the electrical system is to the installation
      mission, it can be quite vulnerable, especially an older system. Aboveground components, such as
      transformer stations, substations, overhead circuits, and off-base transmission lines, are especially
      vulnerable. Identify any elements or portions of the system which have recurring problems. These
76                                                                        AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


        locations have a greater chance for causing problems. Some installations have prime power gener-
        ating plants collocated with the main substation which receives power from an off-base source.
        This arrangement makes an attractive and vulnerable target.
        5.5.1.7. Critical Facility Requirements. Make a list of critical facilities and activities. Plot the
        location of these critical facilities on the tab G-4 layout of the Base Comprehensive Plan. Use this
        layout to preplan emergency switching and isolation procedures. Identify the specific power
        requirements for each key facility: voltage, load, frequency, quality of power for special equip-
        ment, etc. Remember, it is unlikely that all requirements within a facility are critical.
     5.5.2. System Isolation and Emergency Switching. There are many reasons to isolate portions of
     the electrical system or to reroute power. An installation needs capabilities to rapidly isolate damage
     to the system and restore power to intact facilities in the area of the damage; create alternate paths to
     backfeed critical loads; and shut off power to all or portions of the system to protect it, personnel, and
     installation facilities from damage.
        5.5.2.1. Utility system isolation is not an uncommon CE activity. Given warning prior to an attack
        or disaster, preparations and procedures can often be completed to protect system components and
        to sustain service to critical activities. Some activities must have power during or immediately
        after the active phase of an attack or natural disaster. An installation should consider the following
        actions:
            5.5.2.1.1. Transferring essential loads to emergency/backup generators prior to the onset of
            the hazardous phase.
            5.5.2.1.2. Sectionalizing the system (to the maximum extent possible) prior to the impending
            threat.
            5.5.2.1.3. Shutting power OFF to minimize damage during the active phase of an attack or
            disaster. Generally this action is useful only where you have overhead distribution lines.
            Besides protecting personnel, this action protects system components from damage due to
            uncontrolled phase-to-phase or phase-to-ground shorts. One problem with cutting off power is
            that personnel cannot use their televisions or radios to get emergency instructions. Whether to
            shut off power and where to do it is an installation leadership decision. Civil engineers should
            offer recommendations.
        5.5.2.2. Civil engineers should develop isolation procedures that specify which circuits to isolate,
        where to do it, and in what sequence. Always stress safe electrical practices when opening and
        closing switches and breakers, even in war—this protects system components and technicians.
        Document isolation and switching procedures in operating instructions (OI) and include those OIs
        in the CE Contingency Response Plan. Prepare supporting/execution checklists for shops and
        DCC. OIs and checklists should outline the sequence of actions and identify individual and coor-
        dinated tasks. If conditions permit, give users a warning that power is to be cut off. This gives
        them time to implement backup procedures.
        5.5.2.3. To facilitate communications between repair crews and the DCC, it is helpful to use a
        code to identify primary feeders and their associated loops. One technique is to use a combination
        of colors, letters, and numbers to identify system parts. For example, given an installation that has
        three primary feeders with several loops on each feeder (Figure 5.3.), a branch circuit on one of
        the loops might be identified as Blue Alpha Three. Further, assuming Load 2 is essential, power
        may be maintained to that load by opening breakers at T1, thus isolating and protecting all of Loop
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                  77


      Alpha, except the segment from T3 to B3. Similarly, Branch 3 can be isolated by opening B3 with-
      out affecting service to Loop Alpha. Circuit coding on a map is good, but it is even better when
      circuit components are marked the same way in the field. Most installations already have a coding
      system and have implemented it by marking poles, transformers, etc. All personnel, not just super-
      visors, should know the code.

Figure 5.3. Example of Distribution System Parts.




      5.5.2.4. System modifications can increase isolation and backfeed flexibility. Possibilities for iso-
      lating circuits and backfeeding key facilities are limited only by the layout of the system and the
      funds available. Analyze the existing electrical system, and identify points where switching capa-
      bility can be added. If any threat warrants the cost of the modification, do it. Such modifications
      should be planned with system backup capabilities in mind.
   5.5.3. Redundant or Backup Electrical Systems. Because electrical service is vulnerable to disrup-
   tion, installations should have redundant service and backup equipment in place. For electrical sys-
   tems, that generally means generators and the procedures to keep them operating. Installations should
   be prepared to operate backup equipment for extended periods after a disaster or attack.
      5.5.3.1. Ideally, mission-critical activities should have backup electrical power and automatic
      switchgear, but not all such activities get generators—usually due to limited funding. There are a
      few common-sense steps to getting backup generators in the right places.
          5.5.3.1.1. Identify all critical activities requiring backup power and list them in priority order.
          Logically, this will be the installation facility priority list or a variation of it. This list also
          establishes the priority for placing mobile/EAID or WRM generators and for replacing
          non-operating permanently installed/RPIE generators.
          5.5.3.1.2. Determine the generator size required for each critical load. Decide whether to con-
          solidate loads on a single generator or collocate generators serving critical loads in a geo-
          graphic area. Decide if load transfer must be done automatically or can be done manually.
          5.5.3.1.3. Follow the procedures in AFI 32-1063, Electric Power Systems, to get the genera-
          tors authorized and delivered.
          5.5.3.1.4. Develop an operating agreement with each user that covers generator start-up, load
          transfer, servicing, and equipment maintenance responsibilities. A standard one-page agree-
          ment is sufficient. Provide written generator start-up and load transfer procedures to the user.
          This can be added to the back of the operating agreement. Then train the user’s generator oper-
          ators.
78                                                                       AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


            5.5.3.1.5. In the operating agreements, include procedures for servicing the generators. Most
            important is the need to periodically refuel operating generators. The agreements should spec-
            ify who is to monitor the fuel level, when they are to call for resupply, and who is to deliver
            fuel. For most power plants, CE handles these responsibilities.
            5.5.3.1.6. Add quick connect/disconnect and double throw switchgear to facilities which
            house critical activities. This enables civil engineers to rapidly connect mobile generators and
            restore power to key facilities. This switchgear provides a second backup capability for facili-
            ties which have permanently installed backup power. For key facilities with a relatively large
            non-critical load, consider rewiring the facility to provide dedicated circuits for the critical
            loads. Those critical loads can then be supported from the quick connect/disconnect switch-
            gear. This is important to minimize the sizes and cost of the backup generators.
        5.5.3.2. Installations that conduct large-scale tests of mission performance under commercial
        power-out conditions commonly report the conditions below as major limiting factors (LIMFAC):
            5.5.3.2.1. Limited availability of spare mobile/EAID units. Historically there have not been
            enough generators on installations to satisfy all critical requirements. Obtaining authorization
            for a backup generator requires a very strong justification.
            5.5.3.2.2. Problems in transporting EAID units. This problem can be minimized by putting
            wheels and a towbar on EAID and WRM generators. If that is not possible or cost-effective,
            develop local procedures to use forklifts and vehicles to move generators.
            5.5.3.2.3. Problems with disconnect and reconnect points. This problem is the easiest and
            cheapest to fix of the factors listed here. As mentioned earlier, add weatherproof junction
            boxes with switching devices to key facilities and make certain the junction boxes readily
            accept the cable leads from the generator.
            5.5.3.2.4. Failure to refuel backup units when they are operating. Establish local procedures
            for refueling and servicing operating units. The system user should be heavily involved.
            5.5.3.2.5. Limited manning in the power production shop. This is a tough problem, and there
            are no good solutions. If you can, cross train other CE specialties or vehicle mechanics to help.
            Attachment 3 contains a historical list of effects on base activities caused by unplanned power
            outages. While some of the effects and terminology listed in the attachment may be dated (i.e.,
            microfiche readers, word processors, typewriters, JP-4 fuel, teletype, etc.), they can still serve
            as a source of ideas to plan efficient manpower utilization and counter-measures to offset the
            effects of power outages on today’s operations. Consider those factors in your preparations.
     5.5.4. Physical Protection. The best physical protection is to build the system underground during
     original construction. Second best option is to place it underground as the installation upgrades or
     replaces electrical systems or components for other reasons. In lieu of permanent protection, use expe-
     dient hardening techniques for aboveground elements. Measures such as earth berms and revetments
     can be used to protect power plants, substations, transformers, switch stations, generators, etc.
     Develop operating instructions which detail what is to be protected, how that will be accomplished,
     where the resources are located to do the task, and who will do the work.

5.6. Water System Preparations. In the CONUS, Air Force policy is to use public or private local util-
ity systems as the primary source of potable water, where such service is available. For this reason, only a
few CONUS installations have water treatment plants in operation. Some installations have well fields
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               79


which supplement purchased water, while some isolated CONUS installations depend on wells as the pri-
mary source. At overseas locations, Air Force installations operate treatment plants where commercial
sources are unavailable or below acceptable water quantity or quality.
   5.6.1. System Information. No matter how an installation gets its water, basic system information is
   still required. The installation water system layout with some details can be found in tab G-1 of the
   Base Comprehensive Plan. Be sure to include the information in Annex N of the CE Contingency
   Response Plan. An example of how basic data for a potable water system can be presented is high-
   lighted in Attachment 5. As with the electrical system, the infrastructure support element chief
   should have much of this information already available. Maintain the details on system components in
   at least two locations.
       5.6.1.1. Purchased Water. Purchased water is usually introduced into the installation distribution
       system without further treatment. The configuration of receiving points varies at each installation.
       As a minimum, it consists of a metered receiving valve connected directly to the installation's
       main distribution line. Some installations may require pumps to boost the pressure to distribute
       water. Purchased water may also be fed from the metering point to a storage reservoir. A capability
       is sometimes provided at the point of receipt to introduce additional chlorine or fluorine. For pur-
       chased water, record at least the following information:
          5.6.1.1.1. Capacity and minimum guaranteed quantity from source.
          5.6.1.1.2. Pipe sizes and pressures.
          5.6.1.1.3. Schematic of receiving point.
          5.6.1.1.4. Pump data.
          5.6.1.1.5. Description of chemical addition equipment.
          5.6.1.1.6. Daily chemical requirements and stocks normally on hand.
          5.6.1.1.7. Location, condition, and numbers of spares.
       5.6.1.2. Base Wells. Identify and record the following information for on-base wells.
          5.6.1.2.1. Location, depth, and capacity of wells plus pipe sizes and materials.
          5.6.1.2.2. Well pump, control panel, and well point data.
          5.6.1.2.3. Backup electrical power or other backup features.
          5.6.1.2.4. Requirement, condition, and location of spares.
       5.6.1.3. Other Installation Sources. A few installations have other sources like rivers, lakes, and
       reservoirs. Collect the information outlined above. Be sure to record the quantity of water avail-
       able from those sources. That quantity can vary by season and during periods of drought.
       5.6.1.4. Water Treatment. Frequently, when raw water is drawn from deep wells (Figure 5.4.),
       the only treatment required is disinfection. Where shallow well or surface supply sources are used,
       more extensive treatment is required—such as depicted in Figure 5.5. The physical size and type
       of a treatment plant depend on the production requirement and the characteristics of the raw water
       source. Capture the information provided below for water treatment plants.
          5.6.1.4.1. Plant capacity.

          5.6.1.4.2. Flow diagram through the plant. Include a process schematic which indicates back-
          wash and bypass piping.
          5.6.1.4.3. Data on motors, pumps, controls, valves, and other components (either indicate on
          schematic or as insets).
          5.6.1.4.4. Main power supply to plant and backup power.
          5.6.1.4.5. Daily requirement for chemicals used in the treatment process—requirements vary
          with raw water characteristics. Also list normal on-hand stock levels. Note: For contingency
          planning, follow MAJCOM stocking guidance. In the absence of such guidance, consider
          stocking a 15-day supply in CONUS and a 30-45 day supply for overseas. Base the number of
          days on how long it takes to typically get the product in hand. Allow for disrupted supply and
          transportation in a contingency. If disinfectant is provided in pressurized cylinders, consider a
          100 percent backup of dry powder disinfectant for contingency operations

      5.6.1.5. Distribution System. Once rendered potable, water is introduced into the distribution
      system. Well designed distribution systems are laid out in loops (Figure 5.6.) to provide continu-
      ous flow to any point in the system from at least two directions. This provides redundancy with a

                                      Water Distribution Elements
            Element                                               Purpose
Distribution Mains               Pipelines that carry water from the source to the users.
Arterial Mains                   Distribution mains of large diameter which are interconnected with
                                 smaller distribution mains to form a complete grid system.
Service Connections              Piping that provides water to individual facilities.
Storage Reservoirs               Structures to store water which is used in periods where demand
                                 outstrips supply; also used to maintain pressure in the distribution
                                 system.
Booster Pumping Stations         As needed within the system to maintain pressure or supply areas of
                                 higher elevation.
Valves                           Used to control flow, regulate pressure, and isolate water lines for repair.
Meters                           Installed as required within the system. Meters gather consumption data
                                 and are also used for billing purposes to reimbursable customers (banks,
                                 AAFES, etc.). Meters are not a priority for repairing or replacing in
                                 contingencies.
82                                                                        AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


            Element                                                Purpose
Backflow Preventers              Devices which protect potable water from contamination.
Fire Hydrants                    Firefighting.
        5.6.1.6. Backup Sources. Describe any backup sources of water and treatment systems readily
        available to the installation. Also cover the installation's over-the-road hauling capabilities. Iden-
        tify the location of equipment and points of contact.
        5.6.1.7. Vulnerability Assessment. Water treatment facilities and underground distribution lines
        are not especially vulnerable to enemy attack or natural disasters, but be sure to annotate system
        maps pinpointing segments which are above grade and consider their vulnerability. As seen
        repeatedly in the Great Midwest Flood along the Mississippi River in 1993, water treatment plants
        located in low areas are vulnerable. Many were forced out of service because they could not keep
        the flood waters out of the treatment structures. While other targets are more attractive, water
        treatment plants and storage tanks can be peacetime or wartime targets for terrorists using chemi-
        cal or biological contaminants. Water mains are normally carried across ravines and streams or
        drainage ditches either on the underside of road bridges or by structures erected only for the pur-
        pose of carrying the water main. Such features are especially vulnerable during floods, but that
        may not be a big problem if there are no critical users on the other side. At older installations, look
        for long, dead-end runs. These may have once served large complexes which have since been
        demolished, but the mains are still in service to supply a single facility. Such segments comprise a
        vulnerable component of the system that must be taken into account in the planning of isolation
        procedures.
        5.6.1.8. Critical Facility Requirements. Plot the location of facilities or activities which require
        water to perform mission-critical tasks. For each location, list the specific water requirements:
        volume of water, total quantity, pressure, water quality, when needed, etc. Record fire protection
        requirements in Annex N of the CE Contingency Response Plan. Program for construction of
        additional storage capacity if the fire protection requirements exceed existing potable storage
        capacity.
     5.6.2. System Isolation. Isolation enables an installation to provide continued service while valving
     off redundant paths to avoid excessive loss of pressure and storage capacity if the system is inter-
     dicted. Firefighting operations depend on an operational water distribution system. Since the system is
     normally buried and not particularly vulnerable, plan to leave the system pressurized for contingen-
     cies.
        5.6.2.1. Develop isolation procedures that specify which distribution lines to isolate, which valves
        to open or close, in what preferred sequence, and by whom. As a minimum, identify primary and
        alternate lines to critical users. Incorporate procedures in OIs and develop checklists from them.
        Be sure your procedures call for immediate notification to the fire protection chief. If possible,
        also warn key users. This can be done through the installation control center or emergency opera-
        tions center (EOC). Don't get too excessive with isolation plans—keep it simple. If necessary, cut
        off water near the storage tanks to avoid a major loss of water. Then quickly narrow the affected
        area. With current drawings, basic engineering judgment will suffice to direct on-the-spot
        response.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               83


     5.6.2.2. Set up a coding scheme to distinguish between the many similar features of an installation
     water system. As with the electrical system, you can use a scheme of color codes, letters, and num-
     bers to enable crews to identify and isolate segments of the system rapidly in a variety of circum-
     stances.
     5.6.2.3. Locate and exercise valves periodically to make sure they work and can be easily found.
     Mark valve locations at the site and annotate system maps. Include detailed descriptions about
     where to find each valve in case the in-field markings are lost. This is especially important where
     there are two or more valves located next to each other. The shop chief should ensure new person-
     nel know where the valves are located.
  5.6.3. Redundant or Backup Water Systems. If you cannot distribute potable water through the
  water system, the installation must look at hauling water. In Desert Storm, bottled water was used ini-
  tially. This dropped off as bare base treatment and distribution capabilities picked up. Hauling water
  in bulk tanks is also a good solution. With a moderate-size fleet, you may be able to haul enough water
  to satisfy more than human consumption needs. For individual consumption, the installation should
  set up water distribution points. While such points do not have to be at fixed locations, it is advisable
  to pre-identify likely points which can best serve the installation population. Good drainage is a must
  at every distribution point. Construct distribution points in advance or expediently if you have to.
  Hauling water can involve more than just civil engineers. Base transportation can be involved. With-
  out water tank trucks or trailers, you may need to fabricate tanks which can be placed on the bed of
  any vehicle which can handle the load. Examples include dump trucks, low boys, flat bed trailers, and
  12-ton trucks.
  5.6.4. Physical Protection. Where topography permits, water treatment plants should not be located
  in areas subject to flooding. Treatment plants can be protected by constructing permanent dikes in
  advance or by expediently building sandbag dikes as a flood threatens. If expedient measures are to be
  taken, be sure to develop operating instructions which tell what is to be done, where, by whom, and
  with what resources. It is also a good idea to create guidelines as to when the preparations should be
  started and completed.
  5.6.5. Non-Potable Systems. Non-potable systems are used for firefighting and, on occasion, irriga-
  tion systems. They may either use the potable system as a source or derive their supply from sources
  which could be made potable but are not treated. Deluge systems are found along the hangar line and
  at installations with industrial complexes (aircraft maintenance depots; testing, research and develop-
  ment facilities). Systems used primarily for irrigation generally support recreational facilities (golf
  courses, parks, and sports fields). These systems are mentioned to ensure that these supplies are inven-
  toried for emergency purposes. In the case of deluge systems, pumping facilities equipped with
  backup power are designed into the system. Irrigation sources normally depend on electric power for
  pumping. In a power-out situation, that water is only available to firefighting equipment which has
  suction lift capability. All non-potable systems must be positively separated from potable systems by
  backflow prevention devices. This means you cannot easily inject that water into the installation dis-
  tribution system even if you need it.
  5.6.6. Independent Systems. Remotely located facilities, such as ready alert crew quarters and
  ammunition storage facility offices, are sometimes provided with potable water from independent sys-
  tems. In most cases, only a generator is needed to ensure an uninterrupted supply of potable water. In
  extreme cases, potable water must be supplied over-the-road by tankers.

5.7. Central Heating System Preparations. A few Air Force installations have central heating plants
(Figure 5.7.), and some of those have more than one plant. Steam or hot water is produced at a plant and
is circulated throughout the distribution system to points of use. At those points of use, the steam or hot
water gives up heat which is normally used to provide hot water and warm air. As steam gives up energy,
its temperature and pressure are reduced until it condenses to water. A majority of this water, called con-
densate, is returned to the plant in condensate return lines for reconversion to steam in the boilers. The dif-
ference between the amount of water leaving the plant as steam and that returning to the plant as
condensate is made up at the plant from water which is treated before being fed into a boiler. The process
is known as industrial water treatment and the product is called make-up water. Hot water systems also
have return lines.

Figure 5.7. Central Heating System.




     5.7.1. System Information. Much information on the base central heating systems can be found on
     the G-5 tab of the Base Comprehensive Plan.
        5.7.1.1. Heating Plant Data. The G-5 tab should depict the location of heating plants and their
        associated exterior lines. Identify each plant, its lines, manholes, laterals, facilities served, and
        return system separately. When recording data for each plant and its distribution/return lines, use
        a coding system to distinguish the different elements of the systems. For a plant, record the follow-
        ing data:
            5.7.1.1.1. Identification of each boiler—trade name, year built, year installed, type (water tube
            or fire tube), and size in total heat output (MBTU/hr).
            5.7.1.1.2. Classification—high pressure (above 15 psig) or high temperature hot water
            (HTHW) (above 160 psig or 350oF).
            5.7.1.1.3. Type fuel and storage quantity.
            5.7.1.1.4. Number of operating days possible with amount of fuel typically stored on base dur-
            ing winter.

         5.7.1.1.5. Dual fuel capability (if applicable).
         5.7.1.1.6. Make-up water data—treatment process description, chemicals required for treat-
         ment and amount consumed, and normal stock levels.
         5.7.1.1.7. The ratio of make-up water production capability to make-up water requirement.
         5.7.1.1.8. Location, condition, and number of spares.
     5.7.1.2. Distribution System Data. For each system, identify and code loops, laterals, manholes,
     valves, and traps. Identify points where service may be cut off and system return integrity pre-
     served. Mark above and below ground portions of the system. Show the sizes and operating pres-
     sures of the lines. Record identical data for condensate returns or HTHW returns.
     5.7.1.3. Redundant or Backup Heating Sources. Identify any backup capabilities you may
     have or can get in the local area. Traditionally, there is very little backup capability on an Air
     Force installation. If so designed, some incinerators are equipped with heat recovery systems and
     can serve as emergency sources for limited hot water when primary systems are out of service.
     The full utility of such opportunities can be achieved only when such capabilities are pre-identi-
     fied.
     5.7.1.4. Vulnerability Assessment. Central heating systems are closed-loop systems designed to
     operate on a minimum of make-up water. Thus, they are vulnerable to attack and sabotage. Fortu-
     nately, most of the distribution and condensate lines are buried, thereby making them relatively
     “hard” and not as susceptible to damage from falling or flying debris. The Achilles heels of these
     systems are their dependence on return lines to the plant and the addition of treated hot water.
     When system losses, either by leakage or interdiction, coupled with normal blow down and blow
     off, exceed make-up treatment capability, the operator will be forced to introduce untreated feed
     water (which will quickly destroy the boilers) or must shut the boilers down.
     5.7.1.5. Critical Facility Requirements. Plot the key facilities served by each plant. Look for
     and identify means to provide alternative paths to serve priority requirements in the event the pri-
     mary service path is interrupted. Most steam and HTHW systems contain few alternatives for
     emergency backfeed.
  5.7.2. System Isolation. Develop procedures to isolate service to likely target areas. The objective
  should be to isolate damage while preserving the capability to continue operations to the maximum at
  near-standard pressures and temperatures. Two factors should be considered when deciding to shut a
  system down. First, steam and HTHW systems are slow and cumbersome to bring on line from a cold
  start. Once taken out of service, either as a deliberate precautionary measure or as a result of hostile
  action or accidental occurrence, they cannot be brought back into full service for hours or even days.
  Second, the potential of either system to contribute to secondary damage when interdicted is minor by
  comparison to electricity and gas. Thus the decision to shut down either type of system as a precau-
  tionary action prior to attack or natural disaster must be weighed against the predictable effects of a
  long-term outage. However, orderly and emergency shutdown procedures should be developed to pro-
  tect the heating plant boilers if the distribution/return system is damaged.
  5.7.3. Physical Protection. Protection should be built in the original construction. Because these
  central heating plants are usually so large, expedient measures are not likely to be effective. Each
  installation must decide what protection is warranted and possible. If supplemental protection is not
  feasible, installation units should develop procedures to operate without this utility.

5.8. Gas System Preparations. The gas system may be important for heating and hot water, but its loss
does not usually have an immediate mission impact unless there is a fire hazard due to damaged lines.
Nevertheless, CE should be prepared to isolate and back up this system.
     5.8.1. Engineering Facts. Gas distribution systems are routinely buried. Portions of the system may
     be extended above grade to manifold, valve, adjust pressure, and provide service.
        5.8.1.1. Gas is supplied in the three pressure ranges listed in Table 5.2.

Table 5.2. Gas Pressure Ranges.
                                              Pressure Ranges
High Pressure                         This pressure range is not found in base distribution systems, but it
(Greater than 50 psi)                 may exist (up to 1200 psi) in transmission pipelines that cross Air
                                      Force property.
Medium Pressure                       The maximum distribution design pressure for military installations
(12 to 50 psi)                        is 50 psi.
Low Pressure                          Gas is normally distributed at a pressure from 3 to 8 ounces per
(Less than 12 psi)                    square inch.

        5.8.1.2. The lowest pressures are at the points of service and consumption. Where gas enters a
        building, it is normally regulated to a pressure of about 4 ounces per square inch. Leakage in a sys-
        tem varies with the operating pressure on a system, not with the amount of gas transported or dis-
        tributed. The maintenance of a proper operating pressure is a critical feature for gas distribution.
        All gas appliances (heaters, burners, stoves, pilot lights, etc.) are adjusted for a specific pressure
        range. Although this range is fairly broad, the hazards of natural gas operations increase when sys-
        tem pressures vary significantly from the adjusted pressure. If the pressure drops below 50 percent
        of its adjusted value, the gas in appliances may not light properly or yield enough heat and may
        cause flashback. If appliances are adjusted to accommodate a new low pressure, care must be
        taken when the pressure is again increased to readjust the appliances. At pressures more than 50
        percent above adjustment, carbon deposits, incomplete combustion, or flames blowing off the
        burners can result.
        5.8.1.3. For natural gas, the lower limit of flammability is approximately 4.6 percent in a mixture
        with air, while the upper limit is about 13.9 percent. Neither gas nor air alone is explosive, but the
        mixture of the two is explosive within these upper and lower limits of flammability. The limits
        themselves are approximate because the composition of natural gas is not constant. Its heating
        value varies between 475 and 1,180 BTU/cubic foot.
        5.8.1.4. Because most natural gases are odorless, producers introduce unpleasant odors into the
        gas so that its presence is readily detected in the atmosphere. In the unlikely event that delivered
        gas is odorless, installations should negotiate the inclusion of odor as part of their contract with the
        supplier. As a last resort, install a device, usually on the low pressure side of the pressure regulator,
        to introduce an artificial odor. A variety of approved odors are in use—usually chemically inert
        mercaptans or sulfides with odors described as rotten, sour, putrid, meaty, metallic, and sulfurous.
        5.8.1.5. Only components designed and certified for gas service may be used in gas distribution
        systems. Though many are similar in outside appearance to like items used in water and sewer ser-
        vice, items not designed and certified for use in gas systems may not be used.

  5.8.2. System Information. Much of the gas distribution system data can be found on the G-5 tab of
  the Base Comprehensive Plan along with the central heating system information.
     5.8.2.1. Sources. Installations with natural gas service may have one or more sources, depending
     upon the degree to which the surrounding area has been developed. Each point of receipt has a
     combination of pipes, pressure regulators, meters, and valves. Gather the information listed below
     (as a minimum).
         5.8.2.1.1. Amount of gas the supplier can provide.
         5.8.2.1.2. Name and phone number of supplier's point of contact.
         5.8.2.1.3. Location, description, and schematic of the receiving point.
         5.8.2.1.4. Pipe sizes/materials and normal operating pressures.
     5.8.2.2. Distribution System. Gas system maps must contain as much data as possible on the gas
     system and the relationship of the gas system to other buried utilities and fixed reference points.
     The following information should be recorded on the map and amplified in Annex N of the CE
     Contingency Response Plan.
         5.8.2.2.1. Location, size, and kind of each main line and service line, as well as clearance from
         adjacent utilities (e.g., steam lines, sewers, ducts, manholes, water mains, etc.).
         5.8.2.2.2. Size, type, make and location of each valve in the system, together with the location
         of manholes and high- and low-pressure points. Also record the designated code assigned for
         each valve and district regulator operation.
         5.8.2.2.3. Operating pressures, line sizes, materials, and joint types.
         5.8.2.2.4. Amount, location, and condition of the gas distribution spares. (It may not be neces-
         sary to maintain a high-cost, in-house inventory of spares to support a gas distribution system.
         Where commercial or public systems are present to provide service to installations, the entity
         providing the service can often be depended upon as a ready source of major spare parts. Indi-
         vidual installations need to pre-stock an inventory of emergency repair and smaller replace-
         ment parts, such as patches, clamps, and plugs for medium- and low-pressure applications, and
         focus the majority of the inventory investment in low-pressure plugs, caps, connectors, valves,
         regulators, petcocks, sealants, tubing, etc.)
     5.8.2.3. Independent Systems. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG)
     are the two common fuels sold in bulk for individual systems. The distinction between the two lies
     mainly in their BTU output per unit of measure (normally in BTU/lb). Individual systems nor-
     mally serve only one facility and are in common use where (1) no gas service to an installation is
     provided, or (2) the facility requiring gas service is remotely located from the central system. Ser-
     vice is provided from a high-pressure tank where the gas is held in the liquid state. The gas leaves
     the tank via a valve and pressure regulator where it is piped to the point of use at low pressure. Be
     sure to collect the following information:
         5.8.2.3.1. Location of independent systems, type of gas, and size of tank.
         5.8.2.3.2. How long a full tank can support the facility.
         5.8.2.3.3. Which systems are used to back up critical facility requirements.
88                                                                        AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


        5.8.2.4. Transmission Pipelines. Transmission pipelines cross some Air Force property. While it
        doesn't happen often, such pipelines have ruptured or leaked. Be sure you have a point of contact
        who can quickly stop the flow of gas if such problems arise.
        5.8.2.5. Critical Facility Requirements. If gas service is needed for a critical function, it is more
        prudent to place a backup tank on site than to keep the gas system operating, particularly if the
        threat is an enemy attack.
     5.8.3. System Isolation. There are a number of scenarios where you need to be able to isolate a por-
     tion or all of the gas system, especially to contain the risk of fire and secondary explosions inherent to
     all gas systems. Most often isolation only needs to affect a small area. Develop isolation procedures.
     Make sure shop personnel know where the valves are. Locate and mark the valves in the field and on
     the system maps. Describe where the valves are in case the field markers are lost. As with most utility
     systems, a coding system to identify portions of the gas system can be helpful. The only reasonable
     isolation procedure for individual gas systems is to turn the supply off at the tank.
        5.8.3.1. It is fairly simple to cut off gas service to an entire system or to any portion of the system
        which is valved separately. In contrast, restoration of service to a segment of the system is both
        labor intensive and time-consuming. For example, each individual facility must be valved off at its
        service point prior to reintroducing pressure to the segment. Once the service main is pressurized,
        each facility must be brought on line separately by first securing all appliances within the facility.
        Finally, each appliance within a facility is individually put back into service by relighting and
        adjusting the pilot or checking electric/electronic pilots for proper operation.
        5.8.3.2. Where hostile action is the imminent threat, the correct procedure is to shut off a central
        gas distribution system at the main source. Time permitting, all valves in the system should be
        placed in the “OFF” position. This is best accomplished by working from the farthest point in the
        system toward the main source, cutting off service at each facility. This procedure isolates all seg-
        ments of the system, from appliance to main source, and ensures that a residual pressure remains
        in the system. It also limits the amount of gas available to form a flammable mixture to the gas
        remaining between any two closed valves. Consider the man-hours required to restore service
        before deciding to shut down or completely isolate the system for a threat which is not potentially
        explosive or incendiary. Those man-hours may be needed for other recovery operations.
     5.8.4. Redundant or Backup Gas Service. Where gas service is critical to mission accomplishment
     and the central system is not dependable in a contingency, an individual LNG or LPG system is an
     effective alternate source. As individual systems are resupplied by container on a full-for-empty basis,
     storage is invariably aboveground.
     5.8.5. Physical Protection. Being buried, the gas system is well protected. There is little else you can
     reasonably do to protect the system. You can, however, berm tanks positioned at facilities with critical
     gas requirements.

5.9. Liquid Fuel System Preparations. This may be the most important utility on the installation—cer-
tainly on an installation with a flying mission. It is also unique among utilities in that civil engineers
“own” and maintain it, but supply operates it.
     5.9.1. System Information. Tab G-7 of the Base Comprehensive Plan lays out the installation liquid
     fuels systems. Between that tab and the information in the CE Contingency Response Plan, you
     should have the following information on storage, distribution, and vulnerability.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               89


      5.9.1.1. Storage and Distribution. Bulk fuel products are normally provided to an installation
      either by rail, barge or pipeline. The fuel is typically stored in a tank farm close to the point of
      receipt (Figure 5.8.). If the tanks are some distance from the flight line, where the majority of the
      fuel is usually dispensed, an underground pipeline system is often used to transport fuel to smaller
      tanks commonly called ready tanks. From the ready tanks, fuel is pumped to a hydrant system. It
      may also be moved by refueling vehicles to aircraft, motor vehicles, and other users. The hazard
      presented by the different fuel products varies significantly. Data concerning tank contents and
      transport line contents should be kept current. The base fuels officer must advise the BCE when-
      ever changes are made. The following liquid fuels system information should be recorded:
          5.9.1.1.1. Location, description, and schematic of the receiving points, pump stations, and
          hydrant systems.
          5.9.1.1.2. Pipe sizes/materials and normal operating pressures.
          5.9.1.1.3. Capacity and type of storage tanks.
          5.9.1.1.4. Requirement, condition, and location of spares.

Figure 5.8. Typical POL System.




      5.9.1.2. Vulnerability Assessment. POL systems are a lucrative enemy target; they have a pow-
      erful potential for originating and sustaining secondary damage from a variety of natural and
      man-caused disasters. Because of the importance of this system, most of the components are
      underground or are hardened at installations in PACAF and USAFE. Power to run the system is a
      potentially vulnerable element.
   5.9.2. System Isolation. Develop procedures so CE liquid fuels maintenance or base supply's fuels
   management personnel respond and cut off the flow of product to prevent or contain secondary dam-
   age should the system be damaged. In this case, a redundant response is okay. As with other systems,
   valves should be marked in the field and on the system maps, and each shop person should touch
   every valve to learn where they are. A system coding is helpful to identify the different parts of the
   system.
90                                                                        AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


     5.9.3. Redundant or Backup Liquid Fuel Procedures. If damage to the pipelines or pump houses
     is too great, base supply will use refuelers to move fuel from the bulk storage area. Civil engineers
     may need to give priority to maintaining and repairing haul routes.

5.10. Sanitary Sewage Collection and Disposal System Preparations. System failures in the sanitary
sewage system create a public health hazard more than a direct mission impact. Even so, there are smart
preparations which civil engineers should make. Sewage collection and treatment systems (Figure 5.9.)
are designed for minimum operation and maintenance cost. Therefore, the majority of the system is
designed to flow by gravity.

Figure 5.9. Sewage Treatment System.




     5.10.1. Engineering Data. To permit proper operation of gravity sewers, flow velocities in the pipe
     must be maintained at greater than 2 feet/second and less than 8 feet/second. The amount to be trans-
     ported determines the size of pipe. The pipe size, in combination with terrain slope, determines the
     number and location of pumping stations (called lift stations in practice).
        5.10.1.1. Lift stations are installed where the collected wastes no longer flow with sufficient
        velocity to avoid settling of solids and stagnant conditions. Lift stations may serve only to raise the
        hydraulic grade line to a high enough elevation where gravity continues the flow, or they may
        inject wastewater into pressurized pipelines, called force mains. Force mains are comparatively
        large pipelines (12” or greater) which transport wastewater across relatively long runs where the
        natural grade is not steep enough to provide the necessary velocity.
        5.10.1.2. Lift stations are conventionally two-stage devices. Incoming wastewater flows to a wet
        well where the level is monitored by a float switch. The float switch is set to activate at a predeter-
        mined level to control a pump in the dry well which then picks up the wastewater and lifts it into
        the following stage of the sewer. At the discharge end of the system, a lift station is used to pump
        the wastewater either to a sewage treatment plant or to a regional collection system. All lift sta-
        tions must be provided with a source of alternate or backup power. Installations with operational
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                               91


     Energy Monitoring and Control Systems (EMCS) may have a remote sensing capability installed
     to monitor continuous performance at lift stations. Keeping lift stations in operation during a con-
     tingency should be the priority objective. Stoppages and resulting overflow from the system
     present the greatest hazard from a sanitary collection system. Overflows usually occur from two
     main causes: (1) power failure or damage at lift stations, or (2) debris being either blown or
     washed into the system.
  5.10.2. System Information. Data on the sanitary sewage collection and disposal system should be
  recorded in Annex N of the CE Contingency Response Plan.
     5.10.2.1. Collection System. Data to be gathered, in addition to that contained on a properly
     drawn tab G-2, is not extensive. Focus on lift and other pumping stations. As with other utility sys-
     tems, select a coding and identification procedure (adapted to the local situation) which lends
     itself to rapid, accurate reporting of damage and dispatch of repair crews. The data elements below
     should be recorded concerning the system.
         5.10.2.1.1. Gravity Flow Lines. It is only necessary to ensure that the location of individual
         building sewers is marked on the map. Note direction of flow and size of lines where greater
         than 4” diameter. Record size, direction of flow, and manhole locations for lateral, branch,
         trunk, main, and interceptor sewers.
         5.10.2.1.2. Force Mains. Record size and direction of flow. Also record type of construction,
         design pressure, and quantity.
         5.10.2.1.3. Lift Stations. Record data on motors, pumps, and power requirement. Record data
         on backup power (whether manual or auto start). Estimate minimum elapsed time from loss of
         power to overflow. Estimate times for this condition based on diurnal flow pattern. Record this
         data for each lift station.
     5.10.2.2. Treatment Plants. Treatment plants are relatively “hard” structures and are not lucra-
     tive targets. They are able to withstand the destructive forces common to natural or man-caused
     disasters with little effect on their continued operation. In normal practice, a lift station at the
     receiving point provides sufficient energy to the hydraulic grade to provide flow through the plant
     to the receiving body of water or land disposal area. If the process is more complex, in-plant
     booster pumping may be required. This pumping and its associated power are the vital points in
     the plant for which spares and alternatives may be required in the contingency planning process.
     As a final resort, when plant holding and equalization tanks are insufficient to contain the flow
     from the system, plants are routinely designed with bypass capability which allows discharge of
     untreated effluent directly into a receiving body of water or land application area. Information
     concerning holding capacity and bypass discharge alternatives for a treatment plant must be sum-
     marized in Annex N. A decision to exercise one or more of these options can then be made intelli-
     gently in a contingency.
     5.10.2.3. Regional Connections. Where regional connections to sewage collection and treatment
     systems exist, it has been Air Force policy to effect direct connection as an alternative to maintain-
     ing on-base treatment plants. These connection points consist of a metering device combined with
     a pumping station capable of injecting installation effluent into the regional system. Along with
     the meter, these facilities deserve the same planning considerations as on-base lift stations. They
     are normally located at, or in the vicinity of areas where treatment plants formerly existed. There-
92                                                                       AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


        fore, failure or interdiction of these facilities can result in the release of untreated sewage to the
        topographic storm water and natural drainage pattern for the local area.
     5.10.3. Critical Requirements. The “priority facility” approach is not appropriate in attack prepara-
     tions for sanitary sewage systems. Examine your installation map for areas subject to flooding by sew-
     age when lines, force mains, or lift stations are interdicted. Look for and identify alternate paths or
     means by which sewage can be routed around probable ponding points or away from populated areas.
     Keep escaping sewage away from potable water systems and sources, and keep a positive pressure in
     the potable water system at all times.
     5.10.4. System Isolation and Backup. There are no effective isolation or backup procedures with
     sanitary sewer systems. Civil engineers should develop procedures to mitigate the health hazards
     when it is necessary to divert raw sewage. Super chlorination is one example.

5.11. Airfield Lighting System. Obviously airfield lighting is a mission-critical support element of air
operations (Figure 5.10.). System information, operational and backup procedures, and repair consider-
ations should be prepared in advance and included in the CE Contingency Response Plan.

Figure 5.10. Lighted Runway.




     5.11.1. System Information. Much of the information should be available in the Infrastructure Com-
     ponent Plan and the E-10 tab of the Base Comprehensive Plan. Recommend you gather the following
     information:
        5.11.1.1. Supply. Specify the location of the airfield regulators and, for each location, list the
        number, type, and manufacturer of each regulator. Also provide a description or schematic show-
        ing which elements of the system are controlled by each regulator.
        5.11.1.2. Distribution System. Show the location of the distribution cables (E-10 tab) and con-
        trol cables. Specify the lamp types and voltage.
        5.11.1.3. Backup Sources. Show all locations where lights can be controlled. Identify where
        backup systems, such as bean bag lights (Figure 5.11.) and batteries, are located and how many
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                   93


       there are. Briefly describe and locate backup power sources and state the hours of on-site fuel
       available. Identify minimum generator size (kW) needed.

Figure 5.11. Bean Bag Light.




       5.11.1.4. Vulnerability Assessment. The aboveground elements are most at risk of damage.
       Identify those components (usually the regulator buildings and backup generators) and decide
       how best to protect them.
   5.11.2. Redundant or Backup Airfield Lighting Procedures. Develop procedures for changing
   settings if the air traffic control tower loses primary control. Develop procedures for quickly placing
   backup lights if required.
   5.11.3. Physical Protection. Specify how vulnerable system elements are to be protected. Give brief
   details on when to do the work and who is to do it.
   5.11.4. Repair Considerations. List location, type, and number of spare controllers as well as extra
   cable, lights, lenses, bulbs, etc.

5.12. Demand Reduction. While it doesn't happen often, there can be circumstances when an installa-
tion needs to quickly reduce consumption of a utility. Ideally an installation would be able to throw a
switch, turn a valve, or send a computer command to make this happen, but few installations are set up to
easily isolate service in this way. Consequently, installations need plans to reduce consumption in prede-
termined increments without impacting mission-critical functions.
   5.12.1. Demand reduction can be achieved through voluntary efforts by users or by cutting circuits or
   isolating lines. Voluntary reductions require a committed installation-wide effort and a system for
   rapid notification. No unit should be immune. Even mission priority functions have non-priority activ-
   ities which can be suspended. For many units, the temporary loss of utility service is annoying or
   maybe even a major inconvenience, but most users can develop workable procedures to overcome the
   disruption. For example, if a unit needs power for a computer or small tools, they can move them.
   Civil engineers can help occupants in critical facilities by running separate circuits or lines to just the
   critical areas of the building. Then building occupants can cut off all circuits except for the key circuit.
   Voluntary reductions are the least intrusive to the mission, but tend to be ignored when new person-
   nel—not involved in making the original plans—arrive on base. Notification and compliance through-
94                                                                         AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


     out base housing presents a special challenge. When notified of a problem, especially water,
     occupants tend to fill containers and tubs so they don't run out, which only worsens the problem.
     5.12.2. When voluntary reductions don't work or time is critical, civil engineers can use system isola-
     tion to force reductions. To minimize mission impact, users need to identify key functions. Then the
     circuits or distribution lines which feed those functions can be the last to be isolated. Some installa-
     tions have identified key circuits and rerouted lines to tie critical functions into those circuits. Unless
     time does not permit, the installation commander should approve involuntary cuts. Give as much noti-
     fication to units as possible. Give an after-the-fact explanation and estimated time when service will
     be restored, when necessary.
     5.12.3. Develop a demand reduction plan in 10 percent increments. Identify specific actions which
     users must take for each increment; for example, turning off lights, lowering the thermostat during the
     heating seasons and raising it during air conditioning times, minimizing flushing of toilets, curtailing
     equipment washing, and curtailing functions. The plan should also detail CE actions for each incre-
     ment: which circuits to cut, valves to turn, in what sequence, etc.

5.13. Summary. The objective of utility isolation, backup, and physical protection is to provide contin-
ued utility service to mission-critical users and to minimize damage to the installation's utility systems
through proper advance preparations. Prepare your operating instructions and execution checklists. Doc-
ument the procedures in the CE Contingency Response Plan so there is always a place to turn should the
unit need information on the systems. Finally, use the checklists and practice the procedures periodically
so each person in his or her respective utility shop can effectively respond to the unexpected. For more
specific information on utility isolation, backup, and physical protection, see reference documents listed
in Table 5.3.

                                      BEDDOWN OPERATIONS

6.1. Introduction. A significant amount of planning and preparation must take place in order to ade-
quately beddown incoming forces or disaster victims. For civil engineers, beddown usually means provid-
ing facilities and utility service to military units. An Air Force forces beddown can generally be divided
into three elements—aircraft, personnel, and infrastructure support. Aircraft support provides for mainte-
nance shops, hangars, squadron operations, munitions storage, fuel storage, and other facilities that
directly support the flying mission. Personnel support provides for housing, feeding facilities, latrines,
showers, administrative offices, and other indirect support facilities. Infrastructure support provides the
utility systems, waste disposal, roads, and communications that serve the beddown site. Beddown loca-
tions range from main bases with adequate existing facilities to bare bases with no facilities other than
runways, taxiways, and aircraft parking aprons. Beddown activities are not limited to military deploy-
ments. Military engineers have built extensive tent cities to house refugees and relief personnel for many
decades, and will no doubt be called on again to provide shelter for relief workers or personnel left home-
less by hurricanes and other disasters (Figure 6.1.).

Figure 6.1. Beddown of FEMA Personnel in New Orleans During Hurricane Katrina.




6.2. Beddown Concepts. The unpredictable nature of Air Force deployments dictates that civil engi-
neers be able to provide beddown support for differing situations. Because limited time is usually a factor,
advance preparations must be made or expedient methods must be employed—in some instances, both
approaches can be used.
   6.2.1. Engineer's Role. Beddown support may be provided by in-place or deployed engineers or a
   combination of both. Civil engineers erect, modify, or construct many of the facilities that Air Force
   units need at deployment locations, plus engineers teach other deployed units how to erect their own
   portable shelters such as TEMPER tents. Engineers also set up and operate the utility systems that
   serve the aircraft and personnel support facilities. Ideally, beddowns that support OPLANs are pre-
   planned by the gaining major command (MAJCOM) or a subordinate unit and documented in the
   OPLAN, In-Garrison Expeditionary Support Plan (IGESP), or a joint support plan (JSP). Expect the
   level of detail and quality in those plans to vary. For short-notice deployments and disaster recovery
96                                                                       AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


     support, there may be no time for advance planning. Civil engineers will be faced with making an
     existing plan work or developing a new plan on the spot. Whether a plan exists or not, on-site civil
     engineers must provide beddown details. They must be able to develop requirements; sort out bed-
     down priorities to get the critical efforts started quickly—sometimes before all details are known; and
     then site, lay out, and erect or modify the facilities and utility systems.
     6.2.2. Advanced Echelon (ADVON) Team. Hopefully civil engineers are included in any ADVON
     team sent to a non-Air Force installation to prepare for the arrival of the main deployment force.
     ADVON engineers should start developing beddown details, gain a sense of the commander's priori-
     ties, and locate vehicles and supplies. They should begin site layout and may even begin erecting shel-
     ters and providing limited utility support before the main force begins to arrive. Sound beddown
     planning requires user input. ADVON civil engineers should solicit requirements and functional rela-
     tionships from other ADVON members.
     6.2.3. Beddown Timing and Responsibilities. Not all beddown facilities need to be ready for occu-
     pancy before deploying forces start arriving. Because forces flow into an installation over a number of
     days, work can be sequenced to correspond with their arrival. The flow of forces into an installation is
     determined using a force module concept as depicted in Figure 6.2. below. This concept is further
     explained in AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution, and AFMAN 10-219, Vol-
     ume 6, Planning and Design of Expeditionary Airbases. Engineers usually deploy early, but are rarely
     among the first arrivals. Consequently, civil engineers are immediately in a catch-up mode of activity.
     As other units flow in, they should erect their own portable shelters. Of course, CE must show them
     where shelters should be erected, provide them with technical assistance, and set up utility service. A
     major CE assumption is that users erect their own shelters. This assumption is of great consequence,
     because there are rarely enough on-site engineers to complete all beddown tasks for the installation to
     be operationally ready in the required time frame. Following intermediate beddown efforts for a mili-
     tary deployment, users should also be active in developing passive defense measures for their func-
     tions (Figure 6.3.).
     6.2.4. Likely Beddown Locations. Some of the more common beddown locations include a main
     US installation, an allied main base, a bare base, and a civilian community (during disaster relief).
        6.2.4.1. Main Operating Base (MOB). A MOB has extensive facilities in place for the normal
        base mission. Runways, POL facilities, munitions storage areas, and permanent maintenance
        shops exist which are often capable of supporting additive forces. However, depending upon local
        conditions and the size of the deployed force, additional feeding and housing facilities may be
        needed as well as supplemental operational structures. The In-Garrison Expeditionary Support
        Plan (IGESP) should specify which existing facilities incoming forces will use, what modifica-
        tions to those facilities will be required, and what additional facilities will have to be provided.
        Lacking an IGESP, an installation must quickly develop a beddown and reception plan when noti-
        fied of incoming military forces or civilians. The wing logistics plans office usually has the lead
        for this effort, but civil engineers should have a major input on facilities. AFI 10-404 provides
        guidance for preparing the installation-wide plan. Sound beddown plans must always have inputs
        on facility requirements from operations, aircraft maintenance, security forces, services, and other
        functional areas.

      6.2.4.2. Collocated Operating Base (COB). A COB may have facilities similar to a MOB, but
      those resources are under the control of an allied base commander and may or may not be avail-
      able for use by the deployed force. At most COBs, joint support plans define responsibilities and
      identify facilities available for deployed forces. In the absence of such agreements, a formal or
      informal country-to-country agreement will exist that allows US access to the base. However,
      local operating and support details may have to be negotiated on the spot with the host base com-
      manders in a short-notice situation.
      6.2.4.3. Bare Base. Since facilities for use by US forces are nonexistent at bare bases, beddown
      of deploying forces requires a more extensive effort from civil engineers. With the exception of
98                                                                        AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


        the runway, aircraft parking areas, and a nearby source of water, civil engineers may have to start
        from scratch to provide basic services. A tent city, or suitable substitute, must be erected to shelter
        deployed forces. Basic utilities (including water, electricity, heat, sanitation) and other services
        must be established. Aircraft parking areas may need to be expanded, revetments constructed,
        POL facilities developed, aircraft shelters and maintenance shops erected, and the runway modi-
        fied or repaired.
        6.2.4.4. Civilian Communities. Less often, civil engineers may be tasked to set up tent cities in
        civilian communities to temporarily house disaster victims and/or deployed disaster relief forces.
        As with a bare base environment, permanent facilities may be nonexistent or unavailable, espe-
        cially following a disaster.
        6.2.4.5. Other Considerations. The environment that civil engineers encounter at potential
        deployment locations can be altered at the last moment by unforeseen factors. For example, the
        contingency situation at the time of deployment can drive a change in the flying mission that may
        dictate unexpected facility needs to accommodate the adjusted incoming forces. Enemy action or
        diplomatic problems may preclude use of a planned location, making it necessary to prepare
        another installation. These possibilities make it essential that civil engineers be qualified to bed-
        down forces in any conceivable environment.
     6.2.5. CONUS Versus Theater Beddown. Force beddown will most often occur at overseas loca-
     tions. During war or times of international crises, combat forces quickly deploy to theater locations to
     support US and allied forces. That scenario drives the need for Air Force civil engineers to have an
     effective force beddown capability. However, CONUS beddown requirements cannot be ignored.
     Besides disaster relief support, some CONUS installations are required to beddown large numbers of
     personnel during periods of increased national readiness.
     6.2.6. Sources of Equipment and Material Support. Quality sources of equipment and material
     support are essential if a force beddown is to proceed without delay. Although no sources should be
     ignored, most materials will come from WRM assets, installation resources, and local area support.
     6.2.7. Manpower. Engineer manpower for force beddown operations is likely to come from Prime
     BEEF teams, RED HORSE units, and local contractors. Prime BEEF teams are the cornerstone of
     engineer beddown support, especially when OPLANs call for simultaneous deployments to many
     locations. Although limited in number and therefore subject to availability, RED HORSE units have
     the heavy construction skills and equipment needed for major beddown construction. Even in those
     instances, Prime BEEF personnel will likely assist in the beddown and will certainly provide the con-
     tinuing expeditionary combat support (ECS) for the site. In many locations, it is possible to contract
     support from local construction firms to supplement Air Force engineer capabilities.
     6.2.8. Construction Standards. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) established construction standards
     that outline the types of materials and construction techniques to use when constructing facilities in
     support of joint operations. According to Joint Publication (JP) 3-34, Joint Engineer Operations, these
     standards minimize the engineer effort and logistics support requirements while providing facilities of
     a quality consistent with mission requirements, personnel health and safety, and expected availability
     of construction resources. The standards are the same for all services where mission requirements are
     similar. The two standards used for short-term contingencies are Initial and Temporary.
        6.2.8.1. Initial Standard. This standard is characterized by austere facilities with limited life
        ranging from 1 to 6 months (depending on the specific facility) and, in some cases, requiring
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                     99


        replacement by more substantial or durable facilities. These facilities require minimum engineer
        construction effort. This standard is intended for immediate austere operational support of units
        upon arrival in theater. Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) assets satisfy initial stan-
        dards. This connotation does not mean, however, that they will be replaced after 6 months but that
        they will be used by Air Forces at the onset of a conflict. It is possible that some of these mobile
        assets will last several years before needing replacement.
        6.2.8.2. Temporary Standard. This standard is characterized by minimum facilities requiring
        additional engineering effort above that required for initial standards. Temporary standard air
        bases provide for sustained operations above the requirements of initial standards at locations
        where a long-term presence is not anticipated. The temporary standards may be used from the start
        of an operation or as an upgrade from initial standards if directed by the combatant commander for
        mission requirements. Temporary standards should increase the efficiency of operations, safety,
        durability, morale, and health standards for deployed personnel.
        6.2.8.3. Most force beddown operations use the initial standard unless circumstances dictate oth-
        erwise. Table 6.1. illustrates the types of construction considered under initial and temporary stan-
        dards. Civil engineers tend to focus on tent and shelter erection activities of a beddown, but this
        table shows that a beddown can include many other types of work.

NOTE: The type of airfield surfacing to be used under temporary standards should be based on
expected numbers of landings and takeoffs (cycles) by aircraft type and on the pavement loading by
those aircraft.

6.3. Beddown Facilities and Utilities. Identifying existing facilities or potential cantonment areas for
beddown of incoming military forces, federal assistance teams, or disaster victims is an important disaster
or attack preparation. However, CE beddown preparations do not end there; potable water sources, elec-
tricity, latrines, showers, refuse collection and disposal, and contaminated waste collection and disposal
are all areas that must be addressed for expedient beddown operations. This section discusses some gen-
eral concepts and elements of beddown operations.
      6.3.1. Beddown Facilities. There are many ways to satisfy contingency facility requirements.
      Always seek the solution that provides needed facilities in the least possible time. The following
      options are listed ranging in order from most expedient to most time-consuming.
         6.3.1.1. Identify Like Facilities to Share. The quickest way to provide a facility is to share or
         convert a like facility that performs the same function. Sharing requires no civil engineer
         resources. It is accomplished by increasing the occupancy during a given time period or maintain-
         ing a constant occupancy while going to a multiple-shift operation. User input is essential to mak-
         ing this decision. Some facilities are better suited to support beddown operations than others. On
         MOBs and COBs, there are aircraft hangars, maintenance shops, POL facilities, and munitions
         storage structures. If these facilities are not totally used by the host forces, parts of them can be
         made available to the deployed forces. For example, a portion of aircraft maintenance shops and
         hangars could be devoted to the deployed force's maintenance operation. For billeting, existing
         temporary quarters may accommodate small numbers of deployed personnel. Doubling or tripling
         the peacetime occupancy rate of dormitories is an option.
         6.3.1.2. Identify Candidate Facilities to Convert. Converting a facility is not as quick as shar-
         ing but is still faster than constructing a new structure. In converting a facility, the primary concern
         is function. Do not devote valuable time to cosmetic work to improve the appearance. Deployed
         personnel expect to live under austere conditions. Amenities can be added later when initial bed-
         down activities are complete. This caution applies to all beddown work. Gymnasiums, theaters,
         schools, or chapels are candidates for conversion. If feeding facilities are inadequate, service clubs
         and snack bars with existing kitchen facilities could be quickly converted to provide food to
         incoming troops. Several factors should be considered when selecting structures for conversion.
             6.3.1.2.1. Facility Size. Certain aircraft and maintenance operations dictate the size of the
             facility. For other beddown operations, such as billeting, size is not as critical. For example,
             one hundred personnel could be billeted in one large structure or several smaller buildings.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              101


        However, the construction effort for converting numerous smaller units may be more time-
        consuming than for converting a single large structure.
        6.3.1.2.2. Facility Location. The importance of location is a function of the proposed use of
        the structure. A building used for aircraft maintenance or aircraft operations should logically
        be in proximity to the base flightline. The location of other facilities may not be as critical, but
        widely dispersed locations for related functions reduce operational efficiency of the air base.
        6.3.1.2.3. Utilities Available at the Facility. Rerouting utilities could be the most time- con-
        suming task when converting an existing facility. Therefore, first use the structures that do not
        require extensive realignment of utility systems. For example, a gymnasium could be an excel-
        lent candidate for conversion to a billeting area since hot and cold running water, electricity,
        heat, latrines, and shower facilities are in place.
        6.3.1.2.4. Construction Required. The amount of construction required to make a facility
        suitable for the beddown of forces should be a factor in its selection. Since time is a premium
        during beddown, construction should be limited to the minimum amount possible to make the
        facility usable.
        6.3.1.2.5. Construction Priority. The degree of importance that a facility has to the overall
        operation of the air base determines its construction priority. For example, a parking area or
        shelter for deployed combat aircraft will have a higher construction priority than a Base
        Exchange facility for deployed personnel. The wing commander should set the priorities. Be
        prepared to give him or her recommendations.
        6.3.1.2.6. Useful Life of the Converted Facility. Before civil engineers devote extensive
        man-hours and materials to the conversion of a facility, determine how long it will be needed.
        A deployed force needing facility space for only a few weeks probably does not warrant major
        remodeling of buildings or realignment of utility systems.
     6.3.1.3. Identify Temporary Portable Structures if Required. When existing base facilities are
     not adequate to support the beddown, planning for temporary structures will be required (such as
     BEAR assets, locally purchased/contracted portable facilities, or temporary facilities constructed
     locally) to accommodate the overflow. Planning for temporary facilities must include the follow-
     ing elements:
        6.3.1.3.1. Site Selection. Good site selection for the temporary facilities improves mission
        performance and minimizes potential land use conflicts, such as siting structures on poorly
        drained soil. Always take time to survey the installation and develop a reasonable siting plan,
        even if it has to be done as war threatens or after a disaster strikes. Do not take a lot of time
        during a crisis, because the plan does not have to be perfect. The degree of siting flexibility
        depends on the beddown location. At a MOB or COB, much of the land area may already be
        developed. At a bare base or other less developed location, civil engineers usually have more
        latitude. Commanders may have strong opinions on facility siting. Get those inputs early in the
        beddown effort by presenting a sound siting proposal. Consider the following siting factors
        which are divided into six general categories:
            6.3.1.3.1.1. Geographic Features of the Installation. Using maps and visual surveys,
            determine the physical features of the beddown location. Mark unsuitable areas on the
            developmental map.
102                                                            AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


         6.3.1.3.1.1.1. Topography. The topography of the installation is a major siting factor.
         Look closely at the natural drainage patterns of the site. Attempt to site all facilities so
         that cross drainage occurs, and avoid locations susceptible to ponding or flooding.
         Also, attempt to use natural contours when installing utility systems—let the force of
         gravity help move water and sewage. This cuts down on the number of pumps needed,
         which decreases the loads on electrical systems. Lastly, look for areas that require the
         least amount of site preparation for beddown activities.
         6.3.1.3.1.1.2. Hydrological Conditions. Consider hydrological conditions such as the
         height of the ground water table and its seasonal variations and the flood characteris-
         tics of rivers and streams bordering the site.
         6.3.1.3.1.1.3. Soil Characteristics. Evaluate the soil and subgrade to determine
         allowable vehicle and building loads.
         6.3.1.3.1.1.4. Ground Cover. Consider the amount of ground cover which must be
         cleared and grubbed. Since time is a limiting factor under most emergency conditions,
         avoid sites with excessive ground cover unless facilities can be dispersed within the
         vegetation without excessive clearing.
      6.3.1.3.1.2. Weather. The climate and weather at the beddown location may impact siting
      decisions.
         6.3.1.3.1.2.1. Wind. Prevailing winds should influence the location of facilities.
         Locate sewage lagoons downwind of the base complex. Prevailing winds should influ-
         ence the orientation of buildings; when possible, do not place facility entrances so they
         face the wind. This lessens the entry of dust and minimizes adverse effects on heating
         and cooling systems.
         6.3.1.3.1.2.2. Solar Considerations. Site facilities such that solar effects are properly
         accommodated; that is, maximized or minimized according to the time of year and lat-
         itudinal location. Sometimes the terrain is so featureless that you have few choices,
         especially in Southwest Asia (SWA).
         6.3.1.3.1.2.3. Rain. The historical amount and frequency of rain or snow will indicate
         the likelihood of flooding and reveal how much of a problem an installation can expe-
         rience with unpaved roads.
         6.3.1.3.1.2.4. Tides. Consider tidal variations at coastal locations and likely storm
         surges if the area is subject to hurricanes or other ocean storms during the projected
         period of beddown.
      6.3.1.3.1.3. Land Use On- and Off-Base. The activities that must take place on base and,
      to a lesser extent, off base are important considerations in site planning.
         6.3.1.3.1.3.1. Functional Relationships. A key consideration when developing site
         layouts is the functional relationships between base activities. The base layout should
         attempt to enhance interactions between base organizations. For example, many main-
         tenance facilities must be on the flight line to facilitate on-aircraft maintenance; how-
         ever, some need not be. The avionics and parachute shops can be removed from the
         flight line when space is limited since direct access to the aircraft is not necessary. Sup-
         ply facilities need not be all in one area either. Locate some warehouses near the air-
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                           103


             craft maintenance facilities to improve response times to the primary supply
             customers. Place the civil engineer and vehicle maintenance functions near one
             another since a large vehicle fleet is involved. Put the main dining hall near the lodging
             area to better serve the base populace. User inputs are the best way to define these rela-
             tionships.
             6.3.1.3.1.3.2. Space for Expansion. Mission requirements change–add additional
             space in area requirements estimates to allow for expansion. Reserve land for expan-
             sion, particularly for functions that could require numerous facility increases, such as
             billeting and supply warehousing and storage. Consider an additional buffer around
             munitions storage areas so that increased munitions levels do not expand or shift
             explosive clear zones into areas where personnel live or work, thereby creating a viola-
             tion of quantity-distance criteria. Allow sufficient space around utility plants so capac-
             ity can be increased without significant modification. Area requirements for a facility
             should also include space for attendant facilities. For example, aircraft parking ramps
             should have enough space to park the aircraft plus sufficient additional area to add
             revetments. Expansion flexibility is too often overlooked in the haste to complete ini-
             tial siting actions. If not considered up front, it can lead to substantial problems later.
             Specifically, it saves the chore of relocating facilities and utilities that civil engineers
             have spent a lot of time erecting or constructing. If wing leadership cannot provide you
             with information on installation growth, make an educated guess using the information
             in this paragraph.
             6.3.1.3.1.3.3. Miscellaneous Support. Another consideration, sometimes overlooked
             during siting, concerns miscellaneous support facilities. They are usually small struc-
             tures, sometimes built by the troops themselves. For example, allow adequate space
             between facility groups to construct protective shelters. On the flight line or in dis-
             persed aircraft parking areas, provide some form of sun shelters at various locations.
             Latrines also need to be sited near high-use areas when distant from the lodging com-
             plex.
             6.3.1.3.1.3.4. Obstructions to Base Operations. Avoid sites with large physical
             obstructions that interfere with base operations or that delay the completion of expedi-
             ent facilities. Check with the operations support squadron to clarify obstruction criteria
             for aircraft operations.
             6.3.1.3.1.3.5. Noise. Siting actions should also take noise conditions into consider-
             ation. Do not site lodging, dining, medical, or MWR-related facilities where their use
             is compromised by excessive noise. Keep these functions away from power plants,
             vehicle maintenance yards, and airfield pavements such as runways, taxiways, and
             warm up pads. Unfortunately, it is difficult to site facilities to avoid aircraft noise at a
             bare base. When siting is not an option to minimize noise interference, civil engineers
             may resort to construction solutions such as berms or walls.
             6.3.1.3.1.3.6. Access Roads and Streets. In beddown situations, transportation assets
             and materials handling equipment (fork lifts, etc.) may be very limited. Place facilities
             such as warehouses near existing roads or streets to improve access and minimize haul-
             ing distances where goods and materials must be moved by hand. This minimizes the
             need for construction of internal roads.

         6.3.1.3.1.3.7. Siting Functions Near the Perimeter. Siting of functions that disturb
         civilian neighbors can create complaints which turn into political pressure to move the
         offending function. When possible, avoid potential problems by keeping nuisance-cre-
         ating activities away from the installation perimeter. A good public relations effort
         early on can reduce complaints.
      6.3.1.3.1.4. Resource Protection. Criteria that protect personnel and equipment must be
      considered during site planning and layout.
         6.3.1.3.1.4.1. Quantity-Distance (Q-D)/Safety Criteria. Personnel need to be pro-
         tected in the event of accidental munitions explosions. Follow the facility separation
         criteria outlined in AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.
         6.3.1.3.1.4.2. Fire Protection. As a rule of thumb, make sure major firefighting vehi-
         cles can comfortably fit between all installation facilities. Not only does this allow
         vehicle access, but also helps prevent the spread of fire from building to building. If
         facilities are dispersed, fire protection distance criteria are normally met.
         6.3.1.3.1.4.3. Redundancy and Dispersal. Siting should consider the need for redun-
         dancy and dispersal. Ensure that backup facilities are not located in close proximity to
         primary facilities. For beddown dispersal, keep at least 60 feet between buildings and
         150 feet between facility groups. Remember, as distances increase, so does the need
         for transporting personnel.
         6.3.1.3.1.4.4. Air Base Defense. Consider base defense requirements when laying out
         the air base. Use land features that aid in the defense of the installation perimeter. Con-
         sider dual fencing of critical portions of the perimeter if resources allow. Construct
         access routes to the installation to permit open line of sight and yet act as a deterrent to
         potential terrorist attacks. Site high-priority assets away from the installation perime-
         ter. Request security forces’ involvement in this planning.
      6.3.1.3.1.5. Utilities and Waste Disposal Siting. A good facility site plan minimizes the
      need for rerouting utility systems that were installed early in the beddown effort. Rerouting
      can cause annoying and even untimely service disruptions. See paragraph 6.3.2. for more
      information on beddown utilities.
         6.3.1.3.1.5.1. Utilities. Many parameters affect utility siting. Multiple plants may be
         needed if the installation population is large or facility dispersal is required. For redun-
         dancy and survivability purposes, plan for looped systems if time and materials are
         available. The degree of facility dispersal dictates the amount of materials needed for
         installation of the systems. A balance must be achieved between facility dispersal and
         utility distribution line lengths. When siting water plants, consider the distance from
         the source or sources–keep the plants on base if possible. Provide water storage at sev-
         eral locations for survivability and firefighting.
         6.3.1.3.1.5.2. Solid Waste Disposal. Set aside areas for landfills if off-base or con-
         tract disposal is not an option. If possible, find locations where clay is available to line
         the pits and reduce ground water contamination. Landfills tend to attract birds and may
         reek of an awful odor. Place landfills away from the approach ends of runways and
         downwind from living areas.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             105


             6.3.1.3.1.6. Available Resources and Other Logistics Factors. Some logistics issues
             can influence facility siting.
                 6.3.1.3.1.6.1. Transportation. Availability of transportation can be an important site
                 selection factor. As an illustration, siting lodging for an aircraft maintenance squadron
                 miles from the flight line presents few problems if adequate vehicles are available to
                 transport personnel. However, the same arrangement at an installation with limited
                 transportation would cause excessive delays during shift changes.
                 6.3.1.3.1.6.2. Availability of Local Materials. If all other considerations are equal,
                 select a site in proximity to local resources. This reduces transportation requirements
                 and base development time.
  6.3.2. Beddown Utilities. Supporting utilities are essential to force beddown (Figure 6.4.). Electric-
  ity is needed for lighting and to power equipment. An effective sanitation system prevents the out-
  break of disease that can disable great numbers of the installation populace. An adequate water supply
  and distribution system are required for subsistence, hygiene, and construction efforts. Depending
  upon the climate, there may be a need to provide heating and air conditioning. The following para-
  graphs present general concepts for providing utilities during beddown operations.
     6.3.2.1. Electrical Systems. For most contingency situations, some electrical support is required
     immediately. Although the development of initial electrical service often slightly lags the erection
     of facilities, it should keep pace.
         6.3.2.1.1. Basic Construction Principle. Avoid constructing new systems unless absolutely
         necessary. Use existing electrical production and distribution systems to the maximum extent
         possible. Delay running power to any facility or function that can do without electricity. For
         example, a warehouse or storage area not used at night may have no immediate need for elec-
         tricity.
         6.3.2.1.2. Power Source. There are two basic sources for satisfying beddown needs—exist-
         ing commercial power (or base-generated power) and portable generators. While the selection
         usually depends on availability, a combination of these methods often offers the best solution.
106                                                                 AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 6.4. Engineers Lay Out Power Cables at Forward Operating Location.




         6.3.2.1.3. Commercial or Base Power. If available, commercial or base power is the best
         source. One weakness of this power source is that these sources can be damaged or destroyed
         during the contingency that prompted the need for force beddown. Commercial power service
         can often be restored relatively quickly following a disaster. However, the needs of the sur-
         rounding civilian community may be such that excess power is unavailable for use by the
         incoming forces. Power from an base plant depends on the damage it incurred during the
         emergency and its capacity to provide the additional power for the deployed forces or dis-
         placed victims. The configuration of the existing distribution system influences where and
         how much power can be supplied in support of beddown facilities.
         6.3.2.1.4. Portable Generators. The likely source of power for most beddown operations is
         portable generators. To aid base refueling efforts, keep the number of generators to a minimum
         when considering facility layouts and be sure to prepare a generator refueling plan. Weather
         can impact generator operations. During extreme cold weather, special lubricants must be
         used, storage batteries must be checked frequently to prevent freezing, and moisture buildup
         on equipment must be removed rapidly to prevent problems. When operating in extreme heat,
         ensure the cooling system is cleaned and flushed at regular intervals and the coolant is main-
         tained at the proper level. It is also a good idea to shelter (Figure 6.5.) generators from the
         effects of solar radiation in hot climates such as in Southwest Asia. Consult AFPAM 10-219,
         Volumes 5 and 6, and AFH 10-222, Volume 5, for more specific information on bare base elec-
         trical systems.

Figure 6.5. Sheltered Generators.




      6.3.2.2. Water System. Water is the most critical need of any beddown population. An adequate
      supply of potable water must be available for human use, such as drinking, cooking, and shower-
      ing. Improperly treated water can spread diseases such as typhoid, dysentery, cholera, and com-
      mon diarrhea. Non-potable water may be used for firefighting, general decontamination, and
      construction. Water systems generally consist of four elements: source, treatment, storage, and
      distribution.
          6.3.2.2.1. Water Sources. The first choice for a water source should be the existing water
          supply system. Often, the next best option is to haul potable water from nearby locations.
          Other sources include lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, wells, springs, ice, snow, distilled sea
          water, and rain collected in catchments. The value of any source depends on many factors:
          proximity to beddown location; quantity of water available versus the demand; amount of
          treatment required; time and effort required to develop the source; ability to pump or transport
          water from the source to the point of use, etc. If you have to use one of these alternate sources
          and everything else is equal, pick the one that appears to be the most sanitary. Water taken
          from any source, except an existing water supply system approved by the Air Force medical
          team, should be treated before use.
          6.3.2.2.2. Water Treatment. The degree of water treatment depends on the level of contami-
          nation. Water from some ground sources may only require chlorination, while water from a
          muddy river requires complete treatment. If contaminated sources must be used and local
          treatment is inadequate, civil engineers must set up at least the treatment and storage compo-
          nents of the water system contained in BEAR assets. The reverse osmosis water purification
          units (ROWPU) in those packages use a process of forcing feed water under high pressure
          through a set of membranes that screen out dissolved solids to make water potable. The
          ROWPU can also purify salt or brackish water. The Air Force currently uses both the
          600-GPH unit shown in Figure 6.6. and the 1500-GPH unit shown in Figure 6.7. Until ROW-
108                                                                 AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


         PUs can be set up, potable water must be hauled in by truck or plane, or individuals must treat
         their own water. This can be accomplished most easily by adding iodine purification tablets or
         calcium hypochlorite ampules to a canteen of water. When no other method is available, water
         may be rendered safe by bringing it to a boil for at least 15 seconds. Disadvantages of boiling
         include the fuel requirement, the time requirement for water to boil and then cool for con-
         sumption, and lack of residual protection against recontamination.

Figure 6.6. 600-GPH Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU).




Figure 6.7. 1500-GPH Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU).




         6.3.2.2.3. Water Storage. If permanent water storage facilities at the beddown location are
         not adequate, temporary storage facilities may be provided by using bladders from BEAR
         assets. Civil engineers can also use tank trucks, water cans, and water bags. Non-potable water
         for firefighting and other uses may be stored in swimming pools, ornamental pools, and aban-
         doned basements.
         6.3.2.2.4. Water Distribution. The existing water distribution system should be used when
         possible. Temporary branch lines can be run from permanent water mains using available pipe
         or even fire hose. Additionally, if sufficient water booster pumps are available, they may be
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              109


          used to provide pressure to an expedient water distribution system. BEAR assets have compo-
          nents sufficient to provide a complete, pressurized water distribution system. For very
          short-term beddowns, it may not be practical to lay extensive distribution lines. Water can be
          hauled to distribution points (water points) where users fill their own water cans and other con-
          tainers (Figure 6.8.). The M149 water trailer is commonly used to distribute water to remote
          locations. For more specific information on bare base water sources, treatment, and distribu-
          tion, refer to AFPAM 10-219, Volumes 5 and 6.

Figure 6.8. Water Distribution Point.




      6.3.2.3. Expedient Heating Systems. The climate gets cold enough in most locations that shel-
      ters require heat at least part of the year. The prevailing weather at the time of beddown dictates
      how soon heat must be provided. BEAR systems provide environmental control units (ECU) to
      heat and air condition the shelters. The H-45 Space Heater and Preway 70,000 BTU Heaters are
      also available and work well in temperate climates. However, fuel must be distributed to these
      heaters; they need to be attended to when they are operating, but they do not require an electrical
      distribution system like ECUs. See AFPAM 10-219, Volumes 5 and 6, for additional details.
      6.3.2.4. Field Sanitation. In any contingency situation, personnel must be protected from disease
      outbreak. Following proper field hygiene and sanitation measures can help control diseases. Such
      measures apply to individual actions and the operations of the entire camp. Civil engineers are
      responsible for the design, construction, and operation of many facilities and services necessary
      for the preservation of health. The primary areas of concern when establishing proper field sanita-
      tion are personal hygiene, waste disposal, and pest control.
          6.3.2.4.1. Personal Hygiene Facilities. Personal hygiene is the practice of health rules to
          safeguard one's own health and the health of others. Good personal hygiene is one of the most
          important factors in the prevention of disease. The following facilities developed by civil engi-
          neers for force beddown contribute to effective personal hygiene.
110                                                                    AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


              6.3.2.4.1.1. Shower and Lavatory. Shower and lavatory areas are essential elements in
              providing for effective hygiene. Personnel must have a place to maintain body cleanliness.
              Consider the factors in Table 6.2. when developing shower and lavatory areas.

Table 6.2. Planning Factors for Showers and Lavatories.
                                            Planning Factors
Direct drainage away from site; otherwise, water may pool around the shower area, creating a bog and
growth area for bacteria and mosquitoes. Do not place the structure on grade and assume water will flow
quickly away from site.
Shower and lavatory facilities will receive extensive use. If set up in GP medium tents and used more
than 30 days, recommend tents be hardbacked.
Heat expedient shower and lavatory areas.
Provide privacy screens at each entrance and exit (plywood or canvas sheet with 2” x 4” bracing). The
TEMPER tent vestibules are sufficient.
Provide benches for dressing and undressing. Additionally, a means of hanging clothes and towels
improves the usefulness of the facility. This can be done with 1” x 6” or 1” x 4” boards, 8' to 16' long,
with nails driven about 1' apart to serve as hooks.
Provide individual shut-off valves at each shower head to conserve water.
Lavatory area for shaving and brushing teeth should be supported by piped water. Each location should
have individual water faucets.
Each lavatory location should have a mirror and light. Provide an electrical outlet for every other
lavatory location.
In very austere conditions, large trash cans with immersion heaters can be positioned inside to provide
hot water. Incorporate procedures to keep them filled and ensure temperature does not exceed 140oF.

              6.3.2.4.1.2. Laundry. A laundry helps maintain personal hygiene and contributes to the
              overall comfort level by providing fresh clothing. Laundry facilities may be set up using
              commercial-type washers and dryers, or a complete field laundry may be operated by a
              deployed Prime RIBS (Readiness in Base Services) team. Primary civil engineer support
              to either type of operation will be in the form of electrical power, an adequate water supply,
              and proper drainage.
          6.3.2.4.2. Waste Disposal. Improper waste disposal provides breeding grounds for numerous
          pathogens, greatly increasing the potential for spread of disease. Therefore, an important
          aspect of force beddown is the development of waste disposal systems. Of primary concern are
          systems for the disposal of human waste, kitchen and bath liquid waste, garbage, and solid
          waste. In some circumstances, engineers must also be concerned with toxic wastes. When
          developing disposal methods, bioenvironmental engineers and the units that generate the
          waste should be major players. Consult AFH 10-222, Volume 4, Environmental Guide for
          Contingency Operations Overseas, for more information on managing waste and wastewater.
              6.3.2.4.2.1. Human Waste. Proper disposal of human waste is one of the most important
              elements in the prevention of disease. Water supplies are easily contaminated by improper
              disposal, resulting in potentially catastrophic outbreaks of disease ranging from dysentery
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              111


             to hepatitis. Preferably deployed teams use existing sewage systems for disposal of human
             wastes at MOBs or COBs. At bare bases, BEAR assets will likely be used. When the situ-
             ation dictates, expedient waste disposal techniques (Table 6.3.) may have to be employed.
             More information and specific construction techniques for these facilities are provided in
             AFPAM 10-219, Volumes 5 and 7.

Table 6.3. Expedient Waste Disposal Methods.
                                  Expedient Methods for Human
                                         Waste Disposal
                                  Portable Toilets
                                  Straddle Trench Latrines
                                  Deep Pit Latrines
                                  Burn-out Latrines
                                  Mound Latrines
                                  Bored Hole Latrines
                                  Pail Latrines
                                  Urine Soakage Pits

             6.3.2.4.2.2. Liquid Waste. Proper disposal of liquid wastes from kitchen and bath sources
             prevents breeding grounds for harmful bacteria. On a MOB or COB, force beddown per-
             sonnel should attempt to connect these facilities to existing sewers. If this is not possible,
             kitchen liquid waste should be processed through a simply-constructed grease trap to
             either a soakage pit or evaporation bed. The grease trap captures most oils and fats that
             prevent, or slow down the clogging of the soil. Grease buildup happens surprisingly
             quickly in grease traps. Periodically inspect and clean grease traps to ensure they continue
             to function properly. Details for constructing these expedient facilities are covered in
             AFPAM 10-219, Volumes 5 and 7.
             6.3.2.4.2.3. Kitchen Garbage. Large-scale beddown operations generate tons of garbage.
             When allowed to accumulate without control, it provides an ideal food source for insects,
             rodents, and other vermin. Two primary means of garbage disposal are incineration and
             burial. On MOBs or COBs, large-scale garbage incinerators, sanitary landfills, or garbage
             collection contracts will exist. In less developed locations, civil engineers may have to
             develop improvised methods to dispose of garbage. In any case, engineers must build gar-
             bage collection points near food preparation facilities and arrange for periodic pickup.
                6.3.2.4.2.3.1. Garbage for short-term beddown operations can be buried in small pits
                or trenches. A pit 4 feet square and 4 feet deep can handle one day's garbage for 100
                personnel. These pits should be filled no closer than 1 foot below ground surface,
                sprayed with insecticide, and mounded over with compacted earth to 1 foot above
                ground surface. Mark each pit with a rectangular sign on top of the mound indicating
                the type of pit and date closed. When larger pits are used, cover the garbage daily.
                Insecticide is not required if 2 feet of compacted soil are used for cover.
112                                                           AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


         6.3.2.4.2.3.2. For longer term operations, garbage can be buried in a continuous trench
         or combined with other solid waste in a sanitary landfill. The size of the trench depends
         upon the size of the force to be supported and the length of stay. Using this method, dirt
         excavated while extending the trench is used to cover and mound the garbage already
         deposited.
         6.3.2.4.2.3.3. Under temporary conditions, relatively small amounts of wet garbage
         can be burned in open incinerators. Expedient open incinerators may be improvised
         from numerous materials readily available at most beddown locations. For example,
         55-gallon drums can be converted to make excellent barrel incinerators. When using a
         drum for an incinerator, ensure it is free of toxic, flammable, or combustible contents.
      6.3.2.4.2.4. Solid Waste. A significant amount of solid waste is also generated at bed-
      down sites. Because this waste also provides an excellent breeding ground for insects and
      rodents, it too must be disposed of properly. Dry combustible waste can be burned, but
      separating the non-combustible materials is often not worth the effort. Open burning is not
      without problems. Smoke can interfere with local aircraft operations and be a nuisance
      downwind. Most often, garbage and solid waste are disposed of in a common sanitary
      landfill, and each day's deposit is covered with soil. Build collection points throughout the
      encampment and especially at locations convenient to the major waste producers. Units
      should carry their own trash to the pickup points. Encourage units to minimize the amount
      of garbage they generate or at least reduce the volume they create by flattening boxes and
      cans. Set up a collection schedule and assign trash collection and disposal tasks to one or
      more crews. See details on sanitary landfills in AFPAM 10-219, Volume 5.
      6.3.2.4.2.5. Toxic Waste. To minimize ground water contamination and other public
      health problems, civil engineers may have to develop disposal options for toxic wastes
      generated on base. The best option is to eliminate the use of those products. When that is
      not possible, set up procedures with installation units that generate toxic materials to min-
      imize their use, collect the used materials, and temporarily store them. Involve base supply
      and base transportation when transporting toxic wastes. In some circumstances, the instal-
      lation may need to follow Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Department of
      Transportation (DOT) rules.
         6.3.2.4.2.5.1. Establish one or more hazardous waste accumulation points. Do not
         commingle incompatible wastes. If possible, construct a holding area to contain any
         spilled liquids. As soon as possible, work on a method to permanently and properly
         dispose of those wastes. Burial is an option, but double seal waste materials when pos-
         sible or place single-sealed containers in a lined pit. If at all possible, do not commin-
         gle toxic wastes with regular garbage and solid waste. Mark burial sites and identify
         the name and amount of each material.
         6.3.2.4.2.5.2. Construct oil-water separators to process drainage from activities such
         as aircraft wash racks, aircraft fuel cell operations, engine maintenance shops, and
         POL storage and transfer facilities. Be sure to set up responsibilities, procedures, and a
         schedule to periodically service the oil-water separators.
      6.3.2.4.2.6. Medical Waste. Work with the site medical team to develop acceptable dis-
      posal methods for medical waste.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             113


           6.3.2.4.3. Pest Control. Control of insects, rodents, and associated vermin is important dur-
           ing force beddown. These pests carry disease and quickly spread contamination throughout the
           air base if left uncontrolled. The primary means of pest control has already been discussed,
           that being proper disposal of waste materials and garbage. However, control of the pest popu-
           lation may require extermination. If that becomes necessary, consult qualified CE pest control-
           lers or the medical public health specialists to determine proper procedures. Insects are
           controlled by spraying an insecticide in and around nesting and feeding areas and fogging or
           spraying throughout the installation. Rodents are controlled with poisons or traps.

6.4. Summary. An effective force beddown capability is essential to support military operations world-
wide. Beddowns are required to accommodate forces deploying to counter an actual or threatened enemy
attack and to shelter victims of natural disasters and man-caused accidents. A good understanding of how
to determine and satisfy beddown requirements is important. To gain a full understanding of the CE bed-
down effort, explore the supporting documents listed in Table 6.4. They provide additional details on bed-
down planning, scheduling, and execution and bare base equipment.

                                      ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS

7.1. Introduction. Planning for environmental hazards is an important step of disaster and attack plan-
ning and preparations. Installations must have a plan that outlines how the base will respond to a hazard-
ous material release or spill. Although the base civil engineer is responsible for the hazardous materials
(HAZMAT) plan, active support by all base organizations is required. Rather than a stand-alone plan,
some installations may incorporate the HAZMAT plan as an appendix in the CEMP 10-2. This chapter
provides only a brief discussion of HAZMAT planning, capability assessment, and spill response consid-
erations. The primary guidance for establishing and maintaining a HAZMAT program at Air Force instal-
lations is AFMAN 32-4013, Hazardous Material Emergency Planning and Response Guide, (until
rescinded by AFMAN 10-2502 Series publications). For contingency operations in foreign countries,
consult AFH 10-222, Volume 4 which contains guidance on environmental considerations for Air Force
civil engineer personnel deployed in support of overseas contingency operations.

7.2. HAZMAT Response Planning. In planning a response to a hazardous materials release or spill, a
hazards analysis is an important step in the preparation process. The hazards analysis is a three-step, deci-
sion-making process of collecting and analyzing information on potential HAZMAT releases. It is used to
obtain a clear understanding of what hazards exist and the risk posed to personnel, property, missions, and
the environment. The information developed in a hazards analysis provides the basis for notification and
reporting requirements, establishes subsequent planning priorities, and provides the documentation to
support HAZMAT planning and response efforts. There are three key components associated with hazards
analysis: hazard identification, vulnerability analysis, and risk analysis (Table 7.1.). Developing a com-
plete hazards analysis that examines all hazards, vulnerabilities, and risks may not be practical. The
HAZMAT emergency planning team should determine the level of thoroughness needed. Resources
should be concentrated on those situations which present the greatest potential risk or those situations
most likely to occur.

Table 7.1. Hazards Analysis Process.
      Hazard Identification           Vulnerability Analysis                    Risk Analysis
Chemical Identity                  Vulnerability Zone              Likelihood of a Release Occurring
Location                           Human Populations               Severity of the Consequences
Quantity                           Critical Facilities
Nature of Hazard                   Environment

      7.2.1. Hazard Identification. Hazard Identification is the primary component in hazards analysis
      which identifies hazardous materials at specific locations or throughout the installation that are at or
      above the screening levels and the release prevention measures in effect at each location.
      7.2.2. Vulnerability Analysis. This is an assessment of areas potentially affected by the release of a
      hazardous material. It includes gathering information on the extent of the vulnerable zone, conditions
      that influence the zone, size and type of population within the zone, property that might be damaged,
      and the environment that might be affected.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              115


   7.2.3. Risk Analysis. Risk analysis is an assessment of the likelihood of an accidental release of a
   hazardous material and the consequences that might result based on the estimated vulnerable zones.
   Risk analysis is based on the history of previous incidents at the installation, mathematical modeling,
   and the best available information.

7.3. HAZMAT Capability Assessment. Following the hazards analysis process, the HAZMAT emer-
gency planning team conducts a thorough capability assessment to identify all installation and local com-
munity resources available for response to HAZMAT releases and determines whether any additional
resources or requirements are necessary. The goal of the HAZMAT emergency planning team is to imple-
ment a risk management program to ensure the resource capability is equal to the installation’s potential
HAZMAT problems. Senior leadership should determine whether or not an unprotected risk exists, and if
one does, modify that risk by either reducing their potential HAZMAT problem, increasing their response
capability, or a combination of both. The HAZMAT emergency planning team, in conjunction with mem-
bers of the emergency operations center and first/emergency responders, should conduct a capability
assessment that accomplishes the following:
   7.3.1. Identifies installation resources available for responding to a HAZMAT release.
   7.3.2. Assesses personnel, funding, information sources, command and control, site management,
   evacuation, personal protective equipment, monitoring, release control and containment, decontami-
   nation, laboratory support, cleanup, and recovery.
   7.3.3. Determines whether the installation needs additional resources to respond effectively.
   7.3.4. Identifies available local community resources, including available commercial services, to
   supplement installation shortfalls.
   7.3.5. Sets up mutual aid agreements, including HAZMAT emergency response provisions, when
   using local community HAZMAT capabilities.
   7.3.6. Identifies HAZMAT capability deficiencies and tracks them until it has implemented corrective
   actions.

7.4. HAZMAT Spill Response Considerations. Every installation tries to prevent spills from occur-
ring. However, in the unlikely event a spill does occur, effective planning and response will help mitigate
the hazard and return the affected area to productive use (Figure 7.1.). Disaster and attack preparations
help to ensure trained personnel or contractors, equipment, and materials are available to help the base
spill response team with containment, cleanup, and site restoration of hazardous substance spills.
   7.4.1. Spill Response Team. Spill response teams provide containment and remediation of hazard-
   ous waste spills. Members vary by installation and type and size of spill response. The spill response
   team may consist of representatives from the offices listed in Table 7.2., as warranted by the magni-
   tude of the incident.

      7.4.2. Containment. Fire Emergency Services (FES) provides containment during a hazardous mate-
      rials response. As first responders to the incident, FES personnel provide command and control, res-
      cue, extinguishment, and containment actions based on the conditions present. First responder actions
      include steps to limit the spread of pollution; evacuation of nonessential personnel; cordoning off the
      danger area; stopping the release; and preventing the spread of the spilled material into gutters, man-
      holes, and storm drains. Once these actions have been accomplished, FES’s involvement normally
      reverts to a support role.
      7.4.3. Site Cleanup and Restoration. Site cleanup and restoration normally involve neutralization,
      recovery, cleanup, and disposition of hazardous waste and are accomplished by trained experts in
      related fields and are not HAZMAT emergency response team functions. Short-term site restoration
      requires the removal of contaminated soil, cleaning exposed surfaces, or taking other immediate
      actions intended to permit workers to resume normal work activities near the spill site. Long-term site
      restoration may require several months to several years to complete. It includes spill site restoration
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                             117


   where hazardous chemicals contaminated large quantities of earth. Long-term site restoration also
   prevents further contamination, restores contaminated earth, and permits productive use of the spill
   site.

7.5. Summary. War and disasters can create unexpected environmental problems. How installations
respond can reduce the hazards, leave them unchanged, or increase them. In crises, sometimes there are
no environmentally acceptable choices of action, but we must have an understanding of the choices we
make and their consequences. Do not use an emergency as an excuse to ignore environmental consider-
ations. That is not smart. Poor choices can affect the installation immediately, such as allowing a toxic
chemical spill to get into the installation drinking water. As a minimum, civil engineer disaster response
actions should not make an environmental problem bigger. This brief discussion should provide some
insight into HAZMAT planning and preparations. For more specific information on environmental haz-
ards and response planning, see reference documents listed in Table 7.3.

                                 SUPPORT TO AND FROM OTHERS

8.1. Introduction. Support between units is a routine activity at most air bases and is necessary to ensure
daily mission accomplishment. Likewise, the support that CE provides to and receives from others during
or after an emergency also helps to ensure mission continuity. Although the examples of support briefly
discussed in this chapter are not all inclusive, all support provided and received by CE should be coordi-
nated with the supporting/supported unit in advance and included in the Comprehensive Emergency Man-
agement Plan (CEMP) 10-2. Training and exercises that periodically test and evaluate support between
units are also good practices. Paragraph 8.2. addresses a few agencies that may provide support to CE dur-
ing emergencies, and paragraph 8.3. briefly discusses support that engineers may typically provide to oth-
ers.

8.2. Support to Civil Engineers. Without the support of other agencies, civil engineers would find it
extremely difficult to perform their mission during a crisis. The information in Table 8.1. is a sample of
installation agencies and the support they could provide to CE after an attack or disaster.

Table 8.1. Support to Civil Engineers.
       Who                                      What Support May Be Needed
Vehicle              Normal in-shop and mobile maintenance and repairs, especially for heavy
Maintenance          equipment. Mutual support can be very beneficial—try hard to support them when
                     they need help. For example, if base power is lost, set them up with a generator. Not
                     only will it allow them to support the installation, but it also helps to ensure your
                     vehicles get fixed.
Base Fuels           On-site fueling of heavy construction vehicles in the field is most helpful. Field
                     refueling can save a lot of time and problems. If they cannot help, look into setting
                     up your own refueling operation. This also applies to refueling emergency
                     generators.
Supply Support       Establish special supply levels for critical, but little used, items for facility /utility
                     system repairs. This helps ensure items are received quickly. A good working
                     relationship with supply personnel can make the difference.
Mission Support      Coordinates critical manpower support to Readiness and Emergency Management
                     Flight for disaster response through Ready Augmentee Program.
Contracting and      Purchase needed supplies and equipment from local sources. Negotiate and fund
Finance              expedient contract support for restoration of essential installation capabilities.
                     Advise on best approach to acquire resources.
Aircraft             Light carts for nighttime work, air compressors, and portable AC units. When
Maintenance          running short of light carts, aircraft maintenance personnel usually have more of
                     them than anyone else on base. They also have air compressors and portable air
                     conditioners that may also be useful.
Services             Provides box lunches or equivalent and rest and relief support for emergency
                     response crews; stocks shelters for contingencies.

8.3. Civil Engineer Support to Others. Whether preparing to beddown incoming forces, respond to a
disaster, or prepare for a possible attack at a forward operating base, civil engineers provide critical sup-
port to base personnel and agencies. The following paragraphs provide some examples of the support CE
provides.
   8.3.1. Individual Unit Assistance. As mentioned earlier, every unit has the responsibility for prepar-
   ing their personnel, equipment, and facilities for war, disaster, and other emergencies. One way CE
   assists individual units is by providing prior instruction in shelter management, CBRN defense, con-
   tamination control, specialized teams, and other wartime and emergency management activities. CE
   also offers units on-the-spot guidance for shelter siting and erecting tents, sandbagging, and defensive
   fighting positions. Additionally, CE constructs berms, revetments, and ditches to support unit passive
   defensive measures.
   8.3.2. Mortuary Activities. The likelihood of a major attack on US air bases has diminished over the
   years. However, the base mortuary officer still needs to plan for processing and burying human
   remains if the number of deaths exceeds the installation’s capability to store or ship the remains home
   quickly. Civil engineers provide labor and equipment to assist the mortuary officer in preparing tem-
   porary cemeteries and mass burial sites for contaminated and non-contaminated remains. These activ-
   ities could involve helping the mortuary officer pre-identify burial locations and making sure the
   burial sites do not create an environmental problem or interfere with other uses for the proposed sites.
   If necessary, EOD personnel assist during the processing of remains by removing any explosive haz-
   ards or residue contained in the remains.
   8.3.3. Casualty and Damage Reports. Casualty and damage reports are generally provided to the
   chain of command after an attack or disaster (Figure 8.1.). All units (primarily through their UCC and
   specialized teams) report casualties, facility damage, and other situations to the EOC. However, CE
   may also be called upon to assist the installation in developing unit casualty and damage reporting
   procedures.

Figure 8.1. Preparations Include Procedures for Recording and Reporting Casualties.




       8.3.3.1. Casualty Reports. When assisting with casualty reporting preparations, consider what
       information needs to be reported and what unit members should do with wounded and deceased
120                                                                       AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


         casualties if discovered. If known, address the location of casualty collection points and be aware
         that these pre-selected collection points may change if affected by the attack or disaster.
         8.3.3.2. Damage Reports. As the focal point for facility structure and repair, civil engineers are
         the logical choice to help the installation develop damage reporting procedures. As previously
         mentioned, all units should report their facility damage up the chain of command. However, do not
         expect unit damage reports to be as detailed as comprehensive damage assessment reports submit-
         ted by CE damage assessment teams. Consider the following when assisting the installation with
         damage reporting preparations: ensure procedures to gather damage assessment inputs from
         installation units are in place; set up damage assessment teams, priorities, and preset travel routes;
         and set up observation posts as needed.
      8.3.4. Maps and Charts. Maps and charts are critical to base recovery after an attack or disaster.
      Although extremely important for decision makers in the ICC, EOC, DCC and other command cen-
      ters, maps and charts may also be instrumental to unit specialized teams and individuals performing
      important recovery tasks (Figure 8.2.). CE preparations may include preparing a master standard grid
      map or maps for installation command and control; disaster response forces, damage assessment
      teams, and CBRN Control Center. Airfield surface maps for minimum operating strip (MOS) selec-
      tion teams may also be required. Response functions need current on-base and off-base maps to per-
      form their missions. Regardless of who prepares them, copies of all maps should be in the primary and
      alternate EOC and DCC. A good preparation step is to list installation requirements for maps and
      charts to support contingency operations and include instructions and an example showing how to
      read the installation grid map.

Figure 8.2. Command Centers, Specialized Teams, and Individuals Utilize Maps.




8.4. Summary. The support between CE and other installation agencies could be essential after an attack
or disaster. The type of support discussed in this chapter highlights only a few examples of the aid and
coordination that may be necessary. These and other coordinated activities not only assist in the base
recovery, but save lives and protect property. Comprehensive base preparations, including combined
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                  121


training and exercises that test the unit’s ability to respond to disasters and attacks, help to ensure mission
continuity in an emergency. Refer to the references in Table 8.2. for more information on the support that
CE provides and receives from other agencies.

                                                    Chapter 9

                                                 BASE DENIAL

9.1. Introduction. The Department of Defense defines denial measures as actions that hinder or deny the
enemy the use of space, personnel, or facilities. It may include destruction, removal, contamination, or
erection of obstructions. In CE contingency response planning, base denial is an overseas theater task. It
can become a CE task when the theater commander directs base evacuation and the destruction of selected
air base systems, military equipment, and supplies. The BCE must prepare in advance a list of candidate
targets. Denial of air base infrastructure, for the large part, will be the responsibility of the civil engineers.
If available, EOD personnel will assist in carrying out some base denial operations using explosives.
However, the BCE has numerous options available to effect denial operations without having to rely on
the use of demolition experts. For the main operating base (MOB) civil engineer, a denial responsibility
includes all militarily significant civil engineer supplies and equipment, base facilities and utilities, and
the airfield pavement system. For BCEs at collocated operating bases (COBs) and bare bases, only USAF
organic equipment is normally considered since real property facilities and utility systems are a host
nation responsibility. This chapter provides guidance on conventional denial procedures to be used at a
deployed location. Non-explosive destruction methods are suggested for each of the basic civil engineer
areas of responsibility. This chapter does not address denial operations at captured locations or specially
identified targets—these types of missions are normally RED HORSE tasks and will generally have a nar-
rower scope of activity.

9.2. Base Denial Considerations. Because air bases have not normally been highly threatened in previ-
ous conflicts, denial of an air base to enemy forces is an undertaking largely unfamiliar to the US military.
However, modern warfare and the forward locations of many air bases now make the requirement for base
denial a possibility. Engineer forces will play a major role in such activities since they control significant
amounts of equipment and supplies useful to an enemy and are most familiar with the utility and facility
aspects of any installation. Furthermore, the explosive demolition expertise resident within an engineer
squadron makes the unit especially capable in base denial activities. Base denial actions are not haphazard
events—they require considerable preplanning and everyone’s support to be carried out effectively.
      9.2.1. The theater commander will describe the policy and extent to which denial operations are car-
      ried out. Denial of key installations and facilities is desirable in most situations. Selected denial targets
      are integrated into the overall strategic and tactical concepts of the theater operations plan and are exe-
      cuted in accordance with war objectives. Actual denial activities will not start until directed by the
      installation commander and only after careful consideration has been given to the possible negative
      impacts of allowing the enemy use of the air base. In addition, consideration must be given to possible
      future use of the air base by US forces. Taking it with you when you leave (evacuation) is the pre-
      ferred method of denial and should be used when conditions permit. That which must be abandoned
      must be denied to the enemy.
      9.2.2. Targets for base denial can come in many forms and one must be selective in choosing which
      targets to address. Base denial carried to the extreme would remove or destroy everything that could
      aid the enemy in any way (Figure 9.1.). Attempting to destroy an entire air base would be an
      extremely time-consuming task and probably beyond the capability of the normal wartime comple-
      ment of engineer forces at an air base. Besides matching manpower and time constraints against the
      scope of the overall denial task, the means selected to deny the intended target should be reasonably
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                123


   available and produce the most damage possible. Targets for base denial could include heavy equip-
   ment, fuel supplies, key buildings, utility substations, airfield pavements, and classified materials, to
   name a few. And each of these could require a differing mode of destruction. In executing base denial
   responsibilities, the BCE’s denial targets should meet one of these criteria:

Figure 9.1. Total Facility Denial.




       9.2.2.1. Require the enemy to divert significant engineer and operational efforts for repair, recon-
       struction, or rehabilitation to resume flying operations or other priority missions.
       9.2.2.2. Prevent the use of abandoned materials, supplies, and equipment to reinforce or augment
       the enemy’s combat capabilities.
   9.2.3. Once installation targets meeting the above criteria are chosen, they must be placed in a priority
   sequence for denial actions. This priority listing is important since time will probably be limited for
   base denial activities, and the most crucial actions (i.e., those actions which cause the greatest degree
   of resource denial) should be performed first. The priority listing must also take into account the inter-
   face and timing between denial actions. If these are not considered, serious problems could result that
   may interrupt and hinder the entire base denial effort. For example, fuel stores could be destroyed
   before evacuation vehicles are fully serviced, traffic routes used by other denial teams could be
   blocked, or power could be cut off to those facilities being used to marshal and prepare equipment and
   supplies for evacuation.
   9.2.4. As mentioned earlier, removal and evacuation of resources is the preferred method of base
   denial. The reasons for this are obvious—the resources are not harmed or damaged and they remain in
   US forces’ control rather than being lost for the remainder of a conflict. Because evacuation opera-
   tions will always be constrained by time and many agencies could be potentially involved in the pro-
   cess, base denial must follow a thoroughly developed and well rehearsed plan that the BCE prepared
   in advance (see AFPAM 10-219, Volume 1, Chapter 2).

9.3. Conventional Base Denial Methods. There are four conventional ways of accomplishing base
denial: item evacuation, selective component removal, destruction, and the use of obstacles. Each method
can have a place in the overall base denial scenario. Because time to effect base denial will usually be
124                                                                      AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


short, attempt to use the procedure or procedures that will give the most rapid results with the least
amount of effort.
      9.3.1. Evacuation. Always give serious consideration to removal of assets as a primary means of
      denial. Convoying vehicles and heavy equipment to a safer location not only denies the equipment to
      the enemy, but also keeps the resource as part of our inventory (Figure 9.2.). In addition, it provides
      transportation for personnel and a means of relocating more critical supplies away from the air base.
      Obviously, because of the logistics involved (fueling, marshalling, loading, etc.), most evacuation
      efforts should be started early in the scheme of things and follow a preplanned schedule.

Figure 9.2. Asset Evacuation.




      9.3.2. Component Removal. If evacuation of a key component is not possible, another excellent
      denial option is selective component removal. This involves removing one or more components from
      equipment (i.e., engines) that renders the item or equipment totally inoperative. Component removal
      can be a fast and easy means of denial; however, one word of caution is in order when using this tech-
      nique—be sure to remove the same item(s) on all like items of equipment; otherwise, a creative oppo-
      nent may be able to cannibalize components from various different machines to make some operative
      again (Figure 9.3.). Lastly, do not forget to pick up any similar spares from bench stocks and supply
      points.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              125


Figure 9.3. Remove Like Components to Prevent Cannibalization.




   9.3.3. Destruction. When using destruction as a means of denial, there are four primary methods
   employed: burning, soaking with water, mechanically damaging, and contaminating. One non-con-
   ventional method of destruction commonly included in many denial plans entails the use of explo-
   sives. However, due to the obvious dangers associated with handling this material, its use is normally
   restricted to specific personnel, namely explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel. Although these
   personnel are part of an installation’s civil engineer complement, they could be heavily tasked to sup-
   port other installation agencies and may only be able to provide limited help in the civil engineer por-
   tion of base denial efforts. The use of conventional, non-explosive methods of base denial will still
   remain the BCE’s primary means of accomplishing the base denial mission.
      9.3.3.1. Fire. Destruction by fire is a good destruction technique for a wide range of materials and
      equipment. Heat can often be used in a selective fashion to deform or warp items that will not
      burn, bringing about dysfunction. Relatively thin gauge ferrous metals are often excellent candi-
      dates for this procedure. Even though fire seems from outward appearances to be an ideal way of
      destroying facilities, this is not always the case. Modern building codes have brought about the
      development of a large variety of building materials that are highly fire resistant. Some of these
      less combustible materials may need to be thoroughly saturated with fuel in order to ensure igni-
      tion. As a result, it is always a good approach to consult the fire department when destruction by
      fire is being considered. A final possible negative point to consider when selecting fire as a
      destruction method is that the smoke normally generated from large burning activities can serve to
      announce withdrawal intentions to an enemy.
      9.3.3.2. Water Soaking. Water can also be an effective means to damage many valuable assets.
      Unlike burning, a great advantage of using water is that it can be done quietly without revealing
      telltale signs of withdrawal intentions to an enemy. It is an excellent way of destroying electrical
      components; however, extreme caution must be used to avoid electrocution when dealing with
      energized circuits. Water can also be used to contaminate a number of substances such as petro-
      leum fuels. In addition, many dry construction materials such as cement can be easily ruined by
      simply drenching them with water (Figure 9.4.).
126                                                                   AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


Figure 9.4. Using Water to Ruin Bags of Cement.




      9.3.3.3. Mechanical Destruction. This is another means which can be used to destroy assets
      without revealing withdrawal intentions to an enemy. Sledge hammers, axes, and wrecking bars
      are some of the more common tools of choice for this destruction technique.
          9.3.3.3.1. More often than not, mechanical destruction is conducted in a very selective manner
          rather than on a random basis. Key components of an item of equipment such as control
          devices and gauges are usually where the emphasis is placed. A cutting torch can also be a use-
          ful tool when used judiciously. Properly trained personnel can use a torch to damage main sup-
          port members of metal structures such as buildings and bridges, eliminating or greatly
          hindering their designed use by an enemy. Though less common, large-scale mechanical
          destruction methods can at times prove to be highly effective as well. This is particularly the
          case when large quantities of equipment or materials must be destroyed or damaged expedi-
          ently. In such situations, heavy equipment can be used to crush items on a massive scale. In
          addition, burial can also prove to be an excellent way of denying a resource to an enemy yet
          still allow its recovery by friendly forces at a future time.
          9.3.3.3.2. On the average MOB, there are normally numerous systems and equipment that
          require lubricants or coolants for proper operation. Reciprocating engines can be made dys-
          functional by simply draining these vital fluids and allowing the engines to run until they over-
          heat and seize-up. Similarly, electrical distribution transformers can be quickly ruined by
          draining their cooling oil while the system is still energized. Lastly, the use of caustic sub-
          stances such as sulfuric and nitric acid may provide yet another useful means of destruction
          denial, particularly when applied to electrical motors and electrical components (Figure 9.5.).
          9.3.3.3.3. Contaminating or adulterating substances may also be used to make many industrial
          items unusable. However, since no one substance is universally applicable, a technical knowl-
          edge of the denial target is a must. For example, sugar can wreak havoc with most reciprocat-
          ing engines when placed in the fuel system. And, as was mentioned earlier, water can also
          cause similar results when mixed with many petroleum-based fuels.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                 127


Figure 9.5. Caustic Fluid Destruction.




   9.3.4. Obstacles. In addition to evacuation, component removal, and destruction, obstacles may be
   employed to deny the use of certain facilities and resources to an enemy. Obstacles may be catego-
   rized as either natural or artificial. Due to the layout of most air bases, your primary concern will focus
   on the construction of artificial obstacles such as those shown in Figure 9.6. Barbed wire entangle-
   ments are also effective personnel obstacles (Figure 9.7.). They may not completely stop enemy
   ground movement but can hinder and greatly slow down their forward progress when coupled with the
   appropriate antipersonnel devices. Check with security forces on your installation concerning the
   placement and installation of antipersonnel devices; it is their responsibility to place these items. The
   use of more substantial obstacles, such as concrete and timber, can temporarily delay roadway access
   or even aircraft operations when applied to airfield surfaces. Depending upon your location, there may
   be numerous other natural objects that could be employed to delay or even deny an enemy’s access to
   your air base—as with many other Prime BEEF functions, creative thinking can be key to the success
   of your effort.

9.4. Base Denial Responsibilities and Techniques.
      9.4.1. General Information. Ensuring that individuals know and understand the methods of base
      denial is only the first step in being able to perform this type of mission. Each individual must also
      know what his or her responsibilities might be and some of the more common techniques that can be
      used to physically accomplish the base denial task.
         9.4.1.1. Normally, not everyone in an organization will play a role in base denial. In fact, the vast
         majority of the base population will usually be directed to evacuate before consequential denial
         actions commence. However, if time permits, base denial activities can be expanded to include a
         large percentage of the base population, but such situations would be the exception rather than the
         norm. Realistically, only a very limited number of personnel, those assigned and trained as mem-
         bers of the base denial team, will remain behind to perform this vital role.
         9.4.1.2. The actual size and composition of the denial team will be dictated by a number of factors
         such as the amount of resources identified for destruction, types of items to be destroyed, and the
         methods of destruction to be employed. Many base denial team assignments will be dictated by
         Air Force Specialties (AFS). For example, it only makes sense to have electrical personnel accom-
         plish base denial actions on electrical systems since they are, as a matter of course, the ones who
         are intimately familiar with what type of action will best incapacitate the system. Likewise, the
         same would apply to HVAC personnel, airfield surfaces and pavements and construction equip-
         ment personnel, fuel systems and liquid fuels systems maintenance personnel, and fire protection
         personnel. A good rule of thumb to follow when determining denial target responsibilities is to use
         the same areas of responsibility that exist under peacetime operations. In other words, if you are
         required to maintain or operate it during peacetime, also expect to be the one responsible for deny-
         ing it to an enemy during wartime.
      9.4.2. Base Denial—Pavement/Equipment Operations.
         9.4.2.1. Pavements and construction equipment personnel will be accountable for roadway, rail-
         way, drainage system, and airfield denial. Airfield pavements denial most often will be brought
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              129


     about through the use of a combination of obstacles and explosives. However, the method
     employed and the extent of damage inflicted will to a large degree be dictated by how soon and
     even if we can anticipate regaining physical control of the property. If it is not unreasonable to
     expect to lose control of the assets for only a short period and enemy use of the airfield during that
     time will be insignificant to the total battle effort, it may be counterproductive to extensively dam-
     age the airfield surfaces. The final decision to seriously deny use of airfield pavements will be
     made at senior command levels, and the BCE must verify the scope of pavement denial require-
     ments before issuing orders to commence denial operations.
     9.4.2.2. Methods for performing denial of pavements, railways, drainage systems, and supporting
     equipment can take several forms. The following are examples of various techniques that can be
     applied, singularly or in combination, to effect denial actions.
        9.4.2.2.1. Use destroyed vehicles and aircraft, concrete blocks, or any kind of material that is
        readily available to create obstacles on the runway.
        9.4.2.2.2. Fill 55-gallon barrels with concrete and place in the aircraft landing area/runway.
        9.4.2.2.3. If the airfield has an asphalt overlay, saturate selected areas with fuel to severely
        damage the surface area.
        9.4.2.2.4. Use heavy equipment such as bulldozers and pavement breakers to scar the surface
        of airfield pavements and damage pavements at intersections and choke points.
        9.4.2.2.5. Place destroyed NAVAIDs, distance-to-go markers, and towers on the runway sur-
        face.
        9.4.2.2.6. Block open drainage ditches with rubble, debris, and airfield damage repair (ADR)
        fill material to cause flooding conditions.
        9.4.2.2.7. Use cement to block major drain areas and break primary drainage piping, particu-
        larly in those locations that would cause major airfield flooding.
        9.4.2.2.8. Destroy fiberglass and metal ADR matting by driving over it with a bulldozer until
        severe deformity occurs. Place this damaged ADR matting on the airfield surfaces. Destroy
        any ADR component kits in the same manner.
        9.4.2.2.9. Intertwine barbed tape or concertina wire around any obstacles placed on pavement
        surfaces.
        9.4.2.2.10. Rip up railroad spurs with heavy equipment, burn crossties, and bend rails. How-
        ever, be careful with timing, because rail movement could be used as a means of personnel and
        equipment evacuation.
        9.4.2.2.11. Destroy and abandon on airfield surfaces any equipment not being evacuated by
        draining the oil and running the equipment.
  9.4.3. Base Denial—Electrical.
     9.4.3.1. Personnel in the electrical systems AFS will be responsible for destruction of the base
     power grid and its associated support complexes. This will normally include primary and second-
     ary distribution systems, major transformer substations, and airfield lighting systems. In addition,
     power production individuals will be responsible for denial activities involving prime power
     plants, portable generators, and aircraft arresting systems.
130                                                                       AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


         9.4.3.2. Methods for physically accomplishing denial of electrical systems are relatively straight
         forward. Use sledge hammers to destroy regulators, transformers, insulators, gauges, and shop
         equipment. Use chain saws to cut utility poles and barrier tapes. Vehicles and heavy equipment
         can be used to pull over towers (e.g., communications, radar, and approach control) and destroy
         arresting barrier facilities. Generators and arresting barrier units can be destroyed by draining
         engine oil as the units are running. Lastly, key items in bench stocks, special levels, and war
         reserve materiel can be destroyed using some of the same methods as above.
      9.4.4. Base Denial—Mechanical.
         9.4.4.1. HVAC personnel will be responsible for disabling all critical base mechanical systems. At
         some theater locations, this may also include cold storage and ice plant facilities. Liquid fuels sys-
         tem maintenance personnel should take necessary steps to deny the use of both their system and
         product. The actual physical destruction of the pipeline itself may not be the easiest and most
         effective way of denying this crucial asset to an enemy. Instead, efforts should concentrate on con-
         tamination of bulk storage supplies and the destruction of key distribution system control compo-
         nents such as automatic valves and pumps.
         9.4.4.2. Denial of mechanical systems is most easily done by physically destroying the compo-
         nents. Use sledge hammers to break coils, motors, condensers, pumps, gauges, heaters, cooling
         units, automatic valves, and system control devices. Use cutting torches to destroy boiler units,
         heavy metal, and spare parts. Contaminate bulk fuel storage facilities by adding water, used oil, or
         similar substances to the fuel supplies. Due to the extreme hazard posed by some liquid fuels,
         draining the fuel out of the storage tanks is not recommended. However, burning of tank farms
         upon evacuation from the installation is a viable denial method.
      9.4.5. Base Denial—Structures and Utilities.
         9.4.5.1. Structures and utility systems personnel have the primary responsibility of destroying
         buildings and the water and sewage distribution systems. Structures individuals should obtain
         technical assistance from firefighting personnel in burning facilities and any other bulk materials
         such as lumber and paint supplies. They should also use their skills with cutting torches to damage
         metal support structures like bridges and aircraft shelter door rail systems. Utility systems person-
         nel should direct their efforts toward disabling both the potable water and sewage distribution sys-
         tems. Some of the key areas to concentrate on here include deep well pumps, pumping stations,
         storage tanks, chlorination equipment, and sewage lift stations.
         9.4.5.2. Numerous methods of denying facilities and supporting utility systems are available.
         Some of the more useful ones include the following:
            9.4.5.2.1. Collapse facilities by using vehicles and cables to remove load-bearing members.
            9.4.5.2.2. Use cutting torches to cut out supporting beams to buildings such as warehouses,
            aircraft hangars, and maintenance areas.
            9.4.5.2.3. Use sledge hammers and jack hammers to break up bricks, concrete block, and con-
            crete walls.
            9.4.5.2.4. Place debris in major drain areas to cause facility flooding.
            9.4.5.2.5. Set fire to facilities that are constructed from easily burned materials.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                131


          9.4.5.2.6. Flood facilities that have below-ground utility rooms and basements or are entirely
          underground.
          9.4.5.2.7. Use sledge hammers to break up pumps, motors, and main water lines within pump
          houses and water plants.
          9.4.5.2.8. Destroy fire hydrants using heavy construction equipment.
          9.4.5.2.9. Drain and puncture water storage facilities.
          9.4.5.2.10. Use cutting torches to cut supporting members of elevated water towers.
          9.4.5.2.11. Pour cement and debris into main sewage lines and manholes.
          9.4.5.2.12. Cut up, burn, or otherwise destroy shop stocks and construction materials.
   9.4.6. Base Denial—Fire Protection. Fire protection personnel will be looked upon to provide tech-
   nical assistance during base denial activities primarily with respect to burning of base facilities and
   supplies. They should also expect to assist in flooding of any base facilities, if necessary. Fire protec-
   tion vehicles should be included as part of the evacuation contingent and should be loaded with as
   much firefighting equipment as possible. Any vehicles left behind should be stripped of parts and
   components, and any firefighting supplies that will not be taken should normally be destroyed.
   9.4.7. Explosive Demolition. Except in extreme cases, traditional engineer crafts personnel will not
   actively conduct explosive demolition. The task falls within the scope of responsibility of explosive
   ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel. Some engineer forces, particularly construction equipment oper-
   ators, can expect to be tasked to support EOD operations if earthwork, excavation, berming, etc., need
   to be accomplished as part of the demolition process. Major critical facilities and airfield pavements
   are the prime candidates for explosive demolition. Procedures governing explosive demolition are
   contained in T.O. 11A-1-66, General Instructions, Demolitions.
   9.4.8. Base Denial Safety. Regardless of specific responsibilities and techniques, effective imple-
   mentation of any base denial activity requires a team effort. As has already been brought out, expect
   time to be very limited and the workload to be excessive. You must follow the priority listing; there is
   a distinct possibility that limited time or resources will not allow you to complete all desired tasks.
   Safety is no less important than during peacetime, even in this hectic environment. Just because haste
   is a prime consideration, do not become a casualty of carelessness. Always let common sense and
   good judgment prevail. Since accomplishing your mission may be a monumental undertaking, the
   bottom line is teamwork. Each team member must be totally capable—knowing what to do, how to do
   it, and when to do it.

9.5. Withdrawal and Evacuation. The final phase of base denial involves withdrawal and evacuation of
base denial team personnel and equipment. As explained in Volume 1 of AFPAM 10-219 these activities
were preplanned during the attack preparation phase of the contingency.
   9.5.1. At the onset of base denial efforts, several key actions must be taken to ensure all personnel are
   aware of their responsibilities and requirements with respect to withdrawal and evacuation once phys-
   ical base denial missions have been completed. As a minimum, all personnel must be informed of the
   following items:
       9.5.1.1. Anticipated time available for base denial actions.
       9.5.1.2. Assembly location(s) for departure convoys.
132                                                                      AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


         9.5.1.3. Convoy method (rail, vehicle, etc.).
         9.5.1.4. Personnel accountability procedures.
         9.5.1.5. Preplanned withdrawal routes and end point locations.
         9.5.1.6. Personal gear requirements.
      9.5.2. While physical base denial actions are ongoing, another group of individuals must be desig-
      nated to prepare the departure convoy for movement. In all likelihood, this group will encompass per-
      sonnel from several base organizations; however, you can plan on having many engineer personnel
      involved as well due to the unique nature of much of the engineer equipment that will be evacuated
      (e.g., fire vehicles, heavy equipment, etc.). These individuals are responsible for accomplishing the
      following tasks:
         9.5.2.1. Gathering and loading supplies and materials to be evacuated on transport vehicles.
         9.5.2.2. Setting up the convoy order of march.
         9.5.2.3. Fueling and servicing of convoy vehicles.
         9.5.2.4. Preparing route maps for convoy drivers.
         9.5.2.5. Gathering and checking communications equipment.
         9.5.2.6. Reconnoitering the route to be taken checking for obstacles, choke points, proper traffic
         signs, etc.
         9.5.2.7. Coordinating with destination point personnel to ensure support for evacuating personnel.
         9.5.2.8. Arranging for en route security forces if necessary.

9.6. Summary. The execution of base denial may be forced by enemy action, or it may be a voluntary,
preplanned event. In either case, base denial prevents or hinders enemy occupation and use of the airfield
complex, its ancillary facilities, and residual resources. The destructive work associated with the execu-
tion of denial measures requires skill and resourcefulness. Employment of explosive demolition methods,
a most effective means to ensure destruction of denial targets, may not be possible for a variety of reasons
(shortage of EOD personnel or explosives, numerous taskings in too short a time frame, requirements to
conceal our intentions, etc.). Highly effective conventional, non-explosive denial methods can be used by
each section within the base civil engineer organization. Once physical base denial actions have been
accomplished, an orderly withdrawal and evacuation complete the base denial process.

Terms
Air Base Defense—Those measures taken to nullify or reduce the effectiveness of enemy attacks on, or
sabotage of, air bases to ensure that the senior commander retains the capability to accomplish assigned
missions.
Airfield Damage Repair (ADR)—The process of using construction equipment, tools, portable
equipment, expendable supplies, and temporary surfacing materials to provide a minimum operating
surface through expedient repair methods.
Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency (AFCESA)—A field operating agency (FOA) located at
Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. The Directorate of Contingency Support (HQ AFCESA/CEX) acts as the
Air Force program manager for Base Civil Engineer (BCE) Contingency Response Planning.
Alert Condition—A level of readiness which military forces are to achieve, usually based on a defined
level of threat. Predetermined preparation instructions are implemented upon declaration of each alert
condition. Examples of alert conditions include defense conditions (DEFCON) and hurricane conditions
(HURCON). Within each condition, there are usually five levels of readiness.
B-1 Revetment—A galvanized metal revetment assembled using metal pins and filled with sand or
similar material. B-1 revetments are often capped with concrete to prevent water from entering the fill
material. They are primarily used to protect parked aircraft, however, they can also be used for facility
hardening.
Bare Base—An installation having minimum essential facilities to house, sustain, and support operations
to include, if required, a stabilized runway, taxiways, and aircraft parking areas. A bare base must have a
source of water that can be made potable. Other requirements to operate under bare base conditions form
a necessary part of the force package deployed to the bare base.
Base Denial—The destruction or denial of vital air base resources so the enemy cannot use them against
friendly forces or for his benefit.
Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR)—Facilities, equipment, and basic infrastructure to
support the beddown of deployed forces and aircraft at austere locations; a critical capability to fielding
expeditionary aerospace forces. Also known as BEAR, the resources include tents, field kitchens, latrine
systems, shop equipment, electrical and power systems, runway systems, aircraft shelters, and water
distribution systems needed to sustain operations.
Beddown—The act of providing facilities, utilities, services, construction, operations and maintenance
support to a deployed force with the overall intent of establishing a basic mission capability.
Bitburg Revetment—A fork lift-moveable revetment made of reinforced concrete usually used for
facility hardening.
CBRN Control Center—A sub-element of the Emergency Operations Center that directs CBRN
reconnaissance activities to shape the hazards and advises the commander on hazards, countermeasures,
and protective actions.
Civil Engineer Control Center—The primary center for controlling CE forces responding to a crisis,
emergency, or other contingency. Synonymous with Damage Control Center.
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                              141


Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense—The methods, plans, procedures
and training required to establish defense measures against the effects of attack by nuclear weapons or
chemical and biological agents.
Chemical Warfare—All aspects of military operations involving the employment of lethal and
incapacitating munitions/agents and the warning and protective measures associated with such offensive
operations. Since riot control agents and herbicides are not considered to be chemical warfare agents,
those two items will be referred to separately or under the broader term “chemical,” which will be used to
include all types of chemical munitions/agents collectively. The term “chemical warfare weapons” may
be used when it is desired to reflect both lethal and incapacitating munitions/agents of either chemical or
biological origin.
Collocated Operating Base (COB)—An active or Reserve allied airfield designated for joint or
unilateral use by US Air Force wartime augmentation forces or for wartime relocation of US Air Force
in-theater forces. COBs are not US installations.
Command and Control—The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander
over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command and control functions
are performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and
procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and
operations in the accomplishment of the mission.
Communications Security (COMSEC)—The protection resulting from all measures designed to deny
unauthorized persons information of value which might be derived from the possession and study of
telecommunications, or to mislead unauthorized persons in their interpretation of the results of such
possession and study. Communications security includes: cryptosecurity, transmission security, emission
security, and physical security of communications security materials and information.
Continental United States (CONUS)—United States territory, including the adjacent territorial waters,
located within North America between Canada and Mexico.
Contingency—An emergency involving military forces caused by natural disasters, terrorists,
subversives, or by required military operations. Due to the uncertainty of the situation, contingencies
require plans, rapid response, and special procedures to ensure the safety and readiness of personnel,
installations, and equipment.
Contingency Response Plan—A base civil engineer plan of action developed in anticipation of all types
of contingencies, emergencies, and disasters.
Contingency Support Staff—See emergency operations center.
Conventional Weapon—A weapon which is neither nuclear, biological, nor chemical.
Counterterrorism—Offensive measures taken to prevent, deter, and respond to terrorism.
Damage Control Center—A command and control node for engineer forces at unit level which controls
CE preparations and recovery activities for disasters and attacks.
Decontamination—The process of making any person, object, or area safe by absorbing, destroying,
neutralizing, making harmless, or removing chemical or biological agents or by removing radioactive
material clinging to or around it.
142                                                                      AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


Defensive Fighting Positions—Fortifications constructed at various locations around an installation to
assist in air base defense operations. These positions can vary from hastily built bunkers to elevated,
hardened towers. Usually constructed to support security forces requirements, fighting positions can also
be built for work party security purposes or specific point defense needs.
Dispersal—Relocation of forces for the purpose of increasing survivability.
Emergency Communications Center (ECC)—A central dispatch capability that includes the minimum
functions of the Fire Alarm Communications Center (FACC), Security Forces Desk, and Medical dispatch
(when applicable).
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—For the purposes of AFIMS, the EOC is the C2 support
element that directs, monitors, and supports the installation’s actions before, during, and after an incident.
The EOC is activated and recalled as necessary by the Installation Commander. The EOC updates the ICC
with ongoing incident status and seeks support through the ICC when on-scene requirements surpass the
installation’s inherent capability and the installation’s cumulative capabilities acquired through mutual aid
agreements. According to the National Response Plan (NRP), the EOC is defined as “The physical
location at which the coordination of information and resources to support attack response and incident
management activities normally takes place. An EOC may be a temporary facility or may be located in a
more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at a higher level of organization within a
jurisdiction. EOCs may be organized by major functional disciplines such as fire, law enforcement, and
medical services; by jurisdiction such as Federal, State, regional, county, city, or tribal; or by some
combination thereof.”
Emergency Support Function (ESF)—ESFs are groupings of capabilities into an organizational
structure that provides the support, resources, program implementation, and services that are most likely
to be needed during an incident. ESFs also serve as the primary operational-level mechanism that
provides support during an incident.
Evacuation—1. Removal of a patient by any of a variety of transport means (air, ground, rail, or sea)
from a theater of military operation or between health service support capabilities for the purpose of
preventing further illness or injury, providing additional care, or providing disposition of patients from the
military health care system. 2. The clearance of personnel, animals, or materiel from a given locality. 3.
The controlled process of collecting, classifying, and shipping unserviceable or abandoned materiel, US
or foreign, to appropriate reclamation, maintenance, technical intelligence, or disposal facilities. 4. The
ordered or authorized departure of non-combatants from a specific area by Department of State,
Department of Defense, or appropriate military commander. This refers to the movement from one area to
another in the same or different countries. The evacuation is caused by unusual or emergency
circumstances and applies equally to command or non-command-sponsored family members.
Expeditionary Site Plan (ESP)—ESPs are chiefly associated with locations without a permanent Air
Force presence and may contain only the minimum data necessary to make initial beddown decisions.
ESPs may be developed in short time frames to meet contingency needs without full staffing or
coordination. It is the installation-level or site plan to support unified and specified command wartime
operations plans as well as MAJCOM supporting plans. It cuts across all functional support areas in a
consolidated view of installation missions, requirements, capabilities, and limitations to plan for actions
and resources supporting war or contingency operations, including deployment, post-deployment, and
employment activities (as appropriate).
AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008                                                                                143


Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)—The detection, identification, on-site evaluation, rendering-safe,
recovery and final disposal of unexploded explosive ordnance. It may also include explosive ordnance
which has become hazardous by damage or deterioration.
Facility—A real property entity consisting of one or more of the following: a building, a structure, a
utility system, pavement, and underlying land. (FEMA uses the term differently. It can be a base, an
installation, an industrial plant, one building or a collection of buildings which together are used to
provide a product or service.)
Force Beddown—The provision of expedient facilities for troop support to provide a platform for the
projection of force. These facilities may include modular or kit-type substitutes.
General Purpose (GP) Vehicles—Vehicles which have no special capabilities and can be used by any
unit. Such vehicles include pickup trucks, sedans, 1 1/2-ton trucks, vans, etc.
Giant Voice System—An installation-wide public address system used to broadcast changes in alert
status and provide personnel warning.
Hardening—The process of providing protection against the effects of conventional weapons. It can also
apply to protection against the side effects of a nuclear attack or against the effects of a chemical or
biological attack.
Harvest Eagle—A nickname for an air transportable package of housekeeping equipment, spare parts,
and supplies required for support of US Air Force general-purpose forces and personnel in bare base
conditions. Examples of Harvest Eagle equipment are water purification units, tents, and showers. Each
kit is designed to provide softwall housekeeping support for 1,100 personnel. (Replaced by Basic
Expeditionary Airfield Resources.)
Harvest Falcon—Harvest Falcon is a nickname given to a selected package of mobile facility, utility, and
equipment assets required to support forces and aircraft under bare base conditions. These WRM assets
are packaged in air transportable sets to include housekeeping, industrial, initial flight line and follow-on
flight line. Harvest Falcon sets are designed to support increments of 1,100 personnel and squadron size
aircraft deployments. (Replaced by Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources.)
Hazardous Material (HAZMAT)—Materials which harm personnel or their environment when not
properly handled.
High Threat Area—An area which, because of its location or strategic targets, is highly susceptible to
enemy attacks.
Host Nation—A nation which receives the forces and/or supplies of allied nations and/or NATO
organizations and permits such forces and supplies to be located on, to operate in, or to transit through its
territory.
Incident Commander (IC)—The command function is directed by the IC, who is the person in charge at
the incident and who must be fully qualified to manage the response. Major responsibilities for the IC
include: performing command activities, such as establishing command; protecting life and property;
controlling personnel and equipment resources; maintaining accountability for responder and public
safety and for task accomplishment; and establishing and maintaining an effective liaison with outside
agencies and organizations, including the EOC when it is activated.
In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan (IGESP)—Primarily developed for locations with a permanent
Air Force presence, and are fully developed by the collaborative planning efforts of many functional
144                                                                        AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


experts with a deliberate planning time line. Replaces the former term Base Support Plan (BSP). All plans
formerly called BSPs will be redesignated IGESPs. The term IGESP describes all plans developed to
meet deliberate planning requirements, contingency planning requirements, and any other site planning
requirements. While the term BSP is superseded; the requirement for robust, structured, and standardized
site planning based on AFI 10-404 remain.
Installation Control Center (ICC)—The ICC directs actions supporting the installation's mission. As
the focal point for installation-wide notification and operation, the ICC receives and sends orders,
information, and requests pertinent to the assigned task.
Joint Support Plan (JSP)—A plan for the reception and beddown of forces which is collectively
developed by the host nation, the theater in-place sponsor, and the affected augmentation unit. The plan
outlines all facets of operations at a collocated operating base to include personnel, facilities, and
equipment.
Level of Threat—The relative likelihood that a specific threat will occur and have an impact on a base or
on friendly forces in a theater of operation. As the level of a threat increases, military forces prepare for it,
usually based on actions predetermined for each defined level of threat.
Limiting Factor (LIMFAC)—A factor or condition that, either temporarily or permanently, impedes
mission accomplishment. Illustrative examples are transportation network deficiencies, lack of in-place
facilities, malpositioned forces or materiel, extreme climatic conditions, distance, transit or overflight
rights, political conditions, etc.
Main Operating Base (MOB)—A base on which all essential buildings and facilities are erected. Total
organizational and intermediate maintenance capability exists for assigned weapon systems. The
intermediate maintenance capability may be expanded to support specific weapon systems deployed to
the MOB.
Minimum Operating Strip (MOS)—As used in this volume, the launch and recovery pavement surface,
selected for repair after an attack, which meets the minimum requirements for operating assigned or
transient aircraft at maximum or combat gross weight.
Mobile Emergency Operations Center (MEOC)—The MEOC is an emergency response vehicle
assigned to the CE Readiness Flight. It provides the IC with command, control, and communications
support for emergency response and recovery operations.
Operations Management Center (OMC)—As one of four elements of the installation control center,
provides 24-hour manning of the Emergency Action Cell to handle communications to and from higher
headquarters, emergency actions, and flight following.
Operations Security (OPSEC)—A process of identifying critical information and subsequently
analyzing friendly actions attendant to operations and other activities to: (a) identify those actions that can
be observed by adversary intelligence systems, (b) determine indicators hostile intelligence systems might
obtain that could be interpreted or pieced together to derive critical information in time to be useful to
adversaries, and (c) select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the
vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary exploitation.
Passive Defense—As used in this volume, measures taken on or around an installation to reduce the
probability of and to minimize the effects of damage caused by hostile action.

Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL)—POL is a generic term for class III supplies. In Air Force use,
it often is used to refer to jet fuels.
Planning Factor—A multiplier used in planning to estimate the amount and type of effort involved in a
contemplated operation. Planning factors are often expressed as rates, ratios, or lengths of time. From an
engineering perspective, planning factors are often expressed as lump sums or on a per aircraft or per
person basis.
Potable Water—Water which is safe for consumption.
Prime BEEF (Base Engineer Emergency Forces)—Worldwide civil engineer forces organized to
provide trained military elements used in direct combat support or emergency recovery from natural
disasters.
Readiness—The ability of US military forces to fight and meet the demands of the national military
strategy. Readiness is the synthesis of two distinct but interrelated levels: (a) Unit Readiness—The ability
to provide capabilities required by the combatant commanders to execute their assigned missions. This is
derived from the ability of each unit to deliver the outputs for which it was designed. (This includes the
ability to deploy and employ without unacceptable delays.) and (b) Joint Readiness—The combatant
commander’s ability to integrate and synchronize ready combat and support forces to execute his/her
assigned missions. (Readiness is one of four components of military capability. The other three are force
structure, modernization, and sustainability.)
RED HORSE—Organizations established to provide the Air Force with a highly mobile, self-sufficient,
rapidly deployable civil engineer heavy force beddown and facility repair capability in a high-threat
environment.
Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU)—A water purification device which uses a series
of membranes to eliminate impurities. The ROWPU is capable of removing dissolved minerals.
Sortie Generation—This term refers to all activities needed to get an aircraft ready to fly. It is used most
often in conjunction with fighter and attack aircraft during periods of intense flying activity when good
coordination of efforts is needed to prepare the maximum number of aircraft for flight in a short period of
time over a period of days.
Special Purpose Vehicle—A vehicle incorporating a special chassis and designed to meet a specialized
requirement. (Any particular type of special purpose vehicle is generally used by only one or two units on
base.)
Standardization Agreement—The record of an agreement among several or all of the member nations to
adopt like or similar military equipment, ammunition, supplies, and stores and operational, logistic, and
administrative procedures. National acceptance of a NATO allied publication issued by the Military
Agency for Standardization may be recorded as a Standardization Agreement (STANAG).
Standoff Distance—A distance maintained between a building or portion thereof and the potential
location for an explosive detonation.
Survivability—Capability of a system to accomplish its mission in the face of an unnatural (man-made)
hostile, scenario-dependent environment. Survivability may be achieved by avoidance, hardness,
proliferation, or reconstitution (or a combination).

TEMPER Tent—A metal framed, fabric covered facility used primarily for billeting and
administrative-type functions. It is the most common facility in the BEAR packages (formerly Harvest
Eagle and Harvest Falcon).
Unexploded Explosive Ordnance (UXO)—Ordnance which has been fused or armed and has been
fired, dropped, launched, or placed and remains unexploded either by malfunction or design.
War and Mobilization Plan (WMP)—The Air Force supporting plan to the Joint Strategic Capabilities
Plan. The six volumes of the WMP extend through the Future Years Defense Program to provide
continuity in short- and mid-range war and mobilization planning. It provides current planning cycle
policies and planning factors for the conduct and support of wartime operations. It establishes
requirements for development of mobilization and production planning programs to support sustained
contingency operations of the programmed forces. The WMP encompasses all functions necessary to
match facilities, manpower, and materiel with planned wartime activity.”
War Reserve Materiel (WRM)—Materiel required in addition to primary operating stocks and mobility
equipment to attain the operational objectives in the scenarios authorized for sustainability planning in the
Defense Planning Guidance. Broad categories are: consumables associated with sortie generation (to
include munitions, aircraft external fuel tanks, racks, adapters, and pylons), vehicles, 463L systems,
materiel handling equipment, aircraft engines, bare base assets, individual clothing and equipment;
munitions and subsistence.

                                      SAMPLE STATUS CHARTS

A2.1. Charts in General. Displaying up-to-date, key information helps CE leaders control the unit's
responses. There is no requirement or standard format for status charts in the CE Damage Control Center
(DCC). This attachment offers samples for six charts: personnel, generator, vehicle, special equipment,
critical supplies and spares, and installation damage status. Develop charts which fit your needs.

A2.2. Personnel Status. A “Key Personnel” chart (Table A2.1.) shows at a glance who is filling what
position at the moment. This chart can be modified to show who fills each position during the second shift
or a second chart can be used. The personnel status chart (Table A2.2.) shows the strength of the unit at a
glance. Unit strength can be accounted for by AFS, shop, or team.

A2.7. Installation Damage and Repair Status. Charts which show damage to the installation and the
repair status are especially useful (Table A2.7.). Consider dividing the chart into functional areas such as
facility damage, utility system damage, airfield pavement damage, and other pavement damage. If you
assign a number to damage assessment reports, tie the visual entry to the paper copy by listing the damage
assessment report number. Use the estimated completion and remarks sections to show if repairs will be
made; estimated or actual start time; estimated or actual completion time; repair effort in man-hours; and
problems with equipment, vehicles, supplies, or personnel which are preventing, stopping, or slowing
repairs. Refer to AFPAM 10-219, Volume 3 for more information on damage assessments and repair/work
priorities.

A2.8. Critical Infrastructure Status. This chart displays the status of facilities, systems, equipment,
services, and other assets so vital to the mission that their incapacity or destruction would have a debilitat-
ing impact on the installation’s ability to execute its missions (Table A2.8.). Key assets and facilities typ-
ically include runways and aircraft taxiways, command, control, and operations centers, fuel systems,
munitions handling, airfield control systems, water, electrical power, communications and information
systems, operational maintenance and repair facilities, hospitals and decontamination facilities, defensive
positions, obstacles, barriers, shelters, lodging and support facilities. Restoration of these facilities and
systems after being damaged or destroyed is usually accomplished according to procedures in the Base
Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2 and CE Contingency Response Plan (CRP);
however, specific facility repair priorities are normally determined by the installation commander.

                     HISTORICAL ENERGY DISRUPTIONS EXPERIENCE

A3.1. Through historical Inspector General tests, unplanned outages, and discussions with various instal-
lation personnel, the Air Force has gained experience with the effects of electrical disruptions.

A3.2. Below is a partial list of observed or projected effects was compiled from those sources.
   A3.2.1. ECM and avionics shops were severely hampered and could not have performed required
   tests and modifications.
   A3.2.2. Doors on hardened aircraft shelters could only be opened by force, after which they could not
   be closed.
   A3.2.3. Carbon monoxide buildup in enclosed buildings forced rapid rotation of personnel.
   A3.2.4. For many of the phones, neither bells nor lights worked, making it difficult to tell if calls were
   coming in.
   A3.2.5. Lack of power for personnel shelters led to communications, management, and safety prob-
   lems.
   A3.2.6. Engineers were so heavily tasked restoring power and keeping generators operating that they
   could not perform other duties such as rapid runway repairs or barrier maintenance and could not par-
   ticipate in a Prime BEEF deployment.
   A3.2.7. Security Police had to use manpower-intensive actions to compensate for lack of backup for
   powered surveillance equipment.
   A3.2.8. Many loudspeakers and alarms were not functional.
   A3.2.9. Some air traffic control functions were lost.
   A3.2.10. The supply squadron's ability to meet refueling requirements was impaired by lack of
   backup power at fuel pumping and dispensing locations.
   A3.2.11. Secure building doors had to be opened to identify personnel requesting entry because out-
   door illumination was insufficient.
   A3.2.12. Equipment was damaged by connections to inappropriate power supplies.
   A3.2.13. Intrabase radio base stations were inoperative.
   A3.2.14. Administrative functions were impaired by lack of microfiche readers, word processors, and
   typewriters.

REFERENCES: As needed. (This attachment provides an example of how you can present utility system
information in the CE Contingency Response Plan. This would be incorporated into an appendix to
Annex N.)


1. BASIC DATA


a. Source. White AFB is supplied with potable water from the Local Water District. Treated water is
pumped through a 24-inch pipeline which runs from the district's treatment plant, a distance of 4.6 kilo-
meters. The pipeline is buried for its entire length, on the east side of State Highway 1 within the
right-of-way. One unmanned booster pumping station is located at distance marker 3.9, immediately
south of the point where State Highway 1 crosses the White River. Maintenance and operation of the pipe-
line is the responsibility of the Water District. Point of contact is:


Local Water District
Superintendent, Mr. J. Federico, Phone 873-2400
Emergency 24 Hour Contact, Phone 873-9110


b. Point of Receipt—Base Facility 1349. The 14-inch pipeline is constantly pressurized to 60 psig ±10
psig. Flow is controlled by a single gate valve housed in Building 1349. This valve is normally closed. It
is manually operated by water plant personnel to receive water into Facility 1350, a nominal 1,000,000
gallon reinforced concrete storage reservoir. This facility measures 85'x 85' x 20' and is set in ground to a
depth of 15 feet. The top is provided with a reinforced concrete cover. Access is provided by a manhole.
The reservoir is at ambient atmospheric pressure. Water is manually controlled to between 15’ and 18’ by
means of an intake valve at the pipeline terminus set in the north wall of Facility 1350 (See Figure
A5.1.—use your own numbering scheme for any figures, drawings or tables you include in your appendi-
ces to Annex N).


c. On Base Production and Storage. There are no facilities for production of on-base potable water. Water
is supplied from a well field for golf course irrigation. There is no provision to treat this product to sup-
plement the potable system. For other irrigation—including athletic fields, the potable system is used.
158                                                                   AFPAM10-219V2 9 JUNE 2008


2. CONSUMPTION AND STORAGE DATA


a. Average Daily Consumption: 1,750,000 gal. (See Figure A5.2.—use your own numbering scheme).
b. Storage Capacity: 1,615,000 gal.


(1) Facility 1350—Receiving Reservoir—810,000 gal.
(2) Facility 650—80’ Elevated Tank—700,000 gal.
(3) Facility 2205—75’ Tower—105,000 gal.


c. On Base Storage as a Percent of Daily Requirement:



        1,615,000
                      =92%
        1,750,000


d. Fire Protection Storage Requirement: 1,990,000 gal. (Refer to UFC 3-230-03A, Water Supply, and
UFC 3-230-09A for information on calculating requirements. Calculations not shown.)


e. Fire Protection Storage Deficit: 1,990,000 - 1,615,000 = 375,000 gal.


3. RECEIVING POINT DATA. Facility 1351 is locally referred to as the “Water Point.” It is in fact a
pumping station which transfers water from the receiving reservoir to the base distribution system. Facil-
ity 1351 is manned on a 24-hour basis by utility operations personnel (two per shift—phone 32482/3/4).
These personnel maintain a constant supply of potable product to the system at a pressure of 30 to 35 psi.
Disinfection is accomplished prior to discharge into the system. A single-line schematic follows:


a. Pumps. The plant uses six Fairbanks Morse centrifugal pumps (two in suction and four in discharge)
rated nominally at 400 gpm. Pumps are individually driven by Westinghouse direct coupled polyphase
squirrel cage motors rated as follows (30 bhp @ 1150 rpm). Primary power is from base distribution.


b. Disinfection. Disinfection is provided by two Wallace and Tierivan Series 800 V-notch chlorinator
units, serviced by a bank of four 1-ton containers continuously in service. Maximum daily use is 1000 lbs
chlorine chemicals. Four 1-ton containers are kept in reserve at the plant. Base Supply maintains nine
1-ton containers on 30-day bench stock.

c. Emergency Power. Emergency power is provided by a 60-kW EAID generator, pad mounted on the
north side of Facility 1351 and connected to the plant power panel via an exterior junction box. Start and
load transfer are manual. Sufficient fuel (DF-1) for 18 hours of operation is stored in the day tank and
underground on side.


d. Spares. Spares are maintained at the plant. Spares listings are maintained at the plant and on file at the
Production Control Center.


4. VULNERABILITY SUMMARY. White AFB is located astride a natural drainage divide of the Red
and Yellow River basins. Approximately 75% of the 4,400 acre reservation drains naturally to the south-
west into the Red River system. The northeast quadrant drains to the east toward the Yellow River basin.
Primary hazards related to the potable water system derive from loss of system pressure and are as fol-
lows:
a. Contamination. Loss of, or suspicion of loss of pressure in any portion of the system subjects the system
to contamination by infiltration.


b. Fire Flow Requirements. In the event of power loss to the pumping equipment or interdiction of the
system, fire protection flow requirements cannot be sustained when system pressures fall below 20 psi.
