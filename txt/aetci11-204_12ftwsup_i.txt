SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This change deletes the requirement to have a spotter in the runway supervisory unit at night
(Table 2.2). A margin bar (|) indicates revision from the previous version.

(12FTW) This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.
Major changes include: Supplement has been renamed due to Joint Basing; Paragraph numbers
were changed to align with the new basic instruction; Flares are now optional at Seguin
Auxiliary Field; and Randolph AFB has terminated any T-6 training at Hondo.

                                           Chapter 1

            PROGRAM OVERVIEW AND ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Overview. Guidance cannot cover all situations. Supervisors are expected to use sound
judgment in determining the requirement for a runway supervisory unit (RSU). The intent is to
provide RSU supervision for the majority of local undergraduate flying training (UFT) and pilot
instructor training (PIT) flying operations; in particular, multiple landings during periods of
student training and solo student operations.
1.2. Recommended Changes and Waivers. Submit suggested improvements to this instruction
via AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through
standardization/evaluation (stan/eval) channels, to HQ AETC/A3FV. Unless otherwise
delegated, 19 AF/DO is waiver authority for this guidance. Waiver requests will be submitted in
message or memorandum format.
1.3. Runway Control Structure (RCS). RCS refers to the structure used by the runway
supervisory unit (RSU) crew. AETC RCSs are usually permanent structures but properly
equipped mobile units may be used. RCSs must be located between the runway threshold and
3,000 feet down the runway, 250 feet from the runway centerline and, when possible, on the side
of the runway opposite the direction of break. Request waivers to RCS location according to
unified facilities criteria (UFC) 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design located at:
http://www.wbdg.org/ccb/DOD/UFC/ufc_3_260_01.pdf.
1.4. Operations Group Commander (OG/CC) Responsibilities. The OG/CC is responsible
for oversight of the RSU program. The OG/CC will:
   1.4.1. Ensure each RSU position is manned by adequately trained and certified personnel.
   1.4.2. Appoint an RSU program manager in writing at the operations group standardization
   and evaluation (OGV) level. Maintain a copy of the appointment memorandum in the
   program continuity binder.
   1.4.3. Appoint T-6, and T-38 RSU training and standardization officers (RSUTSO) in
   writing and ensure a copy of each appointment memorandum is maintained in the program
   continuity binder. Exception: The OG/CC at Sheppard AFB will appoint one T-6 and one T-
   38 RSUTSO.
   1.4.4. Review and certify all controllers AETC Forms 309, RCS/RSU Crewmember
   Evaluation and Qualification Certificate.
   1.4.5. Review the training records and circumstances of controllers who exceed 90-day
   currency requirements to determine their suitability to remain in the RSU program.
   Document the review in the individual’s training folder.
   1.4.6. Ensure RSU control is provided to home station aircraft only. Note: This does not
   prevent an RSU controller from offering advice to other aircraft to prevent an accident. Relay
   advisories through the tower if time and conditions permit.
   1.4.7. Establish procedures to transfer runway and pattern responsibility from one facility to
   another. Overlapping of control is prohibited. Granting the tower access to an RSU-
 6                                                AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010


     controlled runway for a transient takeoff or landing does not require transfer of runway
     control. Transfer of runway control must however, be accomplished if emergency vehicles
     require access to or across an RSU controlled runway. The RSU may keep pattern control but
     controllers will not allow any aircraft to takeoff or land. Runway control may be returned to
     RSU control after all emergency response vehicles have crossed the affected runway or the
     emergency has been terminated.
     1.4.8. Establish procedures to resolve conflicts between tower-controlled aircraft and RSU-
     controlled aircraft that are overshooting the final turn.
     1.4.9. Establish procedures to ensure RSU-controlled traffic is separated from arriving and
     departing transient aircraft.
        1.4.9.1. (Added-12FTW) For civil aircraft in or near the Seguin AF Auxiliary pattern
        use caution to deconflict T-38s until the civil aircraft is clear of the pattern or lands.
        Immediately notify Base Operations if a civil aircraft lands. Record the registration
        number, color, and type of aircraft. If able to contact the pilot, request they complete DD
        Form 2402, Civil Aircraft Hold Harmless Agreement, including a brief statement on the
        reverse side describing why they landed. Forward this information to Base Operations.
        Do not allow the civilian aircraft to depart until released by Base Operations.
        1.4.9.2. (Added-12FTW) During helicopter operations at Seguin, advise the helicopter
        pilots of T-38 landing direction and winds.
     1.4.10. Establish procedures to relinquish RSU control of a runway to the tower when
     weather conditions prevent visual flight rules (VFR) traffic patterns.
     1.4.11. Establish procedures to use if RSU or control tower communications fail.
        1.4.11.1. (Added-12FTW) If the RSU encounters a power failure that degrades
        communication with airborne aircraft such that it is necessary to terminate pattern
        operations, the Seguin RSU crew will direct the red light prohibiting any runway
        operations by any aircraft in the pattern. In addition, Seguin will attempt contact with
        aircraft on the VHF portable radio and sequence departures. No touch-and-go will be
        allowed until normal RSU power and communications are restored.
        1.4.11.2. (Added-12FTW) The controller will remain in the RSU to prevent touch and
        go landings; the observer notifies the SOF via the RSU cellular phone or from the fire
        station telephone.
        1.4.11.3. (Added-12FTW) RSU crew will return to Randolph when directed by 560
        FTS Ops Sup as appropriate.
1.5. RSU Program Manager Responsibilities. The RSU program manager must be a current
RSU controller. The RSU program manager will:
     1.5.1. Maintain overall control of the RSU program and function as the OG/CC point of
     contact on RSU issues.
     1.5.2. Limit RCS maximum occupancy as follows:
        1.5.2.1. Inside a large (permanent) RCS at one time 10 individuals.
        1.5.2.2. Inside a small (mobile) RCS at one time six individuals.
AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010                                                             7


   1.5.3. Maintain a permanent visitor log or develop a process to verify that all orientation and
   required supervisory visits are accomplished.
   1.5.4. Ensure the controller is seated at the end of the RCS closest to the runway approach
   end and the observer is seated at the opposite end.
   1.5.5. Forward all open RCS discrepancies to the OG/CC each flying week.
   1.5.6. Observe Class A RSU operations at least once per quarter for a minimum of 1 hour.
   Visits will vary between each type of aircraft, document on AETC Form 1163, RCS/RSU
   Supervisor’s Critique.
   1.5.7. Review and provide AETC Forms 1163 to the respective T-6 or T-38 squadron
   commander (SQ/CC) and RSUTSO.
   1.5.8. Where appropriate, use operational risk management (ORM) principles in building
   necessary control measures into the RSU program. Examples of ORM include mitigating the
   risk in RSU operations relating to solo students, poor or adverse weather, or crowded
   patterns. These are all cases where risk analysis and elevating concerns to more experienced
   and qualified supervisors such as the TOP 3 or OG/CC may be required.
   1.5.9. Establish a currency requirement tracking system for all personnel in the RSU
   program.
1.6. RSU Training and Standardization Officer (RSUTSO) Responsibilities. The RSUTSO
must be a qualified instructor controller. Each RSUTSO will:

   publishing function that provides the same information, is used to document RCS
   discrepancies. Open AETC Form 360 write-ups must be accessible from the RCS.
   1.10.3. At the beginning of each flying week, notifies the RSU program manager of open
   AETC Form 360 write-ups.
   1.10.4. Maintains a file of completed AETC Forms 360, or equivalent electronic documents
   approved by the unit publishing manager, for each RCS. Retains the file for a minimum of 1
   year from the date corrective action is completed, or longer if required to adequately track
   trend items.
   1.10.5. Conducts a monthly inspection of RCS structure and component equipment, see
   Attachment 2 for the RCS checklist.
   1.10.6. Maintains a copy of the inspection results for 1 year.
   1.10.7. Maintains a permanent record for each RCS using AFTO IMT 95, Significant
   Historical Data. The AFTO IMT 95 contains major modifications or repairs to the structure
   and component equipment. (AFTO IMT 95 is prescribed by TO 00-20-1, Aerospace
   Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures. Refer to that
   publication for guidance on completing the form.) HQ AETC/A6OL must review and
   coordinate on requests for modification of communications equipment: Modifications will
   not be made to standard RCS design and equipment without the approval of HQ AETC/A3F
   and the HQ AETC/A7C.
1.11. T-1 RSU Monitor Program:
   1.11.1. The OG/CC may use T-1 aircrew in the RSU monitor program.
   1.11.2. The program may stand alone or be combined within an existing T-6 or T-38
   program, as follows:
       1.11.2.1. If the program stands alone, follow all provisions (RSUTO, RSUTSO, RSU
       meetings, etc.) and conduct all training according to this instruction. The RSUTSO and
       RSUTO will comply with all requirements in paragraphs 1.6 and 1.8, except they will
       maintain instructor monitor status.

     1.11.2.2. If the program is combined with another program, the T-1 SQ/CC appoints an
     instructor monitor as the T-1 monitor program RSUTO. The T-1 monitor program
     RSUTO is the focal point for all RSU issues in the T-1 squadron and works with host
     RSUTSOs and RSUTOs from the T-6 and T-38 squadrons to ensure the requirements of
     the RSUTO are met (see paragraphs 1.8 through 1.8.10).
  1.11.3. If T-1s are involved with the RSU monitor program, T-1 squadron commanders and
  operations officers (DO) will observe a Class B RSU once every 6 months.

 Notes:
 1. Does not preclude temporary control of the runway by the tower (that is, emergency
 vehicle crossings) as long as the RSU controller continues to control the traffic pattern as
 needed to comply with tower controlled runway requirements (that is, restricted low
 approach). Units are responsible for developing appropriate procedures.
 2. The OG/CC may waive RSU requirement after an appropriate risk assessment.
 3. T-38 supervised solo out-and-back and solo night navigation sorties may depart or return
 (one pattern to a full stop) under tower control as long as a Class B RSU is in place.
 4. Local T-38 solo student sorties may depart or return (one pattern to a full stop) under
 tower control as long as a Class B RSU is in place and a Class A RSU is open on the
 primary T-38 runway. (Exception: Solo student contact and/or transition sorties will return
 to an RSU controlled pattern.) Local T-6 solo student sorties may depart under tower
 control at the discretion of the OG/CC as long as a Class B RSU is in place and a Class A
 RSU is open on the T-6 runway.

 5. Randolph auxiliary airfield operations require a Class A RSU.
 6. T-38 supervised solo single-ship sorties: Before any students arriving, landing, or
 departing an out base, an assistant flight commander or above (if unavailable, a qualified
 RSU controller) will be in place at the approach end of the active runway or in the control
 tower. He or she will have the proper publications, act as the on-scene mission commander,
 and advise the air traffic controller in emergency situations. Personnel performing this duty
 must not interfere with control tower operations. On-scene commanders will ensure they
 have a VHF discreet frequency to communicate with the students. This requirement is
 waived if a Class A RSU and a SOF are in place at the out base and the on-scene
 commander has relayed the call signs of all aircraft in the deployment to the current SOF.
 7. T-38 Formation solo O&B sorties: Solo students are required to land before their
 formation flight lead that will serve as on-scene commander and advise ATC in emergency
 situations.
 8. Includes ENJJPT PIT and transition (trainee) syllabus sorties.
 9. Opening RSU crews will check the condition of the auxiliary field's runway by
 conducting a low approach before landing.

2.3. Supervisory Visits. The purpose of supervisory visits is to demonstrate full support for and
close supervision of the RSU program. Supervisors will monitor RSU crew performance, aircrew
compliance with traffic pattern procedures, and overall radio discipline. In addition, supervisors
will use the AETC Form 1163 to record their observations during each visit. Completing AETC
Form 1163 is mandatory. The RSUTSO reviews AETC Forms 1163 and sends them (as a
minimum) to the OGV program manager, facility manager (if facility related), and SQ/CC for
their review. The minimum frequency of supervisory visits is as follows:
      2.3.1. The OG/CC or OG/CD and the RSU program managers will observe Class A RSU
      operations at least once per quarter for a minimum of 1 hour. Visitation to each home and
      auxiliary field RSU is highly encouraged during each quarter.
AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010                                                           13


   2.3.2. T-6 and T-38 squadron commanders and operations officers will observe Class A
   RSU operations in their respective RSUs at least once per month CCs and DOs will alternate
   visits between the home and auxiliary field.
   2.3.3. The 560 FTS CC, DO, or ADO may alternate RSU visits, but each CC will ensure
   supervisory visitation occurs on a monthly basis. Flight CC participation is encouraged, but
   not required.
2.4. Equipment and Maintenance:
   2.4.1. RCSs are real property; base civil engineering units provide for their support and
   maintenance. HQ AETC/A6OL must review and coordinate all requests for modification of
   communications equipment.
   2.4.2. The RSU crews notify the appropriate agency of any maintenance discrepancy and
   obtain a job control number and an estimated completion time.
   2.4.2. (12FTW) The RSU controller is responsible for ensuring all discrepancies are entered
   on AETC Form 360, Runway Control Structure (RCS)/Runway Supervisory Unit (RSU)
   Discrepancy Log, that the appropriate RSUTSO is notified of the discrepancies, and the form
   is updated (signed off by the technician performing the repairs) if the discrepancies are
   corrected while on duty.
   2.4.3. For onsite repairs, the individual providing the repair completes the appropriate
   portions of AETC Form 360, showing actions taken and notifies the RCS facility officer. If
   the cause of the discrepancy cannot be determined, the repair person annotates in the
   corrective action block “could not duplicate,” and notifies the RCS facility officer. Note:
   Repeat intermittent operation write-ups with no determined cause will require a thorough
   inspection of affected system components.
   2.4.4. Maintenance personnel will document removal and replacement of RCS
   communications equipment on AETC Form 360 to include serial numbers, if applicable.
   2.4.5. The RCS facility officer or appointed alternate ensures RCS equipment is operational,
   as applicable. RCS equipment includes:
      2.4.5.1. Radios. Normal RCS radio configuration should consist of three radios (one
      single-channel primary frequency, one single-channel guard frequency, and one
      multifrequency). Radios must provide transmit, receive, and record capability. OG/CC
      may approve an RSU opening or remaining open with only two radios (one primary
      frequency and one guard frequency) only if both have transmit and receive capability.
      RSU may also remain open if the record capability is inoperable. Consider both situations
      a temporary configuration to allow operations while the inoperative radio is expeditiously
      repaired. Each RCS is equipped with an RSU upgrade position that overrides
      transmissions from the trainee’s position.
      2.4.5.2. Telephones. Each RCS should have a minimum of one Class C telephone line
      and two telephones. Note: OG/CC may approve temporary operations at the auxiliary
      field without this requirement provided an operable cellular telephone is available and the
      hotlines to crash and rescue, tower, and SOF are working. Consider this situation a
      temporary configuration while telephones are being repaired as quickly as possible.
14                                              AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010


     2.4.5.3. Hotlines. Note: OG/CC may approve temporary operations without these
     requirements provided an operable telephone is available. This should be considered a
     temporary configuration while hotlines are repaired as expeditiously as possible. Hotlines
     must be available and should have a recording capability to ensure direct contact with the
     following:
        2.4.5.3.1. Tower. Note: Auxiliary fields are exempt.
        2.4.5.3.2. Ground Control Approach. Note: Required for runways where precision
        approach radar or airport surveillance radar (ASR) approaches are flown (except
        emergency-only ASRs).
        2.4.5.3.3. SOF. Note: The tower and SOF may share the same line if the activities
        are collocated.
        2.4.5.3.4. Crash or Rescue. Crash or rescue at auxiliary fields.
        2.4.5.3.5. Other RCSs. Other RCSs serving parallel runways, as necessary.
        2.4.5.3.6. Other Agencies as Required. Note: A hotline is the preferred method for
        auxiliary field RCSs. However, “executive override” on an auxiliary field RCS Class
        C telephone may be used when hotline installation is not available.
     2.4.5.4. Flare Pistols (Optional). If flares are maintained and used, at least two flare
     pistols and six flare cartridges should be in place and operable at the start of flying.
     2.4.5.5. Light Gun. A light gun will be available in each RCS.
     2.4.5.6. Binoculars. Two sets of binoculars at home field and one set at the auxiliary
     field are required.
     2.4.5.7. Wind-Measuring Equipment. At the home field, a temporary operation
     without this equipment is acceptable when alternate procedures (such as a tower) are
     established to obtain accurate wind information. At the auxiliary field, a temporary
     operation without this equipment is acceptable with OG/CC approval after close scrutiny
     of current and forecasted weather and winds. In either case, consider this only a
     temporary configuration to allow operations while the equipment is expeditiously
     repaired.
     2.4.5.8. Portable Toilet Facilities. As required.
     2.4.5.9. Air-Conditioner and Heater. An air-conditioner and heater capable of
     maintaining temperatures within the RCS between 70 degrees and 75 degrees Fahrenheit
     are required.
     2.4.5.10. Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). An APU capable of supporting essential RCS
     equipment (including air-conditioner) during commercial power outages is required.
     (Exception: APUs are not required to be prepositioned at RCSs if the OG/CC and base
     civil engineer jointly concur that predicted reliability of commercial power is sufficient to
     satisfy RSU and divert requirements.) For RCSs with an APU requirement:
        2.4.5.10.1. RCS facility managers will ensure an automatic-start feature is available
        and enabled, if equipped.
AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010                                                                 15


           2.4.5.10.2. RSUTSOs will establish a training program with local power production
           personnel to ensure all controllers and observers are certified in APU operations.
           2.4.5.10.3. The OG/CC may approve continued RSU operations with an inoperable
           APU as long as commercial power is available. If commercial power is subsequently
           lost, the RSU crew notifies airborne aircrews that communication capability has been
           lost according to local guidance. The RSU crew must contact the appropriate agency
           to ensure the APU is repaired as quickly as possible.
       2.4.5.11. Dehumidifier. Install a dehumidifier in each RCS to ensure humidity levels
       remain acceptable for electronics equipment. (Exception: A dehumidifier is not required
       if the air conditioner is not turned off.) Note: Establish an outside drain for the
       dehumidifier since facilities are not always occupied.
   2.4.6. BAK-15 Aircraft Arresting System Components. Test the BAK-15 at the
   beginning of each flying week. With OG/CC approval, an RSU may open or remain open
   with an inoperable BAK-15 barrier. Consider this a temporary configuration to allow
   operation while the barrier is expeditiously repaired.
2.5. Handling and Storing Procedures for Flares and Flare Pistols. Maintenance and use of
flares is optional. If flares are maintained and used, units must comply with the following
requirements:
   2.5.1. Because flares and flare pistols are classified as munitions and firearms, RSU
   personnel handling them must apply the special security and storage procedures in AFMAN
   91-201, Explosive Safety Standards.
   2.5.2. RSU personnel who handle flares and flare pistols must complete initial and recurring
   training according to AFMAN 91-201. They must also comply with the following
   procedures:
       2.5.2.1. Load flare pistols only after they are installed in a flare port. Unload the pistol
       before removal from a flare port.
       2.5.2.2. If a dry firing check is required, install the flare pistol in the flare port before
       firing.
       2.5.2.3. Leave the breech open when the flare pistol is not secured in the flare port.
       2.5.2.4. If a flare fails to fire, make two more attempts. If the flare still fails to fire, use
       the other pistol. Wait at least 30 seconds after a misfire, then open the breech, unload the
       pistol, and examine the flare for primer indentation by the firing pin.
       2.5.2.5. If an indentation exists, reload the pistol with a new flare, place the misfired
       flare into a container marked “misfired flares,” and place the container outside the RCS.
       2.5.2.6. If no indentation exists, remove the pistol from service and have qualified
       personnel conduct an inspection of the pistol.
   2.5.3. Bases will establish local procedures for disposal of the misfired flares as well as

                                           Chapter 3

                          CREW QUALIFICATION AND DUTIES

3.1. Controller Qualification:
   3.1.1. The SQ/CC will select the minimum number of controllers necessary to satisfy
   mission requirements, attempting to ensure an overall balance between first assignment
   instructor pilots and major weapon system personnel.
   3.1.2. RSU controllers are selected from the most highly qualified, current instructor pilot
   (IP) with at least 6 months IP experience in current aircraft and a minimum of 90 days
   experience as an observer or monitor. Controller candidates, regardless of previous
   experience or qualification, will complete the initial qualification controller syllabus outlined
   in Attachment 3. Proficiency advancement is authorized at the discretion of the OG/CC.
   3.1.3. The initial qualification evaluation should include all aspects of a normally scheduled
   RSU tour (crew brief, control of overhead traffic, debrief, etc). The tour length will be an
   entire scheduled tour. Periodic evaluations should be planned for 2 hours minimum.
   3.1.4. Before controlling traffic at night, a minimum of 1 night on-the-job-training (OJT)
   tour with a minimum length of 2 hours is required. If the night tour is not accomplished, the
   Letter of Xs will reflect a day-only qualification.
   3.1.5. After completion of the initial evaluation, but before performing unsupervised
   controller duties, the OG/CC must interview the candidate and sign the AETC Form 309. The
   SQ/CC ensures the Letter of Xs is updated to reflect this certification. Currency requirements
   and the evaluation zone are based on the day and month of the evaluation. Subsequent AETC
   Forms 309 are reviewed and signed by the OG/CC.
   3.1.6. Before performing aircraft handling characteristics/emergency landing pattern
   (AHC/ELP) controller duties, RSU controllers will accomplish all qualification requirements
   established in Attachment 3.
   3.1.7. If a controller fails the initial or periodic evaluation, the evaluator documents the
   results on the AETC Form 309. The RSUTSO or RSUTO consults with the individual’s
   SQ/CC to determine whether to retrain or withdraw the controller from the program. If
   training is continued, the controller completes the recommended retraining and accomplishes
   the evaluation. Note: Current controllers who were RSU instructors (observer or monitor)
   before controller upgrade may perform instructor monitor or instructor observer duties. All
   night RSU operations require a controller to have a night qualification.
3.2. Instructor Controller Qualification. The SQ/CC will designate the minimum number of
controllers necessary to perform instructor controller duties. Candidates must have 6 months of
current controller experience or have accomplished 20 tours. Before performing instructor
controller duties, trainees will receive an instructor controller briefing from the RSUTSO. The
RSUTO can give this briefing if the RSUTSO is not available (leave, temporary duty [TDY],
etc.). Instructor controllers will be tracked on the Letter of Xs.
AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010                                                              17


3.3. Controller Duties. The RSU controller is responsible for the safe and efficient control of
all aircraft under the RSU’s jurisdiction, including air discipline, pattern conformity, and
compliance with established procedures. However, he or she is not responsible for individual
aircrew training requirements. The RSU controller will:
   3.3.1. Use preventive control procedures to ensure flight safety within the RSU pattern.
   3.3.2. Resolve pattern conflicts, using whatever means necessary (to include plain English).
   3.3.3. Issue traffic priority to emergency and minimum fuel aircraft.
   3.3.4. Positively identify solos, particularly Commander’s Awareness Program solos, at all
   times and issues traffic priority as the situation dictates.
   3.3.5. Brief the observer, spotter, and recorder on their duties before each tour.
   3.3.6. Focus attention on the lowest, slowest airborne aircraft within his or her primary area
   of responsibility (AOR). The controller is responsible for the entire pattern. However, his or
   her primary AOR should emphasize that part of the traffic pattern from:
       3.3.6.1. Initial to overhead the RCS.
       3.3.6.2. Closed downwind abeam the RCS to the perch (high key or base key).
       3.3.6.3. The final turn through the final approach and touchdown zone.
   3.3.7. Verbalize handoffs of overheads, long landings, and go-arounds. Note: Verbal
   handoffs are designed to prevent unnecessary overlap between AORs. Controllers may need
   to glance into the observer’s AOR for situational awareness, but should not use this
   technique repeatedly as a substitute for good cockpit/crew resource management (CRM).
   3.3.8. Ensure proper use of AETC Form 355 or equivalent product approved by their unit
   publishing manager, to record takeoff and landing times and pattern comments.
   3.3.9. Initiate a preliminary communications search when a single-ship local T-38 student
   solo sortie is airborne for 1 hour, increase this time to 1+20 for other T-38 sorties, 1+20 for
   T-6 student solo sorties, 1+45 for other T-6 sorties, and 3+10 for T-1A sorties. Notify the
   SOF if the preliminary communications search is unsuccessful.
   3.3.10. Advise the SOF if weather observed is incompatible with the current flying status. In
   coordination with the SOF, take immediate action when unforecasted weather dictates.
   3.3.11. Announce landing direction, pattern status, wake turbulence advisories, pattern
   trends, and winds as appropriate, to facilitate safe and efficient pattern operations.
   3.3.12. Announce bird condition, advisories on the location and flight path of any large
   influx of birds in the vicinity of the airfield, activities of other aircraft that may affect the
   traffic pattern, and other conditions, as appropriate, that may affect safety of operations.
   3.3.13. Ensure aircraft-arresting barriers are operational and in the proper position before
   clearing aircraft for takeoff or landing.
   3.3.14. Ensure aircraft are visually checked for proper configuration before takeoff or
   landing.
   3.3.15. Report deviations from established procedures to the appropriate squadron
   supervisor.

   3.3.16. Not attempt to maintain the normal volume and pace of pattern operations when
   emergency situations arise. To maintain situational awareness on the emergency aircraft, the
   RCS controller will:
       3.3.16.1. Consider using any combination of the following: stop launch, stop pattern
       entries, restricted low approach, straight through initial, etc.
       3.3.16.2. Time permitting, review emergency procedures with the aircraft and coordinate
       actions with the SOF.
       3.3.16.3. Designate an aircraft with an instructor onboard to fly as chase when an
       emergency aircraft in the VFR pattern requires airborne assistance.
   3.3.17. Notify base operations if an aircraft disturbs the down barrier in the approach end
   overrun.
   3.3.17. (12FTW) Seguin RSU controllers notify Seguin Crash if they suspect either barrier
   has been disturbed.
   3.3.18. Not permit other duties (upgrades, telephone calls, facility maintenance, etc.) to
   distract attention from his or her primary controller responsibilities.
   3.3.19. (Added-12FTW) Ensure the SOFs and Duty Officers are notified of any significant
   bird or bat activity. Make appropriate bird watch condition recommendations.
   3.3.20. (Added-12FTW) Terminate all RSU pattern operations when communications with
   Randolph (telephone and UHF/VHF radio) are lost.
   3.3.21. (Added-12FTW) Ensure aircraft do not enter the pattern, land, or takeoff prior to
   official sunrise or after official sunset.
   3.3.22. (Added-12FTW) Ensure military aircraft do not perform ELPs, overhead breaks,
   closed patterns, or straight-in approaches in the event of an accident or incident requiring
   crash/rescue until normal crash/rescue facilities have recovered to an operationally ready
   posture.
   3.3.23. (Added-12FTW) Notify the appropriate SOF of an aircraft accident or an
   emergency full stop landing.
   3.3.24. (Added-12FTW) Aircraft Recall. RSU controllers will relay the SOF's aircraft
   recall to aircraft under their control and aid the SOF in aircraft accountability/recovery.
3.4. Monitor Qualification. The SQ/CC selects the minimum number of monitors necessary to
satisfy mission requirements. Monitors are selected from the most highly qualified and current
IPs with at least 3 months of IP experience accumulated during their current duty assignment. On
completion of training, the RSUTSO must ensure all training is accomplished before the
trainee’s perform monitor duties.
   3.4.1. The Letter of Xs must be updated to reflect monitor qualification.
   3.4.2. Currency requirements begin on the day of the last upgrade tour.
   3.4.3. Monitors performing duties at night must accomplish one 2-hour night OJT tour under
   the supervision of a night-qualified controller or night-qualified upgrade monitor. If the night
   tour is not accomplished, the Letter of Xs must reflect a day-only qualification.
AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010                                                             19


3.5. Instructor Monitor Qualification. The SQ/CC will designate the minimum number of
monitors necessary to perform instructor monitor duties. Trainees must have 3 months of current
monitor experience or have accomplished 10 tours. Before performing instructor monitor duties,
trainees will receive an instructor monitor briefing from the RSUTSO. The RSUTO can give this
briefing if the RSUTSO is not available (leave, TDY, etc.). Instructor monitors will be tracked
on the Letter of Xs.
3.6. Monitor Duties. Each monitor will:
   3.6.1. Transmit proper instructions to prevent potentially hazardous situations during takeoff
   and landing.
   3.6.2. Ensure all aircraft are visually checked for proper configuration before takeoff or
   landing.
   3.6.3. Focus attention on the lowest, slowest airborne aircraft.
   3.6.4. Advise the SOF if observed weather is incompatible with current flying status.
   3.6.5. Report deviations from established procedures to the appropriate squadron supervisor.
   3.6.6. Use AETC Form 355 or equivalent, approved by the unit publishing manager, to
   record takeoff and landing times.
   3.6.7. Initiate a preliminary communications search when a single-ship local student solo
   sortie is airborne for 1 hour, increase this time to 1+20 for other T-38 sorties, 1+45 for other
   T-6 sorties, and 3+10 for other T-1A sorties; and notify the SOF if the preliminary
   communications search is unsuccessful.
   3.6.8. Notify base operations if an aircraft disturbs the down barrier in the approach end
   overrun.
   3.6.9. Does not permit other duties (upgrades, telephone calls, facility maintenance, etc.) to
   distract his or her attention from primary monitor responsibilities. Note: Monitors, qualified
   in one type of aircraft, may monitor initial takeoffs, touch-and-go landings, and full-stop
   landings performed by another type aircraft (see Table 2.2.). In addition, monitors who
   transitioned directly from the observer position may perform observer duties if they maintain
   required observer currency requirements.
3.7. Observer Qualification:
   3.7.1. The SQ/CC selects the minimum number of observers necessary to satisfy mission
   requirements.
   3.7.2. RSU observers are selected from the most highly qualified and current IPs with at
   least 3 months of IP experience in their assigned aircraft accumulated during their current
   duty assignment.
       3.7.2.1. Observer trainees in the 560 FTS must be rated pilots current and qualified in the
       aircraft being observed.
       3.7.2.2. Observer trainees in ENJPPT must have at least 1 month of experience as an IP
       during their current tour.

   3.7.3. The RSUTSO must ensure all training is accomplished before the trainee performs
   observer duties. Observers performing duties at night will accomplish one 2-hour night OJT
   tour under the supervision of a night-qualified controller or night-qualified upgrade observer.
   If the night tour is not accomplished, the Letter of Xs must reflect a day-only qualification.
   Currency requirements will begin on the day of the last upgrade tour.
3.8. Instructor Observer Qualification. The SQ/CC will designate (in writing) the minimum
number of observers necessary to perform instructor observer duties. Instructor observer
qualification memorandums, signed by the squadron commander, will be maintained in each
individual’s training folder. Instructor observers must have 3 months of current observer
experience or have accomplished 10 tours. Before performing instructor observer duties,
instructor observers will receive a briefing from the RSUTSO. The RSUTO can give this
briefing if the RSUTSO is not available (leave, TDY, etc.). Instructor observers will be tracked
on the Letter of Xs.
3.9. Observer Duties. The observer is responsible for compliance with the requirements
established by the controller during the briefing, but he or she is not responsible for individual
aircrew training requirements. The observer will:
   3.9.1. Focus attention on the lowest, slowest airborne aircraft within his or her AOR. Note:
   The observer’s primary AOR is defined as that part of the traffic pattern from the end of the
   touchdown zone through the first turn out of traffic, aircraft carrying straight through initial,
   aircraft in the break, and closed patterns upwind of the RCS.
   3.9.2. Acknowledge handoffs of overheads, go-arounds, and long landings. Note: Verbal
   handoffs are designed to prevent unnecessary overlap between AORs. Observers may need to
   glance into the controller’s AOR for situational awareness, but should not use this technique
   repeatedly as a substitute for good CRM.
   3.9.3. Inform the controller when aircraft commence the break and when departure leg or
   offset turn crosswind.
   3.9.4. Build a verbal picture for the controller of his or her AOR and suggest a course of
   action. When time constraints prevent building a verbal picture, the observer will not hesitate
   to use the radio to prevent a conflict from developing or to ensure safety of flight.
   3.9.5. Closely monitor the departure roll, departure leg, and landing.
   3.9.6. Coordinate terminology for “spacing” requests during the crew briefing.
   3.9.7. Notify the controller of deviations from established pattern procedures.
3.10. Spotter Qualification and Duties. The spotter must be an IP, a recent UFT graduate, or a
post-solo UFT student undergoing training in the aircraft being controlled. He or she will:
   3.10.1. Comply with the requirements established by the controller during the briefing.
   3.10.2. Check aircraft for proper configuration before takeoff and landing and immediately
   notify the controller of irregularities.
   3.10.3. Monitor aircraft in final turn and inform the controller of deviations (overshoots,
   higher or lower than normal final turns, configuration inconsistencies, etc).

      4.2.1.6. Receive an oral evaluation administered by the RSUTSO or RSUTO, covering
      monitor responsibilities. The RSUTSO or RSUTO, as appropriate, signs the AETC Form
      309 following the completion of the evaluation.
   4.2.2. Documentation of Training. Document the completion of training on AETC Form
   309. The Letter of Xs reflects this qualification. Currency requirements begin on completion
   of the last OJT tour. Any loss of currency must be documented in the individual training
   record. The folder is given to the individual upon his or her removal from monitor duties or a
   change of station.
   4.2.3. Requalification Training:
      4.2.3.1. The OG/CC determines the requirements for monitor requalification training. As
      a minimum, the training must include a review of all RSU directives, a 25-question,
      written test, and one 1-hour OJT tour with an instructor monitor or instructor controller.
      4.2.3.2. A current controller may perform instructor monitor duties, but he or she will not

   4.3.2. Documentation of Training. Completion of training will be documented on AETC
   Form 309. Currency requirements begin on completion of the last OJT tour. Document any
   loss of currency in the individual training record. Provide the folder to the individual upon
   his or her removal from observer duties or a change of station.
   4.3.3. Requalification Training:
       4.3.3.1. The OG/CC will determine requirements for observer requalification training.
       As a minimum, the training must include a review of all RSU directives, a 25-question
       written test, and a 1-hour OJT tour with an instructor observer.
       4.3.3.2. A current controller may perform instructor observer duties, but he or she will
       not simultaneously control traffic and conduct observer upgrade training.
       4.3.3.3. Night requalification requires an additional 2-hour night tour.
4.4. Training Documentation. Each RSUTO must maintain a training record for each
controller, monitor, and observer trainee. The RSUTO maintains the folder as long as the
individual is an active controller, monitor, or observer and sends it with the individual when he
or she transfers intracommand. The record contents include:
   4.4.1. AETC Form 393, RCS/RSU Controller Record of Training. Use AETC Form 393
   to record items accomplished during OJT tours. Add items and procedures peculiar to the
   local area to the bottom or back of the form or to a supplemental sheet.
   4.4.2. AF IMT 4293, Student Activity Record. Use AF IMT 4293 to record comments on
   the trainee’s progress after each OJT tour. As a minimum, comments must address unusual
   occurrences, strengths and weaknesses, and any applicable restrictions. A locally produced
   form may be used in place of the AF IMT 4293, if approved by HQ AETC/A3FV and the
   unit publishing function.
   4.4.3. AETC Form 309. Use the AETC Form 309 to document evaluation performance.
   Rate each performance as “qualified” or “unqualified.” Use AETC Form 309 to document
   outstanding performances. The Letter of Xs reflects qualification.
   4.4.4. Statement of Requalification. Use a statement of requalification for each episode of

                                          Chapter 5

                 CURRENCY REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS

5.1. Currency Documentation. The RSU program manager will establish a currency
requirement tracking system for all personnel in the RSU program. This system should allow for
easy review of data relating to the number of tours accomplished, duration, dates of tour, etc.
Note: When accomplishing recurrency or requalification tours, both the instructor and trainee
must log the tour in order to verify proper completion of requalification training.
5.2. Flight Currency, Medical, and Crew Duty Day Restrictions:
   5.2.1. If an individual is grounded for an extended period, the OG/CC may waive aircraft
   qualification and currency requirements for the purpose of RSU controller, monitor, or
   observer duty. File the waiver in the individual’s training folder. During the waiver period,
   the individual will satisfy all RSU duty prerequisites (go/no-go items, RSU meeting
   attendance, etc.) and currencies.
   5.2.2. RSU crewmembers who are medically excused from flying duty or grounded may not
   perform RSU duty without specific written clearance from the flight surgeon.
   5.2.3. RSU crewmembers are not permitted to perform RSU duty if such duty will extend
   their crew duty period beyond 12 hours. Note: RSU duty is a flying-related activity and must
   be considered when scheduling instructors and students (for student night flying operations,
   etc.).
5.3. Controller Currency:
   5.3.1. To satisfy minimum currency requirements, controllers will perform Class A RSU
   duties for at least 1 hour every 30-calendar days (45 days for the 12 FTW). A full-length,
   regularly scheduled tour is the preferred method for updating controller currency. A
   controller performing instructor duties may log a tour to meet this requirement. Note: Initial
   currency is based on the date of the initial evaluation, not the date the OG/CC signs the
   AETC Form 309.
   5.3.2. If 30 days pass without performing controller duties (45 days for the 12 FTW), the
   controller must undergo refresher training to include a review of applicable RSU publications
   and a 1-hour OJT tour under the supervision of a current instructor controller. Document the
   loss of currency and recurrency in the individual’s training record.
   5.3.3. If 60 days pass without performing controller duties, the controller must undergo
   refresher training of at least two 2-hour tours under the supervision of an instructor
   controller. In addition, the controller must accomplish a written examination. The OG/CC
   may waive any part of this requirement. Document the loss of currency and recurrency in the
   individual’s training record.
   5.3.4. If more than 90 days pass without performing controller duties, the controller must
   complete nonwaiverable requalification training (see paragraph 4.1.2). Base the periodic
   evaluation zone on the new qualification date. Indicate the reason for requalification on
   AETC Form 309.

   5.3.5. The SQ/CC must review each instance of lost currency and ensure the review is
   documented in the individual’s training record.
   5.3.6. The OG/CC must review the training record and circumstances for an individual who
   exceeds 90-day currency to determine his or her suitability to remain in the RSU program.
   Document the review in the individual’s training record.
5.4. Monitor Currency:
   5.4.1. To satisfy minimum currency requirements, each monitor must perform RSU duty at
   least once every 45 days. A monitor performing instructor duties may log a tour to meet this
   requirement. A monitor may hold dual qualification as an observer as long as he or she
   maintains currency requirements in both positions. That is, monitor duty does not satisfy
   observer currency requirements or the reverse.
   5.4.2. If 45 days pass without performing monitor duties, the monitor must undergo refresher
   training to include a review of applicable RSU publications, and a 1-hour OJT tour under the
   supervision of a current instructor controller or instructor monitor. Note: Controllers may
   perform instructor monitor duties, but they will not simultaneously control traffic and
   conduct monitor upgrade training.
   5.4.3. If more than 60 days pass without performing monitor duties, the monitor must
   complete refresher training to include a 1-hour requalification tour, an oral evaluation, and a
   written examination.
   5.4.4. The SQ/CC must review each instance of lost currency. Document the review in the
   individual’s training record.
5.5. Observer Currency:
   5.5.1. To satisfy minimum currency requirements, each observer must perform RSU duty at
   least once every 45 days. An observer performing instructor duties may log a tour to meet
   this requirement. An observer may hold dual qualification as a monitor as long as he or she
   maintains currency requirements in both positions. That is, observer duty does not satisfy
   monitor currency requirements or the reverse.
   5.5.2. If 45 days pass without performing observer duties, the observer must undergo
   refresher training to include a review of applicable RSU publications and a 1-hour OJT tour
   under the supervision of a current instructor controller or instructor observer. Note:
   Controllers may perform instructor observer duties, but they will not simultaneously control
   traffic and conduct observer upgrade training.
   5.5.3. If more than 60 days pass without performing observer duties, the observer must
   complete refresher training to include a 1-hour requalification tour, an oral evaluation, and a
   written examination.
   5.5.4. The SQ/CC must review each instance of lost currency. Document the review in the
   individual’s training record.
5.6. Quarterly RSU Standardization Meeting:
   5.6.1. Conduct quarterly RSU standardization meetings at a time and place that will ensure
   maximum attendance. As a minimum, include an emergency scenario, trends, and current
   issues. Discussion of how solos may complicate the scenario is recommended.
AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010                                                            27


   5.6.2. Mandatory attendees include all RSU-qualified IP crewmembers, the OG/CC or
   OG/CD, the respective SQ/CC or DO, and the OGV program manager. Develop a process to
   ensure RSU crewmembers not in attendance read and initial the meeting minutes before their
   next RSU tour. Valid reasons for absence are TDY, authorized leave, duty not including
   flying to quarters, and reservists not available for duty. Exception: Randolph PIT trainees
   are not required to attend. However, meeting minutes must clearly communicate all pertinent
   aspects of the meeting, particularly emergency procedure discussions and resolutions.
5.7. Controller Performance Evaluations:
   5.7.1. Establish the evaluation zone from the 12th through the 17th month from the initial or
   previous evaluation. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to perform controller duties
   and as well as a full knowledge of applicable directives, aircraft performance characteristics,
   operating limitations, emergency procedures, and APU procedures (if applicable).
   5.7.2. Document the evaluation performance on the AETC Form 309 and route through the
   OG/CC for signature. Initial and periodic performance evaluation prerequisites are an oral
   evaluation; a 25-question, written test based on controller responsibilities; and a review of
   appropriate RSU directives.
5.8. Controller No-Notice Evaluations:
   5.8.1. Each RSUTSO and RSUTO will conduct no-notice evaluations. The no-notice
   program has three parts: (1) follow-up monitoring of individuals with previously identified
   deficiencies, (2) evaluations associated with local unit evaluations, and (3) random sampling
   of the assigned RSU crew force (quality of force). The no-notice program will include
   sufficient controller evaluations to ensure quality of force is maintained.
   5.8.2. No-notice evaluations should not be used as a scheduling tool to satisfy periodic
   evaluation requirements. Administered correctly, no-notice evaluations may count for the
   periodic evaluation if all other evaluation requirements are completed within 30 calendar
   days of the evaluation.
   5.8.3. The new evaluation zone is based on the date of the no-notice evaluation.

                                           Chapter 6

                            TRAFFIC PATTERN OPERATIONS

6.1. Conduct of Operations: Note: When established within Class C airspace, conduct RSU
patterns within practice areas as defined in local operating agreements. Participating local
aircraft in the practice areas are exempt from Class C services and will instead operate according
to local guidelines.
   6.1.1. RSU patterns exist to facilitate safe and efficient VFR traffic pattern operations. RSU
   personnel will use preventive control procedures to ensure flight safety within the RSU
   pattern, but are not responsible for individual aircrew training requirements. The following
   are examples of preventive control:
       6.1.1.1. Denying closed requests with aircraft on initial takeoff.
       6.1.1.2. Denying closed requests with straight-in traffic between 9 and 4 miles from
       touchdown (5 and 2 miles for T-6s).
       6.1.1.3. Denying late closed requests.
       6.1.1.4. Denying straight-in requests or clearance.
       6.1.1.5. Preventing aircraft from initiating the break with straight-in traffic between 9
       and 4 miles from touchdown (5 and 2 miles for T-6s).
   6.1.2. Under most circumstances, preventive control and standard RSU radio terminology
   (see Attachment 4) should be adequate to safely control the pattern. However, improper
   actions by aircrew or RSU personnel do occur and may sometimes lead to pattern conflicts.
   In these situations, RSU personnel must intervene immediately, using whatever means
   necessary (including “plain English”) to resolve the conflict. The following transmissions are
   examples of what may be necessary to resolve conflicts in the RSU pattern:
6.2. Aircraft Control:
   6.2.1. RSUs will control aircraft according to procedures in this chapter.
   6.2.2. Local aircraft under tower control and transient aircraft will be controlled according to
   applicable Air Force and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control publications.
   Note: Controllers must be aware that wind gust reporting procedures and reduced same
   runway separation rules are two areas in which tower operations differ considerably from
   RSU procedures.
   6.2.3. RSU controllers will not clear an aircraft for a low approach (less than 500 feet above
   ground level [AGL]) directly over a transient aircraft on landing roll or taxiing on the
   runway. Aircraft shall not be cleared for a low approach or restricted low approach directly
   over a transient aircraft that is in position and hold or departing.
   6.2.4. RSU controllers will not authorize a landing aircraft to cross the threshold until a
   preceding transient aircraft clears the runway. With tower approval, RSRS may be applied
   between home station and non-home station AETC trainer type aircraft according to
   paragraph 1.4.9 and Attachment 5. In this instance, tower retains separation responsibility
AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010                                                               29


   and shall issue go around instructions to the trailing aircraft (including RSU controlled) as
   required.
   6.2.5. RSU crews will maintain a separate traffic count for each Class A RSU-controlled
   runway. Count one movement for each takeoff or landing. Count a touch-and-go landing or
   low approach as two events. Count all aircraft in formation as one aircraft.
   6.2.6. RSU crews will use AETC Form 355 or equivalent, approved by the unit publishing
   manager, to record flight-following information, documentation of upgrade tours, recurrency
   and requalification, time in and time out of the facility, and comments on individual aircrew
   performance. Maintain AETC Form 355 or equivalent for 1 year. When documenting
   recurrency or requalification tours on AETC Form 355 or equivalent, both the instructor and
   trainee must log the tour in order to verify training.
6.3. Procedures at UFT and PIT Bases:
   6.3.1. Each base will establish procedures to provide positive separation between RSU-
   controlled traffic and transient aircraft under tower or approach control. Publish guidance
   according to AFI 33-360.
   6.3.2. Air traffic facilities will coordinate radar approaches to RSU-controlled runways as
   follows: (Note: The request-and-acknowledge system at Sheppard AFB satisfies the
   communications requirement of this paragraph.)
      6.3.2.1. Do not integrate approaches under tower and radar control with RSU-controlled
      traffic unless direct communication is established between the RSU, tower, and radar
      facility.
      6.3.2.2. To ensure proper sequencing of arriving radar traffic with RSU-controlled
      traffic, radar and RSU controllers will coordinate as follows:
          6.3.2.2.1. At a specified position, the radar controller establishes initial contact with
          the RSU and provides identification, position, and type of approach of the aircraft
          under radar control. The RSU is told when the aircraft is 9 miles from touchdown (5
          miles for T-6s). The RSU is also told when the aircraft is 4 miles from touchdown (2
          miles for T-6s).
          6.3.2.2.2. The RSU acknowledges each position report and issues appropriate traffic
          advisories and field information. In no case will a radar approach be continued closer
          than 3 miles from touchdown unless coordinated with the RSU controller.
          6.3.2.2.3. During T-38 night straight-in approaches, only one coordination call from
          the tower or radar to the RSU is required. This call must be made no closer than 5
          miles from touchdown and must include the frequency assigned to the aircraft nearest
          touchdown.
   6.3.3. Straight-in aircraft will report 9 and 4 miles from touchdown (5 and 2 miles for T-6s).
   RSU controllers will clear aircraft requesting a straight-in not later than when the aircraft is 9
   miles from touchdown (5 miles for T-6s). RSU crews will only allow aircraft to commence
   the break or depart high key with straight-in traffic between 9 and 4 miles (5 and 2 miles for
   T-6s) to facilitate pattern breakout training (pattern status allowing). Aircrews will not
   commence the final or base turn if closed or low key traffic was approved with an aircraft
30                                              AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010


  between 9 and 4 miles (5 and 2 miles for T-6s). Units will establish local procedures to
  accommodate cancellation of a straight-in clearance.
     6.3.3.1. To facilitate pattern breakout training where the emergency landing pattern
     (ELP) is flown opposite direction to the overhead pattern, RSU crews may clear aircraft
     to break.
     6.3.3.2. Aircrews will not commence the final turn if clearance was given with an
     aircraft between report high key and low key.
  6.3.4. RSU controllers must evaluate each minimum fuel situation in light of existing
  conditions and determine the extent to which aircraft are given special handling. When a
  pilot declares minimum fuel, other approaches and landings may continue. However; if a
  traffic conflict exists or is anticipated, minimum fuel aircraft must be given landing priority.
  RSU controllers will acknowledge the initial minimum fuel call.
  6.3.5. On arrival in the pattern, emergency aircraft will be given traffic priority. When
  emergency situations arise, controllers will not attempt to maintain the normal volume and
  pace of pattern operations. To maintain situational awareness on the emergency aircraft,
  consider any combination of the following: stop launch, restricted low approach, and straight
  through initial. Time permitting, review emergency procedures with the aircraft and
  coordinate actions with the SOF.
  6.3.6. When an emergency aircraft in the VFR pattern requires airborne assistance, designate
  an aircraft with an instructor on board to fly as chase. When an aircraft is disabled on or near
  a runway, discontinue normal traffic pattern operations. Controllers will base subsequent
  control decisions on the status of the distressed aircraft. Chiefs of airfield management or
  their representatives are responsible for authorizing resumption of normal runway operations.
  6.3.7. Control formations as a unit. However, after formation aircraft have split up,
  controllers may apply RSRS criteria.
  6.3.8. Procedures for RSU takeoff clearance are as follows:
     6.3.8.1. Do not allow more than four aircraft on the runway in takeoff position at the
     same time. At night, do not allow more than one aircraft (or one element of two aircraft)
     on the runway at one time.
     6.3.8.2. RSU controllers may authorize aircraft to taxi into position and hold when
     takeoff clearance cannot be issued because of other traffic.
     6.3.8.3. RSU controllers may authorize aircraft to taxi into takeoff position and hold
     when restricted low approach traffic is on final. Controllers will not clear aircraft for
     takeoff until proper separation is ensured with restricted low approach aircraft.
  6.3.9. Accomplish departure and arrival separation as specified in Attachment 5.
  6.3.10. Procedures for anticipating separation are as follows:
     6.3.10.1. Takeoff or landing clearance need not be withheld until prescribed separation
     exists if there is reasonable assurance that required separation will exist when the aircraft
     starts a takeoff roll or crosses the landing threshold. Landing clearance may be issued to a
     radar-controlled aircraft when the aircraft is 3 miles from touchdown even though a
     preceding aircraft has not crossed the landing threshold if there is reasonable assurance
AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010                                                            31


     that prescribed separation will exist when the radar-controlled aircraft crosses the
     threshold.
     6.3.10.2. The RSU controller may not issue a clearance that requires a provisional or
     conditional phrase. Specific guidance, such as “abort” or “go-around,” should be used.
     (See Attachment 4 for standard RSU phraseology.)
  6.3.11. Do not allow instrument and straight-in approaches to proceed inside 4 miles (2
  miles for T-6s) from the time a four-ship formation pitches until number four has initiated the
  turn to final.
  6.3.12. Closed traffic procedures are as follows:
     6.3.12.1. Aircraft will not normally be cleared for closed traffic or low key with another
     aircraft on initial before the break, with straight-in traffic between 9 and 4 miles (5 and 2
     miles for T-6s), or with an aircraft between initial and halfway between high key and low
     key. Note: An aircraft may be cleared for closed traffic or low key if the aircraft at high
     key is orbiting.
         6.3.12.1.1. To facilitate pattern breakout training where the ELP pattern is flown
         opposite direction to the overhead pattern, aircraft may request and be cleared for
         closed traffic with straight-in traffic between 9 and 4 miles (5 and 2 miles for T-6s),
         and with an aircraft between initial and halfway between high key and low key.
         6.3.12.1.2. The words “for practice breakout” will be added to the end of the request
         for closed, the closed approved, and closed downwind radio calls. If a closed pattern
         was approved under these conditions, the aircrew will not commence the final turn.
     6.3.12.2. Caution must be used when clearing closed traffic with two aircraft on
     departure leg. If there is a question as to which aircraft has requested a closed, the
     controller will not issue a clearance until the question is resolved.
  6.3.13. Aircraft will not be cleared for an ELP with an aircraft in the high pattern.
  6.3.14. When the aircrew reports or the controller directs a low approach, the aircraft will
  not touch down. During local flying operations when the aircrew is directed to make a
  restricted low approach, the aircraft will descend no lower than 500 feet AGL. (The
  controller may specify higher.) Aircraft making a restricted low approach with an aircraft in
  takeoff position must clear the runway, safety of flight permitting.
  6.3.15. The RSU controller’s silence to the pilot’s “gear down” call is an implied clearance
  to land, which may be modified by oral communications.
  6.3.16. RSU controllers will refrain from soliciting early turnoffs or instructing aircrews to
  clear the runway faster than normal.
  6.3.17. RSU controllers may request T-6 aircrews to turn off strobe lights during hours of
  darkness while in the home-base traffic pattern.

                                              Chapter 7

                                 LOCAL AREA PROCEDURES

7.1. Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS). The airfield operations flight commander
provides TERPS service according to AFMAN 11-226, United States Standard for Terminal
Instrument Procedures (TERPS), and AFI 11-230, Instrument Procedures, for any procedure
designed for instrument approach or departure of aircraft; that is, nonprecision and precision
approaches and standard instrument departures.
7.2. Aircraft Traffic Patterns. Attachment 6 of this publication establishes home and auxiliary
field traffic patterns for T-1, T-6, and T-38 aircraft. In addition, the following rules apply to these
aircraft:
   7.2.1. Aircraft departing under RSU control must remain in visual meteorological conditions
   until the departure control facility establishes radio and radar contact with the aircraft.
   Military assumes responsibility for separation of aircraft (MARSA) will apply until standard
   instrument flight rules (IFR) separation is established. Each base will also designate points at
   which aircraft normally terminate IFR service on arrival.
   7.2.2. Aircraft of like type in the terminal area (not under radar or tower control) must
   maintain a specified airspeed on designated ground tracks and adhere to established altitudes.
   7.2.3. The number of aircraft in the VFR traffic pattern is limited to 12 T-6s, 12 T-38s, or 10
   T-1s. The night VFR traffic pattern for each aircraft is limited to 8 aircraft.
   7.2.4. UFT aircraft may remain in formation in the traffic pattern unless the RSU controller
   or tower directs otherwise.
   7.2.5. A common initial with opposite direction breaks for single runway operations will not
   be established. (Auxiliary fields are exempt.)
   7.2.6. When weather prevents the use of established pattern breakout procedures, a restricted
   pattern may be flown if the following requirements are satisfied:
       7.2.6.1. The existing ceiling is at least 500 feet above pattern altitude.
       7.2.6.2. Pattern is entered only:
           7.2.6.2.1. From initial takeoff.
           7.2.6.2.2. Via a crosswind entry or closed from a parallel runway.
           7.2.6.2.3. From a straight-in approach (if procedures are established to prevent a
           traffic conflict).
       7.2.6.3. Traffic pattern is limited to eight aircraft.
       7.2.6.4. Solo student sorties are prohibited.
   7.2.7. Night overhead and visual straight-in approaches will not be flown simultaneously to
   the same runway. Note: Randolph AFB is exempt.

       SYLLABUS REQUIREMENTS FOR RSU CONTROLLER CANDIDATES

A3.1. Training Requirements. The following minimum requirements will be included in the
local syllabus of instruction to upgrade RSU controller candidates: (Note: Additional training
(AT) or procedures peculiar to the local area will be added as necessary.)
   A3.1.1. Trainees must complete a minimum of nine daylight OJT tours within 45 calendar
   days. (Exception: 560 FTS controllers only require 5 daylight OJT tours within 45 calendar
   days. OG/CC may waive this requirement to a minimum of three tours.) The objective is to
   schedule tours to ensure continuity of training. Trainees who do not complete the training
   within 45 days are reviewed by the SQ/CC, who determines their suitability for continued
   training. If trainees are retained, the SQ/CC must make recommendations for AT.
   Circumstances and AT requirements are documented in the individual’s training record.
   Before controlling traffic at night, a minimum of one night OJT tour (for a minimum of 2
   hours) is required (paragraph A3.5). Note: The 560 FTS controllers are exempt from night
   requirements.
   A3.1.2. Complete four daylight tours before accomplishing a night tour.
   A3.1.3. Day tours and evaluations must be completed during periods when the status of
   flying permits an overhead pattern. The trainee is normally limited to one upgrade tour per
   day. Although highly discouraged, an OG/CC may authorize an additional tour based on
   unique training circumstances. However, do not conduct such a practice on a routine basis.
   A3.1.4. The trainee will receive OJT by actually controlling traffic while under direct
   supervision of an instructor controller. The instructor retains responsibility for a safe traffic
   pattern and will take control of the pattern if the trainee does not adequately respond to the
   situation. The training program should include provisions to ensure the trainee’s familiarity
   with his or her responsibilities when performing the monitor function.
   A3.1.5. Documentation showing the trainee’s progress must be maintained to ensure
   completion of all syllabus requirements before an evaluation.
   A3.1.6. Controllers transferred intracommand will receive sufficient training to ensure their
   familiarity with local operations.
   A3.1.7. Additional manning in the RCS during OJT tours will not be used as a substitute for
   normal manning requirements.
A3.2. Orientation. The trainee will:
   A3.2.1. Receive a briefing from the RSUTSO or RSUTO about the controller training
   program and the RSU’s role in the student training environment.
   A3.2.2. Study the appropriate publications concerning RSU operations.
   A3.2.3. If possible visit the tower and terminal radar facility to observe terminal activities
   and the interface with RSU operations.
A3.3. OJT Tour 1. The trainee is briefed on and observes the crew briefing, RCS and APU
preflight checks, and crew changeover procedures. He or she will practice controlling VFR
traffic.
AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010                                                           39

      A3.4.3.3. Coordination with other air traffic control agencies and the SOF.
      A3.4.3.4. Local landmarks, techniques, and guidance to safely facilitate normal traffic
      flow while maintaining specified separation standards and sequencing.
      A3.4.3.5. Traffic pattern priorities and breakouts.
      A3.4.3.6. Transient and civilian aircraft procedures.
      A3.4.3.7. Runway change procedures.
      A3.4.3.8. Reporting RCS discrepancies.
      A3.4.3.9. Control of ground aborts.
      A3.4.3.10. Control of emergency aircraft, including aircraft chase procedures.
      A3.4.3.11. Overdue aircraft.
      A3.4.3.12. Lost student assistance.
      A3.4.3.13. Single and dual runway operations.
      A3.4.3.14. Situations that could result in a potential stall (tight downwinds, slow finals,
      etc.) and controller actions to prevent or correct the situation.
      A3.4.3.15. Specific guidance on when to issue go-around instructions.
      A3.4.3.16. Flying status changes.
      A3.4.3.17. Weather recall and diversion procedures.
      A3.4.3.18. Local contingency plans (Broken Arrow, SCATANA, etc.).

A3.5. OJT Tour 10 (2 Hours Minimum at Night). This lesson may be accomplished anytime
during scheduled night flying--after completing four OJT tours and before assuming
unsupervised controller duties at night. Completion of this tour is desired, but is not a
prerequisite for the controller’s initial evaluation.
   A3.5.1. Brief the trainee on the following procedures as they differ from daytime
   procedures:
       A3.5.1.1. Traffic patterns.
       A3.5.1.2. Common pilot errors.
       A3.5.1.3. Separation standards.
       A3.5.1.4. Emergency procedures.
       A3.5.1.5. RCS lighting.
       A3.5.1.6. RSU duties and responsibilities.
   A3.5.2. The trainee practices controlling and monitoring night traffic, as applicable.
A3.6. OJT Tour 11 (2 Hours Minimum at an Auxiliary Field). This lesson must be
accomplished only if aircraft flown by the trainee uses an auxiliary field. The tour may be
accomplished anytime after the trainee completes four OJT tours, and it is a prerequisite to
assuming unsupervised controller duties at the auxiliary field. Completion of this tour is desired,
but not a prerequisite for the controller’s initial evaluation.
   A3.6.1. Brief the trainee on procedures at the auxiliary field as they differ from those at the
   home field.
   A3.6.2. The trainee will practice controlling traffic at the auxiliary field.
A3.7. AHC/ELP Qualification. Controllers may upgrade to AHC/ELP controller after a
minimum of six solo tours. Exception: Previous controllers may upgrade to AHC/ELP controller
during requalification training. Before performing AHC/ELP controller duties, trainees will
receive a briefing from the RSUTSO or RSUTO, an AHC/ELP pilot, and receive one OJT tour.
There is no minimum length for the OJT tour. After the training is accomplished, document
qualifications on the Letter of Xs.

                         STANDARD RSU RADIO TERMINOLOGY

A4.1. Overview. Table A4.1 through Table A4.5 contains standard RSU radio terminology.
However, this terminology is not intended to cover every situation or restrict the use of
additional terms. When communicating with aircrews, RSU controllers are expected to use good
judgment and have the flexibility to use concise, common-sense, directive language appropriate
for the situation. They must use timely, clear, concise, standard terminology that communicates
the same meaning to all AETC crews.

A4.2. Issuing Instructions. When issuing instructions, RSU controllers will normally refer to
the aircraft’s position rather than its call sign. RSU controllers will identify the source of the
transmission when using a guard channel; for example, “Final, go-around, Westwind on guard.”
However, RSU controllers or observers do not normally use terms such as “number one” or
“number two” to identify a pattern position because pilots to whom instructions are issued may
not know their relative position. To prevent confusion between pattern position and formation
position, identify aircraft in formation by call sign.

REDUCED SAME RUNWAY SEPARATION (RSRS)FOR TRAINER-TYPE AIRCRAFT
                        OPERATIONS

A5.1. Similar Trainer-Type Aircraft Operations:
   A5.1.1. Similar trainer-type RSRS may only be applied using alternate runway side
   procedures. Similar trainer-type aircraft are defined as aircraft with the same airframe; for
   example, T-38 to T-38 or AT-38, T-1A to T-1A, and T-6 to T-6.
   A5.1.2. When alternate runway side procedures are used; RSRS for T-6 and T-38 patterns is
   3,000 feet or when the preceding aircraft is airborne. When alternate runway side procedures
   are not used, the minimum RSRS is 6,000 feet. Note: T-1A aircraft will not use alternate
   runway side procedures. For a T-1A following a T-1A, the minimum RSRS is 6,000 feet or
   when the preceding aircraft is airborne.
   A5.1.3. The use of alternate runway side procedures is an aircrew responsibility and must be
   addressed in local operating procedures.
   A5.1.4. RSRS is not authorized for T-43 aircraft.
   A5.1.5. An RSRS of 3,000-feet may be applied between a formation landing and a
   subsequent single aircraft (of a similar type) if both formation aircraft are positioned on the
   cold (exit) side of the runway and the single aircraft lands on the hot side of the runway.
   Ensure 6,000 feet RSRS in front of a formation landing.
   A5.1.6. Before clearing any single aircraft for takeoff, controllers must ensure the hot side of
   the runway is clear. Before clearing any formation takeoff, controllers must ensure the entire
   runway is clear.
   A5.1.7. RSRS requirements remain the same for a wet runway as a dry runway.
A5.2. Dissimilar Trainer-Type Aircraft Operations. Separation for dissimilar trainer-type
aircraft is 6,000 feet.
A5.3. Night Operations. During night operations, 6,000 feet is the minimum separation for all
aircraft types.

            TRAFFIC PATTERNS FOR HOME AND AUXILIARY FIELDS

A6.1. T-6 and T-38 Aircraft:
   A6.1.1. The T-6 traffic pattern altitude is normally 1,000 feet AGL. The T-38 traffic pattern
   altitude is normally 1,500 feet AGL.
   A6.1.2. Establish an initial approach of 3 to 5 nautical mile (nm), measured from the pitch
   point. Radar-controlled aircraft may enter the initial from either side if the entry point is
   located outside of VFR traffic.
   A6.1.3. Establish a VFR entry and reentry leg that is entered from a turn from one side only.
   Aircraft entering on the VFR entry leg must be wings level on the entry leg at least 1 nm
   before entering the pattern or converging with other aircraft and must give way to aircraft
   established in pattern.
   A6.1.4. A common entry leg may be used for both VFR and radar sequence entries if right-
   of-way priorities are established where aircraft converge and provisions are made for aircraft
   forced to give way. Aircraft must be wings level at least 1 nm before converging points and
   must converge at a 45-degree angle in level flight to facilitate clearing.
   A6.1.5. Units will establish pattern right-of-way priorities, breakout, and go-around
   procedures for aircraft that converge onto a common ground track. (Note: Units will develop
   local guidance to resolve conflicts between straight-in and final turn aircraft.) An aircraft:
      A6.1.5.1. On a 90- or 45-to-initial that is giving way to aircraft on initial will climb a
      minimum of 500 feet and reenter at the VFR entry point, request radar initial, or fly
      straight through on an offset initial, obtaining spacing and letting down to traffic pattern
      altitude during the turn to outside downwind.
      A6.1.5.2. Giving way on VFR entry leg will climb a minimum of 500 feet and reenter in
      the VFR entry point.
      A6.1.5.3. On a straight-in approach that perceives a conflict with an aircraft turning final
      will discontinue the approach and offset the ground track away from the final turn.
      A6.1.5.4. Breaking out from inside or outside downwind will climb a minimum of 500
      feet and reenter at the VFR entry point or request radar initial.
      A6.1.5.5. Breaking out from low closed downwind will maintain 500 feet below pattern
      altitude and reenter at the VFR entry point or request radar initial.
      A6.1.5.6. Breaking out of the traffic pattern will advise the controlling agency by
      position.
   A6.1.6. Pattern spacing will normally be obtained by adjusting the position of the crosswind
   leg.
   A6.1.7. Radar service may be terminated before actual pattern entry if the approach control
   facility establishes aircraft separation and sequencing before termination point and a
   prescribed ground track and airspeed are flown from termination point to the pattern.
AETCI11-204_12FTWSUP_I 21 JUNE 2010                                                                47


   A6.1.8. Weather minimums must ensure that VFR conditions, including required cloud
   clearance and visibility, can be maintained during all portions of the pattern.
   A6.1.9. Units will develop procedures to permit pitchouts and closed patterns opposite the
   normal direction of break at auxiliary fields. Establish go-around, breakout, and reentry
   procedures to prevent conflicts.
   A6.1.10. Establish runway change procedures to ensure an orderly transition to the new
   pattern.
A6.2. T-1 Aircraft:
   A6.2.1. Pattern Altitude. The T-1 traffic pattern and outside downwind altitude is normally
   1,500 feet AGL; the closed pattern altitude is normally 1,000 feet AGL.
   A6.2.2. Initial Approach. Establish an initial approach of 3 to 5 nm miles, measured from
   the pitch point. Radar-controlled aircraft may enter initial from either side if the entry point is
   located outside of VFR traffic.
   A6.2.3. VFR Entry and Reentry. Establish a VFR entry and reentry leg that is entered
   from a turn from one side only. Aircraft entering on the VFR entry leg must be wings level
   on the entry leg at least 1 nm before entering the pattern or converging with other aircraft and
   must give way to aircraft established in pattern.
   A6.2.4. Common Entry Leg. A common entry leg may be used for both VFR and radar
   sequence entries if right-of-way priorities are established where aircraft converge and
   provisions are made for aircraft forced to give way. Aircraft must be wings level at least 1
   nm before converging points and must converge at a 45-degree angle in level flight to
   facilitate clearing.
   A6.2.5. Right-of-Way Priorities. Units will establish pattern right-of-way priorities and
   breakout procedures for aircraft that converge onto a common ground track. An aircraft:
      A6.2.5.1. In the overhead that is giving way to aircraft on final approach will climb 500
      feet and reenter at the VFR entry point.
      A6.2.5.2. In the closed pattern that is giving way to aircraft on final approach will
      maintain pattern altitude and reenter at the VFR entry point.
      A6.2.5.3. That is giving way on VFR entry leg will climb 500 feet and reenter at the
      VFR entry point.
      A6.2.5.4. On a straight-in approach that perceives a conflict with an aircraft turning final
      will discontinue the approach and offset the ground track away from the final turn.
   A6.2.6. Pattern Spacing. The crew will normally obtain pattern spacing by adjusting the
   position of the crosswind leg.
   A6.2.7. Radar Service. Radar service may be terminated before actual pattern entry if the
   approach control facility establishes aircraft separation and sequencing before termination
   point and a prescribed ground track and airspeed are flown from the termination point to the
   pattern.

  A6.2.8. Weather Minimums. Weather minimums must ensure that VFR conditions,
  including required cloud clearance and visibility, are maintained during all portions of the
  pattern.
  A6.2.9. Runway Change Procedures. Units must establish runway change procedures to
  ensure an orderly transition to the new pattern.
