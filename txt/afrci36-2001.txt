                      STANDARDS OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1.1. Purpose. This chapter provides standards of professionalism and integrity for AFR
recruiters. Malpractice, misconduct, and irregularities by recruiting personnel will not be
tolerated. Recruiting personnel who violate any standard are subject to disciplinary action under
the UCMJ, Article 92. Recruiting personnel must report actual or suspected recruiting
malpractice, misconduct, or irregularities to their flight chief. The Recruiting Service
Commander initiates inquiries into all allegations of professional misconduct.
1.2. Recruiting Malpractice. Recruiters will not conceal or conspire to conceal a disqualifying
factor; or take any action to qualify an ineligible applicant in violation of directives.
   1.2.1. Do not mislead or misinform a prospect or applicant regarding any aspect of recruiting
   policy, procedures, entitlements, benefits, or any intentional misinformation designed to
   induce an applicant to apply for or accept enlistment, commissioning, assignment or
   appointment.
   1.2.2. Do not initiate any action to influence attorneys, law enforcement officials, or judicial
   authorities to release, dismiss, drop charges, or otherwise mitigate dispositions in order to
   qualify an individual for AFR accession. Recruiting personnel will not accompany applicants
   to court.
1.3. Recruiting Misconduct. Recruiters will maintain high standards of conduct and be totally
professional in their relationships with applicants.
   1.3.1. Do not release any applicant information to agencies or persons outside the
   Department of Defense (DOD). Refer inquiries to the flight chief.
   1.3.2. Do not become involved or otherwise assist in General Educational Development
   (GED) testing of individuals beyond advising them to contact the nearest state education
   official authorized to administer the GED test.
   1.3.3. Do not attempt to develop or maintain an intimate personal relationship with
   applicants, such as making sexual advances toward applicants or seeking or accepting sexual
   advances from applicants.
   1.3.4. Do not date any applicant whose processing has not been terminated by the applicant's
   withdrawal from processing (no longer interested), or by failure to meet accession
   requirements (disqualification). Dating a Delayed Entry Program (DEP) member or accessed
   Non-Prior Service (NPS) applicant who has not completed all Initial Active Duty for
   Training (IADT) requirements including Split Training Option (STO) is also prohibited.
   1.3.5. Do not use rank or position, threats, pressure, or promise the return of a favor or
   favorable treatment in an attempt to gain sexual favors from applicants.
   1.3.6. Do not use personal resources to provide applicants with lodging or transportation.
   1.3.7. Do not accept an applicant's personal belongings or household goods for storage or
   any other reason.
 10                                                           AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009


   1.3.8. Do not sponsor an alien for permanent residence by citing the AFR as a prospective
   employer.
   1.3.9. Recruiters may answer correspondence from an overseas APO or FPO address.
   Forward foreign correspondence received from a non-APO or non-FPO address to
   AFRCRS/RSOO.
1.4. Referring Complaints and Inquiries. Do not advise, instruct, or otherwise assist persons
with policy and procedure complaints or inquiries to contact the AFR Liaison at Lackland AFB
TX, HQ AFRC, or congressional representatives. Refer official inquiries, allegations, or
complaints received directly from AFR members, parents, legal officials, or legislative
representatives from any level of government to the flight chief. Flight chiefs will contact
AFRCRS/RSM and subsequently notify their Squadron Staff regarding receipt of any
congressional inquiries. Do not release the personal phone numbers of recruiting or medical
personnel. See Attachment 17 for further guidance.
1.5. HQ Recruiting Service Inquiries. When asked, provide information directly to AFRCRS
or Squadron Staff as directed. After providing information, brief the flight chief to ensure
officials within the chain of command are made aware of the circumstances.
1.6. Personnel Information File (PIF). Flight chiefs may maintain PIFs on all subordinate
personnel according to current directives.
1.7. Basic Military Training (BMT) Elimination. If a BMT elimination is traced to recruiter
lack of responsibility or negligence, accession credit may be removed and appropriate
training/counseling/discipline provided.
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                           11


                                            Chapter 2

                         RECRUITER MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE

2.1. Purpose. This chapter provides directives for recruiter management items.
2.2. Inter-service Recruitment Committee (IRC). Flight chiefs or designated individuals will
attend IRC or Enlisted IRC/Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) Liaison meetings.
Although flight chiefs are nonvoting members of the IRC, it is still important they attend
meetings for awareness of scheduling/changes/requirements and to resolve potential processing
issues or needs.
2.3. Goal Allocation. Goal procedures and goal allocation are described by AFRCRS/RSOA in
AFRCI 36-2002.
2.4. Recruiting Awards Program. Awards that support the mission of AFRCRS are described
in AFRCI 36-2809, Awards, Ceremonies and Honors, Air Force Reserve Recruiting Awards
Program.
2.5. Enlisted Incentive Programs. The AFR Enlistment Incentive Program aids recruiters in
accessing qualified individuals into critical skills. Recruiters must understand and constantly sell
the available incentives. For specific information concerning incentive programs, refer to AFI
36-2638, Air Force Reserve Enlisted Incentives. Questions should be directed to the local
Military Personnel Squadron (MPS) for the Unit Program and the Air Force Reserve Personnel
Center (ARPC) for the Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) Program.
2.6. Recruiting Zones. Flight chiefs must establish a distinct and separate recruiting zone or
area of responsibility for each recruiter assigned a goal. Each Squadron will ensure flight chiefs
coordinate all recruiting zone changes with AFRCRS/RSOA.
   2.6.1. Each recruiter is individually responsible for effectively working his/her zone.
   2.6.2. Recruiters will not process applicants outside of their assigned zone unless specifically
   tasked by the flight chief. If a prospect living outside a recruiter’s zone is referred to them, or
   walks into their office and prefers to working with them, written approval must be received
   from the recruiter who works the zone where the customer lives and the flight chief must
   approve the request. The only valid method of approval is email.
2.7. Prospecting. Flight Chiefs will ensure their recruiters identify and interview qualified
applicants. Recruiters must effectively work all available resources to maximize success. (e.g.,
schools, rosters, active duty separations from all services, perpetuation, COI events, etc.)
   2.7.1. Line and Medical recruiter school programs are administered as follows:
       2.7.1.1. Line recruiters will establish an effective school program for each school they
       are responsible for (minimum of three) prior to the beginning of the school year. This will
       include gathering information about the staff, student population, and projected events
       and loading the information into the current AFRCRS approved lead management
       system. This program, though geared to the high schools, may include vocational schools
       and colleges. Recruiters should conduct interviews in school career counseling
       departments and attend special events such as job fairs. Additionally, supervisors will
 12                                                               AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009


      accompany all recruiters on at least one school visit during the current school year to
      ensure activities are student-centered and productive.
      2.7.1.2. OA recruiters establish meaningful visitation programs to guarantee sufficient
      candidates are available to fill unit and IMA vacancies. In addition, such visits establish a
      positive relationship with individuals in authority at these institutions. Visitations that
      should be accomplished for OA Recruiters would include College ROTC programs,
      Seminaries, separations briefings for other branches if permissible, and IRR Musters.
      Flight chiefs will accompany recruiters on school and residency program visits at least
      once a year to ensure activities are productive.
      2.7.1.3. Health Professions/Physician recruiters will maintain a school program as
      applicable to HP or Physician recruiting for each "recruitable" residency and all medical,
      dental and nursing (ADN- BSN) schools in their assigned zone. Residency program
      contact and school visits are essential to publicize medical reserve component incentive
      programs such as the Air Force Ready Reserve Stipend Program (AFRRSP). Visits to
      Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) inform health professionals about AFR
      opportunities. Flight chiefs will accompany recruiters on school and residency program
      visits at least once a year to ensure activities are productive.
2.8. Leads. Leads obtained from any source must be refined using the current AFRCRS
approved lead management system.
   2.8.1. Lead refinement is considered complete when the recruiter has either conducted an
   interview with the applicant or is convinced the individual is disqualified for, or no longer
   interested in joining the AFR. The recruiter must document the reason.
   2.8.2. Recruiters will attempt to contact all leads within 5 workdays of receipt. Recruiters
   will notify the flight chief immediately if they cannot access their leads. Emphasis should be
   placed on the actual contacting of leads versus the number of attempts to contact.
   2.8.3. The recruiter must document in detail all actions and follow-up in the current
   AFRCRS approved lead management system.
   2.8.4. Leads are individuals who contact the Air Force Reserve directly with a desire to join.
      2.8.4.1. Leads for all recruiters are normally acquired through but not limited to:
          2.8.4.1.1. AFRC 800 number leads.
          2.8.4.1.2. School visits.
          2.8.4.1.3. Palace Chase/Palace Front briefing leads.
          2.8.4.1.4. Recruiter-generated mail-back cards.
          2.8.4.1.5. Individual Ready Reserve (IRR)/Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC)
          mail- out replies.
          2.8.4.1.6. Center Of Influence (COI) events, air shows, mall visits, high
          school/college career fairs, etc.
          2.8.4.1.7. IRR Muster leads.
          2.8.4.1.8. E-Advisor leads.
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                        13


          2.8.4.1.9. Any other lead designated as such by AFRCRS/RSOO.
      2.8.4.2. Leads for In-Service Recruiters (ISRs) are all eligible active duty separatees.
      Members will be contacted according to required standards based upon projected
      separation dates. ISRs with an assigned off base recruiting zone will contact all leads
      defined in paragraph 2.8.4.1. These leads will be contacted as defined in paragraph
      2.8.2.
   2.8.5. Prospects are lists of individuals who have not taken direct action to pursue the Air
   Force Reserve. Direct contact with prospects should result in a promotion of status to lead.
      2.8.5.1. Prospects for Line Recruiters will be contacted according to supervisor
      instructions, as priorities dictate. Flight chiefs will evaluate recruiter’s productivity and
      promote prospects to leads as mission requirements dictate. Prospects are normally
      acquired through:
          2.8.5.1.1. Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) military
          interested/test qualified juniors and seniors within 100 miles of the Flight Office or
          within 50 miles of Line Satellite offices.
          2.8.5.1.2. IRR rosters - Individuals assigned to the Air Force Reserve in an inactive
          status.

      2.8.5.2. Prospects for ISRs assigned an off base recruiting zone will be contacted
      according to supervisor instructions.
      2.8.5.3. Prospects for Health Professions Recruiters consist of lists of people reflecting
      basic educational qualifications; that is, residency lists or fully qualified physicians (PS
      or NPS), and AFRCRS-provided leads (e.g., Air Force Opportunity Center, JRAP,
      worldwide web, etc.).
2.9. Production Evaluations. Production Evaluations (PE) are performed to identify reasons
for deficient production.
   2.9.1. Production Evaluations will be conducted three times annually:
      2.9.1.1. 1 Sep (Less than 100% of goal achieved) – completed by Squadron or HQ Rep
      only.
      2.9.1.2. 1 Jan (Less than 30% of goal achieved) – completed by Flight Chief or Squadron
      Staff.
      2.9.1.3. 1 Apr (Less than 60% of goal achieved) – completed by Squadron Staff or RS
      Representative.
   2.9.2. Production evaluations are required when production falls below acceptable
   established standards as directed by AFRCRS/CC.
   2.9.3. Production evaluations must be of sufficient depth to determine the type of problem
   that exists. Evaluations should be conducted using the Production Evaluation template
   provided by AFRCRS/RSM. The PE provides the data for Flight Chiefs to develop and
 14                                                                 AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009


   execute a plan of action, which provides recruiters clear written guidance on what
   improvements are needed to meet production standards.
   2.9.4. The RSM will generate a list identifying recruiters who fall below expectations; and
   forward the to the Squadron Superintendent for review and recommendation. The Squadron
   Superintendent will coordinate PE completion or recommended action with the Flight Chief.
   The Superintendent will then forward the list to the RSM with recommended actions.
   2.9.5. Flight chiefs must ensure production evaluations are completed on a timely basis and
   follow-up is conducted to determine the success of the plan until performance reaches an
   acceptable level.
   2.9.6. The Squadron Commander and Superintendent review the evaluations for
   training/compliance problems and provide results to AFRCRS/CCC. After review, the
   production evaluation is returned to the senor recruiter for inclusion in the individual’s
   Personal Information Folder (PIF), training performed will be placed in the AF 623.
2.10. Oath of Enlistment/Administer Appointment:
   2.10.1. A notary public or active duty, reserve, guard, or retired commissioned officers of
   any component of the US Armed Forces may administer the oath to persons being appointed
   to the AFR.
   2.10.2. Recruiting personnel (all grades) who are notary publics will not use their status as
   notaries to administer oaths or authenticate copies of substantiating documents for any armed
   forces enlistment, assignment, or appointment applicant. Additionally, AFR recruiting
   personnel will not use other U.S. Armed Forces recruiting personnel who are also notaries to
   authenticate copies of documents used for AFR accessions.
   2.10.3. AFR recruiting personnel who are commissioned officers are authorized by Title 10,
   United States Code (USC), Section 936 to administer oaths.

       transferred to the Obligated Reserve Section (ORS) or the Nonaffiliated Reserve Section
       (NARS), and notary publics may not administer the enlistment oath.
2.11. Reimbursable Items. When any agency requires a fee for providing information, the
burden of payment rests with the applicant. When necessary and otherwise authorized (e.g.,
photographic copies of vital documents for applicants), recruiters may pay the fee and claim
reimbursement using SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business
IAW AFRCI 10-301, AFRC Recruiting Service (AFRCRS) Resources and Budget Management.
2.12. Notification Procedures for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Positive
Applicants. See Attachment 2 for specific notification procedures.
2.13. National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). This Act, also known as "Motor Voter,"
requires recruiters to assist citizens in registering to vote. All recruiters assigned to off base
offices will brief civilians on the NVRA. If anyone requests voting assistance from a recruiter
located on a military installation, they should be directed to the voting assistance officer for that
installation. See Attachment 3 for specific program instructions.
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                         15


2.14. Blocking Procedures. Recruiters must make every attempt to block positions through
Reserve Management Vacancy System (RMVS). If RMVS is not working or inaccurate at your
location, notify your Flight Chief who in turn will elevate it to the Squadron and HQ level if
necessary. While RMVS is not working, recruiters may use other means (e.g. telephone, e-mail,
face-to-face contact, etc.) to search for vacancies.
2.15. Planning Guide. Recruiters must use and maintain a planning guide (paper or electronic)
for each fiscal year. The planning guide must be available to the flight chief for use in case of
emergency, desk-top audits, production evaluations, staff assistance visits, and compliance
inspections The planning guide should include but is not limited to the following: all scheduled
and walk-in appointments, DET follow up, follow-up appointments (testing and MEPS
processing), school visits, itinerary stops, radio station visits, local advertising, SF 1164, Claim

                          STANDARDS OF BASIC ELIGIBILITY

3.1. Eligibility Requirements. Applicants must meet all eligibility requirements identified in
this instruction. Recruiters must question applicants to determine if they meet standards of basic
eligibility. Tactfully dismiss disqualified applicants unless a waiver/review is requested,
warranted and authorized, and accession of the applicant would be in the best interests of the
AFR. Waivers/Reviews are processed as outlined in Table 10.1. In questionable cases, use the
recruiting chain of command for clarification and guidance.
   3.1.1. Sexual orientation is a private matter. Applicants for enlistment or appointment may
   not be asked, or required to reveal, their sexual orientation. All applicants, regardless of any
   statements in regard to sexual orientation will be treated with professionalism and respect.
3.2. Recruiter Discretion. Accession to the Selected Reserve (SelRes) may be denied to any
individual although the applicant meets enlistment/appointment/assignment criteria when, in the
recruiter’s judgment (with flight chief concurrence), accession would not be in the best interest
of the AFR. EXAMPLE: Trend of missed appointments, presenting false documents, failure to
disclose potentially disqualifying factors, etc. Detailed documentation of the reasons must be
entered on the Applicant Data Report (ADR) for the flight chief’s review. Contact AFRC/RSOO
for concurrence.
3.3. Applicant Screening. Applicants will be tentatively qualified using this instruction of
basic accession eligibility criteria and the specific program chapter under which they are being
accessed. Use the recruiting tool "CCMAPPEDDS" (see Attachment 1 for definition). These
procedures describe how to interview and qualify an applicant, and are mandatory to prevent the
waste of time and money.
   3.3.1. Recruiters will not process applicants at all unless the applicant has had an initial face-
   to-face interview with an AFR recruiter and:
       3.3.1.1. The applicant is within height/weight or body fat standards. (Air Force Reserve
       recruiters will not perform body fat measurements (BFM)
       3.3.1.2. The applicant proves they have a Social Security Number (SSN) established in
       their name. Applicants who do not have a SSN should be directed to the nearest Social
       Security Office to register.
   3.3.2. Information, using CCMAPPEDDS, may be obtained over the telephone after
   briefing the Privacy Act of 1974. Annotate the current AFRCRS approved lead management
   system.
3.4. Initial Interview. Conduct the interview and document applicant information and
responses on the ADR. Processing and follow-up activities should be documented in detail as an
Outreach on the ADR.
   3.4.1. At the beginning of the initial face- to -face interview, brief the applicant on the
   Privacy Act. Provide all applicants with a copy of the AF Form 883, Privacy Act Statement -
   U.S. Air Force Application Record.
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                                      17


      3.4.2. Applicants will be briefed on the Applicant Briefing Item on Separation Policy
      (Attachment 5) prior to any processing.
      3.4.3. . During the initial face- to- face interview, screen applicants for any potentially
      disqualifying factors, (e.g., history of a UIF, Domestic Violence Conviction, Felony
      Conviction, Government travel card abuse, drugs, conduct, etc.)
      3.4.4. Complete or obtain these documents during the initial face-to-face interview (See
      Chapter 9 for form requirements):
         3.4.4.1. AF Form 2030, USAF Drug and Alcohol Abuse Certificate. If an applicant
         refuses to complete the AF Form 2030, terminate the interview and tactfully dismiss the
         applicant.
         3.4.4.2. Medical screening form DD Form 2807-2, Medical Prescreen of Report of
         Medical History for all applicants (EXCEPTION: Palace Chase/Palace Front
         accessions), and DD Form 2697, Report of Medical Assessment, as applicable.
         3.4.4.3. Once tentatively qualified, provide NPS applicants for enlistment (not leading to
         commission) with a Non-Prior Service Information Handout. Health Professions
         recruiters provide their applicants with an AFRC Form 136, Health Professions Officer
         Application Worksheet.

  Commissioned Grades and Designation and Assignment in Professional Categories—Reserve
  of the Air Force and United States Air Force, for Personnel Security Investigations (PSI).
  2. Contact the wing/base security manager to validate security clearance status on all prior
  service applicants being enlisted or assigned. If a current, valid clearance cannot be verified
  through the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) then a security clearance must be
  accomplished using eQIP.
  3. When submitting a security clearance through eQIP, if the submission is rejected by JPAS
  contact AFRCRS/RSOO for instructions. Do not enlist or assign without approval from
  RSOO.
     3.5.4. For applicants requiring a PSI, initiate a Top Secret clearance through eQIP, and
     accomplish fingerprint cards. OLs may negotiate with a local authority (civilian or military)
     to have the required fingerprint cards accomplished.
     3.5.5. For Individual Reserve Program applicants requiring a PSI, recruiters are responsible
     for initiating a Top Secret clearance through eQIP.
     3.5.6. Aliens in possession of an USCIS Form I-551, Alien Registration Card must not be
     enlisted into a flying AFSC until the recruiter verifies a Single Scope Background

 NOTE: To be eligible for appointment into the AFR, an NPS applicant must be a U.S. citizen
 according to AFI 36-2005. Although, dual citizenship is not an automatic disqualifier, it is a
 condition that raises a security concern and may be a disqualifying factor for a security
 clearance. Reference AFI 31-501, para 5.7. for further guidance.
   3.6.1. Recruiters must brief NPS alien applicants that once they enter the AFR they cannot
   reenlist until they have attained United States citizenship. In addition, they must understand
   United States citizenship is not automatically conferred upon enlistment. Once the applicant
   serves one year in the AFR, he/she may become eligible to petition to obtain United States
   citizenship.
       3.6.1.1. Applicants unable to speak, read, write, or understand the English language
       sufficiently to ensure the applicant can satisfactorily absorb required training are not
       eligible for the Air Force Reserve. No waiver is authorized.
   3.6.2. An applicant holding dual citizenship, (U.S. and other country citizenship) may be
   eligible for enlistment into the AFR. There is no requirement to denounce citizenship so long
   as U.S. citizenship can be proved. However, there may be restrictions into specific AFSCs
   that require certain security clearances. Reference Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory
   (AFECD)/Air Force Officer Classification Directory (AFOCD) in all such cases prior to
   continuing processing.
3.7. Special Interest Requirements. All recruiters must be knowledgeable of the following
special accession guidance. They apply to all AFR accessions. Please see Table 3.5 for
processing guidance under these conditions.
   3.7.1. Responses to special interest questions (e.g. Government Travel Card, Unfavorable
   Information File (UIF), etc. listed in Table 3.5) are recorded on the ADR and transferred to
   DD Form 1966, Record of Military Processing--Armed Forces of the United States, or AF
   Form 1288, Application for Ready Reserve Assignment, when appropriate.

      4 Domestic Violence                                         Attachment 9
 NOTES:
 1. Recruiters who receive information about an applicant that may be covered by this policy
 must immediately contact their flight chief. The flight chief will contact AFRCRS/RSOO
 immediately for instructions on how to properly proceed in this situation. Due to the sensitive
 nature of this topic, flight chiefs must take steps to limit access to the details of an actual
 homosexual conduct allegation/disqualification to only those individuals having a direct need
 to be involved. After notification to AFRCRS/RSOO, the flight chief will ensure their
 Squadron Staff is made aware of the circumstance.
 2. At the initial interview, recruiters must question applicants for misuse or delinquency of
 their government travel card and annotate their response on the appropriate form as required.
 3. At the initial interview recruiters must question applicants on history of UIF or similar
 derogatory information contained in applicants’ military records and annotates their response
 on the appropriate form as required.
 4. During initial interview, recruiters must question applicants on any history of a conviction
 for a crime of domestic violence. See Attachment 9.
3.8. Moral Conduct. All applicants must be of sound moral character. Applicants convicted or
adversely adjudicated for offenses shown in Tables 3.6 and 3.7 may be ineligible for accession.
The recruiter may submit a fully supported and authorized waiver.
   3.8.1. Self-admitted offenses (cannot be retracted) will not be treated as an admission of
   guilt, but may require waiver determination.
   3.8.2. For NPS applicants (including NPS with prior military time), consider all occurrences
   of convictions and adverse adjudications (including UIF, convictions of domestic violence,
   and UCMJ action, e.g., Article 15, courts martial, etc.) regardless of when the incident
   occurred.
   3.8.3. For PS applicants, do not consider convictions or adverse adjudications, which
   occurred before, or during active duty or active participation in a reserve component
   providing the applicant received a separation or discharge that is eligible for affiliation to the
   AFR. Drug related incidents are to be evaluated no matter when they occur. All special
   interest items must be considered. Refer to Table 3.5, Special Interest Requirements.
         3.8.3.1. Consider all AFR IRR applicant convictions or adverse adjudications that
         occurred while assigned in the IRR. Although these individuals are already members of
         the AFR, they are subject to the misconduct offense criteria of Tables 3.6 and 3.7 for
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                       23


     accession purposes. Air Force Reserve IRR members who disclose misconduct
     violations, are ineligible for further processing. See Chapter 10 for waiver/review
     requirements and authority.
  3.8.4. Make applicants aware of the importance of revealing all law violations, regardless of
  disposition. Inform applicants Defense Investigative Services (DIS) will conduct a security
  investigation. DIS will match information provided by the applicant with local, state, and
  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) records. Any disparity in this information could result
  in job cancellation or discharge from the AFR.
  3.8.5. When applicants disclose they had a documented offense, were an adjudicated Youth
  Offender (YO), or have a sealed or expunged record, they must reveal the actual charge and
  disposition. If they refuse, recruiters will terminate the interview and tactfully dismiss them.
  Therefore, it is imperative applicants disclose the facts, if they wish to be considered for
  accession. Detailed information on documented offenses (to include YO, sealed or expunged
  record information) is available to agencies performing security clearance investigations such
  as Defense Investigative Service (DIS) and Air Force Office of Special Investigation
  (AFOSI). A conduct waiver/review is required if any offense is disqualifying. Use Chapter
  10 for waiver/review procedures.
  3.8.6. The primary source of criminal history and law violation information is the personal
  interview, as documented on the ADR and any other application form. During the initial
  interview, recruiters must question the applicant and document all civilian law violations and
  adverse military justice actions (including administrative punishments, non-judicial and
  judicial military justice actions). Administrative actions are not considered law violations but
  are recorded as a means of identifying the underlying conduct that caused the action (this
  conduct then may be evaluated and may disqualify the individual). Recruiters will record all
  offenses, documented or self-admitted on the ADR and any other accession form calling for
  this information. EXCEPTION: Overtime parking tickets or any ticket written by a private
  security firm or campus police agency. Use Tables 3.6 and 3.7 to determine applicant
  eligibility.
     3.8.6.1. Accuracy and honesty are paramount. Recruiters must inform applicants they are
     required to disclose all charges and findings regardless of the final disposition to include:
         3.8.6.1.1. Charges that have been dropped, dismissed, or expunged.
         3.8.6.1.2. Findings of not guilty.
         3.8.6.1.3. Criminal cases that have been placed into sealed records.
         3.8.6.1.4. Criminal cases that have been adjourned in contemplation of dismissal.
         3.8.6.1.5. Youthful offender adjudications.
         3.8.6.1.6. Criminal convictions of domestic violence, which have been pardoned or
         set aside.
     3.8.6.2. Use of the DD Form 369, Police Record Check, is mandatory only when the
     applicant admits to a potentially disqualifying offense or whenever the recruiter has
     reason to doubt the information provided by the applicant. When the DD Form 369 is
     mailed, record the date on the ADR. Maintain a copy in the case file. When authorities
     refuse to honor a DD Form 369 or a law enforcement agency does not reply to your DD
 24                                                                  AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009


        Form 369 within 21 days from date the form was mailed, annotate this on the ADR. Rely
        on the information/documentation provided by the applicant to determine eligibility and
        further processing.
        3.8.6.3. If an applicant discloses a disqualifying offense and a waiver/review is
        warranted, the applicant bears all expenses incurred for police record checks and court
        document fees. In all other cases, recruiters are authorized reimbursement when the
        agency charges a fee for release of information.
        3.8.6.4. When DD Form 369 is required; forward it only to the location(s) where the
        offense(s) occurred, to include continental United States (CONUS) and overseas U.S.
        military installations. Do not send a DD Form 369 to any foreign law enforcement
        agency.
        3.8.6.5. The DD Form 369 is not the only document that may be used to determine the
        law violation history of an applicant (e.g., legal documents, etc). When documents other
        than the DD Form 369 are used, these documents must be treated like the DD Form 369
        and attached to the completed Accession Data Sheet, as shown in Tables 9.1 and 9.3.
     3.8.7. Individuals with a subpoena or open warrant (such as bench warrants) discovered
     during the recruiting process will be tactfully disqualified. Recruiters will report the incident
     to their Flight Chief, who will determine if notification of other agencies is required. The
     Flight Chief will contact AFRCRS/RSOO for guidance in questionable cases.
     3.8.8. Use Table 3.6 for conditions of conduct ineligibility.

Table 3.6. Misconduct Conditions Which Render Applicants Ineligible.

 R                                                                                 Waiver

   3.8.9. Table 3 7 is a listing of offenses categorized by the degree of seriousness. This list of
   offenses is a guide and applies to all accessions. Consider a violation of a similar nature or
   seriousness the same as the categories listed. See Table 3.8 for waiver/review authority for
   all enlistment applications. Use Table 3.7. For all conduct offenses.

 NOTES:
 1. These waivers will only be considered on a case- by- case basis and must warrant meritorious consideration. Consider an
 offense of a similar nature or seriousness as a Category 1 offense (felony).
 2. Consider an offense of a similar nature as Waiver Category 2 offense when the maximum possible confinement under
 local law exceeds 1 year.
 3. In doubtful cases, treat a conviction or adverse adjudication of a similar nature as a Category 3 offense when the maximum
 possible confinement under local law exceeds 4 months, but not more than 1 year.
 4. Consider traffic violations treated as serious by law enforcement agencies as Category 4 offenses (including boating,
 aviation, and similar recreational vehicle offenses). In doubtful, non-traffic cases treat a conviction or adverse adjudication of
 a similar nature as a Category 4 offense when the maximum possible confinement under local law is four months or less.
 5. Consider a conviction or adverse adjudication of a similar nature (including boating, aviation, and similar recreational vehicle
 offenses) and traffic offenses treated as minor by local law enforcement agencies, as Category 5 offenses. If the offense is a
 parking ticket, count and document only tickets written by law enforcement officers for parking in prohibited zones, regardless
 of location. Do not count or document any overtime parking tickets or parking tickets issued by a private security firm, campus
 police, etc.
 6. A 3-month waiting period is required following termination of parole, probation, suspended sentence, or any period of
 confinement. (EXCEPTION: Suspended sentences for minor traffic offenses, community service and restraint for offenses
 that do not require a waiver.)
 7. Refer to AFI 36-2005 for waiver approving authority for applicants identified for appointment in the AFR

  NOTES:
  1. Submission of an assignment waiver is authorized. However, this is not a recruiting
  waiver. For unit accessions, coordinate waivers through the servicing MPS. For Individual
  Ready Reserve accessions, coordinate waivers through the RMG/CC according to AFI 36-
  2115.
  2. Applicant must have either official documentation from the National Personnel Records
  Center (NPRC) showing an attempt to verify the periods of PS or NPRC copies of
  reconstructed service records. See Table 10.1, Rule 21 for waiver requirements.
  3. A waiver for financial hardship will not be considered until 1 year after the discharge
  date.

   4. Members released from AD and placed on the Temporary Disability Retired List (TDRL)
   are ineligible. Individuals declared as physically unfit on a Retirement Special Order-
   Physically Unfit, are also ineligible for enlistment. Applicants released from the TDRL and
   declared fit on a Retirement Special Order-Removal from TDRL, are eligible for enlistment
   without a waiver if otherwise qualified.
   5. This is not a recruiting waiver, but an assignment waiver. HQ AFRC/A1(Unit) and
   RMG/CC (IMA) hold commissioning authority for the AFR and allows provisions for
   waiver procedures of twice deferred officers according to AFI 36-2005, and AFI 36-2115.
   See Table 10.1., Rule 27 for waiver requirements.
6. Waiver not required for individuals who have taken a voluntary reduction in grade to join
another branch of service.
7. General Discharge from reserve/guard components is waiverable only for "Non- Participation." A waiver for
non-participation is not required when the member has subsequent satisfactory/honorable
service, regardless of component. See Table 10.1, Rule 12 for waiver requirements.
8. A waiver will be considered if marginal/minimal producer or performer if due to a
deficiency in aptitude during technical training. See Table 10.1, Rule 11 for waiver
requirements.
9. A Family Care Waiver must be submitted if required by Table 3.19, regardless of RE Code.
If the RE Code is ineligible and the SPD reflects pregnancy, a Family Care Waiver must be
approved prior to submitting a RE Code waiver/review. See Table 10.1, Rule 21 for waiver
requirements.
10. Process applications for retired applicants from any air component (RegAF, AFR, ANG),
using the same guidelines and criteria for processing prior service IRR applicants. The
Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) has the final approval/disapproval authority to assign
retired personnel, per USC Title 10, Chapter 1223, Section 12741, Retirement from Active
Reserve Service Performed after Regular Retirement. Approval/disapproval authority has been
delegated to AF/RE for all enlisted applicants. There is no waiver for SECAF disapproved
applications.
     a. For Unit programs, process application through the gaining wing commander to the
        gaining MPS. Recruiters should ensure to maintain a complete copy of the application
        prior to submission to the MPS. The MPS will forward the application to the appropriate
        NAF/DPMF, HQ AFRC/A1K, HQ AFRC/CV, AF/REPP, AF/RE, and SECAF in turn.
        AF/REPP will provide approval/disapproval status to A1 and RS.
     b. For IMA programs, process the AF Form 1288 through the appropriate RMG
        Detachment Program Manager and HQ RMG/DP/CC. Upon receipt of the AF 1288 from
        the MAJCOM forward the application to HQ ARPC/RSOO for processing within
        ARPC. Recruiters should ensure they maintain a complete copy of the application prior
        to submission to HQ ARPC/RSOO. For accurate processing, indicate to HQ
        ARPC/RSOO that it is a retiree application. HQ ARPC/RSOO will forward it to
        AF/REPP and SECAF as required. AF/REPP will provide approval/disapproval status
        to A1 and RS.

   3.10.1. NPS enlistments include DET discharged or Entry Level discharged individuals.
   Consider individuals discharged with less than 24 months Active Duty or Active Duty
   Training and who have not previously completed IADT in its entirety (BMT follow on TT)
   with any branch of the U.S. Armed Forces as NPS applicants.
       3.10.1.1. All DEP discharged applicants receive an order reflecting the reason for
       discharge. This reason may appear as a narrative or as a DEP discharge code (see
       Attachment 13).
       3.10.1.2. Recruiters must obtain an appropriate source document (e.g., MEPS document
       showing DEP discharge code, DEP discharge order, etc.) showing the reason for the
       discharge action prior to processing an individual who has been DEP discharged.
       3.10.1.3. In addition to a DEP discharge order, the MEPS maintain DEP discharge codes
       on file in their computer system for 2 years following discharge.
       3.10.1.4. Depending on the amount of time that has passed since discharge and other
       circumstances, this order may be obtained from the individual, the MEPS discharging the
       individual, or NPRC.
   3.10.2. A PS applicant’s background must be aggressively reviewed by recruiters to ensure
   the AFR only accesses those individuals who have shown past honorable service. Accession
   of applicants with unacceptable prior service records is not in the best interest of the AFR.
   Verification of the applicant's character of prior service is imperative.
       3.10.2.1. Before processing for accession into the SelRes, the applicant must provide
       documented proof verifying character, affiliation, and term of prior military service. Use
       Table 4.2 to determine the appropriate verification documentation and minimum
       requirements for verifying character of service.
       3.10.2.2. Recruiters must verify accession eligibility codes of each different type of
       military service the applicant served. Table 3.10 lists three different types of service
       (AD/EAD, National Guard, and Reserve) an applicant could have potentially served.
       Recruiters must use this table to determine if the applicant is eligible based on separation
       from each branch (USA, USN, USMC, USCG, USAF) as applicable.
EXAMPLE: An applicant who separated from the Army with 4 years AD with an honorable
discharge and good RE Code/SPD, then joined a Naval Reserve unit for 2 years with a general
discharge, and is currently in the Army National Guard is ineligible because he/she was
disqualified in the Naval Reserve. The applicant requires eligibility in the following areas:
Table 3. 10, Section I for AD active duty Army service.
Table 3. 10, Section II for ARNG Army National Guard service.
Table 3. 10, Section III for USNR Navy Reserve service.
       3.10.2.3. The applicant must qualify in each of the three sections. Ineligibility in any
       section, regardless of eligibility in another section, renders an applicant ineligible for
       service in the AFR. EXCEPTION: Does not apply to applicants with subsequent
       satisfactory service in the Air Force or an ARC.
       3.10.2.4. Use Table 3.10 to determine PS applicant eligibility.
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                     39

 1. Verify the previous RE Code under RSOT tab located on the CoP for PS Air Force
 members whose DD 214/215 reflects a 3S (SSB - Special Separation Benefit) or 3V(VSI -
 Voluntary Separation Incentive). If the RE Code assigned prior to approval for the voluntary
 separations program is eligible, individual may be enlisted, if otherwise qualified.
 2. Except as authorized in this chart, individuals receiving a RE-2 (with or without a suffix,
 except RE-2C or 2X) after 1 July 1976 are ineligible, waiver are authorized on a case –by-
 case but must beapproved by the gaining Wing CC or Designated Representative or RMG/CC
 for IMA gains. Waiver for Air Force RE-2C reflecting involuntarily separated with an
 honorable discharge or entry-level separation without characterization of service will be
 considered for academic failure only by AFRCRS/RSOO (process IAW Table 10.1 Rule 29).
 All other conditions require approval by gaining Wing/CC or Designated Representative; or
 RMG/CC for IMA gains. Waiver for RE-2X reflecting involuntary discharge with an
 honorable discharge or entry-level separation without characterization of service will be
 considered on a case by case basis by AFRCRS/RSOO when there is no history of derogatory
 information during service time. All other conditions require approval by Wing/CC or
 Designated Representative; or RMG/CC for IMA gain.

      3.10.2.6. A recruiter may submit a fully justified request for a waiver for an applicant
      who received an honorable discharge from any branch of the Armed Forces, but whose
      DD Form 214/215 contains a RE code or SPD that is a bar to enlistment. However, the
      discharge must not have been due to punitive or administrative action that involved
      defective character traits, unsuitability, or nonperformance of duty. Waivers/reviews
      should only be done when processing the waiver/review is clearly in the best interest of
      the Air Force Reserve. The waiver/review can be disapproved at any level in the approval
      process. Refer to Chapter 10 for waiver/review procedures.

      3.11.1.1. Physicals may be accomplished at any military medical facility. However, they
      must be reviewed and countersigned by an Air Force (or ARC) competent medical
      authority prior to further processing. The review and countersign requirement does not
      include MEPS physicals.
      3.11.1.2. Air Reserve Component IRR applicants may be given a required medical
      examination in an active duty Military Treatment Facility (MTF) when an ARC medical
      unit is not available. This includes going to an active duty MTF for specialty consultation
      and diagnostic laboratory tests to evaluate abnormal findings on initial physical
      examinations and/or to determine their medical qualification for continued military duty.

      (MHSS) Matrix.
   3.11.2. Medical Screening:
      3.11.2.1. Screen all applicants for potentially disqualifying medical conditions that may
      render them unfit for service in the AFR. Ensure all applicants complete a DD Form
      2807-2, except Palace Chase/Palace Front accessions. Compare their responses on the
      form with the list of potentially disqualifying conditions contained in DoDI 6130.03,
      Enclosure 4. In questionable cases, recruiters consult their supervisor before initiating the
      physical process.
      3.11.2.2. A physical examination will not be administered until the applicant for
      enlistment has received qualifying ASVAB scores.
      3.11.2.3. The date of the physical must be within 24 months of date of enlistment except
      Palace Chase/Palace Front. Flying class 1/1A physicals are valid for 48 months.
      3.11.2.4. In- Service Recruiters and recruiters assigned in-service duties will brief all
      Palace Chase and Palace Front applicants using the Medical Statements for Assignments.
      The recruiter must verbally brief, and all applicants must sign the Medical Statement for
      Assignments. The briefing will be accomplished during the application process before the
      applicant can be assigned to the Air Force Reserve. The recruiter will annotate the
      briefing was accomplished in the comment section of the ADR. All yes answers must be
      forwarded to AFRCRS/RSOO for evaluation and qualification. Flight Chiefs will validate
      that this has occurred during the package QC.
      3.11.2.5. Recruiters are not authorized to enlist an applicant before receiving that
      applicant’s completed physical including HIV and Drug and Alcohol Test (DAT) test
      results. Working copies of physicals may not be used for accession purpose.
      3.11.2.6. Applicants entering the AFR (Unit or IMA) from active duty Air Force
      (includes AGR) or the Air National Guard can be accessed regardless of
      height/weight/BFM as long as they meet the current Air Force fitness standard. They
      must have official documentation to verify they have a PFT score of 75 or above dated
      within 12 months. All other applicants must meet current height and weight or BFM
      standards as directed in AFI48-123V2, Attachment 4.
      3.11.2.7. Recruiting personnel will not perform body fat measurements. Approved Air
      Component (AC) military medical personnel, trained AC medical unit personnel, AC
      trained orderly room personnel, or Health and Wellness Center (HAWC) personnel will
      administer BFMs.
      3.11.2.8. Once in the AFR, everyone must meet current Air Force fitness standards.
      3.11.2.9. Use Tables 3.11 and 3.12 to qualify prospective applicants.

        Notes:
        1. In accordance with AFI 10-248, Fitness Program, chapter 6.1, weight and body fat
        determination (as accomplished at MEPS or other point of entry to the service) remain
        part of accession physical standards and may also be used as entry criteria for
        accession training programs.
        2. If an applicant exceeds the listed maximum weight standards, then body fat
        measurement (BFM) will be performed as described in DODI 1308.3. To qualify for
        entry, a male BFM can be no more than 20% and female BFM, no more than 28% for
        ages up to 30 years. At age 30 and older the body fat limit is no more than 24% for
        males and 32% for females.
        3. If the applicant passes the BFM, processing can continue, and if during subsequent
        processing the applicant’s weight is found to be at or below the maximum weight standard, no further
        BFM is required.
        4. If the initial BFM exceeds standards, the applicant will be temporarily disqualified
        until such time that either the maximum weight standard or BFM is met to continue
        processing.
        5. Maximum weight standards and BFM, if applicable, are used only as accession
        standards. Active duty members will be managed according to their fitness score IAW
        AFI 10-248. For all cross-training and entry to special duty programs, ie, flying
        training programs, individuals must complete all four components of the fitness test
        and have a composite score of 75 or greater.
        See AFI 48-123V3 Attachment 4.30 for additional requirements for flying applicants.
        6. Applicants who fall below the minimum weight standards shall be referred for
        medical evaluation. If no disqualifying causes are found as described in Attachment 2
        of this instruction, a waiver may be considered by Air Education and Training
        Command (AETC)/SGPS. For ARC, refer to AFI 48-123V4, Table A2.1.

NOTES:
1. Permanent orthodontic appliances may be removable or attached. Temporary appliances
(also known as retainers) may be fixed or removable also.
2. Military training includes AD, Active Duty for Training (ADT) and Initial Active Duty For
Training (IADT) but does not include initial Inactive Duty Training (IDT) performed on the
Date of Enlistment (DOE).
3. Applicants may be scheduled for physical examination and enlistment only if they provide a
letter from their orthodontist stating active treatment is complete and all orthodontic appliances
(except retainers) will be removed at the applicant's expense before IADT.
4. Applicants must obtain an additional letter from the orthodontist verifying removal of the
orthodontic appliances before departing for military training.
5. Advise applicants wearing retainers that the AFR assumes no responsibility for continuing
care.
6. PS applicants may be considered for a waiver for use of orthodontic appliances if required
ADT is not in excess of 30 days.
    3.11.6. MEPS Medical Issues:
         3.11.6.1. When a disqualified (DQ) MEPS physical shows the applicant does not meet
         medical standards for accession, the applicant cannot take a new physical at an RMU.
         Applicants whose completed physical is DQ for entrance into military service by MEPS
         requires a waiver approved by HQ AFRC/SGP.
            3.11.6.1.1. If the MEPS places a written recommendation for a waiver on the
            physical, the waiver must be submitted, unless the applicant is ineligible for some
            other reason.
         3.11.6.2. An applicant may be DQ by MEPS prior to the physical process being
         completed. An applicant determined disqualified by the MEPS CMO (further processing
         not justified) on the DD Form 2807-2, will not be allowed to further process (complete
         the physical) without a written memo from the appropriate SG waiver authority
         requesting the MEPS to complete the medical examination.
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                  51


        3.11.6.2.1. Flight Chiefs may request waiver for disqualified physicals without a
        MEPS recommendation. Exercise good judgment in these matters. Contact
        AFRCRS/RSOO or HQ ARPC/RSOO in questionable cases
        3.11.6.2.2. Forward available physical documentation (e.g., DD Form 2807-2, etc.)
        to AFRCRS/RSOO. Include a statement that SG request MEPS (specify location)
        complete the physical on the DQ applicant based on their recommendation that a
        waiver will be authorized.
        3.11.6.2.3. The MEPS will complete the physical with the SG letter of request. Once
        the physical is complete, forward it to AFRCRS/RSOOSG waiver consideration.
        3.11.6.2.4. The gaining unit commander (unit accessions) or RMG/CC (Individual
        Reserve Program accessions) must express acceptance when the applicant may be
        medically restricted to certain duties.
     3.11.6.3. Any NPS or PS applicant who receives a "3" profile on a MEPS physical is
     disqualified (MEPS "3" is equivalent to an Air Force "4"). The Reserve Medical Unit
     (RMU) cannot override a MEPS disqualification, or re-profile any "3" profile generated
     by MEPS.
        3.11.6.3.1. Individuals with physicals DQ by a MEPS and wishing to present
        additional medical information on their behalf must be referred to the MEPS. The
        MEPS medical officer qualifies, disqualifies, or recommends waivers as appropriate.
        No profile done at MEPS may be changed by another medical facility except as
        follows:
            3.11.6.3.1.1. An H-2 (hearing) profile given by MEPS may be adjusted to an H-1
            profile provided the individual meets the hearing requirements in AFI48-123. An
            Air Force RMU may correct this profile on the back of the DD Form 2807-1, and

            3.11.6.3.1.2. An Air Force RMU may revise a MEPS generated "3" profile on PS
            applicants processed under retention standards according to AFI48-123, or AR
            40-501, if the applicant meets the criteria in AFI48-123, and MEPS has not

               3.11.6.3.1.2.1. A MEPS physical may be considered under retention
               standards only if the physical specifically states this in block 77 of the DD
               Form 2807-1, EXAMPLE: retention, world-wide duty, etc. The MEPS
               determines which applicants are processed under retention standards using the
               criteria in MEPCOM regulations.
            3.11.6.3.1.3. HQ AFRC/SG, MEPS and RMUs are authorized to change profiles

NOTES:
1. Members released from AD and placed on the (Temporary Disability Retired List) TDRL
are ineligible. Those individuals, who are declared physically unfit on a Retirement Special
Order- Physically Unfit, are also ineligible for accession. Applicants who are released from the
TDRL and declared fit on a Retirement Special Order-Removal from TDRL, are eligible for
accession consideration, without a waiver, provided they are otherwise qualified.
2. Excessive is defined as any tattoo/brands that exceed ¼ of the exposed body part and those
above the collarbone and readily visible when wearing an open collar uniform. Includes
tattoos/brands anywhere on the body that are prejudicial to good order and discipline or of a
nature that tends to bring discredit upon the AFR in or out of uniform. Body piercing is
attaching, affixing, or displaying objects, articles, jewelry or ornamentation to or through the
ear, nose, tongue, or any other exposed body part while in uniform. EXCEPTION: females
may wear earrings as authorized by Air Force standards of appearance. Reference AFI 36-2908.
Call AFRCRS/RSOO in questionable cases. A Military Image Determination may be submitted

    3.11.8. PS Physical Standards:
       3.11.8.1. Anyone who is currently a member of the Armed Forces (active or inactive) or
       a PS applicant within 180 days of discharge date (at time of oath administration) is
       exempt from pre- accession drug and alcohol testing. HIV screening is required if over 90
       days have passed since their discharge date.
       3.11.8.2. Applicants reassigned to the IRR who have an ALC for the weight management
       program require a waiver to remove the code. See Table 10.1, Rule 26.
       3.11.8.3. Palace Chase/Palace Front members who have an ALC "C" on the Records
       Review Report on Individual Personnel (RRRIP) or Detailed Single Unit Retrieval
       Format (SURF), must have their medical records reviewed and approved by the
       appropriate ARC/SG prior to assignment or enlistment into the AFR.
       3.11.8.4. Members applying for flying positions must be administered a flight physical
       examination. The examination report must be reviewed and approved by HQ AFRC/SGP
       before assignment or enlistment.
       3.11.8.5. Enlisted members assigned to a unit aircrew position within 3 years of
       separation from a RegAF, AFR, or ANG flying assignment do not require HQ
       AFRC/SGP certification if they are entering into the same AFSC previously held and
       they do not require a waiver.
 54                                                              AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009


       3.11.8.6. Applicants for aircrew positions who obtained Initial FCIII physicals certified
       by any USAF Major Command (MAJCOM) before separation from AD, do not require
       re-certification by HQ AFRC/SGP (Unit and Individual Reserve Programs). The physical
       must be current and applicable to the aircrew position in which the member will be
       accessed.
       3.11.8.7. Pregnant members requesting retraining (non-flying), must obtain approval
       from the gaining commander before their assignment or enlistment. Pregnant members
       must complete any non-flying course of training before their 34th week of pregnancy.
       Pregnant members may not perform any military duties past the 34th week of pregnancy
       according to AFI 36-2254 V2, Reserve Personnel Participation and Training
       Procedures.
           3.11.8.7.1. Pregnant active duty members currently serving in aircrew AFSCs will
           not be DQ for AFR affiliation due to pregnancy. However, the recruiter must obtain
           approval of the gaining unit commander before processing a Palace Front assignment
           or enlistment. This does not apply to those members applying for retraining or entry
           into a new aircrew AFSC since they cannot meet the physical qualification for the
           flying position and are not considered fully qualified.
   3.11.9. Use Table 3.16 for physical standards.

Table 3.16. Physical Standards (see notes).

    a. When using a MEPS physical:
       (1) If a positive response is not annotated on the DD Form 2807-2 for a condition listed
       in DoDI 6130.03, Enclosure 4, continue processing the applicant.
       (2) If a positive response is annotated on the DD Form 2807-2 for a condition listed in
DoDI 6130.03, Enclosure 4, this does not constitute an immediate medical disqualification by
the recruiter. Follow the instructions outlined in DoDI 6130.03, Enclosure 4.
    b. When using an existing physical:
        (1) If a positive response is not annotated on the DD Form 2807-2 for a condition listed
        in DoDI 6130.03, Enclosure 4, continue processing the applicant.
        (2) If a positive response is annotated on the DD Form 2807-2 for a condition listed in
DoDI 6130.03, Enclosure 4, this does not constitute an immediate medical disqualification by
the recruiter. Immediately contact the RMU for further guidance. Attach the DD Form 2807-2
with documentation requested by the RMU. The applicant will not be gained until cleared by the
RMU. The RMU signature (in Section V) on the DD Form 2807-2 will reflect the applicant’s
clearance to continue processing.
         (3) If the RMU determines review by a military physician is required, the RMU will
return the DD Form 2807-2, signed by a military physician, with the appropriate block marked
in Part V, no later than the first duty day following the next scheduled UTA. In questionable
cases, contact AFRCRS/RSOO for guidance.
5. The Physical (Preventive) Health Assessment Program is the current Annual Physical
Program for all active duty Air Force personnel. For accession purposes, a PHA consists of the
SF 600, Chronological Record of Medical Care, overprint (current within the directives of this
table); any official medical examination documentation identified as a PHA by competent
medical personnel; along with any supporting medical documentation. In questionable cases,
contact AFRCRS/RSOO for guidance.
6. For accession purposes, a PHA (flying) consists of any official medical examination
documentation classified as a PHA (flying) by competent medical personnel (to include the SF
600 overprint); and any supporting medical documentation. In questionable cases, contact
AFRCRS/RSOO for guidance.
7. Members assigned to the IRR (Rule 5 only) without a physical dated within 36 months cannot
participate except to in-process and obtain a periodic physical examination. The gaining Wing
Commander, or designated representative, must indorse the statement "I understand this
member will not be a participating asset until they are medically cleared for duty" on the AF
Form 1288. The recruiter must schedule the physical examination through the local RMU and
include the date in the recruiter’s endorsement of the AF Form 1288 prior to submitting the AF
Form 1288 for gain action. The senior recruiter should validate the examination date during the
QC process.
8. A positive responses on the DD Form 2807-2 for a condition listed in DoDI 6130.03,
Enclosure 4 requires review by the local RMU (unit accessions and Individual Reserve Program
accessions). A complete periodic physical examination may be required at the discretion of the
medical- reviewing officials.
9. A physical profile is required for all accessions. The most current physical profile will be

 11. All applicants that are processing using an existing physical (i.e. applicant is not taking a
 new physical at MEPS or the RMU) must be asked the following question and the response
 annotated as an outreach in the current AFRCRS approved lead management system. Any "yes"
 answer must be evaluated for qualification through AFRCRS/RSOO. "Have you received
 counseling or treatment for Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
 Disorder (ADHD), Adjustment Disorder, Anxiety Disorder, Depression or alcohol, drug, or
 substance abuse? Have you ever, or do you currently take medication for any of these
 conditions?"
3.12. Education and ASVAB. Educational requirements for commissioning are specified in
AFI 36-2005. College students in their third or fourth year of Reserve Officer Training Corps
(ROTC) are obligated to active service and are not eligible for the Air Force Reserve.
   3.12.1. The only minimum educational requirement is for 17 year old NPS applicants. To be
   eligible to enlist in the AFR, a 17-year-old applicant must either:
       3.12.1.1. Possess a high/home school diploma, or
       3.12.1.2. Have completed one semester of college level credit, or
       3.12.1.3. Be a high/home school junior, senior, or graduate and begin IADT within 270
       days after enlistment (IAW AFI 36-2254V1, Chapter 3, paragraph .3.1.2.); possess a
       letter of intent to graduate from the school they are presently attending (school must be
       an accredited educational institution), or
       3.12.1.4. Be an alternate credential holder (Tier Two). (Attachment 1, Educational
       Credentials for GED)
       3.12.1.5. NOTE: In order to be eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve
       (MGIB- SR) or the MGIB-SR Kicker, the member must have completed the requirements
       of a secondary school diploma, i.e. possess a High School Diploma or an equivalency
       certificate (GED, State certified Home School certificate). The member should provide a
       copy of the diploma to the Wing Education and Training office for validation and update
       of education benefits.
   3.12.2. There is no other minimum educational requirement for enlistment; however, mental
   and aptitude criteria differ between the educational tiers. ASVAB results are directly related
   to an applicant's educational tiers. Use Table 3.17 to correlate education and ASVAB score
   requirements.
   3.12.3. Unless otherwise provided in this instruction, all college and university course
   credits must have been earned from a school listed in the Accredited Institutions of
58                                                               AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009


  Postsecondary Education (AIPE), published by the American Council on Education

  http://www.ope.ed.gov/accreditation/Search.asp                                               or
  http://www.acenet.edu/resources/memberdirectory/index.cfm?tab=T.To determine if
  credit should be awarded, use the most current AIPE guide or the edition for the last year
  individual attended (during the period the applicant attended). In questionable cases contact
  AFRCRS/RSOO to ensure the school is accredited. Schools not listed are unacceptable for
  advanced enlistment grade under the Stripes for Education and Training Program (see Table
  5.1). If high school transcripts are used to determine high school accreditation they must bear
  the original signature of the school issuing official or the raised seal. Two and four year
  college transcripts must be embossed with the school seal (raised or stamped).
  3.12.4. The ASVAB evaluates specific aptitude areas and provides percentile scores that are
  used for selecting and classifying individuals for the Armed Forces.
     3.12.4.1. There are two ASVAB testing programs: production and student.
         3.12.4.1.1. The production test involves authorized testing, such as testing at a MEPS
         or Mobile Examining Team (MET) site. The test results are given directly to the
         appropriate recruiting service and are for its use only.
         3.12.4.1.2. The student ASVAB test is offered on a voluntary, "no cost" basis to
         educational institutions (high schools and vocational trade schools). Test results are
         provided to the school, student, and all recruiting services. Although test scores may
         be used for enlistment purposes, the Department of Defense advertises the student
         version primarily as a counseling tool. Guidance concerning the student ASVAB
         program is in AFI 36-2016, Armed Services Military Personnel Accession Testing
         Programs.
     3.12.4.2. An ASVAB score is valid for initial enlistment purposes 2 years from the date
     of the test (unless test scores have been verified in the Recruiter Eligibility Data Display
     for Prior Service). This includes both Enlistment Tests and Student Tests.
         3.12.4.2.1. An ASVAB test within 2 years of any previous ASVAB test is a retest.
         This includes both student and production tests. A valid retest invalidates all previous
         test results. Applicants who have taken an initial ASVAB, student or production, can
         retest after 1 calendar month has elapsed. Applicants who have taken the first retest,
         whether student or production, can retest after 1 calendar month has elapsed. Third
         and subsequent retests can be administered after 6 calendar months have elapsed from
         the date of the last test. USMEPCOM Regulation 611-1 prescribes the retesting
         policy.
         3.12.4.2.2. Use the most recent valid ASVAB results for enlistment. For Prior
         Service applicants, use the most recent ASVAB scores listed in the Recruiter
         Eligibility Data Display (REDD) system (must be re-normed) or a valid retest,
         whichever is most current. AFI 36- 2101 Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and
         Enlisted) prescribes the minimum scores required to enter an Air Force Specialty
         (AFS).
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                         59


      3.12.4.3. Parental or guardian consent is not required for ASVAB testing of an applicant
      less than 18 years of age. However, applicants 16 years of age may not be administered a
      production version of the ASVAB.
      3.12.4.4. Verification screening is performed on all ASVAB tests administered by the
      MEPS. This screening process identifies irregular scoring patterns and can result in a
      mandatory Verification Index (VI) test. If the applicant does not take the VI test, the
      MEPS commander invalidates the scores for enlistment purposes. After the VI test, the
      resulting test scores are considered valid. VI testing does not constitute a retest unless the
      entire battery is given.
      3.12.4.5. An applicant who has answered at least one question on the ASVAB is
      considered to have tested.
      3.12.4.6. For the purpose of this instruction, the Armed Forces Classification Test
      (AFCT) will be treated equivalent to the ASVAB as long as the AFCT is properly
      utilized in accordance with AFJI36-2016 Armed Services Military Personnel Accession
      Testing Programs and AFI 36-2605 Air Force Military Personnel Testing System,
      Attachment 5.
   3.12.5. Use Table 3.17 for ASVAB testing guidance.

  NOTES:
  1. No waivers or exceptions.
  2. For retest purposes, 6 months is defined as six calendar months.
  3. Two retests may be authorized before 6 months have elapsed from the initial test. After the
  second retest, a 6-month wait for any further retesting is mandatory. There is a mandatory 6
  month wait for retesting whenever the previous test is invalidated.
  4. A properly completed MEPCOM Form 680-3, Request for Examination, is the authority for
  a retest. However, if the retest occurs less than 6 months after the initial test, approval must be
  obtained from the flight chief.
  5. Retesting after 1 month and before 6 months following the initial test date is permitted if
  the following criteria are met:
      a. One month has lapsed between the initial test and the first retest and between the first
  retest and the second test.
      b. Retesting is being requested because the initial scores do not appear to reflect the applicant’s true
      capability (consider the applicant's education, training, and experience).
      c. The retest is not being requested solely because the applicant's initial scores did not meet
  the standards prescribed for an enlistment option or program.
  6. In cases where compulsory (verified by the school) student testing occurs after an
  individual has previously taken an ASVAB test, use the resulting scores from the student
  version for enlistment, provided the student test is administered more than 30 days after the
  previous test.
     3.12.6. Use Table 3.18 for education credentials and tiers guidance.

     3.12.7. ASVAB Requirements for PS applicants whose scores can be verified in the
     Recruiter Eligibility Data Display (REDD) system or a valid retest as stated in 3.12.4.2.1,
     where previous test scores have been verified (AFQT verification is required), and are
     entering into:
        3.12.7.1. A previously awarded AFS (to include Military Occupational Specialties
        (MOS)/Naval Rates/Naval Enlisted Codes (NEC)/Job Codes converted to an AFSC)
        which has not been withdrawn due to passage of time; the test scores are valid for
        enlistment.
        3.12.7.2. An AFSC never previously awarded (retraining); the applicant must meet all
        M-A-G-E score requirements for the AFSC according to Air Force Enlisted

    counseled on family care responsibilities before they obligate themselves to the AFR.
       3.13.1.1. Ensure all applicants fully understand the unique demands of military service,
       the necessity for making and maintaining family care arrangements, and that failure to
       make such arrangements may subject the member to disciplinary action or involuntary
       separation according to AFI 36-2908, Family Care Plans.
    3.13.2. Use Table 3.19 to determine eligibility for enlistment, based on family member
    status. This Table does not apply to Palace Front, Palace Chase, or Air Reserve Component
    accessions. Family care accession criteria for officer appointments are identified in AFI 36-
    2005.

 NOTES:
 1. Recruiters must directly question applicants concerning any changes, or expected changes in
 family status (that is, pregnancy of wife or female companion, pending divorce, voluntary or
 legal separation, etc.). Any change or expected change that renders or could render the applicant
 ineligible at a later date is disqualifying, and may require an approved enlistment waiver/review
 before the applicant is eligible to enter the AFR.
 2. Two separate disqualification issues may apply if applicant has two or more family members
 incapable of self-care. A basic family care waiver which uses Table 10.1, Rule 13, and a
 disqualification for financial reasons due to family care responsibilities (E-3 or below with 2 or
 more family members) which uses Table 10.1, Rule 14. If an applicant falls into both
 categories, process one waiver for approval by the wing commander. The waiver/review code is
 BBA.
 3. Voluntarily or legally separated applicants with any minor family members and no court
 order that has or will be issued are ineligible. If a court order is issued due to legal separation
 proceedings, this order is temporary in nature and in no way constitutes a final decree, also
 rendering the applicant ineligible. If the separation is involuntary due to employment or
 attendance at school, the applicant must obtain a notarized statement from the spouse stating
 reason for separation. The applicant is considered "married" in this case. Include the notarized
 statement with the appropriate family care waiver.
 4. No restrictions for PS applicants qualified to enlist in grade E-4 or higher.

     3.14.1. The illegal or improper use of drugs and alcohol is not condoned and, in most cases,
     renders an applicant ineligible for accession. It may also seriously damage an AFR member's
     physical and mental health, place the safety of others in jeopardy, and result in criminal
     prosecution and discharge under less than honorable conditions.
     3.14.2. In most cases, applicants are in-eligible for accession (see Table 3.20) if they:
        3.14.2.1. Have ever illegally used drugs.
        3.14.2.2. Have been convicted of illegal use or involvement with drugs.
        3.14.2.3. Have had any adverse adjudication for illegal use or involvement with drugs.
        3.14.2.4. Have been diagnosed as an alcoholic.
        3.14.2.5. Self admit to alcoholism or alcohol abuse.
     3.14.3. Applicants are not allowed to change their minds concerning admissions of drug
     abuse. If an applicant admits to drug abuse, but then claims to have misunderstood or been
     confused when told such drug abuse is disqualifying, the original statement must stand.
     3.14.4. Consider all admissions of drug use, no matter when they occurred.
     3.14.5. Use Table 3.20 for applicant eligibility for drug or alcohol use.

NOTES:
1. Non-experimental marijuana use must be identified to competent medical authority for
example, to the MEPS CMO or the unit CMO on the appropriate medical prescreening form, etc.,
for an evaluation to determine the applicant’s eligibility. The appropriate CMO or competent medical
authority makes the final determination of an applicants’ use of marijuana as
being experimental or non-experimental. Applicants are eligible if they are certified medically
qualified for accession by competent medical authority (that is, the MEPS CMO or unit CMO,
etc.). If the medical authority determines the applicant is psychologically dependent on or a
chronic user of marijuana, Rule 9 applies. The recruiter must obtain documentation from this

3.16. Service Credit and Military Service Obligation (MSO) Computation. Currently, an
individual's MSO starts at the time he or she first attains military status. The MSO ends if the
member is discharged. However, if a discharged individual with an unfulfilled MSO later regains
military status, the member incurs an MSO equal to the unfulfilled portion of the original MSO.
One year enlistments are not authorized for individuals who have not completed their MSO.

1. Recruiters must examine all source documents for any evidence of tampering or alteration.
The applicant is responsible for providing all source documentation.
2. Compare documents used for age verification with applicant's driver's license or Social
Security card to verify identity. If information on the documents does not correspond, require
applicant to:
a. Provide a court order showing a name change, or
b. Complete section VII of DD Form 1966 if appropriate (not applicable to aliens).
c. In questionable cases, stop enlistment processing until acceptable documents are presented.
3. FS Form 240 is available from Passport Office, Department of State, Washington DC 20524.
Certificates of Citizenship and Naturalization, which may prove a claim of citizenship, are
available through local U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) offices. The burden
of proof rests with the applicant to provide these documents.
4. Applicable to all schools authorized to issue such documents in the CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii,
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Canal Zone, Guam, and American Samoa.
5. Applicants educated in other than American educational institutions must have their
educational level evaluated before enlistment to qualify as a high school diploma graduate, or
higher. Transcripts must be translated into English (when required). These evaluations may be
obtained (at the applicant's own expense) through a state department of education, college or
university listed in the AIPE guide or from an independent evaluation service that is a member
of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services, Inc. (NACES). A list of
independent evaluation services is listed on the NACES website (link in the current AFRCRS
approved lead management system). To be valid, the evaluation must rank the applicant's
educational level (high school diploma graduate or higher).
6. Applicants possessing a certificate of proficiency issued by the California State Board of
Education are considered equivalent to state GED holders. A completed GEDTS Form 30 is
acceptable when accompanied by a letter of intent to issue a GED certificate, or when authorized
by the applicant's state or jurisdiction in lieu of a "letter of intent." High school diplomas issued
by state agencies based solely on GED completion are equivalent to GED certificates. Diplomas
based on the completion of additional courses (adult education and community colleges) are
acceptable as high school diplomas provided the applicant furnishes original or certified copies
of official transcripts showing these courses were satisfactorily completed.
7. Applicants who are not high school graduates that obtain subsequent education in an
accredited college or university are still classified as non-high school graduates until they
present proper documentation showing satisfactory completion of 15 or more semester hours or
22.5 or more quarter hours of post secondary credit. The educational institution must be listed in
AIPE, published by the ACE (for the year attended).

 8. DD Form 214/215 must specifically identify citizenship. EXCEPTION: Applicants
 separated/discharged after 30 November 1984 with an eligible reenlistment code and SPD/SDN,
 and claim U.S. citizenship, are U.S. citizens.
 9. To be used for citizenship validation, the official form or document must specifically identify
 citizenship.
 10. In addition to the USCIS Form I-551, citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the
 Republic of Marshall Islands or the Republic of Palau must have a properly stamped USCIS
 Form I-94.
 11. Canadian born American Indians are considered lawfully admitted aliens but are exempt
 from having to apply for or carry an USCIS Form I-551. For classification purposes, they are
 considered aliens. See the DD Form 1966 instructions for the special statement that must be
 entered in the remarks block of the DD Form 1966. A letter or other document from the tribal
 chief, council, or other reservation official will be used to verify the Canadian born American Indians’ age,
 name, and place of birth.
 12. This letter must be accompanied by a list of completed coursework.
 13. NPS applicants must have a valid Social Security Card prior to shipping to Basic Military
 Training.
 14. The member must have completed the requirements of a secondary school diploma, i.e.
 possess a High School Diploma or an equivalency certificate (GED, state certified Home School
 certificate) to be eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR) or the
 MGIB-SR Kicker. The member should provide a copy of the diploma to the Wing Education
 and Training office for validation and update of education benefits.




4.4. Verification of Prior Service. Verify RE codes that appear to have been altered, forged, or
issued in error through the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) Reenlistment Eligibility
Data Display (REDD) website (link in the current AFRCRS approved lead management system).
If a REDD report indicates an Interservice Reenlistment Eligibility Code (IRE) 5, 9, 0, or "not on
file," validate SSN, Date of Separation (DOS), and service branch, then make an additional
DMDC check. If the additional DMDC check remains IRE 5, 9, 0, "not on file," or shows an RE

                         NON-PRIOR SERVICE (NPS) PROGRAM

5.1. Program Requirements. This program applies to applicants for enlistment in the AFR
who have 83 days or less of AD or ADT with any branch of the United States Armed Forces and
who have not previously completed IADT in its entirety (BMT follow on TT).
5.2. Commissioning of NPS Line of the Air Force (LAF) Applicants. AFR recruiters may
recruit selected NPS individuals to fill unit and IMA commissioned officer LAF vacancies. PS
individuals are also eligible for this program if they have never held a commission. This is not a
re-commissioning program. Applicants must meet all other qualification requirements as
outlined in AFI 36-2005. A checklist is available on the CoP.
5.3. Enlistment of NPS Applicants. After qualifying the applicant using the eligibility criteria
in Chapter 3, use the following paragraphs and tables for specific program enlistment
procedures and special instructions. Any individual who meets these criteria and has completed a
recognized BMT may, with an approved waiver, be enlisted and placed on ADT for the duration
of the 84 days. See waiver requirements in Table 10.1, Rule 18.
   5.3.1. Individuals who enlisted under the Navy Reserve Advanced Pay Grade (APG)
   program often take many years to accumulate 84 active days of service credit. As a result, if
   an individual has successfully completed 2 years of satisfactory military service, a waiver is
   authorized. If approved, they will not have to attend Air Force BMT. See waiver
   requirements in Table 10.1, Rule 19.5.3.2
5.4. NPS Enlistment Grade and Incentives. Recruiters must carefully review their applicants’
qualifications to determine the appropriate enlistment grade and offer a NPS enlistment incentive
to those who are potentially eligible (e.g. Stripes for Education and Training, or Stripes for Unit
Bonus Skills). Current AFR enlistment incentive information is available in AFI 36-2638, Air
Force Reserve Enlisted Incentives.
   5.4.1. Determine NPS enlistment grade using Table 5.1.

  higher grade. Upon completion of IADT, they may be promoted up to and including the
  grade of E-4, depending on the Unit Manpower Document (UMD) position, according to AFI
  36-2502, Airman Promotion Program.
  5. Documents presented after enlistment may be used as a basis for changing the authorized
  enlistment grade up until the individual’s Basic Military Training graduation date. Recruiters
  will advise applicant to obtain documents before enlistment. However, this policy will allow
  an applicant who is in the process of completing additional college classes, etc. that will
  qualify them for a higher grade, to have the opportunity to have their records updated to
  reflect the higher grade.
  Grade Change procedure after enlistment, but BEFORE shipping to BMT:
       a. Recruit provides appropriate documentation for change in grade to recruiter.
       b. Recruiter makes grade determination. When a correction is appropriate, the recruiter
  presents documentation to the Flight Chief (or designee).
       c. Flight Chief or designee coordinates with unit DPMSC to retrieve the enlistment
  contract and makes correction to enlistment pay grade.
       d. Correction Process: (1) Documents to be corrected: DD 4/1, Section B, Agreements,
  Blk 8 (pay grade) and on DD 1966/3, Blk 32a, pay grade/rank.
          (2) Documentation: Member initials changes and signs in the right margins (both
  documents), authorizing official's name, grade, organization, and date with signature are also
  provided in the right margin (both documents). Top margins receive the words:
  "CORRECTED CONTRACT."
          (3) Distribution: Flight Chief or designee returns the corrected enlistment contract to
  DPMSC. DPMSC ensures all other copies of the enlistment contract are disposed of and
  replaced with the corrected contract.
       e. MILPDS Update: Appropriate unit DP office makes grade correction in MILPDS.
  Grade Change procedure AFTER recruit ships to BMT:
       a. AFRC Training Liaisons will collect appropriate documents from trainees (received in
  sealed envelopes from educational institutions only).
       b. AFRC Training Liaisons will make grade corrections as described in 5.d.(2) above for
  member's initials and signature only, provide information to member that the correction is not
  complete until authorized by AFRCRS/RSOO, and then transmits DD 4/1, DD 1966/3, and
  the document(s) for basis of change to AFRCRS/RSOO.
       c. AFRCRS/RSOO will make grade determination and forward to AFRC Training
       Liaison d. AFRC Training Liaisons advise member of corrected contract, provide
       member a copy, and place a copy of the corrected contract in the member's UPRG.
      e. Member receives appropriate grade insignia.
  6. Use official transcripts from an educational institution listed with the Accredited
  Institutions of Postsecondary Education (AICE) published by the American Council on
  Education (ACE) reflecting certification during the last year the applicant attended.
  7. With the approval of the unit commander, an individual with 60 or more semester hours,
  prior to enlistment, may be promoted to SrA, E-4 upon completion of IADT.
  8. Individuals are reduced to grade E-1 if eliminated from OTS or the AFRRSP according to
  AFI 36-2503, Administrative Demotion of Airmen. If individuals elect to remain in the AFR

  in enlisted status, they may be entitled to a higher grade according to this table or Table 6.2.
  9. Applicants must enlist in a unit bonus skill. Individuals who fail to obtain their 3-level (in
  the bonus AFSC in which they enlisted) are demoted to E-1 according to AFI 36-2503, unless
  qualified for a higher enlistment grade.


5.5. Counseling and Enlistment Procedures. Each recruiter is responsible for providing
comprehensive counseling to each applicant. Provide and review the "Non-Prior Service
Information Handout" with each applicant at the initial interview. All NPS applicants for
enlistment must view the BMT film prior to date of enlistment. Also, explain the following
applicable items:
   5.5.1. Ensure each applicant is briefed and understands all test and physical examination
   requirements.
       5.5.1.1. Refer to AFI 36-2101 for entry or award of an AFSC. Requests for exceptions to
       AFECD requirements may be submitted as classification waivers. ASVAB scores will
       not be waived, EXCEPTION: Composite scores for AFSC 2T231. See waiver
       requirements in Table 10.1, Rule 28, Note 14.
   5.5.2. Stress that an eligibility review will be conducted before departure for BMT. Advise
   each applicant the review will include:
       5.5.2.1. A height, weight, and, if required, body fat measurement check.
       5.5.2.2. Females must take a mandatory pregnancy test within 15 days of departure for
       BMT.
       5.5.2.3. Law and drug violation review, any changes to family status, as well as any
       other potentially disqualifying factors.
       5.5.2.4. NPS applicants must enlist in the AFR Selected Reserve for a period of 6 years,
       with a 2-year inactive service obligation (for a total of an 8-year MSO).
       5.5.2.5. All enlistees who are assigned to a training site beyond 100 miles or 3 hours
       one-way driving time must acknowledge their responsibility for any hardships, including
       financial, incurred in performing the duties of the assignment. They must understand that
       they will not be reimbursed for travel expenses incurred for inactive duty training.
5.6. IADT Blocking Procedures. Recruiters retrieve BMT and technical training requests
through HQ AFRC/A1TF. Only tentatively select course dates for Technical Training School
(TTS) and BMT on applicants who are fully qualified for enlistment (that is, have passed an
ASVAB test and entry physical). SSN provided must be an applicant's valid SSN. BMT date
should be at least 30 days in advance of current date. Requests for shipping in less than 30 days
must be coordinated with the MPS and should be the exception. Tentative blocks will not exceed
2 weeks in duration, after which time HQ AFRC/A1TF may cancel them. If extension is
required, HQ AFRC/A1TF must be notified via email. Individuals projected into an AFSC,
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                      81


which requires a security clearance upon entry into technical training, must not be scheduled to
begin BMT until 60 days or more after enlistment.
   5.6.1. When a TTS departure date is not available through HQ AFRC/A1KE, follow the
   guidance in the Split Tour Option (STO) Policy. This option should be used as a last resort.
   Applicant must start TTS no later than 365 days from return from BMT or he/she will be
   discharged from the Air Force Reserve. Recruiters record BMT date retrieved from HQ
   AFRC/A1KE on the Applicant's Statement of Understanding. Applicants must understand
   they will attend TTS based on the needs of the AFR and will attend the first available class
   date. If member is agreeable to the date and conditions for STO enlistment, the applicant
   signs and initials the Statement of Understanding.
5.7. Cancellation of BMT/ TTS Quota. The recruiter accomplishes all cancellations of
BMT/TTS quotas through HQ AFRC/A1TF and AFRCRS/RSOO. Cancellations should be
accomplished immediately upon notification/determination an applicant will not ship on a
scheduled departure date. Maintain copies of cancelled quotas in the Flight Office central files.
5.8. Enlistment Forms. Forms required for enlistment of NPS applicants are listed in Table
9.1.
5.9. Inactive Duty Training (IDT) Participation. All NPS excluding UFT selected applicants
will be allowed to participate for one period (not to exceed two periods) of IDT in order to
establish a pay date preceding IADT. This pay date will be the same date they took the oath of
enlistment and all NPS applicants will perform the duty at the time of their enlistment for pay
and points. During this process, the NPS enlistee is exempt from the uniform requirement for
IDT participation. Meaningful training will be provided to the NPS enlistee during this period.
   5.9.1. AF Form 40A will be used to authorize and certify pay and points as follows:
       5.9.1.1. Recruiters will initiate the AF Form 40A by completing the form without
       signatures.
       5.9.1.2. The authorizing official signs the AF Form 40A, prior to date of enlistment. The
       recruiter will certify training was performed by signing the AF Form 40A.
       5.9.1.3. The authorizing official must be designated by the wing commander and sign the
       AF Form 40A prior to enlistment. The flight chief, if designated by the commander, may
       sign as authorizing official or the appropriate designee from the MPS serving the
       recruiter accountable for accession. Upon completion of meaningful training by the
       enlistee, the recruiter signs the AF Form 40A as the certifying official.
5.10. Shipping Considerations. Before enlistment, high school juniors and seniors must
furnish a letter of intent to graduate from their high school indicating their graduation date.
Individuals enlisted as high school juniors or seniors must present their high school diploma
before processing for IADT.
   5.10.1. Before enlistment, high school juniors and seniors must furnish a letter of intent
   to graduate from their high school indicating their graduation date. Individuals enlisted as
   high school juniors or seniors must present their high school diploma before processing for
   IADT.
   5.10.2. DET Members must have accurate BMT/TTS reporting information annotated in
   AFRISS-R before shipping to BMT; this includes Enlistments w/o BMT/TTS dates and Split
 82                                                             AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009


   Tour Option (STO). In addition, all members beginning or waiting to begin Initial Active
   Duty for Training (IADT) regardless if they are DET or not, should not have a pay date
   commensurate with their date of enlistment unless they receive IDT pay (performed no more
   than 1 or 2 periods of IDT in conjunction with their enlistment; 37 U.S.C.) on their date of
   enlistment. Recruiters will utilize the Update BMT Information process for changes and
   updates while in DET. Ensure Enlistments w/o BMT/TTS date information is uploaded
   within 3 business days from receipt from HQ AFRC/AIKE
5.11. Delayed Entry into Training (DET) Management.
   5.11.1. The DET Management Policy (formerly referred to as DEP or Delayed Entry
   Program) is designed to assist recruiters in successfully following up on their NPS enlistees
   awaiting Basic Military Training (BMT). This program provides continuity in program
   management and allows for in-depth documented follow-up. All information maintained on
   member’s disposition and contacts will be conducted utilizing Outreach functions (i.e. face-
   to-face, phone, e-mail, etc.) within AFRISS-R as a running log until ship date. This
   documentation must present a vivid “word picture” of all events/conversations The following
   procedures outline requirements for use and implementation.
   5.11.2. It is the recruiter’s responsibility to educate DET members on BMT physical fitness
   requirements and encourage them to establish and conduct individual training activities that
   prepare them to successfully meet these requirements. You must not administer any fitness
   training to any DET member. A height and weight check is required for each DET member
   monthly. Annotate these results in the remarks section on the DET checklist. Any member
   found to be over their maximum allowable weight (MAW) MUST be sent for appropriate
   Body Fat Measurement (BFM) to determine eligibility
      5.11.2.1. DELETED
      5.11.2.2. Copy 2 will be attached to the Accession Data Sheet (ADS) for filing in the
      Flight Office file plan.
      5.11.2.3. DELETED
   5.11.3. DET members must meet face-to-face with a recruiter at least once a month. If
   unique circumstances exist where no AFRCRS recruiter (OA/line/ISR/HP) resides within 50-
   miles of applicant, or recruiter is unable to fulfill DET requirements, please contact RSOO
   for exception consideration. Recruiters must still have some type of documented contact
   (preferably telephone) with DET members every 2 weeks. Annotate these comments
   utilizing the Outreach function in AFRISS-R accordingly. (Per AFRCI 36-2001 Para. 5.11.
   Post-enlistment Follow-up).
   5.11.4. DET members are required to answer DET Checklist questions contained in
   AFRISS-R each month until they depart for BMT. The DET Checklist will be used by
   recruiters to ensure members are questioned thoroughly on issues that may alter their
   eligibility to ship. It also contains a guide for departure (preferably during last 2 weeks
   before member ships). Any problems/issues/concerns identified on the DET Checklist
   require appropriate comments in the remarks section for the correlating concern. Recruiters
   must address the problem(s) and provide a solution(s).                Inform your senior
   recruiter/supervisor if problems exist. This will ensure problems are addressed as soon as
   possible to prevent shipping delays
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                     83


  5.11.5. Flight Chiefs: are required to validate DET member qualifications prior to shipping
  to BMT. Once a DET member is within 45 days of BMT report, the member’s file will be
  sent (auto-system generated) to your actions pending folder. At that time, you will be
  required to complete the DET Checklist; this action must be accomplished before you can
  gain the member. Note: Flight Chiefs have the option to complete the DET Checklist as often
  as needed and recommend the DET Checklist be utilized when problems are elevated to you
  for resolution.
  5.11.6. Keep reinforcing the member’s decision to join. Adherence to this guidance
  promotes a state of awareness of the DET member and reduces chances of incurring a loss
  prior to, or during BMT/TTS.
  5.11.7. It is your responsibility to ensure that the members of your DET are aware of all
  physical fitness requirements prior to departure for Basic Military Training. It is your
  responsibility to educate members in the DET on BMT physical fitness requirements and
  encourage them to establish and conduct individual training activities preparing them to
  successfully meet the requirements. Recruiters will not administer any fitness training to any
  DET member. You are required to perform height and weight checks on each DET member
  monthly and annotate the results in applicant Outreaches and DET Sign in Log. This Sign in
  Log will be turned into your Flight Chief each month. Any member found to be over their
  maximum allowable weight (MAW) MUST be sent for appropriate body fat measurement
  (BFM).
  5.11.8. DELETED
  5.11.9. Any problems/issues that are identified on the DET Worksheet should be annotated
  on the Monthly Shipper Validation Report (see Located on CoP). You need to address not
  only the problem but also provide a solution. This report will be turned in monthly to your
  flight chief/supervisor if problems exist. This will ensure problems are addressed as soon as
  possible to prevent a delay in shipping.

       occurs when the AF Form 1288 is turned in for a gain to the MPS.
   6.6.3. Applicants assigned to ARPC with less than 3 months (2 years for ART applicants)
   remaining in their current enlistment or MSO cannot be reassigned to the Ready Reserve
   unless they elect discharge to immediately reenlist under AFI 36-2612, United States Air
   Force Reserve Reenlistment and Retention Program.
       6.6.3.1. If an applicant from the IRR or ANG has less that 90 days remaining on their
       current enlistment, the Air Force Reserve recruiter will accomplish a DD Form 4 and
       complete the enlistment. For unit gains, the original DD Form 4 must be sent to the
       gaining MPS. For IMAs, the DD Form 4 must be forwarded to HQ ARPC/RSOO. This
       action will still be considered an assignment action for accession purposes.

       endorsement using the information contained in RMVS, or telephonically, and forwards
       one copy to the gaining MPS. One copy is placed in the working case file by the ISR and
       one copy is sent to the active duty MPS Separations Unit to initiate the assignment.
6.7. Palace Front Actions. Flight Chiefs are responsible to ensure that recruiters under their
control who perform ISR duties process their applicants according to AFI 36-3205, Applying for
the Palace Chase and Palace Front Programs and as directed by AFRCRS/CC guidance.

   6.7.2. PS Air Force personnel being discharged may be enlisted into the Non-obligated
   Nonparticipating Ready Reserve Section (NNRPS) if they are unable to obtain a paid reserve
   position.
       6.7.2.1. Applicants must meet mandatory enlistment qualifications and be processed

                 OFFICER ACCESSION COMMISSIONING PROGRAMS

8.1. Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to provide procedures for potential health
professionals and officer accessions for the AFR. AFI 36-2005 is the source publication for all
appointments and AFI 36-2115 is the source publication for assignments. This chapter provides
basic guidance with specific references.
8.2. Program Overview. Health Profession (HP), Physician and Officer Accession (OA)
recruiters are responsible for all officer recruiting. ISRs are responsible for the assignment of all
officers separating ADAF except Medical Corps and Dental Corps
8.3. ARC Incentive Programs. Air Reserve Component (ARC) Incentive Programs directed
towards health professionals include the HP Ready Reserve Stipend Program (HPRRSP), the
Special Pay Incentive (SPI) Program, and the HP Loan Repayment Program (HPLRP).
   8.3.1. The Health Professions and Officer Accessions Program Manager (AFRCRS/RSOO)
   provides specific incentive program guidance, program parameters, and a listing of eligible
   specialties for all specialized recruiting programs directed towards health professional or
   officer candidates.
8.4. Initial Interview and Qualification Procedures. Recruiters will follow the initial
interview and qualification procedures shown in Chapter 3 of this instruction. Ensure applicants
meet eligibility criteria set forth in AFI 36-2005, Table 2.2. Use the current ADR, for all health
profession and officer applicants.
8.5. Processing Applications. Initial interview and tentative qualification must take place
before any processing begins.
   8.5.1. Give all HP applicants a Medical Officer Applicant Worksheet, AFRC Form 136,
   upon initial interview. The commissioning application must be completed according to the
   requirements of AFI 36-2005, Chapter 3.

   SharePoint (AFRCRS/Physician/Health Professions) or for OA applicants refer to checklist
   in AFRCI 36-2602, Table 1 to properly complete the case file.
   8.5.3. Send completed appointment applications and assignment actions to the flight chief or
   designated official for quality review. A thorough QC by the flight chief or the designated
   representative on every appointment or assignment case file is mandatory prior to the
   accession.
   8.5.4. The flight chief will send a transmittal letter with applications to the selection
   authority. This letter may provide pertinent information concerning the application (e.g. any
   items or documents that might not be available at the time of submission and when and from
   whom they may be expected, requesting special instructions concerning tendering the oath of
   office, identifying disqualifications and requests for waivers, any additional information
   concerning the waiver request, information about how the recruiter may be contacted
   concerning the application, etc.).
 96                                                                 AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009


   8.5.5. The flight chief forwards the application to the appropriate approving authority. For
   IMA applications, AFRCRS/RSOI attaches the Health Professions Tracking Sheet to the
   application and forwards the application to the selection authority. The selection authority
   and/or ARPC/DPAAA will contact the flight chief for application issues/discrepancies found
   during the process.
   8.5.6. ARPC/DPAAA notifies the recruiter and the applicant when tendering an oath of
   office. Recruiters must urge the applicant to complete the oath of office and return the
   original oath to ARPC/DPAAA within the time constraints listed on the tender oath letter.
   For recruiter-controlled accessions, the recruiter must ensure the applicant completes a DD
   Form 93 and VASGLV 8286 concurrently with the oath of office. Keep these documents
   with the application residual file until the applicant in-processes into their unit of assignment.
   8.5.7. Recruiters keep a residual copy of the entire application until the applicant is
   appointed, disqualified, or become NLI. After appointment, the recruiter may forward copies
   of the application to the appointed individual. ADSs on individuals who have been accessed,
   disqualified or become NLI are forwarded to the flight chief’s OL for proper disposition.
8.6. Basic Eligibility. Applicants must meet all eligibility requirements identified in AFI 36-
2005, AFOCD and AFI 36-2101. Meeting commissioning qualifications does not guarantee
acceptance. Unqualified applicants will be tactfully dismissed.
   8.6.1. Waiver procedures and waiver authorities are outlined in AFI 36-2005, Chapter 2.
   Forward all waiver requests with the completed appointment application. In questionable
   cases, recruiters may forward appropriate documentation to AFRCRS/RSOO for review and
   consultation with selection authorities before an entire application is completed.
8.7. CCMAPPEDDS. Recruiters will utilize the AFR recruiting CCMAPPEDDS prescreening

   is the responsibility of the MPS serving the recruiter accountable for accession. Coordination
   will be completed and package returned to the recruiter as soon as possible but no longer than
   24 hours from receipt. The flight chief or designated representative will coordinate with the
   MPS for:
       9.3.2.1. Authorization of the AF Form 40a when required for NPS Initial IDT period,
       unless Flight Chief has been given authority and authorization via the Wing Commander

     consummated. Take immediate corrective action as applicable.
        9.3.3.1. Completed unit enlistment case files must arrive at the servicing MPS within 24
        hours from the date of enlistment and 5 workdays for satellite recruiting locations. IMA

                                             Chapter 10

                                   WAIVERS AND REVIEWS

10.1. Waiver and Review Guidance. Waivers/reviews allow disqualified applicants an
opportunity to be considered under the "whole person" concept, when circumstances clearly
justify a waiver or review. The following paragraphs provide general guidance. Refer to the
specific criteria and Table 10.1 for complete waiver/review criteria guidance.
10.2. Justification to Submit. Recruiters may submit requests only when other indicators such
as test results, qualifications, previous service, etc., clearly indicate that a waiver is appropriate,
and is in the best interest of the AFR. If this is not the case, tactfully dismiss the disqualified
applicant.
10.3. Enlistment Reviews. Enlistment reviews address criteria involving family care, military
image, medical and AFSC reviews.
10.4. General Information. Waiver/review requests must be processed through appropriate
recruiting channels. Applicants with more than one waiver action found in Table 10.1, must be
submitted to the approval authority at the same time. If the final approval authority is at the wing
commander level, obtain approval for these waiver/reviews before submitting additional waiver/
reviews to higher headquarters. Final approval authority for waivers/reviews is shown in Table
10.1. Further delegation is not authorized.
   10.4.1. A master records purge must be conducted before the waiver is submitted on
   applicants having an RE/SPD code or discharge, which is a bar to enlistment. The recruiter
   requests the master records purge with all appropriate sources using the SF 180, Request
   Pertaining to Military Records. Specifically request the following documents: DD Forms
   214/215, NGB Forms 22, discharge orders, any derogatory information, Article 15s,
   Captain’s Masts, Letters of Reprimand, and performance reports.
   10.4.2. Approved waivers/reviews are valid for 1 year from the date of approval, unless
   otherwise indicated. Do not give a copy of the waiver or review to the applicant.
       10.4.2.1. Any potentially disqualifying information received after submitting the
       waiver/review will be immediately reported to the approval authority. Cease all
       processing and contact AFRCRS/RSOO for guidance.
       10.4.2.2. Following waiver/review approval, if the applicant is enlisting into an AFSC,
       which is different than the projected AFSC, which appeared on the Waiver Process form,
       the flight chief must coordinate this change with the approval authority. This does not
       pertain to a change in the skill level indicator.
       10.4.2.3. After receiving a waiver or enlistment review approval, the recruiter may
       consummate the enlistment (provided the applicant is otherwise qualified).
10.5. Medical Waivers. Waivers to medical standards will be approved only by or through HQ
AFRC/SGP (for unit and Individual Mobilization Augmentees).
   10.5.1. Minimum height for accession is 58 inches. Waivers below 58 inches may be
   requested through HQ AFRC/SGP. Necessary medical evaluations must be accomplished
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                      109


   before submission. MEPS or RMUs do not have authority to approve sub-standard height
   waivers for flying class III examinees or Air Force commissioning applicants. These waivers
   are granted on a case-by-case basis. Contact AFRCRS/RSOO for guidance.
   10.5.2. If a Military Treatment Facility (MTF) or MEPS recommends a medical waiver in
   writing, the recruiter has no discretion in the matter; the waiver must be submitted unless the
   applicant is ineligible for some other reason. Flight chiefs may request a medical waiver,
   without a MTF or MEPS recommendation if they determine unusual circumstances warrant
   consideration by the appropriate AFR physical standards OPR. Process these types of waiver
   requests as follows:
       10.5.2.1. For unit accessions the local RMU reviews the physical and annotates the DD
       Form 2807-2, if it is determined a request for a HQ AFRC/SGP waiver is warranted.
       Additionally, if there are indications the applicant may be medically restricted to certain
       duties, the gaining wing commander must annotate acceptance of the applicant for
       affiliation.
           10.5.2.1.1. Forward the medical waiver request to AFRCRS/RSOO for HQ
           AFRC/SG approval/disapproval.
       10.5.2.2. For Individual Reserve Program accessions contact AFRCRS/RSOI who
       coordinates with HQ AFRC/SGP to determine if a request for review is warranted.
           10.5.2.2.1. Forward the medical waiver request to AFRCRS/RSOI for HQ
           AFRC/SGP approval/disapproval.
10.6. Classification Waivers. Only factors that warrant exceptional consideration may be
waived.
10.7. Assignment Waivers. Members of the ANG or IRR who have conditions of ineligibility
for assignment (e.g., Assignment Action Reason, RE code, character of service, etc.) must have
assignment waivers approved prior to further processing. This is not an enlistment waiver. The
recruiter may submit a fully supported assignment waiver only at the applicant's request. Follow
the guidance in Table 10.1, Rule 26 and AFI 36-2115, Assignments Within The Reserve
Components and notify AFRCRS/RSOI if disqualified or the waiver is disapproved. HQ ARPC
will identify the individual in the Military Personnel Data System (MilPDS) by assigning an
assignment availability code that determines the member’s eligibility for continued service in the
AFR.
   10.7.1. Unit assignment waivers are processed as follows:
       10.7.1.1. The recruiter initiates the waiver by annotating the 1st endorsement of AF
       Form 1288, tentatively blocks the position in RMVS, and obtains the gaining unit
       commander’s (or designated official’s) endorsement. The recruiter forwards the package
       to the servicing MPS for coordination to HQ AFRC/A1E.
   10.7.2. Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) assignment waivers are processed as
   follows:
       10.7.2.1. Recruiter initiates waiver by annotating the 1st endorsement of AF Form 1288,
       or by letter requesting an assignment waiver, tentatively blocks the position in RMVS,
       and obtains the gaining IMAPM (or designated official) endorsement. The IMA PM
       forwards assignment and waiver request to HQ RMG for approval/disapproval. HQ RMG
 110                                                               AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009


       notifies the IMAPM of the waiver status and process assignment if approved. The IMA
       PM then notifies recruiter of approval and assignment. The IMAPM then notifies
       recruiter of approval and assignment.
   10.7.3. Officers with RegAF or reserve appointments, who were non-selected for promotion
   on the Active Duty List (ADL) for the second time (2x deferred), are ineligible for accession
   to a SelRes position without a waiver according to AFI 36-2005 (RegAF), Table 2.2, Rule
   25, or AFI 36-2115. AFI 36-2005 or AFI 36-2115 are the governing directives. AFRCI 36-
   2001 only provides the recruiting process to request a waiver to the 2x deferred ineligibility
   condition.
10.8. IMA AFSC Waiver. The IMA program is primarily composed of individuals with prior
service experience. An enlisted applicant must have a 5-skill level or higher to be eligible. In
some cases, prior service applicants may require an AFSC Review for the potential award of a
skill level for the assigned duty AFSC. An AFSC review allows an exception to authorize award
of an AFSC skill level to prior service applicants with military or civilian education, training, or
experience directly relating to an AFS. All such reviews will be in accordance with the direction
of AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). See Table 10.1, Rule 29
for waiver requirements.
   10.8.1. Follow blocking procedures according to standards set by RSOI and the IMA
   Handbook, ensure the Program Manager knows an AFSC Determination is required.
   Annotate "AFSC determination is required" in the remarks section of the RMVS blocking
   screen. If any other waivers or reviews are required, specify which type. Include this
   information and the requested AFSC on the AF Form 1288.
       10.8.1.1. Forward the AFSC Waiver or Review request directly to HQ RMG/DPMT.
       10.8.1.2. The MAJCOM Functional Manager’s review is conducted and the
       determination is returned to RSOO.
10.9. Mandatory Formal Technical Schools. HQ AFRC/A1E may approve waiver of
mandatory technical schools when the individual has other training or experience, which may be
applied to the training requirement.
   10.9.1. A technical adviser for the requested AFS conducts the evaluation on subject and
   task knowledge levels as required by the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP).
   The CFETP must show date completed, technical adviser’s initials, and the applicant’s
   initials certifying 3-skill level task completion.
       10.9.1.1. Applicants will not demonstrate performance level tasks. Performance task
       items may be certified (by the technical adviser) if the applicant provides documentation
       (certificates, licenses, letters, etc.) showing the applicant previously performed these
       tasks.
10.10. Enlistment Waiver/Review for Family Care. The Wing Commander (to include the
Group Commander for GSUs) is the approval authority for all enlistment family care waivers.
Delegation is authorized at the discretion of Wing/Group commanders. Family Care
Waivers/Financial Reviews must be approved prior to submission of any additional
determinations or reviews that require higher headquarter approval. Contact AFRCRS/RSOO on
questionable cases. See Tables 3.19 and 10.1 for family care determinations criteria.
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                    111


   10.10.1. An enlistment waiver for family care is required regardless of whether or not the
   applicant has custody of family members (to include illegitimate children) incapable of self-
   care. Circumstances may change, and the applicant must provide a plan for family member
   care with every enlistment waiver for family care. The AF Form 357, Family Care
   Certification, is used for this purpose. Complete Sections I and II of the AF Form 357. See
   AFI 36-2908 for additional guidance.
10.11. After-the-Fact Waivers. These waivers will be considered for reserve members in DEP,
attending BMT/TTS or STO members awaiting TTS seats. Process these waivers manually. The
Wing Commander (to include Group Commander for GSUs) is the approval authority.
Delegation is authorized at the discretion of Wing/Group commanders.
10.12. Waiver and Review Table. Table 10.1 provides requirements and processing guidance
for waivers and reviews. All waivers/reviews will be forwarded through, and authorized by the
flight chief prior to processing outside of the OL.

Table 10.1. Waiver and Review Requirements.

NOTES:
1. The entire request for waiver is categorized as sensitive data and must be marked and treated
as such. Mark each page of the request at the top and bottom "Sensitive Data-Unauthorized
Access Prohibited by Public Law 92-255." A rubber stamp is authorized for this purpose. The
entire request is then placed in a plain envelope marked in the same manner, sealed, and placed
in another outer, sealed envelope, which is not marked except for the address.
2. Reproduced copies of USCIS I-Form 551 are authorized for official government use.
3. Special 2-week orientations do not count as a recognized BMT. NPS applicants who have not
completed a recognized BMT will be required to attend Air Force BMT.
4. If the applicant is married to a military member annotate the spouses rank, component, AFSC/MOS, total
military service time, duty location, and time on station on the AFRC Form 72, applicant’s statement section
5. If RE or SPD code reflects a medical condition, submit a waiver using Rule 15. If RE or SPD
code reflects separation under the weight management program, submit a waiver using this rule
and include a height and weight/BFM statement. Separation under the weight management
program is an administrative discharge, not a medical discharge. If RE or SPD reflects hardship
based on family care an enlistment waiver may be required and processed prior to submission of
the RE/SPD code waiver.
6. The authority shown is recruiting point of contact. The actual final approval authority is:
Rule 11 (Unit Program) Appropriate Air Force Career Field Manager for requested AFS.

Rule 24 (Unit Program) Appropriate Air Force Career Field Manager for requested AFS.
Rule 28 (IMA Program) HQ ARPC Military Training.
7. When the final authority is the Wing/CC, this refers to the gaining Wing/CC (unit enlistment)
or RMG/CC (IMA enlistment) and recommendation is required.
8. Recruiters may take these photographs provided the tattoo/brand is visible while the applicant
is fully clothed. Conservative shorts and short-sleeved shirts are acceptable. Recruiters are not
permitted to take these photographs in any other circumstances. Mature judgment will be
exercised in these sensitive situations.
9. Waivers of medical standards must include duty title of the AFSC, a brief description of the
actual duties the applicant will perform, and the type of environment the applicant will be
working in. EXAMPLE: office, flight line, firing range, etc. The gaining MPS Personnel
Employment Element will provide this information to the recruiter, upon the recruiter's request.
This additional requirement applies to Category A unit accessions only.
10. The AFRC Form 72a is prepared at the Flight Office for all waivers/reviews for which the
wing commander is the approval authority. AFRCRS/RSOO or AFRCRS/RSOI prepares the
AFRC Form 72a for all waivers/reviews forwarded through their respective offices.
11. ANG has the authority to discharge members (for unsatisfactory participation – giving them a
general discharge) from their state enlistment and assign them to the IRR under their remaining
federal obligations. Other guard and reserve components have also exercised this action. These
are the only circumstances under AFR accession standards where a general discharge may be
waived. The gaining wing commander or RMG/CC (as applies) recommendation is required. If
the individual holds AFR IRR status – see Rule 25.
12. Waiver to remove weight management code that is a bar to assignment will include only the
following documents: Current height and weight statement, BFM and AF Form 1288 with Wing
CC’s endorsement.
13. Individuals who were assigned to the IRR with a code for pregnancy require a waiver to
remove the code. Provide only the following documents: Statement of uncomplicated pregnancy,
approval for worldwide duty and current height and weight statement. EXCEPTION: Persons
under 6 months post- delivery are deferred from meeting height and weight standards.
14. 2T231 Classification Waivers should focus on the justification for bringing quality personnel
into the aerial port units and not solely on ASVAB scores. Thus, aerial port commanders or
designated representatives must interface with the recruiters and become proactive in their
screening process to ensure personnel who do not meet the current mechanical score, can fit into
their organizations without creating undue training deficiencies. Comments must be placed on
AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet. Unit commanders must interview potential candidates and
initiate the waiver request if appropriate. They should provide comments why an individual who
does not meet the required composite score would be a solid candidate for waiver consideration
into the aerial port career field. Include supporting documentation i.e., education, civilian
employment, and other experience, as appropriate.

Terms
Air Force Officer Qualifying Test (AFOQT)—A written test administered to applicants who
are applying for certain commissioning programs. Test results are used for qualification and
classification and it consists of five parts: Pilot, Navigator, Academic Aptitude, Verbal, and
Quantitative.
Air Force Ready Reserve Stipend Program (AFRRSP)—A program in which selected health
professionals may receive a monthly stipend while in training for agreeing to participate in the
Air Force Reserve upon completion of training.
Air Reserve Components (ARC)—All units, organizations, and members of the Air National
Guard of the United States and the Air Force Reserve. This item is not used to identify an Air
Force component or organization. (Also known as the Air Reserve Forces).
Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC)—A MAJCOM direct reporting unit of HQ Air Force
Reserve Command. Administers the personnel management and mobilization of individual Air
Force reservists not assigned to units or on extended active duty. Maintains the master personnel
records for all members of the Air Reserve Components who are not on extended active duty.
Air Reserve Technician (ART)—A civilian employee of the United States Air Force Reserve
who provides permanent support to a USAFR unit and occupies a comparable Reserve unit
manpower document (UMD) military position in the unit in which employed.
Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB)—A battery (or series) of 10 tests,
administered to an enlisted program applicant. ASVAB results are used to qualify and classify
applicants for enlistment and skill training.   The ASVAB provides grades in five areas:
Mechanical (M), Administrative (A), General (G), Electronic (E), and the Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT) score.
Basic Attributes Test (BAT)—A written test administered to applicants who are applying for
rated officer training programs.
Central Managers (formerly Single Managers)—Central Managers are selected HQ RMG
Detachments that have selection and hiring authority to manage their respective Individual
Reserve Program. Central Managers include Chaplain (RMG Det 13), Judge Advocate (HQ
RMG Det 14), Surgeon General (RMG Det 15), Intel (RMG Det 6), and AF Office of Special
Investigations (AFOSI) (RMG Det 5). For accession purposes, Central Managers grant AFR
recruiters the authority to access IMA applicants into the Central Manager’s program (if
otherwise qualified).
Conviction or Adverse Adjudication—For the purpose of determining accession eligibility,
concern is with the conviction or final adjudication and not the actual charge.
Conviction—A conviction is the act of finding a person guilty of a crime, offense, or other
violation of the law by a court, judge, or other authorized adjudication authority (this includes
fines and forfeiture of bond in lieu of trial).
Adverse Adjudication—An adverse adjudication (adult or juvenile) is any finding, decision,
sentence, or judgment other than dropped, dismissed, pardoned, or acquitted with no conditions
or restraint attached. If the adjudication authority places a condition or restraint leading to
dismissal, dropped charges, or takes any other action indicating the authority believes the person
to be guilty of the offense, then the adjudication is adverse. Suspension of sentence, pardon, or
 126                                                               AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009


dismissal after compliance with court-imposed conditions does not alleviate the conviction or
adverse adjudication.
Documented Offenses—Offenses that are a matter of official record with entities such as police
agencies, criminal courts, probation offices, and the National Crime Information Center (NCIC).
Youth Offenders (YO) adjudications and sealed or expunged records are also a matter of official
record and considered documented offenses, even though subsequent police, court, and probation
office record checks may come back labeled "no record," "YO," "sealed record," or "expunged.
Disposition—Final disposition for a given charge should reflect the date and specific charge
against the person and exact sentence, fine, decision, or adjudication of the court, judge, or other
authorized adjudication authority. "No Record" is not a disposition. If disposition is unavailable
to the recruiter through normal procedures, the burden of proof falls on the applicant.
Administrative Punishment—Actions typically imposed in the military by a commander or
supervisor in a face-to-face setting with a member in his or her chain of command for minor
infractions of rules, procedures, or other directives. They include oral and written counseling,
admonitions, reprimands, and the like. They may or may not lead to the establishment of an
Unfavorable Information File (UIF), usually based upon a separate decision of the commander or
supervisor.
Non-judicial Military Justice Action—A term used to exclusively refer to a non-judicial ("not
in a court-martial") punishment action under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ) for an alleged, criminal offense under the UCMJ. It is often called "an Article 15" (in
the Navy, called a "Captain’s Mast"). Only a commander may impose punishment under Article
15 and then only after advising the alleged offender of specific rights, including the right to
consult a lawyer and the right to decline punishment under Article 15 and demand a trial
by court—martial. An acceptance of Article 15 processing by the alleged offender is not
necessarily an admission of guilt (though the offender’s response may admit the offense.)
Acceptance by the alleged offender of Article 15 processing and/or the imposition of punishment
by the commander does not constitute a "criminal conviction." Imposition of non-judicial
punishment by the commander indicates that the commander concluded the member committed
the offense.
Judicial Military Justice Action—Exclusively refers to trial by court-martial (that is, a
"summary court-martial", "special court-martial", or "general court-martial"). Like Article 15
processing, courts-martial may only be convened to consider guilt or innocence of alleged
criminal offenses. Most (but not all) convictions at a trial by court-martial constitute a "criminal
conviction."
Restraint—Restraint means court imposed restrictions such as confinement, suspended sentence
of confinement, parole, probation, or work details. In addition, restraint is any type of pretrial
restriction imposed by the court or by agreement with authorities. (NOTE: The following are
not considered forms of restraint: a) A fine, whether or not suspended; b) An unconditional
suspended sentence not involving confinement; c) Unsupervised unconditional probation.)
Self-Admitted Offenses—Offenses voluntarily disclosed by applicants revealing they were
never actually caught, arrested, or otherwise exposed to formal civilian or military legal
proceedings. These offenses can also be disclosed by applicants where legal proceedings took
place but the records may have been destroyed, expunged or unavailable.
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                      127


Unconditional Suspended Sentence and Unsupervised Unconditional Probation—Any
suspended sentence or probationary status imposed by a criminal or juvenile court that places no
conditions upon the individual: a) Regarding freedom of movement; b) Requiring the payment
of damage (upon payment, the condition would not be disqualifying); c) Requiring periodic
reporting by the applicant to an officer of the court (to include a probation officer).
CCMAPPEDDS—A recruiting acronym used as a tool, which identifies essential areas of an
applicant’s background that must be reviewed by the recruiter to determine initial eligibility
before processing for the AFR. This acronym is used to prescreen all AFR applicants prior to
any processing. Each area may have a direct bearing on the applicant’s initial qualification for
application. These areas are: Conscientious Objector, Citizenship, Moral conduct, Age, Prior
service, Physical condition, Education, Dependent status, Drugs and SSN, and (as it applies,
e.g. HP recruiting, etc.) Service credit.
Conscientious Objector—-An individual who has, or ever had, a firm, fixed, and sincere
objection to participation in war in any form or to the performance of military service because of
religious or moral beliefs.
Alcohol Abuse—Alcohol use confirmed by competent medical authority that the individual is
emotionally, mentally, or physically dependent on alcohol. NOTE: When not confirmed by
medical authority, self-admitted alcohol use that leads to a person’s misconduct or unacceptable
behavior, to the impairment of work performance, physical or mental health, financial
responsibility or personal relationships, must be reported during the medical examination for
determination of alcohol abuse.
Drug Abuse—The illegal, wrongful, or improper use of marijuana, any narcotic substance,
hallucinogens, or any dangerous drug.
Experimental Use—Using illegal drugs not more than once or twice for reasons of curiosity,
peer pressure, or similar reasons. See chapter 4 for experimental use of marijuana guidance.
Illegal Drugs—Any drug or narcotic that is habit forming or has a potential for abuse because of
its stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect. Includes cocaine, crack, hallucinogens, (to
include lysergic acid diethyamide (LSD), phenenocyclidine (PCP), tetrahydrocannabinal (THC)
in non-marijuana form, and others, opium, morphine, heroin, dilaudid, codeine, Demerol,
inhalants (paint, glue, and others), amphetamines (speed), methamphetamines (ice), barbiturates
(downers), and anabolic steroids.
Marijuana—The intoxicating products of the hemp plant, to include hashish and all natural
derivatives of cannabis sative.
Supplier, Distributor or Trafficker—One who illegally, wrongfully, or improperly delivers
any of the drugs defined above to the possession of another.           This includes the actual,
constructive, or attempted transfer of an item, whether or not an agency relationship exists. This
also includes the cultivation or manufacture of any drug described above.

performs the pre-accession processing of an applicant and subsequently turns the applicant over
to the MPS (or SPA) for the actual enlistment or appointment oath. Because the MPS must be
ready to administer the oath of enlistment/appointment to the applicant and perform post-
accession processing, they control the timing of the actual enlistment/appointment. Although

PALACE CHASE (PC)—The PALACE CHASE program allows eligible officers and enlisted
personnel on active duty to waive their remaining active duty service commitment (ADSC) or

AFI 36-3205, Applying for the Palace Chase and Palace Front Programs.
PALACE FRONT (PF)—The PALACE FRONT program allows eligible officers and enlisted
personnel on active duty, to concurrently enlist or be assigned into the SelRes upon completion
of their ADSC or at their DOS. Guidance for this program is contained in AFI 36-3205,

made up of line officers and enlisted members unable to find a vacancy in a pay category.
Members must have an approved training attachment and earn a minimum of 35 non-paid points
through non-paid Inactive Duty Training (IDT) and Extension Course Institute (ECI) courses.
Participation is mandatory, and limited to a maximum of 3 years.
Ready Reserve—The Ready Reserve consists of two major subdivisions, the Selected Reserve
and the Individual Ready Reserve.

IADT.
Individual Ready Reserve (IRR)—The IRR primarily consists of ready reservists not assigned
to a unit or IMA position. The IRR is subdivided into four sections: the Obligated Reserve
Section (ORS); the Ready Reinforcement Personnel Section (RRPS); the Non-obligated
Nonparticipating Ready Reserve Section (NNRPS); mobilization filler resources in the Air
Reserve Squadrons (ARS).
Recruiter Controlled Accessions—An accession in which an Air Force Reserve recruiter fully
controls all aspects of the accession process. This control includes the timing, location and
duration of pre- accession processing as well as the actual enlistment or appointment. When
performing Recruiter Controlled Accessions, AFR recruiters must ensure additional forms
(which are normally performed by personnel technicians during MPS Controlled Accessions) are
completed EXAMPLE: VASGLV 8286, Servicemen’s Group Life Insurance Election and
Certificate, DD Form 93 and (for NPS enlistments only) the AF Form 40A. Following a
Recruiter Controlled Accession of a NPS applicant, the recruiter is responsible to supervise the
enlistee’s initial 4-hour IDT period. The recruiter is also responsible for signing the AF Form
40A certifying that the training was actually performed.
Residency Post—medical specialty training; does not include internship year.
Satisfactory Service Satisfactory—Service includes both the service one performs as a member
of a regular component or as a member of a guard or reserve unit, (50 or more points per year are

who qualify for appointment and agree to serve for a specified period of time in designated
critical specialties, may receive a money bonus.
Student Testing Program—This program allows students the opportunity to take the ASVAB.
The student version of the ASVAB is administered on campus and is normally given to high
school students, although it may be given at other schools. The student-testing program comes
under the operational control of HQ USMEPCOM and is supported by the recruiting commands

        RESTRICTIONS ON PERSONAL CONDUCT IN THE ARMED FORCES

A4.1. Policy Background. Military life is fundamentally different from civilian life. The
military has its own laws, rules, customs and traditions, including numerous restrictions on
personal behavior that would not be acceptable in civilian society. These are necessary because
military units and personnel must maintain the high standards of morale, good order and
discipline, and unit cohesion that are essential for combat effectiveness.
   A4.1.1. The Armed Forces must be ready at all times for world-wide deployment. Military
   law and regulations, including the Uniform Code of Military Justice, apply to service
   members at all times, both on base or off base, from the time the member enters the Service
   until the member is discharged or otherwise separated from the Armed Forces.

               APPLICANT BRIEFING ITEM ON SEPARATION POLICY

A5.1. As military members, you occupy a unique position in society. You represent the military
establishment. This special status brings with it the responsibility to uphold and maintain the
dignity and high standards of the U.S. Armed Forces at all times and in all places. The Armed
Forces must also be ready at all times for world-wide deployment. This fact carries with it the
requirements for military units and their members to possess high standards of morale, good
order and discipline, and cohesion. As a result, military laws, rules, customs and traditions
include restrictions on your personal behavior that may be different from civilian life. Members
of the Armed Forces may be involuntarily separated before their enlistment or term of service
ends for various reasons established by law and military regulations. Some unacceptable conduct
may be grounds for involuntary separation, such as:
   A5.1.1. You establish a pattern of disciplinary infractions, discreditable involvement with
   civil or military authorities or you cause dissent, or disrupt or degrade the mission of your
   unit. This may also include conduct of any nature that would bring discredit on the Armed
   Forces in the view of the civilian community.
   A5.1.2. Because of parental responsibilities, you are unable to perform your duties
   satisfactorily or you are unavailable for worldwide assignment or deployment.
   A5.1.3. You fail to meet the Fit to Fight standards.

military service. You may, however, be disciplined.
A5.4. The Armed Services do not tolerate harassment or violence against any service member,
for any reason.

 AFR ACCESSION SCREENING POLICY FOR GOVERNMENT TRAVEL CHARGE
                  CARD MISUSE AND DELINQUENCY

A7.1. Implementation. The AFRC Vice Commander directed implementation of an accession
screening policy to identify an applicant’s history of misuse or delinquency of the government
travel charge card. This screening policy applies to all categories of AFRC recruiter accessions.
The DoD FMR Volume 9, Chapter 3, Travel Policy and Procedures, provides additional
reference and guidance. The AFR recruiting government travel charge card screening process is
mandatory for the AFR recruiting interview process.
   A7.1.1. An applicant with a history of misuse or delinquency of the government travel
   charge card is not automatically disqualified for entry to the AFR, if otherwise qualified. No
   waiver is required. The gaining CAT A wing commander, RMG/CC for IMA program, or
   their designated official will review and make the determination to accept the applicant. Non-
   acceptance does not disqualify, nor prevent the applicant from requesting affiliation with any
   other AFR position.
   A7.1.2. The AF Form 1288, Request for Reserve Assignment, will be used for AFR
   recruiter accessions, to include Palace Front, Palace Chase, appointments (from any branch
   or component of service), and ANG or AFR IRR assignments to any SelRes position. The
   DD Form 1966, Record of Military Processing – Armed Forces of the United States, will
   be used for enlistment of applicants whose accession into the AFR does not require an AF
   Form 1288. Annotate the following statements on the statement page of the DD Form 1966,
   as applicable:
       A7.1.2.1. "I certify I have/have not misused any government travel charge card (used for
       other than official government travel), or been seriously delinquent (payments not
       received by card issuer within 60 days from the billing date). I understand if I make a
       fraudulent statement, I am subject to immediate discharge action."
       A7.1.2.2. The applicant will circle the appropriate "have/have not" area of the statement
       and initial above the circled response.
           A7.1.2.2.1. A "have not" response requires no further action. Continue processing the
           applicant if otherwise qualified.
           A7.1.2.2.2. A "have" response requires the applicant to provide a written statement
           detailing the specific misuse or delinquency. Attach the applicant’s statement to the
           AF Form 1288 or DD Form 1966 and forward it to the gaining wing commander or
           RMG/CC, as applicable.
       A7.1.2.3. The gaining wing commander or RMG/CC will make a determination to
       accept the applicant based upon the applicant’s statement, or request a government travel
       charge card history from their servicing agency program coordinator (APC) for review
       and determination.
       A7.1.2.4. The gaining wing commander or RMG/CC will annotate acceptance or non-
       acceptance by endorsing the AF Form 1288 or DD Form 1966. Forms will be returned to
       the recruiter for appropriate action.

  AFR ACCESSION STANDARDS GUIDANCE FOR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
  MISDEMEANOR AMENDMENT TO THE GUN CONTROL ACT FOR MILITARY
                          PERSONNEL

A9.1. Background. Domestic violence plagues American society as a whole. The Department
of Defense is committed to the prevention of domestic violence, and has taken a leadership role
in that critical area. Through the Family Advocacy Program, the military provides a host of
prevention, support, counseling and treatment programs for domestic violence. The Domestic
Violence Misdemeanor Amendment to the Gun Control Act for Military Personnel further
enhances the DoD’s efforts to prevent domestic violence.
   A9.1.1. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy ASD/FMP issued
   DoD Interim Policy on 22 Oct 97 for implementation of the Domestic Violence
   Misdemeanor Amendment to the Gun Control Act (Lautenberg Amendment) for all military
   personnel. This amendment makes it a felony for anyone who has been convicted of a
   misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms or
   ammunition. It is also a felony for any person to sell or otherwise dispose a firearm to any
   person so convicted. The law pertains to anyone who has ever been convicted of a domestic
   violence misdemeanor.
A9.2. The Policy Applies To applicants with a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction,
including convictions which occurred prior to or after 30 Sep 96 (passage of the law date). Use
the following for accession purposes:
   A9.2.1. All active duty, guard or reserve member (active or inactive with status) applicants.
   A9.2.2. All prior service, non-prior service, civilians employee and contractor applicants.
A9.3. The Policy Does Not Apply To— Use the following for accession purposes:
   A9.3.1. Major military weapons systems or "crew served" military weapons and
   ammunitions such as tanks, missiles, aircraft, etc.
A9.4. Policy Exceptions. Use the following for accession purposes:
   A9.4.1. No exceptions or waivers are authorized for non-prior service, initial enlistment,
   direct commission, or entry into a program leading to commission except as follows:
       A9.4.1.1. Active duty, guard, reserve member (active or inactive with status) or prior
       service applicants who received a summary court-martial conviction or imposition of
       non-judicial punishment (Article 15, UCMJ) conviction of a misdemeanor crime of
       domestic violence are exempt from this policy, and are eligible for affiliation to the AFR.
       A9.4.1.2. Non-prior service civilian (to include civilian employee and contractor)
       applicants who have a conviction of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, with
       deferred prosecutions (or similar alternative dispositions) in a civilian court are eligible
       for affiliation to the AFR.
       A9.4.1.3. Individuals who have had the misdemeanor conviction expunged, set aside,
       pardoned or the person has had his or her civil rights restored, unless the terms of the
 144                                                                AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009


       expungement, pardon or restoration of civil rights expressly prohibits the individual from
       possessing firearms or ammunition are eligible for affiliation to the AFR.
A9.5. Explanation of Terms for Domestic Violence. Use the following definitions for
accession purposes:
   A9.5.1. Expungements and Pardons: The process for seeking expungements and pardons
   depends on the jurisdiction that rendered the conviction. If a civilian court issued the
   conviction, state law would address who has the authority to grant an expungement or
   pardon. Recruiting will not be involved. In the military justice system, there is no procedure
   for expunging court-martial records. Convicted service members may seek to have these
   convictions entirely set aside through legal appeals. The President of the United States has
   authority to grant pardons for court-martial convictions.
   A9.5.2. Elements of Conviction for Domestic Violence: All of the following elements are
   necessary to constitute qualifying convictions for the purpose of the firearms restriction in
   the Gun Control Act for Military Personnel:
       A9.5.2.1. The person was convicted of a misdemeanor crime (including convictions by
       special or general courts-martial).
       A9.5.2.2. The offense had as an element the use or attempted use of physical force, or
       threatened use of a deadly weapon.
       A9.5.2.3. The convicted offender was at the time of the offense: A current or former
       spouse, parent or guardian of the victim; a person with whom the victim shared a child in
       common; a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse,
       parent or guardian or a person who was similarly situated to a spouse, parent or guardian
       of the victim.
       A9.5.2.4. The convicted offender was represented by counsel, or knowingly and
       intelligently waived the right to counsel.
       A9.5.2.5. If entitled to have the case tried by jury, the case was actually tried by a jury or
       the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury.
       A9.5.2.6. The conviction has not been expunged or set aside, or the convicted offender
       has not been pardoned for the offense or had civil rights restored, unless a condition of
       the pardon, expungement or restoration of civil rights provides that the person may not
       ship, transport, possess or receive firearms.
A9.6. Questionable Accession Policy Issues. In all questionable cases relating to this
accession standards policy, contact AFRCRS/RSOO for guidance.
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                      145

   GUIDE FOR MEDICAL SCREENING OF APPLICANTS--MEPS AND RESERVE
             MEDICAL UNIT ENTRY PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS

A10.1. Purpose of Screening. This guide is designed to help you screen out those applicants
and DEP members who may or will be unfit for service in the AFR SelRes. By screening your
applicants for medical problems, you should be able to sort out many of the applicants who will
be disqualified. Proper and thorough prescreening may save you a significant amount of time.
Refer to Chapter 3 for basic physical eligibility standards and additional processing guidance.
   A10.1.1. If an applicant reveals a medical condition listed in section A and is projected to
   take a MEPS physical:
       A10.1.1.1. Send the medical records for evaluation by the MEPS medical officer prior to
       scheduling the physical, or
       A10.1.1.2. Use the MEPS "DIAL-A-MEDIC" program to discuss the case with a senior
       medical technician or medical officer.
   A10.1.2. If an applicant reveals a medical condition listed in Section A and is using an
   existing physical or other valid medical document, or is taking a physical examination at a
   facility other than MEPS, then the applicant's medical records must be reviewed by the
   Reserve Medical Unit (RMU) at the location nearest to you. If the medical ART is
   unavailable, or your location does not have one assigned, contact AFRCRS/RSOO, they will
   coordinate your request with HQ AFRC/SG.
A10.2. Basic Processing Guidance. Recruiting personnel will not retain applicant medical
information. Additionally, recruiting personnel will not disqualify an applicant for medical
unfitness unless there is an obvious physical defect known to be a permanent disqualifying
factor, such as a missing limb, RK, etc. Only authorized medical personnel at either MEPS or the
RMU may qualify or disqualify applicants medically for military service.
A10.3. Required Medical Reports:
   A10.3.1. The following conditions require medical reports (documentation from the
   physician, hospital, etc.):
       A10.3.1.1. Almost any surgery other than an uncomplicated appendectomy or hernia
       repair, or ligation of tubes, male or female.
       A10.3.1.2. Absolutely any surgery of the brain, back, spinal cord, chest, upper abdomen,
       pelvis, and joints. A tissue report is required in the case of most biopsies (skin, breast,
       etc.) of tumors and lumps.
       A10.3.1.3. Any history of hospitalization other than the exceptions above even if it was
       only 1 or 2 days for tests.
   A10.3.2. The following conditions (even though not treated in a hospital) require records:
       A10.3.2.1. Asthma at any age.
       A10.3.2.2. Skin diseases other than mild acne and athletes foot.
       A10.3.2.3. Allergies if more than mild.

       A10.3.2.4. Back sprains.
       A10.3.2.5. Severe joint sprains.
       A10.3.2.6. Heart conditions.
       A10.3.2.7. Hepatitis, mononucleosis.
   A10.3.3. The most useful medical records are the hospital records. Generally, they are the
   most easily obtained, of better quality, and are maintained for a longer time. Generally, the
   information needed is:
       A10.3.3.1. Admission/discharge summary.
       A10.3.3.2. Surgeon's report.
       A10.3.3.3. Pathologist's report.
       A10.3.3.4. History and physical.
       A10.3.3.5. X-ray and laboratory reports.
       A10.3.3.6. Physician and/or nurse notes.
   A10.3.4. The standard MEPS request form, if used appropriately, lists the required
   information. Most doctor's letters are inadequate. Be aware that all too many civilian doctors
   are unaware of current regulations, have no concept of what military training and duty is like,
   will be strongly biased in favor of the applicant.
A10.4. Borderline Disqualification. The MEPS medical officer normally gives the motivated
applicant every chance to qualify despite a borderline or technical disqualification; however,
there are many conditions where there is no way to authorize accession.
A10.5. Scheduling Females for Examination . Counsel each female applicant that wearing
underwear (bra and panties) is mandatory when taking a physical. A pelvic and rectal
examination is also required, so try to make sure the applicant is not scheduled during her
menstrual period. A pap smear will not be required if the applicant obtains official lab results
(dated within 12 months) from her physician and hand carries them to the RMU or MEPS for her
physical.
A10.6. Disqualifying Conditions. The following disqualifying conditions may be encountered
during medical prescreening of applicants for accession:
   A10.6.1. Abdomen and Digestive System:
       A10.6.1.1. Gallbladder removed and symptoms continue or special diet is required.
       A10.6.1.2. Gallstones, current.

     DATE AND AGE COMPUTATIONS FOR PRIOR SERVICE (PS) ACCESSIONS

A11.1. Basic Rules for Date Computations:
     A11.1.1. When converting months into days and days into months, consider each month as
     30 days.
     A11.1.2. When subtracting inclusive dates, add 1 day to the remainder. "Inclusive dates"
     means the first and last days count for credit.
     A11.1.3. If a computed date is 30 February, record it as 1 March. If a computed service date
     is 29 February, record it as 29 February even if the year is not a leap year.
     A11.1.4. In computing service between two dates, change the ending date to 30 if it is the
     last day of the month and it is other than 30. In a leap year, change 29 February to 30
     February, but do not change 28 February. In other than a leap year, change 28 February to 30
     February. The beginning date is never changed.
     A11.1.5. When subtracting a date from a date, add 1 day back if the first and last day are
     counted. When subtracting time from a date, or adding time to a date, the computed date
     (answer) that you receive is correct without any additional adding of a day, that is, computing
     DOR, date entered DEP, etc.
Computation EXAMPLE:
 3      4     5     6     7      8     9
        A11.1.5.1. If the first date that counted was the 4th and the last date was the 8th, simple
        subtraction would show 8-4=4. But, if you count the actual days, to include the 4th and
        the 8th, you will find that this inclusive period covers 5 days. In doing the calculation 8-
        4=4, you would have to add 1 day back to the result (8-4=4+1=5).
        A11.1.5.2. If source documents show that an individual spent 3 days in the DEP and
        entered active duty on the 8th, to determine the date the individual entered the DEP,
        subtract the date entered the DEP from the date entered active duty (8-3=5). The 5th
        would be the date entered DEP (Count back 3 days but do not count the 8th, since it is the
        first day of active duty).
A11.2. Age Computations:
     A11.2.1. This example shows how to compute current age, one of the initial steps in
     determining prior service eligibility. Subtract the current or converted date from the
     prospects date of birth.
Computation EXAMPLE:
 Current Date:                                  95 04 18
 Converted Date: (see paragraph A11.2.3.)       94 16 18
 Minus Date of Birth:                           49 05 05
 Equals Current Age:                            45 11 13
  A11.2.2. The following example shows how to compute age for prior service eligibility by
  subtracting total active federal military service (TAFMS) and total satisfactory reserve
158                                                            AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009


  service from current age (age at time of enlistment). Use the bottom entry from AF Form 526
  or Statement of Service to acquire service time. These documents will reflect satisfactory
  service years. See Attachment 1 for the definition of "satisfactory service." NOTE: IRR
  nonparticipation does not count as satisfactory reserve service.
Computation EXAMPLE:
  A11.2.3. To perform subtractions, it may be necessary to convert 1 year to 12 months and 1
  month to 30 days. That is, 2 years, 13 months, and 34 days converts to 3 years, 2 months, and
  04 days.
  A11.2.4. Satisfactory reserve service only accrues in 1 year increments. Months and days do
  not count for satisfactory service.
AFRCI36-2001 1 JUNE 2009                                                                    159

       INSTRUCTIONS FOR OBTAINING PRIOR SERVICE (PS) RECORDS ON
                       RECRUITING APPLICANTS

A12.1. Medical Records located at the Veterans Administration Records Management
Center (VARMC). VARMC maintains medical records on approximately 18 million veterans.
They began receiving medical records of veterans beginning 1 May 94. Therefore, if your
applicant’s EDCSA is prior to that date, contact the appropriate Reserve Personnel Center.
A12.2. Obtaining Medical Record Documentation from AFRCRS/RSOOV. Use the
following procedure to obtain medical documents on your prior service applicants:
   A12.2.1. You must send your SF180 through the current AFRCRS approved lead
   management system to be processed. This will be the only way it will be processed.
       A12.2.1.1. The applicant’s complete name, SSN and EDCSA (date transferred to the
       IRR), or date of discharge will be on the SF180.
       A12.2.1.2. Ensure the recruiter’s name, duty location, and commercial telephone/fax
       numbers are correct on the request.
   A12.2.2. All requests will be worked the day we receive the SF180. When the applicant’s
   medical record is physically located at the VARMC, you should receive the required medical
   documents within 7 - 10 working days.
   A12.2.3. If your applicant has filed for a VA medical disability the medical record will be
   filed at a VA regional claims office nearest his/her residence. In those case RSOOV will
   request the medical documents via E-mail to the appropriate VA claims office, this may take
   up to 2 months to receive back. RSOOV will fax the medical documents upon receipt.
   A12.2.4. If an applicant has a history of medical problems, please state that on the SF180.
   RSOOV will include those documents when processing your request.
   A12.2.5. RSOOV provides an update on the process through current AFRCRS approved
   lead management system.
A12.3. The National Personnel Record Center (NPRC). NPRC maintains personnel records
on approximately 80 million discharged veterans. They are filed by service branch and arrival
date. Therefore, if your applicant was discharged from five separate branches of service, there
will be a separate record filed on each of the five floors of NPRC.
A12.4. Obtaining Records from the National Personnel Record Center (NPRC). PS

- NPRC staff retrieves SF 180 from the NPRC current AFRCRS approved lead management
system bucket



-- Ensures SF 180 is filled out completely
--- If SF 180 is not filled out completely it will be returned to the recruiter without action.
-- Checks comments to see what recruiter is requesting
--annotate specific information requested (medical documentation for knee surgery etc.)
-- If a Master Records Purge is requested, indicate the reason (i.e. Re Code waiver, medical
discharge, general discharge, reconstruct service history, etc.)
NOTE: Specify all required records on your first SF 180 request. Once RSOOV has pulled an
individual record and extracted requested documents, the record goes back into the system to be
re- shelved. The re-shelving process can take up to 6 weeks: during this time the record will not
available to checkout until re-shelving is complete.
- First: NPRC staff checks eMilRecs (allows us to pull records for any branch of service if NPRC
has the record)
- Second: NPRC staff will check iPERMS to search for Army records only
- After each record search the NPRC staff will annotate the current AFRCRS approved lead
management system to update the status; "Requested personnel record from NPRC" or if no records found NPRC
staff will annotate the current AFRCRS approved lead management system with POC
information for applicable branch for recruiters to obtain personnel records)

                   FINANCIAL HARDSHIP SEPARATION CHECKLIST

A16.1. Financial Hardships of Member. Ultimately, the decision to approve or disapprove an
application for financial hardship separation is a subjective one. However, to the extent possible,
objective considerations should be used as an aid in the decision process. In this manner, each
application may be more fairly evaluated in the interest of the applicant and the Air Force
Reserve. The following checklist has been developed as an aid in preparing and evaluating
applications based on a claim of financial hardship. Not all items will be applicable in every
case. Likewise, there will be instances when information, although applicable and important, is
not provided.
A16.2. Income/Expense Statement. Prepare an income/expense statement in a format such as
the following:

             COMPLAINTS/CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRIES PROCEDURES

A18.1. AFRCRS/CC will ensure every individual alleging occurrence of alleged recruiting
improprieties is fully investigated to determine the validity of the allegations. Depending on the
severity of a substantiated allegation, training or disciplinary action may be necessary, i.e.
additional training (annotated on an AF 623), Letter of Counseling, Letter of Admonishment,
Letter of Reprimand, etc. AFI 36-2907 Unfavorable Information File (UIF) Program will be the
official guidance when disciplinary action is required. Ultimately, the Air Force Reserve
Recruiting Service Inspector General will be informed of ALL allegations. Based on this
information, the following procedures will be adhered to when situations arise.
A18.2. Squadron Commanders, First Sergeants and/or Flight Chiefs will:
   A18.2.1. Ensure compliance of this instruction by all recruiting personnel.
   A18.2.2. Serve as OPR for all inquiries and/or complaints within their Squadron (NAF/SQ
   level) or Flight Office (Flight Chiefs/local level).
   A18.2.3. Notification using their Chain of Command. Flight Chiefs will notify Squadron,
   Squadrons will notify AFRCRS/RSIG via phone or email when an allegation has been
   acknowledged.
   A18.2.4. If necessary the recruiter will be read their rights. This can be found on AF Form
   1168- "Statement of Suspect/Witness/Complainant." NOTE: This must be done anytime the
   individual’s statement could incriminate them in anyway and is used for their protection. The
   First Sergeant must be notified
   A18.2.5. Gather necessary information during investigation or inquiry (facts, data,
   documentation) from constituent/applicant and AFR recruiter or personnel involved, if
   applicable.
   A18.2.6. Compose an informative summary/report of allegations and revelations, to include
   whether a CDI (Commander Directed Investigation) or any other additional action is
   required.
   A18.2.7. Forward final report to the appropriate chain of command to include any
   documentation obtained during the inquiry investigation. Regardless of whether inquiry was
   initiated at the local or Squadron level, a copy of all final reports must be forwarded to
