This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 63-1/20-1, Acquisition and
Sustainment Life Cycle Management, AFPD 10-6, Capabilities-Based Planning and
Requirements Development, Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 5000.01, The Defense
Acquisition System, DOD Instruction (DODI) 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition
System, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 3470.01, Rapid Validation
and Resourcing of Joint Urgent Operational Needs (JUONS) in the Year of Execution. In case of
conflict between this Instruction and DOD series documents, the DOD series documents prevail.

This Air Force Instruction (AFI) pertains to Quick Reaction Capability (QRC) designated
acquisition programs only. This Instruction must be used in conjunction with AFI 10-601,
Operational Capability Requirements Development, AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment
Life Cycle Management, and AFI 99-103, Capabilities Based Test and Evaluation.

The purpose of this AFI is to establish the Air Force QRC acquisition process. It provides an
overarching framework used to satisfy warfighters’ urgent and compelling requirements, as
documented in an Urgent Operational Need (UON), Joint UON (JUON), or Chief of Staff of the
Air Force (AF/CC) direction. The Instruction provides the warfighter with a means of obtaining
a limited number of needed systems/capabilities in a combat theater during an ongoing conflict
or crisis to address a critical capability gap/shortfall that could result in loss of life and/or prevent
critical near-term mission accomplishment.

To ensure standardization, any organization supplementing this Instruction must send the
implementing publication to SAF/AQX for review and coordination before publishing. Refer
recommended changes and questions about this publication to SAF/AQXA using the AF Form
847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field through

This publication applies to all military and civilian AF personnel including major commands
(MAJCOM), direct reporting units (DRU) and field operating agencies (FOA); other individuals
or organizations as required by binding agreement or obligation with the Department of the Air
Force (DAF). This publication applies to Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard (ANG).
For nuclear systems or related components ensure the appropriate nuclear policy and guidance
are applied. Nuclear components governed by joint Department of Defense-Department of
Energy agreements are not covered by this Instruction. Due to their unique nature requiring
additional security measures, Special Access Programs shall follow guidance regarding
reporting, coordination, and use of specified tools, systems, and databases only to the extent
practicable and as coordinated with the Directorate of Special Programs (SAF/AQL) and
approved by the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This revision summarizes and updates procedures, timelines, roles, and responsibilities
associated with a QRC program. It replaces the Rapid Reaction Process with the QRC process,
to better align with how the AF responds to urgent needs. It codifies the urgent need lead
command as the single point of contact for the Air Force warfighter. It establishes a
standardized cross-functional process for responding to warfighters’ urgent needs identified
during conflict or crisis situations that are life-threatening or impede a near-term critical mission.
It fully incorporates JUONs and top-down AF/CC direction into the QRC process. It establishes
a Capability Transition Review (CTR) to formalize a follow-on strategy for QRC-fielded
solutions.

                                            Chapter 1

                            RESPONDING TO URGENT NEEDS

1.1. Responding to Urgent Needs. This chapter summarizes the Quick Reaction Capability
(QRC) acquisition process. QRC programs leverage DODI 5000.02 procedures and authorities
to speed up the fielding of systems and capabilities to satisfy near-term urgent warfighting needs.
QRC programs accomplish this through the use of cross-functional teams, tightly scoped
requirements, higher risk thresholds, concurrent activities, delegated authorities, and a
standardized process. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) shall convene a QRC
Materiel Development Decision (QRC-MDD) within 30 calendar days of urgent need
validation. The QRC process shall not exceed 180 calendar days to initial fielding (as reflected
in Figure 1.1), unless endorsed and approved in accordance with this Instruction. In addition,
QRC programs shall participate in a Capability Transition Review (CTR) to formally decide the
long-term disposition of fielded solutions. The CTR shall occur not later than 180 calendar days
following initial fielding.

Figure 1.1. QRC Timeline.




1.2. QRC Process Triggers. Urgent need validation initiates the QRC process, signified by
one of three triggers: Urgent Operational Need (UON), Joint UON (JUON), or AF/CC
direction. Upon validation, the lead command shall upload the urgent need and related
validation documentation to the Information & Resource Support System (IRSS) and (in
coordination with AF/A5RP, SAF/AQXA, and the implementing command) convene a cross-
functional QRC Integrated Product Team (QRC-IPT). The QRC-IPT acquisition and subject
matter experts develop and execute a course of action (COA) in response to a specific validated
urgent need. If Special Access information in involved, the lead command shall coordinate with
SAF/AQLX in lieu of SAF/AQXA and will not use IRSS. See AFI 10-601, Attachment 3, for
guidance regarding lead command designation.
   1.2.1. Trigger #1 – UON. A Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) submits a UON
   to the lead command, and the lead command validates the need in accordance with AFI 10-
   601, Attachment 3.
 6                                                               AFI63-114 4 JANUARY 2011


     1.2.2. Trigger #2 – JUON. In accordance with CJCSI 3470.01, a Unified Combatant
     Commander (UCC) submits a JUON to the Joint Staff. The Joint Staff validates the JUON
     and forwards to the Joint Rapid Acquisition Cell (JRAC) for coordination of a Defense-wide
     solution.
        1.2.2.1. Based on the potential solution and capability type, the JRAC will assign a Lead
        Service to fulfill the JUON. SAF/AQX is the principal AF member of the JRAC and will
        receive and process AF-assigned JUONs. Per AFI 10-601, JUONs will be processed in
        the same manner as UONs.
        1.2.2.2. JUON solutions will be fielded in accordance with JRAC guidance. The AF will
        leverage the JRAC members to coordinate fielding of capabilities, obtain special waiver
        authorities, and identify possible funding sources.
     1.2.3. Trigger #3 – AF/CC direction. AF/CC provides top-down direction to rapidly fulfill a
     validated urgent operational need. The lead command shall upload the documented AF/CC
     direction to the Information and Resource Support System (IRSS) and notify AF/A5RP,
     SAF/AQXA, and the implementing command (AFMC/A5C or AFSPC/A5X) for action.
     Lead commands will notify SAF/AQLX in lieu of SAF/AQXA for efforts involving Special
     Access Programs and will not use IRSS.
1.3. MDA Assignment. Upon receipt of a validated urgent need and unless otherwise directed,
the Capability Directorate (CD) identifies the relevant Program Executive Officer (PEO) or
Designated Acquisition Official (DAO) as the MDA for all potential Acquisition Category
(ACAT) II and III QRC programs. MDA for potential ACAT I QRC programs will be assigned
in accordance with DODI 5000.02. For highly sensitive or potential Special Access Programs,
the Service Acquisition Executive (SAE) designates the relevant PEO or DAO.
1.4. Designation as a QRC Program. QRC programs take priority for expedited reviews and
approvals not normally afforded to normal acquisition programs. QRC programs will not
normally meet Milestone decision reviews due to their short timeframes. QRC programs
provide limited materiel solutions for urgent warfighting needs and will be resourced as
high AF priorities. The delegations and priorities described in this AFI shall only be used for
QRC-designated acquisition programs. QRC designation expires upon issuance of a Capability
Transition Memorandum (CTM), or as otherwise directed by the MDA. QRC status shall not
extend beyond operational fielding of the validated urgent requirement. QRC programs shall
meet at least one of the following criteria.
     1.4.1. MDA designation: Within 30 days of UON validation, a QRC-MDD review is held, at
     which time the MDA designates an urgent need for QRC acquisition and approves a course
     of action (COA). No more than 180 calendar days shall elapse from validation of the urgent
     need to initial fielding, unless an alternate timeline has been endorsed in accordance with
     para 3.2.3.2 of this Instruction and approved by the MDA.
     1.4.2. AF/CC or JRAC direction: The AF/CC provides written top-down direction to resolve
     an urgent need or the AF accepts Lead Service responsibility for a JUON. The MDA
     designates the urgent need for QRC acquisition and approves a COA. In this case, and at the
     direction of AF/CC or JRAC, the time to initial fielding may exceed 180 calendar days from
     urgent need validation.
AFI63-114 4 JANUARY 2011                                                                    7


1.5. Headquarters Air Force (HAF) Involvement. Depending on the nature of the need, early
involvement by the Secretariat (SAF/) and Air Staff (AF/) offices will likely include SAF/AQX,
SAF/AQ Capability Directorates (CD), SAF/FMBL and SAF/FML, SAF/LL, AF/A3/5,
SAF/CIO A6, AF/TEP, and the Air Force Safety Center (AFSC/SEA). Other staff offices will be
involved as needed to support the rapid acquisition. Early QRC-IPT involvement is essential to
execute preliminary New Start activities (if required), identify and address problems early,
allocate resources, and resolve issues. SAF/AQXA maintains a collaborative web space to
provide specific points of contact and templates to aid stakeholders and expedite the process:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/qrc on the Unclassified but Sensitive Internet Protocol Router
Network and http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/sites/qrc on the Secret Internet Protocol Router
Network (SIPRNET). The SIPRNET web space hosts a wiki page for QRC-IPTs to customize,
collaborate, and share information in a secure teaming environment.
   1.5.1. HAF support activities include, but are not limited to: identifying funding sources;
   identifying and assisting with mitigation for any provision of law, policy, directive, or
   regulation that would unnecessarily impede the rapid acquisition and deployment of the
   needed equipment or modification; and supporting any documentation such as New Start
   requests.

           shall be technologically mature and able to be manufactured within the required
           timeframe. See the DOD Technology Readiness Assessment Deskbook and DOD
           Manufacturing Readiness Level Deskbook for further guidance.
           3.2.2.3. The preferred COA shall address all DOTMLPF elements.

       3.2.2.4. The preferred COA produces a testable and supportable capability.
       3.2.2.5. Critical resources shall be identified to support execution of the COA.
       3.2.2.6. Interim Contract Support (ICS) should be considered in the COA to ensure
       program stability and allow for future Business Case Analysis decisions regarding the
       long-term sustainment approach (e.g., Contractor Logistics Support, Contract
       Sustainment Support, organic sustainment, etc.)
   3.2.3. COA Refinement.
       3.2.3.1. During COA development, the lead command, warfighting command, and PM
       shall consult to determine what minimum level of capability will be militarily useful.
       The lead command shall coordinate any changes to the urgent need with the PM and
       MDA, and document in IRSS. The lead command and the MDA will coordinate
       regarding the acceptable level of technical and operational risk.
       3.2.3.2. If the QRC-IPT cannot define an executable QRC COA (i.e. exceeds 180
       calendar days from urgent need validation to initial fielding), the lead command shall
       perform one or more of the following actions. See Table 3.1.
           3.2.3.2.1. Engage with the warfighting command to refine/reduce the scope of the
           urgent need; or
           3.2.3.2.2. For potential ACAT III QRC programs, gain implementing command
           endorsement. The commander shall provide the endorsement, delegable to the vice
           commander (not to be further delegated); or
           3.2.3.2.3. For potential ACAT I/II and/or JUON-based QRC programs, gain top-
           down endorsement (AF/CC, AF/CV, or JRAC) and implementing command
           coordination; or
           3.2.3.2.4. Address the need through the normal capability based planning process and
           update the urgent need in IRSS.

3.3. QRC Materiel Development Decision (QRC-MDD). With AF/A5R assistance, the lead
command selects a preferred COA and develops an initial fielding strategy. The PM provides
the acquisition/fielding strategy to the MDA for review. At the QRC-MDD, the MDA assesses
whether the team understands the requirements, the capability qualifies for QRC designation, and
the team has accomplished sufficient planning to field a capability. The strategy should focus on
speed and concurrency, while considering possible long-term implications. A QRC-MDD is
AFI63-114 4 JANUARY 2011                                                                        17


highly streamlined, tailored version of an MDD as defined in AFI 63-101. The MDA shall
determine the specific information requirements and procedures for the QRC-MDD. The MDA
shall accomplish the QRC-MDD not later than 30 calendar days following validation of the
urgent need. See Figure 3.3.

                                                                joint ADM




    3.3.1. At the QRC-MDD, the lead command representative shall present the urgent need and
    the preferred COA (with endorsement if applicable). The PM shall present the QRC
    acquisition/fielding strategy, to include known technical and operational risks, and will
    typically address those topics provided in the template found on the SAF/AQXA-maintained
    NIPRNET QRC collaborative web space (subject to the MDA’s guidance). It is expected
    that some areas will be incomplete, due to the expedited nature of QRC acquisition. The
    QRC-MDD briefing reflects the current planning status and provides an executable strategy
    to meet the warfighter’s critical needs. The PM also presents approved, requested, or
    planned statutory waivers/deviations.
    3.3.2. Based on the scope and complexity of the preferred COA and at the discretion of the
    MDA, the QRC-MDD may be conducted in a virtual environment.
    3.3.3. Following the QRC-MDD, the MDA issues an ADM (endorsed by the lead command
    representative) with the QRC-MDD COA attached. The ADM captures decisions regarding
    QRC designation, funding, development, test, fielding, authorities, roles and responsibilities,
    and waivers.
         3.3.3.1. The ADM shall direct execution of the QRC strategy (including appropriate test
         and evaluation) and include entrance criteria for the CTR, which occurs during QRC
         Transition. These criteria shall include C&L testing prior to initial fielding, direction
         regarding any further capability assessments in-theater and prior to the CTR, and other
         necessary analysis to support the CTR. See paragraph 3.5 for a CTR description and
         reference Attachment 2 for a QRC-MDD ADM sample template.
         3.3.3.2. Within the ADM, the MDA shall identify the applicable Responsible Test
         Organization (RTO) and Operational Test Organization (OTO). Per AFI 99-103, a
         separate RTO may not be appropriate for certain programs and situations. Based on the
         QRC scope and complexity, the MDA may also direct the formation of an Integrated Test
         Team (ITT), co-chaired by the OTO and PM.
3.4. Execution. During execution, the focus shifts from COA development to COA execution.
Therefore, the leadership of the QRC-IPT transfers to the PM. To the greatest extent possible,
activities will be accomplished concurrently. All supporting organizations will expedite
 18                                                                   AFI63-114 4 JANUARY 2011

   3.4.1. The PM leads QRC acquisition execution. Execution includes development, testing,
   certification and accreditation, as well as shipping, receiving, and training.
   3.4.2. The PM shall field QRC solutions which are operationally safe, suitable, and effective,
   to the levels agreed by the lead command and MDA. Note: A QRC program may not bypass
   the requirement for certification for operational use of new or modified munitions and related
   equipment in accordance with AFI 91-205, Non-Nuclear Munitions Safety Board. The lead
   command shall determine whether the solution is ready for initial fielding.
   3.4.3. The lead command and PM shall identify ESOH hazards, evaluate risk, and ensure
   appropriate level of risk acceptance. For ACAT II and III QRC programs, the MDA shall
   consult with the lead command and serve as the delegated acceptance authority for high and
   serious ESOH risks. The MDA for such programs shall notify AF/SE and the SAE of any
   accepted high ESOH risk items, and document in an ADM. For all QRC programs, it is
   expected the MDA, testers, lead commands and warfighters will accept higher levels of
   operational risk to rapidly fulfill urgent requirements. Note: The PM maintains acceptance
   authority for medium and low ESOH risks.
   3.4.4. Prior to initial fielding, the PM, in coordination with the lead and warfighting
   commands, shall ensure the fielding plan delivers training to support the capability’s
   intended uses and assets ready for operational use and sustainment. Required certifications
   vary and are dependent upon the chosen materiel solution. The PM needs to accomplish the
   minimally acceptable testing, certifications, and/or waivers required to operate and sustain
   the capability in-theater.
   3.4.5. Test & Evaluation (T&E). The PM and lead command must judiciously streamline
   testing in order to rapidly field assets. To that end, the PM and lead command shall ensure
   T&E representation on the QRC-IPT as soon as possible to identify, coordinate, and secure
   T&E resources. The PM and lead command will use T&E as an assessment tool to gauge
   whether the performance risk is acceptable and assess the solution’s C&L.
       3.4.5.1. The OTO shall coordinate with the PM to design and execute a test plan that
       provides acceptable evidence of QRC suitability and effectiveness.
AFI63-114 4 JANUARY 2011                                                                      19


       3.4.5.2. The OTO shall provide regular interim feedback to the PM during C&L testing.
       The OTO shall immediately inform the PM and lead command of any evaluated
       QRC characteristics that may prevent fielding. Unless so notified, the lead
       command may field QRC assests prior to release of the final test report.
       3.4.5.3. Within 10 calendar days of the last assessment event and prior to initially
       fielding the QRC, the OTO shall provide preliminary C&L results to the PM and lead
       command. The lead command shall provide the preliminary results to the warfighting
       command.
       3.4.5.4. Within 20 calendar days of the last assessment event, the OTO shall provide to
       the PM and lead command a final C&L report in accordance with AFI 99-103. The lead
       command shall provide the report to the warfighting command.
       3.4.5.5. Test center commanders shall afford QRC programs high priority by making
       T&E resources (e.g., equipment, personnel, and ranges) readily available for program
       use.
       3.4.5.6. If test-related modifications to host platforms are required, an AF Form 1067 is
       required for documentation, but does not have to be completed prior to executing the
       modification. A QRC ADM fulfills AF Form 1067 parts I, II, III and V. Part IV shall be
       documented by the PM.
       3.4.5.7. As soon as possible, the PM shall coordinate with the Office of the Secretary of
       Defense Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) if statutory T&E
       requirements apply to the preferred COA (e.g., Live Fire Test and Evaluation).
       3.4.5.8. Following initial fielding and prior to the CTR, the OTO shall provide an
       assessment to the PM regarding the fielded capability’s suitability and effectiveness. The
       PM will adjust and re-evaluate the QRC solution as necessary.
   3.4.6. During execution, the PM shall immediately notify the MDA upon determination the
   QRC program will be delayed beyond the MDA-directed schedule or will not meet
   performance/cost expectations. The MDA may determine any relevant thresholds to trigger
   this notification. The notification does not stop work on the QRC program unless the
   MDA so directs. Upon notification, the MDA will consult with the lead and warfighting
   commands to determine whether to continue, modify, or terminate the program.
3.5. Transition. For QRC programs, the MDA shall convene a CTR no later than 180 calendar
days following initial fielding. At the CTR, the MDA and lead command review the fielded
capability’s assessed suitability and effectiveness and formally document decisions regarding
further development or disposition of the capability. See Figure 3.5.

   3.5.1. Based on consultation with the warfighter, the MDA and lead command shall direct an
   appropriate combination of the following outcomes, documented in a CTM with a capability
   transition strategy and ADM attached as appropriate.
       3.5.1.1. Outcome #1 – Enduring Program. The results of the CTR establish the need to
       maintain the capability under an enduring program in accordance with applicable statutes,
       regulation, and policy. The lead command shall consult with AF/A5R and develop all
       appropriate operational requirements documentation for Air Force Requirements
       Oversight Council (AFROC)/Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validation.
       The PM shall make recommendations regarding completion of previously deferred
       documentation and certification requirements. The MDA and lead command shall
       document the bridge strategy from the QRC solution to the enduring program, and at
       minimum address sustainment, documentation, and funding. If the MDA approves the
       enduring capability for further development and entry into the acquisition framework, a
       signed ADM will be attached to the CTM.
       3.5.1.2. Outcome #2 – In-Theater Sustainment. The results of the CTR determine the
       QRC assets will be sustained in-theater until no longer needed by the warfighter. The
       lead and implementing commands shall sustain the QRC assets in accordance with
       applicable statute, regulation, and policy. The lead command shall consult with AF/A5R
       and determine whether additional requirements documentation is required. The PM shall
       make recommendations regarding completion of all previously deferred documentation
       and certification requirements. The MDA and lead command shall document the funding
       strategy to sustain the QRC solution. When the capability is no longer needed, the lead
       and implementing commands shall demilitarize and dispose of the assets in accordance
       with applicable statute, regulation, and policy.
AFI63-114 4 JANUARY 2011                                                                     21


      3.5.1.3. Outcome #3 – Demilitarization and Disposal. The results of the CTR determine
      the capability is no longer required. The lead and implementing commands shall
      demilitarize and dispose of the assets in accordance with applicable statute, regulation,
      and policy. The MDA and lead command shall document the funding strategy.
   3.5.2. The MDA shall issue a CTM (endorsed by the lead command’s representative)
   documenting all decisions and requirements for further capability documentation,
   development, sustainment, demilitarization and disposal, and schedule to complete activities.
   QRC designation shall expire upon issuance of the CTM, unless justification for extension is
   provided by the MDA in the CTM. QRC designation shall not extend beyond operational
   fielding of the validated urgent requirement. See Attachment 3 for a sample template.
   3.5.3. Once all required QRC assets have been fielded and the CTR has been accomplished,
   the lead command shall update the IRSS status of the urgent need to ―Closed.‖
3.6. Contracting Considerations.
   3.6.1. QRC programs are authorized to rapidly contract for urgent solutions.
   3.6.2. Systems Requirements Documents supporting QRC programs do not require the same
   formal coordination with the lead command, as is required in AFI 63-101 of non-QRC
   programs. The lead command representative on the QRC-IPT may fulfill the requirement.
   3.6.3. Competition in Contracting Act (CICA). The CICA includes several exceptions to the
   requirements for full and open competition that provide flexibility. "Unusual and compelling
   urgency" is the exception most applicable to a QRC solution. This exception allows
   contracts to be awarded prior to completing the justification and approval (J&A)
   documentation. The CICA does not provide an exemption from small business set-aside
   rules, but the PM’s market research should carefully consider both schedule and performance
   risk when identifying a suitable source to satisfy a QRC requirement. The contracting officer
   shall obtain a legal opinion before moving forward under any CICA exception. (Ref: U.S.C.
   2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-2, and DFARS 206.302.2)
   3.6.4. Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) Rapid Acquisition Authority (RAA). The JRAC is
   responsible for receiving and reviewing cases requiring the use of the RAA. The RAA
   provides the SECDEF authority to waive laws and regulations dealing with testing and
   procurement to acquire critically required equipment and eliminate a combat capability
   deficiency that has resulted in combat fatalities. This authority is limited to an aggregated
   amount stipulated in statute (currently not more than $100 million during any fiscal year).
   For acquisitions of equipment during the fiscal year in which the Secretary executes this
   authority, the Secretary may use any funds available to the DOD for that fiscal year. (Ref:
   FY05 NDAA, Sec. 811)
3.7. New Start Parallel Process. The CD, in conjunction with SAF/AQXR, SAF/FM,
SAF/GC, and SAF/LL will make a decision on Congressional notification of a New Start.
   3.7.1. When appropriate, in order to accelerate the New Start process, the responsible CD
   shall begin creating a New Start package following initial notification of a validated urgent
   need. As the required information becomes available from the QRC-IPT, the package will
   enter New Start coordination to ensure timely delivery to Congress.
 22                                                            AFI63-114 4 JANUARY 2011


   3.7.2. For additional information on New Start determination and guidance, see AFI  65-
   601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, AFI 63-101, Acquisition and Sustainment Life
   Cycle Management, and DOD 7000.14R, Department of Defense Financial Management
   Regulation (FMRS) Vol. 3, Chapter 6, paragraphs 060401 E, 060403, and 060404.
3.8. Tracking Urgent Needs.
   3.8.1. Per AFI 10-601, the lead command shall maintain status in IRSS for validated urgent
   needs. The lead command shall enter all newly validated urgent needs into IRSS and mark
   as ―Validated.‖ Following initial fielding, the lead command shall update the status to
   ―Fielded.‖ Once all QRC assets have been fielded and the CTR has been accomplished, the
   lead command shall update the status to ―Closed.‖
   3.8.2. To track QRC acquisition execution, PMs shall maintain status in the SMART and
   ensure the ―QRC‖ data field is checked. The QRC annotation ensures the program can be
   easily queried by the SMART search mechanism. The PM shall ensure program
   documentation, including any ADMs, is included in the SMART record. In addition, PMs
   shall provide regular status as requested by the SAE (per the instructions and format posted
   to the NIPRNET QRC collaborative web space).
   3.8.3. Highly sensitive or Special Access Programs shall use other tracking mechanisms as
   appropriate.
AFI63-114 4 JANUARY 2011                                                                      23


                                          Chapter 4

                                 TAILORING GUIDANCE

4.1. Streamlined Documentation and Certifications. DODD 5000.01 and DODI 5000.02
authorize MDAs to tailor the regulatory information requirements and acquisition process
procedures in the Instruction to achieve cost, schedule, and performance goals. In addition, the
MDA may tailor all guidance in AFI 63-101 or AFI 63-131, Modification Program
Management, consistent with statutory requirements. The MDA must streamline the
acquisition program to the maximum extent possible and accept appropriate risk to
provide rapid capability to warfighting commanders. This explicit MDA authority and
responsibility is central to QRC acquisition. The MDA, testers, lead command, and
warfighters shall accept a level of risk higher than normal to satisfy urgent needs.
   4.1.1. Regulatory requirements have the ability to be tailored, whereas statutory
   requirements may not be tailored except in rare cases (e.g., SECDEF RAA). The tables in
   DODI 5000.02, Enclosure 4, differentiate between regulatory and statutory information
   requirements and must be carefully reviewed for applicability.
   4.1.2. The MDA and supporting agencies must limit documentation and certification
   requirements to the absolute minimum needed to operate and sustain the QRC in the field
   while remaining legally sufficient. Although legal sufficiency is still required, the planning
   and documentation threshold is much lower than that required of a non-QRC program.
   These requirements vary, depending upon the capability; however, the table in Attachment 6
   will serve as guidance for most QRC programs.
   4.1.3. The MDA shall defer information requirements and analyses not necessary for initial
   fielding of QRC solutions. At the CTR, the PM shall make recommendations to the MDA
   regarding completion of all previously deferred documentation and certification
   requirements.
   4.1.4. Note that based on the scope and difficulty of the preferred COA and at the discretion
   of the MDA, the QRC-MDD and other programmatic decisions may be made in a virtual
   environment. The MDA shall document virtual decisions in an ADM, endorsed by the lead
   command.
4.2. Expedited Staffing and Coordination. When reviewing QRC program documentation,
functional organizations and commands shall treat QRC programs as higher priority than non-
QRC programs. QRC programs by definition are essential to the fulfillment of an urgent need
and should receive immediate attention. Reviewing organizations shall complete QRC related
taskings within five calendar days of documentation transmittal for review. It is expected
organizations will use streamlined staffing mechanisms, including parallel and
collaborative reviews, to support the short timelines associated with QRC programs.
4.3. Solution Scope. The QRC process shall only provide or modify the minimum number of
systems needed for testing and in-theater operations.
4.4. Modifications. If the approved COA directs a modification to a system as described in AFI
63-131, these modifications shall be performed as line-replaceable ―Group B‖ modification kits
to the maximum extent possible. This allows the modification of replacement weapons systems
 24                                                            AFI63-114 4 JANUARY 2011


as they rotate in and out of the combat theater of operations. An AF Form 1067, Modification
Proposal, is required for documentation, but does not have to be completed prior to executing
the QRC modification. A QRC ADM fulfills AF Form 1067 parts I, II, III and V. Part IV shall
be documented by the PM.
4.5. Funding. No separate or special source of funding is established for urgent need
requirements. The lead command will assess potential funding solutions and balance their
impact against the criticality of the need. If reprogramming is warranted, above or below
threshold reprogramming requests shall be expedited by supporting agencies.
   4.5.1. If Operations & Maintenance (O&M) funds are required, lead commands will
   normally fund QRC sustainment, apply an Emergency and Special Program (ESP) code, and
   work with SAF/FMB to resolve funding disconnects.
   4.5.2. If Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) and/or Procurement funds are
   required, lead commands will coordinate with CDs, SAF/AQXR, SAF/FMBI, and the PM to
   reprogram funds internally or identify other potential funding sources.
   4.5.3. For C-IED initiatives seeking funding through the JIEDDO-administered Joint IED
   Defeat Fund (JIEDDF), the PM will coordinate with AF/A5R-Q and participate in JIEDDO’s
   JCAAMP.
4.6. Cyberspace Domain Considerations. QRC programs shall comply with applicable
statutes and regulations, as summarized in AFI 63-101, Section 3E. These considerations
include (but are not limited to) spectrum certification, Clinger-Cohen Act compliance,
interoperability certification, and information assurance requirements. Refer to the NIPRNET
QRC collaborative web space for further guidance.
   4.6.1. PMs will seek authority to use a Tailored Information Support Plan or leverage an
   existing Information Support Plan.
   4.6.2. The PM shall ensure cyberspace related certifications and approvals are worked in
   parallel to other program activities.
   4.6.3. The PM shall review DODI 8580.1, Information Assurance in the Defense Acquisition
   System, DODI 8510.01, Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification and
   Accreditation Process (DIACAP), and AFI 33-210, Air Force Certification and Accreditation
   Program (AFCAP) to leverage existing authorities and streamline information assurance
   approvals.
   4.6.4. SAF/CIO A6 and DAAs shall work with the QRC-IPT to ensure cyberspace related
   waivers, approvals, and confirmations are expedited in accordance with this Instruction.
   4.6.5. For QRC programs requiring spectrum certification, the PM and lead command shall
   engage the warfighting command as early as possible to ensure the QRC will be certified to
   operate in-theater. Warfighting commands typically require at least 90 days lead time for
   frequency actions. The required lead time will vary based on host nation agreements. See
   AFI 33-118, Electromagnetic Spectrum Management for further guidance.
4.7. Technology and Program Protection Considerations. In accordance with DoDI 5200.39
and DoD 5000.2, the PM shall identify critical program information. If present, implement
countermeasures appropriate for the program (e.g. anti-tamper, information assurance, security,
and Science and Technical Information controls). The PM shall address program protection in
AFI63-114 4 JANUARY 2011                                                                     25


the COA. Following initial fielding and based on the CTR decision, the MDA shall ensure
compliance with applicable DOD and AF policies.
4.8. Fielding Considerations.
   4.8.1. The lead command shall develop the initial fielding strategy for presentation at the
   QRC-MDD.
   4.8.2. Following the QRC-MDD, the lead command and PM shall develop a QRC fielding
   plan for approval by the warfighting command prior to initial fielding. The plan shall
   consider contractor support; technical data; spectrum allocation; certifications; Reception,
   Staging, Onward Movement, and Integration (RSOI); training; sustainment; support
   equipment; spares; and theater and country clearances for personnel. Warfighting commands
   typically require fielding plans 90 calendar days prior to initial fielding. Specific command
   requirements will vary.
   4.8.3. ICS is usually preferred to initially support QRC programs, with more robust support
   to follow. If the QRC will be sustained and/or further developed as an enduring program,
   Business Case Analyses may be conducted to determine the long-term mix of contractor and
   organic support.
   4.8.4. Refer to AFPAM 63-128 for further guidance.
4.9. Configuration and Data Management Considerations. In accordance with MIL-HDBK-
61A, the PM shall ensure the technical baseline is under configuration management before the
QRC is initially fielded. The lead command shall participate in the QRC Capability
Configuration Control Boards, as necessary. The PM will ensure QRC contracts do not limit the
government's ability to assert data rights to further develop and/or sustain the capability.
