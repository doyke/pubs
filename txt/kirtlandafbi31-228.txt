This instruction implements AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, AFMC Supple-
ment, and is designed to assist traffic wardens in accomplishing their duties in a professional and correct
manner. Failure to follow established procedures outlined in this instruction may lead to removal from the
program.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
Corrected administrative errors. Converted the instruction from a Security Forces Instruction to a KAFBI
and updated OPR and Certifier information.


1. Responsibilities. Provide enforcement of reserved parking in their areas of responsibility by citing
offenders. Traffic wardens may cite vehicles that are illegally parked or abandoned in their areas of
responsibility. They may not cite personnel for moving violations or expired vehicle registration. Traffic
wardens are responsible for keeping a running log of all citations issued and must be familiar with AFI
31-204, KAFB Supplement to AFI 31-204, and this instruction.

2. General. The commander of each unit will assign in writing who will perform traffic warden duties
for the enforcement of unit-owned parking areas. The traffic warden position is valid for a period of 1 year
from the date of the letter. This person must be an E-4 or above, competent, honest, and knowledgeable of
the task to be performed. Appoint only one primary and one alternate traffic warden per building. Submit
requests to 377 SFS/SFOL. All designated Traffic Warden personnel are authorized to issue the DD Form
1408, Armed Forces Traffic Ticket and DD Form 2504, Abandoned Vehicle Notice. Personnel will be
trained an issued by 377 SFS/SFOL located in building 20220, second floor.

3. Selective Enforcement Policy.

    3.1. Traffic wardens will practice selective enforcement. They will avoid any appearance of special
    enforcement campaigns, ticket quotas, or any other "hard nose" approach. Citations issued by traffic
    wardens are accountable items. As a rule, if there is any doubt whether a citation should be issued, it
    will not be issued. Return any citation that is requested to be voided due to an administrative error to
    377 SFS/SFOL with a concise typed letter annotating why the citation is to be voided. DO NOT
    throw citations away! Some reasons to void a citation are:
       3.1.1. Warden entered incorrect information.
       3.1.2. Violation occurred outside of legal jurisdiction.
       3.1.3. Citation was not properly completed. 3.1.4. Reviewing authority determined the citation
       was not valid for legal or other unforeseen reasons.
    3.2. Traffic wardens will only issue parking citations in the parking lot for which they are authorized.
    They will not issue citations in parking lots where they have no jurisdiction or authority.
    3.3. If a citation is to be issued for being parked overtime or abandoned, the vehicle must first be
    chalked, i.e., a line drawn from the lower half of the front drivers side tire, down onto the pavement,
    and annotated with the time and date chalked. The time and date chalked will be annotated in the
    remarks section of the citation.
    3.4. All parking citations and abandoned vehicle notices issued will be delivered to the Law Enforce-
    ment Desk or 377 SFS/SFOL within 24 hours of the date and time issued or they will be voided.

4. Abandoned Vehicle Notices. Traffic wardens may issue DD Forms 2504 as well as citations. Stan-
dards for impoundment may be found in AFI 31-204, Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision, Sec-
tion 6.2.
    4.1. If an Abandoned Vehicle Notice is issued, a citation will also be issued titled “Abandoned Vehi-
    cle/Overtime Parking.”

    Notice.

   describing the facts of the citation. Any offender may rebut a citation by providing, in writing, the cir-
   cumstances for the rebuttal to his/her commander or civilian equivalent director. They will in-turn
   comment and endorse the rebuttal and forward to 377 SFS/SFAA. Security forces will review the
   action and forward to 377 SFS/CC for resolution. 377 MSG/CC is the final appeal authority to the
   rebuttal.
   6.2. If contact is made with an offender, the traffic warden should not argue with the offender, rather
   the traffic warden should inform the offender of the rebuttal procedures.
