                                                Chapter 1

                                GENERAL INFORMATION/POLICY

1.1. Promotion Program Objectives. A promotion is not a reward for past performance or years of ser-
vice. Only those officers who clearly show potential for increased responsibility should be promoted. Spe-
cific promotion program objectives are to:
    1.1.1. Promote officers through a fair and equitable selection system that will satisfy the needs of the
    ANG for a viable officer force.
    1.1.2. Provide the necessary career incentive to attract and maintain a high quality officer force.
    1.1.3. Provide reasonably stable, consistent, and visible career progression patterns for ANG officers.
    1.1.4. Maintain the proper balance between mandatory and position vacancy promotions that clearly
    identifies the position vacancy promotees as officers with potential above that of his/her peers.

1.2. Promotion Policies. This instruction is applicable to all ANG officers regardless of status (tradi-
tional, technician, military duty, and statutory tour).
    1.2.1. The promotion of officers in the ANG is a function of the State, as distinguished from Federal
    recognition of such promotions in accordance with (IAW) NGR (AF) 36-3, Federal Recognition
    Boards for Appointment or Promotions in the Air National Guard below General Officer.
    1.2.2. Federal recognition of a promotion will be at the discretion of the CNGB, acting for the Secre-
    tary of the Air Force (SAF). Federal recognition is extended upon receipt of an order announcing Fed-
    eral recognition. An officer will not wear the insignia of a higher grade prior to Federal recognition.
    1.2.3. A lieutenant colonel failing to be recommended for promotion to colonel by the ANG Colonel
    Review Board will not be recommended again for promotion to colonel against a position vacancy for
    at least nine months after the date of notification from the Director, Air National Guard (NGB/CF).
    1.2.4. An officer will be promoted as a Reserve of the Air Force effective on the date upon which Fed-
    eral recognition in the higher grade is extended.
    1.2.5. The results of a Federal Recognition Examination Board are good for only 60 days. If Federal
    recognition has not been requested by the Adjutant General within 60 days of a Federal Recognition
    Examination Board, then a new board must be convened. Nominations returned without action by
    ANG/DP for any reason (e.g., a waiver request was denied, eligibility criteria not met) cannot be
    resubmitted without a new Federal Recognition Examination Board.
    1.2.6. Posthumous Promotions. A posthumous promotion may be extended provided the member was
    on active duty or in a training status at the time of death and was either on a recommended list for
    ROPB promotion, or previously recommended for position vacancy promotion by a Federal Recogni-
    tion Examination Board.
       1.2.6.1. The immediate commander submits the request for posthumous promotion through the
       Military Personnel Flight (MPF) and State headquarters to ANG/DP. (NOTE: A posthumous pro-
       motion must be processed as soon as possible after death. Immediate telephone contact from the
       State Headquarters with ANG/DP is desirable.)
ANGI36-2504 28 JULY 2004                                                                                       5


        1.2.6.2. The request must include the date of death, the circumstances of death, and a statement
        that the commander had not initiated and did not plan to initiate a promotion propriety action
        against the officer. ANG/DP processes the promotion order.
        1.2.6.3. No financial benefits accrue as a result of a posthumous promotion.
        1.2.6.4. The effective date of promotion will be the day of death.

1.3. Promotion Recognition. Appropriate recognition of an officer upon promotion is an integral part of
military customs and traditions. It signifies leadership's faith in the officer's loyalty, integrity, and profes-
sionalism. Additionally, such recognition serves to remind the officer of increased responsibilities
required from advancement.
    1.3.1. Promotion Ceremonies. Appropriate ceremonies to publicly recognize the importance of pro-
    motions are highly encouraged. Such ceremonies will not be held prior to the effective date of promo-
    tion. EXCEPTION: Promotion pin-on ceremonies may be held on the last duty day before the
    effective date of promotion if the effective date falls on a non-duty day. The officer being recognized
    is to be advised that although the pin-on ceremony is being held early, the promotion does not affect
    the member's pay, seniority, or entitlements. Promotion propriety actions may be initiated subsequent
    to the early pin-on ceremony but before the effective date of promotion. Promotion ceremonies must
    not be held prior to Federal Recognition being extended by ANG/DP.
    1.3.2. It is recommended the following be read during the ceremony:


    “ATTENTION TO ORDERS. SPECIAL ORDER (Number of Federal Recognition Order),
    DATED (Date of Order). THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, ACTING UPON THE
    RECOMMENDATION OF THE CHIEF, NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU, AND THE
    SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE HAS PLACED SPECIAL TRUST AND CONFIDENCE
    IN THE PATRIOTISM, INTEGRITY AND ABILITIES OF (Current Grade and Name). IN
    VIEW OF THE SPECIAL QUALITIES AND HIS/HER DEMONSTRATED POTENTIAL TO
    SERVE IN THE HIGHER GRADE (Current Grade and Name) IS PROMOTED AND
    FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED IN THE PERMANENT GRADE OF (New Grade), (State) AIR
    NATIONAL GUARD, EFFECTIVE (Effective Date Specified in Federal Recognition Order).
    BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE.”

    1.3.3. Oath of Office. Although not required by law, restating the Oath of Office provides the officer
    an opportunity to express his/her commitment to professionalism and officer-ship. Each officer should
    be given the opportunity to restate the Oath of Office using NGB 337, Oaths of Office, prepared to
    reflect the new grade. NGB 337 forms executed for this reason will be filed in the Unit Personnel
    Records Group (UPRG). Individuals promoted in the ANG may take the oath before an officer of any
    component of an Armed Force of the United States (includes Reserve components), whether on active
    service or retired.

                                                 Chapter 2

                                      MANDATORY PROMOTION

2.1. Promotion to First Lieutenant. A second lieutenant must be promoted to first lieutenant on the
date when two years of promotion service is completed, or the officer must be found Not Qualified for
Promotion (NQP). NQP request must be processed IAW AFI 36-2504, Chapter 7. A finding of NQP
approved by the SAF must be accomplished prior to separation/discharge of the officer. An officer pro-
moted to first lieutenant may be extended Federal recognition without examination by a Federal Recogni-
tion Examination Board.
     2.1.1. Prior to the date on which the officer reaches two years service, the unit commander informs
     the officer of the NQP recommendation in writing and places the member on a six-month probation
     period. If the officer is found qualified for promotion during, or at the completion of the probation
     period, the officer will be promoted.
     2.1.2. At the end of the six-month probation period, the unit commander has the following options:
        2.1.2.1. Promote the officer to first lieutenant, if not promoted earlier.
        2.1.2.2. Request, through command channels, SAF approval to extend the probation period IAW
        AFI 36-2504, Chapter 7.
        2.1.2.3. Request SAF approval to separate the officer for being NQP IAW AFI 36-2504, Chapter
        7. Refer to AFI 36-3209, Separation Procedures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve
        Officers for guidance on how to separate such officers.

2.2. Promotion to Captain, Major, or Lieutenant Colonel:
     2.2.1. Each ANG first lieutenant, captain, and major, if not promoted under the provisions of position
     vacancy promotion, will be considered for promotion by a ROPB convened at Headquarters Air
     Reserve Personnel Center (HQ ARPC). If recommended by the board, the officer will be promoted as
     a Reserve of the Air Force upon completing the following years of promotion service:

3.     Lieutenant Colonel                     Seven years

     2.2.2. ROPB dates and promotion eligibility criteria are released well in advance of board convening
     dates. Approximately five months before each board, HQ ARPC should notify ANG MPFs via Pro-
     motion Recommendation and In-board Support Management (PRISM), of eligible officers to be con-
     sidered by that board as identified by information in the Military Personnel Data System (MILPDS) at
     the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC). Upon receipt of the board criteria, MPFs will:
ANGI36-2504 28 JULY 2004                                                                                7


     2.2.2.1. Request an Officer Pre-selection Brief (OPB). If not received within 90 days of the board
     convening date, the MPF will request a Records Review, Report on Individual Personnel (RIP)
     from the MILPDS. Each eligible officer must be advised that it is his/her responsibility to ensure
     the data on the OPB or RIP is correct. If an officer has been reassigned, the MPF will forward the
     OPB to the members gaining MPF.
     2.2.2.2. Conduct a record’s review with each eligible officer when possible. If a record’s review is
     not possible, forward the OPB or Record’s Review RIP to the officer and request it be reviewed,
     updated if needed, and returned to the MPF with supporting documentation (establish a suspense
     date that will permit processing of required updates). The MPF must ensure corrections are
     updated in MILPDS prior to the HQ ARPC suspense date for inclusion in the records reviewed by
     the ROPB. When this is not possible, MPFs must advise HQ ARPC, Promotion Board Secretariat
     (HQ ARPC/DPBB) by message, with copy to State Headquarters and ANG/DP, of all data updated
     after the suspense date. Emphasis must be placed on forwarding documents to HQ ARPC to per-
     mit filing in the member's selection folder prior to the ROPB convening date.
     2.2.2.3. Inform the officer that a letter may be sent to the board (see Paragraph 2.2.3.).
     2.2.2.4. Require commanders to review the eligibility list received from PRISM through State
     Headquarters and certify each officer is qualified for promotion or initiate appropriate promotion
     propriety action IAW AFI 36-2504. (NOTE: Once ANG/DP suspense date is passed, an officer
     cannot be considered for position vacancy promotion to that grade until after the ROPB results are
     published. Refer to paragraph 3.3.1.)
     2.2.2.5. Provide ANG/DP, through State Headquarters, a certified listing of eligible officers for
     each board by the suspense date established in the forwarding letter from ANG/DP. Failure to
     return the list by the suspense date established by ANG/DP constitutes an automatic certification
     of the list. ANG/DP will provide HQ ARPC, Reserve of the Air Force Selection Board Secretariat
     (HQ ARPC/DPB) a consolidated list of all ANGUS officers (captain through lieutenant colonel)
     eligible/ineligible for promotion board consideration.
  2.2.3. Officers eligible for promotion or continuation consideration may send a written communica-
  tion to the board calling attention to any matter concerning themselves that the officer considers
  important to the officer’s case. The officer must send the written communication to HQ ARPC, Pro-
  motion Eligibility Division (HQ ARPC/DPBA). Letters must have original signatures. HQ ARPC/
  DPBA will not accept FAX copies for presentation to the board.
     2.2.3.1. The officer submitting the letter must be able to support any statements made in the letter.
     The officer must sign the letter and place his/her Social Security Number (SSN) below the signa-
     ture to ensure filing the letter in the correct selection folder.
     2.2.3.2. Letters should arrive at least 30 days before the board convenes. Letters must arrive no
     later than 0800 the day the board convenes, for consideration by the board.
     2.2.3.3. HQ ARPC/DPBA destroys letters after the board adjourns. An officer who requests the
     letter be returned must provide a stamped, self-addressed envelope.
     2.2.3.4. The board will not consider letters written by others on behalf of the officer.
     2.2.3.5. Letters may not contain any attachments, criticize any officer, or reflect on the character,
     conduct, or motives of any officer. Do not attach anything that may become or is already a part of
8                                                                            ANGI36-2504 28 JULY 2004


       the officer’s record (such as any Promotion Recommendation Form (PRF), Officer Performance
       Reports (OPR), or decoration narratives).
    2.2.4. Notification Procedures:
       2.2.4.1. HQ ARPC will provide listings of officers recommended for, or failed of selection for
       promotion to each MPF via PRISM, which will in-turn furnish unit commanders with the names
       of officers selected and/or not selected for promotion on the public release date established by HQ
       ARPC. Officers must not be informed of their status (selection/non-selection) until the public
       release date. On that day, the immediate commander or their designee will personally notify offic-
       ers of the board results. MPFs will ensure commanders are aware that they may delay a promotion
       or remove an individual from a recommended list IAW AFI 36-2504, Chapter 7.
       2.2.4.2. Written notification will be provided to officers failed of selection for promotion. Attach-
       ment 2 is a letter format for notifying officers who have failed of selection for promotion for the
       first time. Attachment 3 is a letter format for notifying twice failed promotion selection officers.
       These letters will be prepared by the servicing MPF. The following procedures apply:
           2.2.4.2.1. The information contained in the HQ ARPC listing referenced in paragraph 2.2.4.2.,
           is “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” and may be seen only by individuals responsible for admin-
           istrative processing actions. The information will not be released until the public release dates
           provided by PRISM.
           2.2.4.2.2. MPFs will review PRISM to determine if any officers assigned to their organization
           were failed of selection for promotion. They will prepare the appropriate letter (Attachment
           2. or Attachment 3) for each identified officer IAW the following:
               2.2.4.2.2.1. The letter will be typed on wing/wing equivalent organizational letterhead.
               2.2.4.2.2.2. The wing/wing equivalent commander will sign the letter.
           2.2.4.2.3. Officers having failed selection for promotion will acknowledge receipt of the noti-
           fication letter in writing. This acknowledgment will be filed in the officer's Unit Personnel
           Records Group at the MPF.
       2.2.4.3. As soon as practical after the public release date of the list, the letter will be sent or pro-
       vided to the officer failed of selection for promotion by his/her immediate commander or desig-
       nee.
    2.2.5. The sample letters in Attachment 4 and Attachment 5, may be used at the Adjutant General's
    option to recognize a promoted member and his/her employer. Each letter should be tailored to sup-
    port recognition of the achievement and appreciation for the employer’s support. Letters to employers
    should be forwarded only with the concurrence of the promoted officer. The Adjutant General or his
    designated representative must sign the letter. This authority cannot be delegated below the Wing or
    Group Commander. With some modification, similar letters may be used for position vacancy promo-
    tion recognition.

2.3. Actions Upon Selection for Promotion.
    2.3.1. Request Federal recognition IAW Chapter 4 of this instruction.
ANGI36-2504 28 JULY 2004                                                                                  9


   2.3.2. To be eligible for continued Federal recognition as a member of the ANG, an officer placed on
   a recommended list by the ROPB must be promoted in the ANG of his/her state to the higher grade for
   which recommended effective no later than the date established on the recommended list.
   2.3.3. Technician officers, who are selected for a mandatory promotion to a grade that exceeds their
   UMDG authorized grade may be retained IAW ANGI 36-2101, Assignments within the Air National
   Guard, Table 4.2.
   2.3.4. An officer selected for a Reserve of the Air Force promotion is considered to have accepted it
   on the effective date unless he/she expressly declines or is granted a voluntary delay of promotion
   IAW AFI 36-2504, Chapter 8, or is involuntarily delayed under provisions of paragraph 2.7., of this
   instruction.
   2.3.5. Promotion Effective Dates for mandatory promotions will consummate on the anniversary of
   the date of rank (DOR) in the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the board was conducted,
   provided the state complies with instructions provided in Chapter 4 of this instruction. Exceptions:
   States may process position vacancy promotions prior to the projected effective date; or, granted vol-
   untary promotion delay; or, individual is subjected to involuntary promotion delay.

2.4. Promotion Dates. Statutory Tour Officers and Military Duty Personnel who are promoted subse-
quent to periods of involuntary delay will be granted a retroactive DOR to the original projected promo-
tion effective date, but will not be entitled to retroactive pay IAW AFI 36-2504, Officer Promotion,
Continuation and Selective Early Removal in the Reserve of the Air Force.

2.5. Failure of Selection for Promotion.
   2.5.1. Once Failed. An officer on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL), in a grade below lieutenant
   colonel, in or above the promotion zone established for that officer’s grade and competitive category,
   is considered once failed of selection for promotion if this is the first mandatory consideration and the
   officer:
       2.5.1.1. Is not recommended for promotion by the ROPB
       2.5.1.2. Declines a promotion for which selected
   2.5.2. Twice Failed. An officer on the RASL, in a grade below lieutenant colonel, in or above the pro-
   motion zone established for that officer’s grade and competitive category, is considered twice failed of
   selection for promotion if any of the following applies:
       2.5.2.1. The officer is considered but not recommended for promotion a second time by a manda-
       tory promotion board or a Special Selection Board (SSB) in place of a second mandatory board.
       2.5.2.2. The officer declines a promotion when recommended by a mandatory promotion board or
       SSB, after previously failing selection or previously declining a promotion.
       2.5.2.3. The President removed the officer’s name from the report, or the Secretary of Defense
       removed the name from a promotion list after recommendation by a mandatory promotion board
       or by a SSB and:
           2.5.2.3.1. The officer is not recommended for promotion by the next mandatory promotion
           board or SSB or
10                                                                            ANGI36-2504 28 JULY 2004


            2.5.2.3.2. The President again removes the officer’s name from the report or the Secretary of
            Defense removes the name from the list.
     2.5.3. Effect of Twice Failing Promotion to Captain, Major, or Lieutenant Colonel. ANG State Head-
     quarters separates and reassigns twice-deferred officers according to AFI 36-3209.
        2.5.3.1. A first lieutenant, twice deferred for promotion to captain, will be separated from the
        ANG not later than the first day of the seventh month after the month the President approved the
        board report of the board that considered the officer for the second time.
        2.5.3.2. A captain, twice deferred for promotion to major and not in a continued status, will be
        separated from the ANG not later than the first day of the seventh month after the month the Pres-
        ident approved the board report of the board that considered the officer for the second time.
        2.5.3.3. A major, twice deferred for promotion to lieutenant colonel and not in a continued status,
        will be removed from the RASL on the first day of the month after the month the officer completes
        20 years of commissioned service or if the officer already has 20 years of commissioned service,
        the officer will be separated from the ANG not later than the first day of the seventh month after
        the month in which the President approved the board report of the board that considered the officer
        for the second time.
        2.5.3.4. Officers, who on the date prescribed for reassignment, separation, or transfer from an
        active status, as required above, are entitled to be credited with at least 18 but less than 20 years of
        satisfactory service for Reserve retirement, will not be involuntarily reassigned, separated, or
        transferred from an active status before meeting the requirements specified in Title 10 USC, Sec-
        tion 12646. Officers who, on the date prescribed for release from active duty (other than for train-
        ing) as required above, are entitled to be credited with at least 18 but less than 20 years of active
        duty for retirement, will not be involuntarily released from active duty (other than for training)
        before becoming eligible for an active duty retirement, or as otherwise specified in Title 10 USC,
        Section 12686.

2.6. Voluntary Delay of Promotion. Due to circumstances beyond an officer’s control, the officer may
be unable to accept a promotion IAW AFI 36-2504, Chapter 8. An officer may apply for a voluntary delay
of promotion in one-year increments for a total of three years from the officer’s original DOR. Each one
year delay requires separate action and approval. An officer must apply for the voluntary delay of promo-
tion before a delay may be approved. The application must be approved through the appropriate channels
before the Date of Rank. The officer must complete an AF IMT 3988, Application for Voluntary Delay,
Acceptance, or Declination of Promotion, and submit to unit commander. The unit commander will for-
ward the form through command channels to the State Adjutant General for approval. SAF delegates the
authority to CNGB, who, in turn, delegates it to the Adjutant Generals (TAGs). State headquarters must
forward the approved application to ANG/DP for update of the MILPDS. ANG/DP will send a copy of the
promotion delay request and approval to HQ ARPC/DPJ. Maintain one copy for the UPRG and provide
the officer one copy. Refer to AFI 36-2504, Chapter 8 for additional guidance for processing of voluntary
delay of promotion applications.

2.7. Involuntary Promotion Delay.
     2.7.1. An involuntary promotion delay will be processed IAW AFI 36-2504 if an officer is selected
     for mandatory promotion and assigned as a full-time military duty officer employed against a Unit
ANGI36-2504 28 JULY 2004                                                                                 11


   Manpower Document, Part A (UMD-A) position that does not support the higher grade. In these
   cases, the commander must submit an AF IMT 3988 through the servicing MPF and TAG to ANG/DP.
   2.7.2. Promotion of an officer on the RASL, serving on active duty, to a grade with strength limita-
   tions set by Title 10 USC, Section 10211 and 12310, can be delayed to ensure compliance with those
   strength limitations. The delay expires when the strength-in-grade limitations no longer apply. If an
   authorized controlled grade commensurate with the higher graded position is not available for imme-
   diate promotion of a full-time military duty officer or statutory tour officer, the officer must complete
   an AF IMT 3988. The AF IMT 3988 will be processed through the servicing MPF and state HQ to
   ANG/DP. The DOR is delayed until the officer obtains a controlled grade or the officer completes the
   tour.
   2.7.3. The completed AF IMT 3988 must arrive 30 days prior to the normal promotion effective date
   in order to prevent inadvertent consummation of the promotion. Upon receipt of the AF IMT 3988, the
   individual’s promotion projection will be adjusted accordingly.
   2.7.4. Date of rank for individuals involuntarily delayed under these circumstances will be the date
   the officer would have originally been promoted, however, the effective date of promotion for pay will
   be the date of Federal recognition or date controlled grade is received, whichever is latest.

2.8. Overgrade Promotion Processing. When promotion results in an overgrade situation, the appropri-
ate overgrade code and expiration date in accordance with ANGI 36-2101 will be entered into the
MILPDS by the supporting MPF.
12                                                                         ANGI36-2504 28 JULY 2004


                                                 Chapter 3

                                 POSITION VACANCY PROMOTION

3.1. General. The ANG position vacancy promotion program is designed to provide officers who have
demonstrated high potential and exceptional abilities with the opportunity for accelerated promotion.
These promotions must be reserved for a very limited number of truly outstanding officers who have dem-
onstrated potential for positions of increased responsibility. Position vacancy promotions are not to be
routinely offered to all officers.
     3.1.1. An officer being considered for promotion by a ROPB will not be considered for a position
     vacancy promotion (refer to paragraph 2.2.). Position vacancy promotion requests arriving at ANG/
     DP after the Mandatory Promotion Eligibility list has been certified to HQ ARPC will be returned
     without action, even when Federal Recognition Examination Boards were held prior to the list being
     certified by the MPF. If selected for promotion by the ROPB and placed on a recommended list, the
     officer may be recommended for promotion in advance of the effective date to fill an authorized posi-
     tion vacancy. The officer will not be required to meet a Federal Recognition Examination Board; how-
     ever, all requirements of paragraphs 3.2. and 3.3. for a position vacancy promotion must be met.
     3.1.2. All officers may be promoted through the grade of major, regardless of the strength in the pro-
     motion competitive category. This includes company grade officers assigned as excess to a position.
     3.1.3. Position vacancy promotion to the grade of major through lieutenant colonel. Projected losses
     cannot be used to promote officers. Officers recommended for position vacancy promotions must be
     the sole occupants of the Unit Manpower Document (UMD) position.
     3.1.4. Position vacancy promotion to the grade of Colonel. Officers considered for position vacancy
     promotion to the grade of colonel must be assigned to an appropriate UMD position, but they do not
     have to be the sole occupant of the position. In such cases, the position incumbent will be designated
     as excess and will be projected for loss/reassignment prior to the anticipated effective date of promo-
     tion. Approval of such assignments must be requested by states and granted by ANG/DP prior to state
     Federal Recognition Examination Board. The officer assigned excess must agree in writing to vacate
     the position at least one day prior to Senate confirmation of individual awaiting promotion.
        3.1.4.1. When determining if an officer is eligible for promotion, states are allowed to promote
        based on overall strength of colonel authorized to a state. Promotions will only be against vali-
        dated colonel authorizations. UMDs will not be changed and states will not be authorized to
        exceed established colonel authorization ceilings.
     3.1.5. Units will not promote officers against a UMD position scheduled for deletion or grade reduc-
     tion in an approved programming plan.

3.2. Position Vacancy Determination.
     3.2.1. The position vacancy must be within the nominee's competitive promotion category, which is
     determined by Duty Air Force Specialty Code (DAFSC). Additionally, the Line category will be
     sub-divided into “rated” and “non-rated” groupings to determine if a vacancy exists. Grade vacancies
     in one category cannot be used for promotion in another category (i.e., a non-rated Air Force Specialty
     Code (AFSC) grade vacancy cannot be used to promote an officer assigned to a rated AFSC position).
     For this purpose, there are nine position vacancy promotion categories.
ANGI36-2504 28 JULY 2004                                                                                13


       3.2.1.1. Rated line officers. Includes all officers authorized and assigned in flying positions,
       except professional officers.
       3.2.1.2. Non-rated line officers. Includes all officers authorized and assigned to non-flying posi-
       tions, except professional officers.
       3.2.1.3. Judge Advocate General's Department.
       3.2.1.4. Chaplain Corps.
       3.2.1.5. Medical Corps.
       3.2.1.6. Medical Service Corps.
       3.2.1.7. Dental Corps.
       3.2.1.8. Nurse Corps.
       3.2.1.9. Biomedical Science Corps.
   3.2.2. All officers assigned to a promotion category (as defined by paragraph 3.2.1.) will be
   accounted for in assigned strength figures per the Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) code as
   reported in the wing/group commander's endorsement to the promotion recommendation letter or the
   automated promotion format (Attachment 7). Officers in excess or overgrade status must be counted
   in determining if a vacancy exists. All officers must be assigned to positions commensurate with their
   grade and DAFSC prior to promoting any other officer via position vacancy. Officers assigned to or
   retained in excess or overgrade status in the following situations will not count in determining if a
   vacancy exists:
       3.2.2.1. A military technician promoted via a mandatory board prior to attaining eligibility for an
       immediate civil service annuity. Such cases will be excluded only when the member is retained in
       a UMD position that is no less than one grade below his/her current grade.
       3.2.2.2. Overgrade officer promoted via the mandatory promotion system with 18 but less than 20
       satisfactory years of service or who have less than three years of promotion service credit in their
       current grade. Upon completion of the satisfactory years of service or time in grade, such officers
       will be retained, released or assigned IAW AFI 36-3209 or ANGI 36-2101.
       3.2.2.3. Other categories as may be announced by ANG/DP to manage the officer force within the
       ANG. Promotion category exceptions will be published in implementing instructions.

3.3. Eligibility Requirements. Nominees’ for Federal recognition of a position vacancy promotion, who
do not meet the requirements, will be returned to the State without action. The requirements are:
   3.3.1. Nominees’ must be recommended for a position vacancy promotion by his/her immediate com-
   mander. The commander will justify the recommendation for promotion in paragraph 3 of the com-
   mander’s promotion recommendation letter (Attachment 6).
   3.3.2. OPRs used for promotion evaluation, as listed in Table 3.1., must be rated “meets standards” in
   all performance elements. Officers appointed from other services must have at least one ANG or
   USAF OPR prior to being recommended for position vacancy promotion. Refer to Table 3.1. for the
   number of OPRs or training reports required.

NOTES:
     1. Substantive comments are defined as documentation of the ratee’s primary duty performance
        written by the assigned raters in the unit's command rating chain. The rater or additional rater
        must address the officer’s ability and potential to perform at the next higher grade.
        2. Professional officers (except medical services corps) may be promoted with only one OPR on
           file.
        3. The requirement for the two most recent ANG or USAF OPRs may be waived by ANG/DP
           for officers who transferred to the ANG from other service components. For a waiver to be
           considered:

            3.1. The officer must have been appointed in the ANG within the preceding two years;
            3.2. The officer must have received one ANG or USAF OPR and it must contain substantive
            comments; and
            3.3. The last two performance reports written on the officer by the previous service compo-
            nents must be attached.
     3.3.3. Nominee must be the only officer assigned to a UMD position authorizing the promotion grade
     (or higher) for which Federal recognition is sought (paragraph 3.1.3.).
     3.3.4. Nominees’ must not be promoted to a grade above that authorized for their UMD-A position,
     nor may the promotion result in the statewide military duty grade ceiling being exceeded unless spe-
     cifically authorized by ANG/DP. (See Attachment 6.)

                            Armed Forces (ICAF), etc.)

        3.3.5.1. Nonresident PME courses of another service in which a member enrolled after 1 April
        1985 are not acceptable for position vacancy promotion if an equivalent Air Force nonresident
        course exists. Waivers will not be granted. PME courses (resident or nonresident) from another
        service, completed by an officer while a member of another service, are acceptable for satisfying
        position vacancy promotion requirements.
        3.3.5.2. Chaplains, lawyers and health professionals are exempt from completing the PME
        requirement for position vacancy promotion to lieutenant colonel and below provided they have

        courses related to their specialty. Completion of Senior Education Development PME (resident,
        seminar or correspondence) is required for chaplains, lawyers, and health professionals for promo-
        tion to Colonel. Commanders must review evidence of the continuing education/professional
        requirements to maintain proficiency and/or credentialing/licensing. In every case, professional

        3.3.5.3. The PME completion requirement for promotion may be waived by NGB/CF for those
        individuals attending the appropriate level course in residence, provided the member is assigned to
        a UMD position authorizing the grade (or higher) for which promotion is recommended. Approval
        of waiver requests will not be automatic and commanders must provide adequate justification that
        the individual attending PME deserves special consideration. Waivers will only be considered for
        officers graduating from PME prior to White House/Senate confirmation.
     3.3.6. Nominees’ must have been awarded the fully qualified DAFSC of the UMD position, unless
     the officer has been reassigned within the last six months and holds a fully qualified primary AFSC

     retired status.
     3.3.10. Line and Medical Service Corps officers must have trained satisfactorily for the two years
     immediately preceding the Federal Recognition Examination Board. Chaplains, lawyers, and health
     professionals recommended for promotion to lieutenant colonel and below must have trained satisfac-
     torily for at least one year immediately preceding the Federal Recognition Examination Board. A sat-
     isfactory year is one in which the officer has satisfied the requirements for a satisfactory year for

     tenant colonel and colonel must have at least three years retainability from the effective date of pro-
     motion to their new grade before any type of mandatory separation from the ANG. The Federal
     Recognition Examination Board should be held at least three and one-half years prior to any manda-
     tory separation date to allow time for processing of the promotion recommendation.
     3.3.16. Nominees’ must be physically qualified for worldwide duty as determined by proper military
     medical authority and have a “Good Fit” score IAW ANGI 10-248, Air National Guard (ANG) Fitness
     Program. The State Air Surgeon may waive any 4T profile where competent military medical author-

     ber being returned to worldwide duty status within one year (e.g., pregnancy).
ANGI36-2504 28 JULY 2004                                                                                  17


   3.3.17. Nominees’ must be approved for Federal recognition by the CNGB after review of the Federal
   Recognition Examination Board proceedings and other records pertaining to the officer.

3.4. Promotion Effective Dates. Promotion effective dates will be determined by ANG/DP, announced
in Federal Recognition Orders, and entered into the MILPDS. Promotion dates are not effective until
announced by such orders or by MILPDS entry.

3.5. Position Vacancy Promotion to Colonel. All nominations (paragraph 3.1.4.) for position vacancy
promotion to colonel will be forwarded to the CNGB, through ANG/DP for review and action as indi-
cated below:
   3.5.1. The complete recommendation will be forwarded to ANG/DP for personnel found qualified by
   a Federal Recognition Examination Board and paragraph 3.1.4. of this instruction. The National
   Guard Bureau will review prior to the convening of the ANG Colonels' Federal Recognition Review
   Board at the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC).
       3.5.1.1. Individuals who meet a Federal Recognition Examination Board between 1 January and
       30 June of each year are eligible to be reviewed by the Fall ANG Colonels Federal Recognition
       Review Board. Board proceedings and endorsements must arrive at ANG/DP not later than 15
       July of each year to be considered by the Fall Board.
       3.5.1.2. Individuals who meet a Federal Recognition Examination Board between 1 July and 31
       December of each year are eligible to be reviewed by the Spring ANG Colonels' Federal Recogni-
       tion Review Board. Board proceedings and endorsements must arrive at ANG/DP not later than 15
       January of each year to be considered by the Spring Board.
   3.5.2. Promotion packages arriving at ANG/DP after the dates stated above will be held for the sub-
   sequent ANG Colonels' Federal Recognition Review Board.
   3.5.3. Federal Recognition Review Board. ANG officers recommended for promotion to colonel must
   meet the ANG Colonel Federal Recognition Review Board convened at the Air Force Personnel Cen-
   ter, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. This board is composed of both active duty Air Force and ANG
   officers and is charged with determining if officers nominated meet the standard for Federal Recogni-
   tion as Colonels in the Total Force. ANG officers not recommended for promotion by this board may
   be resubmitted for promotion after nine months.

3.6. Certificate of Eligibility (COE) for Promotion to Colonel
   3.6.1. The purpose of the certificate of eligibility is to assist the state’s force management plan by
   pre-qualifying officers for a Colonel position and subsequent Federal recognition, thus reducing the
   time it takes to promote individuals to the grade of colonel upon assignment to a vacant colonel posi-
   tion. It must be understood that circumstances are subject to change, therefore, the fact that an individ-
   ual holds a COE does not mandate promotion to the higher grade or warrant mandatory assignment to
   a higher graded position.
   3.6.2. Eligibility. A candidate for a COE must meet all the requirements for consideration for a posi-
   tion vacancy promotion to the grade of colonel except for holding the state appointment to the higher
   grade and assignment to a colonel position.
   3.6.3. Upon announcement by ANG/DP that an ANG Colonel Review Board will be convened, the
   state will submit all required documentation referenced in the announcement and paragraph 4.4., of
18                                                                           ANGI36-2504 28 JULY 2004


     this instruction. In addition to requirements outlined in paragraph 4.4., submit a memorandum speci-
     fying the projected assignment of the candidate for the COE, identifying the current incumbent and
     providing the date and reason the incumbent will vacate the position.
     3.6.4. Validity of COE.
        3.6.4.1. A certificate of eligibility is valid only for the office that the individual was found quali-
        fied by a FRB, unless a waiver for assignment to a commensurate position is approved by ANG/
        DP.
        3.6.4.2. A certificate of eligibility is effective for two years from the date of Senate confirmation.
        The officer must remain otherwise qualified. The COE becomes invalid when one of the following
        conditions occurs:
            3.6.4.2.1. The officer is reassigned to an authorized colonel UMD position prior to release of
            Senate confirmation, or
            3.6.4.2.2. Is no longer physically qualified, or
            3.6.4.2.3. Is removed IAW this instruction, or
            3.6.4.2.4. Reaches his/her MSD and has not been assigned to an authorized colonel UMD
            position. An extension of MSD in order to qualify for a civil service retirement annuity will
            not invalidate an existing COE.
     3.6.5. The message released by ANG/DP announcing Senate confirmation will serve as the COE.
     3.6.6. Executing an approved COE.
        3.6.6.1. Forty-five days prior to assignment to a colonel position of an officer holding a COE, the
        state will provide ANG/DP the following documentation:
            3.6.6.1.1. State assignment order or copy of an AF IMT 2096, Classification/On-The-Job
            Training Action, assigning the officer to the authorized vacant colonel position indicated in the
            original COE promotion request
            3.6.6.1.2. State promotion order
            3.6.6.1.3. New Investigative File Memorandum
            3.6.6.1.4. Statement the officer has a “Good Fit” score IAW ANGI 10-248.
            3.6.6.1.5. Copies of new OPRs rendered since the convening of the Federal recognition board
            3.6.6.1.6. Medical Squadron Commander or State Air Surgeon statement certifying that
            “Examinee denies, and review of medical records fail to reveal, any other significant medical
            or surgical history since last physical examination dated _________.”
        3.6.6.2. Upon receipt of the candidate’s assignment order to the colonel position, ANG/DP will
        initiate a complete files check. Federal recognition by CNGB will be granted only after the files
        check is complete.
     3.6.7. Effective Date of Promotion. For members holding an approved COE, the promotion service
     date and promotion effective date is the date Federal recognition is granted by CNGB. If the member
     is an AGR, CNGB will approve only within statutory limitation of controlled grades.
ANGI36-2504 28 JULY 2004                                                                            19


  3.6.8. Delay of COE execution for Promotion. If an officer holding a COE is the subject of an open
  complaint/investigation involving adverse information, Federal recognition will be withheld and the
  Reserve of the Air Force promotion will be delayed until resolved. If the adverse information is sub-
  stantiated at the time the officer was selected, nominated and confirmed for a COE, the NGB/CF, in
  coordination with the officer’s TAG, will:
     3.6.8.1. Initiate removal from the promotion list IAW AFI 36-2504, or
     3.6.8.2. Recommend to the SAF that the officer be Federally recognized and granted Reserve of
     the Air Force promotion. Such recommendations will be accompanied by a full disclosure of the
     adverse information.

                                     FEDERAL RECOGNITION

4.1. General. Federal recognition and concurrent Reserve of the Air Force promotion is extended to
qualified officers by the CNGB, acting for the Secretary of the Air Force and will be announced in appro-
priate orders. Federal recognition orders for promotions to colonel cannot be issued until the Senate con-
firms the promotions. Federal recognition orders for promotions to lieutenant colonel cannot be issued
until the President approves the promotions or designated authority.

4.2. Promotion as a Result of Mandatory Consideration for Promotion to First Lieutenant. To
request Federal recognition to be effective on the date established by a ROPB or for the mandatory pro-
motion of second lieutenants (paragraph 2.1.), submit automated format IAW Attachment 7.

4.3. Promotions Below Colonel. For position vacancy promotion to the grade of captain through lieu-
tenant colonel and mandatory promotions to first lieutenant, requests (paragraph 4.4.) will be forwarded

4.5. Promotion Propriety Actions.
   4.5.1. Delay or Removal Actions. An officer who has been found fully qualified for promotion by a
   Federal Recognition Examination Board or a ROPB is considered to be on a recommended list for
   promotion to the next higher grade. If subsequent information is made available to TAG or CNGB,
   that causes either to believe an officer is mentally, physically, morally, or professionally unqualified to
   perform the duties of the next higher grade, action must be initiated to delay or remove the officer’s
   name from the recommended list IAW AFI 36-2504, Chapter 7.
   4.5.2. If the reason for the delay no longer exists, promote the officer to the next higher grade with the
   same DOR as if the delay did not occur. Any commander in the officer’s rating chain may determine
   the reason for the delay no longer exists. AFI 36-2504, Table 7.1., Step 12 specifies the appropriate
   process for notifying the member and disposing of the case.
   4.5.3. Not Qualified Actions (Mandatory Promotion). If information is made available to a Com-
   mander that causes him or her to believe an officer is mentally, physically, morally, or professionally
   unqualified to perform the duties of the next higher grade, action should be initiated to find the officer
   not qualified for promotion IAW AFI 36-2504, Chapter 7.

4.6. Automated Promotion Request System. ANG/DP has developed an automated promotion request
process (see Attachment 9). State Headquarters' participation in the ANG/DP Automated Promotion
Request is mandatory. See Attachment 7 for samples of the automated promotion request template,
including position vacancy, ROPB mandatory and accelerated promotions. Contact ANG/DP for email
address of personnel specialist handling promotions for your particular State, Territory or Statutory Tour
Program.

Dear (Grade) (Last Name)


        A Reserve Officer Promotion Board that convened at the Air Reserve Personnel Center recently
considered you for permanent promotion. The board reviewed all documents in each officer's selection
folder using the best-qualified method of selection. Unfortunately, you were not among those recom-
mended for promotion.


        As long as you remain eligible, a Reserve Officer Promotion Board composed of entirely different
members, which will convene next year, will again consider you for promotion. You cannot be considered
for a position vacancy promotion while in a failed of selection for promotion status. If the next Reserve
Officer Promotion Board does not select you for promotion, you must be separated from the ANG unless
authorized retention by law. In the event SAF determines a critical need for officers in your grade and
AFSC, you will be notified and may be eligible to apply for continuation. You are encouraged to review
AFI 36-2504, Officer Promotion and Continuation in the Reserve of the Air Force and use every opportu-
nity to enhance your promotion potential prior to being considered again.


        Request you acknowledge receipt of one copy of this letter and provide it to the Military Personnel
Flight for inclusion in your unit personnel records group.


                                                   Sincerely,

(State) Air National Guard




Dear (Grade. Last Name)


        You were recently reconsidered for permanent promotion by a ROPB, which convened at the Air
Reserve Personnel Center. I regret to inform you that you were not recommended for promotion. The spe-
cific reasons are known only to the composite membership of the board, however, I can assure you that
you were accorded fair and impartial consideration.


        Since you have been considered twice and not recommended, the law requires that your active sta-
tus as an officer in the Air National Guard and as a Reserve of the Air Force be terminated not later than
(date). You should contact the Military Personnel Flight to determine which of the following will apply in
your case:


               a. If you have completed over 20 satisfactory years of service for retirement, you are eligi-
ble and may elect transfer to the Retired Reserve Section. This transfer will not entitle you to pay until you
reach age 60.


              b. If you have more than 18, but less than 20 satisfactory years of service for retirement,
you may qualify for further retention to complete 20 years under the provisions of Section 12646 of Title
10, USC.


       On behalf of the Adjutant General of the State of ________ the Chief, National Guard Bureau, and
the Chief of Staff, United States Air Force, I wish to thank you for your honorable and faithful service.


                                                    Sincerely,
