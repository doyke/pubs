Supersedes SAFBI 32-1006, 14 May 1997.                                                       Pages: 5
                                                                                      Distribution: F

This instruction establishes standards and procedures to control peak electrical demand. The initiation
and accomplishment of the established procedures are intended to minimize the Scott AFB peak electrical
demand, conserve electrical energy, and reduce utility cost during the summer cooling season (Jun
through Sep) when the electrical utility rate is highest. It applies to all organizations and personnel who
work or reside on Scott AFB IL.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This revision deletes HQ AWS from Atch 1 and adds the 126 ARW--no content change.

1. General. During the cooling season, the daily period of peak electrical demand consumption occurs
between 1000 and 1600. The peak electrical demand is determined by the highest measured electrical
demand recorded during any 15-minute on-peak period. The on-peak period is between the 11 consecu-
tive hours commencing at 1000 and ending at 2100, Mon-Fri, 1 Jun-30 Sep, excluding the 4th of July and
Labor Day. Demand charges during these 4 months account for approximately 46 percent of the total bill
for this time period. The purpose of this instruction is to minimize these demand charges through system-
atic reduction in nonessential power requirements. The maximum peak electrical demand will be the
highest peak electrical demand previously recorded within the past 12 months.

2. Responsibilities. Responsibilities for notifying and accomplishing peak electrical demand controls are
listed as follows:
   2.1. Monitoring Procedures. The Civil Engineering (CE) Energy Management and Control System
   (EMCS) operator will be responsible for monitoring the electrical demand remote meters. Civil Engi-
   neering will establish a checklist to be followed that will include as a minimum:
       2.1.1. Operating instructions for monitoring equipment.
2                                                                    SAFBI32-1006 18 November 2000

       2.1.2. Minimum electrical demand to initiate agency notification. Notification will begin when
       demand reaches 15 percent less than the highest previous peak electrical demand occurring within
       the previous
       12-month period, unless directed to use a different level by the Energy Steering Group.
       2.1.3. Maximum demand allowed. The previous peak electrical demand will be the maximum
       allowed, unless directed to use a different level by the Energy Steering Group.
       2.1.4. Telephone notification roster.
       2.1.5. Termination of control procedures.
    2.2. Notification Procedures. The CE Service Call Specialist and/or the EMCS operator will be
    responsible for initiating and terminating control procedures. The CE specialist/operator will notify
    the agencies as listed in Attachment 1, to include the Base Operations dispatcher, who will initiate the
    Secondary Crash Phone System and repeat the message. The initial notification by the CE specialist/
    operator will state: “This is an electrical peak demand notification. Initiate control procedures
    according to SAFBI 32-1006.”
    2.3. Internal Notification Procedures. Each organization will establish an operating instruction (OI)/
    checklist to ensure compliance with control procedures as outlined by this instruction. This OI/check-
    list is critical and should be designed to ensure that the total implementation times of all agencies
    within the organization do not exceed 15 minutes due to peak demand charge determined by the high-
    est electrical demand during any 15-minute period as stated in para 1. Each organization should peri-
    odically test their procedures to ensure they work. Should problems exist to prevent implementation
    within the designated time, notification should be submitted to the Base Energy Manager. The OI
    checklist should be reviewed and updated annually. A copy should be submitted to the Base Energy
    Manager,375 CES/CEOE, for review and the 375 CES/CEO for approval. The OI checklist should
    include as a minimum:
       2.3.1. Office of primary responsibility who will monitor and update procedures.
       2.3.2. Point of contact (POC) in each agency that must be notified and actual notification proce-
       dures.
       2.3.3. Control procedures (in a checklist-type format) to be used by each POC for continual mon-
       itoring, until the electrical peak demand notification is terminated. Each organization will include
       in their OI those energy conservation items that are unique to their office, any or all of the control
       procedures items listed in para 2.4. as they pertain to them, and identify the kilowatt reduction
       possible through these procedures.
    2.4. Control Procedures. Upon receipt of peak electrical demand notification, all organizations will
    decrease their electrical demand as follows (except for mission-essential aircraft operation or mainte-
    nance, mission planning, critical administrative support), AFOSH (life, safety, or health), and techni-
    cal order requirements:
       2.4.1. All areas, to include administrative, hangar, and shop (except for mission-essential,
       AFOSH, and technical order requirements):
           2.4.1.1. Window air conditioners. In areas that have access to outside windows, turn to OFF.
           In areas that have no other means of ventilation, turn to ventilation only. For areas that have
           mission-essential cooling requirements, turn to low cool.
SAFBI32-1006 18 November 2000                                                                          3

         2.4.1.2. Lights in rooms with exterior windows -- OFF.
         2.4.1.3. Coffeemakers and any small appliance-type devices -- OFF.
         2.4.1.4. Office copiers -- OFF.
         2.4.1.5. Computer systems that are not considered absolutely essential -- OFF.
         2.4.1.6. Watercoolers -- OFF.
         2.4.1.7. Radios -- OFF (or on battery operation).
         2.4.1.8. Fans -- OFF (or switch to lowest setting where necessary for ventilation only, not
         comfort cooling).
         2.4.1.9. Reset all thermostats for a room temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit (except for
         mission required environmentally controlled areas).
     2.4.2. Shop areas must also decrease electrical demand as follows (except for mission, AFOSH,
     and technical order requirements):
         2.4.2.1. Discontinue arc welding.
         2.4.2.2. Discontinue charging batteries in Battery Shop.
         2.4.2.3. Reschedule nonmission tasks requiring large electrical requirements to work shifts
         where work can be started and finished prior to 1000 and/or after 1600, or on holidays or
         weekends.
  2.5. Comfort Air Conditioning. Turn off comfort air conditioning in base facilities, as required, to
  maintain electrical demand below peak level. Do not reset until the electrical peak demand decreases
  below the notification level. The shut-off of comfort cooling will only be performed as the last effort
  in the event the initial notification procedures are not sufficient to reduce the peak demand level.
  *Use generator power as an alternative to turning off comfort air conditioning (where possible and
  without interruption to mission operation). Civil Engineering personnel will work with those organi-
  zations possessing this capability to provide adequate notification and perform generator checks.
  2.6. Computer Systems Operations. It shall be the responsibility of all computer systems officers to
  delay optional batch processing and minimize the use of machine room peripheral devices between
  1000 and 1600, consistent with mission requirements. All equipment not required for mission accom-
  plishment should be powered down if there is no risk of damage.
  2.7. Golf Course. Maintenance personnel will turn off the irrigation pumping stations for the golf
  course irrigation. Golf course personnel will discontinue charging golf cart batteries.
  2.8. Housing Areas. The base Emergency Siren/Giant Voice System, along with Security Forces will
  announce the need for electrical peak power control in all housing areas. Occupants will be asked to
  minimize use of electricity until 1700, unless otherwise notified by Security Forces personnel.
