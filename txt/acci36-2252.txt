                                           Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This instruction establishes policy and guidance for developing training task lists
(TTL), syllabi and other syllabus-related documents for formal operations training of weapons
systems and other specialty training courses within Air Combat Command (ACC).
     1.1.1. HQ ACC Director of Operations (A3). HQ ACC/A3 is the executive authority for
     all ACC operations training programs.
     1.1.2. HQ ACC Training Support Squadron (HQ ACC TRSS). HQ ACC TRSS is the
     single point of contact for formal operations training development within ACC. HQ ACC
     TRSS Training Development Flight (TDF) is the action office for command-level
     coordination of TTLs and syllabi.
     1.1.3. Applicability. This instruction applies to all agencies developing formal operations
     training publications.
        1.1.3.1. Must - Indicates a mandatory requirement.
        1.1.3.2. Will - Indicates a mandatory requirement.
        1.1.3.3. Should - Indicates a preferred or recommended method or option.
        1.1.3.4. May - Indicates an acceptable or satisfactory method or option.
1.2. Responsibilities.
     1.2.1. HQ ACC/A3 Division. Has overall staff responsibility for the weapons systems they
     manage (e.g., HQ ACC/A3C, A3T). Coordinates on TTLs and syllabi during approval
     processing.
     1.2.2. Functional Area Manager (FAM). Provides subject matter expertise to review
     TTLs and syllabi. Attachment 2 of ACCI 36-2250, ACC Operations Training Development
     Program, lists ACC weapons systems FAM. The FAM is the office of primary responsibility
     (OPR) for the specified TTLs and syllabi.
     1.2.3. HQ ACC TRSS. Has overall developmental responsibility for formal operations
     training courses. Tasks the operations training development teams, monitors revision
     suspenses, screens prepared TTLs and syllabi for compliance with this instruction and
     manages any required changes to ACC TRSS-managed formal contract aircrew
     training/courseware development (CAT/CWD) contracts. Sends the release message
     announcing the approved use of new or revised TTLs and syllabi. Posts approved TTLs and
     syllabi     on       the      ACC    TRSS      Training     Development       SharePoint
     (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-ED-AC-02/default.aspx). Maintains a non-record set of
     TTL and syllabus approval documentation until superseded or rescinded IAW the AF
     Records Disposition Schedule.
     1.2.4. Operations Training Development (OTD) Team. HQ ACC/A3 designates an OTD
     team for each weapons system and other unique formal training courses. See Attachment 2
     for designated OTD teams.
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                    5


     1.2.4.1. OTD teams usually consist of personnel assigned to ACC TRSS detachments. If
     there is no ACC TRSS detachment assigned to the weapons system, a formal training unit
     (FTU) or other unit associated with the weapons system may be designated to perform
     the OTD team functions. In cases where an ACC TRSS detachment has collateral
     responsibility for TTL or syllabus development, the schoolhouse performs the OTD
     functions (e.g., USAF Weapons School). The OTD team includes an instructional
     systems specialist and/or education and training experts who are trained to apply
     Instructional Systems Development (ISD) principles and procedures in the development
     of TTLs, syllabi and supporting documents, and instructor-qualified subject matter
     experts (SMEs). OTD teams call on SMEs at the local wing, unit, FTU and/or contract
     aircrew training/courseware development (CAT/CWD) personnel and ACC staff levels,
     as appropriate to assist with syllabi and courseware development and review. Matters
     concerning education or training design or development will defer to the instructional
     systems specialist or education and training expertise. Technical matters will defer to
     SME expertise.
     1.2.4.2. The OTD team is the office of primary developmental responsibility (OPDR) for
     formal operations training publications. They develop position-specific TTLs and syllabi
     that support specific TTLs IAW this instruction. They may also produce supporting
     documents and courseware based on capability. All ACC training documents and
     courseware will be produced IAW ISD publications.
     1.2.4.3. The OTD team coordinates draft formal operations training documents with the
     local FTU operations group commander (OG/CC) or equivalent. They provide a
     sanitized copy (i.e., no tracked changes or comments attached) of the draft TTL and
     syllabus to HQ ACC TRSS for command-level coordination and approval.
     1.2.4.4. The OTD team establishes, maintains, and disposes of TTL and syllabus record
     sets IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule.
     1.2.4.5. The OTD team is responsible for TTL and syllabus distribution, primarily by
     electronic means. Syllabus users are responsible for printing required copies.
     1.2.4.6. The OTD team approves syllabus-related documents (except TTLs) as
     necessary.
     1.2.4.7. The OTD team has overall responsibility for course validation. They may be
     assisted by the FTU and/or CAT/CWD personnel. They monitor new lessons for a
     minimum of three classes and analyze student feedback, training development or
     instructor comments, all measurement data, etc., to determine if course design,
     instruction, equipment and materials meet lesson objectives. Analysis should substantiate
     that time allocations and objectives are appropriate, especially for self-paced, supervised
     study, and directed study portions. Report findings at a periodic curriculum meeting or
     syllabus review.
  1.2.5. FTU Operations Group Commander or Equivalent. Reviews and coordinates on
  draft TTLs and draft syllabi. Implements HQ ACC/A3-approved syllabi according to the
  direction and authority stated in the respective syllabi. May substitute equivalent training
  that complies with the direction and intent of the HQ ACC/A3-approved syllabus.

     1.2.6. Formal Training Unit. For the purposes of this instruction, a unit that conducts
     training using ACC syllabi is an FTU. The FTU:
        1.2.6.1. Conducts training IAW the appropriate HQ ACC/A3-approved syllabus.
        Follows the syllabus guidance when deviations are required, or requests a waiver from
        the designated waiver authority.
        1.2.6.2. Provides OTD team with expertise in the conduct, administration and changes
        required to current training strategies as members of the Syllabus Review Board.
        1.2.6.3. Will assist in syllabus development, and with syllabus-related course document
        development as directed by the OTD Team.
     1.2.7. 436th Training Squadron. Functions as a specialized schoolhouse. Develops
     training courses and materials for the ACC Instructional Systems Development Principles
     Course, Classroom Instructor Course and other unique training programs. Performs all FTU,
     OTD team and FTU OG/CC functions for their unique training programs.
1.3. Software Standardization. Training task lists, syllabi and syllabus-related documents will
be prepared using software compatible with the current Air Force standard desktop
configuration.
1.4. Waivers. HQ ACC/A3 is the Tier waiver authority for Tier-2 compliance requirements in
this instruction. HQ ACC TRSS/CC is the Tier waiver authority for Tier-3 or non-tiered
compliance requirements in this instruction. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms
Management, for a description of the Tier numbers. Send waiver requests through
HQ ACC/TRSS Training Development Flight.

                                           Chapter 2

                                  TRAINING TASK LISTS

2.1. General.
   2.1.1. A Universal Joint Task List (UJTL) is prescribed by CJCSI 3500.02B, Universal Joint
   Task List Program, and is the authoritative list of all approved joint tasks for the Department
   of Defense. The Air Force Universal Task List (AFUTL) expands on the UJTL to include
   Air Force unique tasks. The AF Major Commands (MAJCOMs) establish mission essential
   tasks (MET) and associated mission essential competencies (MECs). ACC training task lists
   (TTLs) support the MECs by defining training requirements for skill sets supporting ACC
   weapons systems combat capability.
   2.1.2. TTL developers use the Air Force Instructional Systems Development principles in
   the Air Force Handbook (AFH) 36-2235 series and this instruction to develop ACC TTLs.
   The TTL documents the training requirements linked to formal training programs. The TTL
   is a management tool for developing syllabi and training programs. Courseware designers
   develop detailed objectives IAW the AFH 36-2235 series guidelines for each training task
   identified in the TTL.
   2.1.3. The 29th Training Systems Squadron uses TTLs to perform the critical tasks of
   verification and validation during acquisition and development of aircrew or mission crew
   training devices. TTLs are used during initial fielding and recurring test and evaluations in
   support of the ACC Simulator Certification (SIMCERT) Program. These evaluations are
   performed to ensure training devices are maintained to their design configuration and provide
   accurate and credible aircrew training consistent with the Mission Design Series (MDS)
   Volume 1 instruction.
2.2. TTL Development. The OTD team is responsible for developing and maintaining TTLs
IAW this chapter. The TTL should be for a crew-specific position of a weapons system. The
OTD team gathers pertinent information required to accomplish formal operations training to
include training planning team inputs, system training plan revisions, training system
requirements analysis results, combatant commander’s expectations, Graduate Evaluation
feedback, etc. Unit-supplemented TTL items should be considered for inclusion during TTL
revision. The OTD team will review the associated MDS Volume 1 training programs (e.g.,
initial qualification training [IQT], mission qualification training [MQT] and upgrade training
[UGT]) and MDS Volume 2 evaluation criteria to determine training requirements. The OTD
team will conduct a task analysis and verify all training tasks are current with the mission
requirements. Skills maintenance or proficiency training (e.g., Ready Aircrew Program [RAP]
tasking events) will not be included in the TTL.
2.3. General TTL Organization. All TTLs require a cover, introduction, summary of
revisions, table of contents and distribution pages. General instructions paragraphs 1.1 through
1.7, table 1.1, and attachments 1 and 2 are mandatory and have reserved titles and specific
content requirements. Use additional paragraphs as necessary to accommodate the unique
requirements of a particular weapons system. Follow the format prescribed in Attachment 4.

2.4. TTL Approval.
     2.4.1. Process. The TTL approval process is fully outlined in Attachment 3.
     2.4.2. Coordination. The OTD team will coordinate the draft TTL with local agencies and
     the implementing group commander. Evidence of applicable OG/CC or equivalent
     coordination must be sent with the TTL submission. Command-level coordination and
     processing will not begin until HQ ACC TRSS/TDF receives this coordination. For weapons
     systems without a unique implementing operations group, such as the Battle Control Center
     (BCC), the OTD team will establish other procedures with the concurrence of HQ ACC
     TRSS to satisfy the coordination requirement. (T-3)
     2.4.3. Command Review and Approval. HQ ACC TRSS/TDF processes the TTL for
     command staff agency coordination and approval processing. HQ ACC/A3 delegates TTL
     approval authority to the HQ ACC TRSS Commander.
     2.4.4. TTL Distribution. The TTL OPDR is responsible for TTL distribution IAW the
     published distribution listing in the respective TTL. Distribution will be accomplished
     primarily using electronic means.
     2.4.5. TTL Releasability. Access to TTLs is restricted. The OPDR may release the TTL to
     Department of Defense (DoD) and US DoD contractors only for administrative or
     operational use. Refer other requests for TTLs to the OPDR for staffing for HHQ approval
     processing.
2.5. TTL Review Cycle. The TTL OPR and OPDR will review the TTL in conjunction with
the biennial syllabus review, or sooner if weapons system changes necessitate earlier review.
When the TTL review is conducted in conjunction with a syllabus review, the TTL review will
be documented within the syllabus review board minutes. If the TTL review is conducted
outside of a syllabus review board, the OTD team will document the review in a memorandum
that includes the TTL title, date of review, a list of reviewers and a summary of projected
changes. If no changes are required, include a statement of no change in the syllabus review
board minutes or TTL review memorandum. Submit the minutes or memorandum to HQ ACC
TRSS/TDF and file the documentation in the TTL record set. (T-3)
2.6. TTL Changes. Units may supplement approved TTLs with additional unit-level
requirements. Units will forward any unit-supplemented tasks to the TTL OPDR for possible
inclusion in future TTL revisions. This process should eliminate the need to change the TTL
until the next syllabus review or major weapons system modification.
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                        9

                      FORMAL OPERATIONS TRAINING SYLLABI

3.1. General. ACC formal operations training syllabi are specialized publications authorized
for issue by the HQ ACC/A3 and are listed in Air Force Education and Training Course
Announcements (ETCA) at site: https://etca.randolph.af.mil. Each syllabus outlines a course
of instruction, is directive in nature and is a reference for conducting specified training in order
to standardize training and ensure quality. Instructors and students use a syllabus as a source
document to determine specific training guidance and course content. HQ staff agencies use
syllabi to plan, program and budget for manning, funding and materials to support formal
operations training. The FTU OG/CC implements training according to the authority and
direction outlined in the syllabus. The goal of formal training is to ensure each graduate
possesses the skills, knowledge and proficiencies specified in course objectives.
3.2. Syllabus Development. For each new or revised course, the OTD team gathers all updated
information pertinent to syllabus development. These may include graduate evaluation data,
TTLs, combatant commander’s expectations, syllabus review minutes, weapons system MDS
Volume 1 requirements, etc. The syllabus OPR will conduct a syllabus review with the
assistance of the OTD team IAW ACCI 36-2250, ACC Operations Training Development
Program. The OTD team will prepare a syllabus for each ACC formal operations training
course. Develop all syllabi IAW AFMAN 36-2234, Instructional System Development; AFH 36-
2235, Volume 8, Information for Designers of Instructional Systems, Application to Aircrew
Training; or AFH 36-2235, Volume 10, Information for Designers of Instructional Systems,
Application to Education; and this instruction. (T-3)
   3.2.1. Multi-Course/Track Syllabi. A syllabus may contain more than one course or track
   to illustrate the relationship between similar courses or material. In this case, the OTD team
   is responsible for designing a presentation scheme enabling ready identification of
   information required in chapters 3, 4, and 5 of a syllabus (see paragraph 3.3.3) for each
   course or track. See AFH 36-2235, Volume 8, for a definition of multi-track courses. Tracks
   within a requalification syllabus may use the same nomenclature for the tracks as stated in
   AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training (i.e., TX-1, TX-2 or TX-3).
3.3. General Syllabus Organization. All syllabi require a cover, introduction, summary of
revisions, table of contents and distribution pages. Within all syllabi, chapters 1 through 5 and
attachments 1 and 2 are mandatory. Each chapter has mandatory sections and paragraphs, with
reserved titles as indicated below. Use additional attachments, chapters, and sections as
necessary to accommodate the unique requirements of a particular course. See format and
guidance in Attachment 8. (T-3)
   3.3.1. Chapter 1, Course Accounting. This chapter is a rapid reference to the dimensions
   of the course prescribed by the syllabus. There are five mandatory sections in this chapter.
   See format and guidance in Attachment 8, paragraph A8.7. (T-3)
       3.3.1.1. Section 1A, Course Description. Include separate paragraphs containing
       course title/number/supported training task list, course entry prerequisites, course purpose
       and graduate status, active duty service commitment, location, duration, and number of
       training hours.

     3.3.1.2. Section 1B, Academic Training Inventory. This tabular inventory shows the
     course academic events to include course-related ancillary training events and any
     advanced distributed learning (ADL) events, and identifies whether the event is
     instructor-led or self-paced training, as applicable.
     3.3.1.3. Section 1C, Device (or Part-Task) Training Inventory. This tabular inventory
     identifies each device or part-task training session.
     3.3.1.4. Section 1D, Flying (or Full-Mission or Operator Mission) Training
     Inventory. This tabular inventory identifies each flying, full-mission, or operator
     mission/event to include sortie or mission identification, mission hours, support hours
     (for student mission planning, briefing, debriefing), unit direct support sorties and hours,
     and other support requirements (e.g., tanker support), as applicable.
     3.3.1.5. Section 1E, Weapons Inventory. This inventory shows munition requirements
     for both student and direct support sorties, and range requirements.
  3.3.2. Chapter 2, Course Management. There are four mandatory sections in this chapter.
  See format and guidance in Attachment 8, paragraph A8.8. (T-3)
     3.3.2.1. Section 2A, Course Training Standards. This section establishes the training
     system policies. It defines academic training standards, performance grading criteria, and
     the performance training standards to describe the minimum performance required to
     progress through the various blocks or phases of the course and graduate.
     3.3.2.2. Section 2B, General Instructions. This section provides overall authority and
     program requirements. Mandatory paragraph titles include approval authority, waiver
     authority, graduation requirements, commander’s authority and training records
     management. Other paragraphs detailing other program requirements may be included.
     Consult the appropriate MDS Volume 1 for the weapons system and other pertinent
     documents to ensure specific guidance from those documents is included in the general
     instructions.
        3.3.2.2.1. Approval Authority. HQ ACC/A3 is the approval authority for all ACC
        formal operations training syllabi. With the exception of administrative changes (see
        paragraph 3.9.1), syllabus approval authority is never delegated.
        3.3.2.2.2. Waiver Authority. HQ ACC/A3 is the waiver authority for all ACC
        formal operations training syllabi. Waiver authority may be delegated in whole or
        part to other agencies. Waiver authority will not be delegated below the operations
        group commander or equivalent level. If HQ ACC/A3 agrees to delegate waiver
        authority, the conditions of delegation must be specifically stated within the
        applicable paragraph of the syllabus. State the action office to staff waiver requests.
            3.3.2.2.2.1. Overall Syllabus Waiver Authority. Overall syllabus waiver
            authority is generally not delegated below the HQ ACC Division (3-letter) level.
            Delegation below this level requires specific justification in the executive
            summary during syllabus approval processing.
            3.3.2.2.2.2. Course Entry Prerequisites. Prerequisite waiver authority is
            generally not delegated below the HQ ACC Branch (4-letter) level. Delegation
            below this level requires specific justification in the executive summary during
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                   11


            syllabus approval processing.
            3.3.2.2.2.3. Training Completion/Events. The syllabus waiver authority may
            waive training completion events or tasks. The FTU OG/CC may defer
            unaccomplished training tasks to the gaining unit. The FTU OG/CC, if not the
            gaining unit OG/CC, or equivalent, will coordinate with the gaining unit OG/CC,
            or equivalent, on all training deferments. The graduate will be unqualified in
            deferred tasks until completed by the gaining unit. A copy of all training
            completion/events waivers and deferments will be sent to the syllabus OPR within
            10 working days of approval.
        3.3.2.2.3. Commander’s Authority. The FTU OG/CC, or equivalent, is responsible
        for conducting the training specified under the authority and direction of the syllabus.
        The FTU OG/CC may substitute equivalent training that complies with the direction
        and intent of the syllabus. The FTU OG/CC or FTU squadron commander (if
        delegated by the FTU OG/CC) may authorize deviations in the order of training to
        meet special weather and peculiar local conditions. Deviations will be consistent
        with good training management, student progress and student experience level.
        However, all prerequisite training must be accomplished before associated device or
        flying training.
        3.3.2.2.4. Training Record Maintenance. All training records will be maintained
        IAW the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule and other directives that govern
        training record maintenance such as ACCI 11-464, Training Records and
        Performance Evaluation in Formal Flying Training Programs.
     3.3.2.3. Section 2C, Special Instructions. This section includes special instructions for
     syllabus implementation; e.g., training strategy, course mechanics, alternate missions,
     source documents, syllabus mission leadership, safety policies, unique syllabus features,
     extended periods of non-flying; proficiency advancement, substandard performance,
     extra sortie policies and limits, progress checks, corrective actions and elimination
     procedures. Consult the appropriate MDS Volume 1 and other pertinent documents to
     ensure specific guidance from those documents is included in special instructions.
     3.3.2.4. Section 2D, Course Flow. This section identifies the recommended and/or
     required order of training, lesson sequencing, time phasing and prerequisites of phases,
     blocks, modules, sorties, sessions and lessons, etc. Address any training constraints that
     affect course flow, such as training devices limitations, aircraft sortie generation
     limitations, etc. Use course maps and management flow charts supported by appropriate
     descriptive commentary and symbol keys to present this information.
        3.3.2.4.1. Relationship of Syllabus Course Duration to Graduation Date. The
        result of the management flow chart is the basis for the number of training days
        (ground, flying and other training days) shown in the course duration in chapter 1 of
        the syllabus. The course duration is based on optimal training of a nominal class size
        within preprogrammed resource constraints. It does not include external factors such
        as sortie attrition (student non-progression, maintenance, weather), holidays, ACC
        Family Days, wing training days, safety days, wingman days, unit compliance
        inspections, Comprehensive Airmen Fitness and Sexual Assault Prevention/Response
        training days, etc. Managers can estimate the graduation date by starting with the
12                                                           ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014


         class start date and pairing the course duration to scheduled operations and
         maintenance (O&M) days, and then adding sufficient days to account for historical or
         anticipated external factors.
  3.3.3. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 Training. These mandatory chapters provide a synopsis of
  academic, device and flying training respectively. They contain special instructions to define
  further guidance and document the training strategy, limitations, training rules, etc., not
  contained in other parts of the syllabus. They provide general training event descriptions of
  each lesson, session or sortie. Within the syllabus, the optimum mix of simulated versus
  actual flying missions will be shown, understanding that resource availability and actual
  training needs may dictate adjusting the proportion of simulated versus actual flying events.
  The following paragraphs define chapter-specific requirements.
     3.3.3.1. Chapter 3 Academic Training. Chapter 3 addresses academic training to
     include platform academics, computer-based training, advanced distributed learning,
     tours, instructor-led demonstrations, self-study, examinations, etc. There are two
     mandatory sections.        Section 3A, Special Instructions, defines general facility
     requirements (classroom, learning center, etc.), instructional method/media (lecture,
     seminar, computer-based training, ADL, etc.), designed instructor requirement
     (instructor/student ratio), designed student load (maximum class capacity) and academic
     evaluations. Section 3B, Academic Training Descriptions, defines the academic lesson
     content. See guidance in Attachment 8, paragraph A8.9. (T-3)
     3.3.3.2. Chapter 4 Device (or Part-Task) Training. Chapter 4 addresses training
     conducted using part-task training devices, simulators, ground configured aircraft and the
     like. Either address all simulated flying training in this chapter as “Device Training,” or
     extract all full-mission simulated flying training to include in chapter 5, therefore naming
     this chapter as “Part-Task Training.” There are two mandatory sections. Section 4A,
     Special Instructions, defines general device and facility requirements, instructional
     method/media, instructor requirements and performance evaluation instructions. Section
     4B, Device Training Session Descriptions, or Part-Task Training Session Descriptions,
     defines the training session content. See guidance in Attachment 8, paragraph A8.10.
     (T-3)
     3.3.3.3. Chapter 5 Flying (Full-Mission or Operator Mission) Training. Chapter 5
     addresses all flying training, full-mission simulated training, or advanced operator
     mission training, as applicable. Title chapter as “Flying Training” when it contains only
     flying training events. Title chapter as “Full-Mission Training” when it includes training
     conducted during actual flying missions as well as full-mission ground simulation events
     in simulators or ground configured aircraft. For ground-based systems, title chapter as
     “Operator Mission Training.” There are two mandatory sections. Section 5A, Special
     Instructions, outlines and clarifies any unique requirements and evaluation instructions.
     Section 5B, Mission Descriptions, defines the mission content. See guidance in
     Attachment 8, paragraph A8.11. (T-3)
  3.3.4. Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information. This
  attachment identifies the references, abbreviations and acronyms and terms used within the
  syllabus.
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                  13


   3.3.5. Attachment 2, Syllabus-Related Document Inventory. This inventory is mandatory
   for all syllabi except 436 TS managed syllabi. Include an inventory of all syllabus-related
   documents (see Chapter 4). Syllabus-related documents will be reviewed during Staff
   Assistance Visits. See guidance in Attachment 8, paragraph A8.14.
   3.3.6. Additional Chapters and/or Attachments. Include additional chapters and/or
   attachments to meet unique syllabus requirements. Note: Criterion-referenced objectives
   will be included or referenced within the syllabus; see options at paragraph A8.12. (T-3)
3.4. Syllabus Approval.
   3.4.1. Process. The syllabus review process is fully outlined in Attachment 5.
   3.4.2. Executive Summary. The OTD team prepares the executive summary to facilitate
   general officer review and approval of the syllabus. An executive summary is required for
   all syllabus submissions except administrative changes. See format in Attachment 9. (T-3)
   3.4.3. Coordination. The OTD team will coordinate with local agencies and the
   implementing group commander. Evidence of applicable OG/CC or equivalent coordination
   will be sent with the syllabus submission (T-3). Command-level coordination and
   processing will not begin until HQ ACC TRSS/TDF receives this coordination. For weapons
   systems without a unique implementing operations group, such as the BCC, the OPDR will
   establish other procedures with the concurrence of ACC TRSS to satisfy the coordination
   requirement.
   3.4.4. Command Review and Approval. HQ ACC TRSS/TDF processes the syllabus for
   command staff agency coordination and approval processing. HQ ACC/A3 is the approval
   authority for all formal operations training syllabi (see paragraph 3.9.1 for administrative
   change approvals).
   3.4.5. Syllabus Distribution. The syllabus OPDR is responsible for syllabus distribution
   IAW the published distribution in the respective syllabus. Distribution will be accomplished
   primarily using electronic means.
   3.4.6. Syllabus Releasability. Access to formal course syllabi is restricted. The OPDR may
   release the syllabus to DoD and US DoD contractors only for administrative or operational
   use. Refer other requests for syllabi to the OPDR for staffing for HHQ approval processing.
   (T-3)
3.5. Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements Updates. After receiving
the syllabus release message, the syllabus OTD team will prepare and submit an email request
through the syllabus OPR to HQ ACC/A1KE to create or update course announcements in the
ETCA website, as required. Instructions are posted on the ACC TRSS Training Development
SharePoint. It is not necessary to coordinate this action with HQ ACC TRSS. The syllabus
OTD team should notify the syllabus OPR if the ETCA updates are not posted within 60 days.
3.6. Currency. Individual users are responsible to ensure they are using the most current copy
of all HQ ACC/A3-approved syllabi. Users may verify the currency of their syllabi by
contacting the syllabus OPDR. The syllabus OPDR maintains an index of all current syllabi and
related documents for which they are responsible.
 14                                                           ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014


3.7. Syllabus Implementation. FTU Operations Group Commanders, or equivalent, will
implement formal operations training syllabi according to the authority and direction stated in
the respective syllabus. Do not use draft syllabi (T-2).
3.8. Syllabus Review Cycle. The syllabus OPR and OTD team will review each syllabus every
24 months or sooner if weapons system changes, course critiques or other data necessitate earlier
review. The OTD team completes minutes of the syllabus review, forwards a copy of the
minutes to the syllabus OPR and ACC TRSS/TDF, and files the minutes in the syllabus record
set. See ACCI 36-2250 for syllabus review procedures and documentation requirements.
3.9. Out-of-Cycle Syllabus Changes. HQ ACC/A3-approved operations training syllabi are
formal courses to be executed as published. They will not be altered or changed without due
regard, thorough coordination and proper approval. Before submitting a request to alter a formal
operations training course, the OTD team should consider if the implementing OG/CC can
authorize substituting alternative training that provides equivalent training under the authority
and direction of the existing syllabus. When equivalent substitution is not feasible, consider
obtaining a waiver from the syllabus waiver authority. When a waiver is not possible or feasible,
consider a syllabus change.
   3.9.1. Administrative changes that have no increase in the number of training days and result
   in no increase in the number of sorties, seldom require a formal change to the syllabus.
   Examples of administrative changes include revising course prerequisites, adjustments to
   event training hours, reallocation of training tasks and changes to the order of training. HQ
   ACC/A3 delegates approval authority for administrative changes to the HQ ACC TRSS
   commander.
   3.9.2. A formal change is required when revisions are made that exceed administrative
   changes, increase total training days, increase the number of flying sorties, have safety
   issues, or include major system modifications or changes. Formal changes require HQ
   ACC/A3 approval.
   3.9.3. Submit recommendations for change directly to the syllabus OPDR. The OTD team
   will evaluate the proposal and consult with the ACC weapons system functional area
   manager (syllabus OPR) to determine if and/or when to implement the change. The FAM
   may reject the change request, concur with the change request but direct that it be held until
   the next formal revision cycle, or concur with the change and direct an out-of-cycle change.
   If directed to make the out-of-cycle change, the OTD team will prepare and submit the
   change document (see format in Attachment 10) with evidence of the FAM direction to make
   the change, and evidence of OG/CC coordination to HQ ACC TRSS/TDF for command-level
   coordination and approval processing. (T-3)

                          SYLLABUS-RELATED DOCUMENTS

4.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for syllabus-related documents created to support
ACC formal operations training courses. Operational units use syllabus-related documents as
reference materials to support the syllabus. Syllabus-related documents do not include aircraft
technical orders, equipment operations manuals, regulations or instructions.
   4.1.1. Training/Phase Manuals. These manuals pertain to the specific tasks, objectives and
   goals of the phases of training they relate to in the formal school environment. These
   manuals present behavior-oriented techniques and procedures to help students achieve
   desired proficiency levels. OTD teams will assist with training/phase manual development in
   support of ACC formal operations training syllabi as needed. A copy will be provided to the
   weapons system FAM.
   4.1.2. Textbooks. Use these documents during the study of a particular subject or subjects
   in an academic (as opposed to flying) environment. They are known as academic,
   instructional, reference or programmed texts.
   4.1.3. Guides and Workbooks. These documents are learning aids that provide additional
   information to support various instructional methods or interactive exercises on selected
   topics, such as study guides, briefing and mission study guides, instructor guides, student
   guides and workbooks.
   4.1.4. Training Task List. TTLs define the formal training requirements for skill set
   development for specific crew positions (see Chapter 2).
   4.1.5. Criterion-Referenced Objectives (CRO). The CROs support the training
   requirements identified in the TTL and define the objectives used to evaluate the student’s
   attainment of training goals. Academic CROs may be included in the syllabus as a separate
   chapter or attachment, within the study guides, or in separately maintained documents.
   Performance CROs may be included in the syllabus, briefing guides, or in separately
   maintained documents. When CROs are not contained in the syllabus, identify their location
   in attachment 2 of the syllabus.
4.2. Office of Primary Responsibility. The syllabus OTD team is normally the OPR for
syllabus-related documents (other than the TTL). OTD teams may delegate development and/or
maintenance responsibility of specified documents to other units, as needed. In these cases, the
office of primary development responsibility will be identified on the introduction page of the
syllabus-related document. A list of all syllabus-related documents will be included as
attachment 2 of the syllabus. See format in Attachment 8, paragraph A8.14.
4.3. Format. Design and organize syllabus-related documents in a format consistent with the
purpose/type of the document and the applicable course of instruction, ensuring document
consistency within the training program.
   4.3.1. Number syllabus-related documents using a numbering system consistent with the
   type and intended use of documents produced, and maintain an index of current documents
   and changes. If a specialized numbering system is not required, use the type, title or subject,
   plus the number of the course the document supports as the identifying number.

   4.3.2. ACC syllabus-related documents used at multiple formal training locations should not
   include local material, other than as examples. In these cases, local units may supplement the
   syllabus-related documents with OTD team approval.
4.4. Administrative Procedures. Although syllabus-related documents are not designed as
specialized publications, they are administered in much the same way. The OTD team is
responsible for development of documents deemed necessary. The OTD team is responsible for
coordinating documents with all principal users.
   4.4.1. Development and Approval. Training task lists will be developed and approved as
   stated in Chapter 2. Other syllabus-related documents will be created by or under the
   direction of the applicable OTD team and will be approved by the OTD team (T-3).
   Syllabus-related documents do not require HQ ACC staff approval.
   4.4.2. Availability. Unless otherwise directed, include the ACC syllabus OPR and
   HQ ACC/SEF in the distribution listing for all training/phase manuals. Ensure all syllabus-
   related documents are available for review by all who received the original syllabus.
   4.4.3. Reproduction and Distribution. The FTU is responsible for printing, reproduction
   and distribution of syllabus-related documents, except for TTLs.
   4.4.4. Review. Review TTLs IAW Chapter 2. The OTD team reviews all other syllabus-
   related documents every 2 years at a minimum, or sooner if course critiques, weapons system
   changes or other data necessitate an earlier review. Document reviews and keep on file until
   the next review. FTUs will coordinate on and review changes to syllabus-related documents.
   (T-3)
   4.4.5. Verifying Currency. Users are responsible to verify they are using the most current
   copy of all syllabus-related documents. Users may verify the currency of their syllabus-
   related documents by contacting the applicable OTD team.
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                       17


4.5. Foreign Military Sales Training. All documents, classified and unclassified, developed or
revised for courses providing foreign military sales training must receive foreign disclosure
authorization from HQ ACC/IAG before final approval and release. HQ ACC/IAS uses
approved ACC syllabi to develop formal tuition rates for international students attending ACC
courses IAW DoD FMR 7000.14R, Volume 15.
4.6. Classified Documents Procedures. Classification, marking, storage, transmission, receipt
and accountability procedures of AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, are
applicable to publications and documents developed, reproduced and issued under the authority
of this instruction. Classified publications and documents issued for student use are
organizational property. Students requiring such material upon course completion will request
the appropriate school forward it to their assigned unit. Request for any classified or unclassified
retainable instructional materials from foreign nationals must comply with AFI 16-201, Air
Force Foreign Disclosure and Technology Transfer Program; and AFI 16-105, Joint Security

Notes:
1. The OTD team submits a sanitized copy of the TTL (i.e., no tracked changes, comments or
watermark) and evidence of OG/CC coordination to HQ ACC TRSS/TDF.
2. The TDF action officer (AO) reviews TTL to ensure ACCI 36-2252 compliance. If any
documentation is missing or if corrections are required, the TTL is sent back to the OTD team.
3. TDF sends the draft TTL to the appropriate HQ ACC functional area manager (FAM) and
other external staff offices (based on weapons system) for review and coordination with a
14-calendar day suspense. Concurrent with the FAM reviews, TDF conducts an in-depth review
for completeness, accuracy, grammar and TTL coding.
4. AO sends all corrections, questions and comments to the OTD team. The OTD team resolves
issues, enters approved edits to TTL, and returns it to TDF. Once all issues are resolved, the AO
conducts a final review, assembles final TTL package (hard-copy) and forwards the package to
TDF/OPS.
5. TDF/OPS conducts a final review and submits the hard-copy and electronic approval package
to TRSS/CD.
6. TRSS/CD reviews and sends the electronic SSS package to TRSS/CC.
7. TRSS/CC considers the eSSS package.
8. Upon TRSS/CC approval, TRSS sends the release message.
9. TDF sends the official TTL to the OTD team and posts the TTL on the ACC TRSS Training
Development SharePoint. The OTD team distributes the approved TTL IAW the TTL
distribution list and their local procedures.

                            TRAINING TASK LIST FORMAT

A4.1. General. This attachment describes the required content and format requirements for
training task lists. Use Times New Roman font, 11-point font size, except as noted below.
Format the TTL title as weapons system, crew position, “Training Task List”. The TTL
identifier should identify the weapons system and crew position using abbreviations. Examples
are available on the ACC TRSS Training Development SharePoint.
A4.2. Cover Page Format. The cover page identifies the document as an ACC TTL.
   A4.2.1. Indicate the TTL title, and display the ACC shield, draft annotation, anticipated TTL
   approval month and year (45 days from submission), and “AIR COMBAT COMMAND”
   using uppercase format. The font size and general appearance should be standardized for all
   TTLs for the weapons system.
   A4.2.2. Releasability Statement. Place the following releasability statement at the bottom of
   the page in 11-point font size using full justification format:
       A4.2.2.1. “Releasability: Access to this document is restricted. Distribution is
       authorized to Department of Defense and U.S. DoD contractors for administrative or
       operational use. Refer other requests to [insert OPDR name and abbreviated address].”
   A4.2.3. Leave the reverse of the cover page blank. After approval, HQ ACC TRSS/TDF
   will remove the draft annotation and validate the approval month and year.
A4.3. Introduction Page Format. The introduction page establishes the authenticity of the
publication and reflects the various offices of responsibility.
   A4.3.1. Header. Place the ACC organizational heading, “ACC TRAINING TASK LIST”
   and the TTL identifier in the header. The identifier will be in uppercase.
   A4.3.2. Title and Date. Center the title and anticipated approval date in bold uppercase
   format separated by a blank line or equivalent.
   A4.3.3. Introduction Paragraph. The introduction label will be in uppercase followed by a
   double line space. The introduction paragraph will be verbatim with the insertion of the
   applicable weapons system and crew position, as applicable. This paragraph will use
   justified format.
       A4.3.3.1. “This document prescribes the tasks requiring formal training for operation
       and employment of the [insert weapons system] weapons system and applies to all units

   A4.3.5. Supersession Data. Place the supersession information near the bottom of the page.
   Place a solid 2-inch line followed by the supersession data, if applicable. Identify the TTL
   OPR, OPDR and office of collateral responsibility (OCR), if applicable, with their
   abbreviated addresses and 5-digit zip code.
A4.4. Summary of Revisions Format. Title the summary of revisions in uppercase format,
bolded and centered. Number it as page 2 of the TTL. Summarize all major changes made to

ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                        27


   A4.7.3. Use. This paragraph defines how the TTL should be used in developing training and
   evaluation programs for training. No scripting adjustment is necessary for this paragraph,
   except for determining the applicable AFH 36-2235 volume number and title.
      A4.7.3.1. “1. 3. Use. Management at all levels should use this listing as one of the
      source references when developing training and evaluation programs and documents.
      Units developing training for the tasks identified in this document will develop detailed
      objectives IAW AFH 36-2235, (insert the applicable volume number and title), for each
      task trained. All objectives for a given duty area must, as a minimum, support the tasks
      listed in this document. Detail all objectives developed to accomplish this TTL in the
      appropriate course control documents.”
   A4.7.4. Training Task List Matrix. This paragraph describes the format of the training
   task list matrix to include task identification, tasks, training phases and devices used.
      A4.7.4.1. The training phases should use the MDS Volume 1 nomenclature for the
      formal training phases. The matrix will not include on-the-job training, proficiency
      training (commonly referred to as continuation training), or unit-specific training
      programs. Post-graduate formal certifications (e.g., Flight Lead upgrade, NVG
      certification) should be listed in a separate column(s) or may be combined into one
      column if the tasks are clearly differentiated.
      A4.7.4.2. Each training phase will have only one column documenting the final training
      proficiency. Course control documents will determine how the training is developed to
      support the TTL training requirements (i.e., academic, device or flying).
Table A4.1. Training Task List Matrix Format.
1.4. Training Task List Matrix. The TTL matrix consists of a series of columns.
1.4.1. The first column contains the Task Number to establish a hierarchal order of training
elements.
1.4.2. The second column lists the duties, tasks, subtasks and activities organized in a logical,
hierarchal order. Tasks are derived from (insert sources of tasks).
1.4.3. The next (insert number) columns identify the various training phases.
1.4.3.1. ENTRY. This column reflects the assumed or documented proficiency levels for
students entering (insert the next column label). The skills are based on published course
prerequisites and may have been acquired from formal training or job experience.
1.4.3.2. (Enter labels for each formal training phase). This column lists the training
proficiencies prescribed by (enter label for the respective formal training phase).
1.4.3.3. (Enter label[s] for formal post-MQT upgrade training, if applicable). This column
lists the training proficiencies for advanced formal training programs leading to qualification
or certifications as prescribed in (insert AFI 11-2(MDS) Volume 1 or other local training
program).
1.4.4. The last (insert number, if applicable) column(s) identifies the various task elements
trained in the (insert training devices).

   A4.7.5. Knowledge/Performance Standards. This paragraph defines how training tasks
   are analyzed using the descriptive proficiency standards in table 1.1 of the TTL. Insert the
   applicable source of the grading standards reference to the training standards for grading
   criteria. The second sub-paragraph is optional. If it is not used, the first paragraph should be
   rolled up into the major paragraph.
Table A4.2. Knowledge/Performance Standards.
1.5. Knowledge/Performance Standards.
1.5.1. Use the standards in table 1.1 to document the training proficiency required for the task
elements in the various formal training phases, and not for evaluating individual crew
members. Use grading standards in (insert the grading standards reference and publication
title) for grading crew member performance according to the proficiency standards identified
in the respective syllabus or training program. After completing training, the crew member
maintains task proficiency through continued job experience.
1.5.2. When the (insert column labels [i.e., IQT and MQT]) columns both have entries
indicating the same training proficiency level, this means that there is a separate training
requirement in each training phase, but there is no change in the training proficiency standard.
This generally applies to tasks, subtasks or activities where there are differences in specific
procedures or policies that cannot be taught in (insert column label [i.e., IQT]).

   A4.7.6. Evaluating Training Devices. This paragraph indicates how the TTL is used to
   evaluate training devices. If there are no training devices used to support the TTL, list the
   paragraph title and “Not Applicable.” Otherwise, use the scripted formats below, as
   applicable.
      A4.7.6.1. If the TTL identifies training devices that are covered under the SIMCERT
      program, use the following paragraph.
Table A4.3. Evaluating Training Devices. (SIMCERT)
1.6. Evaluating Training Devices. The 29th Training Systems Squadron (29 TSS) uses the
task list to evaluate aircrew training devices IAW AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force
Training Systems, and MAJCOM-approved Master Simulator Certification (SIMCERT) plan.
An “X” in the (specify applicable column[s]) indicates the task elements that the 29 TSS will
evaluate training support during SIMCERT.”

      A4.7.6.2. If the TTL identifies training devices or training aids that are not covered
      under the SIMCERT program, use the following paragraph.
Table A4.4. Evaluating Training Devices. (Non-SIMCERT)
1.6. Evaluating Training Devices. The (state responsible unit) uses the task list to evaluate
training aids IAW ACCI 36-2250, ACC Operations Training Development Program. An “X”
in the (specify applicable column[s]) indicates the task elements that the (state responsible
unit) will evaluate training support for periodic syllabus reviews.

   A4.7.7. TTL Changes. This paragraph identifies the OTD team responsible for making
   changes to the TTL. Use the following paragraph.
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                       29


       A4.7.7.1. “1. 7. Changes. Submit proposed changes affecting the content of this
       document to (insert OTD Team and abbreviated address).”
   A4.7.8. Table 1 1. Knowledge/Performance Standards. This table shows the knowledge
   and performance standards used in ACC TTLs. Insert this mandatory table so that it does not
   split across a page. It can be placed anywhere after it is first introduced in the Knowledge/
   Performance paragraph. The table should be verbatim unless the OTD team obtains approval
   from ACC TRSS/TDF for additional unique explanations.
A4.8. Training Task List. The TTL table is the meat of the document. Insert the TTL title in
title case, centered on the page and bolded. Present the duties, tasks, subtasks and activities
using the table format described in paragraph A4.8.1. List elements in some logical order, such
as chronological (i.e., mission sequence), hierarchal (i.e., simple to complex) or by subject, topic
or system.
   A4.8.1. TTL Structure. Identify duties, tasks, subtasks and activities separately by a
   numbering sequence. All tasks, subtasks and activities make up a specific duty. All specific
   duties form the overall task requirement for an aircrew or mission crew position.
Table A4.5. TTL Structure.
 The task listing is divided into categories relevant to major duties on the weapons system.
 Duties Examples
 01.              Mission Planning                                                         [Duty]

30                                                             ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014


03.01.01.02.    Review syllabus objectives/requirements                                  [Activity]
  A4.8.2. TTL Title Elements. For TTL elements that are fully supported by sub-elements,
  there should be no coding; it is considered a title line. Title lines should not use verbs unless
  the verb will pull down to all child subtasks as indicated by a colon at the end of the task
  statement. There should be no instances where there is a title line with a single coded
  subtask; delete the title line and elevate the subtask to the same level as the deleted title line.
  There should be no instances where there is a coded parent task with coded child subtask(s);
  either change the parent task to a title line with no coding, or elevate the subtasks to the same
  level as the parent task.
  A4.8.3. Verbs.
      A4.8.3.1. TTL elements requiring task performance must include an action verb to
      clarify the performance expectation. TTL elements requiring only subject knowledge do
      not have a verb. For task knowledge elements, verb use is optional.
      A4.8.3.2. Avoid code mismatches that occur by mixing a performance verb and listing
      subject knowledge coding, or not having a verb and including a performance code. A
      verb-code mismatch does not apply to the entry column where, for example, the TTL
      element requires a task performance standard, but on entry, the student only has general
      subject knowledge.
      A4.8.3.3. The verb must clearly articulate the task requirement. The verb “demonstrate”
      should be reserved for instructor demonstration task elements (i.e., demonstrate boom
      limits). Avoid non-descript verbs such as “ensure.”
  A4.8.4. TTL Knowledge/Performance Coding. Use the codes from table 1.1 to code TTL
  elements for each entry and formal training phase column in the TTL matrix.
      A4.8.4.1. Entry Skill Coding. The entry column should reflect the skill set at course
      entry. Generally these should be subject knowledge or task knowledge coding. There are
      probably few tasks that an entry task performance level is expected on entry. For
      elements where no entry skills are assumed, enter a dash in the entry column.
      A4.8.4.2. Training Phase Skill Coding.
         A4.8.4.2.1. Enter the skill coding that defines the training proficiencies for each
         syllabus or training program column for each TTL element (other than title elements).
         Coding must reflect the training program requirements; not a perceived expectation.
         Task Performance Level codes of “4”, Task Knowledge Level codes of “d” and
         Subject Knowledge Level codes of “D” are not appropriate for initial skills training
         courses including IQT, MQT or initial instructor upgrade courses. Course developers
         must be able to trace each coded task to specific academic, device or flying objectives
         or tasks within the respective syllabus or training program.
         A4.8.4.2.2. Task element coding defines the minimum knowledge/performance skill
         set at course graduation or training program completion. Crews are expected to
         maintain proficiency in skill sets previously trained. Skills maintenance and on-the-
         job training is not documented in the TTL. Subsequent training programs that rely on
         a previously trained TTL element will insert a dash in the matrix for that TTL
         element and training program. However, if unique aspects of the task are included in
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                     31


           the subsequent training program, then the appropriate coding should be inserted for
           the TTL element in the subsequent training program.
           A4.8.4.2.3. Develop unique instructor duties and tasks to capture the instructor skills
           taught and performed within the instructor upgrade course. Do not code general tasks
           previously taught in IQT or MQT when no additional training is provided within the
           instructor course. Such general tasks should be coded with a dash.
A4.9. Attachment 1—Glossary of References and Supporting Information. This attachment
identifies the references, abbreviations and acronyms and terms used within the TTL. Include all
references cited in the TTL in alpha-numerical order. Define all abbreviations and acronyms in
alphabetical order. (Exception: Acronyms in the Common Acronym List on the ACC TRSS
Training Development SharePoint do not need to be listed.) List terms in alphabetical order and
explain as necessary. Use Attachment 1 as an example.
A4.10. Attachment 2—Syllabus/Training Programs Inventory. This attachment lists all
syllabi and training programs that support the TTL. For each of these, identify the syllabus or
training program OPR, OPDR and OCR, as applicable, and include the abbreviated address.

   in uppercase and centered format and place a page label on the next line using right justified
   format. Include the Introduction, Summary of Revisions, Distribution, chapter, sections and
   the x.x main paragraphs, Attachments and attachment numbers, Figures and figure numbers,
   and Tables and table numbers. Insert a blank line before the Chapter, Attachments, Figures
   and Tables headings. Additional white spacing between lines up to a maximum of 3-points is
   permissible. Section entries may be italicized if they are italicized within the syllabus. Place
   the page reference on the right margin preceded by a dot leader for each item. Note:
   Chapter, Attachments, Figures and Tables labels do not require page references. Sections
   require page references only if there is no major paragraph listed within the section.
   Mandatory chapter, sections or major paragraphs that are not applicable should be annotated
   as “Not Applicable” or “N/A” within parentheses and do not require a page reference. Do
   not include a reference to the table of contents within the table of contents. Sections,
   paragraphs, attachment numbers and table numbers may be indented, but the indenting
   convention must be standardized for the weapons system.
   A8.5.2. Verify all titles and page references in the table of contents match the respective
   titles and page in the syllabus. Do not include acronyms that are defined in a main paragraph
   or table title unless the acronym is used elsewhere within the table of contents.
A8.6. Distribution Page Format. The distribution page defines the automatic distribution
requirements. The format is the same for either a syllabus or TTL. See Attachment 6 for a list of
mandatory distribution offices. See the format requirements in Attachment 7.
A8.7. Chapter 1 Format. This section describes how Chapter 1, Course Accounting, should be
formatted. See chapter labeling format at paragraph A11.2.6.
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                   39

  format.
     A8.7.1.1. Course Title/Number/Supported Training Task List. List the course title
     and course number as shown on the cover page. Identify which TTL(s) this course
     supports. If a TTL has not been developed, the OPDR is responsible for developing a
     TTL, and should state “TTL is in development.” For Weapons Instructor Courses, state
     “This course does not support a TTL.”
     A8.7.1.2. Course Entry Prerequisites. State all course-specific entry requirements as
     coordinated with the OPR. Just referencing the Air Force ETCA is not acceptable.
     Break out prerequisites by track and/or crew position, if applicable.
     A8.7.1.3. Course Purpose and Graduate Status. State the general course/track
     structure, goals, AFSC awarded, and relationship of training received to weapons system
     upgrade requirements (e.g., mission qualification, mission ready).
     A8.7.1.4. Active Duty Service Commitment. State the ADSC incurred and reference
     the applicable table and rule from AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments
     (ADSC). If the course incurs no ADSC, state “Not Applicable.”
     A8.7.1.5. Location. State the implementing unit (usually the Operations Group, or
     equivalent), base, state abbreviation and 5-digit zip code. If other locations are
     specifically authorized, list them separately. If other locations could be authorized,
     indicate the approving agency.
     A8.7.1.6. Duration. List the total number of training days as shown in the management
     flow chart, with a breakdown of ground training days, flying training days and other
     days. See Attachment 1 for ground, flying and other training day definitions. For

     training time limitations, if applicable.
     A8.7.1.7. Number of Training Hours. This paragraph consists of the heading with an
     accompanying table (preferred) or subparagraphs to summarize the course hours. List the
     type of training according to the chapter 3-5 titles, (e.g., academic training, device
     training, flying training) and total hours. Hours may be stated in hours and minutes or in
     hours and tenths format. Academic training is broken out as course academic hours
     (includes course-related ancillary training), and any non-course related ancillary training
     hours or advanced distributed learning (ADL) hours, as applicable. Device training
     includes the number of device sessions and device hours, and the briefing and debriefing
     hours. Flying training includes the number of sorties and aircraft flying hours, and
     mission planning, briefing and debriefing hours. For non-flying syllabi, the format would
     be similar except substitute part-task, full-mission or operator mission headings, as
     applicable.
  A8.7.2. Section 1B Contents. Section 1B is titled Academic Training Inventory.
     A8.7.2.1. The use of a main paragraph in this section is optional.
40                                                           ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014


     A8.7.2.2. The Academic Training inventory identifies all course-related academics,
     which may be a listing of each academic event or may be summarized by blocks or
     subject area. If summarized by block or subject area, the corresponding academic
     training descriptions in chapter 3 must be laid out in a block or subject format. The
     inventory must identify whether the event is instructor-led or self-paced training.
     Ancillary training that is directly related to the course will be included in the course-
     related academics listing (i.e., Marshalling Training, Cockpit/Crew Resource
     Management, Instrument Refresher Course, etc.). These lessons will also be included in
     the academic lesson descriptions. If other non-course related ancillary training is
     included, list or summarize the additional ancillary training separately. For courses using
     ADL lessons, list or summarize ADL training events in the academic training inventory.
  A8.7.3. Section 1C Contents. Section 1C is titled Device Training Inventory or Part-Task
  Training Inventory.
     A8.7.3.1. The use of a main paragraph in this section is optional.
     A8.7.3.2. The Device (or Part-Task) Training Inventory lists each event listed in chapter
     4 of the syllabus. List the event identifier, the device/part-task hours, and direct support
     (if applicable), and any support hours for briefing and debriefing. Subtotal by
     device/part-task type, if applicable. Provide a grand total of sessions, device/part-task
     hours and support hours.
  A8.7.4. Section 1D Contents. Section 1D is titled Flying Training Inventory, Full-Mission
  Training Inventory, or Operator Mission Training Inventory.
     A8.7.4.1. The use of a main paragraph in this section is optional.
     A8.7.4.2. The Flying (or Full-Mission or Operator Mission) Training Inventory lists each
     student sortie or mission listed in chapter 5 of the syllabus.
         A8.7.4.2.1. List the sortie/mission identifier, aircraft or mission hours and support
         hours for mission planning, briefing, debriefing, etc.; any direct unit support sorties
         and hours; and other support requirements (e.g., tanker support), as applicable.
         Subtotal sorties/missions and hours by flight phase or module, if applicable, and
         provide grand totals.
         A8.7.4.2.2. Direct support sorties are aircraft sorties generated by the FTU
         Operations Group to support student training. Compute direct support and other
         support requirements based on per aircrew basis. Fractional data are permissible.
         Other support sorties include other assets required to complete the mission (e.g.,
         tankers and adversary aircraft). These other support sorties generally come from off-
         station.
         A8.7.4.2.3. For flying syllabus programming and cost accounting, obtain the refly
         rate from the syllabus OPR and compute the student sortie requirement (SSR) for the
         course or tracks, as applicable. Express the SSR as a decimal value. MDSs with
         multiple crew positions may calculate refly rates by individual crew position. Units
         may average refly rates, as required, if determined to be the most accurate method for
         establishing overall FTU sortie requirements. See Attachment 1 for SSR definition
         and computation formula.
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                     41

      A8.7.5.1. The use of a paragraph in this section is not mandatory.
      A8.7.5.2. The Weapons Inventory lists the weapons and range requirements for each
      applicable sortie. Usually record the data on a per crew basis. If using another basis,
      clearly state the basis; for example, individual or class. Include weapons requirements
      for direct support sorties. Sub-total requirements by flight phase or module, if applicable,
      and provide grand totals. Note that a grand total is not applicable for non-expendable
      munitions.
A8.8. Chapter 2 Format. This section describes how Chapter 2, Course Management, should
be formatted.
   A8.8.1. Section 2A Contents. Section 2A is titled Course Training Standards and includes
   the mandatory paragraphs described below.
      A8.8.1.1. Academic Training Standards. Identify academic course training standards
      as defined in ACCI 36-2250 or other source, as applicable.
      A8.8.1.2. Performance Grading Criteria. Define the performance grading criteria. All
      flying syllabi will use the grading criteria in ACCI 11-464. Non-flying syllabi may use
      grading criteria from their governing directives, if applicable, or they may define unique
      grading criteria. In this context, “word-smithing” the contents of the grading criteria
      specified in ACCI 11-464 does not constitute unique grading criteria and is not permitted.
      A8.8.1.3. Performance Training Standards. Identify course performance standards,
      usually as required proficiency levels (RPL). The RPL elements will usually relate to the
      grade sheet or to training tasks. Multi-tracked syllabi may require separate tables to
      present the RPLs for the various tracks. End-of-block or end-of-course RPLs may apply
      to sortie-driven or event driven training systems (see ACCI 11-464). Sortie specific
      RPLs may be identified for sortie-driven training systems. The RPLs will be included in
      this section or referenced from here to another location in the syllabus, such as chapter 4
      or chapter 5, or as a separate attachment.
   A8.8.2. Section 2B Contents. Section 2B is titled General Instructions and includes
   paragraph titles and content as follows. Alter sample statements only as necessary to clearly
   define authority or requirements.
      A8.8.2.1. Approval Authority. This statement is mandatory for all ACC formal
      operations training syllabi. When another Major Command (MAJCOM)/A3 must be
      coordinated prior to ACC/A3 approval, modify the statement to include the consultation
      annotation.
          A8.8.2.1.1. “HQ ACC/A3 (in coordination with [insert MAJCOM/A3]) is the
          approval authority for this syllabus.”
      A8.8.2.2. Waiver Authority. This is a mandatory paragraph. If waiver authority is
      delegated, specifically state the conditions of delegation using the example statements
      below for overall syllabus, entry prerequisites, and training events and completion, as
      applicable. If waiver authority is not delegated, state: “Waiver Authority. ACC/A3 is
      the waiver authority for this syllabus. Staff waiver requests through (insert appropriate
      action office, usually the syllabus OPR).”
42                                                         ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014


        A8.8.2.2.1. Use this statement if HQ ACC/A3 grants overall syllabus waiver
        authority: “Waiver Authority. HQ ACC/A3 delegates waiver authority to (insert A3-
        delegated waiver authority office). Staff waiver requests through (insert appropriate
        action office, usually the syllabus OPR).”
        A8.8.2.2.2. Use this statement if HQ ACC/A3 grants prerequisite waiver authority:
        “Course Entry Prerequisite Waiver Authority. HQ ACC/A3 delegates waiver
        authority for course entry prerequisites to (insert A3-delegated waiver authority
        office). Staff waiver requests through (insert appropriate action office, usually the
        syllabus OPR).”
        A8.8.2.2.3. Use this statement if HQ ACC/A3 grants training completion or
        graduation deferment authority to the FTU operations group commander or
        equivalent.
            A8.8.2.2.3.1. “Training Completion/Events and Graduation. The syllabus waiver
            authority may waive graduation requirements. The (insert OG/CC or equivalent)
            may defer unaccomplished tasks to the gaining unit. The (insert OG or
            equivalent), if not the gaining unit OG, will coordinate with the gaining unit OG
            or equivalent on all training deferments. The graduate will be unqualified in
            deferred events until completed by the gaining unit. Send a copy of all
            deferments to (insert syllabus OPR) within 10 working days of approval.”
     A8.8.2.3. Graduation Requirements. Modify this mandatory paragraph only as
     needed: “Graduation Requirements. Graduation from this course requires the effective
     completion of all training prescribed by this syllabus [unless waived or deferred IAW
     paragraph (insert reference to waiver and/or deferment paragraphs, as applicable)].”
     A8.8.2.4. Commander’s Authority. Modify this mandatory paragraph only as needed.
     The particular MDS Volume 1 may provide more specific guidance.
        A8.8.2.4.1. “Commander’s Authority. The (insert operations group commander or
        equivalent) is responsible for conducting the training specified under the authority
        and direction of this syllabus. The FTU OG/CC may substitute equivalent training
        that complies with the direction and intent of this syllabus. The (insert applicable OG
        or squadron commander) may authorize deviations in the order of training to meet
        special weather and peculiar local conditions. Deviations will be consistent with
        good training management, student progress and student experience level. However,
        all prerequisite training must be accomplished before associated device or flying
        training. Document all deviations and substitutions in the affected student’s grade
        book.”
     A8.8.2.5. Training Records Maintenance. In addition to the mandatory reference to
     the Air Force Records Distribution Schedule, identify any other directive that governs
     training records.
  A8.8.3. Section 2C Contents. Section 2C is titled Special Instructions and includes the
  following paragraphs, as applicable.
     A8.8.3.1. Training Strategy. Describe the training strategy.

     duties, documentation procedures, forms used).
     A8.8.3.3. Alternate Missions. This paragraph is required for all flying syllabi except
     presidential support and surveillance and reconnaissance syllabi. State any limitations on
     alternate missions. For example, “Alternate mission profiles are limited to maneuvers,
     mission events and/or mission profiles that have been flown on a previous syllabus
     training sortie.”
     A8.8.3.4. Source Documents. This paragraph is required for all flying syllabi except
     Weapons Instructor Courses. Flying syllabi will only use formally approved sources for
     training airborne maneuvers (i.e., AFTTP 3-1 series, AFTTP 3-3 series, etc.). Include the
     following statement in all flying syllabi: “USAF Weapons School texts, papers, or draft
     3-series publications will not be used as source documents for developing or describing
     airborne maneuvers, teaching techniques or teaching tactics until approved by ACC for
     incorporation in syllabi or supporting phase manuals.”
     A8.8.3.5. Syllabus Mission Leadership. Clarify responsibility for mission leadership.
     For a flight crew member example, “Students will not brief or lead syllabus missions.
     This restriction does not prohibit a student from briefing or leading specific portions of
     the mission (e.g., low level, range, air-to-air refueling). When the syllabus requires an
     instructor pilot chase or the student to fly lead position for a specified period, the student
     does not become a designated flight lead. The IP of record retains lead of the flight and
     overall responsibility for the conduct of the mission.” Alter the example as required for
     mission crew leadership delineation. Note: Applies to initial qualification and transition
     courses. Not applicable for Weapons Instructor Courses and unmanned aerial systems
     syllabi.
     A8.8.3.6. Safety. For non-flying syllabi, tailor the following required statement or
     provide safety guidelines, as appropriate. For flying syllabi, follow this example:
        A8.8.3.6.1. “Safety. The flying and academic challenges of this syllabus require a
        dedicated, daily risk management (RM) focus as outlined in AFI 90-802, ACC
        Supplement, Risk Management. Nothing in this syllabus requires compromising
        safety. Make a RM assessment on each sortie/mission. Instilling the foundations of
        RM for safe, smart decision making is crucial to developing discipline, skill and
        proficiency at the individual level.         Plan, brief, execute and debrief each
        sortie/mission with emphasis on risks, restrictions, the environment and
        aircraft/systems capabilities and limitations to develop sound combat habit patterns.
        Sound combat habit patterns are inherently safe. All those assigned to support this
        syllabus are responsible for executing it safely.”
     A8.8.3.7. CRM Training. Define CRM training requirements. Weapons system
     specific CRM is required in all flying syllabi. Instructor CRM is required for all
     instructor upgrade syllabi. See AFI 11-290, ACC Supplement, Cockpit/Crew Resource
     Management Training Program.
     A8.8.3.8. Unique Syllabus Features. Explain any unique syllabus features.
     A8.8.3.9. Extended Period of Non-Flying. This paragraph is required for all flying
     syllabi. Tailor this statement as needed: “If a student has not flown or has had no
44                                                          ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014


     simulator training for more than 14 calendar days, the (insert OG/CC [or “FTU
     commander” if authority delegated by OG/CC] or equivalent) may authorize additional
     training sorties or simulator training sessions before the student resumes formal training.
     The number and type of additional sorties or sessions is determined on an individual
     basis.” Expound on limits to additional training events and describe procedures for
     implementation and documentation.
     A8.8.3.10. Proficiency Advancement. If authorized, state the conditions for
     proficiency advancement. For example, “(insert FTU OG/CC [or FTU/CC if authority
     delegated by OG/CC] or equivalent) of units conducting formal operations training are
     authorized to proficiency advance a student in any syllabus module or phase when the
     student demonstrates performance to syllabus standards. Proficiency advancement will
     not be used as a management tool to graduate students by a specific date.” Note:
     Reductions in total syllabus flying sorties and early graduation are authorized for initial
     qualification, transition, requalification and instructor courses and difference training
     courses. Once a sortie, mission or simulator session is proficiency advanced, it cannot be
     added back to the students training program without using student non-progression
     procedures.
     A8.8.3.11. Substandard Performance. Explain substandard performance policies (see
     ACCI 11-464).
     A8.8.3.12. Extra (X) Sortie Policies and Limits. Explain “X” sortie policies and limits
     (see ACCI 11-464).
     A8.8.3.13. Progress Checks. Explain progress check policies (see ACCI 11-464).
     A8.8.3.14. Corrective Action Options. Define corrective action options (see ACCI 11-
     464).
     A8.8.3.15. Elimination Procedures. Explain elimination procedures (see AFI 11-402,
     Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Aviation Badges).
  A8.8.4. Section 2D Contents. Section 2D is titled Course Flow and includes the course
  map and management flow chart.
     A8.8.4.1. Course Map. A course map is required for all flying syllabi. The course map
     should show branching alternatives to allow personnel who manage courses flexibility in
     implementing the syllabus. Some branching alternatives may not provide optimized
     training, but conditions during implementation may require using these alternative paths.
        A8.8.4.1.1. Use a symbol legend to define symbols used in the course map. Note:
        The symbols used in a particular syllabus should be standardized for all syllabi for the
        weapons system.
        A8.8.4.1.2. The course map identifies the prerequisite relationship between the
        individual training elements. The course map should have a general flow (top to
        bottom or vice versa). Clearly identify the course map entry point. The prerequisite
        path is shown by solid lines with arrows. Dashed lines and arrows can be used to
        show desired training placement.
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                    45


      A8.8.4.2. Management Flow Chart.
          A8.8.4.2.1. A management flow chart is required for all syllabi.
          A8.8.4.2.2. The management flow chart depicts the optimum path through the course
          map to accomplish all training requirements using the available resources. When a
          training event takes multiple days for all students to complete, show the event over
          multiple days in the management flow chart. Exception: Some weapons systems do
          not have dedicated training assets, which results in extensive delays for required
          sorties or alerts. The MDS Volume 1 states the maximum time allowed to complete
          the required training. In this case, the management flow chart should be generated on
          a per student basis without regard to resource constraints.
          A8.8.4.2.3. The management flow chart is the basis for determining the course
          duration listed in chapter 1 of the syllabus. Include any travel days if students are
          required to relocate to different training locations as “other” training days. Do not
          include attrition days in the management flow chart.
      A8.8.4.3. Combined Course Map and Management Flow Chart. The course map
      depiction may be designed to combine the elements of the course map and management
      flow chart. The enhanced course map will depict the optimum training path organized in
      a day by day format. It must show the daily events with lines showing any prerequisite
      relationships and must account for resource constraints.

                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FORMAT

A9.1. Executive Summary. This attachment describes the format of an executive summary that
accompanies a draft ACC formal operations training syllabus for ACC TRSS staff coordination
and HQ ACC/A3 approval. The executive summary must include the seven mandatory
paragraphs labeled Course Purpose and Graduate Status, Location, Duration, Number of
Training Hours, Justification for Revision (or Justification for Course Development), Waiver
Delegation and Cost Impact. The executive summary should address who, what, where, when
and why questions.
   A9.1.1. Course Purpose and Graduate Status, Location and Duration. These paragraphs
   in the executive summary generally mirror the corresponding paragraphs in chapter 1 in the
   syllabus. Slight variations for grammatical style are permitted.
   A9.1.2. Number of Training Hours. This information is presented in table format and
   mirrors the data displayed in the corresponding table or paragraphs in the syllabus. The table
   in the executive summary will also include delta column(s) to show the difference from the
   previously approved syllabus. Exception: New syllabi do not require delta column(s).
   A9.1.3. Justification for Revision (or Justification for Course Development). This
   paragraph supports the rationale for course revision or development. It needs to be in
   sufficient detail to convey relevant information, yet concise for general officer review. It
   needs to address the rationale for development or revision and state who or what precipitated
   the change. Provide specific justification to answer the “who, what, where, when and why”
   questions for the syllabus revision or course development.
       A9.1.3.1. Explain why the syllabus is being revised or developed. State whether this is
       the normal biennial revision, or if this is an out-of-cycle revision. Identify any major
       system or equipment modifications impacting the course revision.
       A9.1.3.2. Identify how many students the course trains each year, possibly identifying
       the class size and number of classes per year. Alternatively, this information could be
       placed in either the Course Purpose and Graduate Status or the Duration paragraph.
       A9.1.3.3. If implementation will be delayed, state the intended implementation time or
       class.
       A9.1.3.4. Summarize the extent of the revision or development effort and explain the
       reason for the changes. Classify the impact of the development or revision effort
       according to academic, device (or part-task) and flying (or full-mission or operator
       mission) training. Much of this information will come from the summary of revisions
       section of the syllabus, but may need to be condensed and summarized for general officer
       review. Do not include administrative minutia. Substantive comments are required when
       course content changes more than 10%.
   A9.1.4. Waiver Authority.
       A9.1.4.1. If there is no waiver delegation state “ACC/A3 retains all waiver authority.
       Staff waiver requests through (insert appropriate action office).”
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                  49


     A9.1.4.2. For waiver delegation requests that comply with paragraph 3.3.2.2.2, state
     “Request A3 delegate [insert syllabus or course entry prerequisite] waiver authority to
     [insert A3 division or branch, as appropriate], who has functional responsibility for this
     weapons system.”
     A9.1.4.3. For waiver delegation requests that do not comply with paragraph 3.3.2.2.2,
     state “Request A3 delegate [insert syllabus or course entry prerequisite] waiver authority
     to [insert proposed designee]” and provide compelling justification for non-standard
     waiver authority delegation.
  A9.1.5. Cost Impact. Summarize the overall cost for the identified syllabus changes or new
  development. Explain all factors affecting costs, both increases and decreases, (such as
  course duration, academic hours, device hours, flying hours [student and direct support]) to
  the new or revised syllabus. Indicate if the changes will cause any revisions to a contract
  aircrew training/courseware development or similar contract, if applicable. For new
  expenses, clearly state how it is funded. Identify any funding shortfalls and program impact.
  The OPDR may require assistance from the local wing, group and/or the syllabus OPR to
  quantify the cost impact.

                             SYLLABUS CHANGE FORMAT

A10.1. General. Syllabus change procedures are generally for minor out-of-cycle changes.
However, in-cycle syllabus revisions with only minor changes (less than 20%) could use these
syllabus change procedures. The maximum number of changes for a syllabus is two. If a third
change is needed, the syllabus will be revised to incorporate all changes.
   A10.1.1. The OTD team will seek ACC weapons system functional area manager (FAM)
   guidance before preparing and coordinating syllabus change documents (see paragraph
   3.9.3).
   A10.1.2. Cover Page. Immediately below the original approval date, insert “Change [insert
   change number] Incorporated, [insert anticipated approval month and year]” and on the next
   line “DRAFT – Not For Implementation.” ACC TRSS/TDF will remove the draft annotation
   and validate the actual month and year after approval.
   A10.1.3. Change Page Format. The change page is placed between the cover page and the
   introduction page.
       A10.1.3.1. Header. Insert the ACC organizational header with the change number,
       syllabus identifier and “TBD [Month Year]” placeholder. HQ ACC TRSS/TDF will
       update the actual change date after approval.
       A10.1.3.2. Title Lines. Center the type of training, course title and change number
       using bold uppercase format.
       A10.1.3.3. Summary of Changes. Use sufficient detail to define the scope and
       justification for the change. Include this as the last sentence “A margin bar indicates
       changed material.”
       A10.1.3.4. Signature Blocks. Insert the current COMACC and ACC/A3 signature
       blocks using spacing as for normal syllabi. Insert “DRAFT - Not For Implementation”
       above the ACC/A3 signature when submitting the change. ACC TRSS/TDF will remove
       the draft annotation after approval.
       A10.1.3.5. Additional Information. If the OPR, OPDR or OCR changes, update the
       information. Never use a supersession line for syllabus changes.
   A10.1.4. After the change page, submit the entire syllabus.
       A10.1.4.1. The original introduction page will retain the original syllabus date and
       signature blocks. Annotated “DRAFT - Not For Implementation” above the A3 signature
       block on the introduction page and in the footer of all pages.
       A10.1.4.2. Do not include changes within the original summary of revisions.
       A10.1.4.3. Use change bars to identify changed material. The change bar may be on the
       outside margins or on the left margin as desired, but consistent throughout the document.
       When using landscape presentation, the change bar should be on the margin as viewed in
       the landscape presentation. Within the header on pages with changes, replace the original
       syllabus date with the change number and the abbreviated change month and year (i.e.,
       CCALLMCIU, Change 1, Aug 13).
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                  51


  A10.1.5. Inserted material could adversely affect paragraph numbering and page references
  within the syllabus. To minimize the impact, non-standard paragraph labeling is permitted
  such as adding a paragraph suffixes (i.e., 2.6a for an added paragraph between 2.6 and 2.7).
  Similarly inserting multiple pages using non-standard page labeling is also permitted such as
  labeling inserted pages with a suffix (e.g., pages 34A and 34B inserted between pages 34 and
  35).
 52                                                           ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014

               GENERAL WRITING AND FORMATTING GUIDELINES

A11.1. Writing Guidelines. Comply with the following general writing guidelines when
developing all ACC formal operations training publications.
   A11.1.1. Acronyms.
      A11.1.1.1. Do not define acronyms in the summary of revisions or table of contents
      unless the acronym is subsequently used in that section. Any such acronym must be
      redefined when used in the body of the document.
      A11.1.1.2. Spell out all acronyms when first used in the body of the document and as
      necessary throughout the document to remind reader of the meaning when the acronym is
      used sparsely. The ACC TRSS Training Development SharePoint has a list of commonly
      accepted abbreviations or acronyms that do not need to be spelled out or included in
      attachment 1.
      A11.1.1.3. Acronyms that are commonly understood within the weapons systems
      community need not be spelled out within the TTL matrix or within syllabus event
      descriptions but must be defined in attachment 1.
      A11.1.1.4. Do not capitalize words within the context of a sentence just to define the
      acronym.
   A11.1.2. Capitalization. Reference AFH 33-337, The Tongue and Quill, for capitalization
   rules.
      A11.1.2.1. Do not capitalize “if,” “and,” “or” or “of” even if they appear in titles.
      A11.1.2.2. Write out chapter, table, figure and paragraph references completely in
      lowercase; do not abbreviate (e.g., chapter 1, figure 1). Capitalize only if adding the title
      (e.g., “Chapter 1, Course Accounting” and “see chapter 1”).
      A11.1.2.3. Do not capitalize references to positions when they refer to an individual or
      organization in general terms (e.g., “the operations group commander,” “the chief of
      safety,” “the wing,” “the command” or “the numbered air force”).
      A11.1.2.4. Capitalize references to positions when they refer to a particular individual or
      organization (e.g., “1st Operations Group Commander,” “1 FW Chief of Safety,” “1 st
      Fighter Wing,” “Air Combat Command,” “15th Air Force,” “93d Air Control Wing” and
      “93 ACW”).
   A11.1.3. Punctuation Guidelines.
      A11.1.3.1. Commas. Follow the guidelines in AFH 33-337 for proper use of commas.
      Use commas to separate instruction number from volume, supplement or change numbers
      (e.g., AFI XX-XXXX, Volume 1, ACC Supplement). Also, use commas to separate the
      title of a publication from its reference.
      A11.1.3.2. Spaces after Punctuation. Insert two spaces between sentences except for
      justified text, which requires a single space to avoid excessive proportional spacing.
ACCI36-2252 20 AUGUST 2014                                                                      53


      Always insert two spaces after colons unless used as a ratio or a unit of time. Always use
      one space after semi-colons.
   A11.1.4. Word Use Guidelines.
      A11.1.4.1. Do not orphan organizational labels or instruction or from references that
      split onto two separate lines (e.g., 55 OG/CC, ACCI 36-2250, AF Form 847).
      A11.1.4.2. Spell out numbers less than 10 unless used to designate a unit of measure or
      time.
      A11.1.4.3. Ampersand. Do not use the ampersand symbol (&) in sentences.
      Ampersand use within titles, tables or figures is acceptable.
   A11.1.5. Slash. Restructure sentences to avoid using a slash since its use can be confusing.
   If used, do not insert spaces before or after the slash unless the combined words are in
   uppercase.
   A11.1.6. Proofreading. To improve quality, one or two individuals without technical
   expertise in the particular weapons system or syllabus topic should review the document. At
   least one OPDR/OCR level, word-for-word review is required in order to catch errors that
   may be overlooked due to familiarity with the weapons system/syllabus topic.
      A11.1.6.1. Use spell check. However, just using spell check is no substitute for a quality
      word-for-word review.
      A11.1.6.2. Verify that signature blocks are current and correct.
      A11.1.6.3. If the document supersedes another, verify the supersession information at the
      bottom of the introduction page.
      A11.1.6.4. Verify that chapter, section, paragraph, attachment, figures and table titles
      and page references are correct in the table of contents.
      A11.1.6.5. Verify that totals of columns and/or rows of numbers in all tables add up
      correctly.
      A11.1.6.6. Verify that references to lesson numbers, titles and academic hours
      correspond throughout the document and within tables and figures (i.e., numbers listed in
      academic inventory correspond with numbers listed on management flow chart and in
      lesson descriptions).
      A11.1.6.7. Writing style and format should be consistent throughout the entire document
      and should follow grammatical guidelines in AFH 33-337.
      A11.1.6.8. When grammatical guidelines are not defined or there is more than one
      correct method, be consistent throughout the document.

  A11.2.3. Page Headers. The header of the introduction page will have the organizational
  style header. Subsequent page headers will include the document identifier, month and year,
  with the page number on the outside margin (odd page number on the right; even page
  number on the left). Align the header vertically with the page margins.
  A11.2.4. Page Numbering. Number all pages after the introduction page using an Arabic
  number within the header. The basis for page numbering is the introduction page.
  A11.2.5. Line Spacing. Comply with line spacing requirements for the introduction page,
  table of contents, and the chapter and attachment titling. Other paragraphs and section labels
  should be single-spaced with a blank line between paragraphs (preferred), but paragraph
  spacing of not less than 6 points after is acceptable as long as it is consistent throughout the
  document. Paragraphs should not use the before line spacing settings in the body of the
  document. Line spacing before and after figures and tables should match the line spacing
  convention for other paragraphs.
  A11.2.6. Chapter and Attachment Labels. The chapter and attachment labels will be in
  title case, bolded and centered on the top line of a new page. (Exception: Multiple chapters
  that are not applicable may be on the same page.) All chapter and attachment titles will be in
  uppercase, bolded and centered, and do not end with a period. The chapter and attachment
  titles will be placed after one blank line below the chapter or attachment label and will have a
  blank line after the title.
  A11.2.7. Labels. The section number and title is separated by an Em-dash, and is in bolded
  normal or italics format. Section labels do not end with a period.
  A11.2.8. Main Paragraphs. Bold all main paragraph headings. The main paragraph
  numbers may also be bolded. Standardize the paragraph format throughout the document.
  Main paragraph labels end with a period.
  A11.2.9. Non-Applicable Mandatory Chapters and . Mandatory chapters, sections or
  paragraphs that do not apply should be referenced in the document and in the table of
  contents. Within the document, insert the mandatory title followed by “(Not applicable).” In
  the table of contents, insert the mandatory title followed by either “Not Applicable” or “N/A”
  within parentheses.
  A11.2.10. Tables. Label all tables with a table number and title. The table number will
  include the chapter number and table sequence number and table title. They will be left-
  justified, bolded, title case, and will end with a period. Place the table title above the table.
  Table width should be no wider than the line width. Use title case and bold the table header
  and total line, if applicable. When the table spans multiple pages, the table label applicable
  header lines must appear on the subsequent page. Standardize table format, border styles and
  shading.
  A11.2.11. Figures. Label all figures with a figure number and title. The figure number will
  include the chapter number and figure sequence number and figure title. They will be left-
  justified, bolded, title case, and will end with a period. Figure titles may be placed above or
  below the figure, but must be consistent throughout the document. When the figure spans
  multiple pages, the figure label must appear on the subsequent page.

  including a publication title after its reference, show the title in italics. Bold or italic type
  may be used sparingly for emphasis. Bold “Note” or “Exception” when used to identify key
  points; however, do not bold entire sentences, paragraphs, pages, tables or figures.
