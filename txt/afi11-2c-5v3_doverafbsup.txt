3.16.4. Follow these procedures when Additional Crew Members (ACMs) require seats in the
troop compartment on home station departure:
3.16.4.1. (Added) The CP notifies the Air Terminal Operations Center (ATOC) of the number of
seats required in the troop compartment. Passenger Service space blocks seats for the exclusive
use by ACMs.
3.16.4.2. (Added) All ACMs will be seated prior to passenger boarding. Crewmembers will
ensure ACMs comply with the same flight directives as passengers (i.e. in-flight advisory signs,
use of electronic devices).
4.2.1.1. (Added) ACs must apply sound judgment while conducting off-station training. In
some cases, the aircraft should be recovered to a more suitable repair-capable base prior to
completing scheduled training versus landing at a facility where the required maintenance is not
available. When in doubt, contact the appropriate OGV on-call for clarification.
4.3.1. Local Flight Waiver Requests. All waiver requests will be processed through Dover CP.
4.3.1.1. (Added) Off-Station Training Missions. Respective OG/CC is the waiver authority for
off-station training missions under their operational control.
4.4. Contact on-call OGV personnel through the Dover CP or the 512 Operations Center, as
appropriate. When beyond C2 capability, the AC retains ultimate authority and responsibility; in
these cases, contact OGV as soon practical after the flight. Dover crews should request technical
support and additional assistance from home unit or the appropriate A3 or A4 agency. Work
Higher Headquarters assistance requests through 618 Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) to
the maximum extent possible.
4.4.1. (Added) Under non-emergency situations, the AC should call back to Dover and
coordinate with 436 or 512 OGV on-call personnel, as appropriate, before accomplishing any of
the following:
4.4.1.1. (Added) Non-Standard configuration takeoff, i.e. flaps less than 40%, slats retracted,
slats extended with flaps retracted.
4.4.1.2. (Added) Planned gear-down flights; capped brakes.
4.4.1.3. (Added) Deactivated flight controls.
4.4.1.4. (Added) Flights involving Aircraft Battle Damage Repair (ABDR) procedures.
4.4.1.5. (Added) Any malfunction causing a drag index.
4.10.4. Prior to departing without vibration monitoring capability, the AC or FE should contact
Dover Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) at Defense Switch Network (DSN) 677-5436 to
review the aircraft history. Ask the dispatcher to run all 55XXX and 23XXX work unit codes.
The dispatcher will review the aircraft history to determine if there is a history of engine
vibration. If a recent history exists, the AC should reevaluate the discrepancy and identify it as
Mission Essential (ME).
4.10.5. (Added) Signal Acquisition Remote (SAR) 03. According to the Minimum Equipment
List (MEL), SAR 03 is not required for en route departures. However, this SAR is necessary for
engine vibration monitoring. For en route departures (column B), follow the guidance for engine
vibration monitoring inoperative.

4.10.6. (Added) FEs should conduct a quick engine vibration analysis on the first suitable leg of
each mission. A simple check of each vibration channel will provide the crew with a general feel
for engine performance as well as the fidelity of the vibration system.
5.2.2. (Added) Duty Passenger Monitoring in the AOR. When passengers are located in the
troop compartment, a crewmember shall also be positioned there to monitor them. If there are
insufficient crewmembers to man the troop compartment and all observer stations, the AC will
determine which observer station will go unmanned.
5.2.3. (Added DOVER) Crewmembers will not use audio devices, personal computers or
gaming devices while performing primary crew duties at their duty station.
Exception: Aft Flight Deck LMs may use this equipment once cleared off of interphone by the
AC unless performing passenger monitoring duties.
5.12.5.1.1. (Added) Don headset during cargo compartment transit in-flight. Plugging into the
scanner's cord is not required.
5.12.5.1.2. (Added) Personnel flying in Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) status, including
flying crew chiefs, require an escort when working in or transiting the cargo compartment.
5.12.5.1.3. (Added) During night operations, crewmembers escorting passengers through the
cargo compartment in-flight will have an operable flashlight in their possession.
5.16.1. All aircrews should use a block out crew (TA) if available. ACs will exercise increased
vigilance during block out if a block out crew is not available. Ensure all crewmembers are
briefed accordingly. Do not taxi into or out of a Dover parking spot without at least one
marshaller. Do not taxi into or out of a Dover parking spot unless all personnel and equipment
are outside of the white lines. Do not deviate from the yellow taxi lines. Use window scanners
to help ensure obstacle clearance.
5.16.1.1. (Added) Do not taxi through Dover parking spots without prior coordination with the
Dover CP and Dover Ground Control to ensure the spot is clear of all obstacles.
5.16.1.2. (Added) C-5 parking on the transient ramp requires approval of the 436 OG/CC, the
436 AMXS/CC, and the Airfield Manager. Adjacent spots C-1, 2, and 3 must be empty to
provide adequate wing tip clearance.
5.16.1.3. (Added) A taxi problem exists involving Boeing 747 aircraft on Delta row (in front of
Base Operations). If a 747 is being loaded through the nose, a C-5 taxiing on the taxi line does
not have adequate wing tip clearance when a K-loader is mated to the front of a 747. The C-5
must delay taxi until the K-loader is moved. In all cases, if wing tip clearance is questionable,
deplane a scanner and verify wing tip clearance. A solid white line has been painted in front of
Delta parking spot. Wing tip clearance of 25 feet is provided when vehicles and equipment are
parked between the white line and Delta parking spots. Wing tip clearance of 25 feet is not
provided for vehicles and equipment parked between the white line and the taxi line.
5.16.1.4. (Added) Damage has been caused to aircraft parked on spot E when a C-5 made the
right turn onto taxiway A. When maintenance is occurring or maintenance stands are present in
the area around spot E, the pilot of the taxiing C-5 will stop the aircraft and coordinate with
Ground Control or CP to have personnel secure themselves and their equipment prior to
resuming taxi and making the right turn onto taxiway A.
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                        7


5.16.2. Use the rope measuring procedures in the AMC Taxi Training Guide if unsure of
obstacle clearance.
5.16.2.1. (Added) When conducting 180 degree turns with conditions that differ from those
depicted in Section 2 of T.O. 1C-5A-1, Flight Manual, 1 July 2007 (i.e. wet runway, aft CG,
etc.), ACs should make every effort to turn on a surface wider than 150 feet.
5.20. For information on Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH), see DAFB Instruction (DAFBI)
91-212, Dover AFB Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard Program, 26 January 2007.
5.20.1. Dover Bird Watch Condition (BWC). DAFB Tower is responsible for determining the
BWC. Most AMC bases determine a BWC for the entire airfield. DAFB is unique and
determines a BWC for each runway.
5.20.1.1. BWC Low. Birds present a minimal hazard. No restrictions to flying operations.
Exception: During BASH Phase II peak bird hours, transition training requires OG/CC (or
higher) approval.
5.20.1.2. BWC Moderate. Birds present an increased hazard to flying operations. Restrictions:
Initial takeoffs and full stop landings only. AMC transition training ceases to affected runway.
If both runways are moderate, crews must either hold until Air Traffic Control (ATC) changes
the BWC back to Low or coordinate with Dover CP to depart to an alternate training airfield. At
Dover, it is possible for one runway to be Moderate or Severe, while the other runway is Low.
Transition training is only allowed on a BWC Low runway.
5.20.1.3. BWC Severe. Birds present an extreme hazard to flying operations. Restrictions:
Takeoffs and landings are prohibited without OG/CC (or higher) approval for both local sorties
and AMC missions.
5.20.5. If a bird strike is suspected, notify ATC and Dover CP, land as soon as practical, and
have a maintenance inspection performed. Enter all suspected or confirmed bird strikes in the
aircraft forms.
5.20.5.1. (Added) Report all bird strikes to the C2 agency and file an AF Form 853, Air Force
Wildlife Strike Report, regardless of damage.
5.20.5.2. (Added) Collect remains from all bird strikes. Turn in remains to local Wing Safety,
Airfield Operations, or Maintenance Quality Assurance (QA).
5.20.6. (Added) Phases of bird activity.
5.20.6.1. (Added) Phase I.     Migratory bird activity is low, normally between April and
September.
5.20.6.2. (Added) Phase II. Migratory bird activity is high; normally between October and
March.
5.20.6.2.1. (Added) Phase II Operations.
5.20.6.2.1.1. (Added) Phase II Peak Bird Hours. Based on observation data at Dover, flying
hours are restricted from 1/2 hour before sunrise and sunset to 1 1/2 hours after sunrise and
sunset. Local transition training is extended from 2200L to 2300L. Unless otherwise published,
assume peak bird hours at other AMC bases to be 1 hour before sunrise and sunset to 1 hour after
 8                                        AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011


sunrise and sunset. If you have questions concerning peak bird activity or hours, contact the
specific base Airfield Operations or Wing Safety Office for an immediate update.
5.20.6.2.1.2. (Added) Home station departures and local training missions will be scheduled
outside peak bird hours to the maximum extent possible. Tactical and Visual Flight Rules (VFR)
training operations during Phase II are limited to 250 Knots Calibrated Airspeed (KCAS) or
lower and a minimum of 1000 feet (FT) above ground level (AGL) (day) and 3000FT AGL
(night) while conducting VFR training. Crews operating in the Dover terminal area may fly at
1000FT AGL day or night.
5.20.6.2.1.3. (Added) Night circling approaches in the northeast quadrant (area between
runways 19 and 32) and the TACAN RWY 19 approach will be restricted to an Minimum
Descent Altitude (MDA) of 900FT Mean Sea Level (MSL) and a required ceiling of 1500FT
AGL or greater during Phase II until departing from the MDA.
5.20.6.2.1.3.1. (Added) Standard ceiling minimums apply during day operations, and when
circling in any other quadrant during Phase II.
5.20.6.2.1.4. (Added) Flying during peak bird hours is restricted to one approach to a full stop or
one takeoff and departure. Training sorties flying transition at any base during peak bird hours
(at that base) require 436 OG/CC’s approval. Current Operations will make every effort to avoid
scheduling transition training during peak bird hours. Terminate transition training before peak
bird hours unless a waiver is granted by the 436 OG/CC.
5.20.6.2.1.5. (Added) Training missions, to include AR locals, which must depart during peak
bird hours to complete the mission, will be approved by OG/CC on a case-by-case basis.
5.20.7. (Added) Use the following procedures for all departures (Phase I and II):
5.20.7.1. (Added) If able, check the bird activity around the airfield using the Avian Hazard
Advisory System (AHAS) website (http://www.usahas.com).
5.20.7.2. (Added) Scan the runway and takeoff area for birds before takeoff.
5.20.7.3. (Added) At Dover, contact Airfield Management Operations or Tower/Ground Control
to remove birds sighted near the runway.
5.20.7.4. (Added) Delay takeoff when birds conflict with takeoff or departure flight path.
5.21. Dover crews are not qualified or authorized to perform FCFs.
5.30.3. The AMC AMP Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) shall be followed by all C-5
aircrew. These procedures mainly apply to pilots but are provided to all crew positions for
reference.
5.32. (Added) Rejected Takeoff or Full Stop Taxi Back Guidance.
5.32.1. (Added) Prior to takeoff after a rejected takeoff or a full stop taxi back, a wheel and
brake inspection is required.
5.32.1.1. (Added) Use the Quick Stop checklist to deplane the scanner and, if available, an extra
crewmember. The extra crewmember will maintain interphone contact throughout the scanner’s
inspection.
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                        9


5.32.1.2. (Added) A wheel and brake inspection will be conducted. However, it is not necessary
to touch each tire unless a hot brake is suspected. It is necessary to enter the wheel wells.
Scanners will use extreme caution and spend minimum time in the wheel wells. If it becomes
necessary to remain in the vicinity of the gear to further investigate a problem, chocks must be
installed.
5.33. (Added) Landing Gear Malfunctions and Troubleshooting Procedures.
5.33.1. (Added) When in the Dover area, troubleshoot landing gear malfunctions over the
Delaware Bay, preferably while in the published holding pattern at TIDEY.
5.33.2. (Added) Unless safety of flight or fuel dictates otherwise, perform all landing gear
extensions over the bay following a malfunction where mechanical damage is suspected.
5.34. (Added) Failed Skid Detector (DET FAILED).
5.34.1. (Added) Regardless of the cause, a DET FAILED light must be evaluated and acted
upon. The crew’s reaction is situational, but there are some basic guidelines. This guidance
applies equally to steady and flickering lights. The following information is provided to help
crews reach the best course of action possible.
5.34.2. (Added) Abort Considerations.
5.34.2.1. (Added) Low Speed Aborts. At low speed, under non-emergency conditions, the crew
should consider an abort. What constitutes low speed? It’s situational; a short icy runway
presents an entirely different situation than a 13,123FT dry runway. The abort speed is
dependent on critical runway factors. Consider the computed Critical Field Length (CFL) vs.
Radar Altitude (RA) and the Refusal Speed (VR) versus Go Speed (VGO). Excess RA coupled
with a high VR produces a higher acceptable abort speed.
5.34.2.2. (Added) High Speed Aborts. High-speed aborts, above 80 KCAS are usually not a
good idea; keep in mind, a free-wheeling pair of brakes invalidates the computed refusal speed.
Again, abort speeds are situational.
5.34.2.3. (Added) Precautionary Measures. There are four basic DET FAILED scenarios; take
off continued, takeoff aborted, touch-and-go landings, and full-stop landings. Each scenario
carries slightly different precautions.
5.34.2.3.1. (Added) Takeoff Continued. Consider leaving the gear extended (climb-out
performance dependent). Release the scanner to complete a wheel and brake in-flight inspection
IAW [NO LABEL MAPPING for "Paragraph"! 12.16.2.1 (Basic Instruction). Complete the
―Anti-Skid System Detector Failed Light On‖ procedure in Section III. Consider a runway
Foreign Object Damage (FOD) check; coordinate a fly-by if gear damage is suspected. For
landing, follow the Takeoff Aborted precautions.
5.34.2.3.2. (Added) Takeoff Aborted. Conditions permitting stop the airplane using light
braking; be prepared for asymmetric braking. Turn off the runway, keep taxi distance to an
absolute minimum, stop and inspect for damage. Inspect brakes IAW procedures in [NO
LABEL MAPPING for "Chapter"! 12 (Basic Instruction).
5.34.2.3.3. (Added) Full-stop Landings. Follow the ―Anti-Skid System Detector Failed Light
On‖ procedure in Section III. Consider the Takeoff Aborted precautions.
 10                                       AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011


5.34.2.3.4. (Added) Touch-and-Go-Landings. An abort is NOT recommended; a touch-and-go
is a flying maneuver. Follow the Takeoff Continued precautions. The next landing shall be a
full stop. For landing, follow the Takeoff Aborted precautions.
5.35. (Added) Guidance on Un-Commanded Thrust Reverser Lights.
5.35.1. (Added) In an effort to clarify some key points, apply the following headquarters (HQ)
AMC/A3V coordinated guidance in addition to information found in the TO 1C-5A-1-4, Flight
Manual Supplemental, 1 July 2007.
5.35.1.1. (Added) Prior to GO speed.
5.35.1.2. (Added) Thrust Reverser Extend and/or Not Locked Light: Reject.
5.35.1.3. (Added) Thrust Reverser Pressure Light: Treat like Anti-Skid DET FAIL light (i.e. do
not reject at high gross weights and/or airspeeds).
5.35.2. (Added) In-flight.
5.35.2.1. (Added) Extend and Not Locked Light: If the Thrust Reverser is not extended, it is an
obvious indication malfunction and no further action is required in-flight.
5.36. (Added) Slat Decouple/Re-Couple Procedures.
5.36.1. (Added) In addition to the procedures in TO 1C-5A-1, crews will adhere to the
following:
5.36.1.1. (Added) If the applicable section III procedure does not correct the problem, the FE
will troubleshoot the flap/slat malfunctions using the MADAR.
5.36.1.2. (Added) Ensure the Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781A, Maintenance
Discrepancy and Work Document, entry includes the correct fault code and associated verbiage.
The write-up should also include all pertinent aircraft information, i.e., bank angle, climb,
descent, turbulence; and operator input, i.e., missing the detent, moving the flap handle in small
increments, or reversing the flap handle.
5.36.1.3. (Added) Before landing, aircrews should coordinate with CP to obtain a suitable
parking spot; ensure the controller understands that engines will be shut-down for maintenance.
The spot must allow maintenance stand access to the full wing area.
5.36.1.4. (Added) If the slats have decoupled, re-coupling shall not be attempted with engines
running. All decouples require some form of maintenance action. The maintenance action
(inspection) required is driven by the nature of the malfunction; i.e., retraction verses extension;
slats appear fully extended/retracted, brake light on/off, etc. In all cases, maintenance personnel
must use appropriate technical data to troubleshoot, correct, and clear the Form 781A
discrepancy.
5.36.2. (Added) If the decouple was operator induced, maintenance personnel may re-couple the
slats and ops check the system; no additional maintenance action is required. The rationale is
simple; the cause of the decouple is known and a malfunction is not present.
5.36.3. (Added) If the decouple was caused by a malfunction, maintenance action is required to
determine the cause.
5.36.4. (Added) If at a non-repair capable location:
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                          11


5.36.4.1. (Added) Due to a lack of equipment, a complete inspection may not be possible. In
such cases, maintenance personnel and crews will exercise judgment. The aircraft crew chief
shall contact A4 or a C-5 Aero Repair (AR) shop for proper inspection requirements if unaware
of what to inspect.
5.36.4.2. (Added) If a full inspection is not possible, it may be necessary to leave the inspection
open, re-couple the slats and continue to a location where a full inspection can be accomplished.
Depending on the situation, it may be prudent to fly with the slats retracted or call for a
Maintenance Repair Team (MRT). Do not hesitate to contact the OGV on-call FE.
5.36.5. (Added) Flap Malfunctions in the Dover Local Pattern.
5.36.5.1. (Added) This guidance does not apply to Off-Station trainers and Operational
Missions. If the flaps fail to reach the commanded position, consider the following:
5.36.5.1.1. (Added) Complete a thorough scan IAW the Flight Manual. If necessary, complete
the remainder of the Section III procedure to include MADAR troubleshooting, if conditions
permit.
5.36.5.1.2. (Added) To aid maintenance in correcting the malfunction, the AC may elect to
accomplish a full stop landing with the flaps and slats at the ―set‖ position. This is the AC’s
decision. If the AC determines it is safe and prudent to conduct a full-stop landing with less than
full flaps, conduct a partial flap landing IAW the Flight Manual.
5.36.6. (Added) Do not consider landing without completing all applicable Section III
procedures under the following conditions:
5.36.6.1. (Added) If the Gross Weight (GW) is greater than 525,000 and flaps are less than 40
percent.
5.36.6.2. (Added) When corrected landing distance is a factor.
5.36.6.3. (Added) When Tire Limit Speed is a factor.
5.36.7. (Added) Make a complete Form 781A entry. Include all pertinent aircraft information,
i.e., bank angle, climb, descent, turbulence; and operator input, i.e., commanded
position/direction of movement, reversing the flap handle, etc. Do not forget to include that the
reset procedures were not completed to help facilitate maintenance.
5.36.8. (Added) AR shop personnel will conduct a complete inspection of the flap drive system.
Troubleshooting flap drive malfunctions with the flaps left in the ―set‖ position greatly enhances
the ability to correct malfunctions. It is particularly helpful for repeat discrepancies.
5.36.9. (Added) Bottom line, when in doubt, contact the 436 or 512 OGV on-call FE.
5.37. (Added) Space Cargo Mod (SCM) Aircraft Operation.
5.37.1. (Added) The following applies when operating C-5C aircraft, tail numbers 80213 and
80216:
5.37.1.1. (Added) Crew Qualification. C-5 qualified pilots and engineers are qualified on the C-
5C. Loadmasters (LM) must be certified on SCM aft door operation before they are qualified to
operate them. This training involves witnessing/performing an actual opening/closing of the aft
doors under the supervision of a SCM aft door-qualified LM. When operating with light cargo
 12                                        AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011


loads or an aft Center of Gravity (CG), tankering extra fuel may be necessary to maintain the
airplane within CG limits.
5.37.1.2. (Added) Door Operation Restrictions. When the C-5C aircraft is used for line
missions, LMs will utilize the forward door system to the maximum extent possible. Use of the
aft door system will be limited to outsized cargo and requires a C-5C door-qualified LM. These
restrictions also apply to duty LMs.
5.37.1.3. (Added) Un-press Door Open Procedures. According to Lockheed, if the aft door
comes open in flight, it may be lost at any speed. If the aft cargo doors cause an ―Un-press Door
Open,‖ indication accomplish the following:
5.37.1.3.1. (Added) Operational Missions and Off-Station Training.
5.37.1.3.1.1. (Added) If the light illuminates and stays illuminated: Land as soon as possible
(ASAP).
5.37.1.3.1.2. (Added) If the light illuminates and is intermittent: Land as soon as practical.
5.37.1.3.2. (Added) Training Missions.
5.37.1.3.2.1. (Added) Local Transition. If the ―Un-press Door Open‖ light comes on (steady or
intermittent), land and do not continue until maintenance action has been performed.
5.37.1.3.2.2. (Added) Air Refueling. If the ―Un-press Door Open‖ light comes on (steady or
intermittent), do not attempt further contacts, land as soon as practical.
5.38. (Added) Aircrew Procedures for Lightning within 5nm Conditions.
5.38.1. (Added) The following procedures will be adhered to by all aircrew members when a
lightning within 5 miles condition is announced:
5.38.1.1. (Added) If aircraft engines are running, all crewmembers will remain on the aircraft to
include the scanner, who will not deplane for engine shutdown.
5.38.1.2. (Added) If the aircraft is not currently in an approved parking spot, the crew may
continue to parking but will hold just prior to the assigned spot. The crew will not enter the spot
until after the lightning hold is lifted and wing walkers are in place.
5.38.2. (Added) If aircraft engines are not running, all external preflight and loading operations
will immediately cease. All crewmembers outside the aircraft will either vacate the flight line to
a building or seek cover inside the aircraft. Once the lightning hold is lifted, the crew may
resume normal operations.
5.39. (Added) Crews Transporting Human Remains From Overseas to Dover AFB.
5.39.1. (Added) DAFB is the primary arrival point for receiving fallen comrades coming into the
United States (US) from overseas. We have a dignified transfer process in place to honor our
fellow Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines who are en route to their final resting place. This
should not be confused with an arrival ceremony (news crews, dignitaries, etc.). Your crew and
passengers are part of the process and should know your requirements and what to expect when
you arrive at Dover.
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                            13


5.39.2. (Added) Before departure to Dover, ACs will call the Dover CP at DSN 677-4211 and
pass all known information to include delays, Computer Flight Plan (CFP) flight time, and
concerns.
5.39.3. (Added) Because of the amount of coordination required, crews will adhere to the
mission cut. If arrival time differs by more than 15 minutes notify Dover CP by any means
available.
5.39.4. (Added) C-5 Procedures.
5.39.4.1. (Added) LMs will make every attempt to load human remains on the cargo floor, side
by side, in the forward portion of the airplane. Human remains will be loaded with the head
forward. The preferred method of offload is, forward kneel, drive-in.
5.39.4.2. (Added) LMs will ensure that baggage/equipment (i.e. oil, purchased items, chocks,
etc.) are aft of the transfer cases. This will allow the honor guard full access to the cases and
remove tripping hazards.
5.39.4.3. (Added) If transfer cases must be loaded in the aft portion of the airplane, crews will
notify Dover CP of the case location in the above mentioned before departure coordination call.
5.39.4.4. (Added) Once the human remains are loaded, and the doors are closed, the LMs will be
responsible for ensuring the flags are removed, folded, and placed in a location to prevent soiling
or damage, if required. Once the flags have been removed and folded the transfer cases will be
tied down IAW Airlift Procedures/Restrictions Guide and the TO 1C-5A-9, Loading Instructions
Manual, 16 August 1984. Upon landing at Dover, and prior to opening the doors, replace the
flags on the transfer cases (if removed) and ensure they are secured so they do not undrape
during the ceremony.
5.39.5. (Added) Expect the following actions upon arrival. This process can take from thirty
minutes to more than an hour, dependent on the number of transfer cases on board.
5.39.5.1. (Added) Deplane personnel required to secure your aircraft (scanner, engineer, etc.).
5.39.5.2. (Added) Customs/Agriculture Inspectors will meet and clear the aircraft.
5.39.5.3. (Added) Once cleared, representatives, to include the Port Mortuary and the DAFB
Honor Guard will board the aircraft and prepare the transfer cases for offload. The crew should
remain in place. If directed by DAFB representatives, passengers should be downloaded prior to
the dignified transfer.
5.39.5.4. (Added) Once transfer cases are prepared for offload, open the cargo door(s).
5.39.5.5. (Added) The Honor Guard will board the aircraft and assume their position around the
transfer cases.
5.39.5.6. (Added) When directed, the crew will form up on the aircraft as directed, allowing
room for the Honor Guard to maneuver. All commands will come from the senior DAFB
representative on board.
5.39.5.7. (Added) A DAFB Colonel or Chaplain, and probably an officer representing the
branch of service of the deceased, will board the aircraft and the Chaplain will say a prayer.
5.39.5.8. (Added) The officials rendering honors will exit the aircraft and take up position off
the nose/tail of the aircraft.
 14                                        AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011


5.39.5.9. (Added) The Honor Guard will then proceed with the dignified transfer of the human
remains to waiting vehicles.
5.39.5.10. (Added) The Honor Guard will follow the last vehicle off the flight line and other
wing personnel will leave the aircraft.
5.39.5.11. (Added) Passengers and baggage will be downloaded (if not already accomplished).
5.39.6. (Added) Remember it is important to arrive on schedule or keep Dover CP updated on
changes to arrival time. There is always a chance that a senior service representative may be
coming in from off-station to meet your aircraft and it is important to arrive as close to your
scheduled arrival time as possible.
5.39.7. (Added) If you have any questions or comments, please address them to the senior
officer who initially boards your aircraft.
6.2.10. (Added) IAW Paragraph 2.6 of DAFBI 21-105, Foreign Object Damage Prevention
Program, 8 March 2007, aircrew and load crew members must account for all equipment and
personal items to include any government issued items after each loading/flight and ensure any
items lost are annotated in the aircraft Form 781A.
6.2.10.1. (Added) Aircrew members will identify personal (issue) equipment (i.e., headsets,
flashlights, all-purpose tools, etc.) with a minimum of first initial, last name, squadron. This
does not include personal issue clothing. In addition, all issued tool kits (i.e. Flight Engineer tool
kits) must be marked with a squadron unique symbol/number.
6.5.1. (Added) Review the Special Pilot in Command Airports and Airport Qualification
Program (AQP) as defined in the Airfield Suitability and Restrictions Report (ASRR),
paragraphs 15 & 16.
6.6. Crews departing home station on missions will receive an Intel (IN) brief prior to departure.
The briefing should be received prior to entering crew rest.
6.6.1. (Added) In case of emergency and after duty hours, an OSS/IN briefer is on-call with a 30
minutes response time. The phone number is kept at CP.
6.7. (Added) Tactics Briefing for Home Station Departure. Crews departing home station on
missions will receive a tactics brief prior to departure when required. The briefing should be
received prior to entering crew rest.
6.7.1. (Added) In case of emergency and after duty hours, an on-call tactician can be reached
through CP.
6.7.2. (Added) Tactics binders are available from the Tactics Office for missions that are
expected to transit the CENTCOM Area of Responsibility (AOR) and will be checked out by all
436/512 AW crews. The binders are available for pickup at Base Operations in the Crew
Communications (COMM) office during duty hours or at the operations desk after duty hours.
6.7.3. (Added) En route Procedures. The tactics binder contains classified material and needs to
be stored IAW with standard classified security procedures.
6.7.4. (Added) Returning Procedures. Binders will be returned to Base Operations in the Crew
COMM office during duty hours or at the operations desk after duty hours.
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                         15


6.8.1. All crewmembers shall review Part B, Current Read File, prior to every aircraft ground
trainer, simulator, local, or home-station departure. Sign-off the review in the Flight Crew
Information File (FCIF) management module of Patriot Excalibur (PEX). If unable to log into
PEX, initialing a copy of the crew orders will be acceptable for mission or flight. For simulator
or ground trainer, fill out a spare copy of the AMC Form 396, FCIF Currency Record, in the
FCIF binder and initial in the Part B section only when a new item has been added since the last
PEX sign-off.
6.8.4. (Added) C-5 pilots/flight engineers will be required to accomplish a boldface and
operations limits test and C-5 LMs will accomplish a boldface test prior to the end of each month
(Applicable to 436 OG). AFRC (512 OG) unit crewmembers will accomplish a boldface test
prior to their first flight of each month.
6.8.4.1. All crewmembers will submit their tests to squadron OGV for grading. Administration
of the tests, as well as crewmember status after unsatisfactory performance is at squadron (SQ)
CC discretion.
6.8.4.2. After completing the test for the month, crewmembers will annotate completion by
signing-off the monthly ―Boldface Test‖ in the FCIF module of PEX. Crewmembers failing to
complete the test by the end of the month will not perform aircrew flight or ground duties until a
test is completed and annotated in PEX.
6.9. All crewmembers shall review the FCB at the beginning of each quarter. Sign-off the
review in the FCIF module of PEX.
6.10.5. (Added) Portable Flight Planning Software (PFPS)/e-Publications Viewing Device.
6.10.5.1. (Added) Laptops will be transferred and accounted for by using AF Form 1297,
Temporary Issue Receipt. The 1297s will contain at least the following information: Individual
item descriptions, tracking numbers, and serial numbers where applicable. Preformatted 1297s
are available.
6.10.5.2. (Added) Upon arrival at en route stations, the case and its equipment should be
appropriately secured.
6.10.5.3. (Added) The configuration of the laptops shall not be changed. No programs will be
added to or deleted from the original configuration.
6.16.2.4.1.2. (Added) SDP Guidance. If the filed departure and SDP do not follow the same
ground path, comply with the following:
6.16.2.4.1.2.1. (Added) If an engine failure occurs prior to the point of divergence, the Pilot
Flying (PF) should fly the SDP routing until the airplane is at a safe altitude.
6.16.2.4.1.2.2. (Added) If an engine failure occurs after the point of divergence, the PF should
continue on the filed departure routing until the airplane is at a safe altitude.
6.16.2.4.1.2.3. (Added) Good situational awareness, knowing the point of divergence, average
3-engine climb gradient, terrain, obstacles, and the Mission Sector Altitude (MSA) are key
factors in the decision to continue on the filed departure or to fly the SDP.
6.16.2.4.1.2.4. (Added) Normally, the ground tracks for the filed departure and the SDP do not
diverge until reaching at least 400 feet above the Departure End of the Runway (DER). There
 16                                       AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011


are published Departure Procedures that turn prior to reaching 400FT (e.g., Honolulu IAP).
However, the SDP follows the filed departure at Honolulu.
6.16.2.4.1.2.5. (Added) If an obstacle is depicted on the filed departure path but not on the SDP,
do not compute the obstacle. The rationale for this is as follows:
6.16.2.4.1.2.5.1. (Added) Obstacles prior to filed departure and SDP divergence are not
calculated because the SDP ensures One Engine Inoperative (OEI) obstacle clearance.
6.16.2.4.1.2.5.2. (Added) At the point of divergence, on 4-engines, the airplane is at least 400
feet above DER.
6.16.2.4.1.2.5.3. (Added) If an engine failure occurs before or at the point of divergence, flying
the SDP provides obstacle clearance. If an engine fails at or beyond the point of divergence,
aircraft performance is such that obstacles along the remaining filed departure flight path are
vertically cleared. Obstacles are cleared due to the added flight distance to the obstacle (4-
engine take off ground run vs. CFL), increased climb performance (4-engine climb segment,
quicker acceleration to higher climb speed, and Minimum Climb-Out Speed (VMCO) +10 versus
3- engine climb segment, slower acceleration to lower climb speed, and VMCO), and remaining
3-engine climb performance.
6.22. ORM is a mindset! It must be applied to every aspect of every mission. Each
crewmember must be aware of possible risks that they face on every mission and what the crew
will do to safely mitigate these risks. The mission begins at show time and ends when the
mission paperwork is completed at Dover.
6.22.1. (Added) Dover crews will utilize the AMC web-based ORM application to the max
extent possible to compute their ORM for the beginning of each duty day. In the event that the
web-based application is unavailable, utilize the Mission Air Forces (MAF) Mission Aviation
ORM Worksheet. A copy of either worksheet (web-based or paper) will be kept by the crew and
turned in with other post-mission paperwork (i.e. computer flight plan and Oceanic Plotting
Chart (OPC)).
6.22.2. (Added) ACs must brief ORM to all members of their crew in detail during the mission
brief (local training and home station departures) and reassess things that have changed.
Additionally, ACs will ensure each crewmember is kept abreast of new risks that arise during the
mission. The purpose of this pre-departure briefing is to counteract the risks involved in our
dynamic mission environment and continually assess/update ORM throughout each leg and keep
the entire crew informed.
6.24.2.1. When Concurrent Service (CS) with passengers is taking place, a current and qualified
FE will be at the FE panel as part of the refuel team. However, the AC is still responsible for all
aspects of aircraft operations. This will allow the AC and/or other crewmembers to tend to
official duties (i.e. filing flight plans, weather updates, etc.).
6.24.5.1. This is not to imply that crewmembers will be used to perform maintenance engine
runs under normal conditions.
6.24.5.2. (Added) The following procedures will be used when accomplishing a maintenance
engine run or motor:
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                          17


6.24.5.2.1. (Added) Engine runs will be performed with aircrew occupying all crew positions in
their respective positions (P, CP, FE, and S). If an emergency is encountered, the crew will
perform the prescribed procedure(s) IAW the flight manual.
6.24.5.2.2. (Added) The appropriate FE and scanner preflight shall be accomplished prior to
running engines.
6.24.5.2.3. (Added) Prior to engine start, the type of run, duration, and throttle setting
procedures will be briefed to all members of the crew.
6.24.5.2.4. (Added) The scanner is required to be in plain view of the pilot for engine runs above
idle.
6.24.5.2.5. (Added) Flight engineers may perform pilot duties during motoring, provided a
sufficient number of qualified flight engineers are available to perform duties at the engineer and
scanner positions.
6.24.5.3. (Added) The following are examples of conditions which constitute routine engine
runs and/or wet/dry motors:
6.24.5.3.1. (Added) Corrected fluid leaks.
6.24.5.3.2. (Added) Component replacement.
6.24.5.3.3. (Added) Electrical malfunctions.
6.24.5.4. (Added) The following are some examples when a flight crew would NOT perform an
engine run:
6.24.5.4.1. (Added) A known engine malfunction that has not been corrected.
6.24.5.4.2. (Added) Engine trim runs; fuel package changes; engine vibrations; starting
malfunctions, etc.
6.24.5.4.3. (Added) When qualified maintenance is readily available. However, use good
judgment; if it will take an excessive amount of time to assemble an engine run team, it is
appropriate for the flight crew to perform a routine engine run.
6.24.5.5. (Added) Ultimately, the decision to run an engine rests with the flight crew. If you are
uncertain whether or not the maintenance performed requires an engine run (refer to TO 1C-5A-
1-4CL-2, Flight Crew Checklist Flight Engineer, 1 July 2007), do not run the engine and contact
the 436/512 OGV on-call FE for guidance. If a MRT is necessary, do not hesitate to request
support.
6.24.6. (Added) Integrating Maintenance and Operations Personnel.
6.24.6.1. (Added) Maintenance and aircrew procedures often differ including required verbal
responses, number of required personnel, and omission or addition of checklist items. Due to
checklist and training differences, under normal conditions, do not mix personnel. However,
there are times when mixing personnel is appropriate. Apply the following guidance:
6.24.6.1.1. (Added) Most procedures should be maintenance only or operations only.
Exceptions: Certain ground operations such as operating the ramps, doors, kneeling (Right
scanner only), clearing APUs (no passengers on board), or clearing flight controls may involve a
 18                                        AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011


mix of flight crew and maintenance personnel. These are exceptions; they should be used only
when sufficient personnel are not available.
6.24.6.1.2. (Added) Mandatory Operations. Under non-emergency conditions, either all
maintenance or all aircrew conducts operations, such as running or motoring engines and towing.
Maintenance personnel will not accomplish engine or motor runs using aircrew procedures.
Primary crew positions will only be occupied by aircrew from passenger on-load through
passenger off-load. Engine Running On/Offload (EROs) will be accomplished with aircrew in
all crew positions.
6.24.6.2. (Added) General Aircrew Procedures. When it is necessary and appropriate to mix
maintenance and aircrew personnel, aircrew checklists/procedures shall be followed.
Maintenance personnel will be briefed and monitored to ensure adherence to aircrew procedures.
Extra communication may be necessary to ensure required steps are completed properly. When
mixing aircrew and maintenance personnel to accomplish ground operations, the aircrew
maintains overall responsibility for safe operations.
6.24.6.2.1. (Added) Interphone contact should be maintained during kneeling, APU starting, and
door operations. If an interphone malfunction precludes contact, positive visual signals (i.e.
hand-signals) will be briefed and used.
6.24.6.2.2. (Added) If maintenance personnel configure the airplane, the flight crew will review
the aircrew checklist to ensure proper configuration.
6.24.6.3. (Added) General Maintenance Procedures. There are times that FEs must perform
maintenance duties, such as aircraft servicing, certain aircraft inspections and minor
maintenance. When performing these duties, FEs are acting as maintenance personnel and are
required to follow maintenance Technical Orders. Avoid mixing personnel. If qualified
maintenance personnel are available, use them. If required to perform a maintenance function,
adhere to the following guidance:
6.24.6.3.1. (Added) Perform only those duties you are qualified to perform.
6.24.6.3.2. (Added) Thoroughly review maintenance technical data.            Don’t hesitate to call
home-station for advice or expertise.
6.24.6.3.3. (Added) When working with maintenance personnel, review the entire procedure
together; take extra time to cover emergency procedures. Remember that you are performing as
a maintainer, not an operator.
6.42.12. (Added) QFE Altimeter Procedures.
6.42.12.1. (Added) Many airfields in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union use QFE
altimeter settings for altitude instead of the Atmospheric Pressure at Nautical Height (QNH)
altimeter settings with which most AMC pilots are familiar. When below transition altitude,
controllers at these locations will always issue altitudes in QFE even if pilots ask for and set a
QNH altimeter setting. When using QFE, if the altimeter settings are not flown correctly
(especially for airfields located at altitudes greater than one thousand feet) the potential for loss
of the aircraft due to controlled flight into terrain increases. Therefore, AMC pilots will review
QFE procedures before transiting a location where QFE is used.
6.42.12.2. (Added) Arrival at a QFE airfield. At high elevation airfields like Dushanbe,
Tajikistan, it may be impossible to set the assigned QFE. If this is the case, and you can set
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                           19


QNH in your altimeter, pilots may fly QNH but, when assigned an altitude below transition
altitude, must add the field elevation to the assigned QFE altitude for a correct altitude to ensure
safe separation from the ground.
6.42.12.2.1. (Added) If it is not possible to set the QFE on the altimeter, but is possible to set
QNH on the altimeter, you may fly QNH (with appropriate conversion from meters to feet)
corrected for field elevation. OGV does not recommend this option.
6.42.12.2.2. (Added) If the assigned altimeter setting is below 28.10 inches (lower than 0951),
apply the appropriate correction factor to your assigned altitude. See AFMAN 11-217V1,
Instrument Flight Procedures, 3 January 2005, for the altimeter correction factors table for
altimeter settings less than the altimeter lower limit.
6.42.12.2.3. (Added) This table uses a ratio of 10 feet for every .01-inch difference between the
actual altimeter setting and the lower or upper limit set in the altimeter. For example, if your are
given 0948 for an altimeter setting, convert to 28.00, set 28.10, and add 100 feet to your assigned
altitudes. This procedure applies to QFE altimeter settings with QFE altitudes and QNH
altimeter settings with QNH altitudes. We do not recommend mixing QNH altimeter settings
with QFE altitudes.
6.45. Make every effort to completely troubleshoot each discrepancy to provide maintenance
with as much data as possible.
6.45.1. (Added) Aircrew personnel will turn over Form 781s, C-5 Fatigue Tracking Record, and
AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log, to the maintenance debrief section to
accomplish a thorough aircrew/maintenance debrief.
6.45.2. (Added) For Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC), the aircrew flying the last period
will turn-in all Form 781s, C-5 Fatigue Tracking Record, and AF Form 664 to the debrief
section.
6.46.1.3. (Added) Use the following procedures to control access to the aircraft until customs
and agriculture clearance is received:
6.46.1.3.1. (Added) When the aircraft reaches the parking spot, the scanner and the aft flight
deck LM go to the crew entrance door. The LM will have all required customs documents ready
for inspection.
6.46.1.3.2. (Added) After the scanner has deplaned (crew chiefs do not deplane), the LM takes a
position at the top of the crew entrance door ladder, and makes sure access to the aircraft is
limited to only customs or agriculture personnel until final clearance is received. All aircraft
doors, except the crew entrance door, are to remain closed until cleared by agriculture personnel.
6.46.1.3.3. (Added) The scanner assumes a position at the foot of the crew ladder and helps the
LM control access to the aircraft, when outside duties permit. If a medical or aircraft emergency
exists, medical and fire department personnel are allowed access to the aircraft prior to customs
clearance.
6.46.1.3.4. (Added) To avoid unnecessary delays, make sure all Distinguished Visitors (DVs)
are briefed on customs procedures and all forms are properly documented before landing at the
CONUS Airport of Entry (AOE). The LM collects the DV’s individual declarations and present
them, along with the aircrew's individual declarations, to the customs agent. Personally brief the
DVs concerning the status of their customs clearance requirements, after the customs agent
 20                                        AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011


reviews the customs declarations. Passengers not in a US military uniform entering CONUS
must clear both customs and immigration. Immigration does not normally meet the aircraft, but
clears passengers at the passenger terminal. When DVs and their traveling party are onboard and
not in uniform, the AC should request immigration meet the aircraft with customs. The aft flight
deck LM will make sure DVs clear both customs and immigration at the aircraft before
departing. If immigration does not meet the aircraft, direct the DVs to the passenger terminal to
clear immigration.
6.50.1. Home Station Departures. Under non-emergency conditions, crewmembers will ensure
inspection due dates are valid through the planned mission duration. No additional time pad is
required. Away from home station, if the mission is delayed and an inspection becomes overdue,
it does not mean the equipment is unusable.
6.50.1.1. (Added) IAW TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection,
Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, 30 April 2003, the overdue inspection will be entered
as a discrepancy in the Form 781A using a Red Dash symbol. Crewmembers will continue to
preflight overdue equipment IAW the Flight Manual.
6.50.3. Upon arrival at the aircraft, verify all equipment listed on the AFTO Form 46,
Prepositioned Life Support Equipment, is onboard and sign the Form 46. This will be done prior
to departing Dover for all locals and missions as well as at all en route crew rest locations.
Crews DO NOT have to break seals on any equipment containers or bags, but must verify seal
numbers match the seal numbers annotated on the Form 46. If crews choose to break the seals to
verify the quantity of items in the containers or bags, they will be required to re-seal and annotate
the new seal numbers on Form 46.
6.50.3.1. (Added) Once a seal is broken on any of the life support equipment storage containers
or bags, crews will ensure all equipment is placed back into the appropriate storage container.
The container will then be re-sealed with one of the seals from the trip kit. This will be done
prior to entering crew rest at en route stops and prior to departing the aircraft after returning to
Dover. After containers or bags are re-sealed, crews will annotate the new seal number and the
date sealed on the Form 46.
6.50.3.2. (Added) SQs will ensure all trip kits contain an adequate number of seals.
6.50.4.6. (Added) When storage containers or bags are opened initially for mission
requirements, crews will do an inventory. If any items are missing, annotate missing items on
the Form 46 and make an entry in the Form 781A. Crews will call the Dover Aircrew Flight
Equipment (AFE) shop and provide them with the tail number, A/C name, and a list of missing
items. If the items are taken from the aircraft while away from home station, crews will contact
local C2 and then contact Dover.
6.50.6. (Added) Dover AFE is manned 24/7. Call the AFE shop though CP for assistance when
an oxygen mask is not working properly. A spare "quick don" oxygen mask assembly is stored
above the relief crew coat rack. This spare mask is available to be used whenever necessary to
prevent mission delays, however, AFE should be contacted if time permits. Usage of the spare
mask is documented on the AFTO Form 46 and in the Form 781A.
6.59.9. (Added) Destruction of Communications Security (COMSEC) and Documentation.
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                         21


6.59.9.1. (Added) All crewmembers shall use the procedures outlined below to properly
document the destruction of COMSEC material from the SKL. Like paper COMSEC materials,
it is now a requirement to witness the destruction of COMSEC on the SKL (deleting superseded
information) and document this action on the provided Electronic Key Disposition Record Card
(DRC) with both the signature of the individual destroying the COMSEC (deleting the codes)
and the witness.
6.59.9.2. (Added) Whenever pilots are required to delete superseded COMSEC material from
the SKL, they must also document this action on the corresponding DRC and both the pilot
destroying and the individual witnessing the destruction are required to sign the DRC. If you
turn on the SKL during the course of the day, as you perform your inventory, the contents of the
SKL will be ―inventoried‖, or compared against the DRC/AMC Electronic Key Log for the SKL.
6.59.9.3. (Added) The DRC form itself is classified ―confidential‖ and must be kept secure with
COMSEC at all times. When all COMSEC is returned to Base Operations, Crew COMM or
Airfield Management Operations personnel will verify DRCs for accuracy and confirm the card
coincides with the SKL.
6.61. (Added) Aircraft Post Flight Duties.
6.61.1. (Added) When the aircraft returns to parking, sufficient time will be allowed for aircrew
personnel to complete customs/agriculture requirements (as required) and post mission
checklists. All support personnel (maintenance, fleet service, passenger service, and aerial port)
will wait at least twenty minutes or until cleared by the aircrew, before boarding aircraft to
perform their respective duties.
Exception: Only those personnel who have an immediate need to be on the aircraft will be
allowed to enplane. Those personnel usually will be limited to one or two passenger service
representatives, one maintenance debrief specialist, and one ATOC representative. Additionally,
with AC concurrence, a limited number of maintenance specialists may be allowed on board to
evaluate in flight discrepancies prior to de-powering their respective systems. This will allow
both aircrew and support personnel to accomplish post flight duties in a timely manner without
interference from one another.
6.62. (Added) Local Operating Procedures.
6.62.1. (Added) Runway 14 Operations.
6.62.1.1. (Added) Runway 14 may only be used to recover aircraft when crosswind and runway
conditions prevent aircraft from landing on other runways. Runway is normally used only for
takeoffs.
6.62.2. (Added) Noise Abatement Procedures.
6.62.2.1. (Added) Noise sensitive areas are depicted on wall maps in Base Operations, Building
501. Brief noise abatement procedures on all Dover local training missions.
6.62.2.2. (Added) VFR Traffic. C-5 VFR traffic operates east of the base. Initiate turns to
crosswind past the departure end of Runway 19 or north of Little Creek for Runway 01. Fly
Runway 01/19 downwind at either 1nm east or 1nm west of the coast line so as to avoid flying
over the villages of Pickering Beach and Kitts Hummock.
 22                                      AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011


6.62.2.3. (Added) Sensitive Areas. Avoid direct over-flight of residential areas in the Dover
local area as much as possible. The most sensitive areas that must not be over-flown are:
6.62.2.4. (Added) The Little Creek, Pickering Beach, Kitts Hummock, Magnolia, and Bowers
Beach villages.
6.62.2.5. (Added) Historical farm building. Approximately located on the 20 degree radial, 1.0
Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) from the Dover TACAN (distinguished by a large round
barn).
6.62.2.6. (Added) John Dickinson Mansion. Approximately located on the 160 degree radial,
2.0 DME from the Dover TACAN.
6.62.2.7. (Added) Cities. Flight over the cities of Dover, Milford, and Harrington is not
permitted below 3000' MSL unless on radar vectors for approach.
6.62.2.8. (Added) Do not deviate from ATC assigned headings or altitudes without prior
coordination. ATC instructions/directives take precedence over noise abatement procedures.
6.62.3. (Added) Standard Climb Out Instructions.
6.62.3.1. (Added) Runway 01. Climb and maintain 3000' MSL, fly runway heading. Maintain
runway heading until north of Little Creek, (2 DME from the Dover TACAN) prior to starting
turns to the east.
6.62.3.2. (Added) Runway 19. Climb and maintain 3000' MSL, fly runway heading and remain
clear of the town of Magnolia.
6.62.3.3. (Added) Runway 14. Climb and maintain 3000' MSL, fly a heading of 150 degrees
and remain clear of the villages of Kitts Hummock and Bowers Beach.
6.62.3.4. (Added) Runway 32. Climb and maintain 3000' MSL, turn right to heading 360 at .8
DME west of the Dover TACAN. Delay flap retraction until 2000' MSL or pattern altitude (if
remaining in the VFR pattern).
6.62.4. (Added) Accomplish multiple 180 degree turns for training or evaluation in the center
portion of runway 01/19 or the approach ends of Runway 14/32 only. A single 180 degree turn
at the end of the runway 01/19 for arrivals and departures is permitted. Make this turn at the
extreme end of the runway, just before the threshold, so jet blast midway through the turn is not
directed at the Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI) lights.
7.13. Arming will be IAW the governing Operation Plan (OPLAN), Operation Order (OPORD)
or Mission Directive.
8.4.3. (Added) To ensure timely dissemination of AMC Form 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency
and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet, PICs shall ensure the "Aircraft Commander actions" on the
Form 97 Fax/E-mail cover sheet are complied with prior to the crew entering crew rest. For
local missions, these actions will be completed before departing the SQ. The current Fax/E-mail
cover sheet and checklist can be found on e-Publications.
8.14. (Added) AFTO Forms 781 Series Procedures during Stage Operations.
8.14.1. (Added) When flying non aircraft, the AC or his/her designee will complete an Form 781
extract for turn-in to the Squadron Aviation Resource Manager (SARM). The AC will also
ensure the original Form 781(s) remain with the aircraft forms.
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                          23


8.14.
2. (Added) Extracts are not required for Dover crews flying Dover airplanes. Be sure the Form
781 is completed and is in the aircraft forms prior to leaving the airplane.
8.15. (Added) Stan/Eval Notification.
8.15.1. (Added) Notify SQ Stan/Eval personnel anytime a safety-related report required by AFI
11-2C-5V3 is submitted. SQ Stan/Eval personnel will then notify OG Stan/Eval (OGV) of the
event.
9.5.1. FPs who have not completed the AC AR Qualification course will be limited to the pre-
contact position.
9.5.2. FPs may only perform tactical maneuvers on local training sorties or in the simulator.
Exception: FPs acting in the next highest qualification level who have been identified for the
Pilot Checkout (PCO) program and have completed AC TET requirements will be allowed to fly
tactical maneuvers in the AOR on an Local Training Mission (LTM)/Operational Mission
Evaluation (OME) under the supervision of a TET certified IP/EP.
9.13. (Added) Preparation of DD Form 365-4 for Local Training Missions.
9.13.1. (Added) Certified DD Forms 365-4 are maintained in Base Operations for several
common fuel loads. These forms are reviewed every 180 days and re-dated unless a change is
involved. Local computations list 12 crewmembers and ramp fuel. The DD Form 365-4 is valid
for four to 15 crewmembers.
9.13.2. (Added) The flight engineer will compute the weight and balance form if last minute
aircraft changes or other, unforeseen circumstances occur. Standard procedures are used for
completing the DD Form 365-4, except for References 5, 6, and 7 listed in ADDENDA A (Basic
Instruction), C-5 Operations Configuration and Mission Planning.
9.14. (Added) Alternative Training Bases.
9.14.1. (Added) Dover crews may conduct training at routine use airfields (―Familiar Fields‖) as
depicted in the 436 OG OI 11-10, Dover AFB Aircrew Flimsy, 17 June 2008. Additionally,
crews should review the FCB, Form 59, and/or Daily Flying Schedule for any restrictions to
multiple practice approaches at locations other than home station. SQ/CC or SQ/DO approval is
required before training at any other alternative base.
9.15. (Added) Command and Control (C2).
9.15.1. (Added) Training priorities for LTMs will be established through the daily scheduling
process. Exceptions will be coordinated through the CP/DO and resolved by the 436/512
OG/CCs.
9.15.2. (Added) Local training sorties may be terminated prior to scheduled duration if training
is complete. Coordinate early termination with SQ/DO (436 OG) or 512 OG/CC or on-call OG
staff officer (512 OG) through Dover CP.
9.15.3. (Added) ACs will obtain approval from their respective OG/CC and maintenance
through coordination with CP if they wish to continue flying past scheduled sortie duration.
 24                                        AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011


9.15.4. (Added) The AC will call Dover CP with an estimated block time and maintenance
status, no later than (NLT) 30 minutes prior to planned block-in.
9.15.5. (Added) Upon termination of all training missions, the AC will relay actual flying time,
landing fuel, and training completion status to Dover CP.
9.16. (Added) Local Training Termination. Local training flights terminate at 2200L and are
extended to 2300L during Phase II of the BASH. Training missions scheduled on the daily
flying schedule are approved until the time on the schedule, but should avoid multiple
approaches in the local pattern past scheduled termination time, unless necessary to complete
training. Flights that extend beyond these times require 436 OG/CC or 512 OG/CC approval.
9.17. (Added) Engines Running Crew Change (ERCC) Procedures.
9.17.1. (Added) ERCC Area. The crew change area is taxiway Alpha in front of the transient
ramp and the control tower (abeam parking spot "B" facing East). The alternate ERCC spot is on
Taxiway Charlie, facing Taxiway Alpha, south of Runway 14/32.
9.17.2. (Added) ERCC Reference Line. To ensure proper parking in the ERCC, white lines are
painted on the left side of Taxiways Alpha and Charlie. When utilizing the ERCC spot, the pilot
will stop when the pilot’s side window is abeam this line. Proper parking will ensure taxing
aircraft have adequate wing tip clearance.
9.17.3. (Added) TOLD. The first period flight engineer will compute takeoff data for the
arriving crew. This data will be validated by the second period crew prior to departure.
9.17.4. (Added) Checklist Procedures. Complete the After Landing checklist (asterisk items
only) and taxi the airplane to the crew change area. After stopping the airplane, run the Block-In
checklist (asterisk items only).
9.17.5. (Added) One pilot remains in the seat at all times to guard the brakes and monitor the
radios. Before assuming scanner duties, the new scanner will perform a quick walk around
inspection. The new crew starts the checklist with the Before Taxi checklist (asterisk items
only).
9.17.6. (Added) First period ERCC crews will land at the scheduled time unless a new time is
coordinated through the Dover CP. Dover CP will coordinate approval for the new time with the
SQ flying the second period.
9.17.7. (Added) Obtain approval from the AC before leaving the aircraft while on the ground
with engines running.
9.18. (Added) Ground Training Time.
9.18.1. (Added) Pilot crewmembers will coordinate their pre-launch activities and training to
arrive at the aircraft NLT one hour prior to scheduled departure.
9.19. (Added) Flare Training Missions. The Master Safety Pin shall be INSTALLED and the
DS shall not be reconfigured to dispense flares until the aircraft is in the designated flare training
area. The Master Safety Pin shall be re-INSTALLED prior to departing the flare training area.
12.2. The primary flight engineer will be designated on the flight authorization and will review
all forms and logs completed by the flight engineers for accuracy and completeness. The
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                         25


primary will be responsible for the conduct, duty performance, and appearance of all flight
engineers for the duration of the mission and will correct any breaches of flight discipline.
12.4.4. (Added) The flight engineer will check pilot and co-pilot rudder pedals and seat
adjustment mechanisms for proper operation and the cleanliness of the windscreen.
12.4.5. (Added) Spare MADAR Card. All missions departing Dover will have one spare
MADAR Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) card.
12.7.6. (Added) All nonstandard configuration takeoff data should be computed using a Take-
off Rated Thrust (TRT). This includes nonstandard flaps and slats, brake and anti-skid
malfunctions, deactivated flight controls, or any flight involving ABDR procedures.
Exception: A TRT Rolling Takeoff may be necessary when the Runway Condition Reading
(RCR)/Runway Surface Condition (RSC) preclude a standing takeoff.
12.14. The scanner will ensure that a fan stopper, 4 fan sticks, and a maintenance ladder are on
board the aircraft prior to all home station departures except depot inputs/returns.
12.16.3. (Added) Aircraft transiting locations without tire changing capabilities may continue
with the current tires installed, even though they may have reached worn removal criteria
provided there is no other damage evident. Worn tires must be changed at the next location with
tire changing capabilities.
12.17. (Added) TF-39 Throttle Alignment Write-ups. Reference MADAR and enter the
following in the Form 781A:
12.17.1. (Added) Use N1 to establish the power setting by moving all four throttles in the same
direction to take out linkage play. With engine N1 aligned, record:

Table 12.1. (Added) Throttle alignment template.

2.17.2.(Added) With the engine throttles aligned, record the above parameters a second time.
13.1.1. (Added) The primary LM will be annotated on the orders and is a key communication
link between other crew positions and support agencies for loading issues. They are also directly
responsible for the supervision and conduct of other LMs on the crew. They will ensure all
applicable directives are followed. The following guidelines will be adhered to when assigned
this responsibility:
13.1.1.1. (Added) Pre-mission planning. As part of mission planning, the primary LM will
contact Current Operations prior to entering pre-departure crew rest to obtain load/mission
information for all Special Assignment Airlift Mission (SAAMs), Joint Airborne/Air
 26                                     AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011


Transportability Training (JA/ATTs), and Close Watch missions. They will make all necessary
coordination contacts and arrangements. It is highly encouraged to conduct advance
coordination for all other type missions.
Note: For 512 AW crews, the LM scheduler will make the contact for the crew flying the
mission.
13.1.1.2. (Added) Mission show time. Obtain pertinent mission and aircraft information and
ensure ATOC is contacted for load data and cargo brief.
Note: If an early departure is planned, notify all support agencies to ensure adjustments are
made to Sequence of Events (SOE). Assign and brief other LM(s) on duties and responsibilities.
13.1.1.3. (Added) Arrival at aircraft. Complete a walkthrough of all compartments to check for
obvious discrepancies that need immediate attention and correction. Ensure that a full shoring
kit is aboard the airplane. Monitor the SOE and keep the AC and other crew positions informed
of any problems or potential delays. Ensure all required forms are reviewed and signed.
Account for all manifests.
13.1.1.4. (Added) In-flight. Assign LM duties for the arrival station and brief the crew on
requirements upon arrival. Conduct periodic checks of all compartments to ensure cleanliness
and ascertain proper relief/rest periods of other LMs.
13.1.1.5. (Added) Arrival at destination. Coordinate on/off load requirements with local
personnel. Ensure completion of Customs/Agriculture documentation, Form 781, and Dover
Form 306. Ensure all areas are clean (this includes garbage pickup, blankets folded/stowed,
etc.), overhead cargo compartment lights are off (if not needed), and checklists are completed.
13.4.2.2.1. Flying crew chiefs must be manifested unless their name is on the Flight Orders.
Names will not be written on the flight orders. When the flying crew chief must be manifested,
the LM will ensure the passenger manifest is submitted with Form F.
13.4.2.5. The troop compartment LM gives first priority to passenger loading duties NLT 1+10
before departure. This may require delaying meal count or other duties until the passengers are
on board. Deplane ground personnel and close No. 6 service door ASAP after loading. The
troop compartment LM remains on headset and keeps the flight station crew informed of the
passenger boarding and briefing status. The troop compartment LM will ensure the passenger
manifest number matches the actual passengers on board and all hand-carried baggage will stow
beneath the seat before the passenger service representative departs. A check will be made to
ensure adequate emergency equipment is available (i.e. infant preservers and cots) and
emergency hatches/service doors are secure.
13.4.2.7. LMs will not allow passengers to fly unless they can be seated in the seat with both
seat cushions installed and seat belts securely fastened. There are no approved seatbelt
extensions for the C-5.
13.6.4. Bring back and turn in all receipts (AF Form 1297 and AMC Form 305, Receipt For
Transfer of Cash and Vouchers) for unused or over packed meals and money collected which
were turned in at en route, terminating, or RON stations to DAFB In-flight Kitchen for final
disposition. The Dover In-flight Kitchen will issue a receipt to the LM as proof of compliance.
13.7.1. Home Station arrivals. Except when the nature of the load requires it, inbound crews
will not normally be required to download the aircraft without OG/CC approval.
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                          27


13.7.1.1. (Added) Upon arrival at home station, the aircrew configures the aircraft for offload
except when maintenance problems exist in the applicable systems or if notified not to do so by
Dover CP.
13.7.1.2. (Added) The inbound crew:
13.7.1.2.1. (Added) Opens the appropriate cargo doors after clearance from customs and
agriculture.

13.15.2.2. (Added) Troop Compartment. Two 5-gallon Igloos filled with water.
13.16. (Added) Duty Loadmaster Program. Due to the reduction in the number of C-5 airplanes
assigned and LM manning at DAFB, duty LMs will not normally be tasked for duty. The C-5
Aerial Port Expediter (APEX) Program will replace the Duty LM program. However, if the
APEX program needs to be augmented due to mission requirements, duty LMs will still be
tasked with the following guidelines:
13.16.1. (Added) General:

conducting loading operations. Perform an exterior preflight and the Airplane Preparation for
Loading checklist to include checks of the restraint rails, locks, roller conveyors, and the cargo
winches prior to use. When cargo will be positioned so as to prevent the mission LMs from
inspecting the aircraft cargo winches, the duty LMs will inspect them and an annotation will be
placed in the Form 781A to inform the mission crew that they have been checked. Annotate the
Form 781 with and report any discrepancies to the ATOC Duty Controller in CP that would
interfere with cargo on/off-loading operations. If the aircraft has been knelt, check the applicable
items of the Kneeling checklist (i.e. kneeling collars installed correctly and switches in the
correct position). Perform the After Loading checklist.
13.16.4.4.11. (Added) Assume responsibility for on/off-loading IAW TO 1C-5A-9, TO 1C-5A-
9-2, and associated flying and technical directives.

or Non-Commissioned Officer-in-Charge (NCOIC) in CP when a situation arises that precludes
the safe on/off loading of the aircraft.
13.16.4.4.13. (Added) Thoroughly brief the on-coming shift duty LM prior to turning over
responsibilities in the middle of an on/off load (i.e., additional restraint, shoring requirements,
load sequence, etc.).
 30                                      AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011


13.16.4.4.14. (Added) During surge operations, report any problems encountered during the
shift to the ATOC Duty Officer and SQ Stan/Eval.
13.16.4.4.15. (Added) During exercises and ORI operations, report any problems encountered
during the shift to the CDF OIC or NCOIC.
13.16.4.4.16. (Added) Duty LMs are responsible to Ramp Services. At least one hour prior to
beginning their shift, they will contact the ATOC Duty Officer at DSN 677-2300 to provide
contact information and check on the workload for the upcoming shift. For exercises, duty LMs
are responsible to ATOC. Yard Kings are responsible to the DCC APS controller.
13.16.4.4.17. (Added) Report to the Ramp Service office within one hour of notification.
13.16.4.5. (Added) During Mobility Exercises/Contingency Operations:
13.16.4.5.1. (Added) SQs will coordinate to provide two shifts of duty LMs. IAW AFI 11-
202V3, General Flight Rules, 5 April 2006, no duty LM will be required to work longer than a
12-hour shift without OG/CC approval.
Note: Surge duty LMs will be released to their respective squadrons at the end of the surge
period.
13.16.4.5.2. (Added) 436 OG/OGV will furnish one Yard King LM per shift for the purpose of
quality control in the cargo marshalling yard. The ranking Yard King LM will be designated as
the primary and will coordinate with the other Yard King LM and 436 AW/DCC to provide 24-
hour coverage of the marshalling yard.
Note: Yard King LMs will be released to their respective squadrons at the end of the surge
period.
13.16.4.5.3. (Added) The Yard King LM will inform the CDF OIC or NCOIC of all movement
of cargo throughout the yard. The Yard King will also keep the 436 AW/DCC, 436 OG/CC, and
436 OG/OGV informed of any problems.
13.16.5. (Added) Miscellaneous Information:
13.16.5.1. (Added) When mission delays occur due to loads or chalks not being released, aircraft
maintenance, etc., the LMs may be placed on standby until released by ATOC with concurrence
of the ramp services supervisor.
13.16.5.2. (Added) All questions pertaining to the duty LM duties and responsibilities should be
addressed to the 436 OG/OGV C-5 Stan/Eval LM section.
17.1.2. Aircrews should use ORM to mitigate the many different risks associated with these
tactical maneuvers. It is the responsibility of the AC to weigh all the risks, evaluate the day’s
unique circumstances, and make safe decisions.
17.4.8. Dover aircrews are prohibited from flying low altitude ingress routes at less than 1000
feet AGL regardless of their certification level unless, in the opinion of the AC, it would be
unsafe to do otherwise. Under those rare circumstances, route the deviation back through your
OGV office ASAP.
17.7.1. Dover aircrews are prohibited from flying low altitude egress routes at less than 1000
feet AGL regardless of their certification level unless, in the opinion of the AC, it would be
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                           31


unsafe to do otherwise. Under those rare circumstances, route the deviation back through your
OGV office ASAP.
17.7.1.1. (Added) AMC guidance allows pilots to retract flaps prior to 1000 feet AGL, but does
not require it. Requirements that qualify for early flap retraction include necessity due to actual
threat environment, safe altitude for obstacle clearance, safe airspeed, and theater tactician
planned routing. Aircrews shall meet ALL of these requirements before considering early flap
retraction, paying complete attention to thorough obstacle and terrain avoidance planning since
obstacle avoidance is still the aircrew's responsibility.
17.12. (Added) Guidance for Airlift Defensive System (ADS) Operations.
17.12.1. (Added) Countermeasures Dispensing Set (CMDS) Preflight. The number of flares
loaded can differ from the quantity indicated on the CMDS. If this discrepancy was noted during
the initial upload, it should be documented in the Form 781A. The AFTO Form 781H, will still
reflect the total loaded. Since there is a difference between the indicated quantity and the total
loaded, the scanner will visually verify the number of flares onboard. If a Form 781A entry was
not in the forms or is not accurate, record the discrepancy.
17.12.1.1. (Added) If the discrepancy has not been recorded in the forms, contact a maintenance
specialist to ascertain the status of the system. If already documented and the counters are
reading at or above the minimum number of flares required, consider the system operational.
The discrepancy is caused by the dispenser failing to electrically recognize a loaded flare. A
faulty flare, dispenser, wiring, or Central Processing Unit (CPU) is among the possible causes.
With a malfunction of this nature, functioning flares can still be dispensed. The CMDS bypasses
the flares that do not ―register‖ and sends a signal to a functional flare located in the same area.
17.13. (Added) C-5 Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM) System.
17.13.1. (Added) C-5 aircraft are being modified with an IRCM system. An IRCM system is
considered operational when the aircraft is modified by AFTO 1C-5-799, Installation of
AN/AAQ-24 (V) Infrared Countermeasures System (IRCM) on Selected C-5 Aircraft, 1 January
2009, (annotated in the Form 781) and has two, Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures
(LAIRCM) Lite, or three, LAIRCM Full, Pointer Tracker Assemblies (PTAs) installed.
17.13.2. (Added) Operate the IRCM system IAW current Tech Data, classified guidance
available from the Tactics Office, applicable aircrew checklists, and the IRCM training program.
17.13.2.1. (Added) The IRCM system requires a classified User Data Module (UDM) card
installed in the Control Indicator Unit (CIU) to operate. These UDM cards are specific to the
LAIRCM configuration installed on the aircraft (i.e. a card will work on any jet in the LAIRCM
Lite configuration but will not work on a jet in the LAIRCM Full configuration and vice versa.).
For all home station departures where the IRCM system will be powered (to include local
training sorties), the pilots will sign out the classified UDM card from Base Operations along
with other COMSEC materials. Upon entering crew rest, the UDM card must be removed from
the CIU and stored just like any other classified material (it may be stored in the same bag as the
other COMSEC materials.). Once an airplane is in the system, the UDM card stays with the
airplane, not the crew. In the event that the original crew leaves an airplane with an operational
IRCM system while away from Dover, they must sign the UDM card over to the new crew or
leave the card with a responsible agency (i.e. Command Post) so that it may be turned over to the
 32                                       AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011


subsequent crew. Upon arrival back at Dover, the UDM card will be turned back in to Base
Operations.
17.13.3. (Added) MEL/OPORD Considerations:
17.13.3.1. (Added) The IRCM system is designed to work in conjunction with the CMDS. If
either the IRCM/CMDS system or the Missile Warning System (MWS)/CMDS system is
operational, the aircraft will be considered to have an operational Defensive System.
17.14. (Added) Minimum Flare Load. Unless otherwise stated in the Concept of Operations
(CONOPS), OPORD, Special Instructions (SPINS), or mission cut, the minimum recommended
flare load is three dispenses.
17.14.1. (Added) Refer to unclassified C-5 Defensive Systems In-Flight Guide, 2 Oct 2009,
available from 436 OSS/OSK for information on C-5 flare patterns. Aircrews are responsible for
calculating minimum flare loads based on the flare pattern loaded.
17.14.2. (Added) If the airplane has less than the minimum number of flares or a malfunction
renders a given dispenser inoperative, crews will NOT consider the defensive system operative.
17.14.2.1. (Added) Depending on the mission requirements, the mission MAY still continue;
refer to the CONOPS, OPORD, SPINS, or mission cut to determine the proper course of action.
17.14.2.2. (Added) Crews may need to contact TACC for further guidance.
17.15. (Added) Flare Safety Procedures.
17.15.1. (Added) Transporting Assembled Flares. Assembled flares will not be transported in
the C-5 cargo compartment. An assembled flare consists of an Infrared Flare and an Impulse
Cartridge. Assembled flares can only be carried in the CMDS dispensers.
17.15.1.1. (Added) Any flare transported inside the airplane must be shipped IAW governing
regulations (i.e. processed, packaged, and treated as hazardous cargo). In no case should a built-
up flare be transported inside the airplane. There is no established waiver authority to this
policy.
17.15.1.2. (Added) Built-up flares may be temporarily stored in the cargo compartment while
the airplane is on the ground. This allows maintenance to download flares, perform
maintenance, and then either reload the flares or enter them in the transportation system.
17.15.1.3. (Added) While flares are being up-loaded into the dispensers, ensure no other
maintenance or loading operation is being performed on the aircraft and only essential personnel
are in the loading area.
17.16. (Added) Flare Inspection Procedures.
17.16.1. (Added) If flares have been dispensed during the flight or if the counters indicate fewer
flares than before takeoff, a hung flare inspection is required after landing. Advise Tower and/or
Ground Control of your requirement to conduct the inspection.
17.16.2. (Added) After landing, accomplish the following:
17.16.2.1. (Added) Exit the runway and continue to the designated arm/de-arm area. If no such
area is identified, exit the runway onto a taxiway or area that provides the maximum separation
AFI11-2C-5V3_DOVERAFBSUP 8 AUGUST 2011                                                          33


from congested areas. If possible, maintain a minimum separation of 600 feet from inhabited
buildings and other aircraft.
17.16.2.2. (Added) Perform the Quick Stop checklist and deplane the scanner to inspect the
dispensers for hung munitions. A hung flare is one that has penetrated or is protruding, but has
not fully exited from the magazine and/or the weather seal is damaged or missing. Exercise
extreme caution while inspecting dispensers on the wing torque boxes due to jet blast and engine
danger areas.
17.16.2.3. (Added) Approach the dispensers with caution and do not approach any closer than
necessary to inspect for a hung flare. The preferred inspection sequence is: Visor area, left
outboard wing, left inboard wing, right outboard wing, and right inboard wing.
17.16.3. (Added) If the inspected areas are safe, proceed to normal parking.
17.16.4. (Added) If an unsafe condition is found, immediately notify the pilot of the hung flare
condition and location and suggest appropriate exit door(s).
17.16.4.1. (Added) If there is evidence of hung munitions, the pilot will declare an emergency
with the appropriate agency and shut down engines using normal checklists. Deplane passengers
and crew from an unaffected area (i.e. hung flare in the visor area, use 7L or 7R). Ensure that the
area used to deplane is visually checked prior to deplaning.
17.16.4.2. (Added) In the event of fire, be prepared to egress. Initially move to a safe distance
(at least 75 feet) away from the hung flare. In case of fire, withdraw all non-essential personnel
to a minimum distance of 600 feet away from the aircraft.
17.16.4.3. (Added) The senior emergency response member will determine further action to
eliminate or minimize the hazard.
17.17. (Added) Inadvertent Flare Launch Notification.
17.17.2. (Added) Following an inadvertent flare launch, crews will notify the nearest C2 agency
or 436 AW/CP ASAP with the information shown in [NO LABEL MAPPING for "Table"!
17.1. The secure line to CP is DSN 677-4190, but the duty controller must be called first at DSN
677-4201 before receiving a call via secure.

17.17.3. (Added) If the first station has only non-secure communications, call the 436 AW/CP
and notify the duty controller with only the AC's name, tail number, and location of the
inadvertent flare launch. Follow up with the rest of the requested information at the first station
with secure communications.
