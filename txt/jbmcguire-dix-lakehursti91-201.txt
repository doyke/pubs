      operations involving licensed AE. These procedures must include AE limits, personnel
      limits, location of operation, safety requirements, step-by-step procedures for doing the
      task, and actions to be taken during an emergency or when abnormal conditions are
      noted.
      7.1.3. Expended Brass: Units will store expended brass in the licensed facility until
      they can turn items over to 305 MXS/MSA, Inspection Section, for inspection and
      certification process. Unit supervisors of licensed facilities need to remember that the
      quantity of brass is considered as part of their allocation for that license. Expended brass
      must be stored in containers and properly marked indicating the types and approximate
      quantity per storage container. Expended brass will be turned over to the MSA as
      scheduled by the 305 MXS Inspection Section supervisor.
      7.1.4. Dunnage: Munitions will be stacked on dunnage to allow ventilation. Munitions
      will not be stacked against walls to allow full circulation of air around assets. (Ref: T.O.
      11A13-10-7, Small Arms)
8. Transportation
