This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 14-2, Intelligence Rules and
Procedures, and is consistent with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 14-202, Volume 1, Intelligence
Training, AFI 14-202, Volume 2, Intelligence Standardization/Evaluation Program, and AFI 14-
202, Volume 3, General Intelligence Rules. This publication prescribes standard intelligence
procedures to be used by all personnel performing intelligence duties in B-2 units. This
publication applies to Regular Air Force (RegAF), Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG)
intelligence personnel supporting B-2 operations. The National Guard Bureau will be considered
functionally as a major command (MAJCOM) for the purposes of this publication. Ensure that
all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with (IAW) Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and
disposed of IAW Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force
Records Information Management System (AFRIMS). This AFI may be supplemented, but all
supplements must be coordinated with the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) prior to
certification and approval. Refer recommended changes to the OPR using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication. Route AF Form 847 through the appropriate
functional chain of command. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this
publication are identified with a tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance
statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for a description of the
authorities associated with the tier numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change adds risk factors, known as “tiers” to tasks assigned to organizations below
major command (MAJCOM) level to depict the assessed risk of non-compliance. It also deletes
reference to Statement of Intelligence Interest (SII) as this term is outdated and is no longer a
requirement. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

                       EXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE TRAINING

3.1. Introduction. Qualified external intelligence trainers (EITs) will conduct external
intelligence training. External training includes threat knowledge, visual recognition (VR),
collection and reporting (C&R) and personnel recovery (PR) for both conventional and
nuclearrelated missions under AFGSC authorities. External training for pilots will be
coordinated through the wing/group and squadron Weapons and Tactics Flight or Officer. The
SIO may determine if other unit personnel require external training and will modify training
requirements, as appropriate. (T-2)
3.2. SIO EIT Responsibilities. The SIO will:
   3.2.1. Establish an external intelligence training program tailored to the unit’s mission,
   weapons system, projected tasked OPLANs, conventional wartime/AEF taskings, and
   base/deployment locations. (T-2)
   3.2.2. Appoint in writing an External Intelligence Training Program Manager to oversee
   program execution. The EIT Program Manager may be the same person as the Intelligence
   Personnel Training Program Manager (see AFI 14-2B-2, Volume 1). Where assigned, the
   USAF Intelligence Weapons Instructor Course (IWIC) graduate will be directly involved in
   the external intelligence training program development and execution. (T-3)
   3.2.3. Build an effective training program with input from operational squadrons, weapons
   and tactics representatives, the Nuclear Executive Manager, Aircrew Flight Equipment
   (AFE) personnel, security forces personnel, AF Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI), and
   SERE specialists, as appropriate. (T-2)
   3.2.4. Ensure only qualified EITs conduct unsupervised intelligence training events. EIT
   specialization training requirements and evaluation criteria are identified in AFI 14-2B-2,
   Volumes 1 and 2. (T-2)
   3.2.5. Coordinate the external intelligence training written guidance with the OG/CC,
   detailing how the external training program will be conducted. The external intelligence
   training written guidance will be coordinated with any group and/or organization (e.g.,
   Weapons/Tactics, SERE, ALS, etc.) that assists intelligence personnel in providing training.
   (T-3)
   3.2.6. Authorize proration of training based on unit contingency operations tempo IAW AFI

The purpose of the downed aircrew checklist is to provide the Personnel
Recovery Coordination Cell (PRCC)/Joint Personnel Recovery Center
(JPRC) the required ISOPREP and EPA information to assist in the safe
return of the downed pilot. This checklist will be tailored to meet the
responsibilities as outlined by MAJCOM guidance and the MOA
between the SERE specialist and Intel. In particular, with the
dissemination of the PMRS program, the SERE manager will directly
engage in the forwarding and tracking of SAR operations.
1. Obtain pilot ISOPREP and EPA. Ensure PRC-112 codes (6 digit
number) and blood chit number are written in block 24 on the pilot’s
ISOPREP along with any other SPINS requirement. If PMRS is used,
verify this information is accurate prior to transmittal.
2. E-mail digital ISOPREP to PRCC/JPRC (as applicable) if able
3. Notify the in-theater PRCC/JPRC (as applicable) using secure
communications
4. Secure fax both sides of ISOPREP, as well as the EPA (or e-mail
PRMS data).
5. After transmission is complete DO NOT hang up. Establish secure
voice and verify all parts of the ISOPREP and EPA were received. If
not, pass information verbally.
6. Ask the following questions of the PRCC/JPRC:
6.1. Exact location of downed aircraft
6.2. Bearing and distance from SARDOT
6.3. Magnetic or true?
6.4 Time aircraft was downed
6.5. Are the pilots alive?
6.6. Physical condition of pilots
6.7. Had pilots established radio contact?
6.8. With whom?
6.9. What frequency?

2. IAW the Intelligence Training Plan, all pilots are required to be trained on each training item
at least once each training cycle. At the completion of the annual training cycle, the following
pilots have not completed the annotated training items:
                Name                    Position   Intelligence Training Item
                John A. Doe             Pilot      SA-2, MiG-25, Su-27
                Susan L. Smith          Pilot      MiG-25

                Ed. D. Tyler            Pilot      PR, ISOPREP
3. The annual Intelligence Conventional MQF test was administered on 15 Jan 2007. All CMR
pilots have taken the 100 question test. While not all pilots have obtained the minimum passing
score of 85 percent for conventional mission areas the first time around, all tests have been
corrected to 100 percent. A total of 25 pilots took the test. The initial average test score for the
squadron was 95 percent.

4. The annual intelligence EWO MQF test was administered on 18 Jan 2007. All certified pilots
have taken the 50 question test. Not all pilots obtained the required 100% passing score.
However, EIT reviews on missed items and follow-on testing of missed test areas resulted in
100% passing. A total of 25 pilots took the test. The average test score before remedial training
and retest was 92%.

                missed
5. The most commonly missed questions in the conventional mission area were #5, 8, 13, 14 and
21. After further review of questions 14 and 21, it is likely these questions were missed because
they were poorly worded and difficult to understand. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-
2, SA-6, and MiG-29, respectively. The most commonly missed questions in the EWO mission
area were #5, 7, 8, 12 and 18. Questions 5, 8, and 13 focused on the SA-20, Kh-102, and Su-24
nuclear capabilities, respectively. Questions 12 and 18 focused on collection and reporting
procedures of nuclear-relevant events. The squadron intelligence section will increase emphasis
on these threat systems and procedures during the next training cycle. Attached is a breakout of
the test questions and how many times each question was missed.
