     between the hours of 0730 and 1100, Monday through Friday.
     8.2.2. The unscheduled item must have a completed AFTO Form 350, Repairable Item
     Processing Tag, attached to the item.
     8.2.3. The PMEL scheduler will contact the OWC TMDE coordinator when the item
     repair/calibration is completed and item is ready for pickup.
  8.3. Priority Service Requests: The priority item must be delivered to the PMEL scheduling
  section with a priority request letter, signed by the unit maintenance officer or manager. The
  letter (Attachment 3) must state whether the item requires mission essential or emergency
  calibration or repair, ID Number, Part Number, OWC, date and time the unit is required (Not
  ASAP), and primary and alternate contacts. Priority equipment will be accepted at any time
  with prior telephone coordination with the PMEL scheduler/leadman.
     8.3.1. Mission Essential Calibration or Repair: One-of-a-kind or one-deep TMDE that is
     part of a unit’s deployment package, or is critical to daily operations, or TMDE assets
     falling below critical availability levels. The PMEL will schedule the unit with sufficient
     priority level to ensure the work is completed or the maintenance status changes (i.e.,
     from INW to AWP, DEF, etc.) by the date and time specified by the customer. The
     owning or using organization must pick up the unit immediately upon notification of
     completion. For mission-essential actions that are shipped off base, the PMEL will
     coordinate with AFPSL or the depot via telephone or e-mail of the impending arrival of
     the priority and ship the unit by priority means.
     8.3.2. Emergency Calibration or Repair: For one-of-a-kind TMDE that is inoperable or
     due calibration and for which a critical job is at a work stoppage, the PMEL shall
     immediately place the unit into work. When overtime is authorized, the item will be
     worked continuously until the status changes (e.g., AWP, DEF, etc.). The PMEL
     manager may require an OWC technician familiar with the TMDE to accompany the
     TMDE and remain at the PMEL to provide technical assistance until the item is
     completed or placed in an interim-complete status. The owning or using organization
     must pick up the unit immediately upon notification of completion. For emergency
     actions that are shipped off base, PMEL will coordinate with AFPSL or the depot via
     telephone or e- mail of the impending arrival of the priority and ship the unit by priority
     means.
  8.4. TMDE Overdue Calibration: The PMEL scheduler will notify the TMDE coordinator
  within ten (10) calendar days (20 calendar days for off-base customers), via telephone and/or
  e-mail, of TMDE not delivered on or before the scheduled date due calibration.
  8.5. TMDE Deferred: (Awaiting Parts (AWP) and Hold):
     8.5.1. The PMEL scheduler will notify the OWC within three (3) duty days, when their
     TMDE is placed in AWP or hold status.

       8.5.2. OWC supervisors, TMDE coordinators and the PMEL scheduler will closely
       monitor the status of requisitions against AWP TMDE. When requested, work centers
       must submit mission impact statements to PMEL scheduling section for requisitions that
       have unacceptable estimated delivery dates.
    8.6. Test Equipment Abuse:
       8.6.1. Incidents of TMDE abuse will be elevated to the appropriate level of command
       (Maintenance Supervisor/Branch Chief) for corrective action.
       8.6.2. If necessary, the abused item will be returned to the OWC for corrective actions to
       be accomplished before PMEL scheduling section will accept the item for
       repair/calibration.
    8.7. Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) Policy and Procedures are determined by
    TO 00-5-15, Air Force Time Compliance Technical Order Process, and will be complied
    with by PMEL. All TMDE TCTO’s will be scheduled by the PMEL scheduler based on the
    type TCTO, quantity of items to be modified and length of time to comply with the TCTO.
    TCTO planning and documentation will be IAW AFI 21-101 and applicable technical orders.
