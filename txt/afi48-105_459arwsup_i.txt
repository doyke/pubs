other officer accession programs, and officers that are directly commissioned.
Air Force Reserve Component (ARC)—Reserve forces that include the Air National Guard
and the Air Force Reserve Command
Diseases and conditions of public health or military significance—These are diseases or
health conditions that impact the health or readiness of Air Force personnel, their dependents, or
other eligible personnel and which have a potential for substantial mission degradation,
widespread morbidity, or significant adverse sequelae or mortality.
High—risk TB prevalence country/area—A country or geographical area with a high
prevalence of tuberculosis as determined by the AFIOH in conjunction with the Armed Forces
Medical Intelligence Center (AFMIC), World Health Organization (WHO) and other health
agencies.
Nonreportable STIs— STIs that are not included on the list of Tri-Service Reportable Events.
Patients with these diseases may be referred to PH for education, sexual contact identification,
and follow-up, as appropriate.
Public Health Surveillance—The regular or repeated collection, analysis, and dissemination of
uniform health information for monitoring the health of a population, and intervening in a timely
manner when necessary.
Public Health Emergency Officer (PHEO)—A senior health professions military officer or
DoD civilian employee, designated by the installation commander, with experience in preventive
medicine/ emergency response who is responsible for advising the installation commander in the
exercising of emergency health powers (as outlined in DoDD 6200.3) in the event of a suspected
or confirmed public health emergency.

Screening—A method for early detection of disease or health problem before an individual
would normally seek medical care. Screening tests are usually administered to individuals
without current symptoms, but who may be at high-risk for certain adverse health outcomes.
STIs—These are infections commonly transmitted by sexual intercourse. The diseases specified
in the CDC’s Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines will be considered STIs for
this AFI.
Syndromic Surveillance—The surveillance of disease syndromes (groups of signs and
symptoms), rather than specific, clinical, or laboratory-defined diseases. Surveillance of
syndromes recorded at the time of patient visit, instead of specific diagnoses reported after
laboratory or other diagnostic procedures, can greatly lessen the time it takes to determine that an
outbreak is occurring (ESSENCE is an example of a syndromic surveillance system).

           TUBERCULOSIS (TB) DETECTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM

A3.1. The objective of this program is to align the AF TB program with the national program to
eliminate tuberculosis IAW current CDC guidelines. The AFMS uses current CDC guidelines for
TB prevention and control. The following guidance is intended to cover areas where CDC
guidance is vague or does not exist.
A3.2. The AF TB screening program will be a targeted program. Except for an initial TB test
upon accession (baseline test), the TB testing program for Air Force personnel will be limited to
individuals with high-risk TB exposure histories or those with clinical indications for testing.
A3.3. Military Treatment Facility Commanders.
   A3.3.1. Ensure MTFs implement an effective TB control program IAW current CDC
   guidelines.
   A3.3.2. Ensure a written plan on prevention of transmission and treatment of TB for the
   MTF is completed. The plan will include a multi-disciplinary healthcare team (e.g., Infection
   Control, PH, BEE, etc.) evaluation and a written TB risk assessment IAW CDC guidelines or
   in consultation with AFIOH. The plan will also include appropriate respiratory protection for
   potentially exposed health-care workers, effective engineering controls, education,
   counseling and evaluation of healthcare workers, and identification and treatment of
   individuals with active disease or latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)

   A3.5.1. Evaluates all individuals with non-negative tuberculosis tests. Non-negative tests
   include:
      A3.5.1.1. Tuberculin skin test (TST) indurations greater than or equal to 5mm
      A3.5.1.2. Indeterminate or positive blood assays for M. tuberculosis (BAMT)
   A3.5.2. Records positive reactions, initial and follow-up care on AF Form 2453,
   Tuberculosis Detection and Control Data. Places AF Form 2453 in the patient’s medical
   record upon completion of medical treatment.
   A3.5.3. Ensures all patients with LTBI or active TB are referred to PH for contact tracing,
   education, and reporting.
   A3.5.4. Evaluates patients for active disease. Provides clinical management and follow-up of
   patients with LTBI or active TB IAW CDC guidelines.
   A3.5.5. Ensures recent converters who do not have active TB but who are on flying status,
   have flying status handled IAW current AFMOA LTBI prophylaxis policy. If the services of
   the flyer are of a critical nature, (e.g., in a combat zone or for alert force manning) and active
   TB has been ruled out, INH therapy can be delayed for up to 18 months. During this time the
   flight surgeon will continue to monitor the flyer closely until his/her services are no longer
   critical and INH can be initiated.
A3.6. Immunization Technician or Personnel Administering Tuberculosis Testing.
   A3.6.1. Follow current CDC guidance on testing procedures and interpretation of tests.
   A3.6.2. Immunization clinic personnel and other clinicians with experience or formal
   training can place, read, and record IPPD skin tests.
A3.7. Tuberculin Tests Administration.
   A3.7.1. The AF TB testing program will be a targeted program. Except for an initial TB test
   upon accession, AF personnel (including deployers and other forward-based personnel) will
   only be tested when they have high-risk exposures, high-risk occupations, or are employees
   with clinical indications for testing as per local Aerospace Medicine Council
   recommendation.
      A3.7.1.1. Persons at risk for developing TB disease fall into two categories: those who
      have been recently infected, and those with clinical conditions that increase the risk of
      progression from LTBI to TB disease.
          A3.7.1.1.1. Recent infection should be suspected in close contacts of a person with
          infectious TB, persons who have immigrated from areas of the world with high rates
          of TB, children < 5 years who have a positive TST result, recent converters, persons
          who work or reside with people who are at high risk for TB in facilities or institutions
          such as hospitals, homeless shelters, correctional facilities, nursing homes, and
          residential homes for those with HIV.
          A3.7.1.1.2. Clinical conditions that increase the risk of progression from LTBI to TB
          disease include HIV infection, radiographic evidence of prior TB, low body weight (>
          10% below ideal), silicosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure or being on
AFI48-105_459ARWSUP_I 3 NOVEMBER 2011                                                         27


          hemodialysis, gastrectomy, jejunal bypass, solid organ transplant, history of head and
          neck cancer, and prolonged use of immunosuppressive agents.
A3.8. Types of tuberculin tests.
   A3.8.1. The Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) using Intermediate-strength Purified Protein
   Derivative (IPPD) has been the standard test for identifying LTBI.
   A3.8.2. Blood assays for M. tuberculosis (BAMT) such as the enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests have been approved for diagnosing both LTBI and TB
   disease.
       A3.8.2.1. Quantiferon®- TB Gold (QFT-G) is the first blood test of this type to obtain
       FDA approval. QTF-G can be used in all circumstances in which the TST is used,
       including contact investigations, evaluation of recent immigrants who have had BCG
       vaccination, and TB screening of healthcare workers and others undergoing serial
       evaluation for M. tuberculosis infection.
       A3.8.2.2. BAMT tests usually can be used in place of (and not in addition to) the TST;
       however, the performance of the QFT-G test has not been evaluated in individuals with
       impaired immune function, e.g., HIV, individuals with a high likelihood of M.
       tuberculosis infection progressing to tuberculosis disease, patients who have been treated
       for either LTBI or tuberculosis disease, individuals younger than age 17 years, and
       pregnant women.
A3.9. Indications for TB Screening Tests.
   A3.9.1. Test AD and ARC members during initial processing at officer or enlisted accession
   centers or at their first duty station.
   A3.9.2. Perform annual testing for all individuals stationed in a high-prevalence overseas
   area and who have direct and prolonged contact with high-risk populations or have high-risk
   exposure. Perform another tuberculin test at 3 months (no later than 6 months) after returning
   to CONUS or a low TB prevalence OCONUS location.
   A3.9.3. Combatant Command may direct additional TB testing. When the Combatant
   Command defers to Service policy for TB testing, then the following applies:
       A3.9.3.1. Individuals who deployed to high-prevalence areas for greater than or equal to
       30 consecutive days and who had direct and prolonged contact with the locals population
       or had high-risk or known exposure to an active TB case should receive a TB test at 3
       months (no later than 6 months) post-deployment.
       A3.9.3.2. Testing more frequently than every 12 months is not necessary for personnel
       who deploy regularly to high prevalence areas unless they have other risk factors for TB.
   A3.9.4. Perform baseline two-step TST or one BAMT for healthcare workers (including
   civilians, contractors, and volunteers) upon employment/volunteer service if there is no
   verifiable history of being tested within the previous 12 months. A documented, initial TB
   test done on accession (baseline test) for Air Force personnel is considered the first step of
   the two-step TST. The second step should be completed within twelve months at either the
   first duty assignment or subsequent training program. Repeat or interval testing for
   healthcare workers is based on risk assessment for the setting IAW CDC guidelines or in
 28                                        AFI48-105_459ARWSUP_I 3 NOVEMBER 2011


   consultation with AFIOH. Healthcare workers transferring between healthcare settings or
   AFMS medical treatment facilities that are classified as low risk are not retested. Healthcare
   workers transferring between low and medium risk settings should be tested within 30 days
   of transfer to the medium risk setting location.
   A3.9.5. Perform baseline and subsequent TB testing for family members and other
   beneficiaries IAW CDC guidelines.
      A3.9.5.1. Baseline TB testing is indicated for individuals who are PCSing to a high TB
      prevalence country and who have no verification of having been previously tested.
      Testing should be completed prior to departure.
      A3.9.5.2. Baseline TB testing is indicated prior to overseas travel if individuals
      anticipate prolonged contact with populations in settings at high-risk for transmission of
      infectious TB (e.g., hospital, prison, homeless shelters) and 3 months after returning.
A3.10. Tuberculin Skin Tests.
   A3.10.1. Delay the TST at least four weeks after live-virus vaccine administration, unless
   operational or clinical circumstances require administration of TST on the same day.
   A3.10.2. Measure TST reactions in millimeters of induration and record the results in the Air
   Force automated tracking system, on DD Form 2766, Adult Preventive and Chronic Care
   Flowsheet (or equivalent), on the Public Health Service Form 731, International
   Certification of Vaccination. Do not delete results of previous TB tests in the AF automated
   immunization tracking system.
   A3.10.3. Refer all individuals with TST indurations greater than or equal to 5 mm to PH. If
   active TB is suspected, alert the infection Control Officer, the PCM team, and PH to ensure
   that appropriate precautionary infection control measures are applied.

   DECISION-ASSISTING ALGORITHM FOR DETERMINING HIGH-RISK EXPOSURE

  A4.1. Deployers – Check combatant command preventive medicine requirements for deployed
  location and based on their risk assessment conduct TST if required. If no risk assessment has
  been performed for the deployed location then conduct a local risk assessment using the
  algorithm below

Joint Base Andrews, MD 20762

Subject: Tuberculosis Risk Assessment for the 459th Aerospace Medicine Squadron (459 AMDS)

1. CDC Guidelines require Medical Units to re-evaluate their Tuberculosis risk annually.

2. The following information was obtained from the Center for Disease Control Tuberculosis
Prevention and Control Program website September 2011.

a. Area TB Profile: The following table summarizes the incidence of TB (per 100,000
population) for the year 2009:
                          Location of                   2008 Incident Rate
                           Residence                       (per 100,000)
                      District of Columbia                       6.8
                      Maryland                                   3.8
                      Virginia                                   3.5
                      Combined                                    4.7
b. National TB Profile: The national average TB rate is 3.8 per 100,000 for the year 2009.

3. Assignment risk of the 459th Air Refueling Wing (459 ARW) does not contain any inpatient
facilities. The 459 AMDS does not receive patients while at home station. The conversion rate
at the 459 ARW has not shown an increased rate in personnel. There may be TB cases within
the community and collectively, the State incidence is above the national average. Based on
CDC guidelines, the 459 ARW and the Air Force remains Low Risk.

   4. If you have any questions, please contact Maj Jo Ann Serafini, ICO, Infection Control, at
   (240) 857-3909 during Sunday of the UTA.
