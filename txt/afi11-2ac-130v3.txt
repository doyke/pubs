                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This AFI provides guidelines and restrictions for AC-130 operations and applies
to AC-130 aircrews at all management levels concerned with operation of the AC-130. It is a
compilation of information from aircraft flight manuals, Flight Information Publications (FLIP)
and other Air Force directives, and is an original source document for many areas. This
instruction supersedes all guidance in AFTTPs. It is written for normal and contingency
operations to reduce procedural changes at the onset of contingencies. Training procedures are
included. When guidance in this AFI conflicts with another basic/source document, that
document takes precedence. For matters where this AFI is the source document, waiver
authority is IAW paragraph 1.4. For matters where this AFI repeats information in another
document, follow waiver authority outlined in the basic/source document. HQ AFSOC
Standardization/Evaluation (HQ AFSOC/A3V) has overall responsibility for the administration
of this instruction.
1.2. Applicability. This AFI is applicable to all crewmembers operating the AC-130H/U.
Copies should be made available to all aircrew members operating the AC-130.
1.3. Key Definitions:
   1.3.1. “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. “Should” indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment.
   1.3.3. “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. “WARNING” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which may result in
   personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed.
   1.3.5. “CAUTION” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which may result in
   damage to equipment if not carefully followed.
   1.3.6. “NOTE” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered
   essential to emphasize.
   1.3.7. See Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information for additional
   terms.
1.4. Deviations and Waivers. Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI except
when the situation demands immediate action to ensure safety.
   1.4.1. Although this publication provides guidance for aircraft operations under most
   circumstances, it is not a substitute for sound judgment. When it is necessary to protect the
   crew and aircraft from a situation not covered by this instruction and when immediate action
   is required, the Pilot in Command (PIC) has ultimate authority and responsibility for the
   course of action to be taken. Report deviations, without waiver, through channels to HQ
   AFSOC/A3 within 48 hours, followed by a written report.
   1.4.2. Unless otherwise indicated, HQ AFSOC/A3 is the waiver authority for operational
   procedure requirements contained in this volume. HQ AFSOC/A3 may delegate this
   authority to Commander Air Force Special Operations Forces (COMAFSOF) for
 14                                                          AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


   operationally assigned Special Operations Forces (SOF) during contingency operations. If
   the AFSOC/A3 chooses to delegate waiver authority, it will be done in writing and will
   specify which portions of this instruction may be waived by the COMAFSOF.
       1.4.2.1. When waiver authority is delegated, HQ AFSOC/A3V will receive a copy of all
       approved waivers.
   1.4.3. Crews requiring waivers or technical assistance should contact the controlling agency
   for proper coordination. The PIC must consider all factors (Crew Duty Time/Flight Duty
   Period (FDP), aircrew qualification levels, type mission and sortie duration, weather, Notices
   to Airmen, alternates) before requesting the waiver. It is highly recommended that the PIC
   contact squadron Top 3 (Squadron Commander (CC), Director of Operations & Assistant
   Director of Operations or Operations Group Standardization/Evaluation (OG/OGV) for any
   advice or assistance prior to waiver request (time permitting). Transmit mission data to the
   controlling command and control (C2) agency by any means available (i.e., Defense
   Switching Network (DSN), High-Frequency (HF) radio, Iridium phone and L-Band Satellite
   Communication (SATCOM), etc.).
1.5. Distribution. Limited: Distribute this instruction only as directed in applicable Flight
Crew Information Summary Required Publication Tables.
1.6. Supplements. Major Commands (MAJCOM) may supplement this volume according to
AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and Procedures. These supplements will not duplicate, alter, amend
or be less restrictive than the provisions of this instruction. Forward MAJCOM supplements to
HQ AFSOC/A3V and HQ AFFSA/A3OF for approval before publication and provide
HQ AFFSA/A3OF one copy after publication. File supplements according to AFI 33-360,
Volume 1, Publications Management Program.
   1.6.1. Local Operating Procedures Coordination Process. Units will send one copy of
   Chapter 10 (Local Operating Procedures) supplements to HQ AFSOC/A3V for validation.
1.7. Requisitioning Procedures. This AFI shall only be delivered electronically to the end
user. Printing is at the discretion of the individual units.
1.8. Improvement Recommendations. Send comments and suggested improvements to this
instruction on Air Force (AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, IAW AFI
11-202V2, Attachment 5.
1.9. Definitions. Find explanations or definitions of terms and abbreviations commonly used in
the aviation community in Code of Federal Regulations Title 14, Part 1; DoD FLIP General
Planning, Chapter 2; and Joint Pub 1-02, The DoD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms.
See Attachment 1 for common terms used herein.
1.10. Aircrew Operational Reports. The reporting requirements in this instruction are exempt
from licensing IAW AFI 33-324, The Information Collections and Reports Management
Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency Air Force Information.

                                COMMAND AND CONTROL

2.1. Operational Control (OPCON). AFSOC is designated as the controlling agency for
United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM)-assigned Air Force SOF aircraft,
while Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs) have OPCON of theater-based assets. In
practice, the Special Operations Wing or Group Commander routinely exercises delegated
responsibility for planning and executing home-station AFSOC missions, off-station training
missions, and missions transiting to/from other Areas of Responsibility (AORs). The Wing or
Group Commander, in turn, normally exercises control of home-station missions through the
command post supporting the wing or group. In the event that assigned forces undergo a Change
in Operational Control (CHOP), responsibility for mission monitoring also passes to the gaining
command. Changeover will be accomplished IAW the pertinent Operational Plan, Operational
Order, or deployment or execution order.
   2.1.1. Unless otherwise specified by OPLAN/CONPLAN, Wing or Group OPCON
   terminates when forces first land in the gaining TSOC/JSOAC AOR; Wings/Groups resume
   OPCON of redeploying forces when those forces first land outside the TSOC/JSOAC AOR.
2.2. Deleted.
2.3. Waiver and Approval Authorities.
   2.3.1. The AFSOC/A3 is designated COMAFSOF for missions operating away from home-
   station, and not under control of another designated COMAFSOF. The AFSOC/A3 holds
   waiver/approval authority for items normally authorized above wing level, and for those
   items identified as COMAFSOF authorities.

                      CREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT

3.1. Aircrew Qualification. Each person assigned as a primary crewmember must be qualified
or in training for qualification in that crew position, mission, and Mission Design Series (MDS)
aircraft.
   3.1.1. Basic proficiency crewmembers may perform primary crew duties on any non-mission
   sortie and on missions (including unilateral training, joint training and exercises) when
   receiving mission qualification training or evaluations under the supervision of a qualified
   instructor or flight examiner in their respective crew position.
   3.1.2. Basic mission capable crewmembers may perform primary crew duties on any
   unilateral training mission. For other missions, the unit commander must determine the
   readiness of each basic mission capable crewmember to perform primary crew duties.
   3.1.3. Non-current (NC) or Unqualified (UNQ) pilots may perform crew duties only on
   designated training or evaluation missions under the supervision of a qualified instructor or
   flight examiner pilot. Both pilots must be fully qualified unless exempted by AFI 11-401,
   Aviation Management.
   3.1.4. Other NC or UNQ crewmembers may perform duties in their primary crew position
   on any mission when under direct supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner in
   their respective crew position. In this case, the student crewmember and the instructor or
   flight examiner fulfills the requirement for one primary position as specified in Table 3.1.
   NOTE: Dual qualified instructor navigator/fire control officers may perform crew duties in
   one seat while instructing a NC, not an UNQ navigator or fire control officer in the other
   seat.         NOTE: Instructor sensor operators may perform crew duties in one seat while
   instructing a NC, not a UNQ sensor operator in the other seat.
   3.1.5. For the purpose of aircraft/mission familiarization, the Group Commander, or
   COMAFSOF may authorize unqualified personnel to perform duties in non-pilot crew
   positions during flight under direct instructor/flight examiner supervision. The purpose of
   this familiarization training is to enhance crew esprit and to enable the individual to gain a
   better understanding of the crew concept. This training will only be conducted in permissive
   environments, and only when mission accomplishment is not impacted. Comply with AFI
   11-401, Aviation Management.
   3.1.6. Unqualified personnel attending the SOF Weapons Instructor Course (WIC), may
   perform duties during non-critical phases of flight in all crew positions on WIC syllabus-
   approved training sorties when under the direct supervision of an MDS-qualified WIC
   instructor in that crew position.
3.2. Crew Complement. Minimum crew complement will be as specified in the flight manual
and Table 3.1. The group commander or COMAFSOF is the waiver authority for all other crew
positions above the minimum specified by the flight manual.

   3.7.1. When taking oral or injected medication, unless an individual medical waiver has been
   granted by HQ AFSOC/SG. Mild analgesics such as aspirin and aspirin substitute may be
   used without prescription when the underlying illness is not cause for grounding. Dexedrine
   or similar stimulant pep pills will not be used unless authorized by HQ AFSOC/SG.
3.8. Alert Procedures. Refer to AFI 11-202V3 AFSOC SUP 1 Chapter 9, for alert procedures.
3.9. AFSOC Alert Aircraft. Maintain aircraft on alert status IAW the following:
   3.9.1. Park the aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and takeoff.
   3.9.2. Whenever operationally feasible, have a crew other than the alert crew preflight the
   alert aircraft. It is the intent of this procedure to allow the alert period and aircraft preflight
   validity period to be aligned. This should prevent the need to update the preflight during the
   alert period.
   3.9.3. The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided
   the following conditions are met:
       3.9.3.1. Alert requirements can be met with sufficient fuel to meet mission requirements.
       3.9.3.2. Communication contact is maintained with the primary controlling agency.
       3.9.3.3. Controlling agencies are notified any time the alert aircraft departs the local area.
       3.9.3.4. If maintenance actions are not required, the aircraft can be resealed for alert once
       the through flight inspection is completed. A new flight crew preflight is not required
       until the end (72 hours) of the initial preflight period.
   3.9.4. A DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-Tactical, will be prepared
   for the alert aircraft. Alert crews are authorized to prepare an AF Form 4064 card using the
   worst weather conditions expected for the alert period. Use the data for alert scrambles. If
   the alert aircraft is flown for other reasons, use AF Form 4064 for the existing weather
   conditions.
   3.9.5. When preflighted alert aircraft changes or an alert crew change occurs and the same
   aircraft remains on alert, the oncoming crew will, as a minimum, apply power to the aircraft
   and check applicable items listed below:
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                    25


     3.9.5.1. Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781, AFORM Aircrew/Mission Flight
     Data Document.
     3.9.5.2. Interior and exterior for proper configuration and special equipment.
     3.9.5.3. Fuel quantity.
     3.9.5.4. Survival and emergency equipment.
     3.9.5.5. Navigation and communication equipment.
     3.9.5.6. Liquid oxygen quantity (if applicable).
     3.9.5.7. Hydraulic reservoirs, gearboxes (if applicable) and accumulator charges.
     3.9.5.8. Publications.
  3.9.6. Should the aircraft remain on alert for more than 72 hours, a complete aircrew
  preflight is then required.
  3.9.7. Once the aircraft is accepted for alert, the flight engineer will ensure an entry is made
  in the AFTO Form 781 stating as a minimum the date and time the aircraft was preflighted.
  3.9.8. Consider alert aircraft off-limits to all personnel except alert crewmembers. No
  maintenance may be performed on the aircraft without approval of the unit/mission
  commander. Upon being told to launch, the crew is required to check the area in which
  maintenance was performed, prior to flight.

                                            Chapter 4

                          AIRCRAFT OPERATING GUIDELINES

4.1. Objectives. A fully mission capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the logistics effort.
The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the PIC. If one
crew accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this
acceptance does not commit that crew, or a different crew, to accept subsequent operations with
the same item or system inoperative. When the PIC considers an item essential, designate the
component mission essential (ME) on the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and
Work Document, and the item will be repaired or replaced prior to departure.
4.2. Policy. This chapter provides guidance on how to operate with degraded equipment. If the
PIC elects to operate with degraded equipment or aircraft systems, coordinate mission
requirements (i.e., revised departure times, fuel requirements, maintenance requirements, etc.)
prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact
follow-on missions.
4.3. Aircraft Operating Guidelines:
   4.3.1. Pressurization and Air Conditioning Systems:           Pressurization and both air
   conditioning systems should be operational. If a system fails at an en route stop, the mission
   may continue to a destination with repair capability. Required en route stops are authorized.
   The aircrew will comply with aircraft flight manual avionics cooling requirements.
   4.3.2. Electrical System: All engine Alternating Current (AC) generators will be operational
   prior to departure. If a generator fails at an en route stop, the mission may continue to a
   destination with repair capability. Required en route stops are authorized. If the aircraft is
   equipped with a failed bearing indicating system, the generator may be turned off and
   monitored in lieu of disconnecting the generator.
   4.3.3. An operative Air Turbine Motor or Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) generator is required
   for unrestricted flight. If the system is inoperative, flight in daylight Visual Meteorological
   Conditions (VMC) within 100 nm of a suitable airfield is permissible provided no other
   electrical malfunction exists. An inoperative APU generator will be removed and padded
   prior to operating the APU.
   4.3.4. Fuel System: The primary concern with inoperative fuel boost pumps or quantity
   indicators is fuel balance and wing loading. Degraded operation is permissible; however,
   flight crews must consider potentially trapped fuel and decreased range should further
   degradation occur. The following paragraphs provide guidelines for degraded fuel system
   operations under most circumstances.
       4.3.4.1. One pump must be operable for each external tank containing fuel.
       4.3.4.2. One main tank fuel indicator may be inoperative. Two main tank indicators may
       be inoperative provided they are not symmetrical tanks or on the same wing.
           4.3.4.2.1. The tank with the inoperative indicator and its symmetrical tank quantity
           will be verified by use of a fuel tank dip stick.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                      27


        4.3.4.2.2. At en route stops when engines are shut down, dip check the tank with the
        inoperative indicator and the symmetrically opposite tank.
        4.3.4.2.3. Begin crossfeed operation when the symmetrically opposite quantity
        indicator has decreased to 1,500 pounds (inboards) and 2,500 pounds (outboards).
        4.3.4.2.4. Engine out training using the engine corresponding to the inoperative
        indicator or it’s symmetrically opposite will not be conducted during tank to engine
        operation.
        4.3.4.2.5. Maintain symmetrical engine fuel flow.
        4.3.4.2.6. Plan to terminate flights with a minimum of 8,000 pounds calculated main
        tank fuel.
     4.3.4.3. One external fuel tank indicator may be inoperative provided both external fuel
     tanks are checked full or empty. Both external fuel tank indicators may be inoperative
     provided both external tanks are checked empty. When an external tank indicator is
     inoperative and the tank cannot be visually checked empty due to foam modification,
     comply with the following prior to flight:
        4.3.4.3.1. Check pressure with each pump in the external tank. If no pressure is
        obtained, the tank is verified empty.
        4.3.4.3.2. If pressure is obtained, ground-transfer the fuel from the external tank.
        Defuel the external tank if unable to ground transfer.
        4.3.4.3.3. When unable to verify an external tank is empty prior to engine start, place
        the tank on cross feed until no pressure is obtained. This will be completed prior to
        takeoff.
     4.3.4.4. Both auxiliary tank indicators may be inoperative provided auxiliary fuel
     quantity is verified by the tank sight gauge.
     4.3.4.5. Both a main and external fuel tank indicator may be inoperative on the same
     wing provided steps in paragraphs 4.3.4.2. and 4.3.4.3. are followed.
     4.3.4.6. For other than normal ground refueling/defueling operations and associated
     guidelines in this chapter, fuel will not be transferred into or out of a main or external fuel
     tank with an inoperative indicator or its symmetrical tank except the following:
        4.3.4.6.1. Fuel transfer into a main or external tank with an inoperative indicator may
        be accomplished during contingency or emergency fuel need situations. All transfers,
        under these conditions, will be coordinated verbally and visually with the pilot/copilot
        as a backup for lateral wing balance. Compliance with paragraphs 4.3.4.2., 4.3.4.3
        and sub-paragraphs still apply.
            4.3.4.6.1.1. A reliable source of known quantity transferred must be available.
            This source can be either the internal aircraft operating fuel quantity indicators,
            the Tanker’s Air Refueling System, or the fuel truck.
            4.3.4.6.1.2. Maintain symmetrical tanks within 1,000 pounds at all times. Initiate
            fuel transfer by opening only the refuel valve corresponding to the inoperative
            fuel quantity indicator. Verify fuel is being transferred into the tank, and then
28                                                          AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


            open the remaining refuel valves. When the symmetrical tank reaches the desired
            fuel level, close both refuel valves while verifying a pressure increase on the fuel
            pressure transmitter. Close the other refuel valves as appropriate. NOTE: To
            avoid an inadvertent pressure disconnect, coordinate with the tanker to use only
            one fuel transfer pump until all receiver refuel valves are open. NOTE: If the
            refuel valve corresponding to the inoperative fuel quantity indicator loses power
            during fuel transfer, the only indication will be an increase in the manifold fuel
            pressure. If this occurs, fuel transfer will be terminated until the failed refuel
            valve is identified and the other power source is selected.
         4.3.4.6.2. DELETED
         4.3.4.6.3. DELETED
  4.3.5. Anti-skid System: The anti-skid may be inoperative for flight to a destination with
  repair capability. Required en route stops are authorized.
     4.3.5.1. A local training flight may continue once airborne if the anti-skid fails provided
     the system is turned off. The mission is restricted to one termination landing.
  4.3.6. Landing Gear System: If a landing gear or position indicating system malfunction is
  encountered, only a full stop landing will be made. Gear will not be moved from the down
  and locked position. The discrepancy will be corrected prior to the next flight.
  EXCEPTION: If repair capability does not exist and a positive determination is made that
  further flight can be accomplished with the gear down and locked, the Group Commander or
  COMAFSOF may authorize flight to a destination where repair capability exists provided the
  gear is not moved from the down and locked position. Required en route stops are
  authorized. If proper coordination is not feasible, the PIC will inform the appropriate
  authority when circumstances permit.
  4.3.7. Doors and Ramp System: Aircraft will not depart on a pressurized flight unless the
  door warning light system for the cargo ramp is operative.
     4.3.7.1. Aircraft will not be flown with a crew entrance door or crew entrance door
     warning light malfunction.
     4.3.7.2. Aircraft will not be flown pressurized with a cargo ramp lock malfunction.
     Unpressurized flight is authorized with a cargo ramp lock malfunction only when mission
     requirements dictate.
  4.3.8. Navigations Systems: Comply with FLIP series publications for required navigational
  systems while operating in the Minimum Navigation Performance System (MNPS).
     4.3.8.1. For flights in MNPS airspace and below in the North Atlantic Region or the
     Composite Hawaii/Mainland Route System, the following minimum operable navigation
     systems are mandatory: NOTE: ATC uses the same reporting and investigating criteria
     for gross navigational errors that occur below as well as within MNPS airspace.
         4.3.8.1.1. Two independent sources of drift and ground speed, i.e., Doppler and
         inertial navigation system (INS), Doppler and global positioning system (GPS), INS
         and GPS, or dual INS.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                      29


         4.3.8.1.2. Two independent sources of heading, i.e., one C-12 compass system and
         one aligned inertial system. The C-130 standby compass is not considered a separate
         source for the purposes of this paragraph.
     4.3.8.2. For flights on all other Category I routes, the following minimum operable
     navigation systems are mandatory:
         4.3.8.2.1. Doppler (except for AC-130U), INS, or GPS.
         4.3.8.2.2. Two independent sources of heading, i.e., one C-12 compass system and
         one aligned inertial system. The C-130 standby compass is not considered a separate
         source for the purposes of this paragraph.
     4.3.8.3. For all other flights on Category II routes, or tactical missions, the PIC will
     decide what the minimum navigation requirements are to safely execute the mission.
  4.3.9. Radar: Radar Weather Mode Inoperative: Crews shall not fly in Instrument
  Meteorological Conditions (IMC) in the vicinity of forecast or actual thunderstorms without
  operable on-board weather radar. Crews will maintain positive communications with and
  obtain weather updates from Command Post (or applicable Command & Control agency) and
  the local weather updating agency (typically METRO). Crews may use radio relays through
  other aircraft for this information so long as positive communications with the other aircraft
  are maintained. In either case, if communications are lost, crews will reposition the aircraft
  to re-establish communications or land.
  4.3.10. Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS): The GCAS will be operational for all
  departures unless parts are not available on station to repair the unit. For failure after
  departure, flight may continue to a destination with repair capability. Required en route stops
  are authorized.
  4.3.11. Enhanced-Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (ETCAS). The ETCAS (if
  equipped) will be operational for all non-contingency departures unless parts are not
  available on station to repair the unit. For failure after departure, flight may continue to a
  destination with repair capability. Required en route stops are authorized. Comply with host
  nation requirements.
  4.3.12. Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). The CVR will be operational for all departures
  unless parts are not available on station to repair the unit. For failure after departure, flight
  may continue to a destination with repair capability. Required en route stops are authorized.
  4.3.13. Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR). The DFDR (if equipped) will be operational
  for all departures unless parts are not available on station to repair the unit. For failure after
  departure, flight may continue to a destination with repair capability. Required enroute stops
  are authorized.
  4.3.14. AC-130 Operational Flight Program (OFP). OFP reload is primarily a maintenance
  function. Authorized crews may use tested procedures to do in-flight OFP reload if
  necessary to safely recover the aircraft and/or prevent loss of life.
  4.3.15. Aircraft will not depart with an inoperative Identification Friend or Foe
  (IFF)/Selective Identification Feature (SIF) without the approval of ATC and the PIC.
  EXCEPTION: Formations must have at least one operational IFF/SIF per element.
30                                                       AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010

                                   AIRLAND OPERATIONS

5.1. Aircraft Maximum Gross Weight Policy. Aircraft maximum gross weight is 155,000
pounds. Waiver authority for operations up to 165,000 pounds is Operations Group Commander
or COMAFSOF/Commander Air Force Forces for AFSOC C-130 operations within their AOR.
Waiver authority for operations above 165,000 pounds is HQ AFSOC/A3. The maximum
waiverable gross weight is 175,000 pounds. Operations above 155,000 pounds require an AFTO
Form 781A entry with the actual gross weight at which the aircraft was operated. Operations
above 155,000 pounds, although structurally possible, are not advisable for routine operations
and should be limited due to the increased airframe fatigue and maintenance costs incurred.
When operating aircraft at gross weights in excess of 155,000 pounds use primary fuel
management and check the limit flight speed versus altitude chart in Section 5 of the flight
manual. Aircraft will not be operated in such a manner to exceed flight manual or performance
manual limitations during ground or flight operations. Preflight Operational Risk Management
(ORM) will focus on takeoff conditions/obstacles and extreme diligence will be used when
computing Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD). Climb out factor and 3-engine climb
performance will be incorporated into TOLD cross-check. Tactical or low-level operations
above 155,000 pounds for non-contingency missions are not authorized. Aircraft will land at or
below 155,000 pounds.
5.2. Checklists.
   5.2.1. The Pilot Flying (PF) the aircraft will initiate all checklists unless the flight manual or
   this instruction establishes another procedure.
   5.2.2. Carry abbreviated checklists. The only pages (or inserts) authorized in approved
   checklists are C-130 series Technical Order (T.O.) aircrew checklists, AFSOC approved
   checklists and briefing guides, and OG/OGV approved information guides. Units may
   construct locally approved in-flight guides using AF Form 4124, AFSOC Flight Crew
   Information Guide and will provide a copy to OG/OGV for approval.
   5.2.3. If making personal notes on checklists, briefings, or information guides they must be
   current .
   5.2.4. Abbreviated checklist items that do not apply to unit aircraft or mission may be lined
   out. Do not challenge these items during checklist accomplishment.
5.3. Duty Station. Both pilots shall be in their seats during flight. One of the pilots may be out
of their seat for brief periods to meet physiological needs. With both pilots in their seats, the PIC
may authorize rest periods for one pilot occupying a primary duty station during non-critical
phases of flight. Comply with Controlled Cockpit Rest guidance in AFI 11-202V3. Only one
pilot, or the flight engineer (FE), may be absent from their duty station at a time. All aircrew
members will notify the PIC prior to departing assigned primary duty station.
5.4. Flight Deck Entry.
   5.4.1. The following personnel are authorized on the flight deck during takeoff, landing, and
   critical phases of flight. They must be in compliance with paragraph 5.9.2

      flight examiners).
      5.4.1.2. Individuals approved by the group commander or COMAFSOF.
   5.4.2. The PIC may authorize passengers to visit the flight deck during non-critical phases of
   flight. Refer to paragraph 3.1.5 for unqualified personnel access restrictions to any primary
   crew station.
5.5. Takeoff and Landing Policy.
   5.5.1. The PIC will occupy either the left or right seat during all takeoffs and landings.
   5.5.2. A qualified Instructor Pilot (IP) or Evaluator Pilot (EP) may takeoff or land from
   either seat under any condition.
   5.5.3. A qualified Mission Pilot (MP) or First Pilot (FP) may takeoff and land from either
   seat. Comply with paragraph 5.6.
   5.5.4. A qualified MP/FP will land from the left seat during aircraft emergencies, unless
   conditions prevent compliance.
   5.5.5. Pilots in IP upgrade training may take off and land from the right seat under the
   supervision of an IP or EP when an unqualified pilot occupies the other seat.
   5.5.6. A qualified MP will takeoff/land from the left seat under the following conditions:
      5.5.6.1. During formation departures and recoveries. Evaluators, instructors and
      instructor upgrade students may land from the right seat for training, currency, or
      proficiency.
      5.5.6.2. During maximum effort or substandard airfield operations. Evaluators,
      instructors and instructor upgrade students may land from the right seat for training,
      currency, or proficiency.
      5.5.6.3. During missions operating in hostile airspace (IAW AFI 11-401) or in areas of
      hostile activity (ORM assessment of High). For units operating in defined combat zones,
      AFSOC/A3 or designated COMAFSOF may authorize takeoffs and landings from the
      right seat at specific airfields with the following restrictions:
          5.5.6.3.1. PICs must have accomplished 5 takeoffs and landings at the airfield before
          allowing their copilots to takeoff or land.
          5.5.6.3.2. Copilots must have observed 5 takeoffs and landings at the airfield before
          they are authorized to takeoff or land.
      5.5.6.4. At airfields that require any waiver approval.         EXCEPTION:         Non-DoD
      approach waivers.
      5.5.6.5. At certification airfields specified in the HQ AMC Airfield Suitability and
      Restrictions Report (ASRR).
      5.5.6.6. For all Night Vision Goggle (NVG) Airland operations. EXCEPTION: Current
      and qualified MPs/Mission Copilot (MC)s may accomplish NVG landings (non-
      shortfield/non-maximum effort) from the right seat provided that the left seat pilot is
      NVG Airland current and qualified.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                     33


   5.5.7. PICs who possess less than 100 hours in command in any C-130 aircraft since initial
   upgrade will make all takeoffs and landings when the right seat is occupied by a First Copilot
   (FC) or FP.
5.6. Copilot Landing Policy. Except as specified above, and provided no distinguished visitor
(DV) four or higher are on board, copilots may takeoff or land:
   5.6.1. From either seat if an instructor or flight examiner occupies the other seat.
   5.6.2. From the right seat if an FP or above occupies the left seat. Comply with paragraph
   5.5.7.

5.7. Landing Gear and Flap Operation In-flight.
   5.7.1. The landing gear will be operated by the pilot in the right seat. Actuate the landing
   gear only after command of the pilot flying the aircraft. Prior to actuation of the landing
   gear, the other pilot will acknowledge the command by repeating it.
   5.7.2. Operate the flaps only after the command of the PF. Prior to operating the flaps,
   acknowledge the PFs command by repeating it. The PIC may assign flap operation to either
   the pilot monitoring (PM) or the flight engineer.
5.8. Use of Outside Observers: Use crewmembers to assist in outside watch during all taxi
operations and in flight during arrivals and departures.
5.9. Seat Belts:
   5.9.1. Crewmembers occupying either the pilot, copilot, or flight engineer seat will have seat
   belts fastened at all times.
   5.9.2. All occupants will be seated with seat belts fastened during taxi, takeoffs and landings.
   EXCEPTION:          Flight examiners, instructors, mission commanders, crewmembers
   performing scanner duties, flight engineers, aerial gunners, and loadmasters performing
   required duties during taxi, takeoffs and landing; however, they will have a designated seat
   and required restraint available.
5.10. Aircraft Lighting:
   5.10.1. Use taxi lights during all taxi operations. Use wingtip taxi lights during night taxi
   operations (except AC-130H). Use landing lights at night in unlighted areas. Use the
   landing and taxi lights during all takeoffs and landings. Use taxi lights in flight any time the
   landing gear is extended unless reflections cause pilot distractions in instrument conditions.
   5.10.2. Use anti-collision lights or strobe lights from takeoff to landing on all flights. The
   PIC may turn off anti-collision lights when it is in the best interest of safety to do so.
   Aircraft with both anti-collision lights and strobe lights inoperative may continue to a base
   where repairs can be made.

   be used in accordance with AFI 11-202V3, chapter 5. NOTE: Formations may vary lighting
   as necessary provided adequate visual identification of the formation is maintained.
   5.10.4. Contingency operations may dictate that external lights are off and internal lights are
   limited to the minimum necessary for aircrew activities.
5.11. Advisory/Required Calls.
   5.11.1. The PF will periodically announce intentions during departures, arrivals, approaches,
   and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. Table 5.1. through Table
   5.5. depict mandatory calls for non-precision approaches, precision approaches, climbout and
   descent, respectively.

 approach fix, or holding altitude
 NOTES:
 1. Prior to Refusal Speed, any crewmember noting a safety of flight condition/malfunction
 will state “Reject” and give a brief description of the malfunction.

 2. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land or go-around. If the runway
 environment is not in sight and/or the aircraft is not in position to execute a safe landing, a go
 around will be made.

 3. With weather at CAT 1 minimums on a CAT 1 ILS, the pilot may only see the initial
 portion of the approach light system. The pilot may continue to 100 Height Above
 Touchdown (HAT) with reference to the approach light system but may not descend below
 100 feet above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference unless the red
 terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable.

 4. The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue, or go-around. Respond
 intention to “Land” if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight throughout
 touchdown and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing.

   5.11.2. Deviations:
       5.11.2.1. The PM will inform the PF when heading or airspeed deviations are observed,
       or when the altitude is more than 100 feet from the desired, and no attempt is being made
       to correct the deviation.
       5.11.2.2. Any crewmember seeing a deviation of 200 feet altitude or 10 knots in
       airspeed, or a potential terrain or obstruction problem, will immediately notify the PF.
       Deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be
       announced.
   5.11.3. Runway Environment. The runway environment consists of one or more of the
   following elements:
       5.11.3.1. The approach light system (except that the PF my not descent below 100 feet
       above the Touchdown Zone Elevation (TDZE) using the approach lights as a reference
       unless the red termination bars or the red side row bars are also visible and identifiable).
 36                                                           AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


      5.11.3.2. The threshold, threshold markings, or threshold lights.
      5.11.3.3. The Runway End Identified Lights.
      5.11.3.4. The touchdown zone, touchdown zone markings, or touchdown zone lights.
      5.11.3.5. The runway, runway markings, or runway lights.
      5.11.3.6. The Visual Approach Slope Indicator.
5.12. Communications Policy:
   5.12.1. Aircraft Interphone:
      5.12.1.1. All crewmembers will monitor interphone. Crewmembers will notify the pilot
      before going off headset and advise when back on headset.
      5.12.1.2. Do not discuss classified information on the interphone during radio
      transmissions.
      5.12.1.3. Classified interphone or radio transmissions will be recorded on the cockpit
      voice recorder if it is operating. Ensure the CVR remains on and running until the tape is
      clear of any recorded classified conversations.
      5.12.1.4. Non-aircrew members may monitor interphone or radio transmissions only
      when specifically approved by the PIC. The PIC will brief communications policy to
      these personnel prior to flight. The PIC must ensure no one monitors classified
      information for which they are not cleared or transmits classified information over the
      radios.
      5.12.1.5. Sterile Cockpit. Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and
      mission accomplishment during checklists, taxi, takeoff, approach, landing, and any other
      critical phase of flight.
   5.12.2. Command Radios:
      5.12.2.1. The pilot not flying the aircraft normally makes all radio calls.
      5.12.2.2. All crewmembers will monitor the primary radio unless specifically directed to
      do otherwise by the PIC or subsequent chapters of this instruction. The PIC will
      designate crewmembers required to monitor the HF and or SATCOM radio.
      5.12.2.3. The pilot operating command radios will tell the crew which radio is primary.
      5.12.2.4. Pilots are responsible for ensuring emergency frequencies are monitored at all
      times.
      5.12.2.5. During emergencies, request simultaneous Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) and
      Very-High Frequency (VHF) transmissions when operating in a terminal area under radar
      control.
      5.12.2.6. One of the pilots will record and read back all ATC clearances. The navigator
      will record the clearance and monitor the read back including all transmissions pertaining
      to ATC instructions involving departure, en route, and approach procedures. Disregard
      this procedure when such action interferes with timely completion of more important
      duties.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                    37


5.13. Pilot Proficiency with Munitions.
   5.13.1. AC-130s may do pilot proficiency events at joint-use or military fields with
   munitions on board provided a letter of agreement between the OG/OGV or /COMAFSOF
   and airfield manager is on file. A list of approved airfields will be published in local area
   procedures.
       5.13.1.1. If an emergency situation requires the gunship to full stop at the airfield, the
       PIC will ensure the aircraft is parked IAW Chapter 18, Table 18.1
5.14. Wind Limitations. Maximum crosswind limits are in accordance with flight manual
limitations. Remain within the “recommended” or “caution” areas of the crosswind charts for
normal takeoffs and landings. Simulated engine out landings (one or two engine inoperative)
must fall within the “Recommended” area unless otherwise approved by the Group Commander,
or COMAFSOF (for contingency operations).
5.15. Runway Condition Reading (RCR) and Runway Surface Condition (RSC): The
performance charts used to determine braking action are based on concrete runways. The
runway surface should be considered wet when water on the runway causes a reflective glare.
The RCR values for the following runway surfaces in Table 5.6. are estimates based on
operational experience and should be used only as a guide.

Table 5.6. RCR Values.

   5.15.1. Limit AC-130 operations into and out of slush or water covered runways to a
   covering of one inch. This number is based on performance charts where an RSC of 10 is
   equal to one inch of slush or water. Performance data where more than one inch of slush or
   water is present may not be accurate.
5.16. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Pilots must ensure wake turbulence avoidance criteria are
met during flight operations. Acceptance of a visual or contact approach clearance, or
instructions to follow an aircraft, is acknowledgment that the pilot will maintain a safe interval
for wake turbulence avoidance. Adhere to aircraft wake turbulence avoidance and separation
criteria contained in Department of Defense (DoD) FLIP planning (General Planning Chapter 5).
5.17. Runway and Taxiway Requirements. Use normal takeoff and landing procedures
whenever practical. For mission accomplishment, if approach end overruns are available and
stressed or authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available
for takeoff. All speeds and distances will be computed “without nose wheel steering.” For
mission accomplishment the PIC may authorize “with nose wheel steering” corrections on dry
hard surfaced runways in lieu of downloading cargo/fuel. Use of non-hard surfaced runways or
taxiways requires group commander, or COMAFSOF approval.

   5.17.1. Normal Operations:
      5.17.1.1. Takeoff. Minimum runway length is critical field length.
      5.17.1.2. Landing.    Minimum runway length is landing distance plus the following
      correction factors:
          5.17.1.2.1. Runway Visual Range (RVR) less than 40 (3/4 mile)--add 1,000 feet
          5.17.1.2.2. RVR equal to or greater than 40 (3/4 mile)--add 500 feet.
      5.17.1.3. Minimum runway width is 60 feet or 19 meters.
      5.17.1.4. Minimum taxiway width is 30 feet or 9 meters.
      5.17.1.5. NVG Operations: Minimum runway length for landing is landing distance plus
      1,000 feet.
5.18. Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria.
   5.18.1. Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers
   monitoring the clearance between aircraft and obstructions. With wing walkers, avoid taxi
   obstructions by at least 10 feet. EXCEPTION: IAW AFI 11-218, aircraft may taxi without
   marshallers/wing walkers at home station along fixed taxi lines which have been measured to
   ensure a minimum of 10 feet clearance from any obstruction and the obstruction is
   permanent. Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) and vehicles are considered a permanent
   obstruction provided it is parked entirely within a designated area. Areas will be designated
   by permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines on the ramp or another suitable means.
   Adjacent aircraft are also considered a permanent obstruction, provided the aircraft is parked
   properly in its designated spot and is not moving.
   5.18.2. When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers. If wing walkers are
   not available, the PIC will deplane one or more crewmembers to maintain obstruction
   clearance and provide marshaling using AFI 11-218 signals. Use wing walkers, deplaned
   crewmembers, or a crewmember on interphone positioned at the paratroop door(s) to act as
   an observer while maneuvering on narrow taxiways. During night taxi operations,
   marshallers will have an illuminated wand in each hand. Wing walkers are only required to
   have one illuminated wand. Observers should be in a position to see wing walkers at all
   times (through door or windows) and communicate with the pilot.
   5.18.3. Use low speed ground idle when practical. If Foreign Object Damage (FOD) is a
   problem, the outboard engines may be shut down provided gross weight, taxiway, and
   weather are favorable. Verify all sources of brake pressure before shutting down
   symmetrical engines.
   5.18.4. After landing and clearing the runway, with approval of the pilot, the loadmaster may
   open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to 12 inches above horizontal, to prepare for
   ammo offload or onload provided all equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secured in the
   cargo compartment/gun deck.
   5.18.5. Figure 5.1 provides obstruction clearance criteria for ground operations at airfields
   with fixed obstructions or terrain (i.e., fire hydrants, fuel pits, uneven surfaces). It depicts
   maximum obstacle or terrain heights at specified distances to ensure clearance with the main
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                    39


   landing gear on the edge of the operating surface. PICs will be advised of any known
   obstructions that exceed the shaded areas.
5.19. Reverse Taxi. Use extreme caution while backing the aircraft due to inherent hazards.
   5.19.1. The pilot will coordinate engine status/utilization with the flight engineer, and taxi
   directions and signals to be used with the loadmaster and marshaller prior to commencing
   reverse taxi operations.
   5.19.2. Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated.
   5.19.3. Open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12 inches above
   horizontal.
   5.19.4. The loadmaster will be on the ramp in position to direct reverse taxi, report any
   hazards, and provide the pilot with timely interphone instructions on turns, distance
   remaining, condition of the maneuvering area, and stopping point.
   5.19.5. During night reverse taxi operations, the pilot and loadmaster will ensure that
   visibility in the taxi area is sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations. The loading lights,
   retracted landing lights, NVGs, or any other source that provides adequate lighting of the taxi
   area may be used.
   5.19.6. Stop no less than 25 feet from an obstruction even if using a wing walker.
   5.19.7. The flight engineer will monitor engine instruments and overheat detection/warning
   systems for all engines.
   5.19.8. The copilot will monitor outside the aircraft and backup the flight engineer on engine
   instruments.
5.20. Buddy and Windmill Taxi Starts. Buddy and windmill taxi starts must be approved by
the group commander or COMAFSOF. Group commanders may delegate this authority to their
squadron or mission commander when the unit is deployed. This authorization will not be
construed to allow repeated buddy or windmill starts at various scheduled en route stops. Load
all remaining crewmembers after completion of the windmill taxi start IAW applicable flight
manual.
5.21. Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Criteria.
   5.21.1. The mission directive is confirmation that AFSOC/CC, or COMASOF with area
   jurisdiction, has reviewed the airfields of intended operation for obstructions and other
   hazards IAW Air Force and AFSOC directives. The group commander or COMAFSOF will
   advise crews of known obstructions and other factors that could be hazardous to airland
   operations. PICs will not make an approach and landing into an airfield requiring
   certification by the ASRR unless they have previously operated into that airfield as a pilot,
   copilot, or observer and have reviewed the airfield certification briefing and audiovisual
   program within the last 14 days.
   5.21.2. An airfield is considered suitable for C-130 operations when:
       5.21.2.1. The airfield is listed as suitable in the HQ AMC/DOAS ASRR. Comply with
       ASRR guidance in AFI 11-202V3, AFSOCSUP1, Chapter 2.
 40                                                        AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


      5.21.2.2. No obstructions or rising terrain exceed the shaded areas of Figure 5.2 This
      ensures clearance only if the aircraft is maintained within 35 feet of runway centerline
      and a bank of five degrees is not exceeded.
      5.21.2.3. When an obstruction or terrain exceeds the shaded areas of Figure 5.2, specific
      approval by the group commander, or COMAFSOF is required and the PIC must be
      advised of the height and location of the obstructions as well as specific procedures to
      avoid the obstruction (e.g., landing beyond obstacles).

Figure 5.2. Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria.




5.22. Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the approved
usable portion of the runway. The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the
PIC. Base TOLD card computations on runway remaining from the point the takeoff is initiated.
5.23. Reduced Power Operations. Reduced power operations are intended to prolong engine
service life and should be used any time maximum power is not required.
   5.23.1. During proficiency air work (flights or operations that are mainly confined to any
   local traffic pattern), when reduced power is used, Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) will not
   be less than 1010º Celsius (C) for takeoff, not to exceed 19,600 inch-pounds of torque.
   5.23.2. Reduced power for formation takeoffs to a torque corresponding to no less than
   1010º C TIT for takeoff. Lead will reduce power to 970º C TIT once climb speed is
   obtained.
   5.23.3. Climb power to cruise altitude will be 1010º C TIT, not to exceed 19,600 inch-
   pounds of torque, unless mission requirements dictate otherwise.
5.24. Three-Engine Takeoffs. Actual engine-out takeoffs require HQ AFSOC/A3 waiver.
5.25. Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces. Aircrews should not normally attempt to
recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto soft, unprepared surfaces not suitable for taxi.
Ground crews using the appropriate equipment will accomplish aircraft recovery. Aircrews may
accomplish recovery at austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the PIC is sure there is no
damage and the surface will support the aircraft. If there is damage or if there is any doubt that
the surface will support the aircraft, aircrews will not attempt recovery.
5.26. Engines Running Onload or Offload (ERO) AC-130H/U. For C-130H, crews will refer
to guidance published in AFI 11-2MC-130 Volume 3. Do not use ERO procedures when
explosive cargo is involved unless authorized by the Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training
(JA/ATT) exercise operation order or contingency ATO.

  5.26.1. The ERO procedures in this paragraph may be used for any mix of personnel or
  cargo. The aft cargo door and ramp is preferred when more than 10 passengers are involved.
  The PIC will assess prevailing weather, lighting, and parking location to ensure a safe
  operation.
  5.26.2. General Procedures:
     5.26.2.1. The PIC will brief crewmembers on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing
     specific crewmember duties.
     5.26.2.2. The parking brake will be set and one pilot will monitor brakes, interphone, and
     radio.
     5.26.2.3. Operate engines in ground idle (low speed, if applicable). If conditions
     warrant, open air deflector door and lower flaps to reduce prop or jet blast aft of the
     aircraft.
     5.26.2.4. Turn wing leading edge lights on during night ERO. Taxi lights may be used at
     the discretion of the PIC.
     5.26.2.5. Resume taxi after the door warning light is out and when the LM has verbally
     acknowledged that the aircraft is ready for taxiing. CAUTION: Due to hazards involved
     (i.e., prop blast, proximity to engines or props, lack of paratroop door steps), only hand
     transferable items of cargo may be on or offloaded through the paratroop doors during
     EROs.
     5.26.2.6. Do not onload or offload through the crew entrance door and ramp, or
     paratroop door at the same time.
  5.26.3. Personnel onload and offload through the crew entrance door (except AC-130H).
     5.26.3.1. During enplaning and deplaning, station a crewmember (normally the LM) on
     interphone (cord held taut) approximately 25 feet and at a 45-degree angle from the
     aircraft axis.
     5.26.3.2. Brief deplaning personnel to remain forward of the interphone cord.
     5.26.3.3. The PIC will give clearance to open the crew entrance door.
  5.26.4. AC-130H personnel onload and offload through the right paratroop door.
     5.26.4.1. Brief deplaning personnel to remain aft of the interphone cord.
  5.26.5. Personnel or cargo onload and offload through the aft cargo door and ramp.
     5.26.5.1. After clearance from the pilot, open the aft cargo door, and lower the ramp as
     required.
     5.26.5.2. The loadmaster will direct all onload and offload operations. Passengers will
     be escorted by a crewmember when enplaning or deplaning. Deplane passengers before
     cargo and enplane passengers after cargo unless cargo size or location dictates otherwise.
  5.26.6. ERO for crew changes during local training missions is authorized provided the
  enplaning crew does not approach the aircraft until the deplaning loadmaster on headset is in
  position outside the aircraft. Keep ERO for crew changes to the absolute minimum
  necessary to accomplish the mission.

5.27. Arrival. Plan arrival altitudes to minimize the threat. When more than one aircraft is
involved, consider using multiple altitudes and traffic patterns to prevent predictable targeting by
the enemy.
5.28. Traffic Pattern. Fly normal traffic patterns when the environment permits. Hostile
activity or terrain may require significant modifications to normal traffic patterns. Refer to
Chapter 18 for tactical recovery options.

                         GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

Section 6A—Pre-Mission

6.1. Aircrew Uniforms.
   6.1.1. Wear the aircrew uniform as outline in AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance
   of Air Force Personnel, and the appropriate MAJCOM supplement, on all missions, unless
   other attire is authorized (When the USAF Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG) requires civilian
   attire, wear conservatively styled clothing).
   6.1.2. All aircrew members will have flight gloves readily available during all flights and
   will wear them for takeoffs, landings, and when operating in a combat environment.
   6.1.3. Crewmembers will remove rings and scarves before performing aircrew duties.
   6.1.4. Arctic clothing is required when engaged in Arctic or Antarctic operations, or when
   required by local operating procedures.
6.2. Personal and Professional Equipment.
   6.2.1. Passports. Carry passports on missions when required by the FCG.
   6.2.2. Shot Records. Carry shot records on all off-station missions outside the CONUS,
   Alaska, or Hawaii. Aircrew members will ensure they meet immunization requirements for
   the mission.
   6.2.3. Identification Tags. Identification tags will be worn around the neck or carried in a
   flight suit pocket during all flights.
   6.2.4. FOD Hazards. Crewmembers will not wear wigs, hairpieces, rings, ornaments, pins,
   clips, other hair fasteners, or earrings in the aircraft or on the flightline. EXCEPTION:
   Plain elastic hair fasteners or plastic barrettes are allowed, providing they do not interfere
   with the wearing of headsets or helmets, or the donning of oxygen equipment. All devices
   will be accounted for before and after flight.
   6.2.5. Restricted Area Badges. Carry the restricted area badge on all missions (except actual
   combat missions). Display the badge only in designated restricted areas.
   6.2.6. Reflective Belts. A reflective belt or suitable substitute will be worn on the flightline
   during hours of darkness or periods of reduced visibility.
   6.2.7. Tool Kits. A tool kit will be on board for all flights. Individual units will establish
   requirements for tools to be included in these kits and the crewmember responsible for the kit
   (Hostile Environment Repair Kit (HERK) tool kits satisfy this requirement). The lead gunner
   is responsible for taking gun-clearing tools on live fire off-station missions. NOTE: Gun
   clearing tools on live fire off-station missions are not required if AC-130 weapons/Explosive
   Ordnance Disposal (EOD) support is available at the deployed location.
   6.2.8. Hostile Environment Repair Kit. One HERK will be onboard for all OCONUS and
   contingency deployment missions. Units will identify where the HERK will be stored on the
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                      45


   aircraft in the local supplement to this AFI. The flight engineer will ensure the HERK is
   onboard and serviceable (secured) during the aircraft preflight prior to departure.
   6.2.9. Preflight and carry a headset, helmet and oxygen mask, and operable flashlight on all
   flights. When quick-don oxygen masks are installed, they will be preflighted (to include
   communications hook up) if they are used as the primary oxygen source. If the helmet and
   oxygen mask is the primary oxygen source throughout the flight, the quick-don mask is not
   required to be preflighted or hooked up. NOTE: Crewmembers will make available their
   personal helmet and oxygen mask to an aircrew flight equipment (AFE) facility for cleaning,
   maintenance, and communications testing every 30 days.
   6.2.10. Protective Headgear: Wear helmets during contingency and combat missions. The
   PIC may waive this requirement for specific crewmembers when mission requirements
   dictate.
       6.2.10.1. All personnel aft of flight station (FS) 617 (AC-130H) and FS 245 (AC-130U)
       will wear flight helmets while guns are configured for live fire operations.
       EXCEPTION: During training missions, crew members remaining in the booth or right
       scanner compartment while guns are on the line are not required to wear helmets.
           6.2.10.1.1. When conditions require personnel in the cargo compartment to wear the
           flight helmet the chinstrap will be fastened. NOTE: Helmet visors should be
           lowered or eye protection worn by all personnel aft of flight station (FS) 617 when
           any door(s) are required to be open.
   6.2.11. NVGs. All crewmembers required to carry NVGs will preflight them prior to flight
   for missions using NVGs. If available, the PIC will preflight and carry one spare set of
   NVGs. Each crewmember will carry approved spare batteries for their own NVGs.
       6.2.11.1. Pilots will wear NVGs with similar acuity and gain.
6.3. Survival and Protective Equipment. This equipment may include, but is not limited to
the following: flak vest, life preserver unit (LPU), survival vest and kit, parachute and protective
headgear. Each individual on board will fit a parachute and have it readily available prior to all
weapons delivery, combat, and contingency missions. All crewmembers will have individual
survival vests readily available, and should wear them to the maximum extent possible, during
combat and contingency missions. The PIC will determine minimum wear requirements based
on threat assessment, mission, and crew considerations.
6.4. Aircrew Publications Requirements.
   6.4.1. OG/OGVs will determine which crewmembers will carry the publications specified in
   Table 6.1. on all missions. These publications may be in digital or paper format. If in digital
   format, crews will ensure there are redundant e-tools viewing sources (hardware) on-board
   the aircraft. If e-tools viewing hardware is used in flight it must meet the requirements of
   AFI 11-202V3. All electronic media must be of equal or higher quality than paper products.
   Poorly scanned documents/charts do not meet this standard and are unacceptable. Aircrews
   participating in this program will carry all publications pertinent to their airframe rather than
   those only applicable to their crew position. This restriction assures in-flight publications
   access in those cases where hardware failure/data source corruption prevents access at one or
 46                                                         AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


   more crew positions. FLIP may be viewed/utilized in flight via an AFSOC/A3V approved e-
   tools device.

 Flight Crew Information Summary (FCIS)
 Note 1: The EWO will carry the classified section when mission dictates.
   6.4.2. Operations Group Stan/Eval (OG/OGVs) will develop procedures and standards for
   the e-pubs program. At a minimum, procedures will address a data backup plan at the
   OG/OGV level for the master publications file. For this purpose, utilize three separate data
   media storage devices (e.g., CD-ROM, hard drive, and local area network drive). If at all
   feasible, these data sources should be physically separated from each other in the event of
   catastrophic failure (e.g., fire, tornado etc.). Additionally, OG/OGVs will develop a plan to
   obtain the most current publications and aircrew members will update their publications at
   least monthly and prior to performing flight duties. OG/OGVs will also develop a method by
   which read-only publications will be provided to the end-user/aircrew and the timing of and
   process by which supplements to each publication will be posted. This method will also
   include procedures for maintaining electronic and paper publications concurrently, if
   appropriate. Each level (MAJCOM, Group, and Squadron) will be responsible for posting
   their particular supplements to publications; ultimately, the end-user still bears the
   responsibility for properly posted publications in either electronic or paper format. Lastly,
   OG/OGVs will establish procedures for in-flight use focusing on accessibility and reliability
   of information. In this regard, OG/OGVs are encouraged to restrict data source types (e.g.,
   thumb drives, etc.) to ensure hardware capability in all crew positions. OG/OGVs will
   publish additional restrictions as necessary to ensure the e-pubs program does not require a
   greater workload in flight than the current model of paper products. EXCEPTION: Aircrew
   flight manual checklists will remain in paper format.
      6.4.2.1. Electronic copies (CD-ROM, zip disk etc) of unit publications library are
      acceptable for deployments. Ensure all copies are maintained up to date and files not
      offered electronically are to be maintained in paper format. Appropriate equipment to
      view these files must be available.

Section 6B—Pre-Departure

6.5. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF). Review volume I, part A, of the FCIF before all
missions. Crewmembers will certify their FCIF review as approved by Group Stan/Eval (i.e.,
Patriot Excalibur (PEX), AF Form 4121 FCIF Currency Record, Flight authorization, etc.).
   6.5.1. PICs will verify crewmembers have certified FCIF review prior to flight.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                     47


   6.5.2. Crewmembers delinquent in FCIF and joining a mission enroute will receive an FCIF
   update from their primary aircrew member counterpart on that mission. Instructor pilots
   flying with general officers are responsible for briefing appropriate FCIF items.
   6.5.3. Crewmembers that do not have a unit FCIF card (or if PEX is not available) will
   certify FCIF review by entering the last FCIF number and their initials beside their name on
   the file copy of the flight authorization or their ACM orders.
   6.5.4. For PICs flying outside the CONUS, initialing the AF Form 4121 also certifies review
   of the unit classified airfield threat and security evaluation file. If no new material has been
   added to volume I since the last review, complete the date and initials columns and leave the
   FCIF number column blank
6.6. Aircraft Mission Kits. Units will maintain one mission kit per aircraft. The entire mission
kit, with the exception of any forms required to remain in any hard-copy format, may be stored
electronically as long as all publications and forms are accessible as required for mission
accomplishment. Prior to off-station departures, the PIC or a designated representative will
ensure a current mission kit is on board the aircraft either in electronic or paper format. The kit
will contain, but is not limited to the items listed in Table 6.2. Items required by a unit or wing
directive to be carried by an individual crew member need not be duplicated in the mission kit.
Maintain sufficient quantities of directives and planning documents to allow implementation of
evacuation and contingency plans.

Section 6C—Briefings

6.7. Briefing Requirements. Crew members and supporting/supported forces will not fly
unless they attend the crew briefings for their mission. EXCEPTION: When pre-mission
requirements dictate, PIC may excuse certain members from the briefing. The PIC will ensure
that those members receive a face-to-face briefing prior to engine start.

Section 6D—Flight Planning

6.8. Call Signs. Use Voice Call Sign Listing (VCSL) if specified in mission directives.
Otherwise, use squadron or wing static call signs as directed.
   6.8.1. Not used.
   6.8.2. Search and Rescue (SAR). When tasked to participate in SAR operations, use the call
   sign “AIR FORCE RESCUE” plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number.
6.9. Flight Plans. Regardless of whether a flight plan is prepared by the aircrew or is furnished
by another agency, the PIC and navigator will verify routes and flight altitudes to ensure proper
terrain clearance. The aircrew navigator who prepares or accepts the flight plan will remain on
duty at the navigator’s station during departure and will brief the relieving navigator thoroughly
on all en route and destination hazards.
6.10. Fuel Planning. Use the appropriate fuel planning publication or Technical Order
specified in Chapter 11, or an approved Portable Flight Planning System (PFPS).
   6.10.1. Flying at long-range cruise at the cruise ceiling conserves the most fuel and is
   encouraged, but crews may elect to fly at other speeds and altitudes deemed appropriate for
   the mission. Crews should step-climb when atmospheric conditions and aircraft gross weight
   allow. Coordination between the navigator and flight engineer is essential for the most
   efficient fuel planning profile and should be accomplished. The flight engineer should cross
   check the fuel requirements of PFPS with the performance manual. Use primary fuel
   management, in accordance with the aircraft flight manual, whenever practical.
   6.10.2. Add extra fuel when fuel is unavailable at enroute stops; when compressed ground
   times during single-day, multi-sortie missions preclude refueling at each enroute stop; or,
   when enroute refueling would delay or be detrimental to mission accomplishment.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   49


   6.10.3. Fuel Conservation. Aircrews will review fuel conservation procedures in the
   appropriate flight manual and this instruction. Training missions should be planned at
   altitudes, routes, and airspeeds to minimize fuel usage. Crews should attempt to fly within
   these parameters as often as practical without compromise to mission objectives or flight
   safety. Additionally, give consideration to the following fuel conservation practices:
   6.10.4. Do not ferry unneeded fuel. It takes fuel to carry fuel. Ramp fuel and recovery fuel
   should be tailored to reduce aircraft gross weight within parameters of safe mission
   accomplishment and training requirements. (Temporary exceptions allowed for C-130
   aircraft affected by center wing-box issues).
   6.10.5. Minimize aircraft weight through reduction of equipment not necessary to
   accomplish the mission.
   6.10.6. After landing on taxi-back, consider shutting down unnecessary engines.
   6.10.7. Do not fly fast for crew convenience.
   6.10.8. Fly optimal altitudes to minimize fuel burn. Step climb when practical.
   6.10.9. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent profiles and power settings should also be
   considered for efficient fuel usage.
   6.10.10. Minimize use of GTC/APU. Use ground power units when practical.
   6.10.11. Establish C2 and flight following procedures to ensure timely notification of
   mission changes/cancellations to avoid unnecessary or unproductive flight time.
   6.10.12. Do not fly solely for the purpose of meeting flying hour program objectives.
   6.10.13. Fly missions at the most fuel conservative cruise speed option. On missions that are
   time rather than distance oriented, consider flying the lowest practical cruise option. Crews
   are encouraged to fly long-range cruise airspeeds on other missions, if practical.
   6.10.14. Use low speed ground idle or two engine symmetrical power when practical for
   ground operation.
   6.10.15. Cruise at the altitude that gives the best ground distance traveled for each pound of
   fuel consumed. As a technique, climb if ground speed is reduced less than 5 knots for each
   1,000 feet of altitude increase. Descend if ground speed will increase more than 5 knots for
   each 1,000 feet of altitude decrease. Do not fly above cruise ceiling.
6.11. Departure/Arrival Planning.
   6.11.1. The PIC will provide the obstacle height, distance, and gradient information
   necessary for performance computations for the departure, alternate, and destination airfields
   to the flight engineer. As a minimum, review the appropriate terrain chart or sectional chart
   in addition to the Standard Instrument Departure (SID) (if applicable). The flight engineer
   will complete the AF IMT 4064 C-130 Takeoff and Landing Data Card and the AF IMT
   4063 Mini C-130 TOLD Card, in accordance with Chapter 12. A pilot crewmember or
   additional flight engineer will cross check the AF IMT 4064/4063 for accuracy by using the
   performance manual, TOLD computer, or approved tabulated data. As a minimum, the
   person checking the data will:
      6.11.1.1. Verify gross weight independently from the AF IMT 4063/4064.
 50                                                             AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


       6.11.1.2. Cross-check air minimum control, takeoff, and landing speeds.
       6.11.1.3. Review and compare the computed distances, ground roll, and climb gradient
       (if applicable) with the actual conditions, runway available, and departure procedures.
   6.11.2. Flight Rules. Comply with AFI 11-202V3, AFSOC Supplement 1, and AFMAN 11-
   217 Volume 1 requirements for: Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and Visual Flight Rules
   (VFR) departures and arrivals; enroute weather requirements; and weather requirements for
   departure, alternate, and destination airfields.
       6.11.2.1. Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS).             IAW AFI 11-202V3 and
       applicable AFSOC Supplement.
           6.11.2.1.1. Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS). Ensure the proper mode of
           the GCAS is commensurate with the aircraft’s phase of flight.
6.12. Airfield Review. Accomplish review IAW AFI 11-202V3 and AFSOC Supplement 1.
6.13. Intelligence Briefing. Before departing on missions outside the United States, crews will
receive an intelligence briefing that will emphasize terrorist, enemy, and friendly political and
military development in the area in which they will be operating. In theater, aircrews should
receive intelligence updates on initial arrival at a forward operating location, or enroute stop, and
thereafter when significant developments occur. Report information of possible intelligence
value to the local intelligence officers at the completion of each mission.
6.14. Authenticators and Classified Material. Obtain and safeguard current authenticators
and other classified materials required for the area being transited. Carry authenticators when
flying into an ADIZ, participating in exercises, on overseas missions, deployments, and when
specified in operation plans.
   6.14.1. The Communications Security (COMSEC) material required depends on the theater
   of operation and user. The base COMSEC custodian can assist in obtaining the material
   required for the mission. Base Operations at AMC bases maintains the COMSEC material
   used on most missions.
   6.14.2. Turn in authenticators and other classified materials at your ultimate destination and
   obtain receipts for classified material. Command and Control Center will provide temporary
   storage for authenticators/classified materials during ground time at enroute stops. Issue and
   turn-in of authenticators is normally a function of Base Operations. At locations where no
   storage facilities exist, classified materials may be stored in the aircraft safe, if available.
       6.14.2.1. Remove classified information stored in the Global Positioning System (GPS),
       INU, or mission computers.
       6.14.2.2. Clear all Transmission Security (TRANSEC) systems, such as secure voice and
       IFF.
   6.14.3. In the event of an emergency, destroy classified material and equipment prior to
   crash landing or bailout, if possible.
6.15. Mission Folder. Each unit will develop a mission folder for each mission to ensure all
pre-departure information is available to aircrews.
6.16. Route Navigation Kits.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                       51


   6.16.1. The PIC or a designated crewmember will be issued a route navigation kit at the
   home station, which will remain with the aircraft until its return. Kits should contain
   sufficient quantities of materials to cover the complete round trip from the issuing station and
   return, plus appropriate materials to cover the theater of operation. This kit may be carried
   electronically following the guidance in paragraphs 6.4.1 and 6.4.2 EXCEPTION: En
   route charts will be readily available in paper format in flight at all times.
   6.16.2. If carried in paper format, segregate route navigation kits into two separate parts:
      6.16.2.1. Part I.   Sufficient material to cover the planned route trip and theater of
      operation.
      6.16.2.2. Part II. For inter-theater missions only. Maps, charts, and flight information

Section 6E—Pre-flight

6.17. C-130 Dash One Preflight.
   6.17.1. The aircrew Dash One preflight inspection, once completed, is valid for 72 hours
   provided the aircraft is either sealed or continuously monitored by squadron personnel.
   6.17.2. When an aircrew assumes a preflighted spare or quick-turn, a thorough visual
   inspection will be performed, paying particular attention to areas affected by maintenance or
   servicing.
 52                                                            AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


   6.17.3. Dash One preflight inspections are done in preparation for flight by the aircrew
   assigned to fly the mission designated for that aircraft. Having a partial aircrew, not
   scheduled to fly, accomplish one or more preflights for local training flights is not an
   acceptable practice. EXCEPTION: Operational Readiness Exercises (ORE), Operational
   Readiness Inspections (ORI), and contingencies/evacuations.
   6.17.4. All aircrew assigned to preflight and/or seal aircraft will comply with crew rest and
   duty restrictions in AFI 11-202V3 and AFSOC Supplement. A crew will not preflight more
   than 4 aircraft in a 12-hour period or perform preflight duties for more than 12 continuous
   hours.
       6.17.4.1. Duty not Including/Involving Flight (DNIF) crewmembers may accomplish
       preflights only with the concurrence of the flight surgeon. It is the responsibility of the
       crewmember to know his/her duty limitations. If possible crewmembers should have the
       flight surgeon document the AF Form 1042 appropriately IAW with AFI 48-123V3.
   6.17.5. Unqualified crewmembers may not preflight aircraft except under the supervision of
   an instructor.
6.18. AFTO Form 781. Review the AFTO Form 781 before applying power to the aircraft or
operating aircraft systems. The Exceptional Release (ER) must be signed before taxi. A
maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the ER.
If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the ER. Ensure that the DD1896,
Jet Fuel Identiplate and AIR card are on board the aircraft.
   6.18.1. For Red-X clearing at stations without maintenance support refer to Chapter 12.
6.19. One-Time Flights. An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that
might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to a repair
station. Refer to T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation,
Policies, and Procedures, for Red-X downgrade authority and procedures. One-time flight
approval authority is OG/CC or COMAFSOF. The chief of maintenance, the senior maintenance
officer, or the chief of the AFMC repair team must first authorize the release. After the
maintenance release is obtained, contact OG/CC, via stan/eval channels, for flight authorization.
The PIC's concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.

6.21. Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations.
   6.21.1. Aircraft Refueling. Maintenance personnel should be scheduled on missions where a
   need is anticipated. Two qualified personnel are required. Crew members qualified in
   refueling may only perform refueling duties at airfields away from home station when
   maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed.
      6.21.1.1. Flight engineers are qualified and authorized to accomplish these duties when
      maintenance personnel are not available. If ground support personnel are not available,
      the PIC will designate other crewmembers to assist the flight engineer. Use the
      appropriate checklist during all refueling and defueling operations.

      6.21.1.5. Deleted
      6.21.1.6. When crewmembers are required to refuel, the flight engineer will act as the
      refueling team supervisor. Flight engineers acting as refueling supervisors and panel
      operators will comply with T.O. 00-25-172 and applicable T.O. 1C-130xx series T.O.s.
      6.21.1.7. Concurrent Ground Operations. The PIC and Concurrent Servicing Supervisor
      (CSS) shall ensure aircrew members and servicing personnel accomplish concurrent
      servicing in accordance with T.O. 00-25-172 and servicing technical orders. Aircrews
      performing Dash-1 preflight inspections or cargo loading concurrent with servicing must
      have cooperation and close coordination with the CSS. The CSS will remain in
      continuous intercom contact with fuel servicing team members during the entire servicing
      operation. In keeping with the guidelines in T.O. 00-25-172, CSS has authority over all
      phases of CSS operations to include personnel participating in the refuel.
      6.21.1.8. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
      6.21.1.9. Simultaneous fuel servicing and ammunition loading is not authorized.
54                                                           AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


  6.21.2. Liquid Oxygen Servicing. Under no conditions are crewmembers allowed to service
  liquid oxygen.
  6.21.3. Hot Refueling. Hot refueling (refueling with aircraft engines running) will only be
  conducted by crews that have been authorized and certified according to AFSOC Hot
  Refueling Guide, C-130 Hot Refueling Operations Procedures.
  6.21.4. Fire Protection and Crash Rescue.
     6.21.4.1. The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum requirements
     for fire protection during engine start. If available, position a portable fire extinguisher
     for added fire protection.
     6.21.4.2. A fireguard is required for all engine starts including the GTC/APU.            A
     crewmember or ground controller may act as fireguard.
  6.21.5. Aircrew/Maintenance Engine Runs. Mixed aircrew/maintenance engine runs will
  not normally be accomplished. If conducted, the appropriate -1 procedures will be used.
  6.21.6. Towing. Aircrew members will not normally participate in towing operations. The
  PIC will coordinate with the senior maintenance officer or superintendent to ensure the
  towing supervisor and crew are qualified. At non-USAF installations, the PIC must have
  approval from the airfield operations officer or manager prior to towing. The PIC will ensure
  the tow team supervisor briefs all personnel on their duties and the associated hazards.
  Proper checklists will be used. If any doubt exists as to the qualification of tow team
  personnel or the safety of the operation, make no attempt to tow the aircraft until qualified
  Air Force personnel can be located. Under no circumstances will any crewmember act as the
  towing supervisor.
  6.21.7. When thunderstorms are reported within 10 Nautical Miles (NM) of the airfield, only
  operations leading to an immediate engine start and departure may continue. However,
  personnel must be prepared to cease all activities in the event lightning within 5NM is
  declared. When advised of lightning within 5NM of the airfield, all flight line activities will
  cease and personnel will seek shelter. Unless an immediate takeoff is a safer course of
  action, taxiing aircraft will return to parking.
     6.21.7.1. Munitions loading will not be initiated, unless it can be completed before
     lightning becomes a hazard. If munitions loading has begun and lightning becomes a
     hazard, the crew will cease loading and depart the flight line/hot cargo. Ensure that the
     Command Post notifies security forces that there will be an unattended aircraft with
     munitions. Unless immediate takeoff is a safer course of action, any taxiing aircraft with
     munitions aboard will return to hot cargo if lightning is declared within 5NM.
     6.21.7.2. Aircraft taxiing to parking or hot cargo when lightning is declared within 5NM
     should not expect a marshaller. The aircrew will hold in place or proceed to parking if
     clearance is assured. Seek shelter or remain in the aircraft if safer. Time permitting,
     coordinate with Base Operations (Pilot to Dispatcher frequency) if the aircraft will be
     parked in any location other than one assigned by the Air Mobility Control Center
     (Maintenance Operations Control Center) through the Command Post.
  6.21.8. During engine start the ramp will be down for emergency egress. The cargo door
  and ramp will be closed for takeoffs, runups, and anytime the aircraft is taxiing on the active
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                    55


   runway. Prior to takeoff, the loadmaster will remove and stow the right paratroop ladder
   (AC-130H).
6.22. Aircrew Flight Equipment and Oxygen Requirements.
   6.22.1. Oxygen. Oxygen on board for takeoff will be a minimum 10 liters.
   6.22.2. Rafts. Ensure sufficient wing well life rafts are on board to accommodate all
   personnel on over water flights.
   6.22.3. Life Preserver Unit (LPU):
      6.22.3.1. Ensure sufficient quantities of life preservers are on board for all personnel for
      over water flights. While over water, LPUs will be sized and available at the
      crewmember’s station, and worn whenever below 2,000 feet over water (except for
      takeoff and landing).
      6.22.3.2. If over water and the mission requires wear of the parachute, the LPU will also
      be worn.
   6.22.4. Anti-exposure suits. Anti-exposure suits will be available during over water flights
   when route of flight is beyond power off gliding distance from land and the water
   temperature is 60º Fahrenheit (F) or below. NOTE: Anti-exposure suits are not required
   when only the approach or departure is flown over water). If the water temperature ranges
   between 51º F and 60º F, the unit or mission commander may waive or extend the anti-
   exposure suit requirement after carefully considering the following factors:
      6.22.4.1. Climate zone and existing weather throughout range of flights.
      6.22.4.2. Operational requirements.
      6.22.4.3. Number and type of aircraft in formation.
      6.22.4.4. Time of flight over water.
      6.22.4.5. Risk, based on aircraft load and mission configuration.
      6.22.4.6. Degree of surveillance over mission.
      6.22.4.7. Location, availability, and capability of SAR forces (Consider anticipated time
      in the water prior to pick-up).
      6.22.4.8. Winds and wave height and their impact on SAR.
      6.22.4.9. Altitude and distance from land.
   6.22.5. Parachutes. All AC-130 aircraft will be configured with one parachute for each
   person.
      6.22.5.1. Prior to flight, brief and instruct all passengers on parachute use.
      6.22.5.2. During operations that require the cargo ramp, cargo door, or the paratroop
      door to be open in flight, personnel aft of the 40MM will wear a parachute or restraint
      harness.
          6.22.5.2.1. Wear a restraining harness during all operations below 1,000 feet Above
          Ground Level (AGL).
 56                                                            AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


   6.22.6. Survival Kits/Vests. All AC-130 aircraft will be configured with one survival kit
   (ML-4) for each aircrew member. Survival vests may be used in lieu of survival kits if the
   mission will not take them beyond gliding distance of land.
6.23. Aircrew Flight Equipment Documentation. AFE personnel will accomplish a thorough
aircraft preflight inspection prior to each mission. Local training missions only require a
preflight inspection prior to the first flight of the day.
   6.23.1. The PIC or designated representative will ensure appropriate serviceable protective
   clothing, AFE, survival equipment, and Dash 21 equipment for the entire mission are
   available prior to flight and all personnel are briefed or trained in their use prior to departing
   home station.
          6.23.1.1. Prior to departing home station and following en route crew changes, the PIC
          or designated representative will review the AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Life Support
          Equipment, to ensure all required equipment is on board and required inspections have
          been completed.
          6.23.1.2. The PIC or designated crewmember will document and ensure missing aircrew
          AFE are annotated in both the AFTO Form 781A and AFTO Form 46.
6.24. IFF/SIF Operations.
   6.24.1. Perform a ground check of the IFF/SIF before takeoff, using either the self test or
   ground radar interrogation.
          6.24.1.1. If self-test is unacceptable and radar facilities do not permit ground check,
          takeoff is authorized if the IFF/SIF was operational on the previous mission. Accomplish
          an airborne check immediately after takeoff.

 NOTE: Mode 4 is not required within CONUS unless ADIZ penetration is anticipated.
 NOTE: Carry a keyer for use in the event of rerouting or diversion, except on local training
 missions.
   6.24.2. Use the IFF/SIF IAW Table 6.4. NOTE: IFF/SIF mode 1, 2, and 3/A coded, once
   set and transmitted are unclassified and may be left in the transponder.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                       57


   6.24.3. An operational mode 4 is required. An operational check of the mode 4 will be made
   prior to takeoff (test equipment permitting). If mode 4 checks bad or fails in flight, the
   IFF/SIF unit will be repaired prior to flight and/or aircraft landed for repairs except per the
   following:
   6.24.4. Mode S. Mode S equipped aircraft have the capability of assigning a unique default
   code that is associated with a specific aircraft registration as well as the flight identification
   that corresponds to the filed flight plan call sign.
       6.24.4.1. Military aircraft have the ability to change the Mode S and Flight ID codes.
       Erroneous Mode S codes and/or Flight ID mismatch to filed aircraft identification
       degrade the safety and efficiency of air traffic control. Inadvertent duplication of an
       address will seriously degrade or even disable ETCAS operability.
       6.24.4.2. Aircrew and squadron operations staff must ensure that the assigned/unique
       Mode S address (default code) be loaded in to the transponder correctly. Flight plan filed
       call signs must match exactly to the Flight ID inserted into the transponder. There will be
       neither leading zeros nor spaces/dashes ahead of or between the characters entered in the
       Flight ID. If the call sign is less than 7 characters, the inserted Flight ID will have spaces
       only at the end. This procedure is IAW DoD FLIP General Planning.
       6.24.4.3. Ensure Mode S operation is IAW the aircraft flight manual. Due to its
       importance, anytime a Mode S code is entered, it will be verified by a second
       crewmember.
6.25. Cargo Documentation.
   6.25.1. Proper cargo documentation will accompany each load. The cargo manifest and DD
   Form 1384, Transportation Control and Movement Document and special handling
   documents as applicable, will be delivered to the aircraft before departure. The manifest will
   be one of the following:
       6.25.1.1. Computer printed product.
       6.25.1.2. 80/80 (Offline Manifest) listing.
       6.25.1.3. DD Form 1385, Cargo Manifest.
       6.25.1.4. DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest. This form is designed for use during
       exercises, wartime, and contingency operations.
   6.25.2. Special handling documents, Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods, will
   accompany the manifest as applicable
6.26. Dropped Object Prevention. During aircraft exterior visual inspections, pay particular
attention to surfaces, panels, and components which could potentially be dropped objects. If a
dropped object is discovered and the mission is continued, the flight crew will:
   6.26.1. Ensure the write-up is entered in the AFTO Form 781A.
   6.26.2. Notify the AFSOC Command Center as soon as practical. Include route of flight,
   altitude, and weather (i.e., turbulence, etc.).
6.27. Narcotics. Crewmembers will ensure narcotics and other unauthorized items are not
smuggled on board the aircraft.
 58                                                            AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


6.28. Flight Deck/Booth Congestion and Loose Objects.
   6.28.1. Hold the number of persons on the flight deck/booth to the minimum commensurate
   with mission requirements.
       6.28.1.1. AC-130H. At no time will the number of persons on the flight deck exceed 8
       or 7 in the booth.
       6.28.1.2. AC-130U. At no time will the number of persons on the flight deck exceed 7
       or 9 in the Battle Management Center (BMC).
       6.28.1.3. AC-130U. Fold down seats inside the BMC are authorized for use during the
       mission phases except takeoff and landing. Only instructors or evaluators (and
       crewmembers upgrading to these positions) can occupy fold down seats during takeoff
       and landing. This does not increase the crew complement, nor does it negate the
       requirement that each crewmember and passenger have an available, approved crash seat
       in the event of an emergency. The fold down seat will not be used during an actual
       landing emergency.
   6.28.2. Keep the flight deck area uncluttered and orderly for all flight and ground operations.
   Specifically:
       6.28.2.1. Do not place any item (checklist, chart, etc.) on the center pedestal in a position
       that covers or hides from view any switch, light, or gauge. Do not place any item behind
       condition levers or on the throttle quadrant.
       6.28.2.2. Do not store on the flight deck any items not required for use or immediate
       reference in flight.
6.29. Passenger Policy. DoD 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligibility, establishes criteria for
passenger movement on DoD aircraft. It defines five categories of passenger travel: space
available, aero medical evacuation, orientation, and space-required. AFI 11-401 provides further
guidance on orientation. Refer to these publications directly for details not addressed in this
instruction. In all cases, individuals will be manifested on DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest.
NOTE: See paragraph 3.3 for ACM policy.
   6.29.1. Space-available. AC-130s will not be used for space available travel.
   6.29.2. Aero medical Evacuation. Defined as the movement of patients by air. Specific
   guidance on eligibility and documentation is contained in DoD 4515.13-R. Commander,
   United States Transportation Command is the single manager for policy and procedure.
       6.29.2.1. Restrictions. If tasked to conduct aero medical evacuation, both pilots must be
       fully qualified. Air to Air Refueling (AAR) may be performed if required for mission
       accomplishment after coordination with tasking authority. All other mission events and
       simulated Emergency Procedures (EP)s are prohibited.
   6.29.3. Orientation. AFI 11-401 contains specific details on the Air Force Orientation Flight

       6.29.3.1. Restrictions.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   59


         6.29.3.1.1. For spouse orientation, comply with restrictions in AFI 11-401 and
         AFSOC Sup. Additionally, AAR and threat maneuvers are prohibited.
         6.29.3.1.2. For other orientation categories, both pilots must be fully qualified (does
         not apply to special qualification events not planned for the flight). AAR may be
         approved on a case by case basis by Group CCs or COMAFSOF. Simulated EPs are
         prohibited. All other mission events may be conducted as approved by approval
         authority. Passengers will be seated with belts fastened during threat maneuvers.
  6.29.4. Public Affairs Travel. Defined as travel in the interest of adding to the public
  understanding of DoD activities. See AFI 35-101 for guidance, to include approval
  authorities, for public affairs flights. Document authorization by letter and manifest on a DD
  Form 2131. Requests for approval will include the mission profile and mission events to be
  accomplished Forward requests through public affairs channels.
     6.29.4.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified in all sortie events. AAR may
     be approved on a case by case basis by Group CCs or COMAFSOF. Simulated EPs are
     prohibited. All other mission events may be conducted as approved by approval
     authority. Passengers will be seated with belts fastened during threat maneuvers.
  6.29.5. Space-required. DoD 4515.13-R lists several categories of passengers, not
  previously mentioned, who are authorized official travel on DoD aircraft. Any individuals
  not on flight orders will be manifested on DD Form 2131, Passenger Manifest.
     6.29.5.1. Supported forces. A sub-category of space-required passenger defined by this
     instruction as US and foreign military personnel who are an integral part of the mission
     being performed. Approval is assumed by the mission tasking. Supported forces will not
     normally be transported point-to-point on AC-130s. Group CCs or COMAFSOF may
     authorize supported forces on AC-130s on a case-by-case basis.
         6.29.5.1.1. Restrictions. Both pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI
         11-401. Simulated EPs are prohibited. There are no restrictions on mission events.
         Passengers will be seated with belts fastened during threat maneuvers. PICs will
         ensure that supported forces are briefed on the mission profile and mission events
         before flight.
     6.29.5.2. Supporting forces. A sub-category of space-required passenger defined by this
     instruction as US and foreign military, DoD civilians, and US civilian employees under
     contract to the DoD, who directly support the mission or a deployment of an AFSOC
     unit. This may include, but is not limited to; maintenance, communications, intelligence,
     logistics, fuels, and flight test personnel, unit-supporting chaplains, civilian contractors
     required for in-flight checks or deployment support, Federal Aviation Administration
     (FAA) representatives, STS, fire support officers, and other military personnel who are

          ensure that supporting forces are briefed on the mission profile and mission events
          before flight.
6.30. Military Customs Pre-clearance Inspection Program.
   6.30.1. The military customs program was developed to assist the DoD and other US
   Government agencies in the control of narcotics, contraband, and prohibited agricultural
   products, and to expedite entry of DoD personnel and material into the customs territory of
   the United States.
   6.30.2. Military Customs Inspectors will accomplish this inspection immediately prior to
   departure and may conduct more than one pre-clearance inspection on CONUS bound
   aircraft. When security considerations necessitate deviation from this policy, mission
   planners must coordinate with the appropriate agency to ensure the mission is not
   jeopardized.

Section 6F—Departure

6.31. Checklists. Accomplish all checklists with strict discipline. A checklist is not complete
until all items are accomplished. EXCEPTION: The After Takeoff Checklist may be called
complete with the exception of the leading edge check. Accomplish the leading edge check IAW
the flight manual as soon as conditions permit.
   6.31.1. Carry abbreviated checklists in the USAF flight crew checklist binders. The only
   pages (or inserts) authorized in checklist binders are C-130-series T.O. aircrew checklists,
   AFSOC approved checklists, briefing guides, and approved information guides. Units may
   construct locally approved in-flight guides using AF Form 4124, Flight Crew Information
   Guide.
   6.31.2. Make personal notes in pencil on checklists and briefing or information guides, if
   desired. Such notes must be current.
   6.31.3. An engine propulsion check may be performed anytime the crew deems necessary.
   If 95% engine efficiency cannot be obtained on all engines, the aircraft will not be flown.
   Accomplish the check IAW the specific flight manual.
       6.31.3.1. Request clearance from the ground or tower controller prior to an engine
       propulsion check. Advise controller when prop wash will cross the runway.
          6.31.3.1.1. Comply with the guidance in the flight manual and AFI 11-218 for engine
          run-up/propulsion system procedures.
              6.31.3.1.1.1. Not used.
              6.31.3.1.1.2. At no time will an engine run-up be attempted (throttles out of the
              ground range) unless the aircraft is in an approved engine run-up site (per Base
              Operations/Fixed Base Operator) or the active runway. NOTE: ATC clearance
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                         61


               does not constitute a safe environment for an engine run-up.
               6.31.3.1.1.3. Using the MDS flight manual danger areas figure, ensure the area
               behind the aircraft is clear before starting an engine run-up. WARNING: Prop
               blast from engine run-ups/propulsion systems checks is hazardous to people,
               buildings, equipment, and other aircraft.
               6.31.3.1.1.4. If an engine run-up/propulsion systems check was not
               accomplished, the first takeoff of the day will be static to allow for an engine
               efficiency check.
   6.31.4. The propeller static feather check procedure is normally considered a periodic
   maintenance function; however, if the flight engineer elects to perform this procedure, ensure
   engine oil temperature is 20º C or greater.
6.32. Ground Collision Avoidance System Operation. Operate the GCAS in the normal mode
(Audio On and Visual On) for all non-tactical operations. Crews may override the flap/glide
slope advisory during the approach to landing as long as the alert is acknowledged by both pilots.
   6.32.1. When a GCAS alert advisory/warning occurs and terrain/obstacles are clearly in
   sight, the flying pilot will call terrain/obstacle in sight, state intentions and visually clear the
   terrain/obstacles.
   6.32.2. When a GCAS alert advisory/warning occurs and terrain/obstacles are not clearly in
   sight, immediately level off/begin a climb while rolling wings level, and add maximum
   power until the warning has ceased and adequate terrain/obstacle clearance is verified.
   WARNING: Do not delay pull-up for diagnosis of a GCAS warning. WARNING: Failure
   to roll wings level will increase stall speed.
6.33. Traffic Collision Avoidance System TCAS/ETCAS Operations. It is imperative to
follow Resolution Advisories (RA)s to obtain aircraft separation computed by TCAS. Failure to
follow the computed RA may increase the probability of a midair collision. NOTE: This system
was not designed for use in the low-altitude environment, but it could provide valuable
awareness of light aircraft or other military aircraft using military airspace. Use of Traffic
Advisory (TA) only mode is recommended.
   6.33.1. Multi-ship Formation. Lead aircraft (or designated alternates) will operate TCAS in
   the “TA only” mode. Consideration should be given to having the last aircraft in multi-
   element formations operating TCAS in “TA only” mode.
   6.33.2. Use the above/below/normal settings as appropriate for the phase of flight and
   mission. The below setting should be used for tactical descents.
   6.33.3. TCAS event documentation. The PIC should document all pertinent information
   surrounding an RA event on the AF IMT 651 HATR, and submit the report to the nearest air
   force safety office.
6.34. TOLD Cards. The flight engineer will complete AF Form 4064 cards IAW this
instruction, Chapter 12. Power settings for departure will be based on type of takeoff and
distance and height of obstacle. A pilot or additional flight engineer will cross-check the data for
accuracy, by using the performance manual, Aircraft Performance Calculator (APC), or
approved tabulated data.
 62                                                            AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


   6.34.1. Cross-check minimum control, takeoff, and landing speeds. This should be done for
   the initial takeoff, landing, and for significant changes in operating conditions (e.g., flaps up,
   etc.).
   6.34.2. When performance is critical (e.g., high temperature, high altitudes, etc.) cross-check
   distances and ground rolls for the configuration to be used.
   6.34.3. Normally use reduced power for takeoffs provided Refusal Speed (Vr) is equal to or
   greater than takeoff speed. Use normal takeoff power if Vr is less than takeoff speed.
   6.34.4. IFR Departures. Comply with AFI 11-202V3 for IFR Departures. In addition to the
   requirements in AFI 11-202V3, chapter 8, the following guidance applies:
       6.34.4.1. Departure End of Runway (DER) crossing restrictions. A DER crossing height
       may be required depending on the agency which designed the instrument departure. If a
       DER crossing requirement exceeds 50 feet, use the correction chart in the performance
       manual for balanced critical field length for the first 50 feet, and add 50 feet to balanced
       critical field length for every foot of altitude required above 50 feet. Example: 55 feet
       DER crossing requires the full correction on the balanced critical field length chart plus
       250 additional feet of balanced critical field length.
   6.34.5. VFR Departures. Comply with AFMAN 11-217 V2, AFI 11-202 V3, and the
   following: The aircraft must be capable of clearing all obstacles along the planned departure
   path one engine inoperative. If obstacles are not a factor, the aircraft must always be able to
   climb at least 200 feet per minute on three engines at obstacle clearance speed. When no
   obstacle exists on the planned departure, plan climb out to 1000 feet AGL or pattern altitude
   whichever is higher.
6.35. Departure Briefing. The pilot making the takeoff will brief the crew IAW the flight
manual.
6.36. Power Application. To help prevent over-torque, the flight engineer will make a call over
the interphone any time torque reaches 17,000 in-lb. Pilots and flight engineers will monitor
torque as throttles are advanced.
6.37. Departure Monitoring. The navigator and pilot not flying the aircraft will back up the
pilot and report any deviations from the planned departure. When radar facilities are available,
departures will be radar monitored to the maximum extent possible.
6.38. Oxygen Requirements. IAW AFI 11-202V3, plus the following:
   6.38.1. Crewmembers occupying a crew station will have an oxygen mask connected and
   readily available for use before engine start and until engine shutdown. Prior to flight,
   crewmembers will accomplish a communications and operations check of their oxygen
   masks.
   6.38.2. Walk-around bottles do not satisfy AFI 11-202V3 supplemental oxygen
   requirements.
   6.38.3. Crewmembers who do not have access to the aircraft oxygen system will have a
   Passenger Oxygen Kit (POK) within arm’s reach for pressurized flights above flight level
   (FL) 250. Prior to flight, visually inspect the POK to ensure it contains an adequate supply
   of oxygen.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                      63


   6.38.4. Aircrews required to fly unpressurized missions above 18,000 feet mean sea level
   (MSL) will pre-breathe 100 percent oxygen for a minimum of 30 minutes. Begin pre-
   breathing so that uninterrupted pre-breathing times are complete before cabin altitude
   exceeds 14,000 feet.
       6.38.4.1. Avoid breaking oxygen mask seal (above 18,000 feet MSL) at these altitudes,
       even for drinking water.
   6.38.5. Decompression Sickness (DCS). For anyone thought to have symptoms of DCS, the
   following actions apply:
       6.38.5.1. As mission permits, declare an in-flight emergency, descend to as low a cabin
       altitude as practical, and land at the nearest suitable installation where medical assistance
       can be obtained. Clearly indicate the possibility of DCS so that medical personnel will be
       best prepared to treat affected individuals.
       6.38.5.2. Keep the person relaxed and as warm as possible and watch for potential
       symptoms in other crewmembers for the next 24 hours.
6.39. Flight Progress. Use all available navigational aids to maintain course centerline and
positive fixing of the aircraft’s position.
6.40. Navigation Aid Capability. Refer to Chapter 4, paragraph 4.3.8 for minimum
navigation capabilities.
   6.40.1. North Atlantic Region and the US West Coast/Hawaii Route System. Aircraft must
   have an operable INS/GPS/Self Contained Navigation System (SCNS) prior to airspace/track
   entry. Aircraft without this equipment must return to a station with maintenance capability
   or re-file via routes specified in FLIP.
   6.40.2. North Pacific (NOPAC) Region. Comply with the following procedures when
   transiting the Anchorage/Tokyo Oceanic Control Area/Flight Information Region (FIR) on
   the NOPAC north route:
       6.40.2.1. Westbound aircraft on the NOPAC north route experiencing loss of radar
       capability at any point shall, fuel permitting, re-file a flight plan on another track or
       return to the nearest facility with radar maintenance capability.
       6.40.2.2. Westbound aircraft on the NOPAC north route that have a single drift and
       groundspeed source and experience loss of that source at any point, may continue the
       NOPAC north route if the radar system is fully operable. Verify in flight that satisfactory
       returns are being received on all ranges, particularly the longer ranges (100 NM or
       greater). If the radar system is marginal or inoperative, fuel permitting, re-file a flight
       plan to another track or return to the nearest facility with maintenance capability.
6.41. Communications Instructions Reporting Vital Intelligence Sightings and Other
Reports. Refer to AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. Report all vital intelligence sightings
from aircraft as indicated in the FLIP Planning or Flight Information Handbook (FIH).
6.42. In-Flight Meals. The pilot and copilot will not consume meals within 90 minutes of each
other, before or during flight, if the meals were procured from the same vendor and consist of the
same menu.
 64                                                         AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


6.43. In-Flight Emergency Procedures. Report deviations from directives that occur as a
result of an emergency IAW AFI 11-202V3 and this instruction.
   6.43.1. Notification of Controlling Agencies. As soon as practical after completing the
   aircraft emergency action checklist, furnish the controlling agency and appropriate command,
   control, and communications (C3) a description and extent of the difficulty, assistance
   required, intentions, and any further pertinent information.
   6.43.2. Emergency Landing. Aircrews must be prepared to divert to the nearest suitable
   airfield. Navigators must be ready to provide pertinent information including headings,
   distance, and frequencies.
   6.43.3. Conference HOTEL. Conference Hotel. Lockheed Martin’s In-Flight Conference
   HOTEL personnel can be contacted by calling the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center
   Command Post (CP) at DSN 497-2612. They are manned 24 hrs/day and are tasked with
   arranging contact between operational units and appropriate WR-ALC Personnel, including
   management level as well as technical. As a back-up, call the WR-ALC/LFPSC
   Maintenance Control Office at DSN 468-3567, 3029, 5428, or 472-2837. They are also
   manned 24 hrs/day except for Christmas. See Table 6.5. for Conference HOTEL POCs.

       6.43.3.1. The PIC may initiate the conference when additional expertise is necessary to
       cope with emergencies or other conditions. It convenes at the lowest level where
       expertise is available, and will not be elevated for the purpose of keeping the next higher
       echelon informed.
       6.43.3.2. Technical Assistance Service. The PIC may request (at anytime in the decision
       process) technical support and additional assistance from their home unit, MAJCOM
       staff, maintenance representatives, and/or civilian contractor support.
       6.43.3.3. When in UHF or VHF range, initiate the conference over appropriate discrete
       frequencies. When out of VHF or UHF range, use HF radios to establish a phone patch
       with the nearest or controlling C3. Provide a narrative description of the situation
       including actions taken, intentions, and type of expertise desired.
   6.43.4. Turnaround Procedures. Use procedures IAW FLIP.
6.44. Continued Flight with Engine Loss. A flight may proceed on 3 engines to its destination
if 2-engine capability exists, favorable operating conditions prevail both en route and at the point
of intended landing, and a suitable alternate airfield is available at all times. If these conditions
cannot be met, the flight will terminate at the nearest facility (preferably military) which, in the
judgment of the PIC, offers safe and favorable operating conditions.
6.45. Fuel Jettisoning. Fuel will not be jettisoned except for combat conditions, emergency
conditions, or rescue missions requiring gross weight reduction.
6.46. Medical Assistance. When a person on board the aircraft requires medical care the PIC
will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical personnel may meet
the aircraft. The request will include the individual’s sex, approximate age, and the nature of the
medical problem.
6.47. Low Altitude Over Water Operations. The accumulation of salt spray on windshields
and side windows is a factor that must be considered for low-level over water flight.
Windshields on aircraft equipped with windshield washers can be cleared; however, salt deposits
on side windows will continue to restrict lateral visibility, possibly jeopardizing flying safety
diminishing search effectiveness. Weigh the above factors against mission urgency prior to
descent below 500 feet, when heavy seas or high surface winds exist. In some cases, it will be
preferable to fly at a higher altitude to avoid this hazard.

6.48. Crew Coordination. The pilot flying the approach will brief the crew on the descent,
approach, and landing IAW the flight manual. The other pilot and navigator will monitor the
approach and report any deviations from prescribed procedures. Crewmembers will confine
their activities to aircraft operation, descent and approach monitoring, and checklist
accomplishment from the initial descent point to block in. Under no circumstances will
crewmembers deviate from these duties except for in-flight emergencies.
6.49. Coupled Approach Procedures. When a coupled approach is flown, assume manual
control at or above published MDA or DA/DH.
6.50. Self Contained Approaches (SCA). IMC SCAs are operational procedures not normally
intended for publication in FLIP. Plan all SCAs IAW aircraft specific planning guidance. Fly
navigator-directed SCAs using ground-based radar monitoring, where available.
   6.50.1. All IMC SCAs must be approved through stan/eval channels by HQ AFSOC/A3 or
   designated COMAFSOF, and must conform to the criteria specified in AFI 11-230,
   Instrument Procedures, and the AFSOC supplement to AFI 11-202, Volume 3. Refer to AC-
   130 SCA planning guidelines in paragraph 18.26 for package construction and aircrew
   procedures. AFTTP 3-3.AC-130 also contains techniques for constructing SCAs.
6.51. Radar Altimeter Procedures. Set the radar altimeters to the HAT or height above
aerodrome for the approach being flown in accordance with the flight manual. Pilots and
navigators will crosscheck radar altimeters during descent to ensure adequate terrain clearance is
provided throughout the descent and maneuvering portion of the approach. Once established in a
VFR traffic pattern, the radar altimeter may be set at the discretion of the pilot.
6.52. Wake Turbulence Avoidance. Pilots must exercise the discipline necessary to ensure
wake turbulence avoidance criteria are observed during flight operations. Acceptance of a visual
or contact approach clearance, or instructions to follow an aircraft, is acknowledgment that the
pilot will maintain a safe interval for wake turbulence avoidance. The following instructions
expand wake turbulence avoidance criteria, but do not replace guidance in DoD FLIP planning.
   6.52.1. For VFR traffic patterns behind heavy jets follow the “Vortex Avoidance
   Procedures” in FLIP General Planning.
   6.52.2. Low approaches behind heavy jets will be flown no lower than that altitude which
   ensures the aircraft remains well above the flight path of the heavy jet.
   6.52.3. Pilots operating under IFR into US civil airports will request 5 miles separation
   under radar control or 2 minutes non-radar control from heavy jets (departure and arrival).

Section 6H—Postflight

6.53. Impoundment. If an aircraft is involved in a serious incident, the PIC should impound
the aircraft immediately and contact the AFSOC Command Center or controlling agency for
further instructions.
   6.53.1. Impoundment is the isolation or control of access to an aircraft or equipment item
   and applicable historical records so an intensified investigation can be completed.
   6.53.2. If required, impound the aircraft IAW AFI 21-101, Chapter 9.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                      67


Section 6I—Debriefing

6.54. Maintenance. The PIC and the flight engineer ensure crewmembers complete the AFTO
Form 781.
   6.54.1. The PIC reviews the AFTO 781, determines those discrepancies considered as
   mission essential and indicates them by entering “ME” (mission essential) in block letters in
   the lower left hand corner of the AFTO Form 781A discrepancy block. Use “MC” (mission
   contributing) to indicate any discrepancies that, if corrected, would substantially contribute to
   mission accomplishment, but are not mission essential.
   6.54.2. Use block 14 (discrepancy) of the AFTO Form 350, Repairable Item Processing Tag,
   with an AFTO Form 781 entry to identify and tag any defective item.
   6.54.3. Enter “Aircraft subjected to salt spray” on the AFTO Form 781A any time the
   aircraft is flown under 3,000 feet AGL over salt water, excluding takeoffs and landings.
      6.54.3.1. Bird Bath procedures. Clear water rinse facility (birdbath) usage guidelines for
      AC-130U. AC-130H will not use the bird bath.
          6.54.3.1.1. If a birdbath facility is unavailable make the following annotation in the
          AFTO form 781A, “aircraft subjected to salt spray, birdbath unavailable.” The
          following guidance will be used to maximize the effectiveness of the birdbath and to
          ensure safe operations.
              6.54.3.1.1.1. Crews will ensure that sensors such as the radar/Infrared Detection
              System (IDS) are off prior to entering the birdbath.
              6.54.3.1.1.2. The APU will remain off with doors closed to prevent flameout and
              flooding of the APU compartment.
              6.54.3.1.1.3. Set flaps to 100% and switch off and extend both auxiliary and
              normal landing lights.
              6.54.3.1.1.4. All four engines should be at normal ground idle with the lowest
              power setting available. Two engines in normal ground idle, and two in low
              speed ground idle may be used if aircraft weight does not restrict the forward
              movement through the bath.
              6.54.3.1.1.5. Complete the “AFTER LANDING CHECKLIST” after the rinse is
              completed, run the engines at normal ground idle for a minimum of two minutes
              to aid in drying out engine nacelles.
          6.54.3.1.2. Review local procedures for birdbath operating guidelines. Each birdbath
          is unique in design and function; local procedures such as direction of entry, wing tip
          clearance criteria, noise abatement concerns, etc., must be reviewed prior to birdbath
          use. CAUTION: It is possible to experience some type of overheat indication during
          or immediately following the birdbath due to water intrusion in the overheat warning
          systems. Each crew will have to analyze the indication and make a judgment as to
          the emergency action taken.
   6.54.4. Ensure fuel on-loaded or off-loaded during refueling is entered in the AFTO Form
   781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance.
 68                                                           AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


   6.54.5. Immediately after arrival, the PIC and other pertinent crewmembers debrief
   maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft, engines, avionics equipment, and all
   installed special equipment. At stations where there is no AFSOC maintenance, and
   maintenance support is required, the PIC ensures a thorough debrief is provided to the
   controlling C3 prior to entering crew rest.
6.55. Debriefing. The PIC or a designated representative will pass significant information to
support agencies, such as weather, ATC, or base operations. Debrief intelligence when
applicable. The PIC will conduct a crew debriefing after each mission. The debriefing will
include all applicable crewmembers so that common problems can be discussed and resolved.
Crewmembers may be excused from the debrief at the discretion of the PIC.
6.56. Aircrew Notification Procedures. When transiting installations, the PIC will establish a
point of contact with the local command post, local base operations, or local airport manager,
when the crew is billeted in off-base quarters. The PIC will be notified immediately in case of
incident or emergency affecting the safety or security of the aircraft.

Section 6J—Miscellaneous Procedures

6.57. Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture Inspections.
   6.57.1. Obtain Customs, Agriculture, and Public Health clearance, as required, prior to
   opening any doors, hatches, or windows, other than the crew entrance door, or enplaning and
   deplaning personnel.
   6.57.2. Proceed directly from the aircraft to Customs, Immigration, or Agricultural
   inspection for processing when required by the inspector.
   6.57.3. US military aircraft are sovereign. When cleared to over-fly or land in foreign
   territory, it is US policy to assert that military aircraft are entitled to the privileges and
   immunities which customarily are accorded warships. These privileges and immunities
   include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation;
   immunity from search, seizure, and inspections (including customs and safety inspections);
   or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or
   cargo on board. USAF PICs will not authorize search, seizure, inspection, or similar
   exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of HQ
   USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned.
       6.57.3.1. The PIC will not permit the inspection of their aircraft by officials of any
       foreign government. If requested to do so, the PIC and crew will deny access and seek
       aid from the senior AFSOC or other USAF representative, US Embassy, or consulate
       within the host nation. Customs or other officials will be informed of the above policy
       and requested to confirm their request through their own government and with US
       Department of State representatives. If necessary the aircraft will be sealed by the crew
       and the crew entered into crew rest and departure intentions will be canceled until
       resolution of the matter by appropriate authority. Inform command and control
       authorities by the fastest available means should this situation occur. When confronted
       with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should consider the following
       procedures:
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                    69


         6.57.3.1.1. In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement of the PIC
         to the foreign officials that the aircraft is sovereign and not subject to search without
         consent of HQ USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned. This should
         be clearly conveyed in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign authorities who
         may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft.
         6.57.3.1.2. If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC must negotiate
         to delay the search until contact is made with HQ USAF/A3O-AO or the appropriate
         embassy. The PIC should unequivocally state that they have no authority to consent
         to the search and that they must relay the foreign request to these agencies for
         decision. The PIC should then notify these agencies of the foreign request by the
         most expeditious means available. Thereafter, PICs should follow instructions
         provided by the appropriate embassy and HQ USAF.
         6.57.3.1.3. If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, the PIC should
         indicate that they would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel and
         mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so.
         6.57.3.1.4. If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their
         way on board an aircraft, the PIC should state that they protest the course of action
         being pursued and that they intend to notify both the appropriate American Embassy
         and HQ USAF of the foreign action. The PIC should then allow the foreign agents on
         board the aircraft, without physical resistance, and thereafter report the incident to
         HQ USAF and appropriate embassy as soon as possible.
         6.57.3.1.5. In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive
         cargo or equipment. These instructions and applicable provisions of classified
         supplements to the foreign clearance guide should be followed where applicable.
6.58. Border Clearance.
   6.58.1. Normal Operations:
      6.58.1.1. Border Clearance Responsibility. The border clearance responsibility will be
      as designated by the base or area command IAW AFI 24-401, Customs-Europe, AFI 24-
      402, Customs-Pacific, AFI 24-403, Customs-Southern, and AFI 24-404, Customs-
      Domestic.
      6.58.1.2. PIC Responsibility. Border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC, although
      many of the duties have been assigned to ground personnel and to the loadmaster. The
      PIC will ensure:
         6.58.1.2.1. Crewmembers and passengers possess current passports and valid visas if
         required.
         6.58.1.2.2. Crewmembers and passengers have current shot records or certificates of
         immunization.
         6.58.1.2.3. Cargo entry documents are in proper order.
         6.58.1.2.4. Departure or arrival to the US is through an air base where border
         clearance can be obtained.
70                                                          AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


         6.58.1.2.5. Border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and baggage, if
         required, is obtained before takeoff to a foreign area, or after arrival from a foreign
         area.
         6.58.1.2.6. En route to the US, the loadmaster has distributed personal customs
         declarations to all passengers and crewmembers; has briefed passengers and
         crewmembers on customs regulations in accordance with Chapter 13 of this
         instruction; and has prepared and compiled Customs Form 7507, General Declaration
         (Outward/Inward) for the PIC’s signature.
         6.58.1.2.7. En route to the US, the base of intended landing is notified of any change
         in ETA, to ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.
         6.58.1.2.8. A Permit to Proceed is obtained when the mission requires an aircraft,
         which has landed in the US for customs clearance, proceed to another US base to
         obtain border clearance. The permit delays customs inspection of cargo, passengers,
         and crew until arrival at the offload station, saving intermediate offloading and
         reloading normally required for customs inspection. The Permit to Proceed is valid
         only to the airport of next landing, where the border clearance must be completed, or
         a new permit obtained. Do not make intermediate stops unless required by an
         emergency situation or directed by AFSOC.
         6.58.1.2.9. When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs
         representative normally meets the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not
         deplane passengers or crewmembers, except a scanner, unless necessary for safety.
         Do not unload until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their
         designated representatives. This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and
         all subsequent landings until crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border
         clearance.
  6.58.2. Exercise and Contingency Operations:
     6.58.2.1. General. Certain missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or exit,
     require special procedures to expedite compliance with customs, public health,
     immigration, and agricultural requirements. A joint memorandum of understanding
     establishes procedures and waivers.
     6.58.2.2. Implementation. Traffic and border clearing agencies implement all or part of
     the agreement as necessary for each operation. Inspection and clearance may be
     accomplished at the CONUS on-load or off-load base instead of the normal air-point of
     entry, or at the foreign on-load or off-load base.
     6.58.2.3. Customs Procedures.
         6.58.2.3.1. Outbound.    No requirement.     Filing of Customs Form (CF) 7507 is
         waived.
         6.58.2.3.2. Inbound. Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival.
            6.58.2.3.2.1. CF 7507 (non-aircrew member list not required).

                 Baggage Declaration, for each non-aircrew member not under command of
                 the troop commander, to include observers, support personnel, civilians, news
                 reporters, and crewmembers.
                 6.58.2.3.2.3.3. Upon arrival at a CONUS off-load base, a Customs
                 representative meets the aircraft and accepts the troop commander’s certificate
                 with respect to troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are not
                 required. The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage.
                 Troops debark under the observation of the Customs representative with only
                 a spot check of articles and baggage. The Customs officer may elect to make
                 a more extensive inspection.
              6.58.2.3.2.4. For troops who are out of the country 140 days or more:
                 6.58.2.3.2.4.1. One copy of DD Form 1854 for each non-aircrew member.
                 This includes observers, support personnel, civilians, news media personnel,
                 and crewmembers. Personnel may use DD Form 1854 or CF 6059B, Customs
                 Declaration, when issued by the US Customs representative. See AFI 24-404
                 for further guidance.
                 6.58.2.3.2.4.2. Upon arrival at a CONUS off-load base, a Customs
                 representative meets the aircraft and accepts the troop commander’s certificate
                 with respect to troop baggage. Individual baggage declarations are not
                 required. The troop commander should have inspected troop baggage.
                 Troops debark under the observation of the Customs representative with only
                 a spot check of articles and baggage. The Customs officer may elect to make
                 a more extensive inspection.
       6.58.2.4. Public Health Procedures:
          6.58.2.4.1. The PIC ensures that all crewmembers and passengers are properly
          immunized.
          6.58.2.4.2. Spray the aircraft, if required
       6.58.2.5. Immigration Procedures:
          6.58.2.5.1. Outbound. No requirements.
          6.58.2.5.2. Inbound. Submit one copy of CF 7507 to the Immigration inspector.
          Refer to the Foreign Clearance Guide for any other required documents.
6.59. Insect and Pest Control (Aircraft Spraying).
   6.59.1. The PIC will ensure required spraying is accomplished when required by the Foreign
   Clearance Guide and certify the spraying on CF 7507, or on forms provided by the country
   transited.
 72                                                            AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


   6.59.2. Use insecticide, Aerosol D-Phenotrin-2%, NSN 6840-01-067-6674 (or equivalent),
   to spray the aircraft. Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on board. The only
   exception is when mandated by the FCG.
       6.59.2.1. Aerosol normally is dispersed at a flow rate of 10 seconds per 1,000 cubic feet.
       Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being sprayed. Do not
       spray any plastic surface or allow the spray to wet it.
       6.59.2.2. Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely loading fuel,
       baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and other
       similar spaces. CAUTION: If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after use,
       spray prior to boarding crew or passengers. Close all doors and hatches for 10 minutes
       after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on board.
   6.59.3. Spray for 50 seconds unless longer periods are specified for the country being
   transited.
   6.59.4. When the crew discovers insect or rodent infestation of the aircraft while in flight,
   notify the destination C3, base operations, or airport manager of the situation before landing
   so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.
   6.59.5. Upon arrival, do not open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required
   to inspect the aircraft for insect or rodent infestation. Do not on-load or off-load until the
   inspection is satisfactorily completed. This procedure may be altered to satisfy mission or
   local requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager.
6.60. “Due Regard” Procedures. When a unit commander authorizes a mission to be flown in
international airspace and in-flight operational requirements conflict with International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) rules and procedures, the PIC may make the decision to proceed
using “due regard” procedures, IAW FLIP General Planning and AFI 11-202 V3, while in
international airspace over the high seas.
6.61. Hazardous Material Procedures. The term “hazardous material” as used in conjunction
with airlift operations applies to the following classes and types of materials covered by AFJI 11-
204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials) and includes any
material which, because of its quantity, properties, or packaging, may endanger human life or
property.     Procedures in this paragraph apply whenever aircraft carry DoD Hazard
Class/Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 explosives, DOT Class A and B poisons, etiological or biological
research materials, radioactive materials requiring yellow III labels, and inert devices. Also
included are DoD Hazard Class/Division 1.4 explosives, oxidizers, compressed gases, flammable
solids and liquids, and corrosive liquids listed in AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous
Materials for Military Air Shipments.
   6.61.1. Briefing. Reference AFMAN 24-204.
   6.61.2. Cargo Documentation.        Do not accept hazardous materials unless proper
   documentation, certification, and identification of cargo are provided. This includes
   transportation control number entered correctly on both the cargo manifest and the Shipper’s
   Declaration for Dangerous Goods.
   6.61.3. Flight Planning. The PIC (unless specifically briefed otherwise):
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   73


     6.61.3.1. Enters “Hazardous Cargo” and the mission number in the appropriate section of
     the flight plan. Use remarks section of DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, and other
     information section of DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan.
     6.61.3.2. Plans the flight to minimize over flying heavily populated or otherwise critical
     areas.
     6.61.3.3. Prepares a departure message. The remarks section of the departure message
     should include the following:
         6.61.3.3.1. Department of Transportation (DOT) class and DoD hazard class or
         division, if applicable, of hazardous material on board (Include net weight of DOT
         Class A or B poisons and net explosive weight (NEW) of Class A or B explosives).
         6.61.3.3.2. Request for special support; e.g., isolated parking, security, technical
         escort teams, etc.
         6.61.3.3.3. Inert devices (when applicable).
     6.61.3.4. If Estimated Time Enroute (ETE) is less than 1 hour, or if other circumstances
     preclude timely receipt at destination, notify base operations at the first intended landing
     by priority telephone of the ETA and information listed in 6.61.3.3.
  6.61.4. Before Engine Start. Ensure placards are removed. Give the controlling agency
  parking location, approximate engine start time, and verify that the fire-fighting agency has
  the hazardous materials information. If not, request the following be relayed to the fire
  fighting agency:
     6.61.4.1. DOT class of hazardous material on board and the DoD hazard class or division
     for explosive material on board.
     6.61.4.2. Net Explosive Weight.
     6.61.4.3. Request for isolated taxiing (if necessary).
     6.61.4.4. Estimated Time of Departure (ETD).
  6.61.5. En Route. Normal procedures apply. Avoid flying over metropolitan or otherwise
  critical areas.
  6.61.6. Before Landing. Accomplish the following unless specifically prohibited by the
  theater commander or FLIP planning.
     6.61.6.1. Contact the base operations dispatcher, control tower, approach control, or
     other agency specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) before ETA to
     announce that hazardous materials are on board and to verify that the appropriate base
     support agencies have received the departure message. If not, transmit the mission
     number, ETA, and information listed in 6.61.3.3.
     6.61.6.2. If landing at a CONUS civil airport without a tower, give the above information
     to the nearest FAA flight service station.
     6.61.6.3. Request the information be relayed immediately to base operations or the civil
     airport manager, crash or fire protection agency, and other support activities.
  6.61.7. Parking:
 74                                                             AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


      6.61.7.1. DoD requires aircraft carrying DoD Hazard Class or Division 1.1, 1.2,
      explosives, DOT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions be parked
      in areas isolated from personnel. The PIC is responsible for ensuring cargo is correctly
      identified to the tower and ground control. When aircraft are not directed to an isolated
      area, identify the cargo again to tower or ground control. When identification is
      acknowledged, the host is solely responsible for selecting the parking area. Should host
      procedures be questionable, submit trip reports or hazard reports, as appropriate, to
      document such occurrences.
      6.61.7.2. The military host is responsible for placarding aircraft. For non-military
      installations, the briefing to the PIC will include placarding requirements and, if required,
      placards will be furnished at the on-load base. The shipper must make prior
      arrangements with the airport manager for shipments of hazardous materials requiring
      placarding. The shipper is responsible for cargo identification, fire-fighting procedures,
      and isolated parking requirements.
   6.61.8. Unscheduled Landing Due to In-flight Emergency.                   Transmit unclassified
   information to the appropriate air traffic control facility as follows:
      6.61.8.1. Nature of emergency and intent to land.
      6.61.8.2. Aircraft position and ETA.
      6.61.8.3. Number of personnel and location in aircraft.
      6.61.8.4. Fuel on board.
      6.61.8.5. That hazardous materials are on board, location of the cargo, and applicable
      information listed in 6.61.
   6.61.9. After Unscheduled Landing. Contact the AFSOC Command Center or appropriate
   C2 agency concerned by telephone, HF radio, or message, giving arrival notice, hazardous
   materials’ information, and other pertinent information as required.
6.62. Thunderstorm Avoidance. Avoid thunderstorm and cumulonimbus clouds (CBs) using
the following criteria:
   6.62.1. Climbout, en route, and descent:
      6.62.1.1. FL 230 and above: 20 nm.
      6.62.1.2. Below FL 230: 10nm.
   6.62.2. The size and intensity of thunderstorms or CBs are so variable that the PIC must
   determine avoidance takeoff and landing criteria. Takeoff, approach, and landing may be
   made without regard to the criteria in paragraph 6.62.1 provided:
      6.62.2.1. The thunderstorm or CBs and associated gust front, if present, can be avoided.
      6.62.2.2. The distance of from the thunderstorms or CBs is increased as soon as possible
      after takeoff to meet the criteria in paragraph 6.62.1.
      6.62.2.3. The missed approach course from the missed approach point will provide
      separation similar to that in climbout.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                75


     6.62.2.4. The aircraft is not flown below thunderstorms, CBs, or through the rain shaft
     associated with these clouds.
  6.62.3. Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a rapidly moving thunderstorm, the rain shaft,
  and the cloud base of thunderstorms and CBs. Do not fly under the anvil of a CB.
     6.62.3.1. Avoid thunderstorms visually, by airborne radar, or by specific request of a
     ground-based radar with a weather-mapping capability. When relying exclusively on
     ground-based radar for weather avoidance and the ground controller is unable to provide
     avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by either changing routing or diverting
     to an alternate. If unable to maintain VMC, declare an emergency and request priority
     assistance. NOTE: The use of ground-based radar as the primary means of
     thunderstorm avoidance should be used only to depart an area of significant weather. It
     should never be considered a normal avoidance procedure.

                                           Chapter 7

                                   AIRCRAFT SECURITY

7.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for aircraft security on ground and in flight.
AFSOC AC/C-130 aircraft are Protection Level "C" resources. This security priority designation
applies to operational aircraft, wherever they are located, worldwide. Some aircraft contain
equipment and documents that require protection per DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401,
Information Security Program Management.
7.2. Procedures. The PIC is ultimately responsible for the security of their aircraft when
located away from US military installations. AFJI 31-102, Physical Security, covers security
arrangements when US Air Force aircraft are located on other US military installations.
Arrangements must be made to protect the aircraft during crew rest status at non-US protected
locations. If US military security forces are not available, the US embassy assigned to that
country must be consulted to ensure security arrangements are made. For missions involving a
planning agency, the agency must coordinate with the PIC to ensure the planned security
measures conform to mission requirements. The amount of security required will vary,
depending on location and ground time.
   7.2.1. For non-permissive or uncertain environments, the agency requesting the mission is
   responsible for airfield and landing zone (LZ) security. The crew will work with the agency
   requesting the mission to insure security meets the requirement for the mission. See AFTTP
   3-3.AC-130 for security and planning details for these types of operations.
   7.2.2. For permissive environments, PIC will receive a threat assessment and force
   protection capability evaluation briefing at home station prior to departure and receive
   updates enroute, if required. When landing at DoD component installation, the instillation
   commander is responsible to provide adequate security for the aircraft. The PIC will
   determine if security is adequate. Planning agencies and PIC will use Table 7.1 to help
   assess the risk to parked aircraft for planned overnight stops located at non-US military
   installation overseas and civilian airfields. NOTE: Aircrews do posses the training to
   provide the appropriate security when present at the aircraft. For unscheduled or emergency
   landings at non-USAF installations, PIC will assess the aircraft security situation and take the
   following actions, if force protection capability appears insufficient:
       7.2.2.1. Aircrew surveillance. If the aircraft is not remaining overnight, aircrews are
       capable of maintaining appropriate aircraft security. The PIC will direct armed
       crewmembers to remain with the aircraft and maintain surveillance of aircraft entrances
       and activities in the aircraft vicinity.
       7.2.2.2. Area Patrol. Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include
       back-up response forces. If local authorities request payment for this service, use AF
       Form 15, USAF Invoice.
       7.2.2.3. Departure without Crew Rest. If local security forces are unacceptable or
       unavailable, the PIC may waive FDP restrictions IAW AFI 11-202V3 and depart as soon
       as possible for a destination with adequate force protection. If unable to depart the
       location due to system malfunction, the aircrew must secure the aircraft to the best of
       their ability. In no case, will the entire crew leave the aircraft unattended. Crew rest
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                    77


     requirements will be subordinate to aircraft security when the airframe may be at risk.
     The PIC should rotate a security detail among the crew to provide for both aircraft
     protection and crew rest until relief is available. PIC will coordinate through home
     station channels to acquire additional security.
  7.2.3. Tailored Security Measures. Standard physical security measures may be impractical
  at times due to mission, terrain, climate, sociopolitical sensitivities, or other factors. For
  example, some countries don't allow armed security personnel. On other deployments, the
  mission may rely on maintaining a low profile and attracting as little attention as possible.
  At such locations, tailor security measures to meet unique requirements when necessary. As
  a minimum lock aircraft entry points and hatches. If it is not possible to lock aircraft, secure
  aircraft entry points and hatches in a manner to indicate unauthorized entry, i.e., taping hatch
  release handles or using seals. The PIC is the final authority for determining tailored security
  measures. Contact with US Embassy personnel is required at locations where security
  agreements are not in existence.
  7.2.4. Ground security teams. Ground security teams may be considered to guard the
  aircraft for planned overnight stops. Teams may travel in Mission Essential Personnel
  (MEP) status and are responsible to the PIC at all times. The PIC will ensure security team
  members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress, and passenger briefings, as appropriate.
  The squadron commander is the final approval authority for the need of ground security
  teams for their aircraft and authority may be delegated no lower than the PIC.
     7.2.4.1. Ground security teams will comply with AFJMAN 24-204(I) at all times when
     carrying weapons, ammo, and equipment onboard the aircraft.
     7.2.4.2. Due to the sensitivity of weapons in foreign countries, ground security teams
     will keep their weapons inside the aircraft and out of sight of foreign nationals, even if
     the FCG allows them to be carried outside the aircraft. If a destination requires weapons
     be carried outside the aircraft, the controlling MAJCOM must approve such action prior
     to deployment.
  7.2.5. Unauthorized Entry. If, in the PIC’s judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked and
  sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry:
     7.2.5.1. Use the aircraft lock
     7.2.5.2. If the aircraft lock is unavailable, secure the hatches and doors in a manner that
     will indicate unauthorized entry. For example, tape inside hatch release handles to the
     airframe, so that entry pulls the tape loose. Close and seal the main crew entrance door
     or left troop door using a metal boxcar seal or other controllable device to identify forced
     entry. Wipe the immediate area around the seal clean to help investigate forced entry. If
     the seals are damaged or have been tampered with, notify the appropriate local
     authorities, the controlling agency, and inspect the aircraft thoroughly.
     7.2.5.3. Coordinate with the local base operations representative on procedures for
     servicing the aircraft while the crew is away. If a padlock is used, the key or combination
     will be left with base operations or the representative for servicing and maintenance
     personnel. NOTE: The aircraft should be locked during all off-station missions
     remaining overnight. NOTE: At a Temporary Duty (TDY) location with munitions on
     board a crewmember will be at the aircraft at all times or the aircraft will be locked. To
 78                                                              AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


       lock the AC-130H the camera door must be installed and tied down from the inside.
       Lock the right paratroop door at the bottom outside of the door. If the aircraft is left
       unattended, the aircraft commander will ensure the appropriate protection is provided by
       flight line security forces.
   7.2.6. Security awareness is crucial to effective mission accomplishment. Aircrews must
   always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.
   During pre-flight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas, to include aircraft wheel-
   wells, air conditioning compartments, and cargo compartment for unauthorized packages,
   personnel, or other unfamiliar devices. Report any suspicious items to host security forces.
   Aircrews will maintain a heightened security posture throughout all pre-takeoff activities.
7.3. Aircraft Force Protection Risk Assessment Matrix. Planning agencies and the PIC will
use this matrix to help assess the risk to parked aircraft in a permissive environment. This matrix
will be used for planned overnight stops at non-US military installations overseas and civilian
airfields. A cumulative score of less than 55 implies that normal unmanned aircraft security
measures are adequate. A score of 55 to 90 implies moderate security risk. Commander may
consider additional security measures. If the cumulative score is greater than 90, commanders
should consider deploying or contracting security personnel. The squadron commander or
mission commander is the final approval authority for aircraft security issues. Authority may be
delegated no lower than the PIC. Exception: during unscheduled or emergency landings the PIC
is the final approval authority for aircraft security. The PIC should contact the US Embassy or
United States Defense Attaché Office for security assistance. NOTE: Normally, additional
security for the aircraft is not required at military installation within a NATO country or US
civilian airfields approved by the FAA/TAS.

 TOTAL POINTS:
 1. Derive the local threat from valid intelligence sources only.
 2. “Adequate lighting” is equal to the illumination provided by one standard USAF light cart.
 3. If a security response team and security patrol is not present, commanders should consider
 deploying or contracting security personnel.
7.4. Protective Standards for Aircraft Carrying Distinguished Visitors (DV). This
paragraph applies specifically to aircraft transporting DV Code 4 or above. PICs are responsible
for aircraft security at en route stops.
   7.4.1. DoD Installations. Notify the base security forces of estimated arrival and departure
   times. Request continuous security surveillance during the entire ground time. If the
   installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available.
   7.4.2. Non-DoD Installations. Contact the airport manager or installation commander to
   arrange for force protection. If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security
   using AF Form 15.
7.5. Arming of Crewmembers. When directed, at least one crewmember each from the flight
deck and cargo compartment will carry weapons.
   7.5.1. Issue. Before departing home station, authorized crewmembers will obtain weapons,
   ammunition, lock, and key. Crewmembers must present a current AF Form 523, USAF
   Authorization to Bear Firearms, to be issued a weapon. Crewmembers will be reissued the
   same weapon until the mission terminates at home station. If an armed crewmember must
 80                                                            AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


   leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to another authorized crewmember, using AF
   Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.
   7.5.2. Loading and Transfer of Weapons. Load and unload weapons at approved clearing
   barrels/facilities if available. To transfer a loaded weapon to another crewmember, place the
   weapon on a flat surface. Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.
   7.5.3. Wearing of Weapons. Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect the
   identity of armed crewmembers. Do not wear weapons off the flight line, except to and from
   the C3, armories, and other facilities associated with aircrew activities such as base
   operations, fleet service, cargo or passenger terminals, flight line cafeterias, snack bars, etc.
   7.5.4. Weapons Storage. Crewmembers will be armed before beginning preflight or onload
   duties. When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons
   may be stored in the gun box during flight. If no gun box is available retain weapon for the
   duration of the flight. Crewmembers will rearm before landing. Weapons need not be
   unloaded before being placed in the gun box.
   7.5.5. Crew Rest. During crew rest, store weapons in the most secure facility available,
   normally the base armory. If a weapons storage facility is unavailable or the country
   prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box.
       7.5.5.1. Aircraft without a Gun Box. If an aircraft without a gun box must remain
       overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the
       nearest acceptable facility. Acceptable storage facilities are US or Allied military services
       armories US National Guard and Reserve armories, and US civil law enforcement
       armories. If none of these are available, or the PIC believes weapons security may be
       compromised, crewmembers may secure their weapons in their quarters, one
       crewmember will remain with the weapons at all times. In this case, turn the ammunition
       over to the PIC.
7.6. General Anti-Hijacking Guidance. Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist
an aircraft hijacking attempt, resistance may vary from dissuasion, to direct physical
confrontation, including the use of deadly force. Due to the sensitive nature of anti-hijacking
procedures, crewmembers should reference AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft
Piracy (for official use only) and the FIH for specific guidance. Aircrews will not release any
information concerning those procedures or hijacking attempts. Anti-hijacking is a crew duty
performed exclusively by aircrew personnel. The hijacking of an AFSOC aircraft could create a
serious international incident and jeopardize the safety of passengers and property. An aircraft is
most vulnerable when the crew is on board and the aircraft is ready for flight. Hijackers cannot
be dealt with as ordinary criminals. Some are mentally disturbed, emotionally unstable
individuals for whom the threat of death is not a deterrent, but a stimulus to crime. Delay tactics
have been most successful in saving lives and property. Detection of potential hijackers before
they board the aircraft is the best solution to the problem.
   7.6.1. Anti-hijacking inspections of space-required passengers may be conducted at the
   aircraft by the aircrew. Passengers (including MEP) will not carry weapons and/or
   ammunition on their person or in hand-carried baggage on board an aircraft. EXCEPTION:
   Special agents/guards of the Secret Service or State Department, and other individuals
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   81


   specifically authorized to carry weapons with coordination of the PIC. In all cases the crew
   will be aware of location of weapons and ammunition.
       7.6.1.1. If individuals must clear their weapons before boarding the aircraft, and access
       to clearing barrel/facilities is limited, as a minimum, direct them to:
          7.6.1.1.1. Move to a safe, clear area at least 50 feet from any aircraft, equipment, or
          personnel before un-holstering/un-slinging their weapons.
          7.6.1.1.2. Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures.
       7.6.1.2. Deadhead crewmembers will not retain custody of ammunition on an aircraft but
       will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC. EXCEPTION: During combat operations,
       personnel may carry unloaded weapons and ammunition on board the aircraft. When the
       tactical situation dictates, personnel who might engage an enemy force immediately upon
       deplaning at the objective may carry loaded weapons aboard the aircraft at the discretion
       of the troop commander/team leader, and with the PIC’s concurrence. Weapons will not
       be breached until clear of the aircraft.
7.7. Specific Anti-Hijacking Guidance. It is imperative that all crewmembers are familiar with
the ground and in-flight resistance actions, covert communications, and forced penetration of
unfriendly airspace procedures in AFI 13-207 and the FIH. In the event of a hijacking,
crewmembers must act immediately and resourcefully, without instruction, in order to counter
the attacker successfully.

8.1. General. This chapter contains a description of applicable reports and forms. For
assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing/group, unit, or local flight safety officer.
8.2. AF Form 457, USAF Hazard Report. Refer to AFI 91-202, The USAF Mishap
Prevention Program. The USAF hazard reporting system provides a means for Air Force
personnel to alert supervisors and commanders to hazardous conditions requiring prompt
corrective action. A hazard is any condition, act, or circumstance that jeopardizes or may
jeopardize the health and well being of personnel, or which may result in loss, damage, or
destruction of any weapons system, equipment, facility, or material resource.
8.3. AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report. Refer to AFI 91-202, Attachment 3,
Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR) Program.
   8.3.1. The Air Force HATR program provides a means for personnel to report all near
   midair collisions and alleged hazardous air traffic conditions. Use information in HATRs
   only for mishap prevention. AFI 91-202 list reportable incidents.
   8.3.2. Procedures:
       8.3.2.1. Make an airborne report of the hazardous condition to the nearest ATC agency
       (e.g., center, flight service station, control tower, or aeronautical radio station), and give
       the following information as appropriate:
           8.3.2.1.1. Identification or call sign.
           8.3.2.1.2. Time and place (radial/distance measuring equipment, position relative to

           8.3.2.1.4. Description of the other aircraft or vehicle.
           8.3.2.1.5. Include a verbal statement as soon as possible after occurrence that a
           written HATR will be filed upon landing. NOTE: ATC agencies (e.g., FAA, etc)
           must know if an official report is being filed.
       8.3.2.2. File the HATR as soon as possible (within 24 hours) using any available means
       of communication. Normally, it should be filed at the base operations office at the
       landing airport. If this is impractical and if communications permit, notify the safety
       office of the Air Force base where the condition occurred, the safety office at the home
       station, or as prescribed by the overseas MAJCOM. In any case, provide the safety office
       with all available information needed to prepare AF Form 651. Turn in the completed
       AF Form 651 to the wing/group safety office. NOTE: HATRs are not privileged
       information and may be released outside the USAF.
   8.3.3. Individuals submitting a HATR are granted immunity from disciplinary action
   provided:
       8.3.3.1. Their violation was not deliberate.

                                             Chapter 9

                                 FLYING TRAINING POLICY

9.1. General. This chapter outlines procedures, requirements, and restrictions for training and
evaluation missions. Refer to AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training, AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew
Standardization/ Evaluation Program, AFI 11-2AC-130, Volume 1, AC-130 Aircrew Training,
and AFI 11-2AC-130, Volume 2, AC-130 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria for additional information.
9.2. Instructor or Flight Examiner Briefings. Before all training/evaluation missions,
instructors/flight examiners will brief their students/examinees on the training/evaluation
requirements, objectives, planned profiles, and seat changes.
9.3. Debriefing. After all training flights, instructors will:
   9.3.1. Review and critique student performance.
   9.3.2. Review training requirements fulfilled for each student and aircrew member (all
   aircrew members should understand thoroughly what training was accomplished).
   9.3.3. Answer technical questions.
   9.3.4. Preview the objectives of the next mission.
   9.3.5. Complete all required documentation.
9.4. Simulated Emergency Flight Procedures.
   9.4.1. Simulate emergencies (engine shutdown, placing switches in other than their normal
   positions, or an abnormal configuration such as no flap landing or simulated engine failure)
   only during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner
   pilot is in one of the pilot seats. Instructor pilot candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are
   under the supervision of a flight examiner pilot, not in a pilot seat, may practice simulated
   emergency procedures during initial or re-qualification upgrade evaluations. Preface all
   simulated emergencies with the word "simulated" and terminate simulated emergencies if an
   actual emergency arises. All maneuvers discussed in paragraph 9.8 require an instructor or
   flight examiner pilot in accordance with this paragraph, unless otherwise specified in the
   restrictions.
   9.4.2. When conducting simulated engine(s) out training, the flight engineer will post actual
   charted minimum control speeds on the TOLD card. The instructor pilot should strive to
   maintain near, but not less than, zero torque on the simulated shutdown engine(s).
   9.4.3. The following guidance applies to all engine(s) out training on AFSOC C-130 aircraft:
       9.4.3.1. Instructor pilots should review T.O. 1C-130H-1-1, Performance Data, chapter 3
       and appropriate T.O. 1C-130(A)H/U-1 chapter 3 information with their trainee(s) before
       flight. A complete understanding of minimum control speeds and the factors affecting
       those speeds are critical to performing simulated engine(s) out training successfully.
       9.4.3.2. Normally turns should be planned to be in the direction of the good engines.
       9.4.3.3. Turns into simulated failed engines should be minimized. Turns into simulated
       failed engines are permissible but require a higher degree of pilot skill than with actual
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                      87


      failed engines and must be smooth and coordinated. WARNING: Improper application
      of rudder or power can lead to an immediate out-of-control situation from which recovery
      might not be possible.
   9.4.4. Simulated EPs are prohibited with passengers on board. EXCEPTION: Simulated
   EPs required for the purposes of a functional check flight are authorized. In this context,
   personnel on board are required for mission accomplishment. Limit personnel to the absolute
   minimum required.
   9.4.5. Conduct simulated emergency flight procedures IAW AFI 11-202V3, chapter 5 and
   this instruction. Use a realistic approach and do not compound emergencies. Limit
   simulated emergencies to non-critical phases of flight when possible. Notify the controlling
   agency if a nonstandard traffic pattern or pattern requiring special sequencing is anticipated.
   9.4.6. Request “option approach” prior to initiating an approach when a landing or low
   approach option is desired. (Example: “Request Instrument Landing System (ILS) option
   approach.”)
   9.4.7. Training maneuver restrictions for specific flight maneuvers and missions are listed in
   paragraph 9.8
9.5. Touch-and-Go Landings.
   9.5.1. Touch-and-go landings may be performed by:
      9.5.1.1. Instructor pilots, instructor pilot candidates on initial or re-qualification
      instructor evaluations, or flight examiner pilots in either pilot seat.
      9.5.1.2. Any pilot from either seat providing an instructor pilot, instructor pilot candidate
      on initial or re-qualification instructor evaluation, or flight examiner pilot is in the other
      seat.
      9.5.1.3. Any current and qualified pilot when the aircraft commander is touch-and-go
      certified and is so designated on the flight orders. FP and above may fly from either seat,
      but copilot qualified pilots (MC, FC) must fly from the right seat, except as authorized
      above.
   9.5.2. Touch-and-go landings are authorized when the crosswind component corrected for
   RCR is within the recommended zone of the landing crosswind chart. Ceiling and
   visibility/RVR must be at least 300 feet and ¾ mile (RVR 40).
   9.5.3. Include type of touch-and-go as part of the crew briefing, i.e., ground idle or flight
   idle. Do not perform no-flap ground idle touch-and-go landings.
   9.5.4. Touch-and-go landings are not authorized when normal wake turbulence criteria is not
   met, or when intercepting or crossing the flight path of a jumbo jet while performing an
   approach or landing.
   9.5.5. The minimum runway for touch-and-go landings is 6,000 feet; 7,000 feet for ground
   idle touch-and-go.

   4139. Computer flight plans may be used in lieu of the AF Form 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and
   Flight Log and the flight plan portion of the AF Form 4116.
   11.1.3. Definitions. Category II Routes are defined as any route on which the position of the
   aircraft can be accurately determined by the overhead crossing of a radio aid (Non directional
   beacon (NDB), VHF Omnidirectional Radio (VOR), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) at
   least once each hour with positive course guidance between such radio aids. Category I
   Routes are defined as any route that does not meet the requirements of a Category II route,
   including low level and over-water routes.
   11.1.4. Navigators will personally maintain charts and navigator’s logs used on Category I
   routes as part of the flight record for a minimum of 30 days.
11.2. General Mission Planning Procedures.
   11.2.1. Flight Plans. Regardless of whether a flight plan is prepared by the aircrew or is
   furnished by another agency, the aircraft commander and navigator will verify routes and
   altitudes to ensure proper terrain clearance. On overseas flights, verify the flight planned
   routing against the diplomatic clearance, if applicable. The navigator preparing or accepting
   the flight plan will remain on duty at the navigator’s station during departure. Ensure all
   required fuel computations are accurate and complete, and confirm the ramp fuel load is
   compatible with mission requirements. During a crewmember change, the navigator on duty
   will thoroughly brief the relieving navigator.
   11.2.2. Category I Routes. Accomplish flight planning using the AF Form 4116, or a
   Computer Flight Plan (CFP). Compute the required fuel load using the AF Form 4116 or AF
   Form 4139.
   11.2.3. Category II Routes. Use the AF Form 70, AF Form 4116, or a CFP. Compute
   required fuel using the AF Form 4116, or AF Form 4139. Not required in the local flying
   area. For local training sorties, a personal log may be used.
   11.2.4. Provide a copy of the flight plan to the pilot.
   11.2.5. Fuel Planning. Required on all missions. Use AF Form 4116 or AF Form 4139. For
   tactical missions and local training sorties, a personal log may be used. Fuel requirements
   and calculations will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202V3, AFSOC Sup 1, this instruction,
   and appropriate performance T.O. Accomplish fuel-planning IAW the appropriate C-130
   fuel planning publications in Table 11.1. When using T.O. 1C-130(A)H-1-1 fuel planning
   charts, use 100% engine performance. CFP en route fuel may be used for fuel analysis in
   lieu of en route fuel derived from the performance T.O.

   11.2.6. AC-130 navigators will compute an abort point along the AAR track where
   conditions will allow for a safe return to a refueling base with appropriate fuel reserves IAW
   AFI 11-202V3 and this instruction. This will be used in the event AAR is unable to be
   completed. Label this point on the navigator's chart.
   11.2.7. Signature Block. If using AF Form 4116, or equivalent CFP, sign the form after
   completing the flight plan portion (or verifying the CFP) and completing the time and fuel
   analysis, wind factor, and Equal Time Point (ETP) data. The Navigator Signature block is
   found in Section II of the AF Form 4116.
11.3. Computer Flight Planning. The aircrew is always responsible for accuracy of data used
in flight. All computer generated flight plans will be verified for correctness prior to each flight.
Use only AFSOC approved computer flight planning software. Untested or Beta versions of
developing software will not be used for actual mission planning.
   11.3.1. Creating Flight Logs. CFPs from approved flight planning software may be used in
   lieu of manual flight log (AF Form 4116) so long as the CFP provides same information
   found on manual flight log.
   11.3.2. Electronic Data Transfer. If the flight planning computer transfers a flight plan to the
   aircraft electronically, it must be an AFSOC approved system. Aircrews will not use
   unapproved versions of any system to load an aircraft navigation computer.
   11.3.3. Air Mobility Command (AMC) CFPs. AMC CFPs may be available for missions
   that meet CFP support criteria and are within the capability of the system. Obtain the CFP
   through the command post, base weather facility, or base operations dispatcher. Review
   AMC provided CFP to ensure accuracy for AC-130 missions.
   11.3.4. Computer Fuel Plans. Computer aided flight-planning systems (that meet the criteria
   in paragraph 11.3.1) produce flight plans and fuel calculations for C-130 and other aircraft.
   Computer Flight Plans may be used in place of the AF Form 4116. However, add alternate,
   identified extra, and reserve fuel if not included in the calculation. The printed format is user
   configurable and may be tailored to local needs.
11.4. ETP Calculations.
   11.4.1. Use Section II (Fuel/ETP Planning), ETP Calculation portion, of AF Form 4116. For
   AC-130 missions, Wind Factor and ETP Data Computations are required on Category I
   routes or Category I portions of routes when the total time between the last suitable airfield
   (LSAF) and the First Suitable Airfield (FSAF) is 5 hours or more. Suitable airfields are
   those within 100 NM of flight planned course centerline meeting weather, fuel, and AFSOC
   C-130 runway requirements.
       11.4.1.1. For air-to-air refueling missions, make a separate computation for each fuel
       analysis required. The ETP should drive the location of your planned AAR track. Plan
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                93


     to have sufficient fuel at each End-Air-Refueling (EAR) point to proceed to an abort base
     if the tanker does not show or if otherwise unable to complete refueling. Use a point
     abeam the AAR abort base as the LSAF or FSAF for wind factor computations.
     11.4.1.2. Wind factor and ETP computations are not required for round robin or search
     missions.
  11.4.2. Wind Factor Data. For wind factor data, LSAF means level-off, abeam or over
  LSAF, or closest planned checkpoint or radio aid within 100 NM of LSAF. FSAF means
  abeam or over FSAF, closest planned checkpoint or radio aid within 100 NM of FSAF,
  descent point, or destination. Use any of the options in the ETP options graph, Figure 11.1.
  Specify the option used in the ETP computations section of the AF Form 4116. Record
  computations in the ETP computations section.
     11.4.2.1. Total. Compute the average ground speed (GS) between LSAF and FSAF.
     11.4.2.2. 1st Half. Compute the average GS between LSAF and approximate midpoint
     between LSAF and the FSAF. Subtract flight-planned average True Airspeed (TAS)
     from the computed average GS to obtain the 1st half wind factor.
     11.4.2.3. 2nd Half. Compute the average GS between the approximate midpoint and the
     FSAF. Subtract flight planned TAS from the computed average GS to obtain the 2nd half
     wind factor.
  11.4.3. ETP Data.
     11.4.3.1. DISTANCE (LSAF TO FSAF). Enter the total distance (regardless of level
     off) from or abeam the LSAF along course from departure to or abeam the FSAF long
     course toward destination.
     11.4.3.2. (T) MIN. The flight time from the ETP to the FSAF or return to the LSAF.
     11.4.3.3. TOTAL TIME TO FSAF - T = TIME TO ETP. Subtract the time, (T) MIN,
     from the total flight plan time to the FSAF. TIME TO ETP is the total time from
     departure to the ETP (departure and takeoff may not necessarily be the same). Compute
     and record ETA to ETP by adding TIME TO ETP to departure time.

11.5. AF Form 4116 Fuel Planning.
   11.5.1. Use AF Form 4116, Section II (Fuel/ETP Planning). With the exceptions of the
   items explained in the following paragraphs, all items of the fuel analysis portion of this
   section are described fully in Table 11.2. See Figure 11.3. for an example of a completed AF
   Form 4116 Fuel Planning section. NOTE: To compute terminal fuel flow, use the specific
   range charts or the range summary charts in the applicable aircraft performance manual.
   Terminal fuel flow derived from an approved CFP may also be used. NOTE: The IMT AF
   Form 4116 has several overprints for C-130 use and should not be confused for AC-130
   requirements. As seen on the IMT form, these include Holding entry of 2.0, and Taxi entry
   of 1.3 (AC-130 entry will be either 1.3 or 2.0).
      11.5.1.1. Endurance. Flying time based on fuel available at takeoff (Item 11 minus Item
      9). It is extracted from the appropriate fuel planning publication, performance manual for
      the planned constant altitude, forecast temperature deviation, and the aircraft gross
      weight at takeoff.

       11.6.2.2. EN ROUTE (item 1). Calculate en route fuel from T/O to EAR using the flight
       planned cruise profile to the air refueling track. Increased fuel burn for time spent at
       lower altitude while on the AAR track will be accounted for in IDENTIFIED EXTRA
       (item 3).
       11.6.2.3. IDENTIFIED EXTRA (item 3). Include 1000 pounds per hour for the time
       anticipated at lower altitude on the track prior to and during actual air refueling .
       11.6.2.4. RESERVE (item 5). Ten percent of planned time from takeoff to EAR #1.
       Compute at terminal fuel flow; 0+45 maximum.
       11.6.2.5. FUEL AT EAR #1 (No On-load) B-6, (item 7). Fuel remaining at the EAR #1,
       does not include AAR on-load.
       11.6.2.6. PLANNED EAR #1 FUEL (item 8). Planned fuel at EAR #1 including the
       planned fuel transfer.
   11.6.3. Section II, EAR #1 TO AAR #1 ABORT BASE:
       11.6.3.1. Complete to account for an unsuccessful fuel transfer. An abort base is
       required for all refueling tracks. The departure base may be used. The designated abort
       base must meet alternate airfield weather requirements.
       11.6.3.2. EN ROUTE (item 9). Time from EAR to abort base.
       11.6.3.3. RESERVE (item 10). Ten percent of planned time from EAR #1 to abort base.

     11.6.3.5. HOLDING (item 12). Use 2,500 pounds if abort base is in Alaska, or at
     latitudes greater than 59 degrees N/S, or no alternate is available.
     11.6.3.6. PLANNED RAMP FUEL (item 16). Must be sufficient to meet the
     requirements of (item 17, required ramp fuel) and the requirements of Section V fuel
     planning.
     11.6.3.7. REQUIRED RAMP FUEL (item 17). Fuel required to fly from departure to
     the end air refueling point and continue to the AAR abort base with required reserves, in
     the event of an unsuccessful fuel transfer during the AAR. Includes fuel required to fly
     the entire air refueling track without a successful fuel transfer.
     11.6.3.8. UNIDENTIFIED EXTRA (item 18). Does not need to meet the normal
     requirement (not to exceed 2200 pounds), since item 8 (Planned EAR #1 Fuel) must be
     sufficient to meet Section V, EAR to destination fuel requirements. If unidentified extra
     fuel is excessive, consideration should be given to reducing the proposed ramp fuel and
     increasing the proposed AAR on-load if possible.
  11.6.4. Section III, EAR #1 TO EAR #2. Not applicable to single air refueling missions.
  11.6.5. Section IV, EAR #2 TO AAR #2 ABORT BASE. Not applicable to single air
  refueling missions.
  11.6.6. Section V, EAR TO DESTINATION:
     11.6.6.1. Items separated by a diagonal ( / ) in this section are applicable to both single
     and double air refueling missions. The item letter or number prior to the diagonal (/)
     applies to single air refueling planning.
     11.6.6.2. EN ROUTE (item 38). Time from end air refueling to final destination. Use
     the planned cruise profile for fuel calculations.
     11.6.6.3. RESERVE (item 39). Ten percent of planned time from EAR to destination,
     not to exceed 0+45. Compute at terminal fuel flow.
     11.6.6.4. HOLDING (item 41). Use 2,500 pounds if abort base is in Alaska, or at
     latitudes greater than 59 degrees N/S.
     11.6.6.5. REQUIRED EAR TO DEST (item 44). This is the actual fuel, including
     reserves, required at the EAR point to fly to the destination. Do not exceed the aircraft
     maximum gross weight limit established in the applicable flight manual.
     11.6.6.6. REQUIRED FUEL AT EAR (PRIOR TO ONLOAD) (item 47). The
     difference between the required EAR to destination fuel (item 44) and planned fuel on-
     load from the tanker (item 45).
  11.6.7. UNIDENTIFIED EXTRA. Subtract required fuel at EAR (prior to on-load) (item
  47) from the planned fuel at EAR (item 46). This value equals the extra fuel carried or
  additional fuel required (if negative) from the EAR to destination. When negative, additional
  fuel must be added, to ramp fuel, to the planned AAR on-load from the tanker, or in some
  situations may require moving the air refueling track or adding a second refueling.

      fuel using the flight planned cruise profile from takeoff to the AAR track. Increased fuel
      burn for time spent at lower altitude while on the AAR track will be accounted for in
      IDENTIFIED EXTRA (item 3).
      11.6.8.3. IDENTIFIED EXTRA (item 3). Include 1000 pounds per hour to compensate
      for the time anticipated at lower altitude on the track prior to and during actual air
      refueling for AAR #1.
      11.6.8.4. RESERVE (item 5). Ten percent of planned time from takeoff to EAR #1.
      Compute at terminal fuel flow; 0+45 maximum.
      11.6.8.5. TOTAL (item 6). Total fuel required from TAKEOFF TO EAR #1. Does not
      include abort base fuel requirements.
      11.6.8.6. FUEL AT EAR #1, no on-load (item 7). Fuel remaining at the EAR point.
      This item does not include the air refueling on-load for AAR #1.
      11.6.8.7. PLANNED EAR #1 FUEL (item 8). Fuel at EAR #1 including the planned
      fuel on-load. This fuel quantity must be sufficient to meet the fuel requirements of
      Section IV (EAR #2 to AAR #2 abort base, item 35) and Section V (Required fuel at
      EAR #2 prior to on-load, item 47).
  11.6.9. Section II, EAR #1 TO AAR #1 ABORT BASE (See Figure 11.4 for an example).
      11.6.9.1. Complete to account for an unsuccessful fuel transfer for AAR #1. An abort
      base is required for all refueling tracks. The departure base may be used. The designated
      abort base must meet alternate airfield weather requirements.
      11.6.9.2. EN ROUTE (item 9). Time from EAR #1 to the abort base.
      11.6.9.3. RESERVE (item 10). Ten percent of planned time from EAR #1 to abort base.
      Combined total for item 5 plus item 10 should not exceed 0+45. If the combined total
      exceeds 0+45, add only the balance for a total of 0+45 in this block. Compute at terminal
      fuel flow; entry only required when the flight time from EAR to alternate exceeds 1+30.
      11.6.9.4. AAR #1 ABORT ALTERNATE (item 11). Optional entry.
      11.6.9.5. HOLDING (item 12). Use 2500 pounds if abort base is in Alaska, at latitudes
      greater than 59 degrees N/S, or no alternate is available.
      11.6.9.6. PLANNED RAMP FUEL (item 16). Must be sufficient to meet the
      requirements of (item 17, required ramp fuel) and the requirements of Section V fuel
      planning.
      11.6.9.7. REQUIRED RAMP FUEL (item 17). This only considers the fuel required to
      fly from departure to the end air refueling point and continue to the AAR abort base with
      required reserves, in the event of an unsuccessful fuel transfer during AAR #1. It
      includes fuel required to fly the entire air refueling track without a successful fuel
      transfer. It does not consider the planned ramp fuel needed to complete the fuel
      requirements to the AAR #2 abort base or the destination.
      11.6.9.8. UNIDENTIFIED EXTRA (item 18). Does not need to meet the normal
      requirement (not to exceed 2200 pounds), since item 8 (planned EAR #1 fuel) must be
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                  101


     sufficient meet EAR #2 and AAR #2 abort base fuel requirements. If unidentified extra
     fuel is excessive, consideration should be given to reducing the proposed ramp fuel and
     increasing the proposed AAR on-load, if possible.
  11.6.10. Section III, EAR #1 TO EAR #2.
     11.6.10.1. EN ROUTE (item 20). Time and fuel from EAR #1 to EAR #2. Use the
     planned cruise profile for fuel calculations.
     11.6.10.2. IDENTIFIED EXTRA (item 21) Include 1000 pounds per hour for the time
     anticipated at lower altitude on the track prior to and during actual air refueling for AAR
     #2.
     11.6.10.3. RESERVE (item 23). Ten percent of planned time from EAR #1 to EAR #2,
     not to exceed 0+45. Compute at terminal fuel flow.
     11.6.10.4. FUEL AT EAR #2, NO ONLOAD (item 25). The planned fuel at EAR #1
     minus the fuel required to fly from EAR #1 to EAR #2. This calculated fuel quantity is
     compared to the required fuel at EAR #2 prior to on-load (item 47) to confirm sufficient
     fuel planned through EAR #2.
     11.6.10.5. PLANNED EAR #2 FUEL (item 26). Do not exceed the aircraft maximum
     gross weight limit established in the applicable flight manual.
  11.6.11. Section IV, EAR #2 TO AAR #2 ABORT BASE:
     11.6.11.1. Complete to account for an unsuccessful fuel transfer for AAR #2. An abort
     base is required for all refueling tracks. The designated abort base must meet alternate
     airfield weather requirements. This section is similar to the calculations for Section II,
     EAR #1 to AAR #1 abort base.
     11.6.11.2. RESERVE (item 28). Ten percent of time from EAR #2 to abort base.
     Combined total for item 23 plus item 28 should not exceed 0+45. If the combined total
     exceeds 0+45, add only the balance for a total of 0+45 in this block. Compute at terminal
     fuel flow; entry only required when the flight time from the EAR #2 to abort base
     exceeds 1+30.
     11.6.11.3. PLANNED EAR #1 FUEL (item 34). Must be sufficient to meet the
     requirements of item 35 (REQUIRED EAR #1 FUEL) to satisfy the AAR #2 abort base
     fuel requirements in the event fuel is not on-loaded during AAR #2.
     11.6.11.4. UNIDENTIFIED EXTRA (item 36). Does not need to meet the normal
     requirement (not to exceed 2200 pounds), since item 26 (planned EAR #2 fuel) must be
     sufficient meet EAR #2 to destination and AAR #2 abort base fuel requirements in the
     event of no on-load. If unidentified extra fuel is excessive, consideration should be given
     to reducing the proposed PLANNED EAR #1 fuel (item 8) and increasing the proposed
     AAR #2 on-load, if possible.
  11.6.12. Section V, EAR to DESTINATION (See Figure 11.4 for an example).
     11.6.12.1. Items separated by a diagonal ( / ) in this section are applicable to both single
     and double air refueling missions. The item letter or number after to the diagonal (/)
     applies to double air refueling planning. Use the planned cruise profile for fuel
     calculations.

      11.6.12.2. RESERVE (item 39). Ten percent of time from EAR #2 to destination, not to
      exceed 0+45. Compute at terminal fuel flow.
      11.6.12.3. UNIDENTIFIED EXTRA (item 48). This calculation assumes you receive
      the planned fuel on-load. Subtract fuel required at EAR #2 prior to on-load (item 47)
      from the planned fuel at EAR #2 prior to on-load (item 46). This value equals the extra
      fuel carried or additional fuel required (if negative) at the destination. When negative,
      additional fuel must be, added to the ramp fuel, available from the tanker, or in some
      situations may require moving one or both of the air refueling tracks.

11.7. Flight Charts.
   11.7.1. Maintain a plotting chart showing flight progress on all Category I routes and tactical
   missions. The following information will be shown on the chart:
       11.7.1.1. Navigator’s name and coordinated universal date in the vicinity of departure or
       coast out point. Chart number, and chart edition will be annotated on the back of all
       stripped charts. Check the Chart Updating Manual CHUM on all charts (GNC, JNC,
       etc.). CHUM information is not required on high-level charts.
       11.7.1.2. The flight plan centerlines and portions of ADIZ and FIR boundaries pertinent
       to the route. Label reporting points with proper names or geographical coordinates.
       Place the applicable portion of the “No Fly” line on all charts used for missions flown in
       the vicinity of unfriendly territory or other no-fly areas. Prominently mark warning and
       restricted areas within 25 NM of planned course and 3000 feet of planned altitude on the
       chart (not required if a FLIP en route chart with this information is immediately available
       and used). Annotate airfields along the planned route which could serve as possible
       emergency landing areas. Consider the following factors when selecting emergency
       airfields: type aircraft, weather conditions, runway length, runway weight-bearing
       capacity, runway lighting, radio navigational aids, and proximity to planned flight path.
       11.7.1.3. Fixes or position plots and clearly designated time of each fix or position.
       Fixes or positions may be numbered and the corresponding numbers entered in the
       position column of the log instead of the geographical coordinates or descriptive position.
       11.7.1.4. Annotate the calculated ETP along the route if ETP is required for the mission.
       11.7.1.5. Annotate AAR abort point as described in paragraph 11.2 if applicable for the
       mission.
   11.7.2. In the interest of conservation, re-use flight charts for high level missions whenever
   this would not affect plotting accuracy of fixes or position determination.
   11.7.3. Approved laptop computers running a current version of Falcon View with
   appropriate chart coverage and chart scale may be used for tactical missions instead of paper
   charts. Required paper charts must be available should Falcon View not be accessible.
11.8. In-Flight Procedures.
   11.8.1. Communications & Radios. Monitor the primary command radio unless otherwise
   directed by the aircraft commander. Record ATC clearances and monitor the read back.
   This includes all ATC instructions during departure, en route, and approach. This procedure
   is not required when ATC instructions require immediate execution by the pilot, or when
   such action interferes with the timely performance of other time-sensitive navigator duties.
   11.8.2. Departure and Approach Monitoring. Immediately after takeoff, cross-check
   available flight instruments with the airborne radar to ensure the aircraft remains clear of
   terrain and obstructions. During departure and arrival in IMC with airborne radar
   inoperative, use all available navigational aids to accurately position the aircraft. On all
   departures and arrivals, have the appropriate approach plate open to monitor course, timing,
   and altitude. Backup the pilots and assist as necessary. Report any deviations immediately.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   105


  Assist in clearing for other aircraft when possible. Confine activities to these critical duties
  during all departures and arrivals.
     11.8.2.1. To monitor aircraft on approaches and departures, the navigator will use a
     terrain chart in ONC, TPC, or JOG scale with current CHUM depicting all terrain and
     obstructions within 25 NM of the airfield terminal area.
  11.8.3. Flight Following. The navigator will flight follow on all missions using a suitable
  plotting chart (JNC, JNCA, or GNC). This is not required in the local flying area for
  Category II routes, pilot proficiency sorties, or tactical missions.
  11.8.4. Heading Deviation Checks. Heading deviation checks are not required on Category
  II routes or tactical missions. On Category I routes or route segments of 3 hours or longer,
  compute heading deviation for each compass system as soon as practical after initial level-off
  or coast-out. Record deviations for all compass systems. Use procedures in paragraph
  11.13
     11.8.4.1. On aircraft with reliable single INS or SCNS with a reliable INS, accomplish
     an initial heading deviation check to validate the INS heading. On dual INS equipped
     aircraft, confirm the INS true headings agree within 1 degree of each other. This can be
     accomplished by comparing the airfield diagram runway heading found in the approach
     plate and applying magnetic variation.
     11.8.4.2. A deviation check is not required on flights transiting Category I routes of less
     than 3 hours if: the aircraft is equipped with two or more operable heading systems (the
     standby compass is not considered a system for this requirement) and the difference
     between systems does not exceed 2 degrees.
  11.8.5. True Airspeed (TAS) Checks. TAS checks are not required on Category II routes or
  tactical missions. Compute TAS check on all Category I routes of 3 hours or longer using
  procedures in paragraph 11.14 Compute within 1 hour after reaching the initial cruise
  altitude. Aircraft without an operable or reliable air data computer or transducer will
  accomplish a TAS check after every change in altitude greater than 4,000 feet in addition to
  the initial TAS check.
  11.8.6. In-Flight Fuel Management. Required for each flight over a Category I route when
  the flight time between LSAF and FSAF airfields is 4 hours or more. Record first entry upon
  level-off. Time between level-off entry and next entry may be up to 1 hour and 30 minutes,
  and no more than 1 hour each entry thereafter. Use the in-flight fuel management sections of
  the AF Form 4116 or AF Form 4139 when air-to-air refueling is performed. The navigator
  may terminate these procedures one hour from destination, when the Category I route
  segment is completed, or at the discretion of the Aircraft Commander. See paragraphs
  11.11 and 11.12 for procedures.
     11.8.6.1. Tactical and local training missions. Navigators will calculate a “Bingo” fuel
     that ensures the crew will have enough fuel to leave the operating area and return to the
     recovery airfield with appropriate fuel reserves. If AAR is planned, navigators will
     calculate a fuel requirement that ensures the crew will have enough fuel to leave the
     operating area, travel to and transit the planned AAR track, and return to the
     recovery/divert base with appropriate fuel reserves in the event AAR is unable to be
     completed.
 106                                                         AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


   11.8.7. Fix Interval. Navigators will maintain a flight log on Category I routes of 3 hours or
   longer. Time between recorded fixes/positions will not exceed 1 hour. Navigators will
   periodically record spot readings between recorded fixes/position that include time of
   reading, aircraft heading, drift angle, ground speed, wind data, and TAS. Use procedures in
   paragraph 11.10 Perform associated fix/position plotting on flight chart IAW paragraph
   11.7.1.3
   11.8.8. ETP Calculations. Re-compute the ETP when the actual arrival over any reporting
   point prior to the ETP exceeds 15 minutes ahead or behind time when the change was caused
   by erroneous wind information. If the change was caused by factors other than a change in
   the wind (slower TAS flown than planned, weather deviation, etc.), simply compute a new
   ETA to the ETP, as the ETP itself will not have changed. Follow procedures in paragraph
   11.4
   11.8.9. Immediately report malfunctions or loss of navigational capability which will
   degrade course centerline accuracy to the air traffic control center.
11.9. Laptop Computers. Laptop computers running Falcon View moving map software and
connected to a handheld GPS may be used to provide in-flight situational awareness.
   11.9.1. Laptop computers and handheld GPS will be used IAW AFI 11-202V3.
   11.9.2. Navigators will carry a handheld GPS unit on all Category I route sorties.
   11.9.3. Laptop computers with handheld GPS Falcon View moving map displays will not be
   used as the primary source of navigation.
11.10. Flight Records. Use AF Form 4116, Section I (Flight Data) and Section IX (In-Flight
Data). Record enough detail to reconstruct the mission. Units may publish their standards for
log procedures in the unit supplement. This form will consist of planning and in-flight progress
data. It will be completed in sufficient detail to fully evaluate or reconstruct the flight. See
Figure 11.6 and Figure 11.7 for examples for completed AF Form 4116 Sections I and IX.
   11.10.1. Flight Data. Section I of AF Form 4116 is used to record data for the planned route.
   A CFP with identical flight plan information may be used in lieu of manually entering data in
   Section I. The Flight Data areas are explained below.
       11.10.1.1. Waypoint (WPT). Enter airport or Navigational Aid (NAVAID) identifier,
       waypoint name, or leg number. The level-off line will be labeled as “L/O”. If an
       alternate is required, record this line as “ALT” with flight data from planned recovery
       airfield to alternate airfield.
       11.10.1.2. TO. Enter coordinates for this waypoint.
       11.10.1.3. TAS/ALT. Planned true airspeed and altitude for the leg. Entry not required

     arrival to the point, and amount of time ahead or behind ETA once arriving to the point.
        11.10.1.10.1. Revise ETAs in-flight for unexpected takeoff time, route diversions, or
        unexpected speed changes that cause significant ETA changes.
  11.10.2. In-Flight Data. Section IX of the AF Form 4116 will be used to record present
  positions, spot readings, and construct dead reckoning (DR) plots if necessary. The
  following paragraphs describe each item on the log and procedures for using the log.
     11.10.2.1. Each item is described below.
        11.10.2.1.1. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Time of recorded fix/position or DR
        plot.
        11.10.2.1.2. POS. Position. Use “T/O” for takeoff, “A/H” for altered headings,

108                                                           AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


      11.10.2.2. As soon as practical after level-off or coast-out, whichever occurs latest,
      navigators will verify aircraft position by either navigation aid fix or radar fix.
         11.10.2.2.1. Record the fix in AF Form 4116, Section VIII (Radar/NAVAID Data).
         11.10.2.2.2. At the time of the fix, record the primary navigation solution and
         corresponding deltas for all other navigation solutions in AF Form 4116, Section VI
         (Fix/Computer Position).
         11.10.2.2.3. After the coast-out, record, at a minimum, GMT, present position, true
         heading, spot wind data, TAS, altitude, and ETA to the next waypoint in AF Form
         4116, Section IX (In-Flight Data).
      11.10.2.3. After coast-out, recorded fix/position intervals will be no more than 1 hour
      IAW paragraph 11.8.7
         11.10.2.3.1. Record the GMT, current position of the primary navigation system, true
         heading, spot wind data, TAS, altitude, ETA to the next waypoints, and
         corresponding deltas for all other navigation solutions.
      11.10.2.4. Between recorded fixes/positions, periodically record spot readings at regular
      intervals to allow for calculating a DR plot in the event of a navigation system failure.
      Spot readings will include time of reading, aircraft heading, drift angle, ground speed,
      wind data, and TAS.
      11.10.2.5. As soon as practical prior to coast-in, navigators will verify aircraft position
      by either navigation aid fix or radar fix.
      11.10.2.6. In the event of a navigation system failure (INU or GPS) full log procedures
      will be implemented. Beginning at the last plotted position, compute a DR plot up to the
      present position. Plot a fix/position at a minimum of once per hour. A DR plot
      associated with the fix/position will be plotted on the chart prior to plotting the position.
      If the navigation system failure is resolved, the navigator may resume log procedures as
      outlined in paragraph 11.10.2.
      11.10.2.7. Course Deviations. If deviating from planned course for weather or directed
      by ATC, at a minimum, record the aircraft position and spot data when initially deviating
      from course. Unless other action is required, record this information again at the
      approximate farthest point away from course during deviation prior to returning to
      course.
      11.10.2.8. In Section IX (In-Flight Data) of the AF Form 4116, deviations may be
      recorded as an altered heading line (documented as ―A/H). If unable to maintain log
      due to weather avoidance, the navigator may write ―WEATHER DEVIATIONS on the
      line after the previous recorded fix/position data line. Once clear of weather and heading
      back to planned course or on course, a fix is recommended and the navigator should
      resume normal log work.
      11.10.2.9. Clearance/Remarks. Enter ATC clearances as discussed in paragraph 11.8.1
      When practical, record assigned ATC frequencies on departure and approach in this
      section. Use this section to record other pertinent flight information as required.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                    109


      11.10.2.10. RADAR/NAVAID Data. Use Section VIII of the AF Form 4116. Use this
      section to record actual and corrected readings (if applicable). Compare Doppler, INS,
      SCNS, mission computer (MC), and GPS positions (latitude and longitude, or distance-
      to-go and cross track) for each position fix. At minimum, record the integrated navigation
      solution. If a navigation solution is updated, record its incorrect position and show that it
      was updated (in remarks section). Fix data substantiated by ICAO identifier or
      coordinates in the position block on the actual side of the AF Form 4116 need not be
      duplicated in this section. See Figure 11.5. for an example of this section.

Using the actual in-flight burn rate method will produce an acceptable error, in that projected
current four engine burn rates will lower as gross weight decreases and power is reduced to
maintain a constant TAS. Block entries are as follows:
   11.11.1. ETA DESTINATION. Revised ETA at destination/EAR.
       11.11.1.1. Navigators may use flight plan generated by MCs to update ETAs. Also,
       laptops with current version of PFPS may be used to update ETAs. Navigators should
       update paper log in event either of these options are unavailable.
   11.11.2. TIME. Record the departure time, level off time, and subsequent reading times.
   Time intervals between readings will be done IAW paragraph 11.8.6 Typically, column 1
   will be the take off entry and column 2 will be the level-off entry.
   11.11.3. TERM FUEL FLOW. Terminal Fuel Flow.
   11.11.4. FUEL FLOW. Fuel burn rate at time of reading.
   11.11.5. AVG FUEL FLOW. Calculate by adding TERM FUEL FLOW and FUEL FLOW
   and dividing the sum by 2.
   11.11.6. FUEL REMAINING. Fuel quantity at time of reading.
   11.11.7. MIN DIV/REQ OVHD. Required fuel overhead (item 13 of the AF Form 4116
   Fuel Plan).
   11.11.8. DIFFERENCE. Subtract MIN DIV/REQ OVHD from FUEL REMAINING.
   11.11.9. FUEL ETE. This is the DIFFERENCE converted to time. Calculate by dividing
   DIFFERENCE by AVG FUEL FLOW.
       11.11.9.1. The navigator may choose to calculate FUEL ETE by dividing DIFFERENCE
       by FUEL FLOW (current burn rate) instead of using AVG FUEL FLOW. This will
       produce a more conservative FUEL ETE.
   11.11.10. ETE DESTINATION. Estimated Time En route to destination. Subtract TIME
   from ETA DESTINATION.
   11.11.11. EXTRA TIME. Subtract ETE DESTINATION from FUEL ETE. Report this
   value to the pilot. If this is a negative value, check the computation and values for errors. If
   they are correct, evaluate destination options.

                    FLIGHT ENGINEER PROCEDURES AND FORMS

12.1. General. In addition to the duties listed in the flight manual, other applicable technical
orders, and this instruction, the PIC may assign other duties to the flight engineer, as necessary.
Except for ferry flights, hostile environment repair, and C-130 operations with suspected fuel
tank foam fires these items need not be briefed and will be performed as normal procedures.
12.2. Authority to Clear a Red X. Flight engineers are not normally authorized to clear a Red
X. In a situation where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are
unavailable, the flight engineer may obtain authorization to clear the red X from the home station
LG/CC or designated representative in accordance with T.O. 00-20-1.
   12.2.1. At enroute stations, flight engineers are authorized to sign off Red X symbols for:
   intake/exhaust inspections, dust covers and plugs installed, and aircraft panels removed and
   installed to facilitate other maintenance when away from home station.
   12.2.2. Other crewmembers are not authorized to clear a Red X.
12.3. In-Process Inspections. All flight engineers must be aware of their responsibility to
perform in-process inspections when clearing Red X symbols. During the assembly or
reassembly of an item at those stages where further assembly will prevent the required inspection
of the item, an in-process inspection will be performed.
   12.3.1. Document the in-process inspection. (Refer to T.O. 00-20-1.).
12.4. Aircraft Servicing. Flight engineers normally are not required to refuel or defuel aircraft;
however, the flight engineer is qualified and authorized to accomplish these duties when
maintenance personnel are not available. This policy is designed for support of the aircraft and
its mission while away from home station. TO 00-25-172, and TO 1C-130H-2-12JG-10-1 will
be used during all servicing operations. If ground support personnel are not available, the PIC
will designate other crewmembers to assist the flight engineer.
   12.4.1. Aircraft Refueling. Aircrew members qualified in ground refueling may perform
   refueling duties.
       12.4.1.1. Not used
       12.4.1.2. When crewmembers are required to refuel, the flight engineer will act as the
       refueling team supervisor. Flight engineers acting as refueling supervisors and panel
       operators will comply with T.O. 00-25-172 and applicable C-130 series T.O.s.
   12.4.2. Concurrent Ground Operations. The PIC and Concurrent Servicing Supervisor
   (CSS) shall ensure aircrew members and servicing personnel accomplish Concurrent
   Servicing in accordance with T.O. 00-25-172 and servicing technical orders. Aircrews
   performing Dash-1 preflight inspections or cargo loading concurrent with servicing must
   have cooperation and close coordination with the CSS. The CSS will remain in continuous
   intercom contact with fuel servicing team members during the entire servicing operation. In
   keeping with the guidelines in T.O. 00-25-172, CSS has authority over all phases of CSS
   operations to include personnel participating in the refuel.
 120                                                          AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


       12.4.2.1. Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.
       12.4.2.2. Simultaneous fuel servicing and ammunition loading is not authorized.
   12.4.3. Hot Refueling. Hot refueling (refueling with aircraft engines running) will only be
   conducted by crews that have been authorized and certified according to AFSOC Hot
   Refueling Guide, C-130 Hot Refueling Operations Procedures.
   12.4.4. Fuel Management. In order to comply with the intent of primary fuel management
   and provide the greatest flexibility for maintenance and operations, standard ramp loads in
   excess of 30,000 pounds should be loaded as follows (except fuel burned during start, taxi,
   and takeoff):
       12.4.4.1. Outboard main tanks: 7,500 pounds each is the minimum to be considered full.
       12.4.4.2. Inboard main tanks: 6,900 pounds each is the minimum to be considered full.
       12.4.4.3. Operational commitments, availability of fuel services, or planned landing
       criteria will in some cases, dictate that these procedures be adjusted however, every effort
       should be made to comply with these guidelines and the flight manual to maximize
       airframe life.
12.5. Forms Management. In addition to the procedures in T.O. 00-20-1 and AFI 11-401, the
flight engineer will assist the PIC in maintaining the AFTO Form 781. Verify the exceptional
release is signed before starting engines and resigned, if necessary, at en route stops.
   12.5.1. After each flight, ensure the number of discrepancies (if any), landings, flight
   duration time(s), etc., are entered on the AFTO Form 781H. Review all AFTO Form 781A
   discrepancies and ensure clear, detailed entries are made, symbols, and date discovered, are
   entered for each discrepancy and the discovered blocks are signed.
12.6. Flight monitoring. The flight engineer will monitor aircraft systems during all phases of
flight and ground operations. Notify the PIC of all abnormal indications and take appropriate
action.
   12.6.1. Maintain outside vigilance when flight deck duties allow.
   12.6.2. Monitor the primary radio, interplane radio, interphone systems, and MAIN RCV,
   HOT RCV, P1, and HOT LISTEN (C-130E/H).
   12.6.3. Advise and assist the pilot in maintaining required climb and cruise power.
   12.6.4. State “17,000” over interphone when any engine torque approaches this value.
   NOTE: In the event of an inadvertent over-torque, refer to Table 12.1 Carefully consider
   the over-torque actions criteria in order to determine mission impact.

                       Gearbox may require change if gearbox oil pressure is lower than
                       before over-torque.
 WARNING: Failure to comply with these criteria could result in catastrophic structural
 failure.

 NOTE: The 25-flight hour limit is based on flight time to return the aircraft for maintenance.
 AFSOC aircraft that experience an over-torque over 23,000 in-lbs. are to immediately return
 the aircraft for inspection and required maintenance.
   12.6.5. Notify the pilot when either of the following conditions is noted:
       12.6.5.1. Deviation of more than 200 feet from assigned altitude.
       12.6.5.2. The aircraft configuration is incorrect for the maneuver being performed.
12.7. Prestrike/Post-strike Checklists. When the Prestrike checklist is initiated, ensure the
aircraft is configured to enter the combat environment. When the Post-strike checklist is
initiated, ensure the aircraft is configured properly (tactical environment permitting) for recovery
to the landing airfield.
12.8. Aircraft Performance. Record computed data in accordance with the flight/performance
manual and this instruction. Base all performance data on 95 percent engine efficiency unless
mission requirements dictate otherwise. Calculate an additional torque value based on 100
percent engine efficiency so you can identify the actual efficiency of the engines when setting
takeoff power. Do not accept an engine that produces less than 95 percent efficiency. TOLD
card computations will be accomplished using the appropriate performance manual, approved
tabulated data, or approved Aircraft Performance Calculator (APC). Computed data must equal
or exceed the requirements of this instruction.
   12.8.1. AF Form 4064, C-130 TOLD Card Calculations.
       12.8.1.1. Complete TOLD card for takeoff prior to the BEFORE STARTING ENGINES
       CHECKLIST.
       12.8.1.2. Complete data applicable to the type of takeoff and landing to be made (i.e.,
       landing distance for normal landing).
       12.8.1.3. New data is required for pressure altitude changes of 1,000 feet, gross weight
       changes of 5,000 pounds, or temperature change of 5ºC.
   12.8.2. AF Form 4063, Pilot Information Card Calculations.
       12.8.2.1. The minimum TOLD card requirements for a termination landing are: Air
       Minimum Control Speeds (vMCAs), Obstacle Clearance Speed, 3-Engine Climb Speed,
       100 & 50% Flap Landing Speeds and Distances, 0% Flap Landing Approach Speed
       (Night or IMC), and 3-Engine climb capability (feet per nautical mile).
       12.8.2.2. OGVs may approve overprinting the blank blocks of the AF Form 4063, Pilot
       Information Card (Mini TOLD Card). Submit information copies to HQ AFSOC/A3V
       upon approval.

       12.8.2.3. When practicing no-flap landings, compute both vMCAs for 50 percent flaps
       and for no flap configuration (low rudder boost). Record both sets of speeds on the
       TOLD card.
       12.8.2.4. When cruise time will exceed 4 hours, the flight engineer will post applicable
       cruise data 1 hour after the start of the cruise. Cruise data will be updated hourly.
       Always have 2 and 3 engine service ceiling readily available.
       12.8.2.5. Following initial takeoff and landing recalculate affected speeds if favorable
       conditions afford an additional margin of safety in all other areas (e.g., gross weight
       decreases due to fuel burn off, while pressure altitude and temperature remain constant).

                               LOADMASTER PROCEDURES

13.1. General. In addition to the duties established in applicable TOs and other directives, the
loadmaster will comply with the procedures and duties in this regulation. The PIC may assign
other duties as necessary. NOTE: Aerial gunners who have completed cross-utilization training,
as well as special missions aviation personnel, will comply with the procedures and duties in this
instruction when performing loadmaster duties. The loadmaster will:
   13.1.1. Plan loads; handle troops and passengers; supervise loading, tie-down, and
   offloading of ammunition, cargo, baggage, and mission equipment.
   13.1.2. Perform scanner duties during flight in high threat environments.
   13.1.3. Remain in the cargo compartment/gun deck for takeoffs and landing. When the
   passenger load requires two loadmasters, or a loadmaster and another qualified crewmember,
   then both personnel will remain in the cargo compartment. One will remain forward and one
   aft for takeoffs and landings.
13.2. Additional Aircraft Loadmaster Responsibilities.
   13.2.1. Normally all air freight, fleet service, and servicing personnel are authorized to
   perform assigned duties in all AFSOC aircraft when escorted by an authorized individual.
   Air freight personnel are responsible for completion of cargo documentation, palletizing, and
   movement of cargo to and from the aircraft. They will advise the loadmaster of destination,
   size, weight, and type of cargo (classified, hazardous, etc.) to permit proper positioning;
   coordinate traffic activities that may affect loading and offloading; and assign sufficient air
   freight loading personnel for cargo handling. Air freight personnel are responsible for safe
   positioning of material handling equipment and cargo to and from aircraft cargo ramp or
   auxiliary ground loading ramps. Air freight personnel, under the direction of the loadmaster,
   prepare the aircraft for loading or stowing loading equipment if the aircraft is not to be
   reloaded, tie-down, and physically offload cargo. If cargo, aircraft equipment, or aircraft
   structure are damaged during loading or offloading, or if loading personnel are injured, the
   loadmaster will notify the AC, command post, or terminal operations officer.
   13.2.2. The loadmaster is responsible for aircraft preflight; load planning; preparation of DD
   Form 365-4 operation of aircraft equipment; supervision and direction of loading, offloading,
   tiedown, and coordination with loading crew supervisor for checking the cargo against

Manual.
13.6. Preflight Duties.
   13.6.1. The loadmaster will normally report to the aircraft immediately after the crew
   briefing or as directed by the aircraft commander to begin preflight and loading duties.
   13.6.2. AFSOC BAI C-130E/H aircraft do not routinely airlift channel cargo; however, if so
   tasked, contact the air terminal operations center (ATOC), airlift control element, or air
   freight/passenger service to obtain the cargo and passenger breakdown and assist in planning
   of proposed load. Security requirements for ammunition and weapons will be briefed to the
   loadmaster during the initial load briefing at ATOC.
       13.6.2.1. AC-130s will not normally accept airlift channel cargo; however, floor loaded
       cargo may be transported to support AFSOC aircraft. Under no circumstances will an
       AC-130 be reconfigured while off station to accommodate cargo airlift.
       13.6.2.2. At stations where aircraft tiedown equipment is exchanged, make every effort
       to ensure that a one-for-one exchange occurs. If this is not possible, the loadmaster will
       inform the aircraft commander of lost or missing equipment, make an AFTO Form 781
       entry for the discrepancy and annotate missing items on the AFSOC Form 31, Aircraft -

will passengers be manifested or loaded aboard AFSOC aircraft without the prior approval of the
aircraft/mission commander. If tasked to transport passengers, comply with the following
procedures and paragraph 6.29
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                 125


   13.7.1. Passenger Handling. The loadmaster is the key figure concerning good passenger
   relations. Be aware of the doubts and fears which may arise in the minds of passengers and
   anticipate their questions and actions. Passenger movement should be limited to
   physiological needs. Good judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed
   out of their seats at one time. Encourage passengers to keep seat belts fastened when seated.
   13.7.2. Do not allow passengers to lounge on or tamper with equipment, cargo, or baggage.
   13.7.3. Ensure that non-mission-essential classified equipment remains covered during the
   entire mission when passengers are onboard and ensure they are denied access to this
   equipment. If troops require access to classified equipment, the requirement should be made
   known to the aircraft commander prior to the mission.
   13.7.4. The loadmaster(s) will give one copy of the manifest to the PIC for filing with the
   flight plan and retain sufficient copies for border clearance. The loadmaster will complete
   anti-hijacking requirements IAW this instruction.
   13.7.5. Most personnel carried aboard AFSOC aircraft are aboard to perform a specific
   mission. Every effort should be made to advise them of mission progress and deviations.
   The troop commander should be identified prior to boarding.

border clearance. The loadmaster will ensure that required forms are contained in the aircraft
mission kit. Distribute the forms to the crew and ensure their completion prior to landing;
deliver them to the proper persons. Also comply with the requirements of this instruction.
13.11. Weight and Balance. Accomplish weight and balance for the aircraft IAW T.O. 1-1B-
50, Weight and Balance, and this instruction. A basic handbook of weight and balance, T.O. 1-
1B-50, Weight and Balance Data, containing current aircraft status, is maintained by the unit
possessing the aircraft which provides a supplemental weight and balance handbook for each
aircraft. This supplemental handbook is in a wear-resistant binder and may not contain T.O. 1-
1B-50 if a certified copy of Chart C provides the current basic weight, basic moment, and basic
index. The binder will include the applicable T.O. 1C-130X-5, Basic Weight Checklist and
Loading Data, and sufficient copies of DD Form 365-4. Also maintain AFSOCI 11-203V5 or
V6, Configuration / Mission Planning Instruction or AFI 11-2C-130V3-Addenda A, as
appropriate, in each binder.
   13.11.1. Compute weight and balance by using the Chart E mathematical (moments)
   method. Prepare DD Form 365-4 IAW applicable Configuration/Mission Planning

   13.11.2. The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the aircraft is responsible for
   providing the appropriate agency with information required to keep documents current and
   accurate.
13.12. Fuel Weight Computation. To compute fuel weight entered on the DD Form 365-4,
read directly from each gauge and compute the sum for total fuel weight. Compute limiting
wing fuel computations using the charts in the appropriate Dash One or Configuration/Mission
Planning Instruction.
13.13. AC-130 Cargo/Baggage Airlift. When loading items on the ramp, ensure the latrine
area remains clear and ramp egress is available.
   13.13.1. AC-130H cargo/baggage may be floor loaded in the following locations: between
   the number 5 and 6 guns, cargo ramp, and wheel well.
       13.13.1.1. Route tiedown straps over and around the 105 millimeter (MM) and secure
       them to the 40 MM or the floor tiedown ring forward of the number 5 gun. Ensure
       tiedown straps do not rest on, or crimp any electrical/hydraulic lines.
   13.13.2. AC-130U cargo/baggage may be floor loaded in the following locations: crew rest
   compartment, wheel well, between the number 2 and 3 guns, above the 40/105 MM
   Ammunition Storage and Handling System (ASHS), and cargo ramp.
13.14. Pyrotechnics.
   13.14.1. This section provides information in preparation for launching pyrotechnics.
   Reference: T.O.s 11A10-25-7, Storage and Maintenance Procedures – Pyrotechnic
   Markers, and 11A10-26-7, Storage and Maintenance Procedures – Pyrotechnic Signals.
   13.14.2. Hazards. In general, pyrotechnics contain materials of a hazardous nature. Even
   though each of the ingredients in a pyrotechnic composition may be relatively stable within
   itself, it may react with one or more of the other materials to cause deterioration and create an
   even greater hazard. Pyrotechnics are more dangerous than many other types of ammunition
   because they are more easily activated. These items should not be handled roughly or
   exposed to moisture. When subjected to fire, most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat.
       13.14.2.1. Toxic Hazards. Many chemicals used in pyrotechnic devices are poisonous if
       taken internally. This also applies to the residues of burned pyrotechnics. From the
       inhalation standpoint, the products of pyrotechnic devices and smoke generators present a
       serious problem. Although most of the smoke and fumes given off by pyrotechnics are
       considered non-toxic, heavy concentrations in closely confined spaces are dangerous and
       may be lethal, as they reduce the amount of available oxygen in the air.
   13.14.3. Handling. Besides the hazardous basic compositions, pyrotechnics contain
   sensitive elements such as fuses, friction compositions, and primers. Pyrotechnics should be
   handled with care and protected against moisture, shock, friction, or heat. Care should be
   taken to avoid premature ignition or damage that may cause failure when fired. Boxes
   containing pyrotechnics should not be dropped or thrown. Protective or safety devices
   should not be removed until just before use. Care should be taken to avoid damage to fiber
   cases and rip cords located outside the casing of flares. Pyrotechnics should be handled so as
   to avoid denting or deforming the barrel or case. Do not use pyrotechnics which are dented,
   deformed, cracked, broken, or have signs of advanced rust, or have shipping covers with an
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   127


  illegible lot number, manufacture date, or other required identifying information.
  Pyrotechnics will be handled only under the supervision of a competent, qualified person.
  Most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat; therefore, personnel should be adequately prepared
  to handle an emergency situation (e.g., heat resistant gloves and broom).
  13.14.4. Storage. Units which have a requirement for storing pyrotechnics will obtain a
  license from the host base.
  13.14.5. Issue Procedures. Pyrotechnics which have been issued for training purposes will
  be marked in bold capital letters with the word TRAINING. These pyrotechnics will always
  be stored separately from operational stock within storage areas.
  13.14.6. Safety. All of the pyrotechnics described contain combustible chemicals which,
  when ignited, generate a flame or smoke (or combination of both) for a broad variety of
  purposes. These purposes include visual signaling, area or target illumination, and point
  marking. Most are intended to burn with intense heat.
     13.14.6.1. Initiation Mechanism. Pyrotechnic devices normally are equipped with some
     type of safety pin, lock, or tape designed to prevent accidental activation of the initiation
     mechanism. Any pyrotechnic that shows sign of damage to safety features is considered
     unserviceable and must be carefully segregated for prompt disposition by EOD.
     13.14.6.2. Accidental Initiation. If a pyrotechnic device should be accidentally ignited,
     in all cases its functioning will result in a fire hazard. The gases generated by this
     combustion could present a serious toxic hazard. Signaling devices containing propellant
     charges create an extremely dangerous missile hazard if accidentally ignited.
     13.14.6.3. Fighting Pyrotechnic Fires. Pyrotechnic compositions characteristically
     contain their own oxidants, and therefore do not depend upon atmospheric oxygen for
     combustion. For this reason, excluding air from a pyrotechnic fire usually is ineffective.
     Many pyrotechnic mixtures, particularly illuminating flare compositions, burn with
     intense heat up to 4,500 degrees F. Normally, available extinguishers are of little or no
     value in fires of this kind, and in addition, may produce toxic or poisonous gases.
     13.14.6.4. Safe Altitudes and Distances. Flares not entirely burned out and cooled when
     they land may ignite combustible material. Safe altitudes and distances depend upon the
     burning time, rate of descent, and drift of the flare. Such factors will be considered in
     determining minimum altitudes and distances of release. Signal flares are also a potential
     fire hazard when the parachute fails to support the signal properly. CAUTION: Flares
     will not be launched over areas subject to fire except in an extreme emergency. If such
     an emergency exists, flares should be dropped from sufficient altitude to allow complete
     burnout before hitting the surface.
     13.14.6.5. Reporting Instructions. Prepare instructions for mishaps, accidents, and
     incidents IAW AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports. Prepare unsatisfactory
     reports IAW TO 00-35D-54, USAF Material Deficiency Reporting and Investigating
     System.
  13.14.7. Launching Instructions. Gunship jettison locations are determined by the type of
  pyrotechnic launched.
128                                                           AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


      13.14.7.1. Personnel launching pyrotechnics through open doors or hatches will wear a
      restraint harness (secured to the aircraft) or parachute, and will have heat resistant gloves
      and a broom or wood stick readily available in case of fire. Nomex gloves will be worn
      when deploying pyrotechnics.
  13.14.8. Pyrotechnics Description and Operation:
      13.14.8.1. MK-6 MOD 3; Signal, Smoke, and Illumination, Aircraft:
         13.14.8.1.1. Description. This signal marker provides long burning (approximately
         40 minutes) surface smoke and illumination for day or night use. It is used to mark
         sightings at sea, make sea evaluations, marking a sea lane for night water landing, and
         to simulate targets for the firing of weapons. It may be used to provide smoke on
         land surfaces if a fire hazard does not exist.
         13.14.8.1.2. Operation. Prior to launching the signal marker, remove the adhesive
         tape covering the pull ring. WARNING: The smoke signal has a 90 second ignition
         delay and must be launched immediately after the igniter has been actuated.
         WARNING: Packaged signal markers dropped in excess of 10 feet or unpacked
         signals dropped in excess of 5 feet shall be considered unserviceable. NOTE: Do not
         remove the four square patches of adhesive tape covering the metal caps in the holes
         from which flame and smoke issue after ignition of the candle. At the time the signal
         is launched, the pull-type igniter is actuated by hand.
      13.14.8.2. MK 6 Launch Preparation Procedures. Prepare the signal marker only after
      the pilot has given clearance to arm the guns. Position two MK 6 markers near the
      jettison location and pull back the protective tape to expose the pull ring. Leave tape
      partially attached to marker to allow replacement of the tape if marker is not required.
      WARNING: Do not prepare more than 2 marks at a time and do not remove more than 4
      marks at a time from the storage container in flight. WARNING: Jettison MK 6 markers
      from the aft scanner bubble (AC-130H only), aft cargo door, or right paratroop door. At
      no time will any object be jettisoned out of any other location.
      13.14.8.3. MK-25 MOD 3; Marker, Location Marine:
         13.14.8.3.1. Description. This marker was designed for day or night use for all
         surface reference point marking purposes. It emits white smoke and yellow flame for
         13 to 18 minutes.
         13.14.8.3.2. Operation. To activate the marker, the base plate must be rotated from
         the safe to the armed position to allow the battery cavity ports to be opened. The
         ports are opened by pressing the two brass colored port plugs into the battery cavity
         using the thumb and forefinger. A one-pound force is required for plug removal.
         This device is considered to be a sealed unit until its base plugs (one or both) have
         been pushed in. Do Not push in the port plugs until immediately prior to jettisoning
         the mark. If a MK 25 must be retained inside the aircraft and the port plugs have not
         been pushed in, rotate the base plate to the safe position and return it to its package.
         The MK 25 will not be retained inside the aircraft after the port plugs have been
         pushed in. WARNING: The nose end of this marker must be kept out of line with
         the body or with other personnel at all times. If marker is initiated, the nose plug is
         expelled with considerable force creating a missile hazard.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                129


         13.14.8.3.3. Special Precautions. This marker may be converted for use in fresh
         water by adding one tablespoon of table salt through the base plugs. Only press in
         one port plug when adding salt. WARNING: Personnel launching MK 25 markers
         with salt added will wear a helmet with the visor down. WARNING: Converted
         markers must be used after adding salt. They must not be returned to storage. If not
         used, they must be jettisoned in flight, over water. WARNING: Be sure salt is not
         exposed to moisture before and during the conversion process, as moist salt may
         cause marker to ignite. CAUTION: Packaged flares dropped in excess of 6 feet or
         unpacked flares dropped in excess of 3 feet shall be considered unserviceable.
         NOTE: Converted markers will not perform as reliably in fresh water as unconverted
         markers in sea water.
         13.14.8.3.4. MK 25 Launch Preparation Procedures. Position two MK 25 markers
         near the jettison location. WARNING: Do not remove more than 4 marks at a time
         from the storage container. WARNING: There is no electrical interrupt in the
         battery of the MK 25. The battery may activate when exposed to salt laden moisture
         in the least amount (i.e., sweat, moist salt air). Do not push in the port plugs until
         immediately prior to jettisoning the mark. The MK 25 will not be retained inside the
         aircraft after rotating the base plate from the SAFE position and pushing the port
         plugs in. WARNING: Jettison MK 25 markers only from the following locations:
         AC-130H – right troop door/jettison port, aft scanner bubble, or aft cargo door; AC-
         130U – Ammunition jettison port, right troop door, or aft cargo door. At no time will
         any object be jettisoned out of any other location.
  13.14.9. All marks will be launched on command of the pilot using the procedures described
  in Chapter 18.

AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   137


   performed with the approval of the mission commander and under the supervision of the lead
   gunner.
   15.10.2. The lead gunner will ensure all munitions have been expended and are free of
   explosives prior to returning to aircraft parking.
15.11. AC-130 Lanyard Firing. Lanyard firing of the 40MM and 105MM, much like manual
firing, has inherent risks with decreased safety margins. Lanyard firing may be utilized for
specified employment situations when normal modes of fire are not available. The crew will
thoroughly brief procedures prior to any lanyard firing. For pre-planned lanyard firing training,
procedures will be reviewed during the pre-mission crew brief.
   15.11.1. Specified Lanyard Fire Missions. Lanyard fire may be used for all
   contingency/combat missions and directed missions such as multi-lateral exercises, joint
   readiness exercises, ORI, etc. During training missions lanyard fire may be used, at the
   discretion of the aircraft commander, to meet syllabus requirements, familiarize
   crewmembers with procedures, or ensure crew proficiency. If lanyard fire is the only method
   available due to electrical firing malfunction, crews will fire the minimum number of rounds
   required to meet mission objectives and then return the weapon for maintenance.
   WARNING: Failure to properly execute lanyard firing can result in loss of life or injury to
   ground personnel, and/or off-range expenditures.
   15.11.2. If in the opinion of the lead gun this procedure cannot be safely accomplished, the
   lead gun will notify the pilot. The following factors should be considered, but are not limited
   to: crew experience levels, cargo compartment lighting, student training, other weapons
   malfunctions, air turbulence, and time available.
   15.11.3. The 40MM/105MM guns will be minimum safe prior to removing the firing rod or
   attaching the lanyard. (40MM – remove the firing rod pin and then remove the firing rod).
   15.11.4. The lead gunner will ensure the following is briefed and accomplished prior to
   lanyard/manual firing:
       15.11.4.1. The pilot will NOT depress the trigger on the yoke.
       15.11.4.2. The flight engineer’s Gun Select switch and the aerial gunner’s Arm/Safe
       switch will be set to SAFE for the affected gun.
       15.11.4.3. 105MM: A “Gun Ready” call from the gunners and flight engineer will be
       made as in other modes of fire. 40MM calls will be conducted as briefed by the lead
       gunner.
       15.11.4.4. The pilot will state: “Give me number __ gun, trainable (or fixed), lanyard
       fire”.
       15.11.4.5. The FCO will state: “FCO is ready”.
       15.11.4.6. The navigator will state: “Nav confirms, cleared to fire”.
       15.11.4.7. The primary sensor operator will state:          “Infrared Sensor Operator
       (IR)/Television Sensor Operator (TV)/Radar is tracking”. WARNING: The gun being
       lanyard-fired must be within the trainable envelope (Trainable / Auto-Trainable mode) or
       the pilot must meet the proper conditions of rate and coincidence (all Fixed modes)
       before the “Ready, Ready, Fire” call is made.
138                                                       AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


      15.11.4.8. In the Trainable mode of fire, a “Ready, Ready, Fire” call will be made over
      main interphone by the pilot or sensor operator. In the Fixed mode of fire, a “Ready,
      Ready, Fire” call will be made over main interphone by the pilot. WARNING: If the
      sensor operator drops consent or any crewmember identifies an unsafe condition, they
      will call “CEASE FIRE”. NOTE: The gunner working the LWCP will control gun
      operation and pull the 105MM lanyard/actuate the 40MM firing mechanism.
      15.11.4.9. Crews will coordinate the number of rounds to be fired. Lanyard fire in dual
      target attack and 40MM rapid fire are prohibited (EXCEPTION: Combat/Contingency
      Operations). WARNING: Do not load or fire the 105 MM in moderate or greater
      turbulence.

                           SENSOR OPERATOR PROCEDURES

Section 16A— General Information

16.1. General. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss factors common to all gunship missions
for sensor operators. Professional knowledge, expertise, and common sense remain key factors
in the sensor operator’s ability to make in-flight decisions that produce success. Technological
devices, basic skill, ingenuity, and adaptability supplement standardized procedures. These
procedures are directive and apply to all sensor operators assigned to AC-130 aircraft.
16.2. Mission Planning. During mission planning, the sensor operators will cover all elements
and details of the mission to be flown. The following are tasks sensor operators will normally
perform during mission planning.
   16.2.1. Analyze Mission Tasking. Sensor operators will plot the target(s) and become
   thoroughly familiar with the time frame for mission execution, to include any operational
   restrictions.
   16.2.2. Analyze Intelligence Data. Analyze intelligence data to determine the order of battle
   while gathering specific information on the targets and threats in the area of operations.
   16.2.3. Target Study. The function of target study is to use assigned charts, maps, and
   imagery to determine the location of threats and targets. Positive target identification is
   made by using confirmation points depicted on the charts and imagery in coordination with
   the crew.
   16.2.4. Sensor operators will ensure there is sufficient video recording media available for
   the mission and coordinate with the crew on media replacement procedures.
   16.2.5. During mission planning, the sensor operator (when applicable) will coordinate the
   use of the laser illuminators and the laser designator range finder with the crew.

Section 16B— Basic Mission Profile

16.3. Enroute. Sensor operators will check and confirm targets, friendly positions, and threat
coordinates prior to reaching the target area. All data entered prior to entering the area will be
checked in order to identify any errors. Enroute to the target, the sensor operators will study the
target area, and assist with terrain and traffic avoidance as required. At all times the sensor
operators will monitor all controlling agencies for time-sensitive/additional target, friendly, and
threat positions. One or both sensor operators will verify these positions, as they are relayed to
the aircraft.
16.4. Prestrike. Complete all equipment checks, check/set Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF)
codes as required and set up Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) recorders. (AC-130U) Sensor
operators will properly configure their dedicated Tactical Situation Map (TSM) for the upcoming
mission.
16.5. Strike Operations.
 140                                                             AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


   16.5.1. Impacts. While shooting, the primary sensor will normally call all observed round
   impacts over MAIN or P2 interphone. If an impact is not observed a “NO JOY” call will be
   made. Any other sensor observing the impact will make a shot call, if not they will also
   make a “NO JOY” call. (AC-130U) When the navigator is firing with the APQ-180, the IR
   and TV sensor operators will be prepared to make shot calls if the impact is observed through
   the weather.
   16.5.2. Offset. When using offset, the primary sensor operator tracks the friendlies or
   ground reference. Crewmembers will verify offset is displayed and observe the Sensor
   Angle Displays (SADs) on their displays. If an offset is being used for firing, the primary
   sensor SAD indicators in azimuth and elevation will be different from that normally used for
   direct firing. If the secondary sensor can visually identify the offset point, request to switch
   to direct fire.
   16.5.3. Target Acquisition/Identification. The sensor operator(s) conduct target acquisition/
   identification in conjunction with the navigator (NAV)/FCO and other sensor operator and
   track the target if made primary. The other sensor(s) will continue to search the area and
   continually back up the primary sensor.
       16.5.3.1. The primary sensor operator will track the target or position. Update the pilot
       and FCO of changes in target tracking and movement. When firing in the fixed mode of
       fire drop consent and notify the Pilot before moving or reacquiring a new target outside
       the narrow field of view. In the trainable mode of fire, track the target and fire the
       weapon when cleared, assessing ordnance impacts.
       16.5.3.2. The secondary sensor will also confirm the target the primary sensor is
       tracking, notifying the crew if they do not confirm it as the target. Search for additional
       targets, threats, or ground team(s) as required. Back up the primary sensor operator on
       shot calls, target ID, acquiring new targets, maintaining orientation, and aid the
       NAV/FCO as required.
16.6. Post-strike and Post mission. The post-strike phase of the mission begins at the combat
exit point. Once the aircraft has departed the working area the sensor operators will complete all
appropriate checklists IAW the flight manual. They will also collect all classified material as
required, then prepare for the intelligence debrief upon landing. Sensor operators will fill out the
sensor status form at the completion of the mission. One copy will be filed in the sensor status
book, and the other will be given or faxed to sensor maintenance.

Section 16C—Sensor Operator Techniques

16.7. Visual Queues. The IR and TV wide fields-of-view are for general orientation such as
locating major terrain features and road patterns. Search in the forward half of the look angle,
and use an up and down search pattern to find lines of communication (LOC)’s or targets. After
locating an LOC, search along and either side of it. Even though the LOC itself may not be
distinctly visible, look for identifying features such as trails, vegetation, rivers, streams, valleys,
or other geographic references. Search closely in areas with such indicators. Notify the
navigator when abeam of or passing prominent landmarks or reference points. Keep the
navigator informed regarding the distance from roads, rivers, streambeds, or areas to be
searched. Give direction to the pilot or guide the aircraft into orbit when necessary. Cross-
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                  141


reference with the other sensor operator for aid in searching all areas. Targets should be
identified by the use of more than one sensor, and also from different parts of the orbit.
   16.7.1. If the target is moving, immediately notify the pilot of the direction in which it is
   moving (i.e., Parallel Forward/Aft or Perpendicular Towards/Away, continue to advise the
   pilot unless directed otherwise) so the pilot can make an adjustment to the firing geometry to
   compensate for this movement. Sensor guidance and/or direction will be given to the pilot to
   reduce the possibility of losing the target.
      16.7.1.1. When attacking a moving vehicle without moving target mode, the sensor
      operator should maintain a point on the LOC well in front of the oncoming target.
      Generally, the sensor operator can estimate this point by holding a stationary point and
      determining the distance traveled by the vehicle for the time period equal to the time of
      fall for the ordnance being used. The operator can then lead the vehicle accordingly. A
      single round of 105 MM or 40 MM fired in front of the vehicle may cause the vehicle to
      stop and allow use of stationary tactics.
      16.7.1.2. To compensate for the movement of the vehicle, AC-130H/U aircraft are
      equipped with a moving target mode of operation. In this mode, the MC will
      automatically compensate for the vehicle movement. This mode only works on straight
      LOC’s. If the target becomes stationary, ensure FCO selects stationary mode of fire and
      track direct.

                        FIRE CONTROL OFFICER PROCEDURES

17.1. General. This section provides the FCO with supplemental information and procedures
not covered in existing T.O.s. that have not migrated to AFTTP 3-3.AC-130. These procedures
are directive and apply to all FCOs assigned to AC-130 aircraft. Currently all procedures have
moved to other areas of this instruction. Chapter 17 will be maintained for future development
of FCO procedures.
17.2. Gun Settings. AC-130 guns require a depression angle below the aircraft lateral axis and
a lag angle aft of the lateral axis for ordnance to impact the target from the standard circular
firing geometry. Gun Depression Angle (GDA) is primarily determined by aircraft altitude above
the ground and aircraft bank angle. Gun Lag Angle (GLA) is primarily determined by true
airspeed. There is a geometric interaction between GDA and GLA that causes slight corrections
to be made to the basic angles. These corrections are generally of minor significance and do not
add to an understanding of the primary factors involved. Other secondary corrections such as
muzzle velocity are added to these angles for additional ballistic effects. On a stable aircraft
platform, if the gun settings are varied, the ordnance impact point will vary in direct proportion
to the change in gun settings. The guns may be set for various firing altitudes based on effective
range and are also restricted by aircraft structural limitations.

                                   AC-130 EMPLOYMENT

18.1. General. This chapter provides guidance for the employment of the AC-130 Gunship. In
order for the gunship to operate effectively, employment tactics must remain compatible with the
combat environment. All crewmembers must actively participate in keeping tactics and
publications up to date. Submit proposed publications changes to HQ AFSOC/A3V IAW this
instruction. Submit proposed tactics changes to HQ AFSOC/A3TW.
   18.1.1. Employment Decisions. The aircraft commander is the decision authority on tactics
   and employment. They are responsible for risk assessment and mission execution. Select
   weapons and munitions prior to flight whenever possible. This is not intended to limit
   flexibility, but to reduce task loading in the employment area.
18.2. Publications. Joint terminology will be used for mission planning and execution.
   18.2.1. Gunship crewmembers will have a working knowledge of the information contained
   in the following Joint Publications (JP) Library, Volume 3-series: JP 3-03, Doctrine for Joint
   Interdiction Operations; JP 3-09.1, Joint Laser Designation Procedures; JP 3-09.2, Joint
   Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Ground Radar Beacon Operations (J-Beacon); JP
   3-09.3, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Close Air Support (CAS); JP 3-10.1,
   Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Base Defense.
   18.2.2. The Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness Special
   Operations Working Group is used by the crew as a reference during mission planning for;
   target description, damage criteria, type of rounds to use, target vulnerability, hit/aim points,
   and weapons effectiveness.
   18.2.3. Air Force Tactics Techniques and Procedures. The AFTTP 3-1 has several volumes
   for the different weapon systems and threats encountered by USAF aircrews. It gives
   information on general planning and employment considerations, threat reference and
   counter tactics, and individual weapon system employment guides.
   18.2.4. AFTTP 3-1 Volume 1, General Planning and Employment Consideration. All
   aircrew will possess a working knowledge of Special Operations chapters found in V1,
   AFTTP 3-1V2, Threat Reference Guide and Considerations, and the specific aircraft volume
   AFTTP 3-1.AC-130, Tactical Employment, AC-130.
18.3. Critical Information. AC-130 crewmembers must not divulge sensitive information to
persons who do not have a need to know. This includes private conversations and discussions
over non-secure telephone lines. Attachment 2 lists this critical information.
   18.3.1. Control of Classified Information and Materials. It is the responsibility of every
   crewmember to control the classified material they use. This includes maps/charts with
   target coordinates, friendly positions, battle lines, or threat positions drawn on them. Most
   imagery, target lists, Command Electronic Operating Instruction (CEOI), SPINS, Rules of
   Engagement (ROE), and strike data are classified and must be controlled and handled as
   such. Imagery from the sensor systems that has been recorded must be handled IAW the
   aircraft security classification guide.
 144                                                         AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


18.4. Gunfire Modes. The AC-130H and AC-130U gunfire modes are covered in their
respective flight manuals. Mode selection during employment will be determined by: tactical
considerations, crew preference, and subsystem availability. WARNING: When firing in the
trainable mode, the primary sensor must ensure the consent switch is off unless tracking the
target and attempting to fire the weapon. WARNING: AC-130H. Constant consent is given
when the beacon tracking radar (APQ-150) is locked on a ground beacon or when INS is selected
as primary and consent is selected by the navigator.
   18.4.1. AC-130H Restrictions. Crews will not shoot in IMC with ground personnel in
   peacetime. During training missions when live offsets are performed with the primary sensor
   tracking the ground party, the FCO will enable a safety circle of at least 500 meters. The
   navigator will confirm that the offset is in. Use caution when firing off a surface beacon.
   WARNING: When firing in offset mode, ensure the offset is to the correct position. Failure
   to heed this warning could cause injury or death to friendly ground forces. “Accomplish this
   by all means available.” WARNING: For training missions, use extreme caution when
   using the ground party as a reference point for offset firing.
       18.4.1.1. When using the INS as the reference for the offset, the GPS will be integrated
       into the Kalman filter position. (AC-130H) MC circular error of probability will be 0.02
       or less. WARNING: When firing in the Trainable mode with Offset enabled, the pilot
       will not give consent until a “FCO READY” call is made, and the NAV confirms the
       target. If using the visual sensor, the sensor operator will give constant consent and the
       pilot will not depress the trigger until the "FCO READY" call is made and the NAV
       confirms the target.
18.5. AC-130U Radar. The APQ-180 radar gives the AC-130U an all-weather capability to fire
against radar significant targets as well as a beacon offset capability.
   18.5.1. Optimum high-resolution mapping requires the aircraft to be offset 20º or greater
   from the heading inbound to the target. Ideally the aircraft should be offset to the right to
   facilitate entering geometry. WARNING: The APQ-180 radar must be in WHX or RBGM
   and the Projectile Impact Point Prediction (PIPP) must be off during all training expenditures
   of M732/M732A2 or FMU-160 fused munitions.
   18.5.2. Use projectile impact point prediction PIPP to tweak the appropriate weapons to the
   radar. Compare PIPP values with the visual sensors and note any discrepancies.
       18.5.2.1. If the radar and weapon combinations have been tweaked, PIPP may be off for
       maximum ordnance delivery. PIPP can be selected for subsequent shots to check for
       accuracy.
   18.5.3. The navigator should consent when fixed target track has a valid track indication and
   an azimuth and elevation bias of less than or equal to 1.
18.6. AC-130H Beacon Tracking Radar or Mission Computer in IMC. The APQ-150
beacon tracking radar or MC gives the AC-130H a limited all-weather capability. WARNING:
AC-130H. Constant consent is given when the beacon tracking radar (APQ-150) is locked on a
ground beacon or when INS is selected as primary and consent is selected by the navigator.
   18.6.1. (Contingency/combat use only) The primary firing mode in IMC or unable to see
   the target will be direct trainable with the INS selected as the primary sensor.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                       145


   18.6.2. The offset mode can be used to derive a position to allow gunfire in the direct mode.
   The direct mode is the primary and preferred mode of fire; adjustments can be made by
   updating coordinates or offsetting from the INS.
18.7. Munitions. Information on specific munitions and targets is contained in            AFTTP 3-
3.AC-130.
   18.7.1. Round Jettison Procedures. The procedures in this paragraph apply to training
   missions and will serve as a baseline for contingency operations over established impact
   areas. The OG/CC or equivalent with OPCON holds waiver authority for these procedures,
   as well as authority for local supplementary procedures.
       18.7.1.1. These procedures are intended for use in VMC, but may be used in the absence
       of IMC procedures if VMC cannot be maintained. Range-specific IMC procedures will
       be used if applicable. Jettison the round over the range in use or the nearest suitable
       impact area. In an emergency, jettison the round over an uninhabited area, immediately
       mark and relay the aircraft and round position to the applicable range controlling agency
       and C2 element (following procedures for an off-range expenditure).
          18.7.1.1.1. Deleted.
       18.7.1.2. Round jettison procedures will not be performed on training missions until all
       ground parties have departed the impact and ricochet areas. Standard round jettison
       altitude will be 3,000 feet AGL or IAW local range procedures. On water ranges, the
       normal firing orbit/altitude may be used for round jettison. Ensure the surface area is
       cleared by at least 5 nm.
          18.7.1.2.1. Deleted.
          18.7.1.2.2. Deleted.
          18.7.1.2.3. Deleted.
          18.7.1.2.4. Deleted.
          18.7.1.2.5. Deleted.
       18.7.1.3. Orbit the center of the impact area and attempt to keep the gun pointing in the
       center of the impact area until level at jettison altitude. Nominals will be updated during
       descent to maintain useful geometry (Exception: AC-130U crews may update nominals at
       their discretion). Once level at jettison altitude with the jettison area clear, the pilot will
       direct the crew to initiate round jettison procedures IAW the following sub-paragraphs
       and applicable local procedures.
          18.7.1.3.1. The gunners will complete their emergency procedures up to, but not
          including, extracting the round.
          18.7.1.3.2. Once the gunner is ready to extract the round, the navigator will begin a
          descending 40-second countdown (in 5-second increments) when the aircraft heading
          passes the heading that allows the round to impact the center of the desired impact
          area. The intent is to jettison the round at the end of the 40-second countdown.
          18.7.1.3.3. (AC-130H) The gun should remain trainable, slaved and tracking the
          center of the impact area during descent to maximize the chances of an inadvertent
146                                                          AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


         discharge impacting the center of the impact area. Once level and when directed, the
         FCO will fix the position of the respective gun and clear the gunners to select OFF for
         the 40mm gun. Rounds will be jettisoned through the jettison port, or the
         loadmaster’s bubble. Crew members will wear appropriate restraining devices or
         parachutes when the bubble is open.
         18.7.1.3.4. (AC-130U) The gun should remain fixed during the descent to ensure it
         remains within the firing envelope. Once level and when directed by the pilot, the
         FCO will select a non-wind corrected orbit and ensure FXD on the respective gun.
         The gunners will not select MANUAL for the 40mm gun until cleared by the pilot.
         Rounds will be jettisoned through the round jettison port. The TSM should be used
         with range corners displayed for position awareness. The gunner jettisoning the
         round will state “ROUND AWAY” on CALL and the navigator will mark the
         aircraft/round position.
         18.7.1.3.5. If the round cannot be extracted within 15 seconds past the end of the
         countdown, continue the orbit and attempt once more before recovering with a hot
         gun. WARNING: At no time will an extracted round be retained in the aircraft for
         another orbit.
  18.7.2. Hot Gun/Jammed Gun Procedures. These procedures will be used any time a gun
  contains a round that cannot be removed in flight.
      18.7.2.1. Hot Gun. If, in the opinion of the lead gun, any probability for an inadvertent
      firing exists and the gun cannot be mechanically and electrically safed, the live fire will
      be terminated and the following procedures will be used:
         18.7.2.1.1. Notify appropriate controlling agencies of the hot gun condition and
         declare an emergency.
         18.7.2.1.2. Return to recovery airfield using approved hot gun routes and avoid
         bringing the guns to bear on any populated areas. The lead gunner will monitor the
         malfunctioning gun and select STOW/isolate hydraulics immediately prior to
         completion of before landing checklist.
         18.7.2.1.3. Hot Gun parking will be IAW recovery airfield restrictions. Aircrew
         withdrawal distance is 400 feet.
      18.7.2.2. Jammed Gun. If the lead gun determines that there is no probability of an
      inadvertent firing, the following procedures will be used:
         18.7.2.2.1. The aircraft commander may elect to continue the live fire. Dry fires and
         aerial refueling are not authorized. EXCEPTION: Off station aircraft may conduct
         aerial refueling if mission requirements dictate.
         18.7.2.2.2. The aircrew may execute a normal recovery to a full stop at recovery
         airfield. Multiple approaches/pilot pro are not authorized until the malfunction has
         been cleared.
         18.7.2.2.3. Off-station/out and back aircraft are authorized to return to the recovery
         airfield at the completion of their live fire mission. Do not depart an airfield without
         the approval of the squadron commander or operations officer.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   147


          18.7.2.2.4. A 105mm round-case separation is not a hot gun situation. The projectile
          may remain in the barrel with the breach closed. If no attempt was made to fire the
          round, the brass case may be returned to the ammunition rack. Otherwise it will be
          treated as a failure to fire and the case jettisoned. When returning with the projectile
          in the barrel, use the applicable hot gun route to avoid overflight of populated areas.
          No touch and go landings are permitted and the aircraft must be returned to the hot
          cargo area. Request command post notify maintenance and EOD to meet the aircraft.
          18.7.2.2.5. 25mm Inadvertent Firing (AC-130U). If an attempt is made to rotate
          rounds after the 25mm gun has jammed, there is a potential for cracks in the safing
          cam and firing lever to cause inadvertent firing, even with the safing pin installed. If
          a 25mm gun stoppage occurs and it is determined that a gun malfunction (not the
          ASHS or conveyor) caused the stoppage, then hot gun procedures must be performed
          even if the safing pin is installed. If no rounds are in the gun, normal jammed gun
          procedures apply. With the safing pin installed and rounds in the gun, an attempt to
          clear the weapon may be attempted provided the pilot has directed the FCO to go
          fixed on the gun and the pilot can keep the gun pointed at the impact area until the
          weapon is cleared. If the weapon can be cleared, the crew may apply jammed gun
          procedures. If the gun cannot be cleared, hot gun procedures apply. Contingency
          operations only: Crews are authorized to continue operations only when mission
          requirements dictate, provided the safing pin is installed and the 25mm ASHS has
          been isolated. As soon as practical, attempt to clear the weapon using the procedures
          in this paragraph or recover using hot gun procedures.
   18.7.3. Parking with Munitions. If required to park with munitions on board, comply with
   distances in Table 18.1. These separation distances are the minimum required between
   explosives loaded aircraft and any inhabited building, civilian aircraft or civilian/joint use
   runway. All explosives loaded aircraft should be parked in an approved, properly sited
   aircraft parking location (i.e., hot cargo) if available. Calculations were based on a standard
   combat load.

Table 18.1. Parking Restrictions with Munitions On-board.
 MUNITION TYPE                                      CLASS       SEPARATION DISTANCE

 25MM                                                1.2.2                 162 feet
 M206 Flares                                          1.3        75 feet (wingtip clearance)
   18.7.4. Emergency Procedures with Ammunition. Fire:
      18.7.4.1. Notify aircraft commander/crew.
      18.7.4.2. Notify fire department.
      18.7.4.3. Fight fire and remove munitions, if possible. Note time fire envelops munitions.
      18.7.4.4. All non-essential personnel will withdraw to 2,500 feet. Crewmembers fighting
      the fire will withdraw to 2,500 feet when fire envelops munitions, or after arrival of
 148                                                          AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


       firefighters, whichever occurs first. If the NEW exceeds 500 lbs. with 105 MM HE on
       board, non-essential personnel must withdraw to 4,000 feet.
       18.7.4.5. For fire with only division 1.3 munitions (markers, flares, and 105mm clearing
       rounds) on board, non-essential personnel must withdraw to 600 feet. NOTE: Withdraw
       distance requirements are contained in AFMAN 91-201.
18.8. Marker Flare Launching Procedures. All marks will be launched on command of the
pilot/co-pilot.
   18.8.1. Use the following procedures:
       18.8.1.1. “LM, P/Co-pilot (CP) standby to launch marks”
       18.8.1.2. “In-progress LM” – Ensure jettison location is open and mark is prepared
       according to appropriate launch preparation procedures. Rotate base plate to ARMED at
       this time.
       18.8.1.3. “LM standing by to launch marks” – Reply when ready to jettison mark.
       18.8.1.4. “LM, P/CP launch marks, now” – For MK 25, push in port plugs and jettison
       mark. For MK 6, pull igniter plug and jettison mark. NOTE: P/CP allow approximately
       10 seconds for the LM to arm each MK 25.
       18.8.1.5. “Mark(s) away” - Mark(s) jettisoned. NOTE: MK 25 flares burn for
       approximately 13 minutes, if more flares are needed the CP and LM should pre-
       coordinate for further launches.
       18.8.1.6. These procedures will be followed for other illuminated targets used by the TV
       Operator.
   18.8.2. The TV operator will not track a flare at night. Holding the area around the flare and
   keeping the TV camera(s) constantly moving is acceptable when assisting the IR operator in
   acquisition or storing the flares as targets. The indication of a light or flare causing damage
   to the TV system is a halo effect around the light source itself and/or a comet-like trail (H-
   Model) is produced as the camera(s) are moved around the light or flare.
18.9. Target Area Laser Operations. The AC-130 has capabilities for illuminating the target
area. The following paragraphs contain information discussing operation of the airborne laser
illuminator systems. NOTE: Aircrews will use J-Laser terminology when talking with air and
ground forces (Attachment 7).
   18.9.1. Planning Considerations. When planning joint operations with either ground parties
   and/or other aircraft, a clear understanding of illumination procedures must be made prior to
   mission execution. This can reduce unnecessary radio transmissions and loss of situational
   awareness.
       18.9.1.1. Not used
       18.9.1.2. Consider the use of flash-burn procedures (5-10 seconds of laser illumination
       or IR pointer) for friendly identification and/or target confirmation versus extended
       usage.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   149


   18.9.2. Laser Surface Danger Zones (LSDZ) are the designated region where laser radiation
   levels may exceed the maximum permissible exposure level. LSDZs are a function of
   altitude, slant range-to-target and specific buffer angle.

       time will the 1.06 µm tactical mode be used in dry fire areas.
18.10. Search Methods/Techniques. The three search methods are parallel, random cut, and
spiral search. Navigator direction, sensor direction, and sensor/INS guidance are techniques to
search LOCs. When using these methods, the sensor operator should only advise the pilot of
significant changes in direction of the LOC. Terminology used for these methods is contained in
Attachment 8.
   18.10.1. Parallel. Parallel search is appropriate for LOCs in the open when searching for
   larger targets. It is the fastest but least thorough means of searching an LOC. During
   parallel search the sensor operator should position the sensor to provide guidance to the pilot
   so they can keep the aircraft in a favorable position to fire along the LOC at anytime. Using
   the sensor angle display, aircraft heading, and video presentation the sensor operators should
   keep the LOC in front of the aircraft at approximately 30-40° forward, and 30-40° down,
   unless rolling-in on a point. They should also advise the pilot of any major upcoming
   changes in direction of the LOC. (AC-130H) The primary sensor operator should give
   normal consent when performing reconnaissance and drop consent if the LOC is lost in the
   weather, vegetation, or during defensive maneuvering.
   18.10.2. Random Cut. Random cut is appropriate for searching short sections of LOCs or
   small areas while trying to remain unpredictable. It is the most time consuming search
   method. If random cut is to be used effectively the sensor operators must remain oriented. If
   able, during mission planning the tactical crew should discuss the manner in which the
   navigator will direct the crew throughout the area, and who and how the targets will be
   stored. In some instances the pilot may be able to visually maintain the search pattern which
   would free all sensors for detailed searching.
   18.10.3. Spiral. Spiral search is used to search dense wooded areas, curvy LOCs or an LOC
   that is hard to see with the sensors due to excessive foliage, crossover, or terrain. It is the
   most thorough means of searching an LOC and is appropriate when searching for ambushes
   or smaller targets. Spiral search is usually time-consuming, and caution should be used when
 150                                                          AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


   spending extended periods of time in one area. Spiral search can be performed using two
   primary techniques:
       18.10.3.1. INS Target Storing. This is the preferred technique. It is performed by
       starting at a known hold point with both sensors searching along the LOC approximately
       500-1000 meters (depending on terrain). One of the sensor operators will hold a point.
       That position is stored, and confirmed that it held the new position. The process is
       repeated until the entire area is searched.
       18.10.3.2. Sensor-to-sensor. This technique is performed by starting at a common point
       along the LOC. The primary sensor moves out along the LOC and thoroughly searches
       approximately 500-1000 meters (depending on the terrain), and holds a point. The
       secondary sensor will then conduct an extensive search from the start point out to
       approximately 500-1000 meters beyond the primary sensor’s hold point. The FCO will
       swap primary and secondary sensors and the search will continue along the LOC using
       this leap-frog procedure.
   18.10.4. NAV direction. This technique is performed by the navigator giving the pilot
   headings and maintaining the aircraft in the proper position relative to the LOC. The pilot
   disregards his/her Heads-Up Display (HUD)/Attitude Direction Indicator (ADI) guidance
   and follows the navigator’s directions. An advantage of this technique is it allows all sensors
   to search for targets or threats to the aircraft.
   18.10.5. Sensor direction. This technique is performed by the sensor operator giving the
   pilot headings that maintain the aircraft in the proper position relative to the LOC. It can be
   used during parallel search, repositioning the aircraft between points, or to conduct escort.
   18.10.6. Sensor/INS guidance. This technique is achieved by using the MC system to
   provide guidance information to the HUD/ADI. This technique requires minimum crew
   coordination and maintains the aircraft in the most favorable position to acquire and fire on a
   target. Any LOC visible to a sensor operator or programmed in the INS may be searched
   using these techniques. If the sensor operator needs to concentrate on a specific area during
   the search or the LOC is visually lost for any reason (cannot be immediately reacquired), the
   sensor operator will return aircraft guidance to navigator direction or INS guidance. The
   sensor operator may elect to have the pilot maintain the orbit and disregard guidance while
   manually reacquiring the LOC. (AC-130H) The primary sensor should give normal consent
   when performing reconnaissance and drop consent if the LOC is lost in the weather,
   vegetation, or during defensive maneuvering. NOTE: Sensor guidance and direction are
   both very effective techniques to perform reconnaissance, but the aircraft position along the
   LOC is only important when the likelihood exists that the crew will need to engage targets.
   If not, these techniques can also be used to simply search an area.
18.11. Tactical Considerations.
   18.11.1. Laser Ranging. The primary means to update target elevation is the LTD/RF (AC-
   130H) or the LTD/ERF (AC-130U). The crew will coordinate on procedures to update the
   target elevation during tactical planning. The TV operator will lase when directed by the
   FCO and cleared by the pilot, notifying the crew of the laser’s status over MAIN interphone.
   No clearance or crew notification is required for the use of the ELRF (AC-130H)or the ERF
   (AC-130U) for target elevation updates. This should be continually accomplished if there is
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                       151


   a significant change of terrain or if the aircraft moves to a different target location. This is an
   area of major concern in mountainous terrain, due to varying slant ranges and target
   elevations. (AC-130U) APQ-180, Air Ground Ranging mode overrides the LTD/ERF during
   ranging operations.
   18.11.2. Cargo Door. Due to structural stress and airspeed limitations encountered during
   some aircraft defensive maneuvers, the cargo door will be kept closed in high threat
   environments. In certain non-maneuvering flight situations (i.e., search and rescue missions)
   consideration may be given to flying with the cargo door open.
18.12. Defensive Tactics.
   18.12.1. Specific defensive procedures are contained in AFTTP 3-1.AC-130.
   18.12.2. Practice Defensive Maneuvers. All crewmembers will be advised of the time
   period when they may expect threat maneuvers. This simulated threat time will provide
   maximum safety to prevent personnel injury during the rapid changes of aircraft position.
   Crewmembers should be prepared for abrupt maneuvers during any phase of flight and
   should remain strapped in whenever flight duties do not require them to move about the
   aircraft. During training, defensive maneuvers should not feature sustained zero G profiles.
18.13. Collateral Missions.
   18.13.1. Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance. Refer to AFTTP 3-1 Volume 1, General
   Planning Considerations and AFTTP 3-1.AC-130, Tactical Employment, AC-130. When
   working with ground parties, gunship crews will not give weapons release authority unless
   authority is delegated to the gunship.
   18.13.2. Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR). The AC-130 should act as On-Scene
   Commander (OSC) until relieved. Reference OSC checklist (Attachment 10).
18.14. AAR General. NATO publication ATP 56(B) Parts 1 and 2 provide the basic guidance
for refueling terminology and procedures. Crews will refer to the aircraft technical order for
expanded receiver guidance and procedures.
   18.14.1. DELETED
18.15. Policy. The following policies apply to all air to air refueling conditions regardless of
emission control or type of rendezvous:
   18.15.1. Minimum crew requirement. AAR qualified pilot, co-pilot certified in AAR pre-
   contact, navigator certified in AAR and a flight engineer certified in AAR (or in training
   under the supervision of an instructor).
   18.15.2. Use manual boom latching procedures only during fuel emergencies and
   contingency operations. EXCEPTION: Manual boom latching procedures are authorized
   for all AAR operations with the KC-10A if the tanker’s independent disconnect system is
   operational. WARNING: During AAR operations, do not make any HF radio transmissions
   or ECM emissions. Infrared Counter Measures (IRCM) pods may be left in OPERATE
   mode.
18.16. Formation Procedures General. Formation is defined as aircraft maneuvering with
respect to a common leader exercising mutual support for a common objective. For specific
tactical formation employment reference AFTTP 3-1.31. This section prescribes basic formation
 152                                                          AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


procedures. They are a guideline, primarily designed to be used in VMC. IMC procedures are
employed in extraordinary circumstances when IMC is encountered inadvertently or when the
mission demands IMC penetration.
   18.16.1. Limit formations to three aircraft.
       18.16.1.1. Dissimilar Formations. Deployment operations may require different MDS
       AFSOC aircraft to fly together in formation. The AFSOC standard is the 2,000 foot
       visual trail. The minimum lateral spacing for different MDS aircraft will be 500 feet. If
       flight in visual conditions is not possible, use pre-briefed IMC procedures to provide
       separation between aircraft. The lead aircraft will direct wingmen to assume IMC
       spacing well prior to the formation entering the weather. For formation AAR use
       geometries and positioning described in ATP 56(B). WARNING: When flying alternate
       formations it may be necessary to modify inadvertent weather penetration procedures.
   18.16.2. Command and Control. Clear lines of command must be established during
   formation flight. This does not prevent other formation members from suggesting a course
   of action. Personnel in the following roles will be identified during mission planning and
   will be annotated on the flight orders (unless noted otherwise):
       18.16.2.1. Airborne Mission Commander (AMC). The individual responsible for the
       overall safe and effective employment of air assets. Required where mission complexity
       dictates. The AMC should not be a primary crewmember. When communicating to the
       rest of the formation as the airborne mission commander, use that call sign.
       18.16.2.2. Formation Commander. Required on every formation mission. The
       designated commander of a formation of aircraft and responsible for successful
       completion of the formation's portion of the mission. Usually chosen from the Aircraft
       Commanders involved in the mission (usually the lead pilot). The pilot of the lead
       aircraft (if not the airborne mission commander) is empowered to conduct the mission as
       planned including any planned alternates and immediate actions necessary for formation
       safety. The airborne mission commander has the responsibility to direct all other changes
       to the mission. The formation commander works closely with the AMC (if one is
       utilized) to accomplish the overall mission. The formation commander is usually
       designated DMC in missions employing a dedicated AMC.
       18.16.2.3. Deputy Mission Commander. Required on all missions employing a
       dedicated AMC, on all multi-element formation missions, and on all single-element
       formations of three aircraft or more. The DMC assumes command if conditions prevent
       the AMC from controlling the mission. The DMC may be a primary crewmember, and is
       usually the Formation Commander on AMC controlled missions.
       18.16.2.4. Formation Lead. The lead aircraft in a formation flight. Responsible for
       proper mission execution and other immediate action events during a formation flight.
   18.16.3. Specified Times. The mission commander determines the sequence of events and
   mission times based on staff input, fuel requirements, user needs, taxi distances, briefing
   requirements, etc.
   18.16.4. Pre-takeoff Procedures:
       18.16.4.1. Taxi (formation taxi is optional). Minimum taxi interval is one aircraft length.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   153


      18.16.4.2. Runway Positioning. Aircraft alternate sides with nose to tail clearance. If
      feed-on method is used, subsequent aircraft move into takeoff position as preceding
      aircraft start takeoff roll. This method is used when runway length or gross weight
      demands the entire runway be used or maximum power be applied prior to brake release.
   18.16.5. Takeoff:
      18.16.5.1. Interval. Minimum takeoff interval between aircraft in VMC is 15 seconds.
          18.16.5.1.1. If the weather does not allow a VMC departure the formation will depart
          single ship, minimum one minute separation, and rejoin after VMC conditions are
          attained. If VMC cannot be attained fly radar/TACAN in-trail.
      18.16.5.2. Application of Power. To prevent damage to succeeding aircraft, do not
      advance power above flight idle until takeoff roll is started. Use a smooth application of
      power to achieve takeoff torque. If full power is required prior to brake release ensure
      adequate separation or use feed-on method. Lead will pre-brief takeoff power settings.
      18.16.5.3. Abort During Takeoff. If an aircraft aborts during takeoff roll, the navigator
      will immediately transmit on inter-plane frequency and the copilot on primary ATC
      frequency (after completing emergency procedures requiring immediate action) the
      formation position and the word “Aborting” three times. For example, “Number 1
      aborting, Number 1 aborting, Number 1 aborting.” The aborting aircraft will clear the
      runway as expeditiously and as safely possible. Succeeding aircraft will hold until the
      runway is clear. If takeoff run has already been started by succeeding aircraft, they will
      abort and clear the runway.
   18.16.6. En Route. In the ATC environment, all aircraft not in a standard formation
   (standard formation is defined as less than 1 mile horizontal separation and less than 100 feet
   vertical, IAW FAA) will be fully lighted as required by AFI 11-202V3.
      18.16.6.1. At night, lead will announce unplanned airspeed changes of greater than 15
      knots, unless briefed otherwise.
      18.16.6.2. Aircraft aborting after assembly will notify lead and turn away from the
      formation and rejoin at the end or proceed to a suitable recovery field. Aircraft within
      flight will reposition as briefed.
18.17. Formation AAR.
   18.17.1. Weather Minimums. Rendezvous closure will not be continued inside 1 SM unless
   visual contact is established with the tanker. AAR will not be continued when in-flight
   visibility is deemed insufficient for AAR operations. Lead is responsible for weather
   avoidance during the rendezvous until.1/2 NM from contact. Any aircraft in the formation
   may advise the formation of inclement weather on the refueling track.
   18.17.2. Lead will direct the formation to either a right echelon or in-trail (IMC), stacked up
   500 feet, prior to the entry point or air refueling initial point. Lead will call out the base
   altitude and occupy that altitude while maintaining 1000 feet separation between the highest
   receiver and lowest tanker.
      18.17.2.1. If visibility is 2 NM or greater. Wingmen maintain a loose visual, 300 feet
      nose-to-tail clearance and 150 feet lateral wingtip clearance until lead calls AAR
 154                                                            AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


       complete. Lead will make this call on air refueling frequency when established in a loose
       visual position on the tanker’s left wing. After lead calls AAR complete, number two is
       cleared to pre-contact. Number two calls AAR complete on air refueling frequency when
       established on lead’s left wing. After number two AAR complete, number three is
       cleared to pre-contact. Number three will call AAR complete when established on lead’s
       left side. WARNING: Do not cross behind an aircraft in pre-contact/contact.
18.18. Interphone System. The highly complex systems and the large number of crewmembers
may cause confusion and loss of mission effectiveness if coordination and discipline are not
stressed at all times. Communications on MAIN interphone/HOT XMT will be limited to
mission related items during checklists, taxi, munitions upload/ download, weapons delivery,
AAR, takeoff, approach and landing.
   18.18.1. All crewmembers will monitor MAIN interphone (AC-130H - and HOT RCV).
   Conduct all challenge and response checklists on MAIN interphone or HOT XMT. MAIN
   intercom will serve as the primary means of communication between crewmembers except as
   noted below:
       18.18.1.1. During AAR, AC-130U pilots will select HOT MIC on P1, and AC-130H
       pilots will select HOT XMT.
       18.18.1.2. Pilots and Lead Gun will monitor P2 during tactical operations.
       18.18.1.3. The NAV, FCO, EWO, and TV/IR will use P2 for normal communications.
       18.18.1.4. The FE, LM, and Aerial Gunner (AG) will use P1 for normal communication
       between their stations. The lead gun will advise the flight engineer of gun status over P1.
       During 105 MM operations the “Gun Ready” call will be made by the FE to the crew
       over MAIN interphone.
       18.18.1.5. Use the CALL system, if able, to alert the crew to threats and aircraft
       emergencies requiring immediate attention.
       18.18.1.6. All crew positions will use their respective ISO nets and LOCAL when
       available for additional crew coordination or training.
       18.18.1.7. . A minimum of one gunner will remain on interphone during two engine
       shutdown for ordnance loading/downloading procedures.
18.19. Air-to-Surface and Air-to-Air Training. AFI 11-214 describes minimum weather
requirements for training.
   18.19.1. Aircraft bank will be limited to 60 º and pitch is limited to +/- 15 º.
   18.19.2. Air-to-surface minimum weather will be sufficient to allow the crew to visually
   observe the round to impact. EXCEPTION: AC-130U using procedures found in 18.19.5.
       18.19.2.1. The AC-130H will not shoot in IMC with ground personnel in peacetime.
   18.19.3. AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, is the parent instruction for all AF
   ranges. Wings/Groups will publish range procedures for frequently used weapons ranges
   IAW AFI 13-212V1 and Chapter 10 to this instruction.
       18.19.3.1. Not used.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   155


      18.19.3.2. If not using an AF range gunship crews will use the component/Host Nation
      range procedures.
   18.19.4. VMC Range Clearing.
      18.19.4.1. Visually clear the target area and weapon safety footprint areas on AF Class B
      and Class C ranges before live firing.
      18.19.4.2. Visually clear the target area and weapon safety footprint areas at non-AF
      ranges.
   18.19.5. AC-130U Range Operations in IMC.
      18.19.5.1. On an AF range the crew will use a Class A only; however, the range does not
      need to be a scoreable range. Range control clearance to fire is assurance the target area
      and weapon(s) safety footprint is clear. At a non-AF range the crew will be under the
      control of a Range Control Officer (RCO) on the ground for the range in use. Procedures
      will be established to insure safety prior to using the range and approved by the RCO.
      For frequently used ranges publish these procedures in Chapter 10. As a minimum:
          18.19.5.1.1. Perform Sensor/Sensor calibrations as required, and perform slaving
          checks of the radar to the primary INS.
          18.19.5.1.2. Monitor GUARD and maintain two-way radio contact with the RCO.
          The Army also requires two separate radios and frequencies. A cellular phone is not
          acceptable.
          18.19.5.1.3. The only sensor authorized is the APQ-180 radar in Trainable (TRN),
          Fixed (FXD), or Semi Automatic (SEMI) in Direct (DIR) or Offset (OFS) target
          mode with the 105 MM, 40 MM and use PIPP to tweak and periodically check the
          accuracy. When shooting in OFS target mode a ground party RCO will observe and
          adjust fire.
          18.19.5.1.4. The 25MM may be fired, if required for training, if the gun was tweaked
          prior to IMC and the copy tweak was live fire checked to the radar.
18.20. Tweak and Live Fire Operations.
   18.20.1. A sensor alignment checklist will be completed prior to any live fire training.
   18.20.2. Peacetime. A tweak will be completed prior to live fire training with ground
   personnel.
      18.20.2.1. If there has been a gun boresight, sensor harmonization, gun replacement, or
      IR removal/replacement then Medium Field Of View (MFOV) will be used until shots
      begin to fall within Narrow Field of View (NFOV) parameters. Do not attempt to
      perform combat tweak or sensor offset shooting with autotrack engaged.
      18.20.2.2. (AC-130U) The Q39 (MTV) will not fire the 25mm at night with less than
      50% IR selected as the primary mode.
      18.20.2.3. (AC130U) When shooting in Semi-Auto (SEMI), Manual (MAN), or
      Override (ORIDE) during training, the pilot will cease fire and have the FE safe the
      gun(s) when aircraft bank angle is less than 10º or greater than 45º.
156                                                           AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


         18.20.2.3.1. (AC-130U) The only gun position inhibit in ORIDE is the firing
         envelope. It is possible that a gun could move out of position during firing if a
         malfunction occurs.
         18.20.2.3.2. (AC-130U) In ORIDE, the MC gun positioning checks are bypassed.
         The gun position must be checked with the LWCP and/or manual readout assemblies.
         Failure to do so may result in damage to the airplane or injury to personnel.
         18.20.2.3.3. (AC-130U) Aircrews need to be aware of the potential hazard and pay
         close attention during live fire operations in ORIDE. The Pilot will have accurate
         Primary Aimline (PA) and computed impact point aiming cues in SEMI/ORIDE and
         FXD/ORIDE. The FCO should check commanded/actual gun angles prior to each
         shot.
         18.20.2.3.4. (AC-130U) MAN/ORIDE mode will not be used during live-fire
         training with ground parties. Fire no closer to ground parties than 1,000 meters
         during live-fire training in SEMI/ORIDE and FXD/ORIDE.
      18.20.2.3.5. (AC-130U) The TV Operator will not engage Ground Point Track while
      attempting to fire with the All Light Level Television (ALLTV).

      18.20.2.8. A minimum of 1,000 feet altitude separation from the highest known
      trajectory or danger area will be used for combined live fire operations with ground
      artillery, mortar, or helicopter fire. Helicopters firing 30 mm, .50 cal, or 2.75‖ rockets
      have a 5,000 feet AGL danger area. Helicopters using 7.62 mm only have a 3,000 feet
      AGL danger area.
  18.20.3. Danger Close. JP 3-09.3 defines danger close as the 0.1% probability of
  incapacitation based on Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manual (JMEM) data. For targets
  inside the 0.1% probability of incapacitation, the ground commander or authorized controller
  (fire support officer, team leader, etc.), must accept responsibility for risk to friendly forces
  IAW JP 3-09.3 by passing his initials and stating, ―”CLEARED DANGER CLOSE”. If the
  mission is preplanned, the ground commander or designated representative should pre-brief
  acceptable minimum engagement distances. AFTTP(I) 3-2.6 (JFIRE) is the source document
  for all danger close distances.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                  157


       18.20.3.1. Peacetime Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to all peacetime
       training missions. These do not apply anytime the ground forces commander requests
       fire support under CJCSI 3121.10 or any other Standing Rules of Engagement for US
       Forces.
       18.20.3.2. Crews will select a tweak target a minimum of 750 meters away from all
       ground parties to compensate for untweaked system accuracy and fragmentation effects.
       Once the tweak is complete and the fire control system has been verified accurate
       (impacts are within 5 mils of aimpoint), crews will fire no closer to ground parties with
       the visual sensors than 600 meters with 105 MM HE, white phosphorous (WP) and high
       fragmentation (HF), 400 meters for all 25 MM and 105 MM Target Practice (TP), and
       300 meters for all 40 MM. AC-130U live fire with the APQ-180 strike radar, and AC-
       130H with the APQ-150 beacon tracking radar, will fire no closer to ground parties than
       650 meters with the 105 MM and 500 meters with the 25MM/40MM.
       18.20.3.3. Use no-fire zones if the ground party is within 700 meters for the 105 MM
       PGU-43/B (TP) round and 2000 meters for the 25 MM PGU-23/B (TP) round. This
       restriction includes 25 MM TP/high explosive incendiary mix. To determine the no-fire
       headings, compute the bearing from friendly position to target, subtract 60º for beginning
       of no-fire zone and subtract another 60º for end of no-fire zone. AC-130U MC no-fire
       radials are plus and minus 30º from the friendly position to target bearing.
   18.20.4. Combat and Contingency. If unable to perform a tweak prior to reaching the target
   area, the first round should be placed as far as practical from friendly positions. Subsequent
   rounds can then be brought onto the target. This will reduce the hazard to friendly ground
   forces when firing untweaked weapons.
   18.20.5. Coordinate whether or not the FCO will continue to update the tweak or allow the
   sensor operators to continually use sensor offset without updating the tweak.
       18.20.5.1. Once the offset/correction has been identified the sensor operator will not aim
       direct unless directed by the FCO, or when trying to redefine the correction.
   18.20.6. WARNING: Any crewmember detecting an unsafe condition during live fire will
   call "CEASE FIRE." Firing will not resume until the unsafe condition is corrected.
   18.20.7. WARNING: During peacetime, do not point a loaded and armed weapon at a
   friendly position. Failure to heed this warning could cause injury or death to friendly ground
   forces if inadvertent gun firing should occur.
   18.20.8. WARNING: Do not load or fire the 105 MM in moderate or greater turbulence.
18.21. Prestrike. The prestrike phase begins prior to the combat entry point and includes
activities prior to target acquisition. In most cases these duties apply from before combat entry
until past the combat exit point.

   18.23.2. Navigator Duties:
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   161


       18.23.2.1. Assume primary navigation duties.
       18.23.2.2. Relay appropriate command and control information to inbound aircraft and

   18.23.3. Sensor Operator Duties:
       18.23.3.1. Collect all BDA material and classified material as required, and prepare for
       the intelligence debrief upon landing.
18.24. Intelligence Gathering. Every crewmember that flies a tactical mission will debrief the
intelligence section immediately after the mission.
18.25. Tactical Recoveries. Options are to enter the traffic pattern via an initial, downwind,
base, straight-in, or perpendicular to the runway. During hostile activity, the pilot can control
several factors that may reduce the time in a threat envelope. These are altitude, arrival and
departure flight path, proximity to the airfield, and proximity to known threats. The approach
must be unpredictable. Comprehensive mission planning and knowledge of the threat location,
density, and capability will dictate the specific tactics to be employed. The recommendations
below are some examples; however, ingenuity is the key in determining what type of approach to
fly. NOTE: All tactical approaches will be to a normal landing.
   18.25.1. Random steep approach. This maneuver is based on a modified 360 degree
   overhead approach to a normal landing. Conditions may require that the example random
   steep approach described below be modified to satisfy local conditions (Figure 18.4.).
       18.25.1.1. Establish initial at approximately 4,500 feet AGL and accomplish the before
       landing checklist.
       18.25.1.2. When approximately one-third of the distance down the runway, extend 100
       percent flaps and commence descent while beginning a 360 degree turn to final.
       18.25.1.3. Maintain 140 knots indicated airspeed or approach speed, whichever is higher,
       until wings level on final. Plan the approach to remain within two miles of the airfield
       and to enter no less than a ¼ mile and not more than a one mile final. The maneuver can
       be modified to enter on other than an initial; i.e., 270 or 90 degree overhead. In these
       cases change the initial altitude according to the pilot’s judgment.
   18.25.2. Random shallow approach. These maneuvers are based on approaching the airfield
   from various directions at low en route altitude (e.g., 300 feet AGL) and en route airspeed
   with the descent/before landing checklist accomplished. The random shallow straight in and
   random shallow abeam are two examples of random shallow approaches (Figure 18.5. and
   Figure 18.6.).
       18.25.2.1. Begin a level slowdown maneuvering to approach speed at a predetermined
       point. While remaining at low altitude, maneuver the aircraft to enter a point on final no
       less than ¼ mile from the runway, accomplish the before landing checklist, and complete
       the landing IAW the flight manual.
       18.25.2.2. The pilot may elect to make a climbing slowdown to normal traffic pattern
       altitude. Maneuver the aircraft to enter no less than a ¼ mile final, accomplish the before
       landing checklist, and complete the landing IAW the flight manual.

18.26. Self Contained Approaches (SCA). SCA procedures may be used for approaches to
conventional airfields. Comply with local ATC restrictions and host nation agreements, as
appropriate.
   18.26.1. AC-130H SCAs are flown to a Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA) and Missed
   Approach Point (MAP). AC-130U Automatic Instrument Landing Approaches (AILAs) are
   SCAs flown to a decision altitude (DA).
   18.26.2. Weather minimums. All SCAs must be conducted in VMC unless HQ AFSOC/A3
   approves IMC operations. Comply with the AFSOC supplement to AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
   If approved, IMC SCA minimums will be no lower 300 feet and 1 SM.
      18.26.2.1. DELETED
   18.26.3. MDA/DA. To compute MDA/DA for VMC or approved IMC operations, add 300
   feet to the Touchdown Zone Elevation (TDZE).
   18.26.4. Missed Approach. The MAP (AC-130H) will be at 1 NM distance to go on the
   mission computer at MDA. AC-130U missed approach will be executed at DA if landing
   criteria are not met.
   18.26.5. SCA Construction. Use the most current sources for topological, point obstruction,
   and airfield information. Consider using radar reflectors, radar beacons, or existing airfield
   NAVAIDS to increase the reliability of the approach.
      18.26.5.1. Obstacle Clearance. The location of terrain and obstructions will dictate the
      glide slope and altitude profile used. Along the planned ground track, maintain a
      minimum of 300 feet above the highest obstacle within 1 NM between the MIA and the
164                                                           AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


      MDA/DA. Cross-check the SCA template against terminal area charts, radar, and
      available NAVAIDS. Use the following procedures to analyze obstacles:
         18.26.5.1.1. Draw the horizontal obstacle clearance template, depicted in Figure
         18.8, on a 1:250,000 or larger scale chart, if available. The template begins 0.3 NM
         either side of LZ centerline at the touchdown point, extending outward to 1 NM either
         side of centerline at 3 NM from the touchdown point. The template will encompass
         all terrain 1 NM either side of centerline from the planned descent point extending to
         1 NM beyond the planned descent point (For example, a 3.2 NM planned descent
         point requires a 4.2 NM long template). If the planned descent point is less than 2
         NM from the touchdown zone, then the standard 3 NM template will not require
         extension. Refer to Figure 18.7 SCA Horizontal Obstruction Template. NOTE:
         These are minimum distances and may be increased. Consider such factors as the
         availability of radar or IR targets and recent NAVAID performance.
      18.26.5.2. Significant and critical obstacles. Using current large-scale charts, airfield
      diagrams, airfield sketches, approach plates, and imagery, locate significant obstacles
      within the boundary of the horizontal template. Significant obstacles are those within
      300 feet of the desired glide slope. Determine the HAT for each obstacle by subtracting
      TDZE from the MSL elevation of the obstacle. For each obstacle, plot the along-course
      distance from touchdown and HAT on the critical obstacle graph as shown in Figure
      18.9 Critical Obstacle Chart. An obstacle is considered critical if it falls above the
      reference line for the planned glide slope or its extension along the depicted baseline.
         18.26.5.2.1. For each critical obstacle identified, preplan and brief a specific means
         of avoidance to be used during the approach. The following examples may be used
         separately or in combination:
             18.26.5.2.1.1. Use a steeper glide slope. Glide slopes exceeding 4.0º should be
             carefully considered due to the high rate of descent required.
             18.26.5.2.1.2. Move the touchdown point further down the runway.
             18.26.5.2.1.3. Increase MDA/DA.
             18.26.5.2.1.4. Establish an intermediate step-down altitude above the MDA at
             which the aircraft will level off until positive separation from the obstacle is
             assured.
             18.26.5.2.1.5. Change the approach to the opposite end of the runway, crossing
             runway, parallel runway, etc.
         18.26.5.2.2. Draw the relative position of each critical obstacle on the template and
         annotate its distance-to-go, distance abeam final course centerline, and height (AGL
         and MSL).
      18.26.5.3. Missed Approach and Departure. For planning, allow a minimum of 0.3 NM
      along track error and 0.3 NM cross track error at the MAP. Assume IMC when choosing
      the missed approach/departure flight path. Construct a horizontal obstacle clearance
      template beginning at the MAP and incorporating the planned missed approach/departure
      flight path. Use TDZE as the MSL start point for the missed approach. If the terrain
      along this flight path (including the above errors) rises at a rate greater than 200 feet/NM,
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   165


      refer to the performance manual to verify that three-engine climb out will clear terrain.
      Use the three-engine climb angle in place of glide slope (refer to formula below).

Table 18.2. Example Horizontal Obstacle Clearance Formula.


                Angle of Climb = Rate of Climb (ft/min) x 0.5652 GS (knots)


          18.26.5.3.1. The horizontal obstacle clearance template for climb out extends from
          the approach end of the runway out to 1.0 NM past level off at the initial escape en
          route altitude. The lateral limits of the climb out template are the same as for the
          straight-in approach.
             18.26.5.3.1.1. If any critical obstacles are identified, consider using turns during
             climb out to avoid them. Ensure that the three-engine climb path provides
             sufficient clearance from obstacles and terrain along the flight path.
      18.26.5.4. SCA Vertical Template Construction. Starting at the touchdown zone,
      construct a glide slope using the desired gradient (feet/NM) to a point along the final
      approach course (or transition path, if applicable) where it intercepts the planned
      approach altitude (refer to Figure 18.10). Annotate the glide slope MSL and AGL
      altitudes for each 1 NM distance-to-go increment out to the planned descent point.
   18.26.6. In-flight Crew Coordination Measures. All available sensors will be used to locate
   the runway and notify the aircraft commander upon acquisition. Evaluate the navigation
   solution to ensure the most reliable navigation data is being integrated. The navigator and
   the pilot not flying the approach will monitor the CARA and barometric altimeters to verify
   terrain clearance. To better monitor and direct the SCA, the navigator may deviate from the
   'Before Landing' Checklist and wait to re-position the seat for landing until the pilot
   executing the approach calls the landing field in sight.
      18.26.6.1. AC-130H:
          18.26.6.1.1. The navigator will brief the approach during the Before Landing
          Checklist to include: inbound course, descent point, glide slope, MDA, MAP,
          significant obstacles, and missed approach instructions. All available navigation
          equipment will be used to provide centerline guidance. The navigator will provide
          the pilot with centerline advisory calls and altitude guidance during the approach
          down to the MAP or until field is called in-sight.
      18.26.6.2. AC-130U:
          18.26.6.2.1. The navigator will brief the approach during the Before Landing
          Checklist to include: inbound course, descent point, glide slope, DA, significant
          obstacles, and missed approach instructions. Advise the pilot any time GPS is not in
          the navigation solution. The navigator will provide the pilot with centerline advisory
          calls and altitude guidance during the approach down to the DA or until field is called
          in-sight. Inform the pilot when the course is active, when the glideslope is active, and
          when cleared to begin descent to DA.

      18.26.6.2.2. Select ADC for the altitude source and enter the current altimeter setting
      received from the tower. If GPS is not integrated, or if the navigation solution is
      otherwise inaccurate, update the aircraft position and recalculate/store the AILA
      using a sensor sight point, radar mark centered on the near runway point, or enter best
      available coordinates immediately prior to executing AILA guidance.
      18.26.6.2.3. The navigator should monitor the approach using RBGM or WHX
      modes of the radar as well as the TSM and horizontal situation indicator on the BMC
      multifunction display. Level off and execute missed approach procedures if the glide
      slope commands a descent below the intermediate altitudes. Pay particular attention
      to the impact of wind and ground speeds on obstruction clearance capability in the
      event of missed approach/go around.

18.27. NVG Takeoff and Landing Procedures. NOTE: Low Altitude environment is defined
as 1,000’ above the highest obstacle within 3 NM.
   18.27.1. General: NVG takeoff and landing procedures are designed for departures and
   recoveries from overseas airbases or Forward Operating Locations with marginally secure
   airfield perimeters. NVG use during taxi, takeoff, approach, and landing is situational
   dependent, but may be necessary to reduce risk to the aircraft and/or airfield. NVG takeoffs
   can be made into low altitude operations, but will normally be made following IFR or tactical
   departure procedures. Recoveries can also be performed from the low altitude environment,
   but will most likely be a transition from high altitude to place the aircraft on final approach,
   properly configured, in a position to identify the Landing Zone and complete the landing.
   NVG approaches are standard instrument or SCA procedures modified to be flown on NVGs.
   Covert Recoveries (CR)are standard Random Steep, Random Shallow, Overhead, and
   Downwind procedures modified to be flown on NVGs. In all cases, normal checklists will
   be used.
      18.27.1.1. Crew Qualification Requirements for NVG Takeoff and Landing Operations:
      Pilots, copilots, and flight engineers require NVG airland certification.
      18.27.1.2. Runway marking will be IAW AFI 13-217.
170                                                            AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


      18.27.1.3. The PIC will preflight and carry one spare NVG set and batteries.
      18.27.1.4. Check for bleed through on the infrared lights prior to takeoff. Use the
      minimum lighting required, even when using covert lights.
      18.27.1.5. NVG landings require one pilot’s radar altimeter to be operational. The
      navigator’s radar altimeter will be operational for training flights. Blacked-out landings
      require either the IDS to be operational, or INS and GPS in the navigation system
      solution.
      18.27.1.6. Ensure both interior and exterior lights are correctly set and are as dim as
      possible commensurate with safety and visibility.
      18.27.1.7. All crewmembers, especially the pilots, must be extremely vigilant in the use
      of instruments to back up visual maneuvers performed while using NVGs. The resulting
      loss of visual acuity and depth perception could result in a dangerous flight condition if
      aircraft attitude, bank angle, AGL altitude, descent rate, etc., are not confirmed with the
      aircraft instruments. All visual maneuvering will be backed up with the navigation
      system and all available sensors.
  18.27.2. General Planning Considerations:
      18.27.2.1. Threat Analysis. The possible threat is the most important factor in
      determining the type of departure and recovery, including the route of flight to and from
      the LZ. For CRs, the type and direction of recovery should be varied (threat and airspace
      permitting) to avoid a predictable recovery pattern from day to day.
      18.27.2.2. Confirm the local altimeter setting that will be used for the landing.
      18.27.2.3. Approach Path and Glide Slope Construction. See Section 18H of this
      instruction. Plan to intercept a 3 degree glide slope unless terrain or obstructions dictate a
      different glideslope. Avoid using glide slopes greater than 5 degrees, due to high descent
      rates. Slowdown to approach speed normally occurs approximately 3 NM prior to glide
      slope interception. For Covert recoveries, slowdown as briefed for the particular
      procedure.
         18.27.2.3.1. The NAV will construct an approach plate for the SCA using the AF
         Form 4118 (SCA Planning Form), or an OG/OGV approved planning form.
      18.27.2.4. Chart Preparation. Use the largest scale chart available from 10 NM inbound.
      A 1:50,000 chart is preferred, but in no case will it be smaller than 1:250,000. The
      navigator should select update points for the navigation system and altimeter. Chart
      construction will include the following additional items: the Initial Point (IP) or Initial
      Approach Fix (IAF), slowdown points, descent point, and the missed approach,
      departure, and go-around paths. Ensure update points for the navigation system and
      altimeter are annotated. It is of utmost importance to have sufficient, reliable position
      and altitude update points prior to the IP (or IAF) and final run-in.
      18.27.2.5. NVG Airland Briefing. During the tactical mission briefing, coordinate crew
      duties and discuss all aspects of the NVG portion of the mission to include aircraft and
      airfield lighting configuration, specific crew communications during normal and
      emergency procedures, transfer of aircraft control, and maneuvers to be flown.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                  171


  18.27.3. Taxi Operations. When taxiing on NVGs, extreme caution must be exercised since
  obstacles are hard to see and depth perception is reduced. Other aircraft, vehicles, and
  personnel may be operating blacked out. A thorough study of the airfield environment
  during mission planning is essential. Use the following procedures to ensure obstacle
  clearance and safe taxi operations:
     18.27.3.1. Use as many NVG equipped scanners as practical.
     18.27.3.2. Reduce and monitor taxi speed closely.
     18.27.3.3. Accomplish checklists with the aircraft stopped while in congested areas.
     18.27.3.4. When possible, use all available sensors to assist taxi operations.
     18.27.3.5. When in doubt, use external observers (deplane crew members if necessary) to
     ensure obstacle clearance during taxi.
  18.27.4. Takeoff Procedures. Pilots should maintain a good instrument cross check
  throughout the takeoff and departure. Be prepared to transition to instruments similar to an
  IMC takeoff. After takeoff, continue to clear for terrain and obstacles using NVGs.
     18.27.4.1. At rotation speed, the pilot rotates the aircraft to establish a positive nose-up
     attitude. The copilot will raise the flaps on command of the pilot. As an additional safety
     measure, the Flight Engineer will have NVGs immediately ready during takeoff and
     climb-out to help clear for terrain and obstacles.
     18.27.4.2. During the departure, the navigator will provide direction as necessary to keep
     the aircraft on course. Use all available sensors to clear for terrain and obstacles on the
     departure route.
  18.27.5. IFR or SCA Approach Procedures. Fly standard procedures to place the aircraft on
  final approach.
  18.27.6. Covert Recovery (CR) Procedures. The CR approach and landing is a visual
  maneuver backed up with the navigation system and all available sensors. CRs, Random
  Steep, Random Shallow, Overhead, and Downwind procedures in Section 18G are modified
  as follows:
     18.27.6.1. A slowdown point will be planned and briefed for Random Steep and Random
     Shallow approaches. Pilots will call their own slowdowns for Overhead and Downwind
     approaches.
     18.27.6.2. A full SCA Plate for landing runway is required.
     18.27.6.3. Final approach course will be programmed into the navigation system.
     18.27.6.4. The NAV will make standard SCA altitude calls and glideslope advisories as
     described in 18.27.7.3.
     18.27.6.5. On a CR, if both pilots do not have the landing zone environment in sight by
     wings level on final, execute a go-around.
  18.27.7. Approach Execution:
     18.27.7.1. General. Each pilot should ensure both NVG batteries are operational during
     the Descent Checklist. Accomplish a thorough approach briefing prior to commencing
172                                                          AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


      approach to include comprehensive missed approach/go-around procedures. Coordinate
      use of the IR and TV sensors to aid in locating the LZ, clearing for hazardous terrain and
      obstacles, and confirming the runway is clear of obstructions.
      18.27.7.2. Low Altitude Operations: A SCA or random shallow should usually be the
      planned recovery from the low altitude environment. Maintain enroute profile until
      descent for landing. The copilot’s and navigator’s radar altimeters should remain set at
      enroute altitude setting until the slowdown. At slowdown, the radar altimeters may be
      reset as briefed.
      18.27.7.3. Navigator Coordination:
         18.27.7.3.1. The navigator will make distance calls at every mile inside ten miles and
         every half mile inside three miles (or as briefed), unless distance to the LZ is
         displayed on the pilot’s instruments.
         18.27.7.3.2. When glidepath guidance is provided to the pilot’s flight director
         system, the navigator will call “Cleared to intercept glideslope.” If not, follow
         procedures in 18.27.7.3.3.
         18.27.7.3.3. At glideslope interception on an SCA, the navigator will state "Begin
         Descent," and repeat the desired initial descent rate. The navigator will provide
         glidepath advisories on SCAs and CRs with reference to the navigation system, the
         navigator’s pressure altimeter, and the radar altimeter. These calls will be made at
         1/2 NM intervals until reaching the "100 feet" call. State deviations in excess of 150
         feet explicitly. The navigator also advises the pilot if the aircraft is correcting to or
         diverging from glidepath, using the term "Rapidly," if appropriate. As a guide, the
         following criteria may be used for glideslope deviation calls:
             18.27.7.3.3.1. Slightly above or below: 50 feet.
             18.27.7.3.3.2. Above or below: 100 feet.
             18.27.7.3.3.3. Well above or below: 150 feet.
         18.27.7.3.4. The navigator will call 100, 50, 25 and 10 feet above touchdown.
         18.27.7.3.5. When executing a go-around or departure, the navigator will call out
         passing 100, 200, and 300 feet AGL.
      18.27.7.4. Before Landing Checklist. Initiate the Before Landing Checklist at the point
      identified during mission planning. Slow to approach speed at this planned point.
      Depending on the type of landing, the flight engineer or copilot will extend the IR and/or
      overt landing and taxi lights. If the pilot determines there is sufficient illumination,
      he/she may call for aircraft lights out. Ensure 100 percent flaps (if used) are set prior to
      reaching glide slope intercept. Complete the Before Landing Checklist, but delay turning
      on NVG taxi and landing lights until directed by the pilot. Once established on approach
      speed, crosscheck drift and groundspeed to determine a predicted descent rate and to
      crosscheck crab.
      18.27.7.5. Setting Radar Altimeters. Prior to slowdown, the pilot should set 10 feet to
      help judge the last few feet above the runway. At slowdown, the navigator should set
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                   173


     300 feet to guard against shallow glideslopes. CAUTION: AC-130U. The Q-39 (MTV)
     will be stowed prior to landing.
  18.27.8. Descent:
     18.27.8.1. Do not descend below 300 feet AGL until the LZ environment is identified
     visually and confirmed by both pilots. Whoever identifies the LZ first will call out
     "ZONE IN SIGHT," its clock position, and any discrepancies noted (i.e., any lights out,
     etc.). Both pilots will then confirm the zone and use all available resources to crosscheck
     the alignment for the proper heading. WARNING: On blacked out runways (AMP-4), a
     go-around point will be identified during mission planning. NOTE: The IR sensor is
     helpful in LZ identification and aircraft alignment, but it will not be used as a primary
     flight reference during the SCA.
     18.27.8.2. The non-flying pilot will continue to monitor airspeed, descent rate, and bank
     angle. WARNING: Use of a 5-degree glideslope can cause descent rates in excess of
     1000 feet per minute. Extreme care must be taken to break high descent rates with
     application of power prior to touchdown. In no case will a descent below 300 feet AGL
     be initiated prior to 2 NM to touchdown. This would cause the glideslope to be too
     shallow.
  18.27.9. Go-Around and Departure Procedures. Pilots will initiate a go-around at the MAP
  (or pre-briefed location for visual approaches) if the runway is not in sight, a safe landing
  cannot be accomplished, or if directed. The latest go-around point for visual approaches is
  based on total landing distance and is that point at which the aircraft may land and safely stop
  on the runway.
     18.27.9.1. The navigator will advise the pilots upon arrival at the MAP and repeat the
     MSL altitude and initial heading required when the go-around is executed.
     18.27.9.2. The flying pilot will initiate the go-around and ensure a positive rate of climb
     is attained and verified by the non-flying pilot. Transition to instruments as necessary
     and be alert for visual illusions. WARNING: Pilots are more susceptible to spatial
     disorientation during NVG go-arounds and departures.
  18.27.10. Loss of NVGs and Spatial Disorientation:
     18.27.10.1. Airborne. If the pilot or copilot loses use of their NVGs inside of 1 NM,
     perform a go-around.
         18.27.10.1.1. If the flight engineer loses use of NVGs, land at the discretion of the
         aircraft commander. Use other crewmembers and all available sensors as necessary
         to clear for hazards and confirm the landing zone.
         18.27.10.1.2. After takeoff, continue the climb out and follow the appropriate
         procedures for loss of NVGs.
     18.27.10.2. On the Ground. The pilot will determine whether to continue the takeoff roll
     as applicable. The copilot should be prepared to turn on overt lighting at the direction of
     the aircraft commander in case of NVG failure during takeoff or landing roll.
     18.27.10.3. The non-flying pilot must be ready to immediately take control of the aircraft
     if the flying pilot experiences spatial disorientation or an NVG malfunction. When
174                                                          AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


      necessary, take the appropriate action required regardless of qualification. Situation
      permitting, start a climb to at least minimum safe altitude (MSA) until the pilot
      experiencing the problem is ready to assume flying or non-flying pilot duties.
  18.27.11. Overt Landings Following NVG Landings. If the sortie will continue with non-
  NVG VFR traffic patterns, the Post Low altitude checklist (if applicable) and the Touch and
  Go checklist will be accomplished.
  18.27.12. NVG Option Landing Procedures. Maneuver the aircraft to be wings level and
  configured at a minimum of 300 feet AGL and 1 NM final for a SCA or AMP-4 CR. Pilots
  will call the zone in sight as they turn final and navigator/flight engineer will make standard
  altitude advisory calls on descent.

              This clearance may be preplanned.
              2. At My Command: Add “AT MY COMMAND” on line 5. The gunship
              will call “READY TO FIRE” when ready.
              3. Adjust Fire: Only adjust first marking rounds or incorrect target. Adjust
              from impact by giving range (meters) and cardinal (North, South, East, West)
              direction.
              DO NOT:
              1. Do not ask the gunship to identify colors.
              2. Do not reference clock positions.
              3. Do not pass run-in headings/no-fire headings.
              4. Do not correct left/right or long/short.

                          J-LASER AND J-CAS COORDINATION

A7.1. When conducting CAS with lasers and pointers, always strive for simple communications.
Good preplanning, accurate target location, and reliable communications are essential. The
following guidance is from JP 3-09.1. An aircrew guide is provided in Figure A7.1.
A7.2. Normal laser designation time is 20 seconds maximum. The aircrew may request a
longer laser on time by saying “LASER ON” and time (e.g., “LASER ON, 30 SECONDS”).
The FAC should acknowledge the “LASER ON” call. The FAC may elect to turn the laser on 10
seconds after the “10 SECONDS” call without hearing the “LASER ON” call if problems are
expected. NOTE: The “10 SECONDS” call means the aircrew wants the laser on in
approximately 10 seconds. The FAC relays the call to the laser designation officer.
A7.3. The aircrew calls “SPOT” when acquiring the laser spot, confirming to the FAC and the
wingman the aircrew sees the designated target.
A7.4. Offset designation procedures may be used in a laser countermeasures environment.
Following the “LASER ON” call, a “SHIFT” call will be used to shift laser energy from the
offset position next to the target onto the target itself. The “SHIFT” call, when used, can replace
the “SPOT” call.
A7.5. The last call in the sequence is “TERMINATE. ” The pilot makes this call to turn the
laser off.
A7.6. Turning the Laser Off. Minimizing the time a laser is on is important in a laser
countermeasures environment and when employing battery operated laser designators. The laser
designator operator will turn the designator off:
   A7.6.1. When the “TERMINATE” call is heard.
   A7.6.2. When the weapon hits the target.
   A7.6.3. After 20 seconds (or longer, if required).
A7.7. Night IR Brevity CAS terminology will be followed anytime CAS is conducted with IR
pointers. See Figure A7.1.

                          jingle the IR beam on the target. This aids in
             SNAKE        confirming the friendly position and helps the
                          aircrew maintain sight of the target during conditions
                          when the IR beam/mark is difficult to see.
                          Terminal controller marks the target with an IR
             SPARKLE      pointer. Also used by AC-130 aircrews to mark with

                          AC-130 STANDARD TERMINOLOGY

A8.1. General. The following is a list of standard terminology used by sensor operators. It is
important to understand and use these terms in order to standardize aircraft communication
A8.2. Common.
   A8.2.1. TV/IR/RADAR’s TRACKING. Used to notify crew that the sensor operator is
   tracking.
   A8.2.2. TV/IR’s POPEYE. Used to notify the crew that the sensor operator can no longer
   see the target. This may be due to weather, another aircraft position, smoke or anything that
   comes between you and the target.
   A8.2.3. TV/IR/RADAR’s PULLED OFF. Used to notify the pilot that the sensor operator is
   not tracking due to aircraft position and/or system limitations.
   A8.2.4. TV/IR/RADAR’s COMPLETE. Used to notify the crew that the sensor operator has
   completed applicable slaving check operations.
A8.3. Live Fire.
   A8.3.1. TV/IR/RADAR’s SATISFIED THE RANGE IS CLEAR. Used to notify the FCO
   that a thorough search of the range has been accomplished.
   A8.3.2. NO JOY TV/IR. Used to notify the crew when the primary sensor operator didn’t
   see the round(s) impact the target area. If the other sensor operator observed the impacts
   they will make a shot call, if not they will also call “NO JOY.”
   A8.3.3. ACQUISITION/TRACK FAIL. Used to notify the crew when the radar did not
   PIPP the round.
   A8.3.4. NO GUN TV/IR/RADAR. Used to notify the FCO that the sensor operator has tried
   to fire the gun and after a reasonable amount of time the gun did not fire.
   A8.3.5. ____ FORWARD, ____ HIGH. All shot calls will be given in this format. AFT and
   LOW will be substituted when appropriate. The miss distance in mils will precede the
   FORWARD, AFT, HIGH, or LOW calls. Informational calls can be added to long burst to
   inform the pilot which way the rounds moved after the initial impact (i.e., 4 forward, 3 low,
   moving aft and down across the target).
   A8.3.6. WITHIN _____. Used to notify the crew what the miss distance in mils was when
   performing a shot correction.
   A8.3.7. DIRECT. Used to inform the crew of a direct hit on the target.
   A8.3.8. TV/IR/RADAR’s MOVING TO A NEW TARGET. Used when moving from target
   to target.
   A8.3.9. TARGET IS OBSCURED, MOVING TO A NEW TARGET. Self explanatory.
   A8.3.10. (AC-130H) LASER COMING ON.               Used to inform the crew that the laser
   designator is going to be fired.

   A8.3.11. LASER ON. Used to notify the crew that the laser designator is on.
   A8.3.12. LASER OFF. Used to notify the crew that the laser designator is off.
   A8.3.13. SPARKLE ON. Used to notify the crew that the IR pointer is ON.
   A8.3.14. SPARKLE OFF. Used to notify the crew that the IR pointer is OFF.
   A8.3.15. PILOT, TARGET IS MOVING PARALLEL FORWARD/AFT or PILOT
   TARGET IS MOVING PERPENDICULAR TOWARDS/AWAY. Used only when firing a
   fixed gun. Make the initial call to inform the crew on the direction of travel of the mover.
   This allows the pilot to adjust the guidance accordingly. Once moving target procedures are
   initiated, subsequent informational calls of PARALLEL FORWARD/AFT and
   PERPENDICULAR TOWARD/AFT will be made to inform the pilot of directional changes.
   Additional information calls may be given if there are significant changes in the LOC.
   A8.3.16. Sensor Guidance/Direction. Sensor operator’s can transition from sensor guidance
   to sensor direction at anytime using these terms, or from direction to guidance.
A8.4. Guidance:
   A8.4.1. PILOT, TAKE TV/IR GUIDANCE. Used to inform the pilot to transition to sensor
   guidance.
   A8.4.2. PILOT, TV/IR IS HOLDING A POINT, TAKE UP AN ORBIT ON IR/TV/RADAR
   GUIDANCE. Used to inform the pilot you are about to start searching a LOC and the
   guidance is going to change. Also used to inform the pilot that the sensor has stopped
   moving and needs the aircraft to roll-in on a point for an orbit.
   A8.4.3. PILOT, TV/IR IS MOVING OUT TO THE ____ (give a cardinal direction). Used
   to inform the pilot the sensor operator is starting a search.
A8.5. Direction:
   A8.5.1. PILOT, TAKE TV/IR/NAV DIRECTION. Used to inform the pilot to transition to
   sensor/navigator direction.
   A8.5.2. PILOT, PREPARE TO ROLL-OUT and PILOT, ROLL-OUT NOW. Used to
   inform the pilot that you are about to roll the aircraft out under TV/IR/NAV direction , or roll
   the aircraft out immediately under TV/IR/NAV/RADAR direction.
   A8.5.3. PILOT, ROLL-OUT ON ____, UNDER TV/IR/NAV DIRECTION. Used to give
   the pilot the initial roll-out heading, and also a reminder to fly the aircraft under sensor/NAV
   direction. The pilot will maintain heading until the sensor operator gives a new command or
   returns to sensor guidance.
   A8.5.4. PILOT, TV/IR IS HOLDING A POINT, ROLL-IN ON TV/IR DIRECTION. Used
   to inform the pilot the sensor has stopped moving and needs the aircraft to either roll-in on a
   point for an orbit, or momentarily until the aircraft is in position to continue on direction.
   A8.5.5. PILOT, ROLL-IN/OUT. Used to command the pilot to roll-in or roll-out
   immediately. This command is used to position the aircraft in the firing orbit or around a
   stationary point.
   A8.5.6. PILOT, FLY HEADING _____. Used to inform the pilot of a new heading.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                 203


  A8.5.7. ROLL-IN HARD. Use this command when you want the pilot to turn the aircraft
  hard into an orbit.
  A8.5.8. PILOT, GIVE ME A ___ DEGREE-TURN TO THE LEFT/RIGHT. Used to
  command the pilot to perform a turn the number of degrees requested to fly the aircraft closer
  to or farther away from an LOC. Most pilots know to turn as shallow as possible, but to
  remind them, you may ask for a FLAT TURN. Usually given in 5 or 10 degree increments.
  A8.5.9. PILOT, ROLL-IN TO A LOOSE ORBIT. Used to roll the aircraft into an orbit to
  enable the sensor to search an area or to regain his situational awareness.
  A8.5.10. MAINTAIN YOUR ORBIT AND DISREGARD YOUR GUIDANCE. This frees
  up the primary sensor to search around the area without having to tell the pilot about changes
  in guidance.

RESCUE PICKUP BRIEF EXPANDED CHECKLIST (15-LINE CHECKLIST) AND ON-
   SCENE COMMANDER DUTIES AND CONSIDERATIONS (OSC CHECKLIST)

A10.1. General. The information in the 15 – Line briefing need not be provided in order or
all at once. Items A10.2.1. - A10.3.1. (Sections A – B, 7 on Figure A10.1) are required prior to
the execution phase. All other information should be provided as applicable or as capable.
Reference A10.7 and Figure A10.2 for On-Scene Commander Duties.
A10.2. Survivor Information: High priority information provided by OSC/ AMC considered
necessary for mission execution.
   A10.2.1. Call Sign(s): Fragged call sign of each survivor or Isolated Personnel to include
   crew position designator. Example: Pilot on F-15E is Zorba 01A and WSO is Zorba 01B.
   A10.2.2. Number of Survivors: Ideally, this number will correspond to the number of call
   signs. However, if call signs are unknown or are incomplete, knowing the number of
   survivors will help rescue forces better plan the pickup.
   A10.2.3. Location(s): The location of each survivor in Lat/Long, UTM/MGRS grid, or
   range and bearing from a known point (SARDOT, waypoint, etc.). Provide the
   coordinates/range and bearing in the original, format as received from the source (HOOK
   112 GPS coordinates, wingman's overflight, etc.). Also, provide the source of the location by
   circling the appropriate descriptor (GPS, Map, Flyover, Other). For example, if an aircraft
   flew over the survivor and recorded the position, circle flyover. If given GPS coordinates
   from the survivor, circle GPS. The source of information can be critical when loading into
   navigation systems due to the different datums and navigation system defaults. Having the
   information in its original format will limit errors induced by various conversions that are
   handed down from one controlling agency to another.
   A10.2.4. Condition/Injuries: Most important is can they walk or not? Answer YES or NO.
   This will assist the recovery vehicle in determining the amount of time the ground team will
   need. If time permits, provide additional information concerning the type and extent of
   injuries.
   A10.2.5. Equipment: PRC-90, PRC-112, or other type of radio? PRC-112 code number?
   Signaling devices available to survivor?
   A10.2.6. Authentication Complete?      YES or NO and how the authentication was
   accomplished (ISOPREP data, letter of the day, etc.). Inform rescue forces of authentication
   information previously used and compromised, to include ISOPREP data, SAR word, letter,
   or number of the day.
A10.3. Recovery Area Information: Only item A10.3.1. of this section is considered
necessary for mission execution.
   A10.3.1. Threats: Survivor area threats which will affect the recovery vehicle or
   RESCORT. Include enemy foot soldiers, tanks/armored vehicles, known or suspected
   chemical/radiation hazards, anti aircraft artillery, surface to air missiles, etc., Include enroute
   threats during ingress and egress if known.
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                    207


   A10.3.2. Elevation: Provide the MSL altitude (to nearest 1000 ft) of the survivor location if
   known. Elevation is critical if above 4000 ft MSL and/or surface air temperature is 25
   degrees Celsius or greater. These factors are used for calculating the recovery vehicle's
   power available and power required for various hover heights.
   A10.3.3. Description: Some possible descriptors: flat, rocky, hilly, sloped, 80 foot trees,
   valley, ridgeline. For example, “Zorba 01B is on the south slope of an east/west running
   ridgeline halfway up in rocky terrain.”
A10.4. RESCORT Plan: If RESCORT is available, this information will be passed to the
recovery vehicle prior to mission execution if available/required. This information is not critical
but may help increase situational awareness and avoid confusion or unnecessary radio calls
during execution, especially if RESCORT and the recovery vehicle(s) are not familiar with each
other's operating procedures.
   A10.4.1. IP: Provide the initial point, anchor point, or hold point beyond which the recovery
   vehicle(s) will not go until the pickup brief is complete to the satisfaction of the recovery
   vehicle flight lead. This could be a preplanned waypoint, a landmark, range/bearing, etc.
   Ingress/egress routes should avoid exposure to threats to the recovery vehicle. Use spider
   points/routes if available.
       A10.4.1.1. Ingress Route: Provide the ingress route from the rescue vehicle's present
       position to the IP.
       A10.4.1.2. Egress Route: Provide an egress route from the survivor location to a
       planned exit point, FEBA/FLOT crossing, etc.
   A10.4.2. Ordnance: What type of munitions will be used at what points during the ingress,
   pickup, and/or egress? How close to rescue forces will munitions be employed? Specify how
   to coordinate fire if RESCORT is blind on the recovery vehicle(s).
   A10.4.3. Tactics: RESCORT patterns or any other tactics which may need to be coordinated
   with the recovery vehicle(s).
A10.5. Recovery Vehicle Plan: This information will be provided by recovery vehicle flight
lead to RESCORT if available.
   A10.5.1. Tactics: Provide any recovery vehicle formation tactics to include formation
   spread to be used during the ingress, pickup, and egress. RESCORT should know where
   recovery vehicle wingman will be at all times to allow weapons employment while
   minimizing the chance of fratricide. Inform RESCORT of the intent to execute simultaneous
   survivor recoveries and the hold point for the wingman if applicable. Provide any mission
   impacting limitations such as no hover capability due to power limitations.
   A10.5.2. Comm/Signaling Procedures: Coordinate the following for the survivor area: the
   passing of specific OSC duties from RESCORT to the recovery vehicle and back, who has
   control of the survivor frequency, and who is responsible for coordinating survivor signaling
   and when.
A10.6. Additional Items/Questions: Before execution allow for questions or additional
information inputs by RESCORT or the recovery vehicle(s). This is the catch-all to ensure
mission-essential information does not get left out.

                            HOT REFUELING OPERATIONS

A13.1. General. For AFSOC aircrews, basic hot refueling is the transfer of fuel (refuel or
defuel) at sites where all required equipment is provided at the site. AFSOC aircrews qualified
in hot refueling may refuel/defuel at fixed-sites, refuel/defuel with approved fuel trucks and
receive fuel from a fixed-wing tanker at FARP sites. NVG-qualified AFSOC aircrews may
conduct hot refueling operations under NVG conditions. A comprehensive mission briefing and
strict compliance with these procedures will ensure an expeditious safe refueling operation.
Personnel performing hot refueling operations will have a thorough knowledge of T.O. 00-25-
172, specifically section II (Electrostatic Hazards), section III (Bonding), and section VII
(Combat or Contingency Operations). Personnel operating refueling equipment during blacked-
out operations must be Night Vision Goggle (NVG) qualified. All Air Force personnel involved
with hot refueling operations will be trained IAW appropriate command directives. Prior to
conducting hot refueling operations, ensure:
   A13.1.1. Refueling operations at Air Force hot refueling sites will not be conducted within
   200 feet of aircraft parking areas, 50 feet of taxiing aircraft, or 200 feet of inhabited or
   uninhabited buildings. NOTE: All hot refueling sites will have a current site survey and
   meet minimum unobstructed egress distances required by the survey to ensure the aircraft
   can taxi from the site in the event of an emergency. If the egress distance is less than the
   required minimum or the egress area is obstructed, tanker/receiver aircraft will perform
   refueling/defueling in a cold environment only.
   A13.1.2. Only current and qualified crewmembers will be allowed to occupy a primary crew
   position on hot refueling missions. Normally these missions will be conducted with a NVG
   tactical/operational crew.
A13.2. Minimum Crew Compliment.
   A13.2.1. Pilot - 2
   A13.2.2. Flight engineer – 1
   A13.2.3. Loadmaster – 1. NOTE: The pilot, copilot, and flight engineer will remain on the
   flight deck in the event of an emergency taxi, i.e., moving the aircraft. These crew positions
   are the minimum required to fly the aircraft.
A13.3. Aircraft Commander Duties. The aircraft commander will:
   A13.3.1. Ensure approval has been granted by the proper authority prior to conducting hot
   refueling operations.
   A13.3.2. Ensure all crewmembers are briefed on their specific responsibilities.
   A13.3.3. Analyze runway availability prior to landing to determine braking action.
   Unnecessary or heavy braking could delay hot refueling operations.
   A13.3.4. Analyze planned hot refueling area for hazards and sufficient taxi clearances.
   A13.3.5. Determine fuel requirements to include estimated onload and offload.
A13.4. Flight Engineer (FE) Duties. The flight engineer will:
 220                                                            AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


   A13.4.1. Read and ensure compliance with the hot refueling checklist.
   A13.4.2. Control fuel distribution and the Single Point Refueling (SPR) drain pump on
   Universal Aerial Refueling Receptacle Slipway Installation (UARRSI) modified aircraft.
   A13.4.3. Coordinate fuel distribution with the loadmaster on Non-UARRSI aircraft.
A13.5. Loadmaster (LM) Duties. The LM is responsible for supervising fuel servicing
operations. The loadmaster will:
   A13.5.1. Ensure compliance with all safety procedures.
   A13.5.2. Immediately inform the pilot and advise the crew on recommended course of
   action, in the event of a hazardous situation/emergency.
   A13.5.3. Ensure all required equipment is on board prior to and after hot refueling
   operations.
   A13.5.4. Operate the ramp and door or paratroop door as required.
   A13.5.5. Complete the hot brake/hung flare check prior to commencing hot refueling
   operations.
   A13.5.6. Ensure all personnel are properly briefed on fueling procedures.
   A13.5.7. Operate the SPR panel and control fuel distribution with coordination from the
   flight engineer. EXCEPTION: On UARRSI modified aircraft the flight engineer will
   control fuel distribution.
   A13.5.8. Perform leak check at SPR panel.
   A13.5.9. Secure aircraft for departure after all equipment and personnel are aboard.
A13.6. Hot refueling Equipment. The hot refueling mission requires specific equipment and
inspections prior to commencing operations. Only equipment approved IAW TO 00-25-172, TO
37A9-7-2-1, and in the System Safety Engineering Analysis (SSEA) shall be used. This
equipment is unique in that it provides for an internal bond that is not provided for with
conventional refueling equipment. If unapproved equipment is used, the refueling operation
must be accomplished without engines running (cold refueling).
   A13.6.1. Those personnel who will have direct contact with fueling operations during hot
   refueling will have the following:
       A13.6.1.1. Spare flight gloves.
       A13.6.1.2. Extra flight suit or change of clothing, including flight boots.
       A13.6.1.3. Full canteen, to be carried on your person.
       A13.6.1.4. Sealable water and fuel resistant garment bag to store fuel soaked clothing.
       A13.6.1.5. NVGs with spare battery (as required).
       A13.6.1.6. Dust goggles (as required).
       A13.6.1.7. Survival vest (as required).
       A13.6.1.8. Overt/IR chem-lights (as required).
AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010                                                                     221


       A13.6.1.9. IR compatible flashlight (as required).
A13.7. Weather Requirements. For training operations and exercises, stop fuel servicing
when high winds or reduced visibility caused by blowing rain, snow, or sand exists or when an
electrical storm is within a five mile radius of the hot refueling site.
A13.8. Safety. Aircrews will adhere to the following guidance to ensure a safe Hot Refueling
Operation:
   A13.8.1. If a ground is not available at a forward operating location or remote site, aircraft
   will be bonded to servicing equipment during actual servicing. Bonding will be
   accomplished by inserting the bonding plug into the receiver aircraft’s external receptacle
   prior to any other action.
   A13.8.2. Personnel involved in servicing operations will be trained in portable fire
   extinguishers and installed equipment fire suppression system operations.
   A13.8.3. If hot refueling operations are being conducted at an AFSOC or AMC certified site,
   a minimum of one 20-pound dry chemical will be located in the immediate vicinity of the
   aircraft SPR and the fuel servicing equipment. Additionally, a crash fire rescue vehicle will
   be on standby just outside the fuel servicing safety zone. If a fuel truck is used as the tanker,
   a large flight line Halon 1211 fire extinguisher will be used in lieu of the 20-pound
   extinguisher.
   A13.8.4. For exercises or contingencies where a crash fire vehicle cannot be provided, a
   minimum of one 20-pound dry chemical extinguisher will be positioned at the receiver SPR
   and the refueling source.
   A13.8.5. The wear of Gortex is authorized for aircraft servicing with JP-5/8/10, Jet-A, and
   diesel fuel (including mixed fuel criteria). Personnel will not wear Gortex within 50-feet
   when servicing aircraft with JP-4 or ground servicing with Mogas.
   A13.8.6. General Ordnance Procedures. Aircraft may be hot refueled with live ordnance
   aboard, however upload/download of ordnance and refueling of aircraft will normally be
   conducted as separate operations; a separate area should be established at least 300 feet from
   the hot refueling site. During combat or contingency operations, concurrent refueling and
   upload / download of ordnance may be authorized when, in the judgment of the mission
   commander, operational necessity and benefits of reducing ground time outweigh the risks
   involved.
   A13.8.7. Radar, radar altimeters, Doppler or Doppler Velocity Sensor, and ECM equipment
   will not be operated within the refueling area.
   A13.8.8. Any hand-held radios used within the fuel spillage safety zone must be intrinsically
   safe. HF radio transmissions are not allowed within the fuel spillage safety zone during
   refueling operations.
   A13.8.9. Voice communication contact between the loadmaster and cockpit will be
   maintained at all times. Exception: The loadmaster does not have to maintain interphone
   contact while positioning/repositioning refueling equipment, but will be on interphone any
   time the refueling nozzle is connected to the aircraft and the switches on the SPR panel are in
   a position other than off or closed.
 222                                                        AFI11-2AC-130V3 9 JUNE 2010


A13.9. Aircraft Marshaling:
   A13.9.1. When CCT/STS are responsible for primary air traffic control of an airfield, they
   will marshal and control all aircraft movement into the hot refueling site. If CCT/STS are
   not available, all aircraft are responsible for self marshaling into the hot refueling site.
   A13.9.2. Aircraft commanders must ensure marshaling procedures are thoroughly pre-
   briefed between all agencies involved prior to hot refueling operations. These procedures
   must be strictly adhered to at all times, to ensure all safety requirements are met.
A13.10. Emergency Procedures. Emergency procedures are published in the applicable
checklist. They will be reviewed by all crewmembers and briefed by the PIC prior to
commencing hot refueling operations. All personnel, including ground controllers, will know
the ground evacuation plans. Stop all hot refueling operations immediately when a leak, unsafe
condition, or system malfunction occurs. Correct the deficiency before resuming hot refueling
operations.
