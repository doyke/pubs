1. Responsibilities
     1.1. The Wing Planning Process. This section provides an overview of the wing planning
     process and the interrelationships of the necessary agencies involved. This process is
     designed to facilitate the development, maintenance, and updating of all wing plans. This
     instruction only applies to wing-level plans (plans in which multiple wing agencies are
     tasked and which are signed by the Wing Commander (22 ARW/CC)). Individual unit plans
     may use this document as a guide.
     1.2. Responsibilities. This section spells out specific responsibilities of each agency in the
     planning process.

             1.2.2.3. In conjunction with 22 ARW/XP, review all wing plans before final
             submission, publication, and distribution. Ensure all reviews have been coordinated
             appropriately (See para 2.9.).
             1.2.2.4. Ensure proper distribution of wing plans to tasked organizations, HQ Air
             Mobility Command (AMC), 18th Air Force, and any other HHQ organization, as
             required.
        1.2.3. 22 ARW Commanders. Commanders at group and squadron levels, as well as
        staff agency chiefs, are integral to the plans process. Commanders/Agency Chiefs, will:
MCCONNELLAFBI10-401 2 AUGUST 2010                                                             3


         1.2.3.1. Ensure Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for any unit developed wing
         plan is familiar with this instruction and the processes described herein.
         1.2.3.2. Ensure tasked organizations from within their unit are familiar with all wing
         plans distributed to their unit.
     1.2.4. Wing plan OPR. A Wing plan OPR is an agency that is responsible for the
     development and maintenance of a 22 ARW plan. Plan OPRs will:
         1.2.4.1. Notify 22 ARW/XP of the intent to produce or change a wing plan or annex
         in accordance with the annual review schedule or other applicable guidance (HHQ
         directive, etc.)
         1.2.4.2. Comply with the procedures and formats in this instruction and all applicable
         referenced publications when preparing a new plan, revising a current plan, or issuing
         a change to an existing plan.
         1.2.4.3. Conduct an annual review of all plans for which the organization is OPR in
         accordance with the schedule published by 22 ARW/XP or when governing directives
         dictate.
             1.2.4.3.1. Ensure plans are reviewed by the following agencies, in addition to
             tasked organizations:
                 1.2.4.3.1.1. 22 ARW Judge Advocates (JA) office.
                 1.2.4.3.1.2. 22 ARW Operations Security (OPSEC) program manager.
                 1.2.4.3.1.3. 22 ARW Antiterrorism office (22 ARW/XPA).
                 1.2.4.3.1.4. 22 ARW Information Protection office (22 ARW/IP).
                 1.2.4.3.1.5. 22 Civil Engineering Squadron (CES) Emergency Management
                 office (22 CES/CEX).
             1.2.4.3.2. Document annual review on the Record of Review page within the
             plan, see para 3.1.4. and Attachment 2, A2.4 for an example.
         1.2.4.4. When significant changes are required within the plan, revise it accordingly.
         Changes must be coordinated with affected tasked organizations (this may be
         accomplished through a working group, etc.). Review of the changes must be IAW
         para 1.2.4.3.1.
         1.2.4.5. Provide 22 ARW/XP an electronic copy of all new/revised plans.
         1.2.4.6. Monitor all plan preparation, review, revision and change actions through
         appropriate suspense deadlines, as well as follow-up actions.
         1.2.4.7. Coordinate changes/reviews with all tasked organizations within the plan to
         ensure they are familiar with and are capable of accomplishing the plan as written.
  1.3. Plans Maintenance. Each 22 ARW unit identified on the distribution of, or are tasked
  under a Wing plan will maintain a copy of it. . Electronic copies suffice; however, units must
  reference the 22 ARW/XP Index to ensure the most current copy is valid.
  1.4. OPSEC. Protection of Critical Information (CI) within 22 ARW plans and the
  correspondence thereof is vital to security and mission accomplishment. While plan OPRs
 4                                                MCCONNELLAFBI10-401 2 AUGUST 2010


     must incorporate a strong sense of OPSEC responsibility into their respective plans, all 22
     ARW members are responsible for ensuring sound OPSEC principles are used in the
     accomplishment of the plan.
     1.5. Classified storage. 22 ARW is tasked to support several classified plans. Units that do
     not maintain a sufficient amount of classified material to justify a safe, may maintain copies
     of their classified plans or classified plans for which they are tasked, at 22 ARW/XP, or the
     Wing Operations branch (22 ARW/XPO). Paper copy plans and notes must be placed in a
     sealed envelope marked with the unit, highest classification held, and the date submitted. 22
     ARW/XP may also maintain electronic copies of classified plans which units may work
     from.
     1.6. Sensitive Unclassified Information storage. Plans containing sensitive or critical
     information are designated for official use only (FOUO) and require protection against public
     disclosure. See DoDR 5400.7, DOD Freedom of Information Act Program/AF Sup 1 and
     DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, for safeguard requirements.
2. Preparing and Updating Plans.
     2.1. Plans Development. Anyone with knowledge of a requirement to produce a plan should
     notify 22 ARW/XP to ensure proper coordination and tracking.
     2.2. OPR Determination. The OPR for 22 ARW plans is determined by the source
     document requiring the plan.
     2.3. Identifying Plans. 22 ARW plans are assigned a number and/or title to coincide with the
     number and title of the higher headquarters plans they support or as specified by directive, if
     applicable. If there is no higher headquarters directive, or it is a base-level plan, see 22
     ARW/XP for identification guidance prior to proceeding with coordination.
        2.3.1. Many plans are incorrectly labeled as ―OPLAN‖. Operational Plans (OPLAN) are
        defined by AFMAN 10-401V1, Operation Plan and Concept Plan Development and
        Implementation.
        2.3.2. A base level plan that does not support a higher headquarters (HHQ) plan will be
        labeled as such, e.g. 22 ARW Installation Deployment Plan. For further guidance,
        consult AFMAN 10-401V1, Operation Plan and Concept Plan Development and
        Implementation, AFMAN 10-401V2, Planning Formats and Guidance, or Joint
        Operation Planning and Execution System Volume 2 (JOPESV2). If a plan OPR
        determines there is a conflict between this instruction and any higher headquarters
        guidance, comply with HHQ requirements and notify 22 ARW/XP immediately for
        resolution and documentation.
     2.4. Plan Format. 22 ARW plans are written in the format described in this instruction
     unless otherwise prescribed in a higher headquarters directive. This instruction is based on
     AFMAN 10-401 and follows that format. Sample plan formats and administrative details are
     provided in Chapter 3. Deviation should be kept to a minimum to maintain standardization.
     Refer to DoD 5200.1-PH, DoD Guide for Marking Classified Documents, and Information
     Security Oversight Office (ISOO), Marking Classified National Security Information Guide
     for additional guidance on the preparation and marking plans that are classified.
MCCONNELLAFBI10-401 2 AUGUST 2010                                                             5


  2.5. Plan Suspenses. Plan OPRs must make every effort to meet suspense deadlines for
  annual reviews, changes, and revisions. Because of the coordination with tasked
  organization and agencies identified in para 1.2.4.3.1., review coordination should be started
  early, and tracked by plan OPRs to ensure reviews are accomplished on time. 22 ARW/XP
  will contact units failing to meet the suspense to determine the current status. Units not
  responding with justification for the delay will be identified as such. A formal HHQ plan
  tasking requires sufficient lead time to ensure suspense deadlines are met. Local suspense
  will be determined by the amount of lead time provided by HHQ. All suspense requirements
  can only be achieved with the full cooperation of all 22 ARW commanders, the Wing Plans
  staff and plan OPRs.
  2.6. Plan Preparation Process. Any unit tasked to develop a plan should first consult 22
  ARW/XP to determine if a similar document already exists; as a plan, Operating Instruction
  (OI), etc. The unit will then gather the necessary information, establish required working
  groups from the tasked organizations, as required, to build the plan according to the guidance
  in this instruction & HHQ direction. Refer to para 2.9 for coordination procedures.
  2.7. Plan Review Process. A plan must be reviewed annually, unless directed otherwise. 22
  ARW/XP will remind OPRs when their plans are coming up for review. 22 ARW/XP will
  help accomplish the annual review, if the OPR requests assistance. Plan reviews are
  documented by OPR signature and date on the review page at the front of the document.
  Signature indicates that no significant changes are required at the time of the review, based
  on inputs from all tasked organizations, as well as the agencies identified in para 1.2.4.3.1.
  Review of a plan does not require a change to the date of the plan. Plan OPRs should start
  the review process (See Attachment 3) as early as 60-90 days before it is due.
     2.7.1. Issuing Changes Following Plan Review. During a plan review, OPRs must seek
     inputs from tasked organizations and when significant changes are required, must revise
     the wing plan. See para 2.8.
         2.7.1.1. Significant Changes. Changes that affect how a process works are
         considered significant changes. Changes in office symbol, phone number/building
         number changes, acronym changes, etc. that do not affect the process itself do not
         require a revision to the plan, nor Wg/CC approval. The 22 ARW Chief of Plans and
         Programs may sign the Memorandum of Transmittal and approve those types of
         changes (See para 3.1.2.).
         2.7.1.2. Memorandum of Transmittal. The date of the change, the date of the basic
         plan, and the classification of the plan must be included in paragraph 1. of the
         Memorandum of Transmittal.
             2.7.1.2.1. A copy of the distribution list must be attached to the Memorandum of
             Transmittal. If a new Annex Z is accomplished, a distribution list is not required.
             The ―To‖ element should read: ―See Attached Distribution List‖ or ―See Annex
             Z‖.
             2.7.1.2.2. For page changes (non-significant), the change number and date of the
             change must be placed in the footer of the page with changes. The change will
             be annotated on the Security Instructions and Record of Reviews along with the
             date of the review.
6                                                MCCONNELLAFBI10-401 2 AUGUST 2010


               2.7.1.2.3. Unit commanders or equivalent, and staff agency chiefs set procedures
               for internal control of classified material. When entering classified material into a
               mail distribution system, a receipt is required. Personnel may use AF Form 310,
               Document Receipt and Destruction Certificate as a receipt.
       2.7.2. Change Transmittal. A Memorandum of Transmittal is required for each revision,
       signed by the Wg/CC, or appropriate approval authority. The change is then distributed
       according to Annex Z, and adjusted in the Wing Plans Index.
       2.7.3. Page Changes. Page changes are the most efficient method of issuing changes to a
       plan without re-writing the plan in its entirety. This method re-accomplishes all pages
       containing changes, leaving unaffected pages unchanged. To indicate new or changed
       material, a vertical line is added in the left margin and the footer is annotated
       appropriately (See Attachment 2, A2.10 for a page change example). These are effective
       for changes that are not significant (See para 2.7.1.1.). In the case of electronic only
       distribution, OPRs should send out the complete plan rather than just the changed pages.
       2.7.4. Out-of-cycle Review. The 22 ARW/XP may initiate an out-of-cycle review of any
       wing plan. Plan OPRs may initiate out-of-cycle reviews for their plans. Out-of-cycle
       reviews are reviews of a plan that do not fall on their normal annual review cycle.
    2.8. Plan Revision Process. A plan revision is required for any significant change IAW para
    2.7.1.1. The revision process follows the review process, documented in Attachment 3. Plan
    format is described in Chapter 3. Comply with all checklist steps and information in this
    instruction when preparing a plan revision. When a plan revision is accomplished, the
    publication date of the plan will change. Follow coordination steps as outlined in paragraph
    2.9. to accomplish a plan revision.
    2.9. Plan Coordination Process.
       2.9.1. Plans will be coordinated using Suspense Tracking and Control System
       (STACSWeb) or other wing approved staffing process. All new wing plans and revisions
       must be coordinated through all Group Commanders, the director of staff, and, as
       applicable, the 931st Air Refueling Group (931 ARG) and 184th Intelligence Wing (184
       IW) Commanders. Inputs from either of these organizations must be addressed (either
       changed or justified as is). Once all changes have been made, the plan must be sent to the
       organizations listed in para 1.2.4.3.1. prior to being routed via 22 ARW/XP for
       submission to the Wing Staff for approval. All documentation of Group Commander,
       etc. review must accompany the plan.
       2.9.2. Wing Commander Approval. The Wing Commander must approve all new plans
       and all revisions to current wing plans. All wing plans must be reviewed by 22 ARW/XP
       prior to being submitted for final approval coordination. Digital signatures at every level
       are authorized to show approval.
    2.10. Hardcopy Reproduction and Distribution. All plans may be distributed electronically.
    Any unit may produce a hard copy of a wing plan with approval from the plan OPR. Careful
    attention must be paid to the Wing Plan Index to ensure units are operating off of the most
    current plan. Classified plans will be maintained only by the OPR except on a case-by-case
    basis. Hardcopy classified plans must be numbered and accounted for appropriately to
    ensure all copies are accounted for at all times.
MCCONNELLAFBI10-401 2 AUGUST 2010                                                                  7



3. Plan Format.
   3.1. Plan Elements. Plans are comprised of a number of elements including a cover, letter of
   transmittal, security instructions (with record of review), plan summary, table of contents,
   basic plan, annexes, appendices, tabs, and distribution change letter. All 22 ARW plans will
   include these elements in the order listed, unless specified otherwise in HHQ directives.
      3.1.1. Plan Cover. The front cover must show the date of the plan, the issuing
      headquarters, long title, and the number of the plan, if applicable. See paragraph 3.3.,
      DoD 5200.1-PH and ISOO Marking Classified National Security Information Guide for
      instructions on properly marking the classification of the plan cover. See Attachment 2,
      A2.1 for proper format. For classified plans include a ―declassify on‖ statement, and
      source of classification.
      3.1.2. Memorandum of Transmittal. The Memorandum of Transmittal of a plan should
      identify the reason for preparing the plan. The need for preparing further supporting
      plans must be specified as well. The OPR for the plan must be identified and disposition
      instructions must be included when the plan supersedes a previous version of the plan.
      The Memorandum of Transmittal is not page numbered and is signed by the Chief, Wing
      Plans and Programs (22 ARW/XP). The date of the transmittal letter should be the same
      as that of the plan. Attachment 2, A2.2 contains an example of a Memorandum of
      Transmittal.
      3.1.3. Distribution Change Memorandum.          All plans will include a standard
      memorandum that addressees may use to notify the OPR and 22 ARW/XP of changes in
      distribution requirements. The Distribution Change Memorandum is not page numbered
      and will follow the Memorandum of Transmittal in 22 ARW plans. Refer to Attachment
      2, A2.3 for an example of a Distribution Change Memorandum.
      3.1.4. Security Instructions and Record of Reviews. The Security Instructions and
      Record of Review page is the first numbered page (numbered with lower case roman
      numerals; e.g. i, ii, iii, iv, etc.). The security instructions must include the long and short
      titles of the plan and should state any reproduction limitations. Attachment 2, A2.4 is an
      example of a Security Instructions and Record of Review format.
      3.1.5. Plan Summary. The plan summary is used for all plans. It provides a brief
      overview of the mission, general situation, concept of operations, and commander‘s
      appraisal of the logistics and personnel feasibility of the plan. Refer to Attachment 2,
      A2.5 for an example. The paragraphs indicated in the example are mandatory;
      subparagraphs are at the discretion of the OPR. The Plan Summary page numbering
      should continue from the Security Instructions and Record of Reviews numbering.
      3.1.6. Table of Contents. The Table of Contents will list the first page of each element.
      It will also include elements published separately (such as classified annexes). The table
      of contents should contain a listing of all annexes, appendices, tabs, exhibits, and maps.
      An example can be found in Attachment 2, A2.6. The Table of Contents page numbering
      should continue from the Plan Summary.

      3.1.7. Basic Plan. The basic plan consists of the five major paragraphs shown in
      Attachment 2, A2.7. All five paragraphs must be included, even if they are not
      applicable. If they do not apply, insert the statement ―Not Applicable‖ as shown in the
      example. Major paragraphs other than these five should not be made. All portions of the
      plan should work within one of the five major paragraphs. Annexes used in the plan
      should be listed on the final page of the basic plan. The Basic Plan page numbering
      should start over using Arabic numerals (1,2,3, etc.).
      3.1.8. Attachments. Attachments to the basic plan listed in order of increasing detail are:
      Annexes, Appendices, Tabs, and Exhibits. The basic plan may refer to the attachments to
      preclude repeating information. Other attachments (appendices, tabs, exhibits, or maps)
      are listed on the final page of any attachment that has further attachments (e.g. any
      appendices/tabs/exhibits/maps associated with Annex A should be listed on the final page
      of Annex A).
         3.1.8.1. Annex. Each Annex is produced by a specific functional area (Operations,
         Logistics, etc.) and describes their role in the plan. It contains detailed information
         for a specific organization (or function in the case of Annex A or Z). Annexes are
         formatted in a similar fashion as the Basic plan and should include the five major
         paragraphs (See AFMAN 10-401V2 for some variations). All 22 ARW plans will
         contain, as a minimum, Annex A (Task Organization), Operations Security Appendix
         to Annex C (and subsequently must contain an Annex C), and Annex Z
         (Distribution). Per AFMAN 10-401, Annexes I, O and R must not be used. Refer to
         Table 1 for a complete listing of Annexes. Annexes for all plans must follow the list
         as given in Table 1 (i.e. Annex A is always Task Organization, Annex Z is always
         Distribution, etc.). If an annex does not apply to the plan, do not include it (annotated
         in the table of contents). Annexes should be page numbered by Annex (e.g. A-1
         should be the page number of the first page of Annex A, while B-3 would be the third
         page of Annex B.).Table 1 List of Annexes

             3.1.8.1.1. The task organization annex lists all units that are required to act on the
             contents of the plan. See Attachment 2, A2.8 for an example of a task
             organization annex.
             3.1.8.1.2. Operations. This annex details the Operations section of the plan.
             Included in this annex is an Appendix for OPSEC (See para 3.1.8.2.1.).
             3.1.8.1.3. Distribution List. The distribution list must include all tasked
             organizations, 22 ARW/XP and 22 ARW/CP as a minimum (See Attachment 2,
             A2.9). Also see para 2.7.1.2.3.
         3.1.8.2. Appendix. An appendix is a subordinate addition to an annex. Normally,
         each appendix is devoted to a major category of information that falls under the
         appropriate Annex. Appendices should be page numbered according to Annex (e.g.
         page 3 of Appendix 2 of Annex A should be A-2-3, and page 12 of Appendix 1 of
         Annex L would be L-1-12, etc.).
             3.1.8.2.1. OPSEC. OPSEC is discussed briefly in the Plan Summary and the
             Basic Plan. Ensure OPSEC is addressed as an Appendix to Annex C. See your
             unit or Wing OPSEC point of contact (POC) for guidance.
         3.1.8.3. Tab. A Tab is a further subdivision of an appendix used to organize and
         clarify the presentation of detailed data. Tabs are prepared in the same general format
         as appendices. Page numbering for Tabs follows suit with appendices of annexes
         (e.g. page 3 of Tab B to Appendix 1 to Annex C would be C-1-B-3).
         3.1.8.4. Exhibit. An exhibit is a further subdivision of a tab to enable the planner to
         organize the portrayal of even greater levels of detail. Page numbers for exhibits
         follow suit with tabs to appendices of annexes (e.g. page 1 of exhibit 2 to Tab A to
         Appendix 3 of Annex M would be M-3-A-2-1).
  3.2. References. List documents that are required for complete understanding of the
  attachment. Do not duplicate references in attachments that are listed in the basic plan. See
  AFMAN 10-401 for additional information.
  3.3. Plan Marking. It is imperative that plans are marked for appropriate classification. The
  classification level will be displayed on the front and back cover as well as on the top and
  bottom of each page. For classified plans, the annotations should be printed in the color
  associated with the classification of the document. Additionally, for classified documents,
  each paragraph must be annotated with its commensurate classification. See DoD 5200.1-PH
  and ISOO Marking Classified National Security Information Guide for additional guidance.

   3.4. Paragraph Numbering. Designations for subdividing, numbering, and lettering
   paragraphs will use either an alphanumeric system (e.g. 1.a.(1)(a), etc.) or a numeric system
   (e.g. 2.3.4.2.). The plan OPR will determine which numbering system best suits their plan,
   but it should follow the numbering used in the HHQ parent document, if applicable. Each
   progressive subdivision should be indented an additional five spaces.
   3.5. Page Numbering. Each new ‗section‘ (e.g. basic plan, annex, appendix, etc.) must start
   on the front of a page (i.e. odd page). If the ‗section‘ preceding ends on an odd page, a blank
   page must be inserted to maintain conformity. The blank pages will include the phrase
   ―(INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK)‖ or other suitable substitute, but will contain a page
   number.      Plan covers, Memorandums of Transmittal, and Distribution Change
   Memorandums (not page numbered) will stand alone and will have nothing printed on the
   back.
   3.6. Capitalization and Underlining Guidance.
      3.6.1. References to specific annexes and other attachments will use Initial Capitals (e.g.
      Figure 3, Annex A, etc.).
      3.6.2. Paragraph titles are all capitalized and underlined (e.g. PURPOSE)
      3.6.3. Subparagraph titles are Initial Capitalized and underlined (e.g.               Legal
      Considerations)
      3.6.4. Sub-subparagraph titles are Initial Capitalized only. An exception to this rule
      applies where agencies are identified or tasked, then they will be all CAPS.
   3.7. Text spacing and sizing. Text is single spaced, Times New Roman, 12 pitch font, with 6
   pt spacing following paragraphs. Margins will be set to 1 inch. Plan OPRs may opt to use a
   different format as necessary to make tables fit within margins of a page, etc., however the
   document should remain legible (recommend no less than size 10 font).
   3.8. Dates. Each separate element of a plan must bear the date of issue or revision. Until a
   plan is revised, all elements should bear the same date of issue.
   3.9. Abbreviations/Acronyms. The first time a title, designation, or acronym is used in each
   element of a plan that is not contained in the glossary, it must be spelled out and immediately
   followed by the approved abbreviation/acronym (e.g. Crisis Action Team (CAT)). From that
   point forward in that element, the abbreviation may stand alone.
4. Prescribed Forms/IMT’s: No Forms or IMT‘s prescribed by this publication.
5. Adopted Forms/IMT’s: AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication.

        PLAN SUMMARY

        1. PURPOSE: Briefly describe the reason for implementing the plan and the specific objective it is
            intended to accomplish.
        2. CONDITIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION.
             a. Situation. Summarize the situation in which the plan should be considered for implementation.
        This summary should give decision-makers a recapitulation of the major aspects of the plans. The
        information should be reviewed and, if necessary, updated before its use in adapting a course of
        action in a given situation.
            b. Legal Considerations. Briefly summarize any legal considerations that may impact
        implementation.
        3. OPERATIONS TO BE CONDUCTED. Summarize operations conducted upon implementation.
        4. KEY ASSUMPTIONS. List the key assumptions that are absolutely essential to the logic of the
        plan.
        5. OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS. List major factors that may impede implementing the plan, if
        applicable.
        6. OPSEC. Summarize OPSEC considerations which significantly impact the conduct of the
        operation. If the operation is unclassified and only normal OPSEC considerations apply, enter
        ―Normal.‖ As a minimum, use the following statement to emphasize the OPSEC plan impact: ―The
        provisions of AFI 10-101, Operations Security Program (OPSEC), have been considered in the
        preparation of this plan.‖
        7. COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS. If other than normal, summarize the command arrangements to
        be employed in executing the plan. Usually, command relationships will be ―Normal.‖
        8. LOGISTICS APPRAISAL. Provide an estimate of logistic feasibility and considerations.
        9. PERSONNEL APPRAISAL. Provide an estimate of personnel feasibility and any additional
