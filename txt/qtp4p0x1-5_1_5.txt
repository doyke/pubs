                                        INTRODUCTION

1. This Qualification Training Package (QTP) was developed to enhance and standardize on-the-
job training for 4P0X1 personnel. As a trainer, the QTPs provide teachable elements of task
breakdowns. The teachable elements will assist in guiding the trainee towards independent task
performance, proficiency, and serve as an evaluation tool for task certifiers/certification
officials.

2. Review each volume(s) of the Career Development Course (CDC) and identify which
module(s) of the QTP are needed for the trainee’s job position or upgrade skill-level training.
The QTP training for each module should be accomplished in the order which most closely
mirrors the area the trainee is working in. Items in column 2 of the Pharmacy Career Field
Education and Training Plan (CFETP) marked with a 5 or 7 are the core tasks for the 4P career
field. Additional proficiency training may be required for these tasks at the supervisor’s
discretion.

3. Ensure the trainee reviews the training references in each module prior to attempting any task
or QTP evaluation. Review the performance checklist and training objective with the trainee. If
the trainee has questions about the objective, clarify the desired outcome/results of performance,
demonstration or completion for the task. Remember the objective of each QTP is to standardize
training and allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform
the task independently.

4. When the trainee has received sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on the objective,
follow the evaluation instructions. The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate
each task objective. When the trainee successfully demonstrates and accomplishes the objective,
document task completion appropriately in the member’s 6-part training/competency folder.

5. The QTP task completion is to be annotated on an AF Form 1098 Special Task Certification
and Recurring Training, filed in part 3, section A of the 6-part training/competency folder.
NOTE: The individual check lists and final evaluations are not filed in each member’s 6-part
training/competency folder. A master checklist is filed in part 3, section A of the master training
plan (MTP).

6. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas needing remediation.
Conduct feedback for each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in the member’s
6-part training/competency folder. As the trainer, once you are satisfied the trainee is ready to
perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective is met.

7. If a task being trained requires third party certification by a task certifier/certifying official,
the trainer ensures trainee is qualified to perform the task independently. The trainee will then
be evaluated by certifier/certifying official. Tasks requiring third party certification are
identified in column 2 of CFETP with a number sign (#). The third party certifier will ensure
documentation in column 3E of the CFETP and finally documented appropriately in the
members’ 6-part training/competency folder.

8. The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing task qualifications for upgrade training or job
position training. Such standardization benefits the CFETP training concept throughout a
member’s career. These documents also may be used in assessing/certifying pharmacy
technicians upon arrival at a new duty station.

9. Feedback is a vital and important part of improving our educational process for pharmacy
technicians. Your first hand expertise is valued and feedback highly encouraged ensuring we
have the most up-to-date information and training possible. Please direct all inquires to: your
immediate supervisor.

REMARKS/NOTES: Accreditation is a voluntary process but it is a congressional mandate for
all Air Force Medical Services. It allows our facilities to measure the quality of its services and
performance against nationally recognized standards. When seeking accreditation, a facility
must undergo an extensive on-site, peer-based survey of its facilities and services to include
inspection of Pharmacy Services. Therefore, a solid self-inspection program is vital to
compliance and accreditation. There are tools available to help assess and track your compliance
as well as prepare your Periodic Performance Review.

OBJECTIVE:

1. Demonstrate the performance aspects of compliance tracking through the use of self
inspection tools such as manual applications, MedFACTS and/or AMP.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1.   After the trainee has received instructions, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task.

                                       INTRODUCTION

1.1. Functional Description. The Medical Facility Assessment and Compliance Tracking
System (MedFACTS) is a self-assessment and compliance tracking tool that allows medical
treatment facilities (MTFs) throughout the Air Force to monitor effectively and sustain
compliance with Health Services Inspection (HSI) healthcare standards. Through this
application, inspection team members can share notes, research, and collected assessment
information with other one other. MedFACTS also provides the ability to gather relevant
information into compliance item assessments. A reviewed and approved compliance item
assessment functions as the final product of an Assessor’s research.

1.2. Readiness. From a readiness perspective, MedFACTS can ensure that Air Force
components are complying with healthcare guidelines.

1.3. Legacy. MedFACTS has been designed to replace the current Web-Odyssey prototype
application. The intention is to use information gained from the prototype to obtain a reliable set
of user requirements, thus assuring improved ease of use, performance, stability, and flexibility.

1.4. Objectives.

                                   MEDFACTS OBJECTIVES
Maximize the effectiveness of the environment in reach-back situations.
Minimize the performance overhead of the environment.
Provide an intuitive, user-friendly set of interfaces.
Provide mechanisms for Assessors to work together as teams on assessment tasks, giving all
team members access to retrieved information and assessments of other team members.
Promote synergy among previously accomplished assessment activities, as well as current

1.7. User Types. Within MedFACTS are several user types. Each has certain defined specific
roles (functions and privileges/permissions).

                                  MedFACTS User Types
  User Type                                     Basic Functions
Administrator   Create, lock, unlock, and inactivate user accounts; assign permissions; modify
                user profiles; create organizational hierarchy nodes and assign users to them;
                assign compliance items to hierarchical nodes. Perform the functions of any
                other user within the organizational level.
Assigner        Create organizational hierarchy nodes and assign compliance items to them,
                perform assessments and provide scoring, review and accept or reject
                assessments and their scores.
Assessor        Perform assessments of assigned compliance items (CIs) and can provide
                scoring, designate compliance of particular compliance items as ―Best
                Practice.‖
Reviewer        Review CIs, provide review comments; accept or reject assessments and their
                scores; nominate compliance of particular compliance items as ―Best
                Practice‖; and remove Assessors’ ―Best Practice‖ designations.
Overseer        Are granted read-only access—oversight—permissions. Overseer
                permissions will typically be extended to Air Staff and major command
                (MAJCOM) personnel for the purpose of review.
New User        Personnel who have applied for MedFACTS membership but whose accounts
                have not yet been activated. They have no capability to view any information
                within MedFACTS.

1.8. User Hierarchy. The figure below illustrates the relative hierarchy and commensurate
permissions and responsibilities of different user types. While Reviewers and Assigners are
essentially on the same level, they do have different permissions and responsibilities.

Figure 1.1. User Type Hierarchy.

1.9. Compliance Items and Assessments. Users are given specific compliance item
information to assist in their assessments. Users have associated work folders to be used to
organize their assessments. These work folders are associated with the CIs that are assigned to
specific folders or hierarchy nodes.

1.10. Operational Description. MedFACTS has the capability to support multiple locations,
some with their own servers and some communicating with a central or alternate server. Each
MedFACTS server should be capable of accessing multiple-configured data servers to support
the replication of data, as well as fail-over, standby capabilities. The goal is to provide access to
the nearest available data service, thereby reducing performance constraints due to location-
specific bandwidth limitations. These data servers may be distributed in such a manner as to
require the MedFACTS server to access these services both locally and remotely. MedFACTS
client servers must be capable of connecting to either local MedFACTS servers or remote
MedFACTS servers. To facilitate speedy and reliable response to remote systems, client servers
should be constructed in such a way as to minimize required network bandwidth to support
remote operations with limited bandwidth.

                                             Chapter 2

                                THE ASSIGNMENT PROCESS

2.1. Identify Functional or Work Areas to Be Assessed. For any given self-assessment, all or
some functional areas should be identified. It may be appropriate, for various reasons, to exclude
certain items from an inspection. Establishing a plan is essential.

2.2. Establish Organizational Hierarchy. It is necessary to establish an organizational
hierarchy. Since MTFs vary in structure, a mechanism exists to allow MTFs to structure
hierarchies accordingly and to organize their compliance item assessments on the basis of their
organizational structures. The hierarchy is displayed in a Microsoft Windows Explorer folder
tree structure, with which most users likely are familiar. Nodes may be built and organized
according to individual organizations’ departmental structures, technology subject areas, shifts,
or specific individuals.

2.3. Create Organizational Hierarchy Nodes. Organizational nodes are displayed as folders,
which can be named anything that is meaningful within an organization’s structure. Names,
however, must be unique among sibling folders. They may contain other folders and may also
have specific users and compliance items assigned. When users are assigned to folders, they
have access to all compliance items assigned to those folders, as well as all items subordinate to
those folders that may include other folders and their compliance items.

2.4. Select Standard Products. The role of the organization and its hierarchy and/or other
factors may influence which set of standards to use. The Assigner must select a set, which can
be from among the following available products from AFIA. Other products may be added with
later revisions of MedFACTS.

                             SELF-ASSESSMENT PRODUCTS
  Acronym                                  Product                                      Source

Figure 2.1. Self-Assessment Products.

2.5. Assign CIs and Set Assigned Dates. After the organizational hierarchy has been
established, the Assigner must then assign all CIs to be used in the self-assessment to specific
nodes and indicate the dates on which they were assigned. This will help establish and exercise
control over what is and what is not required for assessment for each node.

2.6. Create Custom CIs. There may be areas that need to be inspected for which no existing
self-assessment product exists, or there may be areas that should include additional inspection
criteria not covered elsewhere. The Assigner can create, when necessary, sets of custom
compliance items, which can then be used in the same manner as existing products.

2.7. Assign Individuals to Assess Assigned CIs. The Administrator must assign specific
individuals to specific CIs to establish a clear structure of who is responsible for what, thereby
reducing the possibility of omissions and duplications of effort.

2.8. Set Suspense Dates. When CIs have been assigned and individuals assigned to inspect
them, the Assigner must establish suspense dates—dates by which the assessments should be
completed. Automated E-mail notices will be generated as reminders when those dates have
passed and items are still open.

                               THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS

3.1. Study CIs and Their Requirements. The Assessor—the key player in this process—must
review and study the requirements for each CI, which can include some or all of the following:

                         COMPLIANCE ITEM COMPONENTS
     Item                                           Definition
Description      Outlines the compliance item.
Intent           Explains a standard’s rationale, meaning, and significance.
Scoring          Includes a question, or questions, to help Assessors focus on the performance
                 expectation of a standard or compliance item and identifies the levels of
                 compliance expressed in frequency of compliance or quantitative or
                 qualitative terms.
Table 3.1. Compliance Item Components.

3.2. Assess Compliance Items. On the basis of CI expectations, examples, and scoring criteria,
the Assessor must then perform the assessment.

3.3. Update Assessment Information. As assessment findings are determined, the Assessor
must update those findings in MedFACTS and render evaluation scores according to the
established CI components.

                          COMPLIANCE ITEM ASSESSMENT
       Item                                          Description
Assessment            Update remarks that detail how compliance to an associated CI is
                      achieved.
Interview             Update the interview process and its results that support or relate to the
                      assessment.
Inspection Findings   Update remarks that detail the findings of an actual inspection.
(Lessons Learned)     Typically, these findings will be post-inspection comments.
Corrective Action     Update remarks detailing the plan of action for correcting any
Plan                  deficiencies in compliance.
Supporting            Add pointers to information gathered by users (typically, Assessor or
Documentation         Reviewer) supporting the assessment and/or review. These links will
Links                 point to supporting information, which may be in the form of Microsoft
                      Word documents, HTML links, Zip (compressed) files, or other types
                      of information imported into the system.
Assessment Review     Update remarks detailing acceptance or rejection of an assessment and
                      its score.
Assessment Scores     Determine assessed scores and estimated closeout dates for correction
                      of deficiencies.

3.4. Set Assessment Scores. On the basis of the inspection results, the Assessor must give each
CI a score. Scores generally include values that equate to good compliance, acceptable
compliance, and non-compliance. There may be varying degrees of non-compliance; for
example, least deficient, more deficient, and most deficient.

3.5. Nominate and Un-Nominate CI Assessments as Best Practices. The Assessor may also
indicate particular practices as being especially good and that should be modeled by others.
Conversely, the Assessor may remove from nomination such practices that other users have
previously nominated.

3.6. Set Estimated Closed Dates. On the basis of inspection results and scores given, the
Assessor must determine dates by which deficiencies must be corrected. If actions have not been
completed by those dates, automated E-mails will be generated as reminders.

                                THE REVIEW PROCESS

4.1. Evaluate Comments and Scores. The Reviewer should read all information for each CI
that has been updated in MedFACTS and determine whether to accept, reject, or submit the
assessment for review.

4.2. Make Appropriate Changes. A Reviewer who disagrees with the assessment and score of
the Assessor may make changes, including changing scores, revising or adding comments, and
changing status (Accepted, Rejected, Need Review).

                             REPORTS AND BULLETIN BOARD

5.1. Importance of Reports. From time to time, users—especially higher management—will
require reports that provide statistics for the results of assessments. Use of reports may vary
considerably, but the capability exists for users to select certain information selection criteria
before running reports, thereby eliminating unneeded information.

5.2. Types of Reports. Two types of reports can be generated: Overview Report and Detailed
Report—the former being a summary and the latter having much greater specificity on
information retrieved.

5.3. The Bulletin Board System (BBS). Administrators may, from time to time, post electronic
messages so that all MedFACTS users within that organizational hierarchy can read them. They
can also delete and modify existing messages.

                           SECURITY AND ADMINISTRATION

6.1. Password Security. Security requirements are stringent drastically to lower the possibility
of compromise. In addition, only the users themselves know their own passwords; they are not
maintained anywhere in MedFACTS that is visible even to administrators.

6.2. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). MedFACTS uses SSL, which is evidenced by https instead
of http at the beginning of the web address.

6.3. Permissions. Users cannot log in to MedFACTS until their accounts have been activated.
A requirement is that permissions have to be assigned before an account is activated. Only
administrators can perform these functions.

6.4. Account Status. Administrators can lock and unlock accounts as needed. If a user tries too
many times to log in unsuccessfully, the account will be locked, and only an administrator can
unlock it. If user no longer require access to MedFACTS or if there is a valid reason to prevent
their doing so, administrators may unlock account, either temporarily or permanently.

Q. What is MedFACTS?

A. The Medical Facility Assessment and Compliance Tracking System (MedFACTS) is a self-
assessment and compliance tracking tool that allows medical treatment facilities (MTFs)
throughout the Air Force to monitor effectively and sustain compliance with Health Services
Inspection (HSI) healthcare standards. Through this application, inspection team members can
share notes, research, and collect assessment information with one another. MedFACTS also
provides the ability to gather relevant information into compliance item assessments. A
reviewed and approved compliance item assessment functions as the final product of an
Assessor’s research.

Q. Who is involved in the MedFACTS process?

A. MedFACTS participants, with varying degrees of responsibility and permissions, exist within
the following organizations:

   Headquarters Air Force Surgeon General (HQ USAF/SG)
   Major Command (MAJCOM) SG Activities
   Base-Level Medical Treatment Facilities
   Other organizations with which the Air Force Medical Service has ties

Q. What do I need in the way of hardware and software to access and use MedFACTS?

A. In order to access MedFACTS successfully, your workstation must be configured with the
following minimum hardware and software requirements:

   Windows NT, Windows 2000, or later
   Hardware capable of running the software listed below
   Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.5 or later or Netscape 6.0 or later
   Secure sockets layer (SSL)
   Browser capability of 128-bit encryption
   Current Java 2 Runtime Environment (J2RE) 1.4.2. or higher is required
   800 x 600 screen resolution (1024 x 768 recommended)

Q. What browsers can I use with MedFACTS?

A. Currently, you can use Internet Explorer (IE) version 5.5 or later and Netscape 6.0 or later.
Older versions will not support MedFACTS.

Q. My browser is set to 800 x 600, as is specified in the User’s Guide, but some of the
information is off the screen and I have to scroll up and down and back and forth to see it
all. Can I do something about this?

A. Both screen resolution and screen size will affect how the application is displayed. If you are
having this problem, you might try changing your settings to 1024 x 768. In case you aren’t
familiar with how to do this, just follow these steps:

   Minimize everything and right-click on the ―wallpaper.‖
   Click Properties on the drop-down menu.
   Click the Settings tab on the Display Properties window that is displayed.
   Move the slide bar under Screen Area to the right until you get the 1024 x 768 resolution.
   Click OK.
   Click OK in the Display Properties dialogue box.
   When the screen has been refreshed, click Yes in the Monitor Settings dialogue box.

Q. My browser has only 56-bit encryption, and I can’t get to any applications that have
“https” in the URL. Can I upgrade to 128-bit encryptions, and if so, how?

A. Yes, you can upgrade to 128-bit. The procedures for Internet Explorer and Netscape are
different, so review the section below that applies to you.

                 Verifying 128-Bit Encryption Capability (Internet Explorer)

Verifying 128-Bit Encryption Capability (Netscape). If you experience encryption problems
or are unable to connect to the MedFACTS server, complete the steps below.

Launch Netscape.

Click on Help (top menu bar).

Click on About Netscape.

Determine if the version number at the top of the page is Version 6.0 or higher. If not, you will
not be able to use Netscape with MedFACTS.

If your version is compatible, look for the paragraph toward the bottom of the first section in
bold letters.

       If it says, ―This version supports high grade (128-bit) security . . . ,‖ you have 128-bit
        encryption.
       If it says, ―This browser supports international security . . . ,‖ you have 56-bit
        encryption.

Remember that only Version 6.0 or above will work with MedFACTS. If you have an older
version and still prefer to use Netscape, you will have to obtain an upgrade. Go to the Air Force
Medical Service Downloads web page, https://www.afms.mil/product_download/index.cfm, to

see if what you need is available. If so, go ahead and download it. If the version you need is not
yet available at that web page, check with your LAN activity to see about getting it installed.

                     Verifying 128-Bit Encryption Capability (Netscape)

Verifying 128-Bit Encryption Capability (Internet Explorer). If you experience encryption
problems or are unable to connect to the MedFACTS server, complete the steps below.

Launch Internet Explorer.

Click on Help (top menu bar).

Click on About Internet Explorer.

Determine if the version number is Version 5.5 or higher. If not, you will need to upgrade. The
display should include information on the Version, Cipher Strength, Product ID, and Update
Versions.

If the Cipher Strength is 128-bit, you should have no problem. If it is 56-bit, you must upgrade
to 128-bit encryption. Make a note of the Version (for example, 6.0) and Update Versions (for
example, Q323759) information. Click OK.

To upgrade Internet Explorer versions, first clear it with your LAN activity and determine
exactly what software or software package you should download. Then follow these steps:

   Check with your LAN activity to determine the proper download package and obtain
    permission to download the software.
   Browse to http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx? (? is part of the URL.). This
    is the Microsoft Download Center.
   Click the product name (for example, Internet Explorer 6.0 and Internet Tools). Make
    sure that English is displayed in the Change Language drop-down menu; if not, select
    English.
   Click Download.
   Follow the on-screen downloading instructions.

Q. Is there some kind of general purpose checklist I can use to do some preliminary
trouble shooting if something doesn’t work properly?

A. The guidelines below may be of some use to you. Some of the topics have been covered in
other FAQs, but this can give you a quick reference.

1. Ensure that your video display is set to at least 800 x 600 resolution.

2. Check for the correct syntax in URL: https://medfacts.afms.mil/MedFACTS. NOTE: the s after
http is VERY important; the server will NOT acknowledge you without it.

3. Ensure that you are using Netscape version 6.0 or higher or Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher
and that it is capable of 128-bit encryption. See the question that addresses Verifying 128-Bit
Encryption Capability for instructions.

4. If you have difficulties in connecting to the server, try to connect on at least three separate
occasions at least 20 minutes apart. Heavy Internet traffic anywhere between your desktop and
the MedFACTS server could prevent successful connection.

5. If you receive an error message, please copy and save the message text, as this is the primary
tool to troubleshoot and resolve problems.

6. Make note of anything you may have changed on your computer, particularly browser
settings, since your last successful connection to MedFACTS.

7. Send an E-mail to the MedFACTS Service Center at service.center@brooks.af.mil and be
specific about what you are trying to accomplish and what kind of problem you are having.
Please include the text of all error messages you receive and any changes made to your computer
or browser since your last successful connection.

Q. How can I gain access to MedFACTS?

A. Please consult with your Administrator first. If your Administrator has not pre-registered
you and your Administrator has indicated that you are able to register into MedFACTS, point
your browser to this web site: https://medfacts.afms.milMedFACTS. When the MedFACTS log-in
screen is displayed, click the New button at the bottom of the screen, and the New User Request
dialog box will be displayed. You must complete the information blocks that it contains.

In the right pane, all of the blocks are free-flow text boxes except for Access Point. You select
your own User ID and Password at this time. Block titles that have asterisks (*) to the right of
the block names (for example, Last Name) require input; others are optional. Complete the
remainder of the information up to Access Point. Remember your User ID and your Password.

To select Access Point, use the menu in the left pane, expanding each echelon’s directory until
you find your organization, and click it.

When you have finished, click OK.

Note: If you do not see your Access Point displayed, DO NOT register utilizing another
Access Point. “Cancel” out of the Profile Screen and consult your Administrator.

You will receive an E-mail indicating that your request has been received and will be processed.
Access Request Confirmation notice, stating that your request and information have been
received.

Within a short period of time, you should receive an automated E-mail the user administrator at
that organization indicating that your account has been activated.

Q. Okay, now I have received notification that my application has been approved. What
do I do next?

A. Return to the MedFACTS web site: https://medfacts.afms.mil/MedFACTS. Before you can log
in, the Computer Security Agreement screen will be displayed. It specifies the legal
ramifications involved with the unauthorized use of MedFACTS applications and the sensitivity
of Department of Defense (DoD) information. You must accept the computer security terms that
DoD requires; to do so, click the OK button.

The Log-In screen will then be displayed. Type your User ID and Password in the appropriate
blocks and click the OK button. It may take a short time for MedFACTS to validate your user
information, and then you will be logged in.

Q. Once I get logged in, how can I find out more about MedFACTS and how it works?

A. There is a guide or handbook available to all users. At the splash page, on the right is a menu
bar. Click User Documentation for the User’s Guide or Installation Instructions if you need
to install MedFACTS.

Q. I understand that I have to change my password periodically? Suppose I go TDY or
am deployed while I am supposed to do this, return from TDY, and cannot access
MedFACTS?

A. You must change your password every 90 days. After you have passed the 90th day, when
you attempt to log in, you will be prompted to make that change. Type in your old password,
followed by a new one, twice for verification. Do not select a password that you have used
during the previous 180 days. It will be rejected, and the application will prompt you to make
another selection. When you are finished, click OK.

If you are unsuccessful in changing your password, you will receive a notice telling you why.
Make sure that your choice meets the requirements as specified in the User Security
Requirements table, type it in twice for verification, and click OK.

If you make three unsuccessful attempts to log in, your account will become locked. An E-mail
notice will be sent automatically to your user administrator(s), who will be able to unlock your
account.

After you have changed a password, you cannot change it again for at least 10 days. If you
attempt to do so, you will be notified how old your current password is. If it becomes necessary
to change your password within that time—for example, if you suspect a compromise—notify
your MedFACTS user administrator, who can change it for you.

If you have not logged in to your MedFACTS account for 180 days, it will be inactivated
automatically, and you should receive an E-mail message informing you. You will have to get in
touch with your MedFACTS user administrator to reactivate it.

Q. If I forget my password, what should I do?

A. Go to the log-in screen, and type in your User ID. Then click the icon to the right of the
Password block.

First, you will see a notice indicating that your password will be E-mailed. After a short time,
check your incoming E-mail. You should receive an application-generated message containing
your password.

You will then be able to log in; however, at that time, you will once again be required to change
your password, as you did when you initially activated your account.

Q. I don’t remember the last time I changed my password, but I don’t want it to expire on
me. Can I change my password even though I have not been notified to do so?

A. Click Edit on the Menu Bar and then click Profile. The ―Edit Profile‖ screen will be
displayed. Click on the ―Change‖ button in the ―Password‖ section, and the ―New Password”
screen will be displayed. You must type in your current password and a new one twice for
verification.

Q. If I try to log in several times unsuccessfully, will my account become inaccessible at
some point?

A. If you try unsuccessfully to log in three times within one hour, your account will become
locked, and you will be unable to use it. An automated E-mail notice will be sent to individuals
who have been assigned user administrator responsibilities. They will be able to unlock your
account. However, if you know these administrators, you can always talk with them or E-mail
them to ask for help.

Q. What if something in MedFACTS doesn’t seem to work properly?

A. Your ―first line of defense‖ for MedFACTS questions and problems is your MedFACTS
Administrator. If your Administrator is unable to help, the Administrator should initiate a
trouble ticket.

If you are an administrator, click Tools, E-Mail, and E-Mail Help Desk on the Menu Bar. A
pre-formatted E-mail to the Service Center will be generated. Be sure to describe the problem or
question in detail.

Q. When I want to exit MedFACTS, do I just close the browser or do I need to I log out?

A. Logging out is always preferable. To do so, click File and Exit on the Menu Bar. After you
have logged out, you will be returned to the Introduction screen.

Q. When I use the browser back button to return to a previous screen, sometimes I end up
at some other screen? Is there any way to avoid this?

A. Yes, there is. Browser back buttons often do this, so the best thing is to hold the mouse
pointer over the screen in an area that does not contain any information and right-click the
mouse. On the pop-up menu, click Back, and you will be returned to the previous screen. This
is more preferable than using the browser back button.

Q. Now and then the screen looks distorted or has extraneous characters or partial
graphics displayed. How can I can get rid of those and clean up the screen?

A. Yes, you can. Most likely you need to refresh the screen. We recommend that you do not
use the browser refresh or reload buttons. Instead, hold the mouse pointer over the screen in an
area that does not contain any information and right-click the mouse. On the pop-up menu, click
Refresh (Internet Explorer) or Reload (Netscape). That should clean up your screen.

Q. I know that I have to put dates in a certain format, and that I can do this by using the
calendar icon. How does this work?

A. All dates must be entered by using the Calendar. Click in a field requiring a date, and a
notice indicating that you can select the current date or a different date. For the current date,
click OK. For a different date, click the down arrow by the date block, and the Calendar icon
will then be displayed. Select the appropriate year and month from the Calendar and click the
day to populate the block.

To go to a future month or to a past month, click the left or right arrow, respectively.

Q. Some data selections use radio buttons, and some use check boxes. Both seem to do the
same thing. Is there a difference between the two?

A. There is a difference, as indicated below:

Radio Buttons. These buttons are designed to select and deselect various options and will
always be displayed in groups of two or more. Generally, click the one you want, and a dot will
appear within it. To deselect an option, click another button, and any previously selected one
will be deselected, or click the same button again and the dot will be removed. Some functions
will allow you to select two or more, depending on the purpose of the specific function.

Check Boxes. These boxes allow you to select one or more items and to deselect items. To
select a Check Box, click in it, and a checkmark will appear. To deselect a Check Box, click it
again, and the check mark will be removed.

Q. Why am I unable to download any of the documents, such as the User’s Guide?

A. The problem may be that your base is blocking downloads of RTF, (Rich Text Format) and
DOC files from across the Web. You should check with your local communications squadron or
get in touch with us directly for trouble-shooting. If it is a base communications problem, we
cannot resolve it.

Q. Will the user be able to attach documents to an assessment?

A. Yes, but not in the sense of ―attachments,‖ as in the case of attaching a file to an E-mail. The
user will be able to attach documents utilizing the Assessment panel’s ―Supporting
Documentation Links‖ tab. However, if documents are to be shared, the user must insure that
those documents reside on a network shared drive that is accessible to all users.

These links will point to supporting information, which may be in the form of Microsoft Word
documents, HTML, (hyper text markup language) links, Zip (compressed) files, or other types of
information imported into the system.

Q. Can two individuals access the same compliance item?

A. Yes. Two or more individuals can access the same compliance item, provided they are
assigned to the same node (folder) that contains the compliance item. Remember, that an
Administrator, Assigner, Assessor, or Reviewer can view and ―work‖ compliance items that are
in their respective Access Point nodes and any subordinate nodes under their Access Point.

However, it is a best practice that no two individuals work on the same compliance item at the
same time. Since the application runs in real time then all information can be overwritten by one
or the other individual working on the compliance item.

Q. Will Odyssey data be migrated into MedFACTS?

A. The Odyssey users are encouraged to ―cut and paste‖ their existing Odyssey data into
MedFACTS. It is highly recommended that the data be reviewed and, if necessary, corrected,
prior to being pasted into the MedFACTS application.

Q. Who will be the individuals who can assign multiple compliance items?

A. The users designated as ―Assigner‖ are the individuals who can assign multiple compliance
items. If an Assigner needs to assign the same compliance item(s) to multiple nodes, then the
Assigner may want to consider creating a template that contains those compliance items and then
assigning that ―template/folder‖ to each of the designated nodes.

Note: the “Template” feature is not currently active in the MedFACTS application. It is

Q. Who can initiate or nominate a “Best Practice”?

A. Administrators, Assigners, Assessors, or Reviewers can promote an item for ―Best Practice.‖

Q. Who is responsible for establishing the hierarchy for the MedFACTS users?

Administrators, whose primary responsibility is to create initial organizational hierarchal nodes,
and Assigners, who can create organizational hierarchy nodes (folders) within the Assigner’s
POE node and any subordinate nodes.

Help Desk.

Q. How will a user know that a score is the most resent score?

A. The most recent (current) score is displayed in the Assessment tab’s Self Assessment Score
field in the Assessment panel of the Assessment tab.

Q. How long can a user account remain dormant?

A. If a user’s account is inactive for 180 days or more, then the account becomes inactive. The
user will have to contact the MedFACTS Administrator so that the Administrator may unlock the
account. After the account has been unlocked, the user may want to access the account and
update his user profile, in case any information has changed with in the last 180 days.

Q. How will an Administrator, an Assigner, or a Reviewer know that a person is working a
particular compliance item?

A. A user designated as Administrator can always access the Assignment tab in order to identify
which users have been assigned to a node. The only way that a user will know that another user
is working on a compliance item is to review the comments in the various Assessment tabs.

Q. How does MedFACTS save data once it has been entered into a text field?

A. If a user clicks on another tab after he has finished entering text into a text filed, the
application will save any text that was entered. Also, if the user is keying in text information
into a text field and, for any reason, the user moves the cursor to any other area out of the text
field input area, the application will automatically save the information that was entered.

Q: When we have Compliance Standards crossing functional lines—multiple groups or
squadrons, such as mobility deployments (AMDG/readiness squadron, public health flight,
medical record PHAs (MDOG), war reserve material (MDSG/logistics squadron)—can
more than one person input and score the same standard, and who would be the required
reviewer?

A: Various individuals—provided the Administrator has assigned them to the same node
(folder)—can provide input to an assessment. Each person can time stamp his comments in
various sections of the Assessment panel. However, there can be only one score.

Each facility will establish its own review flow process and identify who will be part of that
review process. We recommend that the reviewers be personnel in the compliance management
chain-of-command. These individuals should be personnel who are responsible for the
management of the compliance item that are assigned.

ATTACHMENT THREE:

        Accreditation Manager Plus: An Interactive Toolkit for
                      Continuous Compliance
Accreditation Manager Plus (AMP™) is an electronic tool that can help your organization maintain continuous
compliance, prepare for its Periodic Performance Review (PPR), and facilitate communication and understanding of
Joint Commission standards requirements across your organization. And, for 2007, we are offering some new
features and formats to make using AMP even more convenient! All versions of AMP include the following:

        An automated version of the Comprehensive Accreditation Manual for your purchased setting
        A tool that allows your organization to prepare and submit its PPR
        Ongoing assessment of compliance with Joint Commission standards and elements of performance (EPs)
        Detailed examples of compliance at the EP level
        Project management capabilities allowing you to assign and view tasks, develop and track plans of action
         and measures of success, and view and print status reports.

Choose AMP in the version that is right for you
PC–based version. Installs on one designated individual PC. Select the PC version if you have a small number of
associates and possibly only one user requiring access to AMP. Still have multiple people using AMP but in a non-
networked environment? Simply install AMP on one workstation and utilize the same project management features
AMP offers by sharing AMP on that one workstation.
Network version. If you currently have an AMP site license, then you have the Network version. This version is
installed on individual work stations, but allows multiple users to access a single data base to view and share data.
This version works best if you have multiple users located within the same site and you do not have or do not want to
use your own intranet. It is available only as a site license, which provides unlimited access within an organization.
(Note: A separate site license is required for each individual organization per your JCAHO organization ID # and one
site license is required for each instance of the database)
Web-Based AMP. You asked for it! Announcing our new Web-Based AMP in two versions--Intranet and Extranet.
Both new Web-Based versions of AMP provides you with additional benefits:

        24x7 access to AMP from any location via the internet
        Enhanced security features
        Application installed on server vs. individual PCs
        New and expanded administrative functionality
        Additional sorting and viewing capabilities in project management

Intranet: This web-based version allows you to put AMP on your intranet site and share access and data among
multiple users via your intranet site. This version is installed on a web server, allowing access from any work station
via a secure password, allowing easy access from both on-site and off-site locations.It is offered as a site license
only, providing unlimited access within and organization. Current site license customers can easily upgrade to this
version using our migration tool. (Note: A separate site license is required for each organization per your JCAHO
organization ID # and each site created within AMP web-based version).
Extranet: If you want the features and capabilities of the Web-Based AMP, but don’t want to manage it on your
server , you can access Web-Based AMP via an off-site secure server managed and supported by JCR. Just let us
know what works best for you. (Note: A separate site license is required for each organization per your JCAHO
organization ID # and each site created within web-based AMP version).
Do you already have AMP? Are you wondering if you can switch your Network version to the Web-based? You sure
can! Simply renew your existing AMP product and migrate from Network to Web-based for an additional $200 per site
license!
