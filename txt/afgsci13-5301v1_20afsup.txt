1.3.2. All guidance and clarification requests must be submitted in signed memorandum format
and requested by senior crews or higher authority.
2.5.1.6.4. Content of the weapon system certification must include AFI 91-114, paragraphs 4, 6,
11, 15, 16, 17; however, additional unit specific topics of interest, issues, deficiencies, technical
orders and security references may be discussed at the commander’s discretion.
3.2.5. (Added) Before conducting MPT training, instructors must:
3.2.5.1. (Added) Prepare and review the selected script and associated materials.
3.2.5.2. (Added) Review individual training records for potential weaknesses or problem areas,
or supplemental training that may be required and administer any required supplemental training
prior to the training session.
3.2.5.3. (Added) Ensure all necessary training documentation is present.
3.2.5.4. (Added) Properly configure the MPT IAW the script and instructor setup guide, as
applicable.
3.3.1.1. (Added) Before conducting classroom training, instructors must:
3.3.1.1.1. (Added) Review all required training materials/training aides.
3.3.1.1.2. (Added) Gather all required ancillary material needed to conduct the classroom
training.
3.3.1.1.3. (Added) Prepare the classroom environment to minimize distractions and facilitate
open discussion.
3.3.1.2. (Added) After the classroom training session is complete, instructors must document
all test scores, and recommend additional training (if necessary). TEAMS will be used to record
knowledge test scores when available.
4.3.5.6. (Added) During MQT, DMCCCs should receive a maintenance AFSC/tasks/vehicle
familiarization brief and a MMOC/MSC tour.
4.5.3.1.2. (Added) An emphasis should be placed on status monitoring, checklist discipline
and common errors/problems experienced by new MCCCs.
4.5.4. (Added) The following requirements may be met either as a senior deputy prior to the
upgrade, or alternately, at the next available occasion following the upgrade. The OG/CC or
designated representative may waive the requirement until an individual is able to attend.
Failure to meet these requirements does not require restriction, decertification, or preventing the
upgrade from taking place.
4.5.4.1. (Added) Individuals will attend one Team Chief/SNCO briefing/open discussion.
Topics should include but are not limited to the following: plans and scheduling,
operations/maintenance procedures and issues that affect operations in the field. After
briefing/open discussion crews will observe maintenance being performed at an LF (or the LF
trainer).

5.2.4. Present monthly training to CMR personnel during each calendar month. See paragraphs
2.5.4.1.3.1. and 5.2.4.3. for exceptions.
5.2.5.1. Units will schedule crews integrally for all T1/T3/T4 and MPT training events when
operationally feasible.
6.3. Training scripts will be technically accurate in accordance with technical orders and
applicable directives.
6.3.4.1. (Added) Scripts will measure performance in weapon system operation in a peacetime
environment and the majority of EWO performances in a wartime environment. The early
portion of the ride will consist primarily of weapon system events and may contain some EWO
preparation messages. This segment will transition into a wartime environment where the
primary focus is EWO. Expected weapon system effects (e.g., power and communications
losses, blast valves closing, etc.) should occur in this portion of the ride. The ride must have
opportunities for crews to demonstrate proper prioritization (e.g. restoring cooling air prior to
addressing an LF fault). Clock advances will be used to clean up extraneous status.
6.3.9. (Added) On-line scripts must utilize a system to track changes made throughout the
script’s effective time. Units will include a List of Effective pages tracking all changes to the
script after publication date.
6.3.10. (Added) Units will number and date scripts to facilitate control and use.
6.4.5.1. Training events that violate TEPS and/or when unrelated status is presented during a
Level A task, label the event as CET and provide a brief description of the purpose (i.e. what
training value does this event provide).
6.5.1.1. (Added) Introducing Fire Status. Fire status will be presented using a status card in
accordance with paragraph 6.5.2.1. or a brief. When one piece of equipment is on fire, the status
card/brief will state, “You note smoke/heat coming from the indicated piece of equipment,
personal safety is not in jeopardy.” The instructor must outline the affected area twice and
ensure the MCC is in position to observe the act. The level A TEPS begins upon completion of
outlining the affected area the second time. In the event the MCC does not respond to the fire
indications, or takes incorrect isolation actions, do not present additional status. Original
indications will remain present and unchanged. If the MCCM is about to interact with the
affected piece of equipment and is not wearing gloves, brief “You sense heat.” If smoke or heat
is coming from several pieces of equipment (e.g. smoke coming from the base of all four shock
isolators) the card/brief will state “You note smoke/heat coming from the base of all four shock
isolators, personal safety is not in jeopardy.” At no time should the status card or brief identify
by name a single piece of equipment (e.g. you note smoke/heat coming from the motor generator
or NECS).
6.5.1.2. (Added) NUDET Ground Burst/Near Miss Weapon System Indications.
6.5.1.2.1. (Added) LCC Status. Dial lines, SACCS, VHF, UHF MILSTAR, SCC and EWO 1
will be down. HVC and EWO 2 will remain up as long as there is interconnectivity within the
squadron or squadrons; however, both HVC and EWO 2 may be presented as
impaired/inoperative within the constraints listed in AFGSCI 13-5301v4. UHF radio may be
presented up or down based on scenario requirements. EHF MILSTAR and VLF will be
operational. There should be a loss of commercial power with all associated indications. The

LCC may transition to diesel operation or remain on batteries depending on the scenario. [1]
The LCC will experience an LOPP and the diesel will not start.< [3, 5] LCEB blast valves should
close then reopen after the overpressure is no longer detected (approximately 20 minutes).<
MIIDS will either be in access or alarmed, depending on whether topside personnel were
evacuated to the tunnel junction/LCEB. The WSP will experience a Nuclear Event Detected
CIRCUMVENTION RESTART. Status indications on the WSCE VDU for destroyed LCCs
should include SLT VC # (where # is the timeslot of the destroyed LCC), LCC DOWN
indications, and no contact via HVC to isolated LCCs. These are scenario dependent. For
SACCS present Comm 1 and 2 lights on the SFU, line down indications, and KIV-7M ON LINE
LED blinking, FDX displayed, Channel 1 displayed IAW T.O. 21M-LGM30F-1-23, Figure 1-2.
6.5.1.2.2. (Added) LF Status. LF indications are dependent on missile launch and status
monitoring capability, seismic indication, and EMP status. Indications for an LF that has
launched are: CES, MSLA, DCBSY, LFNG, IPDDS, OZ/IZ, POWFL, LFALM, and GMR 2, 5,
10, 26, 27, 28, and 29. For an LF that has not launched indications are (as appropriate for
previous sortie status): EN, SALRT, PGLV, IPDDS, OZ/IZ, POWFL, LFALM, GMR 2, 5, 26,
27, 28, and 29, and MOSR 42 will set and clear. The decision to have the sortie come up on the
diesel and report GMR 3 depends upon the scenario being simulated (support building destroyed
or not). If the LF diesel is simulated to be non-operational, present GMR 5 indications. LFs
may also be presented as LFDN. Destroyed LFs should be shown as LFDN.
6.5.1.3. (Added) Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP)/High Altitude Burst (HAB) Weapon System
Indications.
6.5.1.3.1. (Added) LCC Status. Dial lines, SACCS, VHF, UHF MILSTAR, SCC and EWO 1
will be down. HVC and EWO 2 will remain operational. UHF radio may be presented up or
down based on scenario requirements. EHF MILSTAR and VLF will be operational. The LCC
should experience a loss of primary power and may remain on batteries or transition to the diesel
depending on the scenario. [1] The LCC will experience an LOPP and the diesel will not start.<
MIIDS either will be in access or alarmed, depending on whether topside personnel were
evacuated to the tunnel junction/LCEB. The WSP and MMP radios will experience a Nuclear
Event Detected CIRCUMVENTION RESTART. For SACCS present Comm 1 and 2 lights on
the SFU, line down indications, and KIV-7M ON LINE LED blinking, FDX displayed, Channel
1 displayed, [PLCC] IAW TO 21M-LGM30F-1-23, Figure 1-2< [SCP] IAW script
presentation.<
6.5.1.3.2. (Added) LF Status. LF indications are dependent on missile launch and status
monitoring capability, seismic indication, and EMP status. Indications for an LF that has
launched are: CES, MSLA, DCBSY, LFNG, IPDDS, OZ/IZ, POWFL, LFALM, and GMR 2, 5,
10, 26, 27, 28, and 29. Indications for an LF that has not launched are: SALRT, MOSR 42 will
set and clear, POWFL, LFALM, and GMR 2, 5, 26, 27, 28, and 29. LFs may also be presented
as LFDN. The decision to have the sortie transition to diesel and report GMR 3 depends upon
the scenario that is being simulated (LF diesel operational or not). If the LF diesel is simulated
to be non-operational, present GMR 5 indications.
6.5.2.1. (Added) When introducing information via status card, clearly state, “I have a status
card for the crew”, read the card out loud and place the card face up on the console between the
MCCC and DMCCC. If a level A TEPS applies, start the time upon completion of reading the
status card.
AFGSCI13-5301V1_20AFSUP 3 JULY 2013                                                               5


6.5.3. (Added) IPD Modem. Units will use W10 to program the IPD Modem not present for
PLCC crews. SCP crews will have an IPD Modem present.
6.5.4. (Added) Squadron Configuration Actions. Do not present any squadron configuration
actions until the MCC has initiated on their own configuration actions unless it is necessary for
proper presentation of a scenario (i.e. Pre-Launch Sequence prior to a PLC-B Stack). It is
permissible to program multiple PLCAs and/or PLSQ in the same block. If an MCC
immediately key turns after accomplishing configuration actions and the MPT does not provide
proper indications, brief proper indications and present the appropriate blocks to provide positive
launch indications. Any configuration blocks not presented prior to key turn do not need to be
presented after key turn unless they are necessary to provide proper launch indications.
6.6.1.1. (Added) SACCS Status. Initial in-briefs for MPT evaluations must include the fact
that the MPT is configured as a HUTE, even for SCP crews due to MPT configuration. All crews
will receive indications in accordance with the actual SACCS configuration for the scripted LCC
location regardless of whether they are an SCP or PLCC crew.
6.6.3.1. (Added) If a script allows the SCP crew to direct configuration actions, allow the crew
to direct all actions and continue if actions were consistent with the script.
6.6.3.1.1. (Added) If directed actions are correct but inconsistent with the script, direct the
crew to accomplish specific actions (e.g. “For training purposes, please accomplish the PLC-B,
Echo will accomplish the enable”). This method is acceptable to ensure required JPRs are
presented but overriding a crew’s correct but un-scripted directed actions should be otherwise
minimized.
6.6.3.1.2. (Added) If directed actions are incorrect (e.g. fails to direct a PLC-B stack, etc.) that
would cause sorties not to launch, correct crew’s mistake and brief correct configuration actions.
Document mistakes on the MPT training report.
6.7.2. (Added) Once the MPT session is complete, instructors must:
6.7.2.1. (Added) Ensure the MPT is returned to its baseline configuration to include resetting
switches and cleaning documents.
6.7.2.2. (Added) Review the script and crew responses, noting any problem areas.
6.7.2.3. (Added) Forward script discrepancies to the script OPR.
6.7.2.4. (Added) Document and report any MPT malfunctions to the CLS contractor.
7.1.1.1. (Added) Senior Crew instructors will develop and execute the instructor training
program and at a minimum will include items listed in paragraph 7.2.1. This training must be
documented and will include names, dates and topics instructed.
7.3.2. See Table A9.1, Instructor Certification Requirements Matrix for specific certification
requirements.
7.5. OG/CC appoints Senior Crew instructors and notifies 20 AF/A3 via memorandum as soon
as possible.
7.5.4. Once waiver is approved, a replacement Senior Crew member will be appointed and 20
AF/A3 will be notified.
