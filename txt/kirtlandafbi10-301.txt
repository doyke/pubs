This instruction implements AFMCI 10-301, Public Access Defibrillation Program. This instruction
establishes Kirtland Air Force Base's Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) program and implements
public law. The program provides for Automated External Defibrillators (AED) to be placed in strategic
locations on the installation to allow access by trained individuals for use in reviving personnel during
certain cardiac crises prior to arrival of Emergency Medical Services (EMS). It identifies responsibilities,
maintenance, quality assurance, and documentation requirements. Send comments and suggestions about
this publication for improvements on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR). Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN33-363, Management of
Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located
at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The previous version of this instruction made inferences that unit PAD POCs would be required to be
BLS/CPR instructors (paragraph 4.3.). This has been changed to allow any member of the PAD/AED·
owning unit to serve as the unit BLS/CPR instructor upon proper certification. Additionally, the roles
and responsibilities have been clarified in paragraph 3.
1. Purpose:
   1.1. Guidance. This Kirtland AFB Instruction (KAFBI) provides guidance for the deployment of
   Automated External Defibrillators (AED) within buildings at Kirtland APB and at any other location
   without a local AED directive. Public access defibrillators are to be used for emergency response.
   This KAFBI implements the guidance as specified in AFMCI 10-301, Public Access Defibrillation
   Program and further identifies and delineates the lines of responsibility and provides general
   guidelines to ensure an appropriate response to initiate such a program.

2. Scope:
    2.1. Roles and Responsibilities Description. This document describes the roles and responsibilities
    deemed necessary to ensure the broadest training and application of the AED. The scope of training
    and use is applicable to all federal employees and active duty personnel on Kirtland AFR.
3. Roles and Responsibilities:
    3.1. Installation Commander (377 ABW/CC): Appoints, in writing, the Installation PAD
    Coordinator (primary and alternate) IAW AFMCI 10·301, Public Access Defibrillation Program.
    3.2. Medical Group Commander: Appoints, in writing, the Installation PAD Medical Director.
    3.3. Installation PAD Medical Director: The PAD Medical Director has medical oversight of the
    PAD Program and synchronizes with the Installation PAD Coordinator on changes/updates in PAD
    response procedures and post actions once a PAD has been deployed or used during an actual event.
    3.4. Installation PAD Coordinator(s): Appointed by the installation commander, the primary and
    alternate PAD Coordinator will be functionally aligned with the duties required to maintain the PAD
    Program and coordinate requirements with all PAD-owning units on the installation. All units
    purchasing new PADs/AEDs will contact the PAD Coordinator, who will in-turn, coordinate with the
    377th Medical Logistics Flight and the Biomedical Equipment Repair Section to inspect and add the
    equipment to the base PAD inventory via Defense Medical Logistics Support System (DMLSS).
    3.5. 377th Medical Logistics Flight (MDSS/SGSL): SGSL will be contacted by the Installation
    PAD Coordinator regarding the acquisition of any AEDIPAD and ensure the new equipment is
    gained into the AED inventory and assigned an Equipment Control Number (ECN). When requested,
    SGSL will produce an AED/ECN inventory for the Installation PAD Coordinator.
    3.6. 377th Biomedical Equipment Repair Section (377 MDSS/SGSLE):                  SGSLE will be
    contacted for any maintenance issues related to AEDs/PADs.
    3.7. The 377th Medical Group Education and Training Flight (377 MDG/SGNE): is available
    to train unit AED/PAD POCs or any appointed unit representative(s) as Basic Life Support (BLS)
    instructors to American Heart Association standards. Candidates for training by the 377 MDG must
    be eligible IAW the Military Training Network (MTN) eligibility standards and will maintain BLS-
    instructor credentials IAW MTN guidance.
       3.7.1. AED/PAD POCs or appointed unit representative(s) not eligible for BLS instructor
       training per MTN eligibility standards must obtain BLS/AED instructor training through an
       alternative agency (e.g. local hospital, American Red Cross) at unit expense.
       3.7.2. 377 MDG/SGNE will advise unit PAD POCs and BLS instructors regarding changes to
       BLS standards, should they occur, as specified in AFMCI 10-301, Public Access Defibrillation
       Program.
    3.8. Unit AED/PAD POCs: Will be appointed by each unit that has AED(s)/PAD(s) by the unit
    commander or command equivalent as per AFMCI 10-301, paragraph 2.6.
       3.8.1. Unit PAD POCs will comply with requirements as specified in AFMCI 10-301, paragraph
       2.7.
       3.8.2. Unit BLS instructors (if different from the PAD POCs) will assist unit PAD POCs and
       ensure BLS training classes are adequate and regularly available to train other unit members
       requiring BLS training.

4. AED Selection:
   4.1. Uniformity. To ensure uniformity, the Installation PAD Coordinator in conjunction with the
   Installation Medical Director will designate a specific model for use on the entire installation for all
   future AED purchases. Such standardization will ensure biomedical equipment maintenance
   technicians are capable of performing required maintenance services on AED/PAD units.
   4.2. Medical Equipment. All medical equipment purchased on the installation will be registered
   with the 377 MDG Biomedical Equipment Repair Section (377 MDG/SGSLE). A master spreadsheet
   of AED/PAD units will be maintained by the Installation PAD Coordinator to ensure unit PAD
   monitors are aware of changes to Public Access Defibrillation (PAD) program.
