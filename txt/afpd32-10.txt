SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include incorporating the concept of common levels of service for civil engineering activities,
2                                                                 AFPD32-10 4 MARCH 2010


Federal Real Property Asset Management, updating office symbols, and clarifying roles and
responsibilities.
1. Employ a sustainable asset management approach using common levels of service by
implementing Activity Management Plans (AMPs) for built and natural assets. This approach
integrates requirements to deliver installation support services needed for mission execution,
provides the capability to advocate for resources, and then supports allocation of the necessary
resources to provide, operate, maintain, and protect facilities, infrastructure, and installations
required for effective mission support worldwide at their lowest life-cycle cost.
    1.2. Provide and retain the minimum number of installations and facilities necessary to
    effectively support Air Force missions and people at the lowest life-cycle cost and in a
    sustainable way. The Air Force will inactivate or dispose of installations and facilities that
    are excess to requirements.
    1.3. Conduct its installations and facilities activities according to applicable laws,
    regulations, Federal policies, international treaties, and host-nation agreements.
    1.4. Determine levels of investment for installations and facilities based on the following
    general priorities: statutory and regulatory compliance, other legal requirements including
    treaties and host-nation agreements, enhanced mission capability, improved living and
    working conditions, and other requirements to ensure the best return on investment.
2. This directive establishes the following responsibilities and authorities:
    2.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Installations, Environment and Logistics
    (SAF/IE) is responsible for installation and facility policy and provides policy oversight as
    prescribed in Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-1, Policy Formulation.
       2.1.1. SAF/IE directs and controls advocacy for resources and the representation of
       installation and facility matters with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) staff,
       Federal agencies, and the Congress.
       2.1.2. SAF/IE oversees the acquisition and disposal of real property through the Air
       Force Real Property Agency, including disposal of Air Force installations required by the
       Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process.
    2.2. The Air Force Civil Engineer, AF/A7C, formulates specific operational and procedural
    guidance to implement broad policy, advocates resources, oversees execution of installations
    and facilities programs, and develops and manages common levels of service in cooperation
    with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics,
    USD(AT&L). Through the Civil Engineer (CE) Governance process, AF/A7C will maintain
    the CE Portal to share non-directive best practices, provide information about CE-related
    processes, and share process improvement feedback.
    2.3. The Chief of the Air Force Reserve, AF/RE, formulates specific operational and
    procedural guidance to implement broad policy, advocates for resources, oversees execution
    of installations and facilities programs, and develops and manages the life-cycle process for
    Air Force Reserve facilities.
    2.4. The Director, Air National Guard, NGB/CF, formulates specific operational and
    procedural guidance to implement broad policy, advocates for resources, oversees execution
AFPD32-10 4 MARCH 2010                                                                          3


   of installations and facilities programs, and develops and manages the life-cycle process for
   Air National Guard facilities.
   2.5. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower, Personnel and Services (AF/A1) through the
   Office of Services (AF/A1S), will advocate for resources for Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF)
   construction programs. AF/A7C oversees programming and execution of these programs.
   2.6. Major Command (MAJCOM) and installation commanders will:
      2.6.1. Develop, operate, maintain, and control the use of Air Force installations and
      facilities in compliance with all applicable Department of Defense (DoD) and Air Force
      policies and procedures.
      2.6.2. Develop comprehensive asset management plans, identify facility and
      infrastructure lifecycle requirements, implement applicable common levels of service,
      assess the impact of asset condition on mission support through the use of key
      performance indicators, and develop and execute real property construction, sustainment,
      restoration, and modernization programs in compliance with this policy.
      2.6.3. Conduct installations and facilities matters through a multifunctional team
      approach using asset management principles and common levels of service.
   2.7. Civil Engineers at all levels, in support of responsible commanders:
      2.7.1. Provide, operate, maintain, restore, and protect the built and natural infrastructure
      necessary to support the Air Force mission.
      2.7.2. Maintain an accurate inventory of all Air Force-controlled real property and real
      property installed equipment with descriptions of current physical condition, capacity,
      size, and uses.
      2.7.3. Implement common standards for the comprehensive planning, design,
      construction, operation, sustainment, restoration, and modernization of real property
      facilities to sustain their value to the Air Force, consistent with Air Force policies.
      2.7.4. Find and employ ways to gain the greatest value from manpower and dollar
      resources used in constructing, operating, and maintaining real property facilities.
      2.7.5. Analyze and recommend changes in facilities use to improve the value of existing
      facilities to Air Force missions.
      2.7.6. Reduce the life-cycle costs of facilities by making full costs of products and
      services visible to customers, by establishing a baseline and tracking costs of individual
      facilities, and by making continuous measurable improvements to facility management.
      2.7.7. Deliver services and products normally associated with facility management and
      operations to include property transactions; construction, sustainment, restoration, and
      modernization; and support of real property installed or similar equipment. These also
      include execution of readiness, environmental, housing, fire and emergency services,
      emergency management, and explosive ordnance disposal responsibilities outlined in
      other AFPDs.
