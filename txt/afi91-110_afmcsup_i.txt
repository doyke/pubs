SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

Range Nuclear Safety Surveys are replaced by Range Nuclear Safety Inspections. The
MAJCOM is assigned responsibility for performing these inspections. Range commanders are
tasked with developing and exercising radiological safety and contingency plans for space and
missile launches carrying radiological materials. They are also responsible for ensuring
radiological issues have a more prominent place in launch readiness reviews. In addition,
threshold quantities for radioactive materials have been increased to match threshold values for
the safe transport of radioactive materials as outlined in the International Atomic Energy
Agency’s, Safety Series 6, Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material, 1996
(Revised). These threshold values are now listed in Terabecquerels (TBQ) instead of Curies to
conform with international standards.

(AFMC) This revision aligns the AFMC supplement with the AFI. Several paragraphs have
been rewritten for clarification and improved readability. This revision updates organizational
office symbols.

     ANALYSIS THRESHOLD QUANTITIES FOR RADIOACTIVE MATERIALS

A2.1. The threshold quantity determines the level of launch approval and depth of analysis.
Local range requirements guide launch approval of radioactive materials below the threshold
quantity.
CAUTION: Threshold quantities do not apply to reactors or other devices when a potential for
criticality is present. The end of this attachment shows the analysis threshold quantities for mixed
fission or unlisted radionuclides and mixtures of radionuclides. HQ AFSC/SEW determines the
necessary level of safety review and approval for quantities that exceed the threshold and for
reactors or other devices where the potential for criticality exists. NOTE: 1 TBq ~ 27.03 Ci

(b) The quantity may be determined from a measurement of the rate of decay or a measurement
of the radiation level at a prescribed distance from the source.

(c) These values apply only to compounds of uranium that take the chemical form of UF6 , UO2
F2 and UO2(NO3)2 in both normal and accident conditions of transport.

(d) These values apply only to compounds of uranium that take the chemical form of UO3 , UF4
, UCl4 and hexavalent compounds in both normal and accident conditions of transport.

(e) These values apply to all compounds of uranium other than those specified in (c) and (d)
above.

(f) These values apply to unirradiated uranium only.

A2.1.1. Treat a mixture of radionuclides resulting from the natural decay of a single-parent
radionuclide as a single source of the parent.
   A2.1.2. When using several isotopes or a mixture of isotopes, base the required nuclear
   safety review on the normalized total quantity of radioactive material present. The
   normalized total is the sum of the ratios of the individual isotopes to their respective
   threshold quantities as shown in Figure A2.1. If the normalized totals exceeds 1.00 a safety
   analysis summary is required. HQ AFSC/SEW must complete a nuclear safety review and
   obtain launch approval from OATSD(NCB).

Figure A2.1. Mixed Isotopes.



    Isotope A (TBq)                Isotope B (TBq)                 Isotope C (TBq)
                               +                               +                       …<1.00
   Threshold A (TBq)               Threshold B (TBq)               Threshold C (TBq)



EXAMPLE:
1.2 x 10-4 TBq of Pu-238 is 1.2 x 10-4TBq/1.0 x 10-3 or 12 percent of the analysis threshold limit
for Pu-238.

0.5 TBq of Nb-95 is 0.5Tbq/1.0Tbq, or 50 percent of the analysis threshold limit for Nb-95.

7.0 TBq of Be-7 is 7.0TBq/20 TBq, or 35 percent of the analysis threshold limit of BE-7.

Therefore, the normalized total is 97 percent and an SAS would not be required.
