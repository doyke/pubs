impounded at the VAFB Stray Animal Facility. Updates animal prohibitions in VAFB housing.
1. Responsibilities:
     1.1. Pet owners will obey all rules in this instruction. Repeat offenders may have their pets
     permanently removed from the base or may have to vacate base quarters.
     1.2. Security Forces will enforce this instruction and are responsible for picking up stray
     animals.
2. Limitations:
     2.1. The following domestic pets are permitted on base:
        2.1.1. Dogs.
        2.1.2. Cats.
        2.1.3. Birds.
        2.1.4. Fish.

        2.2.2. Wild, exotic, or undomesticated animals (e.g., forest/jungle beasts, potbellied pigs,
        or other wildlife). The following pets are prohibited: raccoons, opossums, skunks,
        groundhogs, bats, squirrels, wolves and wild carnivores. The base veterinarian will
        investigate questionable cases and will advise the Mission Support Group Commander,
        who will make the final decision whether a given animal is in a prohibited classification.
        2.2.3. Poisonous reptiles or large constrictor-type snakes
        2.2.4. Hoofed animals, except when kept in a designated base areas and which qualify as

        aggression. Any dog which is a percentage of Pit Bull or Rottweiler, up to half-breed
        dogs of these types is also prohibited. The inbred aggressive nature of this breed creates
        a safety hazard. Owners of the prohibited dog breeds residing off base will be allowed
        access to the base veterinarian clinic.
     2.3. No more than two pets (excluding common caged animals) are permanently permitted in
     any household. Exceptions must be approved in writing by the installation commander or

30SWI31-107 24 JUNE 2010                                                                         3


   CA 93437-6261). NOTE: Newborn cat and dog litters under 12 weeks old do not require
   written approval from the installation commander. However, animals over 12 weeks old
   must be registered through the base veterinarian office.
3. Control of Pets:

       3.2.6. All pet food should be stored inside a storage area where wildlife cannot gain
       access.
4. Procedures:
   4.1. Immunizations. Vaccinate all cats and dogs against rabies with a vaccine listed in the
   Rabies Compendium as having a three year duration of immunity. Vaccinate cats at three
   months of age and one year later, then every three years thereafter. Vaccinate dogs at four
   months of age, one year later and every three years thereafter.
   4.2. Licensing and Display of Vaccination Tags. Once vaccinated, the veterinarian office
   provides each pet owner with a certificate of vaccination and metal license tag. Attach the
   license tag to a collar and display around the pet’s neck at all times. Owners will register all
   cats and dogs with the US Army Veterinary Treatment Facility (30 MDG/SGV, Bldg. 10314,
   Community Loop, Vandenberg AFB CA 93437-6007) on base within 30 days of the pet’s
   arrival. This must be done regardless of where the pet was vaccinated.
   4.3. Impounding of Pets. A pet found running loose (outside the house/fenced yard) is
   evidence the pet owner or custodian is not properly controlling their pet. The Security Forces
   will impound all loose pets and complete a 30 SW Form 313, Animal Impoundment/Release
   Record.
       4.3.1. If a captured pet has a collar with proper license tags, the Security Forces may
       check the registration files and attempt to notify the owner. Pets without tags will be
       transported to the Lompoc animal shelter after the 5 day holding period at the VAFB
       Stray Animal Facility.
       4.3.2. All stray animals picked up will be held at VAFB (Bldg. 11478 located just off
       Utah Avenue on Wagon Wheel Road) for 5 duty days.
4                                                                  30SWI31-107 24 JUNE 2010


       4.3.3. If an owner cannot be contacted or identified after the 5 day holding period the
       animal will be transported to the Santa Barbara County Animal Shelter (SBCAS), 1501
       W Central Avenue, Lompoc, California. The SBCAS will receipt for animals via 30 SW
       Form 313, Animal Impoundment/Release Record.
           4.3.3.1. The SBCAS will hold the animals for the specified time period established
           by the state of California or until such time the animals are adopted, redeemed or
           euthanized.
           4.3.3.2. Owners of pets that have been transported to the SBCAS will abide by the
           laws of the county and pay any and all fines required by the county.
    4.4. Failure to Control Pet violations. When a pet is claimed on base, its owner will pay
    an impoundment fee of $20.00 for the first day and $.50 for each following day.
       4.4.1. When owners claim pets, they will be issued a failure to control pet letter and sign
       the 30 SW Form 313 acknowledging they will pay the impoundment fee within 72 hours.
       The Security Forces will then complete DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher. The
       Owner will take voucher to base finance office located in building 11777 and make
       payment.
       4.4.2. After payment of fees, the owner must return a copy of the DD Form 1131 to 30
       Security Forces Reports and Analysis (30 SFS/S5SR) section in Bldg. 13675 within the
       next duty/work day.
       4.4.3. The stray animal facility is not a “holding kennel” for pets of personnel on leave or
       on temporary duty (TDY). In addition, owners will not leave their pets at the stray
       animal facility when they no longer want them.
    4.5. Animal Bites. The Security Forces immediately investigates all reports of on-base
    animal bites or scratches and will try to catch the pet and identify the owner. If owner is
    identified they will be issued a memorandum titled “Notice of Initial Action for Owners of
    Animals Involved in Bite/Scratch Incident.”
       4.5.1. The individual’s Primary Care Provider (PCP) or next available doctor will
       immediately call the Vandenberg Emergency Communication Center whenever an
       individual is treated for animal bites or scratches and will assist the individual in
       completing DD Form 2341, Animal Bite Report - Potential Rabies Exposure.
       4.5.2. If a dog or cat is suspected or known to be rabid, immediately contact the
       veterinarian office to see if the pet is registered on base or has a current rabies
       immunization.
           4.5.2.1. If the animal has a current rabies vaccination and bites or scratches an
           individual, the animal will be quarantined at the owner’s residence or as directed by
           the base veterinarian until resolution of the incident. For purposes of this action
           “quarantine” is defined as, “not allowing anyone outside the owner’s immediate
           family to have contact with the pet. While in your yard (to include a fenced yard) it
           must be under the owner’s immediate physical control.”
           4.5.2.2. If the animal is unvaccinated, the base veterinarian will quarantine it for ten
           days, at the owner’s expense, at an approved civilian facility chosen by the veterinary
           office. When the pet is released, it must be vaccinated against rabies and if the
30SWI31-107 24 JUNE 2010                                                                     5


            incident has not been resolved the owner must comply with the quarantine
            instructions in paragraph 4.5.2.1.
            4.5.2.3. An owner’s refusal to obey a quarantine restriction will result in an
            automatic forfeiture of base pet privileges.
      4.5.3. The attending veterinarian or designated representative normally examines the
      animal within 24 hours of the incident.
   4.6. Removal of Pets from Base. If a pet is involved in a serious incident, such as an
   animal bite or scratch, or three or more violations of this instruction within a three-year
   period, the 30 MSG/CC will review the incident(s) and may direct the pet to be removed
   from base. The owner will be notified of the decision within ten days of the incident unless
   unusual circumstances prevent the 30 MSG/CC from meeting this goal. When the
   commander orders the pet’s removal, the animal must be removed from Air Force property
   and the owner must present proof the pet has been removed. Proof will be in the form of a
   kennel receipt and/or letter from the person watching the animal with the owner’s
   commander’s endorsement. Proof must be submitted to 30 SFS, Reports and Analysis, 108
   Colorado Ave, VAFB CA 93437 within 24 hours of receipt of the removal letter. If the
   owner feels their pet should not be permanently removed, they may appeal the decision to the
   30 SW/CC at the time they sign acknowledging the removal. Failure to do so constitutes a
   waiver of their right to an appeal.
      4.6.1. Some of the violations that may cause a pet’s removal are:
            4.6.1.1. Owner’s failure to control pets.
            4.6.1.2. Unsanitary conditions (on or off the owner’s premises).
            4.6.1.3. Failure to vaccinate pet.
            4.6.1.4. Disturbance of the peace.
            4.6.1.5. Destruction of property.
            4.6.1.6. Animal bites or scratches (may be removed after one incident).
      4.6.2. If necessary, the installation commander can order occupants to vacate housing.
      Balfour Beatty is responsible for generating this notice.
   4.7. Security Forces Reports. The Security Forces Squadron completes a Failure to
   Control Pet memorandum for all incidents that violate this instruction with the exception of
   animal bites. Animal bite incidents will be reported using AF Form 3545, Incident Report.
   4.8. Domestic Pets in Transient or Guest Quarters. Pets in transient or guest quarters are
   not authorized unless in a designated “pet friendly” TLF.
   4.9. Records. 30 SFS/S5SR keeps records of violations and ensures squadron commanders
   are informed of violations.
