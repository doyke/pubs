Section B—Scale House Procedures

6. Vehicle Positioning. Vehicles must be stopped approximately centered on the scale, with engine
turned off. Either all occupants must be inside the vehicle or outside the vehicle and off the scale area at
the time of weigh-in and weigh-out. The same procedure will be followed during both the weigh-in and
weigh-out procedures (e.g., occupants weighed-in must be weighed-out).

       7.3.1. Date of disposal.
       7.3.2. Name of Individual and Source of Load (e.g., SSgt John Smith/366 CES Zone 1, or Mrs.
       Jones/Housing).
       7.3.3. Type of material. There are two cells: one for household trash and the other for miscella-
       neous materials that are not recycled or recovered.
       7.3.4. Does the vehicle contain recyclable materials? Recyclable materials will be removed by the
       individual before entering the scales.
       7.3.5. Once the recyclable materials are removed, SMO will instruct the driver to proceed to the
       scale. Inform the driver they will be required to weigh-in again after dumping.
    7.4. Annotate the "in" weight on the MSWLF log (Attachment 1) and instruct the individual to the
    proper cell.

8. Weigh-Out. After dumping, vehicles must be re-weighed to calculate the amount of waste dumped.
Annotate the "out" weight on the MSWLF log.

9. Electronic MSWLF log:
    9.1. All MSWLF log data will be transposed to an electronic log maintained at the landfill. The elec-
    tronic MSWLF log will be updated daily by SMO.
