3.5.3.1. (Added) Restrictions. Relationships are unprofessional, whether pursued on or off
duty, when they detract from the authority of superiors or result in, or reasonably create the
appearance of, favoritism, misuse of office or position, or the abandonment of organizational
goals for personal interests. Accordingly, officers and enlisted personnel shall not date or carry
on a social relationship with a cadet or cadet candidate, or seek or engage in sexual activity with,
make sexual advances to, or accept sexual overtures from a cadet or cadet candidate.
3.5.3.2. (Added) Dating Between Graduated, Commissioned Officers, and Cadets: Dating
between graduated, commissioned officers and cadets is not authorized. EXCEPTION: A first-
or second-class cadet who was already dating a cadet from the most recent graduated class prior
to the senior cadet’s graduation, may continue to date that new officer under circumstances that
will not compromise the officer’s status with other cadets. In order to accomplish this, the AOC
must be notified of the prior existing relationship before the senior cadet graduates. When the
new lieutenant dates the cadet, the cadet may be picked up and dropped off at the Academy, but
no other dating activity will occur on the Academy Reservation, except as follows:
3.5.3.2.1. (Added) June Week Activities - only if the cadet is a first-class cadet.
3.5.3.2.2. (Added) 100th Night Activities - only if the cadet is a first-class cadet.
3.5.3.2.3. (Added) Ring Dining Out and Dance - only if the cadet is a second-class cadet.
3.5.3.2.4. (Added) Even 100th Night activities, June Week activities, and the Ring Dining Out
and Dance require specific notification of the AOC in advance of the officer’s participation in
those activities.
3.5.3.3.   (Added) Relationships Between Cadets. See Air Force Cadet Wing Manual
(AFCWMAN) 36-3501, Cadet Sight Picture, for information about professional and
unprofessional relationships by cadets.
3.5.3.4. (Added) Sanctions. This is a punitive instruction. Violations of the specific
prohibitions and requirements of this instruction by military personnel may result in prosecution
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), adverse administrative action, or discharge
from active duty.
