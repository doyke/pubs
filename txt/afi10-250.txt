    INDIVIDUAL MEDICAL READINESS ELEMENTS, CRITERIA AND GOALS

2.1. DoD and Air Force IMR Classification Schema.
   2.1.1. DoDI 6025.19 describes a 4-tiered classification system for reporting individual
   medical readiness: Fully Medically Ready (GREEN), Partially Medically Ready
   (YELLOW), Indeterminate (GRAY) and Not Medically Ready (RED). All AF data reported
   to DoD will be classified using this 4-tiered system. (T-0).
   2.1.2. The AF Active Component and ARC use a two-tiered system that provides a clear
   message to Commanders and members: Fully Mission Capable (GREEN) or Not Mission
   Capable (RED). The classification Partially Mission Capable (YELLOW) is used to report
   IMR elements that are Due (e.g. unmet IMR requirements that can generally be resolved
   within 30 days) but are not yet Overdue or not yet causing a member to be “not medically
   ready”. This is a management category or tool only. All internal AF and ARC reports,
   metrics and statistics will continue to use the two-tiered GREEN/RED system. However, as
   stated in 2.1.1., AF data can easily be translated to DoD classifications when required and is
   always reported this way to DoD. (T-1).
2.2. DoD Instruction 6025. 19. IMR Elements:
   2.2.1. Periodic/Preventive Health Assessment (PHA).
   2.2.2. Dental Readiness.
   2.2.3. Immunization Status.
   2.2.4. Individual Medical Equipment.
   2.2.5. Medical Readiness Laboratory Tests.
   2.2.6. Deployment Limiting Conditions.
2.3. IMR Criteria by Element.
   2.3.1. PHA: PHAs will be conducted annually per AFI 44-170, Preventive Health
   Assessment. (T-0).
      2.3.1.1. For reports to DoD and for internal AF IMR reporting purposes, all AF
      members, including Active Component and ARC members will use the DoDI 6025.19
      definition for medical readiness for PHA currency. The DoDI definition includes a 90-
      day grace period beginning the day the PHA is due (366 days after the last PHA) during
      which time the member will remain “medically ready.” On the day after the grace period
      expires (366 days + 90 days), the member will be determined “not medically ready” and
      will count against the unit’s “medically ready” status (i.e., the PHA is green for 365 days;
      turns yellow (due) on day 366, and turns red (overdue) 90 days later on day 456). Except
      as noted below, all AF and ARC members will follow these guidelines in scheduling to
      maintain PHA currency. (T-0).
      2.3.1.2. Flying and Special Duty Operations personnel will follow existing guidance in
      AFI 44-170. Required examinations for these personnel are in sync with current PHA
      and IMR reporting business rules. (T-1).
8                                                                   AFI10-250 16 APRIL 2014


       2.3.1.3. Reserve members and Non-Unit Reserve Personnel (i.e., Category B and E) will
       follow AFRC/SG guidance for annual PHA periodicity. ANG members will follow AF
       guidance as noted above. However, for IMR reporting purposes, the DoD definition of
       medically ready as defined in 2.3.1.1 will be used. (T-1).
       2.3.1.4. During deployments and for three months following deployment, members will
       not be monitored for PHA currency. PHAs do not need to be accomplished on deploying
       Airmen as long as the PHA is current (within 365 days of the last recorded PHA) on the
       projected Required Delivery Date. Note: For further guidance, refer to AFI 44-170. (T-
       1).
    2.3.2. Dental Readiness.
       2.3.2.1. Members must have a current dental exam and be either dental class 1 or 2 to be
       classified as “medically ready.” Dental examination and classification is required
       annually. Members will be given a grace period beginning the day the dental exam is due
       (366 days after the last dental exam) during which time the member will still be
       considered “medically ready.” For Active Component members, the grace period will
       extend through the end of the month following the month the dental exam became due.
       For ARC members, IAW DoDI 6025.19, the grace period will extend for 3 months after
       the dental exam is due. The first day of the month following the grace period, the member
       will receive a dental classification of 4 and be determined to be “not medically ready”
       and will count against the unit’s “medically ready” status. (T-0).
       2.3.2.2. DoD requires a dental examination and classification annually. When reporting
       dental examination and classification data to DoD, follow DoD definitions and
       requirements as specified in DoDI 6025.19. The DoDI allows a 90-day grace period after
       the dental exam is due. (T-0).
       2.3.2.3. Members who receive a dental classification of 3 will be considered “not
       medically ready” and will count against their unit’s “medically ready” status. Dental class
       3 is considered a deployment limiting condition (see section 2.3.6). (T-0).
       2.3.2.4. The requirements of a dental examination and the specifics of dental readiness
       classification can be found in AFI 47-101, Managing Air Force Dental Services. (T-3).
       2.3.2.5. During deployments and for three months following deployment, members will
       not be monitored for dental examination currency IAW AFI 47-101. Dental
       examinations do not need to be accomplished on deploying Airmen as long as the dental
       examination is current (within 365 days of the last documented dental examination) on
       the projected Required Delivery Date and the member is Dental Class 1 or 2. (T-2).
    2.3.3. Immunizations.
       2.3.3.1. It is DoD and AF policy to follow the Advisory Committee on Immunization
       Practices (ACIP) vaccination recommendations when published by the Centers for
       Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report,
       unless stated otherwise by specific DoD or AF policy. All recommended vaccinations are
       to be kept current. (T-0).
           2.3.3.1.1. Grace periods, when the shot is Due but not Overdue, are allowed for most
           immunizations and during those periods, the member will still count as “medically
AFI10-250 16 APRIL 2014                                                                         9


         ready.” Grace periods vary by immunization and are programmed exclusively into
         ASIMS Web. (T-2).
         2.3.3.1.2. There are also “early periods” where some immunizations may be given
         earlier than the date due. These periods are also programmed into ASIMS Web as
         YELLOW flags and are reflected in its reports. Immunizations given before this early
         YELLOW period, even if given for operational reasons by a licensed provider, may
         not count towards the IMR immunization requirement and may require additional
         doses. In almost all cases, immunizations should be given within the prescribed time
         periods. (T-3).
     2.3.3.2. Immunization requirements are noted elsewhere but are reflected in ASIMS
     Web, which should generally be the source for determining what immunizations are due
     and when they should be given. Some immunizations are specific to a deployment, PCS,
     or TDY location or an occupation and must be loaded as requirements by MAJCOM
     personnel in coordination with the DHA/HIT Solution Delivery Division when these
     requirements are identified. Once the requirement is loaded, the vaccine(s) will reflect as
     Due in ASIMS Web. (T-1).
     2.3.3.3. DoD IMR requirements for immunizations differ from internal AF requirements
     due to the differing functional abilities of the Service’s immunization tracking systems.
     Therefore, when reporting IMR status to DoD, DoD requirements, and not those internal
     to the Air Force, will be used. (T-1).
         2.3.3.3.1. Current DoD IMR required vaccinations IAW DoD Instruction 6025.19,
         Individual Medical Readiness and AFJI 48-110, Immunizations and
         Chemoprophylaxis, 29 Sep 2006: hepatitis A, tetanus, diphtheria (Td or Tdap), MMR
         (measles, mumps, rubella), IPV (inactivated polio vaccine), hepatitis B (if the series is
         initiated) and influenza (once per season). (T-0).
         2.3.3.3.2. Vaccines are considered overdue if more than 30 days has elapsed since
         their due date. Influenza is considered Overdue if not administered by 1 January of
         each year. The influenza requirement is valid from 1 October (or slightly earlier if
         vaccine is available) until 30 June of each fiscal year based on DoDI 6025.19. (T-0).
         2.3.3.3.3. Once in deployed status, members will no longer be monitored for
         individual medical readiness purposes and will remain unmonitored for three months
         post-deployment. Members will continue to be monitored for vaccination status by in-
         theater medical units for force health protection purposes and deployed unit
         commanders will take prudent actions to allow members to be vaccinated when the
         mission allows. Failure to meet vaccination requirements while deployed will not
         affect home unit individual medical readiness status since deployed members are not
         monitored for individual medical readiness. (T-1).
         2.3.3.3.4. Members with validated administrative or medical exemptions are
         excluded from these requirements and reporting. (T-2).
  2.3.4. Individual Medical Equipment.
     2.3.4.1. Some members require special equipment for deployments. The only item
     required for IMR is one pair of gas mask inserts and only for those who meet certain
10                                                               AFI10-250 16 APRIL 2014


     visual acuity deficiencies. All members must have either a recorded distant visual acuity
     to determine if they need gas mask inserts or a record in ASIMS Web that they were
     shipped gas mask inserts from the DoD Spectacle Request Transmission System (SRTS).
     Each of these requirements is only required once and once documented, will not change
     unless a new visual acuity measurement is added to ASIMS Web that drives the
     requirement for a gas mask insert. (T-2).
     2.3.4.2. Once a member is identified as needing a gas mask insert, they will have a 30-
     day grace period during which the inserts are being ordered and shipped. Most sites have
     a direct link to SRTS data and will be updated once this data is uploaded into ASIMS
     Web. After this 30-day grace period, the member will become “not medically ready”
     until ASIMS Web is either updated automatically by the SRTS system or manually with
     an issue date by medical personnel. (T-2).
  2.3.5. Medical Readiness Laboratory Studies.
     2.3.5.1. AF IMR laboratory requirements include those screening tests required upon
     accession: Blood type and Rh factor, G6PD, Hgb-S with positive results confirmed by
     electrophoresis, DNA Specimen Collection and HIV plus any others required from other
     policies. These requirements are all reflected within ASIMS Web and a source document
     will be posted to the Knowledge Exchange at https://kx2.afms.mil. (T-1).
     2.3.5.2. Except for pre-deployment HIV screening, all AF and ARC personnel are
     screened for serological evidence of HIV infection every 24 months. Members will be
     flagged YELLOW at 24 months and will remain yellow for 90 days to allow
     synchronization with the members PHA appointment. (T-1).
     2.3.5.3. A DNA specimen must be logged and stored at the Armed Forces Repository of
     Specimen Samples for the Identification of Remains (AFRSSIR). This site automatically
     updates ASIMS Web when the specimen has been received and logged. Once logged and
     updated in ASIMS Web, this requirement is met and never becomes due again. However,
     specimens that are not received at AFRSSIR or that are received but do not meet
     standards will not count towards IMR requirements and must be re-accomplished. (T-1).
     2.3.5.4. DoDI 6025.19 requirements for IMR laboratory testing are an on-file DNA
     Specimen and a current HIV test. Therefore, when reporting laboratory testing IMR
     status to DoD, these requirements, and not those internal to the Air Force, will be used.
     (T-0).
  2.3.6. Deployment Limiting Conditions. (T-1).
     2.3.6.1. Members must have no deployment limiting condition to be determined
     “medically ready.” Members on a AF Form 469 duty limiting condition, code 31, 37, 81
     recommending “not worldwide qualified” or “not deployable” or having a personnel
     system designator, either an Assignment Limitation Code (ALC)-C (1, 2 or 3) or an
     Assignment Availability Code (AAC) 81, 37 or 31, signifying a deployment limiting
     condition, are determined to be “not medically ready.” (T-1).
     2.3.6.2. Commanders should reference ASIMS Web, contact the member’s provider, or
     the Chief, Aeromedical Services for questions regarding the member’s deployability.
     Note: See AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, AFI 10-203, Duty Limiting

      Conditions, AFI 36-2110, Assignments (Table 2.1 and 2.2), and AFI 41-210, Patient
      Administration Functions, for a description of profiling, Assignment Limitation Codes
      and Assignment Availability Codes. (T-1).
2.4. IMR Goals. (T-1).
   2.4.1. The AF goal for IMR is 80%. Note: the AF goal of 80% reflects those Service
   members that are considered “Fully Medically Ready.” Refer to DoDI 6025.19, Individual
   Medical Readiness, for DoD current goal and category requirements. (T-1).
   2.4.2. There are no goals for each element score. Reports that provide medically ready
   statistics by element display all personnel who are current or non-current for that element.
   Personnel may be non-current for more than one element, but will only count against the unit
   IMR score once. For example, Airman 1 is non-current in 3 elements and Airman 2 is non-
   current in only 1 element; they both count against the unit IMR score equally and only once.
   Airman 1 needs to correct 3 items to bring the unit IMR score up, but Airmen 2 only needs to
   correct 1 item to bring the unit IMR score up.
