This addendum compliments AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization
Reporting, and the Air Combat Command (ACC) supplement. It applies to all Battle Control
Centers (previously known as Air Defense Sector) ACC units. It applies to the Air National
Guard. It does not apply to the Air Force Reserve Command. Ensure that all records created as
a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force
Manual 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/. Contact supporting records managers as
required. Send recommended changes or comments using AF Form 847, Recommendation for
Change of Publication, to HQ ACC/A6O, 180 Benedict Ave, Suite 230, Langley AFB VA

1. General. The minimum essential subsystem list (MESL) is the basis of status reporting in
accordance with AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting. MESLs
lay the ground work for reporting the status of command and control (C2) system availability.
They list the minimum essential systems and subsystems that must work on a national security
system for it to perform specifically assigned unit wartime, peacetime, counter drug, training,
test or other missions (i.e. Operation Noble Eagle).
   1.1. Qualifying notes are used to define system exceptions and help explain complex
   degraded mission systems such as the playback and recording servers.

        1.2. National Security System and Information Technology (NSS-IT) system status for
        mission accomplishment: The goal is to support missions assigned to the NSS-IT system,
        recognizing status actually achieved may be less than fully mission capable. A not mission
        capable (NMC) status of a battle control center’s NSS-IT systems will require transfer of
        operational responsibilities whenever the NMC condition exceeds acceptable time limits.
        1.3. All Combat Air Force (CAF) units will use this ACC MESL as a guideline for
        determining mission capability and status reporting.
        1.4. Reading the MESL. A MESL is read by comparing the systems stated by work unit
        code (WUC) against the Full Systems List (FSL) and all applicable Basic Systems Lists
        (BSL) across the page. Each unit's Design Operational Capability (DOC) statement
        determines applicability of BSL columns. The weapons system MESLs incorporate all ACC
        assigned systems and therefore it is important to compare only those columns listed in the
        MESL, which are applicable to the unit's assigned mission. For example, units with CC
        (wartime) coded mission would determine and report status using only the FSL and BSL
        columns directly related to their DOC statement. Air Sovereignty Alert (ASA) is the primary
        mission of the battle control centers. Units with test coded mission system would determine
        and report status using only the FSL and training columns.

QUALIFYING NOTES:
1. Declaration of PMC or NMC on this item is dependant on the mission requirements as
determined by the BCC MCC, at the time of the failure. The extent and specific nature of the
systems failure when combined with the geographical locations effected by the failure, estimated
time of return to operation (ETRO) of the system that failed, time of day, and number of missions
being actively accomplished at the time of the failure, will all influence the MCCs decision on
declaring PMC or NMC and the subsequent decision for a full or partial expansion. NCS can be
used as a limited capability back-up in the event of a total BCS-F failure.

2. NCS is only being used as the primary mission systems for NCR IADS until BCS-F capabilities
come on line. If the EDS NCS is NMC then WDS will be required to expand into the National
Capital Region.

QUALIFYING NOTES:
1. PMC if one is inoperative, NMC if both are inoperative.
2. Mission Capability: The decision lies with MCC due to mixture of radars and types on Radiant
Mercury and PROCONS. Increment 3 has 3 pair of redundant spares, any one of which can
process the entire IP radar load.
3. PMC if Gateway Manager is processing some but not all data links, NMC if not processing
required mission data links. Link requirements are mission dependent. Mission Status may be
discretion of Mission Crew Commander.
4. Declaration of PMC or NMC on this item is dependent on the mission requirements as
determined by the BCC MCC, at the time of the failure. The extent and specific nature of the
systems failure when combined with the geographical locations effected by the failure, estimated
time of return to operation (ETRO) of the system that failed, time of day, and number of missions
being actively accomplished at the time of the failure, will all influence the MCCs decision on
declaring PMC or NMC and the subsequent decision for a full or partial expansion.

QUALIFYING NOTES:
1. NCS is only being used as the primary mission systems for NCR IADS until all BCS-F
capabilities come on line. If the EDS NCS is NMC then WDS will be required to expand into the
National Capital Region.
