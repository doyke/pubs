SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises 59 MDWI 41-133 by adding 59 MDW Form 154, Temporary Duty
Restriction requirement. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.
1. General.
     1.1. Authorized admissions. Active duty military personnel who are unable to perform their
     duties for medical reason, or whose condition might place co-workers at risk of infection,
     will be placed on quarters. Per AFI 41-210, TRICARE Operations and Patient
     Administration Functions, paragraph 4.14.1 “a quarter’s patient is treated on an outpatient
     basis, and is to remain in their home during the quarter’s period. Quarters periods generally
     last 24-72 hours depending on the provider’s prescribed rest/recovery period”.
     1.2. Unit commanders and supervisors have the authority to grant up to 24 hours sick status
     at their discretion if a member’s illness/injury does not require Military Treatment Facility
     (MTF) intervention. If the illness/injury persists beyond 24 hours, the commander or
     supervisor must refer the member to the MTF for treatment and subsequent clinical
     examination.
     1.3. Duration of quarters status:
        1.3.1. Quarters is a full duty excuse where the service member is treated on an outpatient
        basis and is generally returned to duty within a 72-hour period. There is no restriction as
        to the number of times a patient can be put on quarters, but it cannot extend past the 72-
        hour period without reevaluating the patient.           Providers may not recommend
        convalescent leave to cover an extended quarters period. When the complication is due
        to pregnancy, indicate OB Patients on Section 1 of the 59 MDW Form 4015. There is no
        duration limitation, but the attending provider must see the patient at least weekly.
        1.3.2. Per AFI 41-210, paragraph 4.14.4, physician assistants and nurse practitioners
        may not place a patient on quarters for longer than 48 hours without the approval of a
        physician.
        1.3.3. When an individual is placed on 24-hour quarters, the period expires the next day
        at the start of patient’s regular work shift not 24-hours from the time the patient was
        placed on quarters. For 48 hours, the period extends to the start of work on the second
        day and for 72 hours, it extends to the start of work on the third day, not to exceed 24, 48,
        or 72 hours respectively. Unless instructed otherwise, clinic personnel will inform the
        patient to report for duty in accordance with the guidelines above.
        1.3.4. Exception to Time Limits. A provider may place a pregnant female on prenatal
        quarters for the duration of the pregnancy, if necessary.
2. Responsibilities.
     2.1. Responsibility for the management of the quarters program is accomplished by the
     clinic placing the individual on quarters.
     2.2. Providers will complete 59 MDW Form 4015 to place the patient on quarters.
59MDWI41-133 18 APRIL 2013                                                                   3


       2.2.1. For members who are in a trainee status, Reid Clinic is authorized to utilize 59
       MDW Form 154, Temporary Duty Restriction, as an acceptable notification of duty
       limitations. This form will replace 59 MDW Form 4015 for Reid Clinic's use only.
3. Procedures. When an active duty patient is placed on quarters, the following procedures will
be followed:
   3.1. Providers will complete Sections I and II of the 59 MDW Form 4015 in three copies.
   The clinic providing care will make the required notifications.
   3.2. Clinic personnel will:
       3.2.1. Complete Sections III and IV of the quarters authorization form.
       3.2.2. Have patient read, sign, and complete Section IV of the quarters authorization
       form.
       3.2.3. Contact patient’s Commanders Support Staff (CSS) to make quarter’s notification.
       If the patient’s squadron does not have a CSS, contact his/her First Sergeant or
       supervisor. Give only the following information: Name, rank, date of birth, and duration
       of quarters.
       3.2.4. Contact Public Health Office in case of communicable disease.
       3.2.5. Distribute completed 59 MDW Form 4015 to the patient’s records.
   3.3. Patients will:
       3.3.1. Distribute one copy to their CSS and one copy to their supervisor upon returning
       to duty.
