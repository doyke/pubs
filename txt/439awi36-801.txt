1. Responsibility.
     1.1. Commanders and supervisors hold overtime work by civilian employees to a minimum
     consistent with essential operations and emergency peak workloads of a temporary nature.
     1.2. To the extent possible, supervisors plan their activities in a manner to preclude
     overtime/compensatory work.        In accordance with applicable regulatory guidance,
     alternatives such as change in work schedule, adjusting work priorities, suspending
     participation in physical fitness program, etc., should be utilized to eliminate or reduce
     overtime/compensatory time. Examples:              a. Employee works Monday – Friday.
     Employee is scheduled to work OT/CT on Saturday to support UTA. Change work schedule
     to Tuesday – Saturday to eliminate OT/CT. b. Employee is scheduled to work OT/CT for 3
439AWI36-801 22 AUGUST 2013                                                                     3


   hours on Thursday after work hours auditing unit timecards. Employee does PFP on Monday
   and Wednesday. Suspend PFP to use hours to do timecard audit reducing or eliminating
   need for OT/CT on Thursday.
      1.2.1. Physical fitness leave will not be granted on the same day as credit hours/
      overtime/compensatory time work is approved except when the requirement for credit
      time, overtime or compensatory time was not known in advance of the PFP time.
      1.2.2. All reasonable alternatives will be considered prior to scheduling a civilian
      employee to perform duty on a Federal Holiday.
      1.2.3. Temporary duty (TDY) travel should be scheduled within an employee’s regularly
      scheduled tour of duty to the maximum extent possible to avoid paying overtime when
      applicable under Title 5, CFR.
          1.2.3.1. When an employee covered by Compressed Work Schedule (CWS) or
          Flexible Work schedule (FWS) is TDY for school, conferences, etc., the employee
          will be required to follow a traditional regular fixed schedule (8 hours a day, 40 hours
          a week) during pay periods of the TDY unless the temporary work site is operating on
          a CWS or FWS for the TDY purpose. Hours will correspond to the hours of the TDY
          location. The same principle will apply if the employee is scheduled for school,
          conference, etc., at home station.
      1.2.4. Overtime/compensatory time cannot be approved for training unless time spent in
      training complies with the requirements in Title 5, CFR.
2. Premium Pay.
   2.1. Approving/Authorizing Officials for Premium Pay. The wing and group commanders
   are the Approving/Authorizing Official for overtime, holiday premium pay and
   compensatory time. The Approving/Authorizing authority may be delegated to persons
   acting for these commanders only in their absence. The individual signing in the absence of
   the wing or group commander must add the remark “In lieu of CC” (ILO CC).
      2.1.1. Approving/authorizing officials should be aware that they are committing
      government funds for overtime. Compensatory time, unused after 1 year, converts to an
      overtime payment; thus, incurring additional expenditure of funds.
   2.2. Requests for Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay and Compensatory Time. Supervisors
   request and justify overtime/holiday/compensatory time work in writing. Supervisors who
   consider overtime/holiday/compensatory time work essential will use the AF Form 428,
   Request for Overtime, Holiday Premium Pay, and Compensatory Time, to obtain approval
   from the overtime Approving/Authorizing Official before ordering overtime, holiday
   premium pay, and compensatory time earned for their employees. Exception: In an
   emergency, the supervisor may order overtime/holiday/compensatory time without
   authorization, but must document the time no later than the following workday/business day
   and obtain approval. It is the command policy that GS-12 and above employees should not
   normally receive premium pay for overtime work unless circumstances dictate otherwise.
   Students should not receive premium pay for overtime/holiday/compensatory time work
   unless unusual circumstances dictate otherwise.
   2.3. Supervisor will:
4                                                             439AWI36-801 22 AUGUST 2013


       2.3.1. Prepare a separate AF Form 428 for each pay period involved. In the justification
       section,     completely     explain,    in    sufficient    detail,    the    need   for
       overtime/holiday/compensatory time work and ramifications if not performed. Quantify,
       all or any, monetary or mission impact as necessary. Use the reverse side of the form if
       additional space is needed. Specify the hours and the lunch period if applicable.
       2.3.2. At a minimum, route the AF Form 428 to the applicable Group Resource Advisor
       and Group Commander, to expedite timely processing.
       2.3.3. Upon receipt of the approved AF Form 428, notify the employee of the
       requirement to work overtime/holiday/compensatory time. Authorization must be
       received prior to accomplishing the work or no later than one workday/business day after,
       in emergency situations.
       2.3.4. After the work is performed, and if the overtime/holiday/compensatory time was
       over the estimate, accomplish a new AF Form 428 to cover the additional hours and route
       it to the Approving/Authorizing Official for approval of the adjustment. If the time
       worked was less than the estimate, you may accomplish a “pen-and-ink” correction to the
       form.
       2.3.5. For travel compensatory time, annotate the AF Form 428 with the time of the
       travel and attach the travel itinerary for hours being requested for travel. Travel outside
       of regular working hours between an employee's home and the transportation terminal
       within the limits of the employee’s official duty station is not considered creditable travel
       time and must not be included as compensatory time for travel. This time is considered
       normal home to work/work to home travel. If the travel time was over the estimate,
       accomplish a new AF Form 428 to cover the additional hours and route it to the
       Approving/Authorizing Official for approval of the adjustment. If the travel time was
       less than the estimate, you may accomplish a “pen-and-ink” correction to the form.
           2.3.5.1. The approving/authorizing official for travel compensatory time is delegated
           to the supervisor. Compensatory time off for travel not used by the end of the 26th
           pay period after the pay period during which it was earned is not paid out and is
           forfeited. AF Form 428 does not require routing to the resource advisor. Note: If
           the overtime/compensatory/time/holiday/travel comp was approved, but not needed,
           line through the dates/hours, change the total and attach to the AFRC Form 270,
           AFRC Timecard Worksheet.
       2.3.6. Provide the timekeeper with timecard and approved AF Form 428.
    2.4. The Group Resource Advisor will verify that funds are available for premium pay,
    annotate the fund site on the AF Form 428 and forward to authorizing/approving official.
    2.5. The Authorizing/Approving Official will:
       2.5.1. Approve or disapprove AF Form 428 and return form to the requesting
       unit/supervisor.
    2.6. Only after final approval of the AF Form 428 and the overtime/holiday/compensatory
    time has been worked will premium pay be entered on the timecard. Supervisor will verify
    the approval of all paid time before hours from the timecard are entered in the Defense
    Civilian Pay System (DCPS).
439AWI36-801 22 AUGUST 2013                                                                   5


       2.6.1. When the request date on the AF Form 428 is before the start of the
       administrative workweek the overtime is to be worked, use Scheduled Overtime (OS)
       code. When the request date on the AF Form 428 is after the start of the administrative
       workweek the overtime is to be worked, use Unscheduled Overtime (OU) code.
   2.7. Timekeeper will:
       2.7.1. Ensure hours on the timecard match hours approved on the AF Form 428.
       2.7.2. Ensure hours in ATAAPS match AF Form 428.
       2.7.3. Print a copy of the Master Time History sheet from DCPS after the end of the pay
       period and after any corrections input to DCPS. The timecard will be compared to the
       Master Time History sheet to ensure the employee's time was input correctly.
       2.7.4. Maintain the approved AF Form 428, timecard, Master Time History, and travel
       itinerary if applicable, for a period of six years for audit purposes after recording the
       overtime/holiday/compensatory time.
       2.7.5. Correct audit findings and report corrective action taken on the audit sheet.
       Forward a copy to 439 MSG/DPCE.
3. Compensatory Time. Subject to the provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and
5 CFR, Part 551, Pay Administration under the Fair Labor Standards Act, supervisors may grant
compensatory time off to compensate employees for overtime work performed. Compensatory
time off cannot be mandated for Federal Wage System (FWS) employees or General Schedule
(GS) employees who are nonexempt from the FLSA. Nonexempt FWS and GS employees must
be given premium pay for overtime work unless the employee requests compensatory time off.
   3.1. AF Form 428 will indicate if the employee requested compensatory time off for
   overtime worked. Place statement that employee requested compensatory time in the
   justification block. Compensatory time off cannot be granted for holiday work.
4. Paid Overtime.
   4.1. Subject to provisions of the FLSA, and 5 CFR, Part 551, employees are paid for
   overtime worked when it is not practical or possible to authorize compensatory time off for
   overtime work.
   4.2. Employees are paid for overtime work when, because of immediate need of their
   services, authorized compensatory time off could not be taken by the close of the 26th pay
   period following the period in which overtime work was performed. Supervisors should
   make every attempt to schedule compensatory time off to prevent it from accumulating for an
   employee.
       4.2.1. Compensatory time off may be granted prior to the use of annual leave except
       when annual leave would otherwise be forfeited. Supervisors will make every effort to
       schedule use or lose annual leave so that compensatory time off is not paid out unless
       absolutely necessary.
5. Recording Overtime. Overtime/holiday/compensatory time work is recorded on the
timecard in quarter-hour increments.
6. Audits.
 6                                                             439AWI36-801 22 AUGUST 2013


     6.1. 439 AW/FMFPC will conduct quarterly audits on timekeepers to ensure compliance.
     Audits will be random and consist of reviewing three timekeepers’ records per quarter.
     6.2. 439 MSG/DPCE will conduct quarterly premium pay audits. Audits will include Wing
     staff, Group CC, Air Reserve Technician (ART) supervisors and at a minimum a random
     sample of 25% of all civilian employees to include ART employees. Audit finding will be
     documented in writing and a copy maintained in the timecard folder. A final report of
     findings will be provided to the 439 AW/CC.
     6.3. A statement showing that the audit was completed will be filed in the individual
     employee’s folder.
        6.3.1. All errors will be tracked for corrective action.
     6.4. Supervisor and/or timekeeper will conduct self-inspection audits of assigned timecard
     folders and must use the timecard audit folder checklist to ensure compliance.
7. Reports. Management reports are provided on a bi-weekly basis to assist supervisors in
managing their civilian workforce as it relates to leave and premium pay. Sample reports are
provided in Attachment 1 through Attachment 8.
     7.1. Attachment 2, Leave Availability Report, P6602R01. This report provides the

     compensatory are used.
     7.4. Attachment 5, Overtime/Compensatory Usage Review. P6602R04. This report is a tool
     to assist supervisors in monitoring compensatory time. Specific conditions will be monitored
     with regard to usage of overtime and compensatory time. The conditions will be printed on
     the report and identified with code(s) for any active employee who meets one of the
     following conditions.
        7.4.1. Employee paid overtime or credited compensatory time and used annual leave
        during the same period.
