                                                 INTRODUCTION

1. This qualification training package (QTP) was developed to make a training aid available that will assist Surgical
Services Technicians to develop technical skills essential to performing specialized tasks. The tasks are broken
down into teachable elements that help the trainer guide the trainee into becoming proficient with the task. The QTP
will also aid the task certifier when evaluating trainees for task certification.

2. As a trainer, go through each module (lesson) and identify which QTP tasks are appropriate for the trainee’s duty
position, and then determine the order in which you want the trainee to learn about each subject area. Direct the
trainee to review the training references to better understand the objective of each module. Go through the steps in
the task performance with the trainee and allow for enough time to learn each step; some objectives may take more
time than others. Remember, the objective of the QTP is to ensure the trainee can perform each task thoroughly.
When the trainee receives enough training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation
instructions. Use the performance checklist as you evaluate each objective. If the trainee successfully accomplishes
the objective, document appropriately in the individual’s training record. If the trainee does not accomplish the
objective, review the areas needing more training until the objective is met. Conduct a feedback with the trainee on
each module. After the trainer has ensured and documented that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, a
certifier should evaluate the trainee.

3. The goal of the developers of this QTP is to publish a useful document for trainers and trainees that will meet Air
Force needs under the concepts outlined in the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). We value your
expertise in meeting this goal. If you find discrepancies in this QTP, or have suggestions for its improvement, or if
you have suggestions for other areas that may benefit from a QTP, please let us know about them by contacting the

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent risk factors,
and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and
correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the trainee dons all personal
protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions.

3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task without assistance.

4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be documented
in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation should be documented
using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved substitute record.

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:

   1. This QTP should be evaluated during actual performance of the tasks.

   2. Since this task involves direct patient care, ensure the trainee understands the process, knows inherent risk factors,
   and is closely supervised during the evaluation. The evaluator will STOP the procedure immediately and
   correct the trainee if performance may compromise patient safety. Ensure the trainee dons all personal
   protective equipment (PPE) required by current standards/precautions and follows applicable radiation safety
   guidelines.

   3. The trainee must satisfactorily perform all parts of the task with 100% accuracy, without assistance.

   4. Use the appropriate checklist when evaluating the task to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished.

   5. Document competency upon satisfactory completion of the evaluation. Initial evaluation should be documented
   in the Specialty Training Standard (STS) of the trainee’s CFETP. All recurring evaluation should be documented
   using AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, or using an approved substitute record.
