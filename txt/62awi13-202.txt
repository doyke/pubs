1.1. Control Tower. The control tower is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including
weekends and holidays.
1.2. Control Tower Evacuation:
     1.2.1. Circumstances may exist that require the evacuation of the control tower. Evacuate
     the control tower due to:
     1.2.1. 1 Tower Wind Limitations:
        1.2.1.1. 1 The tower is evacuated when the wind velocity reaches 70 knots (steady or in
        gusts) or when deemed necessary by the watch supervisor/senior controller.
            1.2.1.1.2. Controllers will proceed to Airfield Management Operations (AMOPS) in
            Bldg 1172 and standby until the wind diminishes to 65 knots and is forecast to
            subside.
        1.2.1.2. Fire.
        1.2.1.3. Bomb Threat (received or when a bomb is located within 500 feet of the tower).
     1.2.2. One controller will remain available to assist in re-opening the tower.
     1.2.3. When directed by the 62 AW Emergency Operations Center, implement shelter-in-
     place procedures IAW the 62 AW Contingency Action Plan.
     1.2.4. Tower will activate the Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS) to relay the evacuation
     action and any other pertinent information.
     1.2.5. AMOPS will activate the secondary crash alarm circuit to notify all concerned
     agencies that the tower has been evacuated and issue an appropriate NOTAM.
     1.2.6. The watch supervisor/senior controller ensures all local area traffic lands or diverts,
     and ensures a blanket broadcast on all assigned frequencies before evacuating for any of the
     situations outlined above.
1.3. Continuity of Air Traffic Services. Based on the control tower's construction and
equipment reliability, the 62 OG Commander has determined that a designated alternate control
tower facility is not required at McChord Field.
1.4. Evacuation of Airfield Management Facility (Bldg 1172). In the event that Bldg 1172
evacuates, AMOPS personnel will report to Hangar 4 (Room 4-201) and standby for further
instructions.
62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                           7


1.5. Runway. McChord’s runway 16/34 is 10,108 feet long and 150 feet wide. Field elevation
is 322’ MSL. The overruns are 1,000 feet long by 150 feet wide with asphalt composition. The
southernmost 1,000 feet of the runway is composed of approximately 13 inches of concrete. The
remaining 9,108 feet is flexible asphalt, generally less than 5 inches thick, over crushed gravel.
NOTE: Because of the flexible construction and relatively narrow (150 feet) width, special
restrictions apply to heavy aircraft on the flexible portion of the runway. Unless absolutely
essential, 180-degree turns on and off the flexible portion of the runway are prohibited for heavy
aircraft.
1.6. Controlled Movement Area (CMA). The controlled movement area (CMA) is defined as
the runway, overruns, taxiways, and other areas of the airfield which are utilized for taxiing,
hover taxiing, air taxiing, takeoff and landing, exclusive of loading ramps and parking areas.
The McChord Field CMA is the portion of the movement area that requires Tower approval to
access; specifically, the runway, overruns, and landing zone, up to the Instrument and/or Visual
Flight Rule (VFR) hold lines and within 100 feet of the runway, overruns, and the landing zone's
edges (see Attachment 2 for airfield diagram).
1.7. Uncontrolled Movement Areas:
   1.7.1. Taxiways. McChord’s taxiways include: Alpha, 100 feet wide (at narrowest point);
   Bravo, 75 feet wide; Charlie, 75 feet wide; Delta, 100 feet wide; Echo, 390 feet wide (at
   narrowest point); Foxtrot, 75 feet wide; Hotel, 75 feet wide; Juliet, 75 feet wide, Kilo, 75 feet
   wide, Lima, 75 feet wide. (Attachment 2.) NOTE: Use of Taxiway Kilo requires 62
   OG/CC approval for taxiing aircraft.
   1.7.2. Parking ramps. Primary ramps are Bravo B1-B8; Charlie C1-C9, Delta D1-D19
   (transient), D25-D31, and D32-D43 (Delta Extension); Echo E1-E23; Foxtrot F1-F30, F32,
   F34-F35, F38-F39, F40; Juliet J1-J15; Kilo 2; Lima L1. NOTE: Aircraft must use the north
   Juliet Ramp taxilane to park on spots B-7 and B-8.
1.8. Visual and Radio Blind Spots. Visual blind spots from the control tower without
electronic aids are: Delta transient ramp located behind Hangars 1 and 2, southwestern portion
of Taxiway Hotel leading to south hammerhead, Taxiway Juliet, and Echo Ramp. Control tower
is not aware of any radio blind spots. NOTE: An intranet-based camera system allows visual of
Echo Ramp, Delta Ramp, and a portion of Juliet Taxiway.
1.9. Ground Navigational Aid (NAVAID) Checkpoint. The ground NAVAID checkpoint is
located at south hammerhead.
1.10. Permanently Closed/Unusable Portions of the Airfield. There are two permanently
closed/unusable portions: (1) the north-south taxiway (east of Taxiway Hotel and west of the
landing strip) and (2) the east-west taxiway (east of the runway and north of Taxiway Bravo).
1.11. Wingtip Clearance Reference Lines. There are C-17 wingtip clearance reference lines
painted in both hammerheads (Taxiways Alpha and Echo). The closest line to taxiway centerline
is the actual wingtip reference and the outboard lines represent 10-foot and 25-foot clearance
(see Attachment 12).
1.12. Restricted Areas. Depiction and description of McChord Field restricted areas and
associated entry control points can be found in 62 AWI 13-201, Airfield Driving.
1.13. Suspending Runway Operations:

     1.13.1. The tower supervisor will suspend runway operations and notify AMOPS if
     necessary when an unsafe condition is observed on the airfield. AMOPS must temporarily
     suspend/close runway operations when any unsafe condition affects runway operations (e.g.,
     FOD, severe bird/wildlife activity, snow and ice removal checks, arresting systems
     maintenance/configuration changes, airfield construction, pavement repair, etc.). The
     suspension/closure announcement will be accompanied with the time runway operations are
     expected to resume. Prior to resuming normal operations AMOPS personnel will conduct a
     runway check. If alert aircraft are present and the runway is temporarily closed, the Tower
     supervisor or AMOPS supervisor notifies Command Post (CP). CP will notify WADS
     Mission Crew Commander (MCC).
     1.13.2. After determining that normal operations can be resumed, the AMOPS supervisor
     reopens the runway, advises Tower, and notifies CP of any change in runway status. CP will
     notify WADS MCC when the runway is back to operational status.
1.14. Daily Runway Inspections. AMOPS conducts runway inspections at least once daily.
Runway inspections are given priority to the maximum extent possible; if necessary, practice
approach aircraft will receive restricted low approaches during the inspections.
1.15. Runway Selection. Tower will determine the active runway IAW FAAO 7110.65, Air
Traffic Control.
     1.15.1. Preferred Runway:
        1.15.1.1. Runway 34 is the preferred runway between 0500L and 2300L, except when
        tailwind component is 5 knots or more.
        1.15.1.2. Conflicting Wind Information. If conflicting wind information is received,
        Tower supervisor will designate runway 34 as the runway in use unless runway 16 is
        more advantageous due to weather, traffic, etc.
     1.15.2. Noise Abatement:
        1.15.2.1. In the interest of fostering positive community relations, the following
        procedures apply between 2300L-0500L, 7 days a week. If surface wind is 10 knots or
        less and other conditions permit, Tower coordinates with Seattle Approach Control to
        designate direction of traffic as follows:
            1.15.2.1.1. Land runway 34.     Arriving aircraft will make a straight-in full-stop
            landing only.
            1.15.2.1.2. Depart runway 16.
        1.15.2.2. Exceptions to noise abatement procedure times must be approved by the 62 OG
        Commander. Requests must be received at least 24 hours in advance.
1.16. Runway Change:
     1.16.1. Tower coordinates with Seattle Approach Control, base weather station, and
     AMOPS.
     1.16.2. AMOPS notifies the 62 AW CP and Barrier Maintenance between 0730L-1630L,
     Monday-Friday, or the Fire Department during all other times. Upon notification, Barrier
     Maintenance or Fire Department will configure the cables as required.

1.17. Runway Surface Condition (RSC)/Runway Condition Reading (RCR) Check. When
weather conditions deteriorate, AMOPS will perform RSC/RCR checks as necessary. (Only
restricted low approaches are authorized during check periods.)
   1.17.1. When an RCR check is performed on the runway, an RCR check is also performed
   on Taxiway Hotel.
   1.17.2. RCR values (Table 1.1) are recorded on AFTO Form 277, Results of Runway
   Braking Test, and filed with the Airfield Inspection/Check forms.
   1.17.3. Report the RCR to CP, Weather, and Tower (ATC). NOTE: When passing the
   RCR to Tower, also report the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) braking
   action descriptions.

Table 1.1. Runway Condition Readings.
 NOTE: The minimum required RCR for the C-17 is RCR 05 on the runway; RCR 04 on
 Taxiway Hotel.

1.18. Airfield Conditions:
   1.18.1. AMOPS provides current information to Tower and the CP on construction,
   obstructions, and airfield conditions. Tower provides AMOPS and Seattle Approach Control
   with observed or reported field conditions and NAVAID outages when such conditions have
   not been reported by AMOPS.
   1.18.2. Civil Engineering (CE) personnel maintain the BAK-12/E-5 barrier arresting system
   and airfield lighting systems. The CE team supervisor will:
       1.18.2.1. Notify AMOPS of the type maintenance, location, and hazardous conditions
       existing during maintenance operations. AMOPS will relay this information to the
       Tower.
       1.18.2.2. Notify AMOPS prior to entering the airfield, when work is complete, and when
       departing the airfield.
       1.18.2.3. Request permission from the tower to enter, operate, and exit the Controlled
       Movement Area (CMA) IAW 62 AWI 13-201, Airfield Driving.
   1.18.3. CE personnel maintain the grass height at 7 to 14 inches along the taxiways and
   runway. AMOPS ensures grass height is maintained within standards during daily airfield
   inspections and will contact CE personnel when necessary. Any damage to airfield signage
   will be reported to AMOPS immediately.
1.19. Airfield Lighting. Airfield lighting shall be operated IAW FAA Order 7110.65, Air
Traffic Control, and this directive.
   1.19.1. McChord has the following airfield lighting: Rotating beacon, high intensity runway
   edge lights, 1-step taxiway lights, runway centerline lights, non-standard gated threshold

      1.19.1.2. Runway 16 has ALSF-1 (Approach Lights with Sequence Flashing Lights).
   1.19.2. Runway environment lights (i.e., edge, approach, centerline, touchdown zone, etc.)
   will be turned off except when needed by arriving and departing aircraft. Intensity settings
   are maintained IAW FAA Order 7110.65 at all times to ensure accurate RVR readings.
   However, Tower may increase or decrease intensity settings when specifically requested by
   the pilot.
   1.19.3. Taxiway lights will be turned off except when required for aircraft ground
   movement. Taxiway Foxtrot is not equipped with taxiway lights and is for daytime/Visual
   Flight Rules only (unless temporary taxi lights have been installed).
1.20. Aircraft Arresting Systems:
   1.20.1. BAK-12 installation requires 30 minutes prior notice. Requests will be made
   through AMOPS. Additionally, a 15-minute period between successive engagements should
   be used for planning purposes.
   1.20.2. The standard aircraft arresting system configuration for runways 16/34:
      1.20.2.1. The North and South BAK-12s are normally disconnected and removed from
      the runway.
      1.20.2.2. The departure end E5 cable for the runway in use is connected on the overrun.

      NOTE 1: To the maximum extent possible, consistent with operational requirements and
      safety, Tower gives priority to Barrier Maintenance/Fire Department personnel when
      connecting/disconnecting arresting systems. AMOPS shall temporarily suspend/close
      runway operations when arresting systems maintenance/configuration changes. During
      reconfiguration, arriving aircraft can expect restricted low approaches and departing
      aircraft can expect ground delays. Barrier Maintenance/Fire Department will respond
      within 15 minutes to reconfigure cables. AMOPS will complete an airfield check and
      barrier inspection and report the airfield status prior to resuming runway operations.

      NOTE 2: When tail-hook equipped aircraft are operating out of McChord Field, cable
      configuration will be different than described above. Normally the departure end BAK-
      12 and E-5 will be connected. Each flying unit will request what cable configuration is
      desired on a real-time basis.

      NOTE 3: The south E-5 is located 102’ into the runway 16 overrun. The southern
      BAK-12 is located 1,668’ from the approach end of runway 34. The northern BAK-12 is
      located 2,450’ from the approach end of runway 16. The north E-5 is located 240’ into
      the runway 34 overrun.
   1.20.3. Tower will initiate standard emergency procedures when advised of an unplanned
   engagement or when an unplanned engagement occurs.

      GROUND MOVEMENT AND DEPARTURE CLEARANCE PROCEDURES

2.1. Control of Ground Traffic:
   2.1.1. The CMA is the portion of the movement area that requires Tower approval to access,
   specifically: the runway, overruns, and landing zone, up to the Instrument and/or Visual
   Flight Rule (VFR) hold lines and within 100 feet of runway/overruns/landing zone edge (see
   Attachment 2 for airfield diagram). McChord Tower controls all vehicles/aircraft crossing
   or operating on the CMA and shares responsibility for the safety of personnel in these areas.
   Vehicles and pedestrians will not operate on any part of the CMA without direct two-way
   radio communication, clearance, and approval from Tower. Aircraft or vehicle movement
   within the loading, maintenance, or parking areas is the responsibility of the pilot,
   aircraft/vehicle operator, or AMOPS. Tower Ground Control will advise aircraft taxiing
   from parking areas about other aircraft and vehicles on the movement area which may be a
   factor. Rules for vehicles operating on the airfield are contained in 62 AWI 13-201. If radio
   communication with a vehicle or pedestrian on the aircraft movement area is lost, the control
   tower will flash the runway/taxiway lights. Vehicles or pedestrian will immediately depart
   the CMA. Vehicles and personnel must withdraw to a point no less than 100 feet from the
   edge of the runway, LZ, and overruns when directed by Tower to "exit the runway or
   taxiway."
      2.1.1.1. Fire Department and medical response vehicles responding to Tower’s primary
      crash alarm system activation require Tower approval to operate in the CMA.. Tower
      will monitor the crash net until all emergency response vehicles have exited the
      movement area.
      2.1.1.2. Fire Department and medical response vehicles responding to airfield
      emergencies will notify Tower and AMOPS that they are responding.
      2.1.1.3. When Security Forces personnel or vehicles require access on the CMA,
      Security Forces will contact Tower via the tower net for approval.
   2.1.2. Aircraft, vehicles, and pedestrians unable to comply with the requirements listed
   above may obtain individual clearance by prior coordination with AMOPS. AMOPS
   coordinates such requests with Tower. As a minimum, vehicles operating on the runway are
   escorted by trained personnel who are in continuous radio contact with Tower.
   2.1.3. Aircraft repositioning (including towing) on the airfield must have Tower clearance
   before moving and must remain in radio contact during movement. NOTE: When advised
   by Tower during periods of reduced visibility, where potential conflict between
   towing/taxiing aircraft cannot be discerned from Tower, crews will provide Tower with
   progressive movement information and turn on aircraft navigation lights when available.
   Tower provides advisories of known towing/taxiing conflicts to crews and provides an
   alternate route.
   2.1.4. CMA incursions observed by Tower are reported to AMOPS via landline as soon as
   all potential conflicts have been resolved. The Airfield Manager reports all movement area
   incursions to the Airfield Operations Flight (AOF) Commander.
62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                         15


       2.1.4.1. For runway incursions that had an adverse impact on flight operations, an AF
       IMT 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report, will be submitted to Wing Safety.
       2.1.4.2. For specific incidents of runway incursions and other CMA violations that did
       not impact aircraft operations, AF IMT 457, USAF Hazard Report, will be completed and
       forwarded to Wing Safety, with an information copy to the Airfield Manager.
2.2. Precision Approach Critical Areas. The localizer and glide slope critical areas for
runway 16/34, and the CAT II touchdown area for runway 34 are depicted in Attachment 2.
These areas will be protected IAW FAA and AF directives any time precision instrument
approaches are in progress. The localizer and glide slope critical areas for runway 34 conform to
FAA criteria; the runway 34 CAT II touchdown area conforms to AF criteria. The localizer and
glide slope critical areas for runway 16 conform solely to AF criteria. Vehicles will not enter the
ILS Critical Areas without Tower approval IAW 62 AWI 13-201. Vehicle/Aircraft operations in
or through the ILS critical areas (Attachment 2) are subject to the following conditions:
   2.2.1. Localizer Critical Area for Runway 16: When weather conditions are below an 800-
   foot ceiling or 2-miles visibility, do not authorize vehicle/aircraft operations in or over the
   critical area when an aircraft conducting an ILS approach is inside the FAF.
   2.2.2. Glide Slope Critical Area. When weather is below an 800-foot ceiling or 2-miles
   visibility, do not authorize aircraft larger than fighter type to operate beyond the instrument
   hold line (runway 34) or to taxi/move beyond the instrument hold line on the east side of
   Taxiway Bravo (runway 16) when an aircraft conducting an ILS approach is inside the FAF.

   NOTE 1: Parking spot K-2 is located inside the runway 16 glide slope critical area. Use of
   K-2 must be restricted when runway 16 is in use and can only be used if approved by the
   Airfield Manager or a higher authority.

   NOTE 2: Combat offloads on Bravo East are conducted within the glide slope area.
   2.2.3. CAT II Touchdown Critical Area. When CAT II operations are in effect and the
   reported ceiling is less than 200 feet or the RVR is 2,000 or less, do not allow vehicles or
   aircraft to violate the touchdown critical area. Tower will instruct aircraft taxiing to RWY 34
   via Taxiway Echo and aircraft taxiing from Taxiway Bravo east of the runway to “HOLD
   SHORT OF (runway) ILS CRITICAL AREA."
2.3. Ground Engine Runs:
   2.3.1. Maintenance engine runs will be conducted IAW McChord AFBI 21-3, Ramp
   Operations Procedures. In addition to instructions outlined in that instruction, Maintenance
   Operations Center (MOC) will maintain a log of the aircraft tail number, location, estimated
   start time, duration, purpose and name of person providing the information for review by the
   62 AW Commander and Public Affairs when needed.
   2.3.2. No engine runs above idle are authorized anywhere on the airfield between 2300L and
   0500L , without 62 MXG Commander and MOC coordination. This restriction is waived
   during exercise and contingency operations.
   2.3.3. Prior to engine runs, MOC will advise Tower of the aircraft tail number, location,
   number of engines to be run, and whether it is an idle or power run. Maintenance personnel
 16                                                             62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011


   must monitor ground control frequency during engine runs. NOTE: In the interest of safety
   or due to excessive noise, Tower may instruct any aircraft, on any spot, running at power to
   return to idle immediately. A return to idle will be accomplished without delay. Tower can
   also terminate engine runs at any time. Maintenance will be advised when runs may be
   resumed.
   2.3.4. The following procedures are implemented between Tower and MOC to reduce
   engine noise in close proximity of the tower. These procedures are necessary for safe air
   traffic control operations and are in effect 24 hours a day. The MOC is responsible for
   ensuring that the following procedures are adhered to:
       2.3.4.1. D-25 is authorized for idle and below. Maximum power engine runs on parking
       spot D-26 through D-31 are restricted as follows:
       2.3.4.2. For C-17 aircraft only:
          2.3.4.2.1. Maximum power engine runs on spots D-26 through D-29 are authorized.
          2.3.4.2.2. Maximum power engine runs on D-30 and D-31 are authorized provided
          approval is granted by the control tower watch supervisor and close coordination is
          maintained with Tower prior to and during above idle runs. NOTE: Maximum
          power engine runs on D-31 are authorized provided that a return to idle power is
          accomplished before aircraft taxiing on Hotel (north-south) are affected.
   2.3.5. Maximum power engine runs on parking spots B-6 and B-8 are authorized provided:
       2.3.5.1. Approval is granted by the tower watch supervisor and close coordination is
       maintained with Tower prior to and during above idle runs.
       2.3.5.2. A return to idle is accomplished if there are aircraft taxiing on Hotel (north-
       south) that are affected.
   2.3.6. Maximum power engine runs on parking spots J-6, J-9, J-12, and J-15 are authorized
   provided:
       2.3.6.1. Approval is granted by the tower watch supervisor and close coordination is
       maintained with Tower prior to and during above idle runs.
       2.3.6.2. A return to idle is accomplished if there are aircraft taxiing on Hotel (north-
       south) that are affected.
2.4. Local Aircraft Radio Channelization. Pilots and ATC may substitute and use radio
channels for radio frequencies. The channels and frequencies listed below may be used in radio
communications with 62 AW aircraft:

Table 2.1. Local Aircraft Radio Channelization.

62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                      17


2.5. Departure Clearances/Procedures:
   2.5.1. All aircrews shall have an IFR/VFR flight plan on file with AMOPS prior to engine
   start requests. If expected departure is more than 30 minutes prior to filed departure time,
   pilots should advise Ground Control on initial contact of the new departure time (this will
   facilitate update of the ATC computer system). NOTE: If expected departure is more than
   90 minutes after the filed departure time, pilots should advise Ground Control as soon as
   possible. This will allow ATC to keep the flight plan open.
   2.5.2. Aircrews shall notify Pilot to Dispatch (PTD) anytime they plan on delaying in the
   local IFR/VFR pattern on a separate clearance that has not been filed (i.e.,
   TCM…SPAAN…TCM) prior to departing on their previously filed IFR flight plan.
   2.5.3. Pilots requesting opposite direction departures will notify Ground Control of the
   request on initial contact (aircrews should expect delays or non-approval). NOTE: Due to
   rapidly changing air traffic situations, Tower will coordinate opposite direction IFR
   departures no earlier than 10 minutes prior to departure time.
   2.5.4. At ATC or pilot request, aircraft may make intersection takeoffs (see Attachment 2
   for feet available). Exception: Aircraft will not takeoff to the north from the Taxiway Bravo
   intersection.
   2.5.5. IFR departure procedures.
      2.5.5.1. Aircraft departing McChord IFR into the National Airspace System (NAS) can
      expect one of three departure procedures: the Olympic-X, Alder-X or Puget-X. These
      departure procedures are located in the Low Altitude DOD Flight Information
      Publication, Vol 1. Aircraft departing south, southeast or westbound may file for the
      Alder-X departure procedure. McChord Tower will issue the appropriate departure
      procedure as shown on the flight plan (Olympic-X departure, if a procedure was not
      filed). Tower will issue an initial altitude IAW Seattle TRACON-TCM letter of
      agreement. In the event of a VORTAC/VOR/TACAN outage, aircrews can expect radar
      vectors from Seattle TRACON.
      2.5.5.2. Aircraft departing IFR into the local radar pattern for multiple approaches will
      be issued the Puget-X departure and an initial altitude of 3,000’.
   2.5.6. Active Air Scramble Procedures. Active Air Scramble procedures are executed
   between Western Air Defense Sector, Seattle TRACON, McChord ATC Tower, and Det 1,
   194th Regional Support Wing (ANG).
2.6. Heavy Aircraft Taxiway/Parking Restrictions:
   2.6.1. Taxiways.
      2.6.1.1. Taxiways Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Echo, and Juliet are available for use by all
      aircraft. Due to the potential FOD hazard, C-5 and 747/E-4 aircraft may use Taxiway
      Delta only if absolutely necessary.
      2.6.1.2. Taxiway Foxtrot is used only during daytime/VFR conditions unless portable
      taxiway lights are installed and at the lowest possible aircraft gross weights. (C-130
      limit: 165,000 lbs.) Questions concerning other aircraft types are referred to AMOPS
      (DSN 382-5611).
 18                                                               62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011


      2.6.1.3. Heavy aircraft shall be restricted from utilizing Taxiway Hotel south of Taxiway
      Delta when the RCR on Hotel is reported as 4 or less.
   2.6.2. Ramps.
      2.6.2.1. Bravo Ramp and Kilo parking spots are available for C-5 and 747/E-4
      operations. NOTE: Delta Ramp and Juliet Ramp may be used with Airfield
      Management approval.
      2.6.2.2. Aircraft Parking. Heavy aircraft parking procedures shall be IAW McChord
      AFBI 21-3. Aircraft parked on K-2 are positioned with the nose wheel on the parking
      spot and the front of the aircraft pointed toward the runway. NOTE: Parking spot K-2 is
      located inside the runway 16 glide slope critical area. Use of K-2 shall be restricted when
      runway 16 is in use and can only be used if approved by the Airfield Manager or a higher
      authority.
      2.6.2.3. Transient aircraft parking on the Delta Extension (directly east of the tower) will
      utilize D40 – D43 and will taxi in/out via the southern taxilane. This will prevent aircraft
      from taxiing over the red carpet on DV2.
2.7. Armed Ordnance Ground Procedures. Any aircraft with an armed gun or live missiles is
considered HOT loaded.
   2.7.1. Tower and pilots are not restricted from taxiing aircraft in front of HOT loaded
   aircraft holding short of the runway.
   2.7.2. Pilots will notify Tower anytime actual arming/de-arming is taking place. Tower will
   restrict aircraft from taxiing directly in front of the aircraft being armed/de-armed.
   2.7.3. Flight lead will notify Tower when the flight/aircraft begins arming/de-arming and
   when the procedure is complete.
   2.7.4. Notification is not required for arming/de-arming on the south hammerhead as long as
   aircraft are being armed/de-armed in the south arming area, heading southeast. Arm/de-arm
   operations may be conducted in either hammerhead (Taxiway Alpha or Echo) and primary
   parking for armed aircraft is located on the Lima Pad.
2.8. Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC) Locations:
   2.8.1. Primary: Inbound aircraft will taxi to Charlie Ramp ERCC #2 (single ship).
   Formation aircraft will taxi to Charlie Ramp ERCC #1, #2, #3 (as required). Aircrews will
   taxi via the concrete taxilane to the ERCC locations (middle portion of Charlie Ramp is not
   stressed for C-17 operations). Outbound aircrews will taxi to the active runway via Taxiway
   Juliet (Taxiway Kilo taxi operations require 62 OG/CC approval and will not normally be
   approved).
   2.8.2. Secondary: As directed by Command Post.
2.9. Chaff/Flare Aircraft Parking. IAW AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety Standards, aircraft
configured with Aerial Defense Systems can be parked on any aircraft parking spot.
62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                        19

                                 AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL

3.1. Local Flying Area. The following local flying area is established to facilitate required
activities (Attachment 4).
   3.1.1. Local flying area - area enclosed with the following boundaries:
       3.1.1.1. North boundary - United States/Canadian border.
       3.1.1.2. East boundary - 115 degrees W. longitude.
       3.1.1.3. South boundary - 42 degrees N. latitude.
       3.1.1.4. West boundary - Pacific Air Defense Information Zone (ADIZ).
   3.1.2. Aerobatic area - area enclosed within the following boundaries:
       3.1.2.1. North boundary - 48 degrees 00' N. latitude.
       3.1.2.2. East boundary - 123 degrees 45' W. longitude.
       3.1.2.3. South boundary - 47 degrees 08' N. latitude.
       3.1.2.4. West boundary - Pacific Ocean shoreline.
3.2. Functional Check Flight Route. The functional check flight route should be filed as a
point-to-point flight plan on a DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan.
3.3. Operations within Class Delta Airspace. Aircraft in the Class D airspace will monitor
Tower frequency except when under the control of Seattle Approach Control.
3.4. Civil Aircraft Use:
   3.4.1. Civil aircraft are not permitted to land at McChord Field except as permitted by AFI
   10-1001, Civil Aircraft Landing Permits, and AFI 10-1002, Agreements for Civil Aircraft
   Use of Air Force Airfields. For civil aircraft landings, a DD Form 2401, Civil Aircraft
   Landing Permit, must be executed and on file in AMOPS, or the pilot must have declared an
   in-flight emergency.
   3.4.2. Civil aircraft may make practice instrument approaches providing traffic density
   permits. These approaches must not degrade mission or training requirements of military
   aircraft. Practice approaches are low approaches only unless specifically approved in
   writing.
3.5. VFR Traffic Patterns:
   3.5.1. Standard traffic patterns are left traffic for runway 16 and right traffic for runway 34
   (East). Left traffic to runway 34, right traffic to runway 16 (West) may be conducted with
   ATC approval for traffic purposes or aircraft operational need. NOTE: Left traffic to
   runway 16 may turn crosswind upon reaching 1,000’ AGL and south of Spanaway Lake.
   3.5.2. Rectangular patterns are flown at 1,800 feet MSL with entry to the downwind at an
   angle of 45 degrees or as directed by ATC. Downwind leg is flown over Pacific Avenue or
 20                                                                   62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011


   as directed/approved by Tower.       NOTE:      Begin the base turn to runway 34 south of
   Spanaway Lake.
   3.5.3. Overhead pattern is flown at 2,300 feet MSL (aircraft may not fly the overhead pattern
   at 1,800 feet MSL due to noise abatement). Approach control shall vector aircraft no closer
   than 6 mile initial. Tower will instruct VFR aircraft where to report initial. NOTE: If
   traffic dictates, Tower may instruct aircraft to ―Re-enter initial.‖
       3.5.3.1. Initial Re-Entry will be flown on a 3-5 mile arc to the east of the runway. Tower
       will instruct aircraft where to report initial, normally 3-5 mile initial (traffic conditions
       may dictate that aircraft extend initial beyond 5 miles).
       3.5.3.2. ―Tactical Initial‖ is not authorized at McChord.
   3.5.4. Closed Traffic patterns are flown at 2,300 feet MSL for fighter-type aircraft and 1,800
   feet MSL for all other aircraft.
       3.5.4.1. Begin the turn to crosswind after passing departure end of the runway.
       3.5.4.2. When Tower states, "closed traffic approved," it means fly the local procedures
       and execute closed traffic. If Tower wants an aircraft to turn crosswind prior to departure
       end, Tower will state: "present position closed traffic approved." NOTE: The pilot is
       still authorized to execute a normal crosswind turn, and, if unable to execute an early
       crosswind turn, will advise Tower.
       3.5.4.3. Runway 16: Aircraft delaying the turn to crosswind more than 1 NM south of
       the field boundary should be alert to the Spanaway Airport traffic area. Spanaway
       Airport’s delegated airspace is up to and including 1000’ MSL to the southeast. Aircraft
       operating in this area are not required to maintain radio communication with McChord
       Tower.
   3.5.5. Patterns must avoid Restricted Area R6703, located approximately 7 nautical miles
   (NM) southwest of McChord, unless authorized by Approach Control.
3.6. Weather Minimums for VFR Patterns:
   3.6.1. Ceiling shall be at least 500’ above the appropriate pattern altitude.
   3.6.2. Ground visibility shall be at least 3 statute miles (SM).
   3.6.3. Anytime weather conditions limit a controller's ability to maintain visual contact with
   an aircraft, the watch supervisor will close the appropriate pattern regardless of the reported
   weather until he/she determines the weather condition causing the sight limitation is no
   longer a factor.
3.7. Radar Traffic Patterns. Seattle Approach Control has control over McChord’s Radar
Traffic Pattern. Patterns will be flown east of the runway at 3,000’ MSL. Seattle Approach will
determine the length of each leg of the pattern on a real-time basis.
3.8. Protection of 360 Overhead. During VFR conditions, aircraft making normal takeoffs,
low approaches, touch-and-go landings, stop-and-go landings, or missed approaches will not
climb above 1,800 feet MSL until the departure end of the runway. When the 360 overhead
pattern is in use, Tower shall issue the following to all IFR departing aircraft: “(ACID) on
62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                       21


departure cross departure end at or below 1,800 feet, overhead in use.” The 1,800-foot MSL
restriction provides 500 feet separation from the 360 overhead traffic pattern.
3.9. Departure Priorities. Tower and Approach Control may delay, vector, hold, or breakout
local traffic and any traffic making a practice approach to facilitate "ACTIVE AIR DEFENSE
MISSION/SCRAMBLE," ―PRIORITY,‖ and ―TIME CRITICAL‖ departures. IAW FAAO
7110.65, departure time is considered the time the aircraft becomes airborne. NOTE: Aircraft
in distress have the right of way over all other aircraft.
   3.9.1. In addition to priorities in FAAO 7110.65, and AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures
   for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials, priorities for departures are:
       3.9.1.1. First priority is an Active Air Defense Mission/Scramble.
       3.9.1.2. Second priority is an air evacuation aircraft requesting priority.
       3.9.1.3. Third priority is AMC-scheduled time-critical missions. When required, CP will
       contact Tower and advise, “(Call-sign) is TIME CRITICAL at (time).” Aircrews should
       be prepared to takeoff on either runway. Crews may request an opposite direction
       departure if insufficient time exists to taxi to the primary runway. Tower will coordinate
       with Approach Control as necessary. Time-critical departures are considered on time
       when the aircraft departs not later than 2 minutes after the declared ―TIME CRITICAL‖
       time. NOTE: If pilots insist on an opposite direction departure, additional delays may
       be incurred due to traffic. Based on current traffic in the local pattern and traffic
       controlled by Approach Control, departing from the runway in use might be more
       expeditious.
       3.9.1.4. Fourth priority is Priority Departures. Priority departures are normally given to
       airdrop and air refueling missions whose delay could affect mission accomplishment. To
       initiate this priority, pilots will request ―PRIORITY DEPARTURE‖ with a specific
       departure time when placing clearance on request. If there is an anticipated delay, Tower
       will coordinate with Approach Control to ensure departure as close to the priority time as
       possible. If the reason for requiring a priority takeoff becomes invalid, the pilot will
       cancel the priority request. Priority departures are considered on time when the aircraft
       departs at the declared ―PRIORITY DEPARTURE‖ time.

       NOTE 1: Tower will make every effort to facilitate on-time departures based on traffic
       (current and expected), runway in use, and IAW all current AF and FAA directives.
       Aircrews should make every effort to keep Tower informed of changes, delays, etc., at
       the earliest possible opportunity.

       NOTE 2: CP will advise Tower which AMC aircraft has precedence if a conflict arises
       between two or more time-critical or priority mission departures.
       3.9.1.5. Fifth priority is a Distinguished Visitor (DV) aircraft.
          3.9.1.5.1. AMOPS will notify Tower of all known aircraft requiring DV handling.
          3.9.1.5.2. Tower will notify CP when an arriving DV aircraft is 10 miles from the
          runway.
 22                                                               62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011


       3.9.1.6. Sixth priority is Practice Air Defense Mission/Scramble.
       3.9.1.7. Seventh priority is C-17 demonstration flights.
   3.9.2. To expedite traffic flow, Tower may ask aircraft awaiting departure if they can
   expedite takeoff. This means aircraft, other than heavy jets, will move from position on the
   taxiway/run-up area onto the runway and start takeoff roll without stopping. A clearance to
   expedite takeoff for a heavy jet indicates the aircraft will move from its position on the
   taxiway/run-up area onto the runway, STOP, and then begin takeoff roll as soon as possible.
   ATC cannot issue a clearance that implies or indicates approval of rolling takeoffs by heavy
   aircraft. Any aircraft unable to comply with the ATC request will respond with, ―Unable to
   expedite takeoff.‖
   3.9.3. Inquiries pertaining to alleged ATC delays are immediately addressed to the Airfield
   Operations Flight Commander or Chief Controller who will investigate and determine if the
   air traffic system caused the delay.
3.10. Formation Flights. Formation takeoffs and landings are authorized and are governed by
aircraft operating procedures and command directives.
   3.10.1. Two or more aircraft constitute a nonstandard formation for locally based C-17
   aircraft. Lead pilots will inform the Tower of any exceptions.
   3.10.2. Tower shall instruct the last aircraft in a nonstandard formation flight to squawk
   1100.
3.11. Opposite-Direction Traffic. McChord Tower or Seattle Approach Control will
approve/disapprove opposite-direction operations based on existing/proposed traffic, priority
requirements, and noise abatement concerns. NOTE: All communication regarding opposite-
direction operations must include the phrase "OPPOSITE DIRECTION DEPARTURE OR
ARRIVAL (as appropriate), RUNWAY (number)."
   3.11.1. Tower shall coordinate opposite-direction departures with Seattle Approach Control
   no earlier than 10 minutes prior to departure.
       3.11.1.1. Unless otherwise coordinated, Tower shall not clear an opposite-direction
       departure for takeoff after an arrival is 10 miles on final approach.
       3.11.1.2. Unless otherwise coordinated, Tower shall not clear a departure for takeoff
       after an opposite-direction arrival is 10 miles on final approach.
   3.11.2. Approach Control shall coordinate opposite-direction arrival approaches with Tower
   as needed.
       3.11.2.1. Approach Control shall not allow an opposite-direction arrival to proceed
       closer than the FAF until an arrival to the runway in use has landed or turned to a heading
       to avoid conflict.
       3.11.2.2. Approach Control shall not allow an arrival to proceed closer than the FAF
       until an opposite-direction arrival has landed or turned to a heading to avoid conflict.
3.12. Restricted Low Approaches. When personnel or equipment are on or operating within
100 feet of the runway, Tower may authorize restricted low approaches at or above 900 feet
62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                       23


MSL (500 feet AGL) to include locally assigned heavy aircraft. Transient heavy aircraft will be
assigned 1,400 feet MSL (1,000 feet AGL).
3.13. Standard Go-Around/Missed Approach Procedures. In the event an aircraft has to
execute an unplanned go-around/missed approach, Tower shall issue the following instructions:
   3.13.1. When the tower VFR traffic pattern is open, tower shall instruct aircraft to remain in
   the closed traffic pattern and issue appropriate direction of turns and altitude.
   3.13.2. When the tower VFR traffic pattern is closed, Tower shall issue the following
   clearance: "Fly runway heading, climb and maintain 2,000 feet. Contact departure on
   (frequency)." NOTE: Tower will immediately inform Approach Control of all unplanned
   go-around/missed approaches to include instructions issued/pilot's intentions.
3.14. Circling Procedures:
   3.14.1. Circling approaches are available to runway 34. All circling approaches will be
   flown to the west of the runway. Runway 34 circle to 16 operations are authorized for
   operational necessity only and must terminate in a full-stop. NOTE: An "operational
   necessity" is based on aircraft emergencies, weather conditions, availability of NAVAIDS,
   etc. Aircrew training requirements do not qualify as an operational necessity.
   3.14.2. 360-degree circling maneuvers (i.e. approach to 34 circle to 34) are authorized on
   runway 34 to the west only.
   3.14.3. Approach to 16, circle to 34 procedures will have ground track east of I-5 and south
   of Highway 512.
   3.14.4. Approach to 34, circle to 16 procedures will have ground track crossing over I-5 and
   Highway 512.
3.15. Multiple Approach Procedures. Aircraft conducting multiple IFR approaches or
requesting radar service from the VFR closed traffic pattern shall be issued the following climb-
out instructions: Puget X Departures; maintain 3,000. When necessary, alternate instructions
may be issued after coordination with approach control.
3.16. Noise Abatement. In the interest of community relations, the following procedures will
apply.
   3.16.1. After takeoff, all aircraft will achieve the appropriate rate of climb, commensurate
   with safety, to assure minimum noise level over populated areas.
   3.16.2. When possible, pilots should avoid over-flight of the Brown’s Point and Downtown
   Tacoma areas. Our policy is to use runway 34 as the primary landing runway unless safety
   or operational requirements dictate otherwise. NOTE: When on radar vectors for a runway
   16 approach, aircrews should query Seattle Approach Control about extended vectors that
   would impact Brown’s Point and Downtown Tacoma. Additionally, conditions permitting
   (i.e., good weather, experienced crew levels), aircrews should request "short vectors."
   3.16.3. During non-precision approaches to runway 16, do not descend to minimum descent
   altitude so early that prolonged use of high-power settings at low altitudes are used.
   3.16.4. Avoid over-flying the church located approximately 500 feet east of Pacific Avenue
   midfield downwind and Pacific Lutheran University.
 24                                                                62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011


   3.16.5. Avoid Eatonville and Swanson Field by 3 NM and 3,000 feet.
   3.16.6. Safety should never be compromised, but arrivals and departures should be planned
   with these noise-sensitive areas in mind.
3.17. Separation (VFR - VFR, VFR - IFR). Tower uses separation criteria IAW FAAO
7110.65 for all aircraft.
3.18. Reduced Same Runway Separation (RSRS). McChord tower controllers are authorized
to use minimum standards (para 3.18.8.) between McChord-assigned aircraft. Minimum
standards may also be applied between McChord-assigned aircraft and other aircraft assigned to
AMC, ACC, AETC, ANG, AFMC, AFRC, and AFSOC. Air traffic controllers must be able to
see all aircraft involved and determine distances by reference to suitable landmarks. If any doubt
exists, tower controllers must revert to FAAO 7110.65 separation standards.
   3.18.1. Any aircrew or tower controller may refuse RSRS when safety of flight may be
   jeopardized. In these cases, apply appropriate separation standards published in FAAO
   7110.65.
   3.18.2. Aircraft will not overfly aircraft on the runway. Responsibility for separation rests
   with the pilot. Controllers must provide appropriate traffic advisories to landing aircraft.
   3.18.3. Controllers will provide cautionary wake turbulence advisories when required IAW
   FAAO 7110.65; however; pilots are responsible for wake turbulence separation when
   maintaining visual separation or operating under VFR. When operating IFR or under ATC
   instructions, air traffic controllers must ensure standard wake turbulence separation exists.
   3.18.4. For fighter-type aircraft only: A low approach following a full stop shall use the
   alternate side of the runway when passing the aircraft on landing roll. Aircraft will not over-
   fly aircraft on the runway. Responsibility for separation rests with the pilot. Controllers will
   provide appropriate traffic advisories to aircraft involved.
   3.18.5. RSRS between standard formation aircraft full stops are authorized provided aircraft
   involved are the same type aircraft. Separation is measured between the trailing aircraft in
   the lead formation and the lead aircraft in the trailing formation.
   3.18.6. RSRS is not authorized:
       3.18.6.1. During any situation involving an emergency aircraft.
       3.18.6.2. During any situation where the lead aircraft is ―cleared for the option‖ or ―stop
       and go.‖
       3.18.6.3. During any situation involving an aircraft ―low approach‖ behind a ―touch-and-
       go‖ aircraft.
       3.18.6.4. During any situation involving an aircraft ―touch-and-go‖ behind a ―full-stop.‖
       3.18.6.5. Between sunset and sunrise (night).
       3.18.6.6. Anytime the runway surface condition is reported as wet, ice on runway, snow
       on runway, or breaking action is reported as ―fair,‖ ―poor, ‖ or ―nil‖ by any aircraft or by
       AMOPS.
62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                         25


       3.18.6.7. With aircraft assigned to MAJCOMs not designated in this instruction unless a
       letter of agreement (LOA) is signed between owning MAJCOM/DO and the AMC/A3.
   3.18.7. When applying RSRS standards, ―same aircraft‖ means same airframe (i.e., H/C-17
   behind H/C-17, F-15 behind F-15, T-38 behind T-38/AT-38, C-130 behind MC-130, etc.).
   All other fighter- and trainer-type operations means not the same airframe (i.e., F-15 behind
   F-16, F-16 behind F-18, T-38 behind T-37, etc.).
   3.18.8. RSRS Standards:

Table 3.1. RSRS Standards.




3.19. B-52 Aircraft Restrictions. Except in an emergency, B-52 aircraft are not permitted to
land due to a lack of outrigger clearance from the BAK-12 housings. B-52 low approaches are
permitted. Tower will ensure pilots are notified of the BAK-12 housing limitations prior to
starting the approach.
3.20. Armed Ordnance Recovery Procedures. HOT loaded aircraft will recover via normal
traffic routes to the active runway. There are no restrictions placed on number of practice traffic
patterns or instrument approaches flown by armed aircraft.
3.21. Wind Variability:
   3.21.1. The 62 OG/CC has determined that controllers shall issue variable wind information
   IAW AFI 13-204, Vol 3.
   3.21.2. Controllers will issue variable wind information when there are changes in wind
   direction of 60 degrees or more when the wind speed is 6 knots or more.
3.22. Communications Outage Procedures. In the event of an aircraft or tower
communications failure, procedures will be conducted IAW the Aeronautical Information
Manual, FAAO 7110.65, and the following procedures:
26                                                               62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011


  3.22.1. If the tower has a complete communications failure, all aircraft will deconflict
  themselves and monitor the tower for light gun signals. Locally-assigned aircraft will make
  full-stop landings. Transient aircraft will depart the Class Delta airspace and contact Seattle
  Approach Control for clearance to an alternate location.
  3.22.2. If an aircraft loses communication with the tower, the aircraft will monitor the
  control tower for a light gun signal and expect to make a full-stop landing.
62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                        27

   4.3.17. Det 1, 194 RSW (ANG).
4.4. Hot Brakes Procedures:
   4.4.1. Hot brakes emergency parking areas are the hammerheads on each end of the runway
   and as remote from other aircraft as possible.
   4.4.2. Taxi to the hot brake area via a route requiring the least amount of taxiing.
   4.4.3. Non-essential personnel will remain at least 300 feet from the aircraft until approved
   by Fire Department personnel.
   4.4.4. Pilots will follow directions of Fire Department and Aircraft Maintenance personnel.
4.5. Hung Flare Procedures:
   4.5.1. When a hung flare condition is suspected in-flight, the aircrew will declare an in-flight
   emergency.
      4.5.1.1. Aircrews will avoid bringing the aircraft to a full stop anywhere on the ramp that
      might block the normal taxi flow. Lima pad will be used for parking if available.
      4.5.1.2. One crewmember will deplane to check for an actual hung flare.
      4.5.1.3. If a hung flare is detected, the crew will shut down and evacuate the aircraft.
      4.5.1.4. A 600-foot cordon will be established around the aircraft.
   4.5.2. If a hung flare is discovered during the ground inspection and an in-flight emergency
   was not previously declared, the crew will declare a ground emergency with Ground Control.
      4.5.2.1. The crew will shut down and evacuate the aircraft.
      4.5.2.2. A 600-foot cordon will be established around the aircraft.
4.6. Hung Ordnance Procedures:
   4.6.1. Runway 34 is the runway of choice.
   4.6.2. Airborne aircraft will request vectors for an approach which avoids populated areas to
   the maximum extent possible.
   4.6.3. After landing, aircraft will make turns on the runway toward the east.
 30                                                                  62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011


   4.6.4. Position the aircraft in the primary (parking spot F-40) or secondary hung ordnance
   area as directed by Tower or EOD on magnetic heading 145 degrees and follow directions of
   weapons personnel.
   4.6.5. If an arresting cable engagement is required, EOD/weapons personnel will be
   available at the scene to "safe" the aircraft when approved by the Fire Department.
   4.6.6. Monitor Ground Control frequency while following the directions of EOD/weapons
   personnel.
   4.6.7. Keep Ground Control apprised of the situation.
4.7. Gun Malfunction Procedures:
   4.7.1. Landing Runway 34: Tower will direct aircraft to F-40, parked towards the gun berm
   or make a 180-degree turn to the east and back taxi to the south de-arm area. If unable to
   back taxi, position the aircraft in the north de-arm area, pointing southeast, and await
   EOD/weapons personnel.
   4.7.2. Landing Runway 16: Proceed directly to F-40, parked towards the gun berm or to the
   end of the runway, face south and wait for EOD/weapons personnel.
   4.7.3. Monitor Ground Control frequency while following the directions of EOD/weapons
   personnel.
   4.7.4. Keep Ground Control apprised of the situation.
4.8. Hydrazine Procedures. If an aircraft reports having activated its Emergency Power Unit
(EPU) in-flight, after landing Tower will instruct the pilot to taxi the aircraft to parking spot F-40
and advise the pilot to position the aircraft with the EPU side of the fuselage downwind. NOTE:
Some pilots may not want to taxi with a hydrazine leak due to the possibility of contamination.
Make every effort to direct them to F-40 via the most direct route to avoid affecting additional
areas.
   4.8.1. If spot F-40 is not available, the tower will coordinate with Fire Department to park
   the aircraft as far away from other aircraft, structures, and personnel as possible.
   4.8.2. Fire Department will escort the aircraft if necessary and Tower will provide
   progressive taxi instructions to aid the aircraft.
   4.8.3. The Incident Commander will notify Tower of all emergency terminations.
       4.8.3.1. Tower will notify AMOPS of ground/in-flight emergency termination times.
       4.8.3.2. Tower will notify Seattle Approach of all in-flight emergency termination times.
4.9. Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT)/Crash Position Indicator (CPI) Signals. All
ELT/CPI signals are considered an emergency until the source is located and proven otherwise.
NOTE: The first 5 minutes of each hour are designated for ELT testing, which is an alarm not
exceeding three audio sweeps. To preclude degradation of the system, the following procedures
are established when a signal is received and no supporting data is available:
   4.9.1. Tower will notify AMOPS.
   4.9.2. AMOPS notifies Life Support and MOC.
62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                       31


   4.9.3. MOC determines the source of the signal and silences the active locator beacon. If
   unable to locate the beacon on McChord, MOC notifies AMOPS and provides known data,
   i.e., frequency, signal strength, bearing from McChord, etc.
   4.9.4. AMOPS passes the data to Tower.
   4.9.5. Tower notifies Seattle Center Watch Supervisor with all known ELT/CPI data via the
   ―FLOW‖ dial line 03.
   4.9.6. Tower notifies AMOPS and Seattle Center Watch Supervisor of all emergency and
   ELT/CPI terminations.
4.10. Fuel Tank, Ordnance, Cargo Jettison, and Fuel Dumping (Attachment 5). A portion
of Restricted Area R6703 is established as the jettison area for external fuel tanks and
conventional ordnance. The area is approximately 195 degrees/10 DME from the McChord
VORTAC. However, the designated impact area is relatively small (4-3/4 by 2-3/8 miles) and
the drop should be made as accurately as possible. NOTE: Anyone having knowledge of a
planned fuel tank, ordnance, or cargo jettison will contact the Range Control Officer (RCO) at
Fort Lewis (253-967-6371 or on VHF 141.125) as soon as possible with the pertinent details.
The RCO, in turn, will ensure the restricted/jettison areas are sterilized.
   4.10.1. Seattle Approach Control will notify the RCO when an emergency drop is
   contemplated. Approach Control may be contacted for vectors to the emergency drop when
   an aircraft is unable to proceed VFR or upon request.
   4.10.2. Aircraft will approach the jettison area at 2,000 feet MSL on a southwesterly heading
   (see Attachment 4). An alternate jettison area for cargo, fuel tanks, and ordnance is the
   Pacific Ocean while the aircraft is under the control of Seattle Center. An aircraft requiring
   internal fuel jettison normally is vectored to an over-water area. Fuel may be released
   anytime above 5,000 feet AGL. Pilots will notify the appropriate ATC facility prior to fuel
   release.
   4.10.3. McChord does not have a designated fuel dumping area. When fuel dumping is
   required, Seattle Approach or Seattle Center will designate a location.
4.11. Controlled Bailouts:
   4.11.1. The controlled bailout area is the landing zone at the McChord 150/08 mile fix.
   Aircraft should approach the controlled bailout area at 2,500 feet MSL (fighters use 5,000
   feet MSL) heading 270 degrees. This should cause the aircraft to impact within Restricted
   Area R6703.
   4.11.2. During communications failure, pilots should set transponders to code 7700, fly to
   the McChord TACAN, and proceed outbound on the 150-degree radial at 2,500 feet MSL
   (fighters use 5,000 feet). When over the 8 DME fix, turn to heading 270 degrees and bailout.
   4.11.3. Anyone having knowledge of a planned bailout will contact the RCO at Fort Lewis
   (253-967-6371 or on VHF 141.125) as soon as possible with the pertinent details. The RCO,
   in turn, will ensure the restricted/controlled bailout areas are sterilized.
4.12. Anti-Hijacking Procedures. Anti-hijack procedures are outlined in FAAO 7110.65, Air
Traffic Control, AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (FOUO), and JO 7610.4,
Special Operations.
32                                                            62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011


  4.12.1. CP will notify Tower and AMOPS to initiate anti-hijack procedures if the situation
  has not already been identified by Tower or other agencies.
  4.12.2. Tower will:
     4.12.2.1. Monitor ground activities. Ensure all engine starts, taxi, towing, and takeoff
     information is received through the authorized agency (AMOPS, MOC, or CP). The
     daily flying schedule is published by CP and may be used to identify authorized engine
     starts. Flying schedule must be obtained via a verified source.
     4.12.2.2. Obtain and document parking location on all engine running aircraft and the
     origin and destination of all aircraft in tow.
     4.12.2.3. Activate the PCAS when an actual or suspected unauthorized aircraft
     movement is noticed or reported.
     4.12.2.4. Suspend airfield operations as required, and notify other affected aircraft of
     temporary landing or taxi restrictions.
     4.12.2.5. Authorize responding vehicles to aircraft location via the most direct or
     requested route. Provide progressive movement/interception directions if necessary.
     4.12.2.6. Respond to the requests of the Incident Commander when command is
     established. Requests may include changes to airfield lighting, NAVAIDS, or other
     equipment and services required to stop unauthorized aircraft movement.
     4.12.2.7. Notify AMOPS and CP of termination time.
62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                      33

                                  SPECIAL PROCEDURES

5.1. C-130 Landing Zone (LZ) Operations (Runway 162/342):
   5.1.1. Circling approaches to the LZ are not authorized. C-130 aircraft making an
   instrument/visual approach to the runway can transition to the LZ if the following conditions
   are met:
      5.1.1.1. Weather is at or above 1,000’ ceiling and 3 miles visibility.
      5.1.1.2. The aircraft requests the transition and reports the LZ in sight.
      5.1.1.3. Tower approves the transition to the LZ.
      5.1.1.4. Aircraft requesting a transition to the LZ from an instrument approach are
      transitioning from IFR to VFR operations.
   5.1.2. Aircraft taxiing out for departure must hold short of the north run-up pad and
   Taxiways Bravo, Charlie, and Delta west of the runway during all LZ operations. NOTE:
   All turnoffs from the LZ are toward Taxiway Hotel unless otherwise directed/authorized by
   Tower.
   5.1.3. Transmissions to and from aircraft will include the phrase "LZ North (runway 34) or
   South (runway 16)." (Example: "Wind Three Four Zero at One Zero LZ North Cleared to
   Land" or “Report Left Base LZ South.”)
   5.1.4. Separation Criteria (Departures). Departures from the main runway are not authorized
   when aircraft are on the LZ. (EXCEPTION: Runway 16 departures from Taxiway Delta
   may be approved provided the LZ traffic has stopped or exited onto Taxiway Charlie West).
   Departures from the LZ are not authorized when an aircraft is on the runway north of
   Taxiway Delta.
   5.1.5. Separation Criteria (Arrival):
      5.1.5.1. LZ-North Arrival preceded by a Runway 34/LZ North Arrival: Preceding
      arriving traffic must be clear of the runway/LZ and established west of the VFR hold line
      or prior to the LZ aircraft crossing the LZ landing threshold.
      5.1.5.2. Runway 34 Landing preceded by a LZ-North Landing: The LZ traffic must be
      clear of the LZ and headed toward Taxiway Hotel prior to the runway 34 landing traffic
      crosses the runway landing threshold.
      5.1.5.3. LZ-South Landing preceded by a Runway 16/LZ Landing: Runway 16 traffic
      must be west of the VFR hold line or on the runway south of Taxiway Delta prior the LZ
      traffic crossing the LZ landing threshold.
      5.1.5.4. Runway 16 Landing preceded by a LZ-South Landing: The LZ traffic must be
      clear of the LZ and headed toward Taxiway Hotel before landing traffic crosses the
      runway 16 landing threshold.
   5.1.6. Nighttime LZ operations require coordination with AMOPS and Tower. AMOPS will
   notify Tower of scheduled nighttime operations.
 34                                                                62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011


   5.1.7. Simultaneous operations to the runway and LZ are not authorized.
   5.1.8. LZ is for C-130 aircraft use only. Smaller than C-130 aircraft may use the LZ as
   authorized by 62 OG/CC (i.e., during AMC Rodeo competition).
   5.1.9. No-light LZ operations may be conducted with 62 OG/CC approval. Users shall be
   instructed to abide by the operating procedures in this instruction and the operation will be at
   ―own risk.‖ (See paragraph 5.3)
5.2. Combat Offload Operations:
   5.2.1. Taxiway Charlie, east of the runway, is the primary combat offload area. Aircraft will
   taxi to Taxiway Delta, east of the runway, and then turn left onto Taxiway Charlie. Aircrew
   will initiate the combat offload at the intersection of Charlie and Delta and taxi northwest
   along Taxiway Charlie. Taxiway Bravo, east of the runway, is the alternate combat offload
   location and requires 62 OG/CC approval for this operation. Taxiway Bravo will only be
   used if Taxiway Charlie is unsafe (aircraft on the taxiway, construction, etc.); awaiting an
   AMOPS FOD check is not a sufficient reason to allow combat offloads on Taxiway Bravo.
   Aircraft will taxi to the eastern most portion of the taxiway and execute a right 180 turn. The
   aircrew will initiate the combat offload operation at the intersection of Bravo and Foxtrot and
   taxi southwest along Taxiway Bravo.
   5.2.2. The following conditions preclude use of Taxiway Bravo:
      5.2.2.1. When the reported ceiling is less than 800 feet and/or the visibility less than 2
      miles and an aircraft is cleared for an ILS approach to runway 16.

      NOTE 1: Aircraft on Taxiway Bravo East must be east of the instrument hold line once
      an aircraft is inside the FAF to runway 16 and the weather is less than 800/2.

      NOTE 2: Due to erroneous glide slope readings with aircraft operating on Taxiway
      Bravo East, tower will notify aircraft inbound on ILS final of any aircraft within the
      combat offload area regardless of weather conditions.
      5.2.2.2. When any aircraft are parked on Kilo 2.
   5.2.3. Condition precluding use of Taxiway Charlie: Any aircraft parked on Foxtrot 40.
   5.2.4. Procedures for a combat offload:
      5.2.4.1. Aircraft will:
          5.2.4.1.1. Obtain taxi clearance to the selected combat offload location from Ground
          Control.
          5.2.4.1.2. Obtain clearance to begin combat offload operation from Ground Control.
          5.2.4.1.3. Advise Ground Control when combat offload operation is complete.
          5.2.4.1.4. Hold short of the runway until cleared to cross by Ground Control.
      5.2.4.2. Tower will:
          5.2.4.2.1. Approve/disapprove the commencement of the combat offload operation
          based on traffic/weather conditions.
62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                           35


           5.2.4.2.2. When a combat offload operation is approved, departures will not be
           permitted and landing aircraft will not be allowed closer than landing threshold.
           5.2.4.2.3. Upon receiving notification of combat offload termination, normal
           operations may resume.
           5.2.4.2.4. Restricted low approaches may be approved during the combat offload
           operation.
           5.2.4.2.5. Notify AMOPS when combat offloads are complete if aircraft dropped a
           pallet.
       5.2.4.3. AMOPS will:
           5.2.4.3.1. Accomplish FOD check after the operation has terminated if a pallet was
           dropped.
           5.2.4.3.2. Ensure that all maintenance equipment is secured or moved off parking
           spots F1 and F2.
5.3. Night Vision Device (NVD) Operations. IAW AFI 13-204, Vol 3, non-participating
aircraft will not mix with participating NVD aircraft in any traffic pattern or on any controlled
movement area. EXCEPTION: Aircraft not performing NVD operations may mix with NVD
aircraft provided they are in compliance with the procedures outlined in this instruction and 62
OGI 11-1/11-1A.
   5.3.1. Scheduling Procedures. Units requesting NVD operations must coordinate with 62
   OSS/OSK, Combat Tactics Flight (DSN 382-3614) and 62 OSS/OSO, Current Operations
   Flight (DSN 382-9920) at least 24 hours prior to operations. 62 OSS/OSO will schedule all
   NVD operations on the Wing Daily Flying Schedule using GDSS2. The schedule will be
   posted NLT 1700L the day prior to execution. Specific times for airspace and runway use
   will be annotated and deconflicted using the Air Movement Table. NVD training will
   normally not be scheduled past 2300L due to quiet hours. 62 OSS/OSO will coordinate with
   62 OG/CC for a quiet hour waiver and 62 OSS/OSA to ensure adequate ATC manning for
   any NVD training scheduled past 2300L. In the event that two transient aircraft, one
   participating and one non-participating, are attempting to fly local patterns, priority will be
   given to any aircraft with a PPR. If neither aircraft has a PPR, then priority will be on a first-
   come, first-serve basis.
   5.3.2. Notification/Coordination Requirements. Any base-assigned aircraft not scheduled
   for NVD operations may request the procedure with McChord tower. Tower will approve
   operation on a first-come, first-serve basis, workload permitting. Unscheduled aircraft will
   be the first to terminate procedures should it become necessary. 62 AW Command Post (CP)
   will provide priority guidance if scheduling conflicts arise. If a scheduling conflict arises,
   pilots are expected to deconflict with CP. Transient aircraft must be briefed by 62 OSS/OSK
   on procedures outlined in this instruction and 62 OGI 11-1/11-1A, and scheduled before they
   are authorized to mix the pattern with participating aircraft.
       5.3.2.1. AMOPS will conduct an airfield check of the designated NVD runway, taxi
       routes and IR lighting configuration prior to the start of NVD operations. Document and
       report discrepancies immediately. As a minimum notify the Tower, CP, AFM, and
       AOF/CC if NVD operations must be suspended to due airfield safety hazards.
36                                                                 62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011


     5.3.2.2. Tower will:
         5.3.2.2.1. Include an advisory on the ATIS broadcast at least 30 minutes prior to, or
         as soon as practical thereafter, of NVD operations commencing and continuing
         through the duration of operations. “NVD OPERATIONS IN EFFECT AT
         MCCHORD FIELD UNTIL XXXXZ. ALL NON-PARTICIPATING AIRCRAFT
         CONTACT GROUND CONTROL 10 MINUTES PRIOR TO DEPARTURE OR
         PATTERN ENTRY FOR COORDINATION.”
         5.3.2.2.2. If the ATIS is out of service, Tower will broadcast NVD operations
         commencement on Local and Ground Control frequencies 30 minutes prior to NVD
         operations or as soon as practical thereafter. “NVD OPERATIONS AT MCCHORD
         FIELD (WILL BEGIN AT XXXXZ).”
  5.3.3. Weather Requirements. Minimum weather requirements at McChord Field will be
  2000’ AGL ceiling and 3 miles visibility for the rectangular pattern and 2500’ AGL ceiling
  and 3 miles visibility for the overhead pattern. Aircrews may fly IFR instrument approaches
  that transition to NVD landings provided they comply with proficiency and weather
  minimums IAW AFI 11-2C17, Vol 3, C-17 Operations Procedures.
  5.3.4. NVD Aircraft Taxi Routes and NVD Traffic Pattern. Non-participating aircraft will
  not be allowed to taxi until appropriate lighting is activated. All participating aircraft will
  advise Tower of intended NVD taxi route. Taxiway lights will remain on unless specifically
  requested by NVD aircrews. No restrictions apply once the airfield lighting is turned off and
  pilots accept risk associated with unlit taxiways. Standard VFR traffic patterns will be flown
  to all runways IAW this regulation and AFI 11-2C17, Vol 3. Aircraft making approaches are
  expected to remain within the Class D airspace unless coordinated with tower. If aircraft are
  unable to maintain required cloud clearance at 1800’, the tower pattern will be closed and
  operations terminated.
  5.3.5. Vehicle Operations. Vehicle movement will be restricted in the vicinity of the runway
  during NVD operations. Vehicle movement on the rest of the airfield is unrestricted. No
  specific routing is necessary. Vehicle operations should be kept to a minimum during
  periods of reduced airfield lighting, although there is no requirement for vehicles to operate
  without normal vehicle lighting. Vehicles are required to meet requirements to maintain two-
  way radio communications with Tower while operating within the CMA.
  5.3.6. Traffic Pattern/Flow Restrictions. Aircraft operating IAW with this instruction will be
  considered as ―participating aircraft‖ for purposes of handling by Tower. A participating
  aircraft is one that is utilizing an LZ either in the overt or covert configuration, using NVD to
  a blacked out runway, or an aircraft not on NVDs that has agreed to comply with this
  regulation. A non-participating aircraft is any aircraft either VFR or IFR requiring standard
  runway lighting that has not agreed to comply with NVD procedures. VFR transitions will
  be considered non-participating and will be provided standard separation (under normal
  circumstances VFR transitions will not prevent NVD operations).
     5.3.6.1. No more than three aircraft may operate within the Class Delta surface area
     when NVD procedures are in effect. The tower watch supervisor (WS) may reduce NVD
     operations to less than three if he/she deems it necessary.
62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                         37


      5.3.6.2. Aircrews will avoid all locally defined no-fly areas and noise abatement areas as
      defined in this instruction when performing NVD operations at McChord Field.
      5.3.6.3. Aircrews will operate within the pattern IAW AFI 11-2C-17 Vol 3 and this
      instruction.
      5.3.6.4. When commencing NVD operations within the lateral/vertical limits of Class D
      airspace, aircraft will remain in the Class D airspace unless otherwise authorized by
      tower. Class D extensions will be requested by aircrews in a timely manner for ATC
      coordination.
      5.3.6.5. NVD Operations Phaseology: Aircrews will use phraseology in Table 5.1 when
      requesting permission from Tower to conduct NVD operations. Tower controllers will
      use the phraseology in Table 5.2 when clearing participating aircraft for
      arrivals/departure.

Table 5.1. Aircrew Phraseology Examples.
 “TOWER, ACID, REQUEST RUNWAY 16/34 ASSAULT”
 “TOWER, ACID, REQUEST RUNWAY 16/34, 500-FOOT NVG”
 “TOWER, ACID, REQUEST RUNWAY 16/34, 1000-FOOT NVG”

Table 5.2. Controller Phraseology Examples.
 “ACID, RUNWAY 16 ASSAULT, CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF”
 “ACID, RUNWAY 34, 500-FOOT NVG, CLEARED FOR THE OPTION”
 “ACID, RUNWAY 16, 1000-FOOT NVG, CLEARED TO LAND”
   5.3.7. NVD Operation Suspension, Termination, and Resumption Procedures. NVD
   operations may be suspended for the following reasons: unsafe airfield condition, emergency
   response, in the opinion of the tower WS, or for a non-participating aircraft departure/arrival.
   The tower WS has the authority to suspend, terminate, or resume operations at their
   discretion.
      5.3.7.1. IAW FAAO 7110.65, Tower will resume NVD lighting when a departing non-
      participating aircraft departs the Class Delta airspace. Tower will restore normal lighting
      for a non-participating IFR arrival before the aircraft begins approach or before a non-
      participating VFR arrival enters the Class D airspace. Lights will remain on until the
      arrival is clear of the runway or, if taxiway lights are requested off, when the inbound
      aircraft has parked. Tower will use the following phraseology prior to terminating NVD
      operations: ―ATTENTION (ALL ACFT) or (CALL SIGN), (LZ) / (NVD) OPERATIONS
      TERMINATED/SUSPENDED FOR (REASON).”                       May be followed by “SAY
      INTENTIONS.”
      5.3.7.2. Tower will advise aircraft of anticipated delay to NVD operations if known.
      5.3.7.3. Emergency knock-off/termination of NVD operations may be initiated by ATC
      or the aircrew at any time.
   5.3.8. McChord Tower Cab Lighting Configuration. The tower cab lighting configuration
   will be at the discretion of the WS.
 38                                                               62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011


   5.3.9. Airfield Lighting Configuration. Airfield lighting during NVD operations will vary
   depending on NVD operation requested by the pilot. Airfield lighting is outlined in
   Attachments 8-11. Standard airfield lighting will be turned on for non-participating aircraft
   IAW FAAO 7110.65. Air traffic controllers will notify participating NVD aircrews prior to
   turning on standard airfield lighting.
      5.3.9.1. Runway. Airfield lighting on runway will be completely turned off (to include
      approach lighting, PAPIs, REILs, etc.). Non-participating aircraft and vehicles will not
      be allowed to enter the runway. Desired LZ lights will be turned on as requested by
      participating aircraft.
      5.3.9.2. Ramps. All ramp lighting will remain on.
      5.3.9.3. Rotating Beacon. The rotating beacon will remain on.
      5.3.9.4. Airfield Obstruction Lighting. Airfield obstruction lights will remain on.
      5.3.9.5. Restoring Airfield Lighting. Airfield lighting will be restored:
          5.3.9.5.1. At the termination of NVD operations.
          5.3.9.5.2. When required for emergency response.
          5.3.9.5.3. When required in the opinion of the tower WS.
          5.3.9.5.4. When required for a non-participating aircraft departure or arrival IAW the
          following guidelines:
      5.3.9.6. Restore taxiway lighting along the intended taxi route prior to a non-
      participating aircraft taxiing, if previously turned off.
      5.3.9.7. For arriving and departing non-participating aircraft, Tower will follow
      paragraph 5.3.7.1
   5.3.10. Aircraft Lighting Requirements. There are currently no exceptions to FAR 91.209
   granted by the FAA allowing aircraft position/anti-collision lights out operations within any
   tower surface area airspace class within the U.S.
   5.3.11. Vehicle Lighting Requirements. Vehicles operating on the airfield must utilize
   proper lighting IAW 62 AWI 13-201, Airfield Driving. Vehicles operating lights-out during
   periods of reduced airfield lighting must use hazard warning flashers so that tower/aircrew
   can see the vehicle. Mounted IR strobes are not authorized.
5.4. C-17 Aerial Demonstration Flights. Demonstration flights will be conducted in 6-, 10-,
and 12-minute profiles at 1,500 feet AGL and below.
   5.4.1. Aircrews should coordinate with AMOPS at least 24 hours prior to demonstration
   flights for appropriate NOTAM notification.
   5.4.2. AMOPS will send appropriate NOTAM for the duration of the flight(s).
   5.4.3. Tower will:
      5.4.3.1. Notify Seattle Approach once a demonstration flight has taxied out for departure.
      5.4.3.2. Ensure all aircraft have exited and no other aircraft enter the Class D once a
      demonstration flight becomes airborne.
62AWI13-202 27 MAY 2011                                                                    39


       5.4.3.3. Limit transmissions to the aircraft to the maximum extent possible once the
       flight becomes airborne.
       5.4.3.4. Disapprove all aircraft/vehicle requests to enter/cross the runway during the
       profile.
       5.4.3.5. Notify Seattle Approach and AMOPS when the demonstration flight is
       complete.
5.5. Tactical Ordnance Procedures. Transient aircraft may operate out of McChord Field with
live ordnance. Transient aircraft must provide 30 days (preferable) but not less than 15 days
prior notice to the 62 AW Plan and Programs office (XP). Transient aircraft must be compliant
with parent command and AMC safety directives, and abide by the following:
   5.5.1. Approved by the 62 AW Commander.
   5.5.2. Maximum number of aircraft involved must be provided during initial request. Any
   changes must again be coordinated with 62 AW/XP prior to arrival.
5.6. Unusual Maneuvers. Tower will not approve pilot requests to conduct unusual maneuvers
within the Class D airspace unless they are essential to flight performance (reference FAAO
7110.65).
5.7. Request Procedures for Parachute Jumps/Airdrops onto McChord Field:
   5.7.1. Units requesting parachute jumps or airdrops onto Farmer or Crate drop zones must
   send a written request to 62 OSS Current Operations (62 OSS/OSO) at least 5 days in
   advance, or as soon as possible there after. Requests are signed by the Flight Commander or

   agencies:
       5.7.2.1. Airfield Operations (OSA).
       5.7.2.2. Airspace Manager (OSK).
       5.7.2.3. Airdrop Operations (OSOX).
       5.7.2.4. McChord Command Post
       5.7.2.5. Seattle Approach Control Supervisor.
       5.7.2.6. Requesting unit.
   5.7.3. On-Field Airdrop ATC Procedures: All procedures will be IAW the Airdrop
   Operations at McChord Field LOA and the Rogers DZ IFR Airdrop Corridor Procedures
   LOA.
5.8. Special VFR (SVFR) Procedures:
   5.8.1. Tower controllers will not approve simultaneous IFR and SVFR operations in the
   Class Delta Surface Area. IFR aircraft will have landed or departed the Class Delta Surface
   Area prior to allowing SVFR aircraft operations.
   5.8.2. Tower shall notify Seattle Approach when SVFR aircraft have been authorized to
   transition or operate in the Class Delta Surface Area.
   5.8.3. SVFR operations will be authorized on a one-in, one-out basis when no conflict with
   IFR traffic exists.
   5.8.4. All other SVFR phraseology and procedures will be IAW Seattle Approach/McChord
   Field LOA and FAAO 7110.65.
5.9. Flight Check Procedures:
   5.9.1. Tower controllers will control all flight check aircraft IAW FAAO 7110.65.
   5.9.2. Flight check aircraft will receive special handling as required to expedite the
   evaluation.
5.10. VR331 Procedures. VR331 is a high-speed, low-level route approaching the runway
from the south. Aircraft inbound on VR331 will report approximately 20 miles south of the field
at point GOLF. Aircraft will be at airspeeds above 300KTS and operating VFR at low altitude.
Controllers must be aware the speed of aircraft inbound on VR331 will decrease normal space to
sequence aircraft inside of them. East Gate procedures provide additional traffic conflict for
VR331 procedures. Although use of VR331 is specifically addressed in the Gray Army
Airfield/McChord Tower LOA; controllers should be vigilant for traffic conflicts with East Gate
traffic from Gray AAF.
