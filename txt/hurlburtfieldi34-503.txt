SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Changes have
been made to the daily operations, responsibilities and manning of the Hurlburt Field
Honor Guard (HFHG).
1. General. The objective of the Hurlburt Field Honor Guard (HFHG) program is to provide on
request, well trained, highly professional personnel to conduct military honors and ceremonies
and preserve the finest traditions and history of Air Force Special Operations Command
(AFSOC) and the Air Force. In order to comply with the congressionally mandated requirement
to provide military honors for veterans, a structured Honor Guard program is essential.
2. Manning. The HFHG will be composed of active duty military personnel assigned or
attached to Hurlburt Field. All personnel assigned to the Honor Guard must meet and/or exceed
Air Force standards of personal appearance In accordance with (IAW) AFI 36-2903, Dress and

for Honor Guard duty. Personnel must have at least 12 months retainability to fulfill their
commitment to the program.

     minimum of 70 enlisted members. The Honor Guard will have two permanently assigned
     members consisting of an NCOIC and an Assistant NCOIC (ANCOIC). Honor Guard
     manning must remain steady at 70 members to meet team objectives. If objectives cannot be
     met, then requests for honors will be based on order of precedence with funerals always
     taking priority.

     quota is based upon the number of E-6 and below in each group. Senior NCOs and officers
     may volunteer to serve in the Honor Guard but will not be counted as part of the group quota.
     Tenant unit volunteers will be accepted but will not be counted as a part of the group quota.
     An Honor Guard member will not be released from his/her commitment until a replacement
     has been named.
     2.3. The 1st Special Operations Wing Command Chief (1 SOW/CCC) will use manpower
     data to determine group quotas and will determine on a yearly basis if the group quota is to
     be decreased or increased based on total manning. Units desiring exemption towards being
     counted in the manning need to submit their exemption request to the 1 SOW/CCC. Once
     group quotas are determined, the group chiefs and first sergeants will set unit quotas.
     2.4. Members assigned to the Honor Guard will be exempt from all base and squadron
     details during the duration of their tour. They will not serve as Security Forces augmentees,
     bay orderly or on base exercises during the duration of their tour.

     with volunteers, appointment will be mandatory.
     2.6. The minimum tour of duty for all members will be 12 months unless waived by
     agreement. The waiver must have sufficient justification and cause, between the appropriate
