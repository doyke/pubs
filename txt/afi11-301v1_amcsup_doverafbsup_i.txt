SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is a major revision and must be reviewed entirely. It includes initial guidance for the new
Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) career field (AFSC 1P0X1), which includes and merges the
former Aircrew Life Support (AFSC 1T1X1) and Survival Equipment (AFSC 2A7X4) career
fields. It modifies MAJCOM and other agency responsibilities, and updates office symbols.
Life Support Officers (LSO) are referred to as Flight Equipment Officers (FEO). Previous
guidance relating to Mobility, CBRN, and contingency operations has been moved to AFI 11-
301, Volume 3, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) Combat Operations, (forthcoming).

Program Guidance Letter (PGL), Aircrew Life Support and Survival Equipment Career
Field Merger, dated 12 March 2008 implemented the Chief of Staff of the Air Force direction
to merge these two career fields, and created a new AFE (AFSC 1P0X1) career field with all
functions, manpower, and personnel organizationally aligned to the Operations Support
Squadron (OSS) under the Operations Group (OG) to include all military, civil service, and
contractor equivalent. A copy of this PGL can be obtained from HQ USAF/A3O-AT
(Operational Training Division).

(AMC) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Revised as a
supplement to AFI 11-301. This revision is a compilation and consolidation of information
formerly contained in previous AFI 11-301, dated 1 June 98, MAJCOM 11-301 Instructions, as
well as supplements thereto. Among the changes too numerous to mention in this section, are
the expanded guidelines on minimum aircrew protective clothing requirements (chapter 7),
guidelines for Aircrew Flight Equipment deployment and contingency operations (chapter 8) and
expands and provides guidance on the management and redistribution of excess or shortage of
equipment (Attachments 4 - 7).

                                            Chapter 1

                                          OVERVIEW

1.1. Mission. Provide USAF aircrew safe and effective aircrew flight equipment and programs
to increase aircrew performance. Protect and sustain human life during flight operations.
Prepare aircrew and passengers to survive, affect their rescue, and return to duty if forced to
abandon their aircraft during an emergency. Provide aircrew protection from effects of
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) weapons.
1.2. Program Objectives:
     1.2.1. Increase combat capability of the total weapon system by enhancing and maximizing
     the performance and survivability of the aircrew.
     1.2.2. Reduce injuries and increase survival rates by providing aircrew and passengers with
     the best equipment available through new technologies, system training, and quality system
     maintenance.
     1.2.3. Identify requirements for modernization and new equipment by analyzing: customer-
     validated operational requirements, operational deficiencies, USAF suggestions and
     recommendations, Air Force Technical Order (TO) improvement reports, aircraft mishap
     investigation and safety report recommendations, and joint developmental programs from
     other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies.
     1.2.4. Train aircrew and passengers to use their Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) in a
     manner that reinforces recall during emergency situations. Training should be accomplished
     using training equipment that mirrors operational equipment and realistic scenarios, in which
     aircrew and passengers are likely to encounter. Realistic training will ensure aircrew and
     passengers have confidence in their equipment and increase their ability to use it.

  the parachute logs and records. The IPI inspector will annotate the appropriate locally
  developed IPI checklist.
  3.7.5. The original technician (inspector) will correct all discrepancies prior to the piece of
  equipment being placed back in service.
  3.7.6. Monitor QC documentation (e.g., AF IMT 2420, Quality Control Inspection
  Summary, or equivalent) to identify positive and negative trends. Provide QC documentation
  to the AFE QA function monthly or earlier if a negative trend is identified.
     3.7.6.1. (Added-AMC) As an optional tool, AMC AFE units may use locally developed
     programs (i.e. QC Performance and Tracking Program or "QMCI" Program) and modify
     it to best suit their unit needs.
     3.7.6.2. (Added-AMC) Squadron NCOICs will have active involvement with the
     quality assurance program. While the AFE Superintendent may direct other AFE
     personnel to conduct QC inspections, he/she holds primary responsibility for the QC
     program.
     3.7.6.3. (Added-AMC) The AFE Superintendent will use the standardized QA reports
     in ALERTS to develop and track their QA program. QC records will be retained for two
     years. The program allows the AFE leadership to identify problem areas and implement
     corrective action. Does not apply to AFRC or ANG units unless they have been
     designated as ALERTS users.
  3.7.7. AFE personnel certified to clear ―Red-X‖ discrepancies will be annotated on the
  automated SCR, designated by unit commander via appointment letter for units that do not
  have access to an automated SCR, or as determined by applicable MAJCOM and ANG.
  AFE ―Red-X‖ certified personnel will be a 1P071 (or equivalent). The first O-6 in the chain
  of command may waive the 7-level requirement for a SSgt (E-5) or SrA (E-4) to clear ―Red-
  X‖ discrepancies based on their experience and technical expertise; such a waiver will
  terminate once a sufficient quantity of 7-levels are available.
     3.7.7.1. (Added-AMC) The AFE Superintendent and all 7-skill level personnel will be
     Red-X certified. Use the AMC Form 64, Request for Special Certification, to request and
     process Red X and IPI certification. The AFE Superintendent will certify and maintain
     AMC Form 64 for each individual who is Red X certified IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and
AFI11-301V1_AMCSUP_DOVERAFBSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2012                                                    41


       Equipment Maintenance Management. Ensure sufficient numbers of Red X certified
       personnel are available to support home station and deployed operations, as applicable.
       The AFE Superintendent will coordinate local procedures with the Maintenance Group
       Quality Assurance Section concerning Red X qualifications and letters. The Red X
       designation will be used to document a complete download of AFE installed equipment
       and IAW 00-20-1. A red dash or diagonal will be used to document a shortage of AFE
       equipment required per mission configuration in AFI 11-301VOL 2 or 11-2MDS Vol 3
       Addenda A. Not applicable to AFRC units. ANG AFE Superintendents will certify all
       IPIs.
3.8. Composite Tool Kit (CTK) Program. The objectives of the CTK program are to prevent
and eliminate Foreign Object Damage (FOD) to aircraft, engines, missiles, training and support
equipment, and to reduce tool cost through effective control of assets.
   3.8.1. Establish a CTK and lost tool procedure program to control and account for tools used
   in each AFE section IAW AFI 21-101, Chapter 10, and AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Part 13,
   Chapter 8, as well as MAJCOM, and wing/unit directives.
       3.8.1.1. (Added-DOVER) Missing Tool Procedure. All available means will be
       exhausted to locate a missing tool. If the tool cannot be located (no later than the end of
       the shift when the tool was discovered missing) the AFE Superintendent, Maintenance
       Group Quality Assurance (MXG QA) office, Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) and
       applicable supervisor will be notified with the type, quantity, nine digit identifier,
       location, date and time the tool was discovered missing. MXG QA may issue additional
       instructions with additional requirements.
NOTE: AFE sections are authorized to manually track all their CTKs, or ALERTS is authorized
as well for AFE sections to track their CTKs. AFE sections are not required to use the
automated Tool Accountability System (TAS). Units will develop local tracking procedures that
will include quantity of serviceable/unserviceable oxygen connectors dispatched to and from the
flightline (if applicable).

   3.8.2. Each tool, item of equipment, or consumable contained in a CTK has an assigned
   location identified either by inlay cuts in the shape of the item, shadowed layout, or
   silhouette. No more than one item is stored in a cutout, shadow, or silhouette except for tools
   issued in sets such as drill bits, allen wrenches, apexes, or paired items (e.g., gloves, booties).
   NOTE: Personal tools are NOT authorized on the flightline or in any maintenance area. (e.g.,
   Mini-Mag type flashlights, Leatherman type multi-tools, buck knives).
   3.8.3. Units must place the 9-digit Equipment Identifier (EID) on all CTKs, tools not
   assigned to a box, and dispatchable equipment that is of sufficient size. The 9-digit EID must
   be placed on the outside of dispatchable CTKs. Tools located inside the tool box may be
   marked with less than 9-digits but must contain the 4-digit World Wide Identification
   (WWID) and identifying characters that tie the tool back to the CTK. For example, tools
   inside an assigned dispatchable CTK ―U6JG00001‖ may be marked ―U6JG1‖.
   3.8.4. Inventory requirements. As a minimum, account for all CTKs, tools, and dispatchable
   equipment at the beginning and end of each shift, when moving from aircraft to aircraft,
 42                        AFI11-301V1_AMCSUP_DOVERAFBSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2012


   annually, and when custodians change. NOTE: Annual inventories do not replace inventories
   conducted each shift.
   3.8.5. Tool Accountability. AFE Flight commanders, superintendents and section NCOICs,
   through CTK custodians, are responsible for tool and equipment accountability and control
   (knowing where tools are and who has responsibility for them.) When a person signs for a
   tool or piece of equipment, they are accountable for the item until it is returned to the AFE
   section and accountability transfers back to the CTK custodian.
   3.8.6. (Added-AMC) All AFE units will develop a dispatchable flightline Consolidated
   Tool Kit(s). AFE personnel will comply with the CTK requirements found in AFI 21-101,
   AMC Supplement and local guidance. Dispatchable CTKs are optional for ANG and AFRC
   units; however ANG and AFRC units must, as a minimum, establish an inventory tracking
   system for any item taken aboard an aircraft.

   available and presented during LL06. Perform TCTO or modifications on all training
   equipment to ensure it mirrors and functions the same as operational equipment.
   5.3.9. (Added-AMC) If AFE ―LL‖ event objectives are taught and met during SS events,
   units are authorized to give credit for the LL event, as long as objectives are taught at the
   same intervals. To maximize course and aircrew time availability, AFE Superintendent will
   review all local AFECT Instructor Guides and ensure objectives and information is not
   repeated in other courses, such as in SERE events (SS Courses) or CE Emergency
   Management events (ground crew chemical defense). The AFE Superintendent will
   coordinate with other functional areas to ensure objectives are taught in appropriate
   course(s).

5.10. Lesson Plans Development Guidance:
   5.10.1. AFECT Air Force Master Lesson Plans. AFMLPs are documents developed to
   prescribe instructional requirements, teaching points, and instructor-student activities
   essential to the accomplishment of training objectives for all AFECT. AFMLPs are designed
   to include the minimum training requirements and are essential for supervisors and
   instructors to ensure lesson objectives are completed.
   5.10.2. Only approved AFMLPs developed by the 361 TRS/TRR AFE CDC Writer,
   Sheppard AFB, TX will be used to conduct AFECT. The AFMLPs, developed by the 361
   TRS/TRR, are complete and ready be downloaded once they have been approved by Lead
   MDS MAJCOM. Units should delete information from the AFMLPs that does not pertain to
   their mission or unit. MAJCOMs will use AFMLPs developed by the 361 TRS/TRR.
   Furthermore, ARC units that have AFECTIs who are solely responsible for conducting code
   of conduct continuation training events will only use lesson plans approved by AFRC/A3TS
   or NGB/A3OS.
   5.10.3. The FEO or AFE superintendent must tailor down the AFMLP and produce an
   AFECT Master Lesson Plan (MLP) to meet their wings mission needs. AFECT MLP are un-
   personalized lesson plans used for control and standardization within an organization or unit
   that has been developed from the AFMLP by deleting unnecessary information based on a
   units equipment or MDS. Group FEO/AFE superintendents who identify a need for a new
   AFMLP will forward request to MAJCOMs or Lead MDS MAJCOM for review of new
   requirement(s). Approved requests will be forwarded, and all data from Subject Matter
   Expert (SME) for development of AFMLP to 361 TRS/TRR AFE CDC Writer, Sheppard
   AFB, TX.
   5.10.4. AFECT LP. Lesson plans are documents developed from the AFECT MLP and
   prepared for use by each instructor to organize and present information. A personalized
   lesson plan contains information to aid the instructor. This is accomplished by writing
   personal instructional notes and material on the right-hand side of the AFECT MLP. The
AFI11-301V1_AMCSUP_DOVERAFBSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2012                                           61


   lesson plan must be validated with approved reference materials that can be produced upon
   request.
   5.10.5. All AFE MLPs and AFECT LPs used to conduct AFECT will be reviewed annually
   by the group FEO or AFE superintendent. Annual reviews will be documented as directed by
   individual MAJCOMs.
       5.10.5.1. (Added-AMC) AMC units will document annual MLP/LP reviews in a
       manner determined locally. Documentation must be standardized.
   5.10.6. Higher headquarters correspondence (e.g., messages, Flight Crew Information Files
   [FCIF], etc.) directing the inclusion of information not covered in AFECT AFMLPs or lesson
   plans will be added as directed by the 361 TRS/TRR.
   5.10.7. Designated Lead MAJCOM MDS SMEs will assist the 361 TRS/TRR in validating
   AFMLPs biennially during the World Wide AFE Workshop MAJCOM breakouts. If more
   frequent reviews are deemed necessary; the requesting MAJCOM will coordinate and fund
   for the CDC Writer to attend MAJCOM conference to accomplish the review with SMEs.
   The 361 TRS will notify the MAJCOMS of any changes to the AFMLPs and group
   FEO/AFE superintendent will update their MLPs upon notification by their MAJCOMs.

   that are not using ALERTS will use APWEB to document their end item data IAW the
   APWEB user manual. Each unit will provide all relevant data on each item to include;
   contract numbers, lot numbers, dates of manufacture, dates of expiration, back order
   quantities, off-base requisition numbers, and quantities deployed. The data contained within
   this site must be complete, verified, and validated by their respective MAJCOM prior to the
   unit being upgraded to ALERTS.
       6.2.3.1. (Added-AMC) Stock records will have all pertinent data input into ALERTS

      6.4.1.1. Purpose. ALERTS serves as the single focal point program in the documentation
      of all AFE processes. To meet the rapidly changing needs of the AFE community, the
      following process will be used to manage requests for modifications and new ALERTS
      capabilities outside of the scope of the current support contract. This process is described
      below.
      6.4.1.2. Changes to Policy/Procedure Documents and or ALERTS Processes.                 The
      identifying user will accomplish the following:
      6.4.1.2.1. Provide a written proposal of the complete suggested process to their
      MAJCOM FM.
          6.4.1.2.2. The MAJCOM FM will validate the need and forward the proposed
          process to the Air Force ALERTS OPR.
          6.4.1.2.3. The Air Force ALERTS OPR will forward the proposal to the support
          contractor for evaluation.
          6.4.1.2.4. The support contractor will evaluate the proposed process and determine
          the technical feasibility.
          6.4.1.2.5. If the need is technically feasible, the Air Force ALERTS OPR will
          validate and forward to all using commands for their input. MAJCOM ALERTS
          POCs have 10 working days to evaluate proposals. Negative replies are required. If
          the need applies to only the proposing command, the Air Force ALERTS OPR will
          validate the need and proceed to the next step.
             6.4.1.2.5.1. If all MAJCOMs’ POCs do not agree, the proposal will be forwarded
             to HQ USAF/A3O-AT for final resolution.
             6.4.1.2.5.2. If all ALERTS MAJCOMs’ POCs agree, the support contractor will

 66                        AFI11-301V1_AMCSUP_DOVERAFBSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2012


      6.4.5.1. Within APWEB, units attempting to enter data that is unavailable will use
      ―UNK‖ for unknown text fields, and 01/01/1900 for unknown date fields. All unknown
      data fields that are not mandatory will be left blank.
      6.4.5.2. Within ALERTS, all unknown data fields not mandatory will be left blank. For
      mandatory fields, units will use the APWEB standard.
      6.4.5.3. All contract number and lot number entries must include the full contract and lot
      number and be entered into ALERTS exactly as they appear on the item. This will
      ensure there is no confusion when data is recalled.
   6.4.6. LOGIN Standard for AFE Personnel and Aircrew. LOGIN standard is case sensitive
   and includes the last name, first initial, and last six numbers of individual’s SSN. AFE units
   must scan the one-dimensional bar code on the backside of the aircrew’s military
   identification card for the ALERTS login.
   6.4.7. APWEB and ALERTS Data Protection; For Official Use Only (FOUO):
      6.4.7.1. Reports generated from APWEB/ALERTS will be considered FOUO, unless

      6.4.7.2. Reports containing personnel data, i.e., SSN will have the privacy act statement
      affixed.
      6.4.7.3. Aircraft tail number location in ALERTS must use the last six digits as the
      standard (example: 99-0011). This will allow full integration of the new automated
      forecasting system and the requirements established by 84 MUSG/GJ (OO-ALC) for
      properly tracking and forecasting time change items for replacement.
          6.4.7.3.1. (Added-AMC) Aircraft Tail Number locations in ALERTS will use the
          full ten (10) digit aircraft production number (e.g. 88-00001234). Not Applicable for
          ANG units.
   6.4.8. Configuration Data File (CDF) Process:
      6.4.8.1. The CDF established for accountable equipment items will be maintained in
      AFEMS IAW AFMAN 23-110. Accountable and non-accountable equipment end item
      authorizations will be documented and maintained in APWEB/ALERTS. Air Staff,
      MAJCOMs, and 77 AESG when experiencing acquisition difficulties, may direct units to
      document authorizations and on-hand quantities within these programs.
6.5. ALERTS Operations Areas:
   6.5.1. Aircraft Accident Data Records. Upon notification from a competent authority, the
   AFE superintendent, squadron system administrator, or AFE NCOIC will freeze all AFE
   records for equipment involved in a mishap. To ensure data fidelity for the safety review
   board, these records will remain frozen until such time as determined by the involved
   MAJCOM Staff Judge Advocate or delegated authority. Once authority has been granted,
   the AFE superintendent will notify the contractor help desk to unfreeze the records.
   6.5.2. Data Review Requirement. AFE superintendents and NCOICs or designated
   individual will review APWEB and ALERTS to validate data accuracy every 180 days.

        ALERTS units, transfer the data to the MAJCOM selection of ―QUE‖, until such time
        as the unit begins using ALERTS. Provide the gaining non-ALERTS using unit
        ―hard copies‖ of all inspection records upon transfer. Not Applicable for ANG units.
     6.5.5.2. Units using ALERTS to transfer equipment, personnel, or aircraft records to
     non-ALERTS enabled units will still use the ALERTS electronic data transfer process.
     However, the information will be stored under a general identified Personnel Accounting
     System (PAS) code until the receiving unit comes online with ALERTS. The sending
     unit will also provide paper copies of all required forms.
  6.5.6. AF IMT 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, Process. AFE units with ALERTS fully
  implemented can use ALERTS in lieu of the AF IMT 1297 to transfer responsibility of the
  item. MAJCOMs may implement more restrictive accountability procedures as required.
  6.5.7. Contact Memory Button (CMB) Processes and Mounting. MAJCOMs will develop
  their own implementation process for units using the CMB.
  6.5.8. Interaction with Mobility Inventory Control & Accountability System (MICAS). Air
  Staff or MAJCOM will provide the APWEB or ALERTS data associated with MICAS to
  data managers when requested through these programs.
  6.5.9. Deployment and Multi-Command or Multi-Unit Operations:
     6.5.9.1. Units will use the guidance in the ALERTS user and process manuals for these
     operations. Units who do not have any ALERTS specialized equipment or are not
     connected to the ALERTS site while deployed will refer to paragraph 6.5.10 for
     documentation procedures.

   conditions in the AMC OMNIBUS OPLAN. Use these requirements during local exercises
   to ensure continued unit mission effectiveness.
   8.10.3. (Added-AMC) Ensure deployable equipment and trained technicians are available
   for AFE and ACCA operations. Upon arrival at deployed location, AFE will establish
   contact with SRC and disaster preparedness personnel to coordinate plans for ACCA
   construction and operation during increased stages of alert. ACCA operations should be
   collocated with ground-crew contamination control area (CCA) stations whenever possible.
   However, separate the aircrew and ground-crew CCA functions by a minimum distance of 50
   feet.
   8.10.4. (Added-AMC) Should staffing requirements and mission needs dictate, deployable
   augmentee resources may be trained in shelter operations and ACCA processing; however,
   they will not be trained or assigned in a capacity requiring AFE technical expertise (AFSC
   1P0X1).
   8.10.5. (Added-AMC) Aircrew ACDE/AERP ensemble sizes. AFE units must deploy with
   crew members’ individual ACDE/AERP ensemble size information to give AFE personnel
   the capability to requisition sized items as necessary for deployed aircrew. Units may
   develop local procedures to provide crew members their individual size information to have
   on their person while deployed.
8.11. (Added-AMC) AFE Staffing.
   8.11.1. (Added-AMC) HQ AMC/A3TL is the FM for AMC AFE staffing. AFE
   Superintendents are responsible for UTC staffing and unit mission contingency operations.
   8.11.2. (Added-AMC) When peacetime or exercise scenarios call for UTC adjustments, .65
   staffing times the number of deployable aircraft may be used for active duty units as a guide
   dependent upon hours of operation, number of aircraft and aircrew, and equipment at
   deployed location. Deploy one 7-skill level AFE technician (preferably a master or technical
   sergeant) or a Red X certified SSgt AFE supervisor when five or more aircraft are tasked.
   Deploy 3-skill level personnel at no more than a 2:1 ratio to supervisors/trainers, where 2
   equals number of 5/7- skill level personnel and 1 equals 3-skill level personnel.

  8.11.3. (Added-AMC) AMC UTCs tasked against ARC units identify mobilization staffing
  requirements. ANG/A3OS and HQ AFRC/A3TS will determine staffing requirements
  needed for in-place mobilization and for managing, supporting, and training Guard and
  Reserve units in a non-mobilized status IAW AFI 10-401.

AIR FORCE STANDARD AFE AUTOMATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (AIT)
                       BARCODE MARKING

Contractors and suppliers for all AFE systems to include subcomponents shall use bar code
nameplates, labels, or direct part markings IAW DoD MIL-STD-130 Change 1, DoD UID
Guide, and this document. Use of an advanced part marking technology like bar codes and 2D
symbols is essential to the AFE community being able to facilitate automated ―removal and
replace‖ features of automated programming and product support/maintenance. Exceptions to
use of machine-readable nameplates will be considered, on a case-by-case basis, in accordance
with practical or good business sense (e.g., part too small for nameplate, part immersed in fuel
tank, etc.). AFE will consider other advanced part marking technology should they become
commercially practicable, driven by DoD requirements, and or advantageous to the government
in the future.

Marking Requirements.

Human Readable Information (HRI) and Machine Readable Information (MRI) are required for
current AIT systems to provide the necessary advances in efficiency. Defense Federal
Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and the DoD has mandated the use of Data Matrix
ECC 200 as the standard format for UID MRI markings. Overarching guidance for the construct
and application of Data Matrix markings is contained in MIL-STD-130 and DoD UID Guide
located at www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/UID. Specific examples are given here for manufactures and
suppliers for implementation.

AFE has three different situations that require or can require different markings and they are:

a. UID Serialized Lot Batch; Items controlled with serial numbers and lot numbers
b. UID Serialized Data Stream; Items controlled with serial numbers only
c. Non UID/Non Serialized Lot Batch; Items that do not meet the UID requirement and are not
controlled with serial numbers.

See figures 1 – 6 for specific examples of the labels and data streams.

HRI Marking Requirements. The following HRI data is required (as a minimum):

- Manufacturer’s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, 5 alpha/numeric characters

- Item Lot Number

           NOTE: The Lot Number MUST be unique within the manufacturer’s
           CAGE (Lot Numbers cannot be repeated on other part numbers)

- Item Serial Number
AFI11-301V1_AMCSUP_DOVERAFBSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2012                                               109


           NOTE: Air Force contracts typically require 5 digit serial numbers
           (minimum), sequentially assigned, not to be repeated until serial number
           99,999 has been reached

- Item manufacturer’s Part Number

           NOTE: The weapon system Specification Number does not meet this
           requirement

- Contract Number (CNCT#), 13 alpha/numeric characters

- Date of Manufacture; Year and Day of manufacture in Julian Date format

           NOTE: Markings and/or attachments shall make no reference to item
           installation requirements/procedures or shelf/service lives.

MRI Data Construct.

Data Matrix ECC200 markings shall be developed based on UID Data Construct #2 using Data
Identifiers (DIs) in accordance with MIL-STD-130 and the DoD UID Guide (see Figure 2). To
facilitate durability throughout the scanning life cycle, the largest symbol size, including quiet
zone, shall be fitted within the available marking real estate. The symbol’s internal module (cell)
sizes shall be no smaller than 0.0075 inch (0.19 mm) and no larger than 0.025 inch (0.64 mm).
Marks shall contain only the data elements identified below:

           NOTE: The parentheses surrounding the Data Identifier are NOT encoded in the 2D
           symbol.

- (17V) Manufacturer’s Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, 5 alpha/numeric
characters.

- (1T) Item production Lot Number, IAW HRI requirement, Maximum 20 alpha/numeric,
including special characters (- or/).

           NOTE: The lot number MUST be unique within the manufacturer’s CAGE
           (Lot Numbers cannot be repeated on other part numbers)

- (S) Item Serial Number, IAW HRI requirement, Maximum 20 alpha/numeric including special
characters (- or/).

- (1P) Manufacturer’s Item Part Number, Maximum 20 alpha/numeric including special
characters (- or/).

           NOTE: The weapon system Specification Number does not meet this
           requirement.
     110                       AFI11-301V1_AMCSUP_DOVERAFBSUP_I 17 AUGUST 2012


    - (8K) Contract Number (Cont No), Maximum 13 alpha/numeric characters.

              NOTE: For this data element the dashes are not transmitted in the data stream.

    - (4D) Date of Manufacture (DOM) in Julian Date format, five numeric characters:

                                Example: 06151 = 31 May 2006

              The first two positions are the last two digits of the year; the last three
              positions are the Julian Date (001 through 366)
