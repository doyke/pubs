OO-ALC Form 500, DCPS Work Schedule Change; OO-ALC Form 501, DCPS Timecard Format 1;
and OO-ALC Form 502, DCPS Timecard Format 2. This publication provides policies and prescribes
procedures for time and attendance recording, certifying, and reporting into DCPS, for Hill AFB. Individ-
uals recording and approving officials have the responsibility to ensure policy in DOD 7000.14-R, Vol-
ume 8, Chapter 2 and this publication is adhered to. Maintain and dispose of records created as a result of

1. Responsibilities.
   1.1. Approving Officials attest to the best of their knowledge, the actual work schedules recorded are
   true, correct and accurate, on OO-ALC Form 501 or 502 and documented in writing.
   1.2. Individuals recording time and attendance on OO-ALC Form 501 or OO-ALC Form 502 must
   ensure employees have attested to the accuracy of their current pay periodâ€™s time and attendance
   (including any exceptions such as use of leave) and any adjustments or corrections. Entries for over-
   time and compensatory time earned have to be approved before certification. OO-ALC Form 500 is
   used to record changes to the DCPS information on personnel such as work shifts or work schedule
   changes. NOTE: Only certified T&A data reported on the OO-ALC Forms 501 and 502 are the
   source documents used to enter payroll information into the Defense Civilian Payroll System (DCPS).
   1.3. The certification of a T&A form is an authorization for the expenditure of government funds. The
   first-line supervisor is responsible for certifying T&A forms. However, in the absence of the first-line
   supervisor, the acting supervisor or the next level supervisor may certify T&A forms and approve
   leave. Certifying responsibilities should not be assigned to individuals who cannot actually observe
   employees' attendance and absence each day. Only the certifying official can make pen and ink

    changes on T&A forms. The certifying official must line through the error and make corrections as
    near as possible to the erroneous entry. The certifying official must initial each line-through correc-
    tion. Do not use whiteout or correction tape on T&A forms. One copy of each certified T&A form and
    documentation used for each pay period is to be kept available for audit, or for 6 years, whichever
    occurs first.
