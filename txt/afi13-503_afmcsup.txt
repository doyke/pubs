1. Purpose. To establish a clear, thorough and repeatable process to inform, facilitate and
document Air Force decisions on certification, decertification and operational restrictions of Air
Force nuclear-capable units. Nuclear-capable units are a unit or an activity assigned
responsibilities for employing, assembling, maintaining, transporting or storing war reserve
(WR) nuclear weapons, their associated components and ancillary equipment. This instruction
addresses the certification (initial and recertification), decertification and operational restrictions
placed on nuclear-capable units. This instruction applies to all Air Force units that are nuclear-
capable, to include Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard units.
2. Roles and Responsibilities.
   2.1. Assistant Chief of Staff (ACS), Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration (AF/A10)

       certification, decertification, recertification and operational restrictions.
   2.2. MAJCOM Commanders will:
       2.2.1. Certify or decertify nuclear-capable units. They have the authority to decertify
       any and all levels of a nuclear-capable unit. This authority may not be delegated. The
       MAJCOM commanders may delegate to the WG/CC the authority to place operational
       restrictions on units.
       2.2.1. (AFMC) Applicable AFMC Directorates, AFMC/A4, IG, SE and AF Nuclear
       Weapons Center (AFNWC) will provide a certification/decertification recommendation
       for each nuclear-capable unit to AFMC/A10. These recommendations will include
       rationale for the recommendation and relevant supporting data (e.g., Nuclear Surety
       Inspection (NSI) reports, Logistics Standardization and Evaluation Team/Logistics
       Compliance Assessment Program (LSET/LCAP) reports, and Staff Assistance Visit
       results). AFMC/A10 will consolidate inputs from applicable AFMC Directorates into an
       overall certification/decertification recommendation to AFMC/CC in the form of a Unit
       Nuclear Certification Package.
       2.2.2. Ensure AF/A10 is notified of all decisions regarding certification, decertification,
       recertification and operational restrictions of a nuclear-capable unit.

        2.2.6. Ensure procedures are developed to certify, decertify, recertify, operationally
        restrict and operationally unrestrict nuclear-capable units.
        2.2.6. (AFMC) AFMC/A10 will coordinate as necessary with SAF/IGI, HAF/A10 and
        AFGSC, and work with appropriate organizations to assess potential second/third order
        effects of certification, decertification, an operational restriction and an operational
        unrestriction.
        2.2.7. Ensure MAJCOM functional experts develop inspection criteria to be used by
        MAJCOM/IGs, in addition to required AF inspection criteria.
        2.2.7. (AFMC) AFMC/A4 is to provide functional expertise, manpower and training as
        necessary for fully or partially decertified units.
        2.2.8. MAJCOMs with nuclear missions will develop guidance and communication
        products as appropriate for unit Public Affairs to address issues of nuclear certification,
        decertification and restrictions.
        2.2.8. (AFMC) AFMC/A10 will make developed guidance and products available to
        Public Affairs when requested.
3. Certification of nuclear-capable units will be accomplished for initial assumption of a
nuclear mission or after the decertification of a nuclear-capable unit. Certification
authorizes nuclear-capable units to employ, maintain, store or transport nuclear weapons using
design certified equipment, facilities and procedures.
     3.1. The MAJCOM, in coordination with their respective MAJCOM Safety Office and the
     Air Force Safety Center/Weapons Safety Division (AFSEC/SEW), will determine a unit’s
     need for an Initial Nuclear Surety Inspection (INSI). Refer to AFI 63-125, Nuclear
     Certification Program to assist in determining INSI requirements. The MAJCOM
     commander will document the decision on whether an INSI is required. The signed
     memorandum will be distributed to the units affected and the recipients listed in Attachment
     2. The MAJCOM commander, through the designated lead staff agency, will prepare a
     training timeline and determine readiness of the unit to receive an INSI.
        3.1.1. Initial certification of a unit accepting a new mission or weapons system will be
        based on, as a minimum, the unit having the required personnel trained, qualified or
        certified if required on the new weapon system or mission.
        3.1.2. Units will maintain certification unless notified otherwise by MAJCOM
        commander. Units must complete Nuclear Surety Inspections (NSIs) per higher
        headquarters guidance.
     3.2. Document the MAJCOM commander’s certification in a memorandum (Attachment 3)
     sent to the unit and the recipient list in Attachment 2. If unit certification is part of a initial
     certification requirements, refer to AFI 63-125 for additional reporting requirements.
AFI13-503_AFMCSUP_I 5 JUNE 2014                                                                     5


4. Decertification of nuclear capable unit removes all of the unit’s authorization to employ,
assemble, maintain, transport or store WR nuclear weapons, their associated components and
ancillary equipment until the unit is recertified.
   4.1. Decertification can result from the following conditions:
       4.1.1. Results of inspections conducted by MAJCOM/IG, Defense Threat Reduction
       Agency (DTRA) or other inspection agencies, as applicable.
       4.1.2. Accident/incident or series of accidents/incidents that directly or indirectly affect
       the safety, security, reliability and control of nuclear weapons or calls into question the
       unit’s compliance/adherence to Department of Defense Nuclear Weapons System Safety
       Standards and/or Air Force Nuclear Weapon System Safety Rules IAW AFI 91-102,
       Nuclear Weapons System Safety Studies, Operational Safety Reviews and Safety Rules. If
       required, prepare and send Air Force Operational Report (AF OPREP-3) IAW AFI 10-
       206, Operational Reporting.
       4.1.3. (Added-AFMC) If the potential exists for full or partial unit decertification,
       AFMC Directorates or AFNWC will contact AFMC/A10 as early as possible to initiate
       the decertification process.
   4.2. A nuclear-capable unit must be decertified if it does not receive a Nuclear Weapons
   Technical Inspection (NWTI) IAW CJCSI 3263.05.
   4.3. The MAJCOM commander continues to be responsible for ensuring the safety and
   security of all nuclear assets during the interim period between decertification and
   recertification and must develop and implement mitigation measures that ensure safe, secure
   and reliable WR assets.
       4.3.1. (Added-AFMC) Full or partial unit decertification. AFMC/A10 will coordinate
       with applicable AFMC directorates (e.g., A4 for maintenance, A1 for PRP, A7 for
       security, etc) and supported units to assess the impact of full or partial unit decertification
       and discuss potential courses of action.
       4.3.2. (Added-AFMC) Courses of action may include, but are not limited to:
       restrictions on functions/tasks/personnel, external oversight, re-training teams, or
       personnel changes.
   4.4. Document decertification with a memorandum (Attachment 4) to include the following
   as a minimum:
       4.4.1. Unit decertified and the specific reason(s) for the decertification.
       4.4.2. Specific critical activities the unit is allowed to perform to ensure the safety and
       security of any nuclear assets under control of the unit. For example, continue to allow
       the Security Forces Squadron (SFS) to provide nuclear asset security, even though the
       SFS’s parent wing has been decertified.
       4.4.3. The decertification memorandum must provide relevant and unambiguous
       information to the unit and senior leadership on the specific reasons for decertification.
       The decertification memorandum must be written with sufficient detail and will be
       classified, marked and handled as appropriate.
