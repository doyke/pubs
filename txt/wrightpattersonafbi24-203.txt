      1.4.1. Ensure items received are not separated from their containers.
      1.4.2. Ensure, to the maximum extent possible, that serviceable items are issued to using

          the property.
      1.4.3. Ensure items received without the proper reusable container are afforded proper
      protection. Items will be stored with an AF Form 451 attached. Base Supply will not
      designate a reusable container storage area.

      without containers, then an AF Form 451 must be with the item. AF Forms 451 will be

2. Reimbursement Process:
   2.1. Using organizations will reimburse 88 MSG/LGR for all materials and labor used in
   connection with packaging services.
   2.2. The BCM will prepare a monthly summary of packaging service costs and forward to 88
   CPTS (Attachment 5).
3. Excess Reusable Containers:
   3.1. The BCM will participate in the Reusable Container Worldwide Warehouse (RECON).
   RECON is a tool that cross-levels excess reusable containers and/or packaging material from
   CONUS/OCONUS bases, provides worldwide visibility and matches war fighters’ reusable
   container needs.
   3.2. Use RECON to report excess serviceable non-specialized reusable containers (including
   containers for assets no longer on-hand) when the quantity or economic value justifies the
   cost of redistributing them. For unserviceable containers that are beyond economical repair,
   DRMO resell of non-usable excess for recycling is the preferred method of disposal.
   3.3. For disposition and redistribution in RECON, appropriate Transportation Account Code
   (TAC) will be assigned for CONUS/OCONUS (over ocean only) for transportation (shipping
   and handling) costs.

                    SEMIANNUAL REUSABLE CONTAINER REPORT

To measure program effectiveness and efficiency, the BCM will perform semiannual inspections
of organizational units’ reusable container storage areas. Report distribution will include
installation, group and applicable unit commanders, primary UCMs, and upon request,
appropriate MAJCOM agencies.
The semiannual report will include the following elements:
A2.1. Unit Reusable Container Monitor Training.
    A2.1.1. Number of UCMs appointed in last six months.
    A2.1.2. Number of UCMs trained within 60 days of appointment.
    A2.1.3. Total number of UCMs appointed.
    A2.1.4. Percent of all UCMs trained.
A2.2. Reusable Container Return Efficiency.
    A2.2.1. Number of AF Forms 451 submitted in last six months and the associated total cost
    for supplies and labor to provide/construct reusable containers.
    A2.2.2. Number of AF Forms 451 submitted due to loss/destruction of reusable containers
    (list unit responsible, item nomenclature and SPI number) and the associated cost to
    provide/construct reusable containers.
A2.3. Shipping Delays.
    A2.3.1. The objective of measuring shipping delays is to elevate program awareness by
    how the loss/destruction of reusable containers can impact the base mission.
    A2.3.2. To measure, AF Forms 451 will be annotated when the item is received and the date
    the item is packaged. The delay is the total days accrued between these dates.
A2.4. Reusable Container Storage and Conservation.
    A2.4.1. Number of unit reusable container storage areas inspected the last six months.
    A2.4.2. Percent of required inspections performed the last six months.
    A2.4.3. Unit reusable container storage areas not inspected (list unit and reason for not
    inspected).
    A2.4.4. Deficiencies identified during inspection (list date identified, category of deficiency,
    unit and status (open/closed)). Deficiencies will be categorized as Major or Minor.
       A2.4.4.1. Major deficiencies include: reusable containers discarded in waste/refuse
       receptacles; reusable containers susceptible to weather damage stored in location exposed
       to weather; reusable containers stored in manner which could damage reusable
       containers; evidence of improper opening/closing of reusable containers; reusable
       container components not stored with container for which designed; reusable containers
       used for other than intended purpose; reusable containers not stored in designated storage
       areas.

    housekeeping; storage area used for other than storing reusable containers.
