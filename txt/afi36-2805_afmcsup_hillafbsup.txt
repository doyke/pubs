each category. Board members assess an individual’s award selection potential by making an
evaluation of each nominee’s complete package. The following factors will be used to conduct

order the nominees by converting total nominee points to a nominee rank order standing.
Example: One board member’s overall scores for the three nominees who met the board were
27, 23, and 25. That board member would then rank order his/her nominees as follows: 1, 3,
and 2. There should be no ties once rank ordered.

tally sheet to the 75 ABW/CCC office the same day as the board is completed.

duty military award winners of the OO-ALC quarterly and annual awards by the OO-ALC

                         MILITARY EVALUATION GUIDELINES

A9.1. Selection: Selection will be based on the AF IMT 1206.

A9.2. Written Evaluation (AF IMT 1206) .

A10.2.1. Effective evaluation of the AF IMT 1206 requires a detailed thought process; it’s
challenging to review nomination packages and determine who are the ―Best of the Best.‖ Each
board member must remember, it’s not the writer, it’s the accomplishment of the nominee which
makes the difference. Strong emphasis must be on initiative, achievement, and impact, not
writing style.



A9.2.2. When evaluating an AF IMT 1206, the individual’s quarterly write-up cannot exceed 15
lines not including the three category headings (30 lines including the headings for annual) .
Any combination of lines can be used, however each category should have a minimum of two
lines. The total possible points that can be awarded are 25. There are only three approved
categories (listed below) that will be scored. Additionally, nomination submissions in excess of
the 15-line limit (27 for annual) will be scored by eliminating one line per heading, starting with
the Leadership and Job Performance area, until the maximum number of lines is reached. THis
process will be conducted from bottom to top. Each line will be evaluated on its own merit.
Board members have the opportunity to award maximum points to each section and can score
each category using whole or half point increments. Board members must break all ties and
cannot award points beyond the maximum points allocated for each category.



A9.2.2.1. Leadership and Job Performance: (maximum points – 15) .



A9.2.2.2. Significant Self-Improvement: (maximum points – 5) .



A9.2.2.3. Base/Community Involvement: (maximum points – 5) .

A9.3. Nomination Headings.

A9.3.1. Leadership and Job Performance: The individual’s primary duty accomplishments are
the most important element of the awards nomination package. This is the most difficult section
to score, because everyone does an outstanding job in his or her area of expertise. Below are
AFI 36-2805_AFMCSUP_HILLAFBSUP 23 JULY 2009                                                      11


guidelines to assist board members in differentiating the impact on the mission and leadership
role. (Maximum points – 15) .

A9.3.1.1. Innovative methods/programs developed, designed, implemented, and impact.

A9.3.1.2. Process Improvement – cost saving, percentage improved or reduced.

A9.3.1.6. Wing/company/command-level working group, committee chair/member, project
officer.

A9.3.1.7. Higher HQ, service unique, or DoD involvement (i.e. tests site, program, equipment,
etc.) .

A9.3.1.8. Wing/company/command-level and higher awards (both individual and unit) .

A9.3.2. Significant Self-Improvement: The primary focus of this section is the individual’s
professional and personal development and how it benefits the respective service. The key
factors to this category are: individual commitment level and personal sacrifice. You can judge
this by answering the following questions. How much time was expended? How much effort
was involved? Was the achievement done on duty or during off-duty time? (Maximum points –
5) .

A9.3.2.1. Off-duty Education- College (in-residence, on-line, correspondence classes, etc.) .

A9.3.2.2. Professional Military Education (specific progress, attendance or completion) .

A9.3.2.3. Upgrade Training (CDCs, formal training courses, etc.) .

A9.3.2.4. Advanced career field or Military Occupational Specialty training.

A9.3.2.5. Readiness training.

A9.3.2.6. Conference or symposiums related to job or career field/specialty (how nominee used
information to improve process, mission impact, etc.) .

A9.4. Scoring.

A9.4.1. Board members must utilize Hill AFB Form 551, Recognition Program Board Member
Score Sheet. Each nominee should be given a score within each of the three main areas
(headings) using full or half point increments. Board members will then annotate the overall
score for each nominee. Once all nominees have been given an overall score, the board member
should rank order the nominees with the highest overall score receiving the lowest (best)
ranking. For example, overall scores of 27, 23, and 25 would be rank ordered as 1, 3, and 2.
Upon rank ordering, the board member must sign and date the form and provide the score sheet
to the board president as requested.

A9.4.2. The board president will utilize Hill AFB Form 552, Recognition Board President Tally
Sheet, to determine the rank order of nominees gathered from the board members' score sheets.
For example, Nominee X was given a ranking of 1, 2, and 2 by the board members, while
Nominee Y was given a ranking of 2, 1, and 1. Nominee X's overall score would be 5 while
Nominee Y's would be 4. Nominee Y would be ranked 1 (best) and Nominee X would be
ranked 2.

A9.4.3. In event of a tie after board member scoring and ranking, the board president's scores
will be utilized to break the tie. In the end, no ties are acceptable.
