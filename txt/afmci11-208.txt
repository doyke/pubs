                                            Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL GUIDANCE

1.1. General. This MAJCOM instruction governs the performance of AFMC aviation support
for military or public events held for community relations or ceremonial purposes. The purpose
is to provide installation and wing commanders the appropriate guidance for successful aerial
event execution. HQ AFMC/A3 may task AFMC units to provide assets to participate in certain
key public or military events, both for the Air Force and AFMC.
1.2. Goal. The goal of this instruction is to provide guidance not found in other Air Force
Instructions (AFIs) or Air Force Materiel Command Instructions (AFMCIs) and to bring
disparate information and guidance into a single location.
1.3. Public Event. Public events are community relations events not connected with the
military functioning of the Department of Defense (DoD) and intended primarily for non-
military audiences. These events may be on- or off-base; continental United States (CONUS) or
outside of the continental United States (OCONUS). Public events can be sponsored by either
DoD or non-DoD organizations and can be good community relations and recruiting
opportunities.
1.4. Military Event. A military event is an official DoD event, sponsored by the DoD, a DoD
Component, or a command conducted in support of an assigned mission, including purposes of
esprit de corps, primarily for military personnel, civil service personnel, dependents, and limited
guests. The event must be hosted on a facility owned, leased or operated by the DoD. In the
event a judgment needs to be made on whether an event is a military or public event, contact
HQ AFMC/PA who will assist in the determination. For funeral flyovers, see paragraph 3.2.
1.5. Aviation Support for Public or Military Events. AFMC supports several aerial events
unique to our MAJCOM, often with the highest visibility across the Air Force. Aviation support
to any event requires proper prior planning and coordination to ensure success. In addition to
this MAJCOM Instruction, the requirements of AFI 11-209, AFMC Sup 1, Aerial Event Policy
and Procedures, AFI 35-105, Community Relations, as well as AFI 10-1004, Conducting Air
Force Open Houses still apply and must be met.
1.6. Approvals. Units still must comply with all appropriate guidance regarding aerial event
participation. Questions on any aspect of staffing an aerial event package should be directed to
HQ AFMC/A3OA as early as possible to allow for proper coordination. Units should have
Center Commander approval prior to submitting a package for MAJCOM approval. As a
minimum, allow 45 days for staffing a package through the MAJCOM staff and Air Staff.
1.7. Other Guidance. Any unit tasked with planning an upcoming aerial event should contact
HQ AFMC/A3OA early in the process to enable HQ AFMC to provide support and guidance in a
timely manner. Any unit participating in any aerial event should always annotate their intent to
support on SAF/PAâ€™s website: www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil.
AFMCI11-208 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                        3


                                            Chapter 2

                                     RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. HQ AFMC/A3. The Director of Air, Space and Information Operations is the execution
authority for many aerial events across the command. Approvals for having an event and for
participation have not changed. All personnel associated with an aerial event are to refer to
AFI 11-209, AFMC Sup 1, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures, to ensure proper processes are
followed.
2.2. HQ AFMC/PA. The purpose of Public Affairs (PA) operations is to communicate timely,
accurate, and useful information about Air Force activities to DoD, Air Force, and domestic and
international audiences. Some of those activities include aerial events. HQ AFMC/PA is the
starting point for approval authority for all AFMC aerial events. SAF/PA is the approval
authority for all Air Force aviation public event requests. All personnel associated with an aerial
event are directed to cross-check who the final approval authority is in AFI 11-209, AFMC Sup
1, Aerial Event Policy and Procedures, and/or AFI 35-103, Public Affairs Travel.
2.3. AFMC Host Units.
   2.3.1. The Host Unit on all AFMC bases is the responsible organization for planning and
   conducting public and military events. This could be an Air Base Wing (ABW), Air Base
   Group (ABG), or an active flying wing. All Host Units are reminded that adherence to AFI
   10-1004, Conducting Air Force Open Houses, is paramount.
   2.3.2. It is highly suggested that each Host Unit consider designating an individual to be the
   POC every year for their public or military event, preferably a civil servant in the grade of
   GS-13. As resources become tighter every fiscal year, this should assist in providing more
   continuity. This individual should consider attending The International Council of Air
   Shows (ICAS) annually, if budgets will allow.
   2.3.3. The ICAS convention is normally held yearly in December allowing open house
   directors/staff an opportunity for face-to-face interaction with the performers and the annual
   schedules of the DoD demonstration teams are announced to the public. More information
   about ICAS is available at its website, http://www.airshows.aero/ and the ICAS publication,
   Air Show Manual.
Note: Reference to ICAS or their products does not imply an endorsement by the Air Force. Any
interaction with this organization is optional. POs and NFEs involved with the open house
should be involved in the early planning stages.
2.4. AFMC Flying Units. All Airmen that participate in aerial events are to ensure they
thoroughly understand the requirements of AFI 11-209, AFMC Sup 1, Aerial Event Policy and
Procedures, AFI 10-1004, Conducting Air Force Open Houses, and how to prepare packages for
Exceptions to Policy (ETPs). All questions should be directed to HQ AFMC/A3O; send an
email to HQ AFMC/A3 Workflow at HQAFMC.A3.Workflow@wpafb.af.mil.

                                              Chapter 3

                          AFMC SUPPORT TO AIR FORCE EVENTS

3.1. Aerial Events Message. Every calendar year, the Air Staff publishes an aerial events
message. This message breaks aerial events down into three types of events, Category I, II, and
III.
     3.1.1. Category I Events. Category I events are those events where AF/A3O-O will task
     the responsible lead MAJCOM to support an event NLT 30 days prior to the event if
     volunteer support is not available. Authorized level of support is up to 4 aircraft of same
     type making one pass (MAJCOMs will determine the appropriate level and type of support
     for an event). Each event has a lead MAJCOM designated to arrange the flyover details.
     The lead MAJCOM is responsible for supporting the event unless there are volunteers from
     other MAJCOMs or the NGB. If another MAJCOM or NGB volunteers to support the event,
     they assume responsibility as lead MAJCOM for the event. MAJCOMs will not be asked or
     tasked to provide flyover support for events during the hours of darkness (before the start of
     morning civil twilight or after the end of evening civil twilight). All events still require a
     formal request (via DD Form 2535 to SAF/PA) before support efforts are initiated. For listed
     Category I events, lead MAJCOMs will provide their plan to support (to include aerial
     control team, when necessary) to AF/A3O-O NLT 1 month prior to the event. Units are to
     ensure they have a copy of the Aerial Events Message once published by the Air Staff. The
     following are examples of Category I events from a prior year:
        3.1.1.1. Monster Jam World Finals, NV: 28 MAR 09 (ACC lead MAJCOM)
        3.1.1.2. Coca-Cola 600, NC: 25 MAY 09 (AETC lead MAJCOM)
        3.1.1.3. Indy 500, IN: 25 MAY 09 (AMC lead MAJCOM)
        3.1.1.4. Pennsylvania 500, PA: 2 AUG 09 (AFMC lead MAJCOM)
     3.1.2. Category II Events. Category II events are events that are supported by volunteer
     units and are not typically tasked. The authorized level of support is up to four aircraft of the
     same type making one pass. Typical events units may volunteer for include:
        3.1.2.1. National Football League (2 Home games max per team during regular season).
        3.1.2.2. Major League Baseball (4 Home games max per team during regular season).
        3.1.2.3. College Football (1 Home game max per team during regular season;
        Military/ROTC appreciation only)
     3.1.3. Category III Events. Category III events are those events that are not found in the
     Category I or II list of the annual message. They are supported by volunteer units and are not
     typically tasked. These events are limited to 1 flyover max per location. The authorized
     level of support will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Eligibility will be based upon
     the overall benefit to the Air Force, the level of local Air Force participation and recruiting
     involvement, crowd size, media coverage, and the opportunity to display the Air Force
     message. Events that do not meet this criteria will not be eligible for support. Sporting
     events not listed in Category I or II and not directly tied to local community relations will not
     be considered eligible.
AFMCI11-208 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                      5


3.2. Funeral Flyovers. Every Monday, AF/A3O-O, through AFWATCH, sends an e-mail that
solicits volunteers for funeral flyovers. Decedents are either eligible, or their family has been
granted an ETP by AF/A3O-O. Eligibility criteria for funeral flyovers are listed in AFI 11-209,
Aerial Event Policy and Procedures. If a funeral flyover is located near an AFMC base, the
AFMC base can be directed by the Air Staff to support the funeral flyover if there is not a
volunteer.
3.3. Air Force Marathon. The Air Force Marathon is an official Air Force event that takes
place on Wright-Patterson AFB. The Air Staff will task a MAJCOM to support the event. The
Air Force Marathon Office will work with the tasked MAJCOM to choose the featured aircraft.
This aircraft will appear on the medal presented to finishers of the races.
   3.3.1. AFMC flying units (Edwards, Eglin, and Holloman) will be tasked to support as
   necessary.
   3.3.2. HQ AFMC/A3O will participate as a member of the committee that selects the feature
   aircraft.

                                             Chapter 4

                            AFMC SUPPORT TO AFMC TATTOO

4.1. AFMC Freedomâ€™s Call TATTOO. The AFMC Commander has directed an AFMC
TATTOO be conducted annually at Wright-Patterson AFB. This open house is the premier
aerial event for the local Wright-Patterson AFB community.
4.2. Event Planning. Normally, most bases have an active duty flying unit that develops and
executes that baseâ€™s open house event. An active duty flying unit is not located at Wright-
Patterson AFB, therefore, the 88 ABW is responsible for planning and executing the annual
AFMC Freedomâ€™s Call TATTOO. The OPR for TATTOO in HQ AFMC is HQ AFMC/A3.
     4.2.1. The 88 OSS/CS serves as the AFMC TATTO Director and is the OPR for the WPAFB
     AFMC TATTOO Event Plan. The plan will be updated on an annual basis, and it will reside
     with other wing plans in the 88 ABW Plans and Programs Division.
     4.2.2. HQ AFMC/CS, in collaboration with the 88 ABW/CC, oversees the organization,
     planning, and execution of the AFMC TATTOO.
     4.2.3. AFMC TATTOO Executive Committee. Oversight group comprised of HQ
     AFMC/CS, 88 ABW/CC, and the AFMC TATTOO Director.
     4.2.4. All AFMC flying units (Test Wings) should expect to be tasked for aerial support to
     the AFMC TATTOO and plan their flying hour program accordingly.
        4.2.4.1. Aerial support requirements will take test schedules into consideration when
        selecting specific aircraft types for TATTOO participation.
        4.2.4.2. Other MAJCOMs will be requested to support the AFMC TATTOO on a
        volunteer basis.
4.3. Event Support/Execution.
     4.3.1. The TATTOO is executed by the 88 ABW through the WPAFB AFMC TATTOO
     Event Plan.
        4.3.1.1. The 88 ABW is responsible for executing the entire AFMC TATTOO event, to
        include all operations and logistics support required for military aircraft, any participating
        civilian aircraft, music and other ground celebrations.
        4.3.1.2. Details will be indicated in the plan and nearly all Wright-Patterson AFB support
        organizations will be tasked to support through the specific unit/agency responsibilities
        and support requirements as identified in the TATTOO Plan.
        4.3.1.3. HQ AFMC organizations should reference the 88 ABW TATTOO Plan for
        complete understanding of how each organization in HQ AFMC interacts with 88 ABW
        units in support of the AFMC TATTOO.
AFMCI11-208 6 AUGUST 2012                                                                    7

                                   AFMC BASE EVENTS

5.1. Open Houses. All AFMC bases are encouraged to host an open house when operations
tempo and resources allow. Final discretion ultimately rests with the installation commander or
his/her delegated authority. AFMC flying units can expect to support each otherâ€™s events as
necessary.
5.2. Military Events. These are events that are only open to military members, civilian
workforce and support contractors and their families. As in open houses, AFMC flying units can
expect to support these events as well.
5.3. Event Plans. Each AFMC base will keep plans up to date and on file with their Intallation
Host Unit or ABW Plans shop (usually designated XP), or equivalent.
5.4. Event Execution. The installation commander approves the event staff. The event staff
acts on the commanderâ€™s behalf to plan and execute the event. AFI 10-1004, Conducting Air
Force Open Houses, gives a comprehensive review of guidance and procedures for planning and
executing an Air Force open house. The military event is essentially the same as an open house,
but not open to the public. Considerations for an open house are essentially the same for a
baseonly event, the scale is just smaller.
5.5. Final Approvals. All packages for staffing through the AFMC staff are required to be
submitted 45 days prior to the event. Send packages to the HQ AFMC/A3 Workflow at
5.6. Other Guidance.
   5.6.1. Flying wing commanders are expected to manage their allotted proficiency flying time
   to ensure they are able to support AFMC events.
   5.6.2. Events requiring any Exception-To-Policy (ETP) should be staffed to HQ
   AFMC/A3O NLT 60 days prior to the event. This is to ensure enough time to staff the
   package forward to SAF/PA NLT 45 days prior to the event. If there are questions or
   concerns, contact HQ AFMC/A3O.

         NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE EVENTS

6.1. General. The National Museum of the United States Air Force (NMUSAF) is located at
Wright-Patterson AFB, and is operated by the U.S. Air Force under the operational control of
AFMC. This museum is the largest and oldest military aviation museum in the world. More
than a million visitors annually experience a century of aviation history in multiple galleries that
connect the Wright Brothers' enduring legacy with today's technology. The NMUSAF collects,
researches, conserves, interprets and presents the Air Forceâ€™s history, heritage and traditions, as
well as todayâ€™s mission to fly, fight and win ... in Air, Space and Cyberspace to a global audience
through engaging exhibits, educational outreach, special programs and the stewardship of the
national historical collection.
6.2. World War I (WWI) Dawn Patrol Fly-In and Vintage Liaison Aircraft
Gathering. The NMUSAF, as part of their educational objective, hosts the WWI Dawn Patrol
fly-in and the Vintage Liaison Aircraft Gathering. This multi-day event features heritage WWI
vintage aircraft or vintage Liaison aircraft, radio-controlled aircraft, and antique military
vehicles. The WWI Dawn Patrol occurs in odd-numbered years and the Vintage Liaison Aircraft
Gathering occurs in even-numbered years.
     6.2.1. The NMUSAF is responsible for planning, coordinating, staffing, and general
     management of both events. The NMUSAF Director will ensure a copy of both plans are
     updated as necessary and kept on file in the museum offices.
     6.2.2. HQ AFMC/A3O will support the NMUSAF by reviewing and coordinating event
     plans for approval by the AFMC Director of Air, Space and Information Operations
     (AFMC/A3). These plans must be submitted NLT 45 days prior to the event.
     6.2.3. 88 ABW agencies are tasked to support this event within the scope of their functions.
6.3. NMUSAF Aircraft Inductions. The NMUSAF runway (09/27) is a closed runway and is
opened only for special events and aircraft inductions into the NMUSAF. Runway opening
requires the approval of HQ AFMC/A3 and this authority cannot be delegated. Packages for
HQ AFMC/A3 approval to open the runway are required to be submitted NLT 45 days prior.
