                                             Chapter 1

              GENERAL CONCEPTS, POLICIES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Concept of the AF OPREP-3 System. The AF OPREP-3 system provides Chief of Staff
Air Force (CSAF) and intermediate commanders the information necessary for timely
operational decisions. The main criteria for inclusion in the AF OPREP-3 system is essential
information for command and control of aerospace forces.
1.1. (AFSPC)Concept of the AF OPREP-3 System. Concept of the AFSPC Commander’s
Critical Information Requirements (CCIR) System. The AFSPC CCIR system provides the
Commander of AFSPC, and selected key staff, the information necessary for timely operational
decisions. CCIRs are used to report events or incidents, which do not meet Air Force-level
operational reporting criteria, but are of interest to the Commander of AFSPC. The main
criterion for inclusion in the AFSPC CCIR system is the immediate requirement for essential
information to make timely operational decisions for command and control of cyberspace and
space forces.
     1.1.1. MAJCOM, FOA, and DRUs will not establish AF OPREP-3 report rules or instruction
     below Headquarters Air Force (HAF) level (i.e., Homelines.); but instead may develop
     MAJCOM/FOA/DRU/Commander Critical Information Requirements (CCIR) in order to
     ensure events/incidents that do not meet AF OPREP-3 reporting requirements are still
     available to the commander.
     1.1.1. (AFSPC) With the exception of asynchronous reporting, AFSPC CCIR reporting will
     mirror AF OPREP-3 reporting procedures (i.e., subject line, timing, matrix use, synchronous
     reporting, etc.), but will not be transmitted outside AFSPC channels, unless otherwise
     directed.
     1.1.2. Due to the time sensitivity of AF OPREP-3 information, report each event/incident as
     promptly and accurately as possible. The FIRST command post (CP) having knowledge of
     an event/incident will report/facilitate AF OPREP-3 reporting. Units will not delay
     submission of an AF OPREP-3 to research if another unit is also submitting the report. In the
     case of multiple AF OPREP-3 submissions; the AFSWC will decide if multiple units will
     continue submitting or if one unit will continue all Follow Up reporting based on information
     received.
     1.1.3. MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs are authorized to supplement this AFI with
     concurrence from AF/A3O on an AF Form 673, Air Force Publication/Form Action Request.
     Units at all levels will develop procedures to quickly obtain and report the key elements of an
     AF OPREP-3 report. Installations hosting units assigned to different MAJCOMs will
     develop host/tenant responsibilities in a Host Tenant Support Agreement (HTSA) and/or
     Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). Each affected MAJCOM will coordinate on the MOA
     and review annually or as mission changes dictate. Geographically Separated Units (GSUs)
     will comply with parent MAJCOM guidance IAW this instruction.
     1.1.4. Air Force component commanders within combatant commands, Joint Bases (JB) or
     Joint Task Forces (JTF) will develop written guidance to ensure compliance with this
AFI10-206_AFSPCSUP_I 1 MAY 2013                                                              7


   instruction within their command and de-conflict with combatant, JB, or JTF command
   directives.
   1.1.5. Authority. This instruction includes the requirements of the various documents of the
   Joint Reporting Structure (JRS). Air Force units will use AFI 10-206 as the primary source
   for reporting instructions.
1.2. Responsibilities
   1.2.1. HQ USAF AF/A3O will:
       1.2.1.1. Develop and provide Air Force operational reporting guidance.
       1.2.1.2. Annually, review new requirements to determine operational necessity.
       1.2.1.3. Update the AF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix as directed by the commander
       AF/A3O.
       1.2.1.4. Develop HAF Core Compliance criteria/checklist to be used to evaluate
       compliance with published directives.
   1.2.2. HQ USAF A3O-AOA will:
       1.2.2.1. Monitor and process information from Jabber and SKIWeb.
       1.2.2.2. Distribute data to requesting HAF Leadership.
   1.2.3. MAJCOMs, DRUs, and FOAs will:
       1.2.3.1. Develop instructions to ensure timely and accurate AF OPREP-3s are reported
       within established timelines IAW Table 3.1.
       1.2.3.2. Review new requirements annually to determine operational necessity.
       1.2.3.3. (Added-AFSPC) HQ AFSPC/A3OP will:

     1.3.3. Installations operating with multiple MAJCOMs. Tenant commanders assigned to a
     different MAJCOM than the host unit, have the sole responsibility to report an event/incident
     affecting their assets that meet AF OPREP-3 reporting criteria through the host CP. When
     submitting a report for the tenant, the host CP will not interfere with, alter, or delay the tenant
     unit's report. Air Mobility Control Center (AMCC) commanders will ensure that all
     BEELINE and PINNACLE reports are submitted to the host/installation commander for
     upchanneling. A memorandum of agreement between the host and tenant wings with
     concurrence of the parent MAJCOMs is required.

                  EVENT/INCIDENT REPORT (AF OPREP-3 REPORT)

3.1. Subject and Purpose. Air Force Commanders use AF OPREP-3s to immediately notify
higher headquarters of any significant event or incident that rises to the level of DoD, CJCS,
COCOM, or Service Level interests. Command post will submit the applicable AF OPREP-3
regardless of whether or not the event is being reported through other channels. AF OPREP-3
reports do not replace the requirement for more detailed reports such as the Commander's
Situation Report (SITREP), and other directorate’s accident or incident investigation reports.
Submitting an AF OPREP-3 report does not change nor is it a substitute for any report required
by other directives. Real-world AF OPREP-3 reports take priority over exercise events.
3.2. Reporting Categories. CJCSM 3150.03D, Joint Reporting Structure Event and Incident
Reports, categorizes events or incidents according to their nature with a FLAGWORD.
FLAGWORDs (i.e., NUCFLASH, BENTSPEAR, etc.) associated with each category aid prompt
processing and distribution of the reports by alerting people to their importance. The following
FLAGWORDs identify reports within the CJCSM 3150.03D.
   3.2.1. PINNACLE (OPREP-3P). This report is used by any unit to provide the National
   Military Command Center (NMCC) and, as appropriate, combatant commands and services
   with immediate notification of any incident or event where national or international level
   interest is indicated. OPREP-3P reports are not restricted to operational information. Any
   inadvertent, accidental, unauthorized, or unexpected event or incident will be upgraded from
   an AF OPREP-3B to an AF OPREP-3P if:
       3.2.1.1. The occurrence is of such impact that it requires the immediate attention of the
       Secretary of Defense and the CJCS. Included are those occurrences that have actual or
       potential international repercussions, such as the creation of tension or undesirable
       relations between the United States and other countries.
       3.2.1.2. The occurrence has national-level interest that may significantly change current
       operations, or involve natural or human-made disasters or civil disorders.
       3.2.1.3. It is conceivable that the incident will cause the highest levels of government to
       require timely notification.
       3.2.1.4. Any doubt exists at any level as to whether an event or incident is or could
       possibly develop into a matter of White House, DOD, Joint Service, or major news
       media.
   3.2.2. PINNACLE NUCFLASH (OPREP-3PNF). Used to report an event, accident, or
   incident that could create the risk of a nuclear war. This report has the highest precedence in
   the OPREP-3 reporting structure. Report any of the following as an OPREP-3PNF if:
       3.2.2.1. Ballistic missile launch or space launch.
       3.2.2.2. Reentering space objects.
       3.2.2.3. Loss, potential loss, or degradation of US military space capability when the loss
       or degradation is because of actions by a suspected or known hostile source.
AFI10-206_AFSPCSUP_I 1 MAY 2013                                                             15


     3.2.2.4. Reports of cruise missiles detected and/or launched against the US or US
     interests.
     3.2.2.5. Accidental, unauthorized, or unexplained incident involving possible detonation
             of a nuclear weapon producing a nuclear yield.
     3.2.2.6. Unauthorized flight or deviation from an approved flight plan, by a US nuclear-
     armed or nuclear-capable aircraft with the capability to penetrate the airspace of another
     nuclear-capable country.
  3.2.3. PINNACLE FRONT BURNER (OPREP-3PFB). Used to report pre-conflict
  occurrence of armed attack, harassment, or hostile action against US forces, territory, or
  interests. After the OPREP-3PFB has been submitted for a specific hostile situation,
  subsequent OPREP-3P reports are not required. To report significant mission degradation or
  heavy losses, combat events and minor airfield damage will be reported in the SITREP.
  3.2.4. PINNACLE BROKEN ARROW (OPREP-3PBA). Used to report a US nuclear
  weapon accident that does not create the risk of a nuclear war. Report any of the following
  as an OPREP-3PBA if:
     3.2.4.1. Nuclear detonation of a U.S. nuclear weapon.
     3.2.4.2. Non-nuclear detonation or burning of a U.S. nuclear weapon.
     3.2.4.3. Radioactive contamination from a U.S. nuclear weapon or component.
     3.2.4.4. Jettisoning of a U.S. nuclear weapon or component.
     3.2.4.5. Public hazard, actual or implied, from a U.S. nuclear weapon or component.
  3.2.5. PINNACLE EMPTY QUIVER (OPREP-3PEQ). Used to report the seizure, theft, or
  loss of a U.S. nuclear weapon.

  operations involving the command disablement or nonviolent disablement of U.S. nuclear
  weapons.
  3.2.7. PINNACLE EMERGENCY EVACUATION (OPREP-3PEV).                          Used to report
  operations involving the emergency evacuation of U.S. nuclear weapons.
  3.2.8. OPREP-3 WHITE PINNACLE (OPREP-3WP). OPREP-3WP is used for exercise
  reports that contain simulated time-critical information from operating forces to the NMCC
  and combatant commanders. OPREP-3WP exercises use OPREP-3 procedures and is
  downward directed by the NMCC to check timeliness of select CPs and other designated
  Command and Control (C2) nodes.
     3.2.8.1. Combatant Commands designate the units to receive the exercise message and
     will select specific exercise start times. Upon receipt of an OPREP-3WP tasking, units
     are required to submit an OPREP-3WP acknowledgement report to the NMCC via
     synchronous (Jabber) means. The time standard is 20 Minutes.
     3.2.8.2. AF Command Posts units will transmit OPREP-3WP in the same fashion as AF
     OPREP-3P. Units will transmit an OPREP-3 WP IAW 3.2.8.3. to the “AF.Watch”
     Jabber room. Upon receipt, AFSWC controllers on duty will immediately turn the
     OPREP-3 WP to the NMCC “dod_njoic” Jabber room.

       3.2.8.3. OPREP-3 WP Message Content. The following will be included in the OPREP-
       3WP:
           3.2.8.3.1. Unit tasked to exercise OPREP-3WP
           3.2.8.3.2. Location (if not classified)
           3.2.8.3.3. Tasking COCOM
           3.2.8.3.4. DTG of the tasking message
           3.2.8.3.5. Unit time of receipt
           3.2.8.3.6. Acknowledgment addressing any known delays or initiative tracer actions
           (Note: Only applicable when acknowledgement exceeds 20 minute time standard).
   3.2.9. OPREP-3 BENT SPEAR (OPREP-3BS). Used to report incidents involving U.S.
   nuclear weapons that are of significant interest but are not categorized as PINNACLE
   NUCFLASH or PINNACLE BROKEN ARROW. CPs will submit BENT SPEAR reports
   using the same timing requirements as PINNACLEs.
   3.2.10. OPREP-3 FADED GIANT (OPREP-3FG). Used to report nuclear reactor or
   radiological accidents or incidents to the appropriate service headquarters. CPs will submit
   FADED GIANT reports using the same timing requirements as PINNACLEs.
3.2.11. DULL SWORD (DS). Used by any unit to report, in accordance with Service
guidelines, a nuclear weapon event not categorized as an accident or incident. The wing safety
office is responsible for making all DULL SWORD reports IAW AFMAN 91-221, Weapons
Safety Investigations and Reports.
   3.2.12. BEELINE (OPREP-3B). Used to report any event or incident that meets Air Force-
   level interest, but does not meet national or international level interest requirements.
   Although the report normally remains within USAF channels, BEELINE information is made
   available to agencies outside the USAF (NMCC, State Department, etc.) through
   asynchronous reporting.
   3.2.13. (Added-AFSPC) AFSPC CCIR. CCIR are used to report events or incidents, which
   do not meet Air Force-level criteria, but are of interest to the Commander of AFSPC.
   Submitting an AFSPC CCIR does not change, nor is it a substitute for any other report
   required (i.e., SITREP, OPREP-3, accident or incident investigation reports, etc.) or other
   directives. Real-world AFSPC CCIR reports take priority over exercise events.
3.3. Reports Guidebook. The Command Post NCOIC of Reports has the responsibility to
maintain the Reports Guidebook. This guide provides a quick reference to assist Command Post
controllers in submitting AF OPREP-3s and other reports, as applicable. The reports guidebook
will include:
   3.3.1. Current AF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix. The AF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix is a quick
   reference guide to assist commanders and controllers in determining the level/type of report
   to submit based on events and incidents deemed of interest to the CSAF and CJCS. Due to
   the need for reporting requirements to be updated as operational situations evolve and as
   A3O or higher directs; the AF OPREP-3 Reports Matrix will be posted on SKIWeb

   of Practice (CoP) webpage for AFSC 1C3s to access. CPs will be notified of changes
   (through CP channels) as they are directed.
   3.3.1. (AFSPC) AFSPC CCIR Matrix. The matrix is a reference guide used to assist in
   determining what incidents have been deemed of interest to the Commander of AFSPC and
   reportable to HQ AFSPC. The matrix will be posted to the Secure Internet Protocol Router
   Network (SIPRNet) Air Force Command Post Career Field Community of Practice (CoP)
   webpage and emailed to the 614 AOC and 624 OC. CPs will be notified of changes via
   AFSPC Command and Control Controller Information Files (C2CIFs).
   3.3.2. Contact Address List Attachment 2, Table A2.1. are the core recipients for all AF
   OPREP-3s. Attachment 2 has been provided to assist during times of system inoperability.
   Units will ensure that affected HQs receive the report, regardless of how the report is
   transmitted. During routine operations wings/units will select applicable HQs based on
   situation, chain of command (COCOM, MAJCOM, etc) as well as “Affected Areas” from the
   event/incident when adding an event into SKIWeb. AFSWC will be selected as an “Affected
   Area” in SKIWeb on all AF OPREP-3s. Units may add additional contact information to the
   Reports Guidebook as required.
   3.3.3. AF OPREP-3 Reports Guide. The AF OPREP-3 Reports Guide, Attachment 3, Figure
   A3.1. is a list of minimum routine questions that need to be answered when including data
   into an AF OPREP-3 report.
   3.3.4. Checklists containing step-by-step procedures to ensure required reports are submitted
   in the proper format, within established timelines, and with the correct content.
   3.3.4. (AFSPC) Unit AFSPC CCIR checklists will contain report upgrade and closure
   procedures.
3.4. AF OPREP-3 Report Timing Requirements. Wing/units will use Table 3.1. for
synchronous/asynchronous timing requirements. Where a qualified/certified specialist must be
consulted to determine if an AF OPREP-3 event/incident has occurred according to AF OPREP-
3 Reports Matrix requirements (i.e., weapons maintenance on a weapons outage, medical
provider for confirmation of death) timing standards will begin from CP notification of the
determination rather than incident (IAW Table 3.1). Justification for delay, as well as the time
the event initially occurred will be included in the report.

3.5. Synchronous Reports. Synchronous communication is defined as where all parties
involved in the communication are present at the same time (an event). Examples include a
telephone conversation, a chat room event and instant messaging. Units will submit a
synchronous report using SIPRNet Jabber for all AF OPREP-3 Initial, Follow Up, Final,
Correction, and Initial/Final reports. Do not delay the initial Jabber notification to obtain
additional information. The initial Jabber notification time will be the time inputted into the
system. Use Follow Up notifications and reporting to provide additional information as it
becomes available. AFSWC/MAJCOMs will assess unit reports for possible higher category
reporting requirements.
   3.5.1. Units submitting an AF OPREP-3 Jabber report will enter notifications into the
   “AF.Watch” room regardless of the type of report being reported: classification, title IAW
   para 3.10.5., whether the report is an Initial, Follow Up, Final, Initial/Final or Correction as
   well as a brief synopsis of information known, and in sentence case. See Figure 3.1. Jabber
   Notification Example.
   3.5.1. (AFSPC) AFSPC CCIR Synchronous Reporting. The 614 AOC will submit a
   synchronous report stating “AFSPC CCIR Rule X# is posted in SKIWeb” after asynchronous
   reporting. The unit Command Posts, and the 624 OC will submit synchronous reports for all
   Initial, Follow Up, Final, Initial/Final, and Corrected reports via Jabber into the
   “afspc_command_center ” room within 15 minutes from notification of the reportable event.
   Entries will be sentence case. AFSPC Jabber posts will be formatted the same as an AF
   OPREP-3 Jabber notification. See AFI 10-206, Figure 3.1, Jabber Notification Example. An
   example is: “(U//FOUO) AFSPC CCIR: DDHHMMZMONYYYY, Unit, Location, Rule
   Name, Rule Number”.
   3.5.2. Units submitting an Exercise AF OPREP-3 Jabber report will enter notifications into
   “AF.Exercise” room regardless of the type of report being reported: classification, title IAW
   para 3.10.5., whether the report is an Initial, Initial/Final, Follow Up or Final, as well as a
   brief synopsis of information known, and in sentence case. See Figure 3.1, Jabber
   Notification Example.
AFI10-206_AFSPCSUP_I 1 MAY 2013                                                                 19


Figure 3.1. Jabber Notification Example


   3.5.3. AFSWC and MAJCOM Command Centers will acknowledge wing/unit reports within
   5 minutes of the posting. Acknowledgement can be in any hierarchy order. In the event that
   a Higher Headquarters (HHQ) element does not acknowledge within 5 minutes; the wing/unit
   will contact their parent MAJCOM Command Center for assistance. HHQs will then provide
   acknowledgement through Jabber. AFSWC will always be the highest level of required
   acknowledgement regardless of report type.
3.6. Asynchronous Reports. Asynchronous communication does not require that all parties
involved in the communication need to be present and available at the same time. Examples of
this include e-mail (the receiver does not have to be logged on when the sender sends the e-mail
message), discussion boards, which allow conversations to evolve and community to develop
over a period of time. Units will submit an asynchronous report using SKIWeb for all Initial,
Follow Up, Final, Initial/Final, and Corrected AF OPREP-3 reports.
3.6. (AFSPC)Asynchronous Reports. AFSPC CCIR Asynchronous Reporting. The 614 AOC
will submit asynchronous reports for all Initial, Follow Up, Final, Initial/Final, and Corrected
report via SKIWeb. The unit Command Posts and 624 OC will submit asynchronous reports for
all Initial, Follow Up, Final, Initial/Final, and Corrected reports to the AFSPC Command Center
via Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and Secure Internet Protocol
Router Network (SIPRNet) email (consistent with the classification constraints) within one hour
from Jabber input or voice notification. If a unit requires an extension for Asynchronous
Reporting contact the AFSPC Command Center immediately for approval. The subject line will
be formatted the same as an AF OPREP-3 subject line. An example is: “(U//FOUO) AFSPC
CCIR: DDHHMMZMONYYYY, Unit, Location, Rule Name, Rule Number”.
   3.6.1. Reports will contain (as known at the time) the who, what, when, where, why, how,
   operational impact, media applicability, and other pertinent information of the event/incident
   being reported based on available information. Units will include any updated information
   gathered after the initial Jabber notification without exceeding the time criteria. Do not delay
   asynchronous reporting to obtain additional information.
   3.6.2. All efforts should be made to ensure AFSWC has acknowledged Jabber notifications
   prior to posting in SKIWeb, and that all questions from any HHQs has been answered.
   3.6.3. AFSWC/MAJCOMs will assess unit reports for possible higher category reporting
   requirements.
   3.6.4. The primary means for transmitting AF OPREP-3 reports is via asynchronous means.
   When primary means are unavailable, transmit AF OPREP-3 reports by the fastest means
   available consistent with security constraints IAW Para 3.11.
   3.6.5. Ensure reports containing classified or special intelligence information are marked
   properly.
   3.6.6. If not answered in the Initial record report, Follow Up reporting will continue until all
   of the following questions are answered: who, what, when, where, why, and how as the
   information becomes available.
 20                                                     AFI10-206_AFSPCSUP_I 1 MAY 2013


   3.6.7. If seven calendar days have elapsed from the Initial report and these questions are not
   answered, a Final AF OPREP-3 report will be submitted stating that “No further information
   will be provided through AF OPREP-3 channels.” Identify approved points of contact
   (POC), agency(ies), and contact number(s).
   3.6.7. (AFSPC) If seven calendar days have elapsed from the Initial report and these
   questions are not answered, a Final AFSPC CCIR report will be submitted stating that “No
   further information will be provided through AFSPC CCIR channels.” Identify approved
   points of contact (POC), agency(ies), and contact number(s).
3.7. MINIMIZE. Submission of AF OPREP-3 reports will not be affected by MINIMIZE.
3.7. (AFSPC)MINIMIZE. Submission of AFSPC CCIR reports will not be affected by
MINIMIZE.
3.8. Appropriate Report Content. While the narrative section of each report must clearly
convey the details of the incident, reports will not be personally identifiable to an individual. To
ensure anonymity reports may contain:
   3.8.1. Age, gender, duty status (e.g., active duty, ARC (whether on orders or not) ), rank (if
   applicable), DoD civilian status, and assigned unit/agency.
   3.8.2. If HHQ requires names/social security number (SSN), they will request it as an
   addendum separate from AF OPREP-3 report. Only the last 4 digits of the SSN will be
   provided.
   3.8.3. Name, title, and phone number of safety board president for aircraft accidents.
   3.8.4. Name of a public figure whose death occurs on an Air Force installation.
   3.8.5. Name of a deceased retired AF VIP (i.e. flag officer or CMSAF).
   3.8.6. Aircraft type, tail number, owning unit, aircrew unit and squadron, type mission, and
   mission number for all reports involving Air Force owned, contracted, or operated aircraft.
   3.8.7. Name and telephone number for Civilian Personnel Section point of contact for
   civilian deaths.
3.9. Inappropriate Report Content. Although the narrative section of each report must clearly
convey the details of the incident, it will not include:
   3.9.1. Any speculation regarding responsibility, failure of equipment or facilities, legal
   liability, or causes.
   3.9.2. Quotations or opinions from witnesses or other privileged sources.
   3.9.3. Use of personal information to include name (see exceptions above), SSN, or home
   address.
3.10. Asynchronous Report Construction: Initial, Initial/Final, Follow Up, Final, and
Corrected Reports.
   3.10.1. Initial reports contain as much information as immediately available within
   established time parameters about an event or incident. Initial reports will be submitted IAW
   para 3.5. Upon acknowledgement from the AFSWC, the AF OPREP-3 will then be posted
   into SKIWeb by selecting “Add an Event” feature. AF OPREP-3s will be in sentence case.
AFI10-206_AFSPCSUP_I 1 MAY 2013                                                                21


  An Initial Report may be submitted as an Initial/Final report if it contains all of the required
  information to close the report. Initial/Final reports will be submitted IAW para 3.10.6.4.
  3.10.2. Follow Up reports are essential to keep commanders informed of developing
  situations and to provide additional details as they are learned. Follow Up reports will be
  submitted IAW para 3.5. Upon acknowledgement from the AFSWC, the AF OPREP-3 will
  then be posted into SKIWeb by selecting the “Add a Blog” feature. AF OPREP-3s will be in
  sentence case.
  3.10.3. Final reports will provide required information not previously reported and close
  event/incident reporting.    Final reports will be submitted IAW para 3.5.          Upon
  acknowledgement from the AFSWC, the AF OPREP-3 will be entered into SKIWeb by
  selecting the “Add a Blog” feature. AF OPREP-3s will be in sentence case. Final reports
  will be submitted IAW para 3.10.6.4.
  3.10.4. SKIWeb Corrected reports will be sent when factual data needs to be corrected.
  Corrected reports will be entered into SKIWeb by selecting the “Add a Blog” feature. AF
  OPREP-3 Corrected reports will be in sentence case. The first line of the corrected report
  will state “Correction to AF OPREP-3 B/P DDMMHHZMMMYYYY report”. Retyping the
  report is not the intent. Include only corrected information, but enough to aid the reader in
  understanding what was corrected.
  3.10.5. AF OPREP-3 Message Subject Line. Regardless of transmission medium, all AF
  OPREP-3 subject lines will be constructed in the following manner:
  3.10.5.1. Service Affiliation.
     3.10.5.2. Type of Report (OPREP-3P, OPREP-3PFB, OPREP-3B, etc.).
     3.10.5.3. DTG and Location Event Occurred. This time will not change as subsequent
     reports are added.
     3.10.5.4. Event/Incident and Rule Number.
     3.10.5.5. As an example:       AF OPREP-3B, 132000ZMay2010, Andrews AFB, MD,
     Aircraft Mishap, Rule 2B.
  3.10.6. Reports body will be written to the following standard:
     3.10.6.1. The first AF OPREP-3 record copy report will include the time the
     event/incident occurred in the beginning of the report.
     3.10.6.2. The body of the report narrative will include the who, what, when, where, why,
     and how of the incident. In the initial report, report what is known at the time. Include
     new information as details unfold. In subsequent reports, do not restate previously stated
     facts.
     3.10.6.3. The statement “Further reporting through XXX channels.” will only be used
     after consulting and confirming with the appropriate external agency(ies) that further
     reports will be accomplished through their channels, include agency office symbol and
     contact number. This statement will not be used as a blanket statement.
     3.10.6.4. All Final reports will end with the applicable statement, “No further
     information will be provided through AF OPREP-3 channels.” as well as add the word
 22                                                   AFI10-206_AFSPCSUP_I 1 MAY 2013


      “Closed” at the end of the subject line. To edit the subject line, use the “Edit Event”
      feature.
      3.10.6.5. Information requested by AFSWC (or HHQ element) during synchronous
      reporting will be provided in an asynchronous report when the information becomes
      available. Reports are not authorized to be closed prior to answering questions from the
      asking HHQ element.
      3.10.6.5. (AFSPC) Information requested by AFSPC Command Center during
      synchronous reporting for AFSPC CCIR will be provided in an asynchronous report
      when the information becomes available.
      3.10.6.6. When events/incidents occur which overlap multiple rule numbers, units will
      combine them and submit one OPREP-3. If multiple rule numbers specify different types
      of OPREPs, i.e. BEELINE, PINNACLE, units will submit the highest type report. For
      AF OPREPs with multiple rule numbers, only one rule number and title will be reflected
      in the subject line; use the initial events rule number that resulted in the multiple event
      occurring. For example use 9K, Bomb Threat in the subject line for the following
      scenario: Bomb Threat; FPCON Change; Death, Air Force Member; Criminal Activity
      (News Media).        Additional rule numbers will be reflected at the bottom of
      synchronous/asynchronous (i.e., Rules XX, XX and XX also apply.)
      3.10.6.7. Upgrading Reports. Units will upgrade AF OPREP-3 reports if Follow Up
      information to an event/incident meets the criteria of a higher-level report (e.g.,
      BEELINE to PINNACLE). In the upgraded Initial Report, provide all previously
      reported information and known facts even if previously reported to a lower level.
      Upgrading a report automatically closes any lower level reports previously submitted by
      the wings/units. Units will make a Jabber notification stating the previous subject line
      from the lower level report has been upgraded along with the reason (cost estimate,
      media attention, etc.) Upgraded AF OPREP-3 reports will be blogged in SKiWeb, and
      the subject line updated to reflect the change.
      3.10.6.8. United States Military Text Formatting (USMTF). In the event that both
      synchronous/asynchronous mediums are inoperable and the AF OPREP-3 meets
      PINNACLE criteria, wings/units will submit the PINNACLE in USMTF format IAW
      para 3.11.2. BEELINE reports will remain in plain text regardless of system operability
      and will be sent IAW para 3.11.1.
3.11. Synchronous/Asynchronous Outages.
   3.11.1. BEELINE:

                             CRESCENT EDGE (OPREP-3CE)

7.1. Used to immediately notify the Joint Staff, or Air Force, of significant activities
involving Special Access Programs (SAPs) operating IAW AFI 16-701, Special Access
Programs (SAP). Affected unit CPs will submit voice reports through normal CP channels. The
flag words BEELINE and PINNACLE are used to reference the SAP management level to be
contacted. Regardless of the SAP management level, AFSWC will address SAF/AAZ (Air
Force Special Access Program Central Office). MAJCOMs will establish procedures for
contacting program managers at and below the MAJCOM level.
7.1. (AFSPC)Used to immediately notify the Joint Staff or Air Force of significant
activities involving Special Access Programs (SAPs) operating IAW AFI 16-701, Special
Access Programs (SAP). AFSPC SAP programs (Offensive Space Control [OSC] and Cyber
Warfare [CW]) units are responsible for reporting incidents to HHQ which meet OPREP-3CE
criteria.
   7.1.1. The AF OPREP-3CE report allows units operating SAPs to use the operational
   reporting channel to advise their program managers of events or incidents that meet AF
   OPREP-3 reporting criteria. The AF OPREP-3CE report is the single reporting channel for
   all SAP units reporting incidents to HHQ. An AF OPREP-3CE report will be submitted
   when an authorized individual from the unit has determined an event or incident involving a
   SAP warrants higher-level awareness. AF OPREP-3CE reports will be forwarded through
   CP channels to MAJCOM Command Centers and the AFSWC.
   7.1.2. The unit with the SAP, not the CP, initiates AF OPREP-3CE reporting. The initiating
   unit will notify the CP of an AF OPREP-3CE report to be submitted. No program names or
   incident details are included and CP personnel will not press for details. The CP will send
   the report up the chain to the appropriate level. It is the reporting unit’s responsibility, to
   determine the level of report to provide all information. After report submission CP
   performs no other action.
   7.1.2. (AFSPC) Units which are tenants on non-AFSPC installations will initiate OPREP-
   3CE reporting through the host installation command post.
   7.1.3. AF OPREP-3CE will not be reported via synchronous/asynchronous means.
      7.1.3.1. CPs will upchannel AF OPREP-3CE through voice conference with MAJCOM
      and AFSWC, only including the information listed in para 7.2.
      7.1.3.1. (AFSPC) CPs will transmit AF OPREP-3CE via SECURE communications.
      The primary means of communication between the unit and command post is secure
      voice. When secure communications cannot be established, units may pass voice reports
      via non-secure communications. However, the use of secure communications is directed
      in situations where OPSEC is of utmost concern and/or the mere acknowledgement of an
      OPREP-3CE exposes potential sensitive SAP activities.
      7.1.3.2. CPs will transmit a narrative email via NIPRNet/SIPRNet (based on
      classification) to their MAJCOM Command Center and AFSWC. At the request of the
AFI10-206_AFSPCSUP_I 1 MAY 2013                                                          35


      SAP Manager, AFSWC will notify NMCC of the report providing only the information
      listed in para 7.2.
7.2. Only the following information will be included in the AF OPREP-3CE voice and hard
copy report:
   7.2.1. The time the unit initiates the report.
   7.2.2. The name, phone number, and office symbol of the person at the unit initiating the
   report.
   7.2.3. The name, phone number, and office symbol of the program manager at the
   appropriate higher headquarters.

warrant Air Force or Joint level attention. Incidents are not limited to NIPRNet-connected
computers; other stand-alone systems could be affected. While the Air Force’s formal incident
Handling Program is centralized within 24AF as the Air Force’s Computer Network Defense
Service Provider (CNDSP), this does not preclude a commander’s authority to release AF
OPREP-3s for activity affecting their command or causing operational impact prior to 24AF’s
formal declaration that an event or activity is an incident IAW CJCSM 6510.01A.
8.2. As the Air Force's service component to USCYBERCOM, AFCYBER (24AF) is
responsible for the operation and defense of the Air Force-provisioned portion of the
Global Information Grid (AF-GIG). They will normally be the first to detect or be the first to
be notified by external entities of cyber intrusions, attacks, or outages on the AF-GIG. 24AF is
responsible for the operation and defense of the AF-GIG and will normally be the first to detect
or be the first notified by external entities of cyber intrusions or attacks on the AF-GIG through
the 624th Operations Center (OC). 624OC has the responsibility, on behalf of 24AF, to
telephonically notify all affected installations of cyber intrusions or attacks.
   8.2.1. If 624OC first discovers or is first notified of cyber intrusion/attack or incident
   affecting multiple installations, MAJCOMs, or the AF-GIG, the 624OC/CC will notify the
   AFSPC Command Center of a potential AF OPREP-3 requirement and provide them with
   pertinent information.
   8.2.2. If an installation is notified by 24AF/CC or the 624OC of a confirmed outage,
   intrusion, attack, or incident the affected unit will notify the Commander, servicing
   Communications Squadron/Flight/Communications Focal Point (CFP), and servicing CP.
   The Installation Commander will make a determination if the incident meets AF OPREP-3
   criteria.
   8.2.3. If an installation is the first to   discover a cyber outage, intrusion, attack, or incident,
   the affected unit will notify their          Commander, servicing Communications Squadron,
   servicing CP and report the event            IAW AFI 33-138, Enterprise Network Operations
   Notification and Tracking, Chap 5.            The Commander will make a determination if the
   incident meets AF OPREP-3 criteria.
AFI10-206_AFSPCSUP_I 1 MAY 2013                                                            37


     8.2.3.1. (Added-AFSPC) If an AFSPC unit or installation is the first to discover a cyber
     outage, intrusion, attack, or incident, the affected unit will notify their Commander and
     servicing Communications Squadron, and report the event IAW AFI 33-138, Enterprise
     Network Operations Notification and Tracking, Chap 5. In coordination with the 624
     OC, the Commander will make a determination if the incident meets AF OPREP-3
     criteria.
