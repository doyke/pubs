    1.10. AMU Weapons will:
       1.10.1. Supervise accountability efforts and management of munitions on the flightline.
       These processes will strive to meet the Air Force goal to the maximum extent possible
       after last aircraft of each go has landed.
       1.10.2. Use CAS to manage munitions upload, download, cross-load and expenditure
       data.
       1.10.3. Perform munitions reconciliation after aircraft Go. Make every effort to process
       expenditure information in CAS as aircraft activity occurs throughout the flying day. As
       a minimum, process required transactions between aircraft Go’s.
       1.10.4. Ensure munitions are only loaded on aircraft scheduled to fly in support of the
       printed weekly flying schedule. As a general rule, these do not require downloading if
       aircraft is scheduled to fly within three consecutive flying days. 20mm ammunition may
       remain loaded unless aircraft is required for maintenance/serviceability inspections, or as
       directed by Munitions Flight.
       1.10.5. Document Attachment 20mm ammunition upload and download on load sheet
       ().

       UALS/LALS and jam trailer to Armament Flight (366 EMS/MXMR) for ammunition
       download.
       1.10.7. Request munitions from Munitions Control NLT 6-hours prior to aircraft take-off
       time for heavy bombs and 20mm ammunition, and NLT 3-hours prior to aircraft take-off
       for CATMs, BDU-33s and countermeasures, based on weekly flying schedule.
       Coordinate flying schedule changes IAW the MHAFB Supplement to ACCI 21-165.
       1.10.8. Annotate and attach an AFTO Form 350, Reparable Item Tag, (Attachment 4),
       to broken or suspect munitions, including training missiles, chaff/flare modules,
       cartridges from hung bombs and 20mm ammunition downloaded into M548 containers
       (one tag per can).
       1.10.9. Coordinate TMU-72 argon coolant tank servicing with Munitions Control. To
       extent possible, exchange coolant tanks in quantities of 12 each.
       1.10.10. Complete AF IMT 2434 with munitions currently loaded and expended on each
       aircraft after each Go. Send AF IMT 2434 to Munitions Control via fax, email or hard
       copy as soon as possible after each aircraft Go, but NLT 2-hours after engine shut down.
       The AF IMT 2434 will include cross-country or TDY aircraft. Note: It is essential
       during TDY tasking that expenditures and carry-forward munitions are tracked via AF
       IMT 2434. If no munitions personnel are TDY, turn AF IMT 2434 into Munitions
       Control the first duty day after aircraft return. Munitions will not be released for the next
       flying day until the AF IMT 2434 has been received and reconciliation is complete.
       1.10.11. Ensure munitions are not delivered to unattended location/aircraft. Exceptions
       must be approved by Munitions Flight Supervision.
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI21-201 6 MAY 2013                                                               9

      suspended and/or one-time inspection of munitions, to include download, upload or
      cross-load as required.
      1.10.14. Ensure munitions, trailer chocks and other accessories are secured IAW TO 11-
      1-38 or approved local guidance, prior to requesting movement of trailers. Munitions
      personnel will not hook up or move trailers unless/until munitions are properly
      configured and secured, and AFTO Form(s) 350 are attached if required.
      1.10.15. Provide Munitions Flight with necessary parts required to maintain and repair
      chaff/flare modules assigned to each AMU.
      1.10.16. Inventory safing gear, protective caps, BDU-33 safing blocks (C-blocks) and
      expended impulse cartridges and report shortages to Munitions Control. When munitions
      are expended, provide safing gear, protective caps, C-blocks and expended impulse
      cartridges to Line Delivery drivers. In the event of lost safing gear, protective caps, C-
      blocks and expended impulse cartridges, a lost tool/item report must be generated before
      like munitions or replacement safing gear are delivered.
      1.10.17. Ensure all 20-flight missiles are downloaded for inspection as coordinated by
      Munitions Control. Weather delays or hangar aircraft preventing missile downloads will
      be taken into consideration for rescheduling of 20-flight downloads.
      1.10.18. Download all countermeasures the first Friday of every month or as directed by
      Munitions Control to ensure inventory accuracy, as well as, enable consolidation of

          1.10.21.1. Capture munitions data on the AF IMT 2434 and ensure timely delivery to
          Munitions Control for processing in CAS.
2. Daily Reconciliation of Munitions:
   2.1. Reconciliation is a 2-part process that includes reporting and validating expenditures, as
   well as, accounting for/turn-in of safing gear and expendables; e.g., safing blocks, expended
   impulse cartridges, buffers, umbilical covers, etc., or any other accountable safing gear.
   2.2. Reporting the expenditures of munitions aircraft should occur in near- real time to the
   maximum extent possible, striving to meet the Air Force goal of 1 hour to the maximum
   extent possible after the landing of the last aircraft from each Go
   2.3. Weapons Expediters will account for and turn-in safing gear and expendables to Line
   Delivery between aircraft Goes after processing expenditures in CAS.
 10                                               MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI21-201 6 MAY 2013


   2.4. Weapons Expediters will calculate total expenditures by aircraft and annotate them on
   the AF IMT 2434, based on munitions loaded on each aircraft before take-off compared to
   munitions remaining after each Go. Expenditures will then be processed in CAS by weapons
   expediters (excluding countermeasures and 20mm ammunition)
   2.5. Munitions personnel will utilize completed AF IMT 2434 to validate expenditures
   during reconciliation, excluding countermeasures and 20mm.
   2.6. Once all munitions have been accounted for by aircraft and expenditures are processed
   in CAS, consider reconciliation complete.
   2.7. If discrepancies exist, refer to 1.5.5 for resolution.
   2.8. Aircraft that did not expend munitions or fly, and are configured correctly for
   subsequent sorties based on the printed weekly flying schedule, or a coordinated AF Form
   2407, do not require download if aircraft is scheduled to fly within 3 consecutive flying days.
   2.9. Reconciliation is to be conducted by Munitions personnel and Weapons Expediters.
       2.9.1. Munitions Control–DSN: 728-6221/1686, Comm: (208) 828-6221/1686

3. Argon Procedures:
   3.1. Line Delivery or PGM personnel will ensure charged TMU-72 coolant tanks are
   provided to AMUs as required.
   3.2. AMUs will validate “actual vs. indicated pressure” IAW Attachment 5, Coolant
   Pressure Tank Temperature/Pressure Variation, before returning coolant tanks for recharge.
   This action is the result of temperatures below 80 degrees F, the coolant tank “indicated
   pressure” decreases as temperature decline, thus delivering a pressure reading that is less than
   actual pressure present.
   3.3. Exchange coolant tanks with each AMU on a one-for-one basis.
   3.4. Return damaged coolant tanks to PGM element, with a properly filled out AFTO Form
   350 (Attachment 3) for replacement.
   3.5. Line Delivery personnel will deliver charged/properly packed containers of TMU-72
   coolant tanks to flight line expediters.

   until disposition is received from the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) personnel.
5. Management of Impulse Cartridges:
   5.1. For daily flying operations, Munitions Flight will deliver ARD impulse cartridges with
   bombs scheduled for expenditure.
   5.2. In the event of a hung bomb, the following procedures will occur:
      5.2.1. AMU Weapons personnel will segregate the expended/unserviceable impulse
      cartridge, notify Munitions Control immediately, and annotate and attach an AFTO Form
      350 (Attachment 4).
      5.2.2. Munitions Control will dispatch Line Delivery to pick up impulse cartridges with
      proper documentation for delivery to Conventional Maintenance.
      5.2.3. Conventional Maintenance will determine serviceability of impulse cartridge. If
      cause was not due to human/aircraft error, submit an Ammunition Disposition Request
      (ADR). If cause was human/aircraft error, expend impulse cartridge against the
      appropriate AMU or return serviceable cartridge to service.
      5.2.4. Munitions Control will not expend impulse cartridge identified as a malfunction
      and will follow-up with AMU Weapons personnel as to the cause and report findings to
      Munitions Supervision, Operations, Conventional Maintenance and 366 MXG/Load
      Standardization.
   5.3. During exercise/contingency operations, Munitions Flight will mass issue impulse
   cartridges to AMU weapons section(s).

   custody accounts and manage them IAW MHAFBI 21-203.
6. Emergency Issue:
   6.1. An emergency issue is an unforeseen requirement preventing a unit from performing its
   mission when the munitions item is to be installed or consumed within 12 hours of issue.
   Custodians must obtain approval for an emergency issue request, signed by the requesting
   unit’s flight chief or designated representative. However, in cases of competing priorities,
   approval requests will be justified and approved, in writing, by the 366 MXG/CC or
   designated representative. Approval memorandum must contain:
      6.1.1. Reason for emergency condition.
      6.1.2. Aircraft tail number (applies only to Cartridge Actuated Device/Propellant

   account (FV4897) or issued to custody accounts and tracked in CAS. Munitions Operations
   will notify custodians with shelf/service life assets on their account which are approaching
   expiration to turn in assets. Using organizations will then file an issue request with
   Munitions Operations for replacement items.
   7.2. Shelf/service life items issued to Due-In from Maintenance (DIFM) accounts for time
   change are consumption issued (removed) from CAS at time of issue. Therefore, it is the
   using organization’s responsibility to track shelf/service life IAW applicable technical data.
   When items require turn-in due to service life expiration, using organizations will request
   replacement items using issue request/turn-in procedures.
8. Forecasting and Disposition Requirements:
   8.1. Forecasts should not be straight-line unless mission requirements will remain the same
   for the entire 5-year forecast period. Requirements should consider the mission for each
   independent year and should stand alone. Forecasts must capture unit needs based on the
   overall fiscal year (FY) requirements.
   8.2. Submit forecasts to Munitions Operations within the specified timeframe using the
   Agile Munitions Support tool (AMST). This timeframe is determined when instructions are
   received from MAJCOM. All forecasts must be submitted using valid authorization sourced
   from the Ground Munitions Authorization Table in AMST or other valid source (i.e. T.O. or
   AFI).
