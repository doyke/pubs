     Medical Group Commander. Determine locally whether reports warrant attention above the
     medical commander. However, the Mission Support Group Commander must be informed
     of chronic and repeat discrepancies, and the Wing Commander must be aware of issues that
     could impact the mission.
     3.1.6. Send unsatisfactory reports on contractor-operated, AAFES, or DeCA facilities to the
     contracting authority, HQ AAFES, or HQ DeCA, respectively.
3.2. Public Facilities:
     3.2.1. If the facility received an unsatisfactory rating, a re-inspection must be accomplished
     within 24 hours. If the facility received a marginal rating, then a re-inspection must be
     accomplished within 5 days. Discuss all discrepancies and write-ups with the facility
     manager or person in charge.
     3.2.2. Send unsatisfactory ratings to the Aeromedical commander (or equivalent) and to the
     Medical Group Commander. Determine locally whether reports warrant attention above the
     Medical Group Commander. However, the Mission Support Group Commander must be
     informed of chronic and repeat discrepancies, and the Wing Commander must be aware of
     issues that could impact the mission.
