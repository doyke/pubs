ifies responsibilities, and establishes an annual requirement of 1 October to submit AF IMT 1075, Casu-

port for contingency operation (PERSCO), and casualty augmentation support team (CAST) members.

terrorist acts, will be released to the installation public affairs office. Deletes the requirement to report
newsworthy events. Standardizes reporting procedures for members who are very seriously ill or injured
(VSI), seriously ill or injured (SI), or who have an incapacitating illness or injury (III) for both overseas

responsibilities and procedures. Adds new addresses to Table 2.1. Deletes the requirement for HQ AFPC/
DPFCS to send condolence mailgrams to the next of kin (NOK) who were either present when the casu-
alty occurred or notified by a source other than Air Force. Implements the requirements of Title 10,
U.S.C., Chapter 76, Sections 1501-1513, Missing Persons, and DoDI 2310.5, Accounting for Missing

ber Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (FSGLI), and Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI), and

dents and survivors of active duty Air Force casualties; and benefits for dependents and survivors of

        2.4.1.1. If a GSU or PERSCO Team does not have electronic message capability, report the infor-
        mation by telephone to the servicing MPF, who then submits the required Casualty Report.
     2.4.2. The CAR at the member's servicing MPF submits a supplemental report completing all
     unknown or unconfirmed information, or items to be supplemented from the member's records within
     4 hours of receiving the initial Casualty Report.

2.5. Reporting Casualties on Members of Other Services (see Table 1.1., Table 2.2., and Table 2.3.):
     2.5.1. Follow the format for Air Force Casualty Reports and report all applicable items.
     2.5.2. Precede each item by its plain text title so the member's Service, which may not follow the
     same procedures, can understand the data. Do not use abbreviations.

2.6. Reporting Casualties on Foreign Nationals in the United States under the Auspices of the Air
Force:
     2.6.1. The reporting installation includes the orders-issuing headquarters of the appropriate nation’s
     military as an action addressee. If the foreign casualty is assigned as part of the Personnel Exchange

      appearance.
      2.7.1.2. The CAR must account for all personnel aboard the aircraft.
      2.7.1.3. The proper reporting method depends on the nature of the incident and the number of
      casualties. In all incidents, immediately contact HQ AFPC/DPFCS by telephone (DSN 665-3505
      or 1-800-433-0048), if possible, to determine which of these methods to use:
          2.7.1.3.1. If the casualties are all NSI, report them immediately by telephone followed by an
          abbreviated Casualty Report (Attachment 13).
          2.7.1.3.2. If there are multiple casualties, make an initial report by telephone and follow it
          with an abbreviated Casualty Report or a standard report as HQ AFPC/DPFCS directs.
          2.7.1.3.3. If telephone contact with HQ AFPC/DPFCS cannot be made, the MPF commander
          or PERSCO team chief determines whether to use an abbreviated or standard Casualty Report
          for initial reporting.
   2.7.2. Determining onboard crew and passengers. These documents and sources can help you deter-
   mine onboard personnel:
      2.7.2.1. Crew: Review DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan. It shows the name, grade, SSN, crew
      position, and home installation of each crewmember.

          2.7.2.2.1. Review available passenger manifests and other documentation from flight origina-
          tion and stops en route. These contain information such as passengers' names, grades, SSNs,
          passport numbers, emergency addresses, and units of assignment.
          2.7.2.2.2. Consult passenger service terminals, base operations, flight control centers at civil-
          ian airports, and AMC Aerial Port Operations offices for information on passengers aboard
          military aircraft.

            2.7.2.2.3. If difficulties are encountered in obtaining the information, immediately contact
            HQ AFPC/DPFCS by telephone (DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048) and they will request
            assistance from HQ AMC Tanker Airlift Control Center, Aerial Port Control Center (HQ
            AMC TACC/XOGC) (DSN 576-1755).
     2.7.3. Release of Casualty Information: Installation commanders must be able to determine casualty
     statuses. Crew and passenger names, and any other information that would assist commanders in mak-
     ing casualty determinations, will be immediately released to the CAR.

2.8. Reporting Casualties on DoD and DAF Civilian Employees. (See Table 1.1., note 18; Table 2.2.,
and Table 2.3.)

Section 2B—Reports on Deceased Persons

2.9. Obtaining Conclusive Evidence of Death.
     2.9.1. The installation commander or the on-scene commander must obtain conclusive evidence
     before reporting the death of an individual.
     2.9.2. If more than one commander or Service is involved, they must coordinate their investigations
     and agree on their casualty status determinations:
        2.9.2.1. Do not submit a Casualty Report until all involved commanders agree on their determina-
        tions.
        2.9.2.2. If the commanders cannot reach an agreement, consult HQ AFPC/DPFCS (DSN
        665-3505) for instructions.
     2.9.3. The Air Force does not require recovery of remains for conclusive evidence of death, since sit-
     uations will arise where remains cannot be recovered, but where the chance of survival is deemed
     impossible. The important factor is whether or not the commanders determine that survival is possi-
     ble.
        2.9.3.1. The Air Force considers these situations to be conclusive evidence of death:
            2.9.3.1.1. The commander determines death is the only plausible explanation for the mem-
            ber’s absence.
            2.9.3.1.2. Available information indicates beyond any reasonable doubt that an individual
            could not have survived. Such information includes:
                2.9.3.1.2.1. Statements of witnesses to the incident.
                2.9.3.1.2.2. Circumstances of the incident.
                2.9.3.1.2.3. Search results.
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                    39


              2.9.3.1.2.4. Local conditions of terrain, climate, water temperature and currents, etc.
           2.9.3.1.3. The total number of individual remains recovered from an aircraft or group accident
           equals the total number of persons known to be on board the aircraft or in the group, unless
           there is reasonable doubt:
              2.9.3.1.3.1. As to whether the remains are from the aircraft or group in question.
              2.9.3.1.3.2. Regarding the validity of the aircraft clearance and passenger manifest
              records.

2.10. Local Laws Governing Brain Death. The CAR must be aware of local laws governing brain
death, as they differ among states and countries. Submit death reports in accordance with the local legal
definition of brain death.

Section 2C—Reports on Members Declared DUSTWUN or Persons Declared Missing (Non-Hostile
and Hostile)

2.11. Declaring a Member DUSTWUN.
   2.11.1. DUSTWUN is a transitory casualty status applicable only to military personnel.
   2.11.2. The responsible commander declares a member DUSTWUN when the commander:
       2.11.2.1. Suspects a member's absence is involuntary and that the member may be a casualty.
       2.11.2.2. Does not feel there is sufficient evidence to make a definitive determination of missing
       (non-hostile), recommendation of missing (hostile), or deceased. DUSTWUN allows the com-
       mander time to gather additional facts and statements from witnesses in order to make a definitive
       status determination (non-hostile), or recommendation of missing (hostile).
   2.11.3. Once a commander declares a military member DUSTWUN, the CAR submits an initial
   DUSTWUN Report (see paragraph 2.14. and Attachment 3) to the addressees in Table 2.1. or Table
   2.2..
   2.11.4. Generally, commanders may not keep a member in DUSTWUN status for more than 10 days,
   unless extended by HQ AFPC/DPFC (DSN 665-2909). During this period, the commander:
       2.11.4.1. Closely monitors the case and makes every effort to determine the member's true status.
       2.11.4.2. Receives the results of any search and investigative efforts.
       2.11.4.3. Submits daily Search Progress Reports (see paragraph 2.15. and Attachment 4) to the
       addressees in Table 2.1. or Table 2.2..

2.12. Factors Commanders Should Consider to Determine Whether a Member's Absence is Volun-
tary or Involuntary.
   2.12.1. Member’s relationship with others both on and off duty:
       2.12.1.1. Marital discord.
       2.12.1.2. Problems with supervisors or coworkers.
   2.12.2. Financial activities prior to or subsequent to disappearance:
40                                                        AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


        2.12.2.1. Recent large withdrawals from bank accounts.
        2.12.2.2. Use of credit cards for airline tickets, hotels, or gas.
     2.12.3. Evidence of departure preparations:
        2.12.3.1. Luggage or personal belongings missing from the member's residence.
        2.12.3.2. Remarks made by the member to friends, relatives, or coworkers hinting at the possibil-
        ity of a departure.

2.13. Examples of When it May be Appropriate to Declare a Member DUSTWUN.
     2.13.1. An aircraft is overdue and the responsible commander has made an initial investigation, to
     include the following, with negative results:
        2.13.1.1. Checks of scheduled stops along route.
        2.13.1.2. Possible emergency landing sites.
        2.13.1.3. Other places the aircraft may have landed.
     2.13.2. A member disappears while participating in a recreational activity such as hunting, fishing,
     hiking, or camping:
        2.13.2.1. The member's commander initiates a search for the absent member and investigates the
        circumstances surrounding the member’s disappearance.
            2.13.2.1.1. The search must be sufficiently extensive for the commander to determine
            whether the member could freely return.
            2.13.2.1.2. Include Security Forces, local police, Air Force Office of Special Investigations
            (AFOSI), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other investigative agencies.
     2.13.3. Initial attempts to find the member fail and the commander determines the member is not
     AWOL.
     2.13.4. A member observes a lead aircraft as it is hit by enemy ground fire. Before the aircraft hits the
     ground, the member observes a flash, possibly from a seat ejection. Hostilities preclude launching a
     search and rescue attempt.
     2.13.5. A member disappears and there are no known circumstances:
        2.13.5.1. Personal belongings such as military ID card, wallet, car keys, checkbook, passport,
        camera, television set, savings bonds, etc., are still in member’s dormitory room or private resi-
        dence.
        2.13.5.2. First sergeant, supervisor and co-workers believe voluntary absence would be out of
        character for the member.

2.14. CAR Responsibilities for Filing DUSTWUN and Subsequent Reports.
     2.14.1. Once a commander declares a military member DUSTWUN:
        2.14.1.1. Immediately telephone HQ AFPC/DPFCS at DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048
        (CONUS bases only) and advise them of the commander’s decision.

            Military Control (RMC) Report (see Attachment 5) to all addressees on the initial DUST-
            WUN Report.

2.15. Search Progress Reports on DUSTWUN Members (RCS: HAF-DP[AR]9476, Missing Per-
sons Reports).
     2.15.1. The responsible commander orders a search and investigation for all DUSTWUN situations:
        2.15.1.1. Acceptable search and rescue methods include visual aerial search, ground teams, and
        electronic search.
        2.15.1.2. Electronic monitoring by aircraft flying in the area on other than search and rescue mis-
        sions is not an acceptable search method.

      2.14.

2.16. Declaring a Person Missing (Non-Hostile).
   2.16.1. This casualty status applies to both military members and civilian personnel.
   2.16.2. When a commander determines that a person's absence is involuntary and there is insufficient
   evidence to declare the person deceased, the commander:
      2.16.2.1. Consults with HQ AFPC/DPFCM by telephone at DSN 665-3752 or 1-800-531-5501
      prior to declaring a person missing or submitting a Missing Report.
      2.16.2.2. After consulting with HQ AFPC/DPFCM, declares the person missing (see Attachment
      1, Terms), and has the CAR submit an initial Missing Report (see paragraph 2.17. and Attach-
      ment 3).
   2.16.3. Declaring a military member missing (non-hostile) automatically invokes the statutory provi-
   sions of 37 U.S.C, chapter 10 (Payments to Missing Persons).
      2.16.3.1. Once the commander declares a person missing and notifies the NOK, HQ AFPC/
      DPFCM must issue any further official correspondence to the NOK, including notifications of a
      change in casualty status to deceased. NOTE: The CAR continues to provide casualty assistance
      to the NOK as described in paragraph 4.5.5.
   2.16.4. The commander must submit AF IMT 484, Non-Hostile Missing Person(s) Supplementary
   Report (see paragraphs 2.18. and 2.19., and Attachment 6), directly to HQ AFPC/DPFCM, and one
   copy to the CAR within 5 calendar days from the date he or she:
      2.16.4.1. Declares the person missing.
      2.16.4.2. Terminates the search for the person.

2.17. CAR Responsibilities for Filing Missing and Subsequent Reports (Non-Hostile).
   2.17.1. When the commander declares a person missing, the CAR:
      2.17.1.1. Immediately telephones HQ AFPC/DPFCS at DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048
      (CONUS bases only) and advises them of the commander’s decision.
      2.17.1.2. Submits an initial Missing Report (RCS: DD-FM&P[AR] 1664, Report of Casualty) on
      those persons indicated in Table 1.1. (see Attachment 3).

     2.17.2. Submit daily Search Progress Reports (see paragraph 2.21., and Attachment 4).
     2.17.3. Immediately notify HQ AFPC/DPFCM by telephone at DSN 665-3752 or 1-800-531-5501 if
     any of these situations develop after submission of an initial Missing Report:
        2.17.3.1. New information:
            2.17.3.1.1. If additional information surfaces that might help HQ AFPC/DPFCM determine
            the person's casualty status:
               2.17.3.1.1.1. Submit a supplemental Missing Report (see Attachment 3).

               2.17.3.1.1.4. Describe in item G of the report, the circumstances and factors that justify a
               supplemental report. For example, if the reporting unit learns that a member is categorized
               as missing in action and has been captured, it submits a supplemental Missing Report so
               HQ AFPC/DPFCM can change the casualty category from missing in action to captured.
            2.17.3.1.2. HQ AFPC/DPFCM notifies the NOK as appropriate.
        2.17.3.2. If the commander learns of a missing person being RMC, immediately contact AFPC/
        DPFCM by telephone at DSN 665-3752.
            2.17.3.2.1. Once notification to HQ AFPC/DPFCM has been made, submit an RMC Report
            (see Attachment 5) to all addressees on the initial Missing Report.
            2.17.3.2.2. HQ AFPC/DPFCM notifies the NOK.
        2.17.3.3. AWOL Message:
            2.17.3.3.1. If the commander decides the person's absence is voluntary, revoke the missing
            status with a message to all addressees on the initial Missing Report.

            2.17.3.3.8. See AFI 36-2911. for military members, and Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 630,
            Absence and Leave, for civilian personnel, for further guidance.
        2.17.3.4. Death Report (RCS: DD FM&P[AR]1664, Report of Casualty):
            2.17.3.4.1. If the commander determines a missing person is dead, submit an Initial Death
            Report (see Attachment 2) including all addressees on the initial Missing Report.

          tigated the circumstances surrounding the death in accordance with this AFI and has deter-
          mined that there is conclusive evidence of death.
          2.17.3.4.5. Submission of the report does not automatically change the person's casualty sta-
          tus from missing to deceased. The Missing Persons Act requires a formal status review:
          2.17.3.4.6. Only HQ AFPC/DPFCM may officially change the casualty status to deceased.

HAF-DP(AR)9476, Missing Persons Reports). If there is no change to a missing person’s casualty sta-
tus within 8 months, the commander concludes the investigation by submitting a 9-month Investigative
Report (see Attachment 8 and Attachment 9) following these guidelines:
     2.20.1. Submits a written report in non-hostile situations.
     2.20.2. The report must arrive at HQ AFPC/DPFCM before the end of the 9th month.
     2.20.3. Attachment 8 explains the contents of the 9-month Investigative Report.
     2.20.4. The report is an integral part of the casualty file used in the formal status review process.
     2.20.5. The review recommends, effective 1 year and 1 day from the date of the initial Missing

   2.21.3. Once the search is terminated, the responsible commander:
       2.21.3.1. Evaluates all available evidence.
       2.21.3.2. Ensures the CAR submits the appropriate Casualty Report IAW paragraph 2.17. or 2.22.

2.22. Declaring a Person Missing (Hostile).
   2.22.1. This casualty status applies to military members, DoD civilian employees, or DoD contractor
   employees.
   2.22.2. In those circumstances where the reason for a member’s absence is uncertain and it is possible
   that the member is a casualty whose absence is involuntary, but there is not sufficient evidence to
   determine immediately that the member is missing or deceased, the member should be designated
   DUSTWUN (paragraphs 2.11. through 2.15.) and the commander shall:
       2.22.2.1. Make a preliminary assessment of the circumstances. In circumstances where it is ques-
       tionable whether the involuntary absence is a result of hostile action (or under circumstances sug-
       gesting that the involuntary absence is a result of hostile action), the commander of the unit,
       facility, or area to or in which the person is assigned shall submit a preliminary assessment and
       recommendation.
       2.22.2.2. If, as a result of that assessment, the commander concludes that the person is missing,
       the commander shall:
           2.22.2.2.1. Recommend that the person be placed in a missing status using DD Form 2812,
           Commander’s Preliminary Assessment and Recommendation Regarding Missing Per-
           son (see DoDI 2310.5, Enclosure 3).
           2.22.2.2.2. Not later than 10 days after receiving such information, transmit a report contain-
           ing that recommendation to HQ AFPC/DPFCM with an advisory copy to the theater compo-
           nent commander having jurisdiction over the missing person.
   2.22.3. Upon receipt of the commander’s recommendation to place a person in missing status, HQ
   AFPC/DPFCM will notify the convening authority (AFPC/CC) who will appoint a board of inquiry in
   accordance with DoDI 2310.5 and AFPCI 36-26, Boards of Inquiry for Personnel Missing Under
   Hostile Conditions.

        2.29.1.2. The commander or head of the MTF must concur and approve the attending physician’s
        request on AF Form 570, Notification of Patient’s Medical Status, prior to HQ AFPC/DPFCS

        must be included on the AF Form 570.
     2.29.2. Family members eligible for Emergency Family Member Travel:
        2.29.2.1. The member’s spouse.
        2.29.2.2. The member’s children, including step, adopted, and illegitimate children where pater-

        and the location of the MTF in which the member is hospitalized; for personally procured com-
        mercial transportation such as airfare or driving expenses for travel by privately owned vehicle
        (POV).
            2.29.3.1.1. If family members are already at the member’s bedside, the Air Force does not
            offer transportation to other NOK unless the attending physician determines that these family
            members are physically or mentally incapacitated and are unable to contribute to the mem-
            ber’s health and welfare.
        2.29.3.2. Local per diem is authorized to pay for expenses such as food, lodging while in the

            2.29.3.2.1. Advance payments of per diem is authorized.
        2.29.3.3. It is extremely important to all concerned that care is taken when discussing any
        round-trip transportation with family members. To avoid embarrassing situations, do not obligate
        the Air Force before securing Emergency Family Member Travel approval and ensuring with HQ
        AFPC/DPFCS that family members meet all eligibility requirements.
     2.29.4. Responsibilities and procedures. It takes the coordinated effort of medical personnel, unit

          2.29.4.5.1. Ensures the Emergency Family Member Travel request meets public law require-
          ments and authorizes Emergency Family Member Travel. NOTE: Due to varied locations of
          family members and the extreme urgency of the situation, “message orders” from HQ AFPC/

Section 2E—Abbreviated/Hasty Casualty/Incident Reports (RCS: DD FM&P[AR]1664, Report of
Casualty)

2.30. Purpose.
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                 53


   2.30.1. The abbreviated/HASTY Casualty/Incident Reports (see Attachment 12 and Attachment
   13) are used to expedite the flow of casualty information to HQ AFPC/DPFCS when multiple casual-
   ties are involved and submitting standard Casualty Reports would delay notifying the NOK.
   2.30.2. The abbreviated/HASTY Casualty Reports are used to:
      2.30.2.1. Give HQ AFPC/DPFCS information for casualty accountability purposes.
      2.30.2.2. Help HQ AFPC/DPFCS expedite notification without news media interference.
      2.30.2.3. Provide immediate information about an incident with potential mass casualties.

2.31. Reporting Requirements and Procedures.
   2.31.1. If possible, the CAR contacts HQ AFPC/DPFCS by telephone at DSN 665-3505 or
   1-800-433-0048 before submitting an abbreviated report:
      2.31.1.1. HQ AFPC/DPFCS may waive the requirement to submit abbreviated reports, depending
      on the nature of the incident and the number of casualties.
   2.31.2. Multiple Reportable Casualties:
      2.31.2.1. When multiple casualties make it difficult to submit standard reports in a timely manner
      using assigned casualty services personnel or a CAST, use the appropriate abbreviated Casualty
      Report (see Attachment 12 through Attachment 13) to initially report casualties.
      2.31.2.2. When an incident occurs, if possible, the CAR immediately contacts HQ AFPC/DPFCS
      by telephone at DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048 for approval of abbreviated reporting.
          2.31.2.2.1. If telephone contact is impossible, the MPF commander determines if abbreviated
          reporting is necessary.
      2.31.2.3. Immediately submit items A through D (see Attachment 12 and Attachment 13).
          2.31.2.3.1. As soon as additional information becomes available, submit another abbreviated
          Casualty Report for the remaining items (Attachment 12).
      2.31.2.4. Once conditions permit, submit standard initial Death Reports (see Attachment 2) on
      the personnel listed in Table 1.1.
      2.31.2.5. You do not have to submit a standard initial Casualty Report on DUSTWUN, missing,
      or injured persons whom you reported in an abbreviated Casualty Report. You must submit these
      standard reports, however, as applicable:
          2.31.2.5.1. Search Progress Reports (see Attachment 4).
          2.31.2.5.2. Returned to Military Control Reports (see Attachment 5).
          2.31.2.5.3. VSI, SI, and III Medical Progress Reports (see Attachment 11). NOTE: You may
          use the abbreviated Medical Progress Report (see Attachment 14) until such time as you can
          submit standard reports.
      2.31.2.6. Complete all applicable items on abbreviated Casualty Reports (see Attachment 12 and
      13) and abbreviated Medical Progress Reports (see Attachment 14).
      2.31.2.7. Report first those casualties requiring personal notification to the NOK.
54                                                      AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


            2.31.2.7.1. Give reports on deceased and missing persons priority.
            2.31.2.7.2. Do not delay reporting while obtaining information on less serious casualties.
        2.31.2.8. Report information on injured personnel in a subsequent abbreviated Casualty Report.
        2.31.2.9. HQ AFPC/DPFCS will provide prioritizing guidance during the initial telephone call
        from the reporting unit.

   3.9.2. If the NOK live on or near the member’s home installation, the member’s wing, group, squad-
   ron commander, or other officer, as determined by the installation commander, effects personal noti-
   fication to the NOK, provides circumstances surrounding the incident and expresses condolences.
   3.9.3. If the NOK or any persons to be notified do not reside on or in the vicinity of the member’s
   home installation:
       3.9.3.1. The reporting CAR contacts HQ AFPC/DPFCS by telephone at DSN 665-3505 or

   cumstances of the casualty dictate.
       3.9.4.1. Whenever someone other than the member’s commander or designated representative

       phone as soon as possible. EXCEPTION: When telephone contact can not be made to the NOK,
       the commander communicates through the most expedient means available.

        ment) with the exception of the medical technician who can wear the uniform of the day (he/she
        remains in the vehicle).

3.10. ANG Casualties.
     3.10.1. HQ AFPC/DPFCS contacts the member’s unit and informs ANG/DPFOC at DSN 327-0901
     before beginning the notification process:
        3.10.1.1. Offers the unit the opportunity to notify the NOK.
        3.10.1.2. Provides appropriate notification guidance and information.
     3.10.2. If HQ AFPC/DPFCS is unable to contact the unit or otherwise ensure prompt notification,
     they will assign notification responsibilities to the installation or GSU closest to the NOK.

3.11. Notification Team Composition.

     notification duty.
        3.11.1.1. Medical personnel capable of rendering medical assistance to the NOK if needed and an
        Air Force chaplain, if available, accompany the notification officer to attend to any reaction of the
        NOK.
            3.11.1.1.1. Whenever possible, without causing delay, the chaplain should be of the same
            faith as the family.
            3.11.1.1.2. Notification should not be delayed due to the inability to obtain a medical officer
            or chaplain.
            3.11.1.1.3. The commander or notification officer may invite another person to accompany
            the notification team such as a friend, co-worker or clergy/leader from the member’s faith
            community, known by the member’s family whose presence may be comforting to the family,
            if it does not delay the notification process.
     3.11.2. Public affairs (PA) officers should be requested to accompany the team when there are indica-
     tions there is a high level of media interest and the presence of media is likely.
        3.11.2.1. When possible, the PA officer should travel with the notification team, but should wait
        with the vehicle until notification is made to the family and the notification officer requests PA
        assistance.
            3.11.2.1.1. After the notification is completed, the notification officer will provide the family
            a copy of the PA Information Fact Sheet and provide the family with PA contact information.
            PA officers will assist families in how to deal with the civilian media, and offer assistance with
            any public statements and family’s desires on how and when to answer media questions.
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                   75


      3.11.2.2. When media is already at the family residence prior to or during the notification, the PA
      officer should act as the liaison between the media and the family, in keeping with the family’s
      desires.
      3.11.2.3. Casualty notification officers in remote areas who have no local PA officer will provide
      families the name and contact information for AFPC/PA.
   3.11.3. On active duty installations, notification team members should assemble in the CAR’s office
   within 30-45 minutes after receiving the telephone call from the CAR.

3.12. Arranging Transportation for the Notification Officer or Team.
   3.12.1. The CAR, with help from the vehicle dispatcher, provides a military vehicle, sedan, mini-van,
   or other appropriate vehicle for the notification officer.
      3.12.1.1. GSU commanders should establish arrangements for use of a government vehicle if
      available.
   3.12.2. AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, provides for use of base vehicles for official government
   use.
   3.12.3. Notification officers must use military vehicles when available; otherwise, use of a POV is
   authorized.
      3.12.3.1. When travel must be performed using a POV, the notification officer submits Standard
      Form (SF) 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business, to their ser-
      vicing Financial Services Office (FSO) for reimbursement of expenses.
      3.12.3.2. Reimbursement of expenses is chargeable to unit operation and maintenance (O&M)
      funds.

3.13. Communication Support for Notification Officer and Team.
   3.13.1. The MPF or GSU commander, with the help of support agencies, provides portable commu-
   nication equipment (i.e., cellular telephone or two-way radio) for use by the notification officer or
   team.
   3.13.2. The immediate availability of means to communicate for notification officers and teams with
   their installation casualty office and HQ AFPC/DPFCS is valuable should the notification officer or
   team encounter obstacles which prevent effecting and confirming notifications in a timely manner.

3.14. Location of the NOK.
   3.14.1. If the reporting installation is not making notification to the NOK, the CAR assigned notifica-
   tion responsibility, or HQ AFPC/DPFCS, will provide the notification officer the NOK’s last known
   address:
      3.14.1.1. Encourage the notification officer to contact local law enforcement officials if assis-
      tance is necessary to protect the notification team in a dangerous area, when weather conditions
      may endanger the lives of the team, or to help the officer locate NOK with rural route or post
      office box addresses.

3.15. Inability to Locate the NOK.
     3.15.1. If it appears the NOK is not at home, the notification officer should contact neighbors, law
     enforcement agencies, or the local postmaster (not a postal clerk) for information regarding the
     NOK’s whereabouts.
     3.15.2. If the notification officer or team cannot locate the NOK, or the NOK has moved from the
     area, the notification officer should immediately telephone HQ AFPC/DPFCS at their toll-free num-
     ber (1-800-433-0048) for further guidance and provide the information concerning attempts to contact
     the NOK.

3.16. Preparing the Notification Letter.
     3.16.1. When the member’s commander or designated representative personally notifies the NOK, a
     notification letter is not required.
     3.16.2. When HQ AFPC/DPFCS directs an installation or officer at a GSU to make a casualty notifi-
     cation, HQ AFPC/DPFCS completes the appropriate notification letter and faxes or e-mails to the
     installation CAR or officer at the GSU. (See Attachment 19 and Attachment 20)
     3.16.3. The installation CAR or officer at the GSU signs the notification letter and faxes it to HQ
     AFPC/DPFCS.
     3.16.4. When circumstances prevent HQ AFPC/DPFCS from providing the letter, the notification
     officer or CAR completes the letter using these instructions:
        3.16.4.1. Type on plain bond paper—no letterhead.
        3.16.4.2. Use Times New Roman, 12-point font.

   graphs 3.17.2. and 3.17.3.
   3.17.2. The Air Force honors the NOK's wishes to notify other family members (e.g., if the spouse
   wishes to notify adult children or the parents). EXCEPTION: Whenever a casualty occurs as the
   result of either hostile action or terrorist activity, initial notification(s) shall also be made in person to
   parents who are secondary NOK, unless unusual circumstances exist.
   3.17.3. If NOK call the Air Force to ask about a member's status before they receive official notifica-
   tion, HQ AFPC/DPFCS, the member's commander or designated representative, or the CAR tells the
   caller the member's status during the call:
       3.17.3.1. Be as compassionate as possible.
       3.17.3.2. Advise the caller of the Air Force's progress in notifying other family members (e.g., tell
       them if a notification team is on the road).
       3.17.3.3. Such telephone notification does not preclude the requirement for a circumstance or
       condolence letter, as appropriate.
   3.17.4. The notification officer must be alert to the needs of the NOK and represent the Air Force in
   a professional manner.
       3.17.4.1. Being prepared, sincere, and alert to the needs of the NOK at time of notification will
       reduce some of the shock that is normal under these circumstances.
   3.17.5. Stereotyped procedures are not appropriate.
   3.17.6. As a minimum, the notification officer should:
       3.17.6.1. Identify himself or herself and any other members of the team to the NOK.
       3.17.6.2. After identifying him or herself, he/she should make sure he/she is speaking to the cor-

           that they have an important message to deliver and ask permission to enter the residence.

            sonnel.

            3.17.6.3.5. Inform the NOK, if stated in the notification letter, that the deceased member’s

       3.19.1.1. Confirm the NOK’s address is correct and obtain their telephone number for future con-
       tact.
       3.19.1.2. Advise the NOK that should they be unable to personally notify other family members,
       the Air Force will assist them in either locating the members of the family, or making personal
       notification. Example statement to NOK. “I/we assume you’ll want to notify Sergeant Jones’ par-
       ents yourself. If you have any difficulty in locating them, we’ll help find them. If you don’t feel
       comfortable notifying them, the Air Force will send out another notification team to their home.”
       EXCEPTION: Whenever a casualty occurs as the result of either hostile action or terrorist activ-
       ity, initial notification(s) shall also be made in person to parents who are secondary NOK, unless
       unusual circumstances exist.

Section 4A—General Information for Active Air Force Members, ANG and USAFR Members in a
Duty Status, and Retiree Deaths Within 120 Days After Retirement

4.1. Overview.
     4.1.1. The Air Force provides casualty assistance to the family members and other designated benefi-
     ciaries of deceased and missing members (see Table 1.1.).
     4.1.2. Casualty assistance includes:
        4.1.2.1. Counseling regarding rights, benefits and entitlements.
        4.1.2.2. Filling out claim applications for monetary benefits and privileges.
        4.1.2.3. Resolving issues, problems or concerns the NOK may have.

4.2. Responsibilities.
     4.2.1. The MPF commander assigns a CAR to provide casualty assistance to the NOK of military
     members and retirees.
     4.2.2. The CPF provides casualty assistance to the NOK of DoD and DAF civilian employees (see
     AFI 36-809).
     4.2.3. HQ AFPC/DPFCS assigns casualty assistance responsibility based on where the NOK resides.
        4.2.3.1. If the NOK live on or in the vicinity of the base reporting the casualty, that base assumes
        casualty assistance responsibility.
        4.2.3.2. When there is more than one NOK (e.g., a single member with divorced parents) HQ
        AFPC/DPFCS will assign casualty assistance responsibility based on which NOK receives the
        majority of the benefits.
        4.2.3.3. If the NOK does not live on or in the vicinity of the reporting base, HQ AFPC/DPFCS
        will match the NOK's ZIP Code to the list on the HQ AFPC/DPFCS web site to determine which
        casualty assistance office will provide assistance.
        4.2.3.4. The HQ AFPC/DPFCS web site provides a listing of casualty assistance areas of respon-
        sibility by ZIP Code that are compared with the NOK’s address to determine which base has casu-
        alty assistance.
            4.2.3.4.1. HQ AFPC/DPFCS accepts informal agreements between bases, on a case-by-case
            basis, to transfer casualty assistance for the sake of convenience to the NOK.
            4.2.3.4.2. To formalize such arrangements, the affected MPF commanders must submit a
            coordinated memorandum to permanently reassign specific ZIP Codes within their area of
            responsibility through their respective MAJCOM to HQ AFPC/DPFCS for approval.
     4.2.4. HQ AFPC/DPFCS determines and notifies those bases assisting other family members or per-
     sons designated as beneficiaries. Close coordination must be maintained between all assistance bases
     to ensure all benefits are applied for and received.

      4.2.4.1. There may be instances when it’s in the best interest of the family for only one primary
      CAR to provide assistance. These cases must be approved by DPFCS.

      4.2.5.1. If the servicing ANG MPF does not have casualty assistance capability, HQ AFPC/
      DPFCS assigns casualty assistance responsibility to an Air Force installation using the HQ AFPC/
      DPFCS web site.

        be present at the first visit with the NOK, the CAR must:
            4.5.4.4.1. Complete the appropriate claim applications, unless the NOK prefers to visit the
            VA office to have them complete the applications. It is the CAR’s responsibility to ensure all
            VA claim forms are completed in a timely manner.
            4.5.4.4.2. Mail the claim applications, with supporting documentation to the appropriate
            agency, as listed in Table 4.2. or Table 4.3..

Section 4B—Benefit Information and Casualty Assistance Procedures for Active Air Force Members,
and ANG and USAFR Members in a Duty Status

4.8. General Procedures.
   4.8.1. Explain to the NOK all benefits listed on the AF IMT 58, and in AFPAM 36-3027.
   4.8.2. Give the NOK a copy of AFPAM 36-3027.
   4.8.3. Use the AF IMT 58 as a checklist and guide during the counseling session.
   4.8.4. Explain to the NOK that the AF IMT 58 is used to track and document benefits and entitle-
   ments applied for and received.
   4.8.5. Complete the necessary claim applications for applicable benefits (see Table 4.2.).
   4.8.6. Complete all items on the AF IMT 58 using the instructions in Attachment 21. Briefly summa-
   rize relevant information discussed with the NOK in item 11, and any problems in item 12, “Addi-
   tional Comments.”
   4.8.7. Keep a copy of all claim applications, forms, and supporting documentation in the case file.

4.9. Death Gratuity. A lump sum gratuitous payment made by the Air Force to eligible beneficiaries of
a member who dies on AD, ADT, or IDT, or full-time National Guard duty. Its purpose is to help the sur-
vivors in their readjustment and to aid them in meeting immediate expenses incurred. The claim form
required to apply for this benefit is DD Form 397, Claim Certification and Voucher for Death Gratu-
ity Payment. The CAR must provide the base FSO a copy of the member’s vRED or DD Form 93 and the
initial Death Report. The FSO should complete the DD Form 397 and issue the check to the CAR for
delivery to the NOK.
   4.9.1. The death gratuity payment is made to survivors of the deceased in this order:
       4.9.1.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse. The payment is delivered by the CAR assigned to
       the reporting or assistance base within 24 hours of the member’s death, unless the surviving
       spouse desires other arrangements.
       4.9.1.2. When there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member, regardless of age or mar-
       ital status, in equal shares (state laws guide payment to minor children). NOTE: DFAS-DE/PMJ
       (Special Accounts Branch) makes payment to minor children within 30 days after receipt of DD
       Form 397 and supporting documentation.
       4.9.1.3. If none of the above, to the parents, siblings, or any combination as designated by the
       deceased member. The CAR delivers the payment within 24 hours of the member’s death, unless
       the NOK desires other arrangements.
       4.9.1.4. The death gratuity is not paid to any other person when there are no survivors as listed
       above. A will is not a legal designation for death gratuity since such payment is not an allowance
       or a debt due the member and cannot be part of the member’s estate.
88                                                       AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


     4.9.2. Refer to DODR 7000.14-R, DoD Financial Management Regulation, Volume 7A, Military Pay
     Policy and Procedures Active Duty and Reserve Pay, chapter 36, Payment on Behalf of Deceased
     Members, and table 36-4, Responsibility for Payment of Death Gratuity—Air Force.

4.10. Financial Assistance.
     4.10.1. The CAR should ask the NOK about their immediate financial needs.
     4.10.2. If the NOK is not eligible for the death gratuity, or if immediate payment is not possible, con-
     tact the nearest American Red Cross (ARC) or Air Force Aid Society (AFAS) representative, with the
     family’s permission, located in the Family Support Center (FSC), for possible assistance.

4.11. Unpaid Pay and Allowances. Upon death of an active duty member, any pay and allowances due
but not paid to the member, are paid to the designated beneficiary named on the member’s vRED or DD
Form 93. Unpaid pay and allowances may include unpaid basic pay, payment for up to 60 days of accrued
leave, basic allowance for housing for up to 180 days, amounts due for travel, per diem expenses, trans-
portation of eligible family members, shipment of household goods, and unpaid installments of a variable
reenlistment bonus. DFAS-DE Center will audit the decedent’s pay records and issue a check for any
amount due to the designated beneficiary.
     4.11.1. When there is no written designation by the member, any money due is paid to the first eligi-
     ble recipient in the following order:
        4.11.1.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
        4.11.1.2. If there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares, with the
        share of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child.
        4.11.1.3. If none of the above, to the parents of the member in equal shares or to the surviving par-
        ent.
        4.11.1.4. If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s estate.
        4.11.1.5. If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws of the
        state in which the member was domiciled.
     4.11.2. To apply for the unpaid pay and allowances, the CAR should complete the required claim
     form listed in Table 4.2.
     4.11.3. Mail the original claim form and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table
     4.2., to DFAS-DE/PMJ (Special Accounts Branch), 6760 East Irvington Place, Denver, CO
     80279-3000.
     4.11.4. When the unpaid pay and allowances are divided, the base with primary assistance responsi-
     bility submits all claim forms in one package.

4.12. Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). Eligible family members of deceased active duty members
are entitled to 180 days of housing allowance or to remain in government quarters up to 180 days at no
charge. DFAS-DE/PMJ is required by Title 37, U.S.C., Section 403, to make this payment to eligible ben-
eficiaries. Eligible family members occupying government housing on the date the member dies may con-
tinue to occupy such housing without charge for a period of 180 days. If the family members vacate the
government housing before the 180 days are up, the BAH is paid for the remaining unused days. NOTE:
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                    89


When unpaid pay and allowances are paid to a person other than the member’s spouse, the CAR should
apply for the BAH on behalf of the spouse.

4.13. Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). SBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force to the surviving
spouse or, in some cases, eligible children of a member who dies on active duty in the line of duty (LOD).
The annuity is equal to 55 percent of the retired pay to which the member would have been entitled as if
retired for total disability on the date of death. The spouse’s annuity is reduced by the amount of the
monthly Dependency and Indemnity Compensation payment awarded and paid to the surviving spouse by
the VA. Originally, the SBP annuity was reduced when the surviving spouse reaches age 62, but begin-
ning April 2008, there will no longer be a reduction (see note below). The annuity is paid until the spouse
dies, but is suspended upon remarriage before age 55. The annuity to a surviving spouse may be reinstated
if the subsequent marriage ends in death or divorce. The annuitant must send a certified copy of the
divorce decree or death certificate to DFAS-CL (Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military
Annuitant Pay, P.O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131) to reinstate the annuity. If a second SBP benefit
resulted from the remarriage, the surviving spouse must elect which of the two SBP benefits to receive.
Should the surviving spouse remarry at age 55 or older, the annuitant will continue to receive the monthly
annuity. The surviving spouse must notify DFAS of any changes in marital status. See AFI 36-3006, Sur-
vivor Benefit Plan (SBP) and Supplemental Survivor Benefit Plan (SSBP) (Active, Guard, Reserve, and
Retired), for additional information.
NOTE: The National Defense Authorization Act 2005 established an incremental phase-out of the age
62 reduction: After September 2005 and before April 2006 the annuity reduces to 40%; After March 2006
and before April 2007 the annuity reduces to 45%; After March 2007 and before April 2008 the annuity
reduces to 50%; after March 2008 the annuity remains at 55%..
   4.13.1. The CAR will fax the claim forms and any supporting documentation, as listed in Table 4.2.,
   to HQ AFPC/DPFCS at DSN 665-2348, and DFAS-CL at DSN 580-6321.
   4.13.2. For active duty deaths when the member is survived by both a spouse and child(ren) contact
   HQ AFPC/DPPRT (SBP Branch) at DSN 665-2274 for guidance in processing steps to establish
   appropriate annuity.
       4.13.2.1. HQ AFPC/DPPRT will process the active duty claim when the surviving spouse waives
       SBP in favor of the member’s children. Documentation required to be forwarded to HQ AFPC/
       DPPRT is described on the SBP web site.
   4.13.3. Surviving spouse must elect either spouse or child(ren) only coverage on election memoran-
   dum. HQ AFPC/DPPRT requires only the spouse’s statement if the SBP is retained for the surviving
   spouse.
       4.13.3.1. CAR must ensure surviving spouse is properly counseled on his or her options regarding
       the receipt of SBP annuity for both spouse and child only coverage .
   4.13.4. The CAR must ensure the claim is processed and the annuity established prior to closing out
   the case. In some cases, the VA DIC entitlement will totally offset the SBP annuity. However, an
   annuity must be established regardless of the amount. There is a 6-year statute of limitations on filing
   an SBP claim. If a claim is not established within 6 years, there is no legal basis on establishing the
   claim. This is particularly important in cases when the VA DIC completely offsets the SBP annuity
   and the surviving spouse remarries before age 57 when he or she loses DIC entitlement, but the SBP
   annuity can be reinstated.

4.14. Reserve Component Survivor Benefit Plan (RCSBP). RCSBP is a monthly annuity paid by the
Air Force to the surviving spouse or, in some cases, eligible children of an Air Reserve Component mem-
ber who dies and has completed the satisfactory years of service to qualify the member for retired pay at
age 60. The member must have made an election within 90 days of notification of eligibility to participate
in the program. Members on an active Guard/Reserve 10211 (officer) or 12310 (enlisted) tour, are eligible
to participate in the plan. Coverage is not automatic unless the member dies before the 90-day period
established by law. The initial annuity paid to a surviving spouse is equal to 55 percent of the retired pay
to which the member would have been entitled at age 60, reduced by the Reserve Portion Cost. See AFI
36-3006 for additional information.
     4.14.1. If the member meets the eligibility requirements, fax the claim forms and supporting docu-
     mentation, as listed in Table 4.2., to HQ AFPC/DPFCS at DSN 665-2348 and DFAS-CL at
     1-800-982-8459.
     4.14.2. Mail the original claim forms and copies of any supporting documentation to Defense Finance
     and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131.
     4.14.3. Contact the base FSO to check on the payment status of the RCSBP annuity prior to checking
     with DFAS.

4.15. Montgomery GI Bill Death Benefit. The VA will pay a special Montgomery GI Bill death benefit
to a designated survivor in the event of the service-connected death of an individual while on active duty.
Service connection is determined by the VA using an AF IMT 348, Line of Duty Determination. The
deceased must either have been entitled to educational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill program
or a participant in the program who would have been so entitled but for the high school diploma or
length-of-service requirement. The amount paid will be equal to the participant’s actual military pay
reduction less any education benefits paid. If the member contributed to this program, the designated
SGLI beneficiary may be entitled to the death benefit. The death benefit is paid to whoever is designated
to receive the member’s SGLI. To apply for the death benefit, the CAR should submit a letter, along with
the member’s SGLI certificate (SGLV 8286), and a copy of the DD Form 1300 and AF IMT 348, as listed
in Table 4.2. to the VARO, St. Louis Regional Processing Officer, ATTN: Chapter 30, Montgomery GI
Bill, PO Box 66830, 331/225, St. Louis MO 63103-6830. See VAP 80-XX-1 for additional benefit infor-
mation. *NOTE: The second two digits represent the year of publication.

4.16. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC). DIC is payable by the VA to surviving
spouses, unmarried children under age 18, disabled children, children between the ages of 18 and 23 if
attending a VA-approved school, and low-income parents of members who die from a disease or injury
incurred or aggravated while on active duty or active duty for training, an injury incurred or aggravated in
the line of duty while on inactive duty for training, or a disability otherwise compensable under laws
administered by the VA. DIC is not paid if the VA determines that the member’s own misconduct contrib-
uted to the death. DIC paid to a surviving spouse is not based on the member’s military pay grade. The
amount paid for a spouse with one or more children of the deceased is increased for each child. The
amount of the DIC payment for parents varies according to the number of parents, the amount of their
individual or combined total annual income, and whether they live together or, if remarried, live with a
spouse. DIC payments to a surviving spouse are payable for life, as long as the spouse does not remarry.
Should the surviving spouse remarry, payments are terminated, but may be restored if the subsequent
marriage ends in death, divorce or annulment. See VAP 80-XX-1, for additional information. *NOTE:
The second two digits represent the year of publication.
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                       91


   4.16.1. To apply for DIC, the CAR should complete the appropriate claim application as listed in
   Table 4.2.
   4.16.2. Mail the original claim application and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in
   Table 4.2., to the VA Regional Office, P. O. Box 8079, Philadelphia, PA 19101. DIC claims for retir-
   ees who die within 120 days of retirement are processed through the local VARO servicing the surviv-
   ing family.

4.17. Non-service-Connected Death Pension. If the VARO determines that the NOK is not eligible for
DIC, they may be eligible to apply for a non-service-connected death pension. Surviving spouses of
deceased members with wartime service and unmarried children under age 18, or age 23 if attending a
VA-approved school, may be eligible for this pension if they meet income limitations prescribed by law.
Qualifying children who become incapable of self-support because of a disability before age 18 may be
eligible for a pension as long as the condition exists unless the child marries or the child’s income exceeds
the income limit. The rate of pension depends on the amount of income the surviving spouse or child
receives from other sources. A pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is reason-
able to assume the estate will maintain them financially. The VA will determine their eligibility. See VAP
80-XX-1, for additional information. *NOTE: The second two digits represent the year of publication.
   4.17.1. Eligible survivors should visit their local VA office to complete the appropriate claim appli-
   cation with the supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.2.

4.18. Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI). The SGLI payment is the maximum allowable
by law, unless the member elected a lesser amount or declined coverage in writing. Monthly premium
payments for the level of coverage selected by the member were automatically deducted from the mem-
ber’s pay. The Office of Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (OSGLI) under the jurisdiction of the
Department of VA makes determination and payment of proceeds. The claim form required to apply for
this benefit is VA Form SGLV 8283. Payment of proceeds to a beneficiary is exempt from taxation. The
insured member may have designated as principal or contingent beneficiary any person, firm, corporation
or legal entity, including his/her estate, individually or as a trustee. If the member designated a trust, he/
she indicated the name and date of the trust in the beneficiary block. If the member designated a trust
through a will, he/she annotated “Last Will and Testament” in the beneficiary block. If the member chose
not to designate a specific beneficiary but preferred the proceeds be paid in the order of precedence, the
member selected the “By Law” designation.
   4.18.1. When the “By Law” designation is used, the proceeds are automatically paid in the following
   order of precedence:
       4.18.1.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
       4.18.1.2. If there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares, with the
       shares of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child.
       4.18.1.3. If none of the above, to the parents of the member in equal shares or to the surviving par-
       ent.
       4.18.1.4. If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s estate.
       4.18.1.5. If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws of the
       state in which the member was domiciled.

4.19. Social Security Payments. Social Security monthly benefits are paid to a spouse or a divorced
spouse, age 60 or over; a spouse or divorced spouse regardless of age with children of the decedent under
age 16 or disabled in their care and meeting Social Security requirements. A divorced spouse must have
been married to the servicemember at least 10 years. Monthly payments are also paid to children until age
18, 19 if a full-time student at a primary or secondary school, or age 18 or older if disabled before age 18.
Spouses who wait until age 65 to apply for Social Security receive maximum benefits. However, they can
receive reduced Social Security payments between ages 60 and 65. Dependent parents are eligible for
benefits at age 62 if they were more than 50 percent dependent on the deceased servicemember for their
support. The amount paid can only be determined by the Social Security Administration, which has a
record of the wages earned by the member during the period of both military and civilian employment
under the Social Security Program. To apply for this benefit, the CAR should contact the “Expedited
Claims Processing Center” in Philadelphia, PA at 1-866-777-7887, as soon as they obtain sufficient fam-
ily information to establish the claim. This office will explain the benefit, determine their eligibility, the
amount to be paid, and contact the family directly is additional documentation is required. The “Expedited
Claims Processing Center” will establish the claim immediately based on the information provided by the
CAR.

4.20. Social Security Lump Sum Death Payment. The Social Security Administration pays a lump
sum death payment, up to $255, to the surviving spouse living with the member at the time of death. Sep-
aration because of military service, is considered living together. If there is no surviving spouse, it is paid
to the oldest child who was eligible for or entitled to Social Security benefits during the month of the
member’s death. No other survivors are entitled to this benefit. This benefit is paid even if burial, funeral,
or memorial benefits were paid by the Air Force. To apply for this benefit, the CAR should contact the
“Expedited Claims Processing Center” in Philadelphia, PA at 1-866-777-7887, as soon as they obtain suf-
ficient family information to establish the claim. This office will explain the benefit, determine their eligi-
bility, the amount to be paid, and contact the family directly is additional documentation is required. The
“Expedited Claims Processing Center” will establish the claim immediately based on the information pro-
vided by the CAR.

4.21. Other Assistance. The CAR should address these matters:

     4.28.2. Give the NOK a copy of AFPAM 36-3028.
     4.28.3. Use the AF IMT 58 as a checklist and guide during the counseling session.
     4.28.4. Explain to the NOK that the AF IMT 58 is used to track and document benefits and entitle-
     ments applied for and received.
     4.28.5. Complete the necessary claim applications for applicable benefits (see Table 4.3.).
     4.28.6. Complete all items on the AF IMT 58 using the instructions in Attachment 21 and briefly

     “Additional Comments.”
     4.28.7. Keep a copy of all claim applications, forms, and supporting documentation in the case file.

4.29. Death Gratuity. A lump sum gratuitous payment made by DFAS-CL Center to eligible beneficia-
ries of a retiree who dies within 120 days following placement on the permanent or temporary disability
retired list (PDRL/TDRL), or who is retired for years of service. Payments can be made only after the VA
determines death was caused by an illness or injury incurred while the retiree was on active duty, ADT, or
IDT. Under no circumstances will the local FSO make payments in these cases. The claim forms required
to apply for this benefit are DD Form 397, Claim Certificate and Voucher for Death Gratuity Pay-
ment, VA DIC Worksheet, VA Form 21-534, Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensa-
tion, or Death Pension Accrued Benefits by Surviving Spouse or Child, or VA Form 21-535,
Application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation by Parent(s).
     4.29.1. The death gratuity payment is made to survivors of the deceased in this order:
        4.29.1.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
        4.29.1.2. When there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member, regardless of age or
        marital status, in equal shares (state laws guide payment to minor children).
        4.29.1.3. If none of the above, to the parents, siblings, or any combination as designated by the
        deceased member.
        4.29.1.4. The death gratuity is not paid to any other person when there are no survivors as listed
        above. A will is not a legal designation for death gratuity since such payment is not an allowance
        or a debt due the member and cannot be part of the estate.
     4.29.2. To apply for the death gratuity, the CAR should obtain a copy of DD Form 397 from the base
     FSO.
        4.29.2.1. Complete all items on the form except items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 18, which are left blank.

        mentation as listed in Table 4.3.
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                       99


       4.29.2.4. Mail the original form and copies of any supporting documentation to DFAS-CL/
       FRCAE, P.O. Box 99191, Cleveland OH 44199-1126 or FAX to DSN: 580-6321 (see Table 4.3.).
   4.29.3. The CAR should complete either a VA Form 21-534a (DIC Worksheet), VA Form 21-534 or
   VA Form 21-535, as applicable, and follow the procedures in paragraph 4.34.

4.30. Financial Assistance.
   4.30.1. The CAR should ask the NOK about their immediate financial needs.
   4.30.2. If the NOK is not eligible for the death gratuity payment, or if immediate payment is not pos-
   sible, with the NOK’s permission, contact the nearest ARC or AFAS representative located in the
   FSC, for possible assistance.

4.31. Unpaid Pay and Allowances. The retirement pay of an Air Force retired member stops on the first
day of the month in which the retiree died. Upon death of a retired member, any pay and allowances due
but not paid to the member are paid to the designated beneficiary named by the member prior to retire-
ment. Normally, this amounts to the retirement pay from the first day of the month of death through the
date of death. Retirement pay electronically deposited into an account held by a retiree will automatically
be recouped by DFAS-CL and reissued to the beneficiary for the correct amount.
   4.31.1. When the designated beneficiary is deceased, or if the member elected “order of precedence,”
   any money due is paid to the first eligible recipient in the following order:
       4.31.1.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
       4.31.1.2. When there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares, with the
       share of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child.
       4.31.1.3. If none of the above, to the parents of the member in equal shares or to the surviving par-
       ent.

4.32. SBP. SBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force. This program allows personnel who retired
on or after 21 September 1972, to receive reduced retired pay in order to provide a monthly annuity to
their beneficiaries after the death of the retiree. The retiree designates the beneficiaries. Participation in
100                                                     AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


this program is voluntary. SBP provides an eligible surviving spouse or former spouse or, in some cases,
eligible children financial security similar to the financial security a retiree had in retired pay—a
cost-of-living-adjusted monthly income for life. See AFI 36-3006, for additional benefit information.
      4.32.1. If the retiree participated in SBP, fax the required claim forms and copies of any supporting
      documentation as listed in Table 4.3. to HQ AFPC/DPFCS at DSN 665-2348, and DFAS at
      1-800-982-8459.
      4.32.2. Mail the original claim forms and copies of any supporting documentation to Defense Finance

4.33. RCSBP. RCSBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force to the surviving spouse or, in some
cases, eligible children, of an Air Reserve Component member who dies and has completed the satisfac-
tory years of service to qualify the member for retired pay at age 60. The retiree designates the beneficia-
ries. The beneficiary choices are the same as for SBP. Participation in the program is voluntary. See AFI
36-3006 for additional benefit information:
      4.33.1. If the retiree participated in RCSBP, fax the claim forms and supporting documentation as
      listed in Table 4.3. to HQ AFPC/DPFCS at DSN 665-2348, and DFAS at 1-800-982-8459.

4.34. DIC. DIC is payable by the VA to surviving spouses, unmarried children under age 18, disabled
children, children between the ages of 18 and 23 if attending a VA-approved school, and low-income par-
ents of retirees who die from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated while on active duty or active duty
for training, an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while on inactive duty for training, or a
disability otherwise compensable under laws administered by the VA. DIC is not paid if the VA deter-
mines that the retiree’s own misconduct contributed to the death. The monthly DIC rate paid to a surviv-
ing spouse of a retiree for deaths occurring after 1 January 1993 is the same for all pay grades. The DIC
amount paid for a spouse with one or more children of the deceased retiree is increased for each child. The
amount of the DIC payment for parents varies according to the number of parents, the amount of their
individual or combined total annual income, and whether they live together or, if remarried, live with a
spouse. DIC payments to a surviving spouse are payable for life, as long as the spouse does not remarry.
Should the surviving spouse remarry, payments are terminated, but may be restored if the subsequent
marriage ends in death, divorce or annulment. See VAP 80-XX-1 for additional information. *NOTE:
The second two digits represent the year of publication.
      4.34.1. When assisting the survivor of a member who dies within 120 days following placement on
      the PDRL or TDRL:
         4.34.1.1. Follow the procedures for death gratuity in paragraph 4.29.
         4.34.1.2. Complete the appropriate DIC claim application as listed in Table 4.3.
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                    101


       4.34.1.3. Fax the claim application and copies of required documents and any supporting docu-
       mentation as listed in Table 4.3. to HQ AFPC/DPFCS at DSN 665-2348.
       4.34.1.4. Mail the original claim application along with copies of required documents and any
       supporting documentation, as listed in Table 4.3., to VARO-CL, ATTN: Adjudication Officer 21,
       1240 East Ninth Street, Cleveland OH 44199.
   4.34.2. When assisting the survivor of an Air Force member retired for years of service who dies
   within 120 days following retirement:
       4.34.2.1. Follow the procedures for death gratuity in paragraph 4.29.
       4.34.2.2. Complete the appropriate DIC claim application as listed in Table 4.3.
       4.34.2.3. Mail the original claim application and copies of required documents and any support-
       ing documentation, as listed in Table 4.3., to the VARO to process the claim.
   4.34.3. Remember, even if no one is eligible for DIC you should submit the appropriate claim appli-
   cation so the VA can determine if the death is service connected before DFAS-CL will pay the death
   gratuity.
   4.34.4. When the VARO makes a determination of service connection, fax the signed VA Rating
   Decision to HQ AFPC/DPFCS at DSN 665-2348.
       4.34.4.1. The rating should contain the signature of the VA rating specialist, and the statement
       that basic eligibility for death gratuity, under Title 38, U.S.C., Chapter 35, is established.
   4.34.5. HQ AFPC/DPFCS will advise DFAS-CL that payment of the death gratuity is or is not autho-
   rized, and DFAS-CL will annotate their case file accordingly and make payment if authorized.
       4.34.5.1. When assisting the spouse of a retiree who is in receipt of VA disability compensation,
       the spouse can receive the member’s final month’s VA disability compensation through the DIC
       application only.

4.35. Non-Service-Connected Death Pension. If the VARO determines that the NOK is not eligible for
DIC, they may be eligible to apply for a non-service-connected death pension. Surviving spouses of
deceased members with wartime service and unmarried children under age 18, age 23 if attending a
VA-approved school, may be eligible for this pension if they meet income limitations prescribed by law.
Qualifying children who become incapable of self-support because of a disability before age 18 may be
eligible for a pension as long as the condition exists, unless the child marries or the child’s income
exceeds the income limit. The rate of pension depends on the amount of income the surviving spouse or
child receives from other sources. A pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is
reasonable to assume the estate will maintain them financially. The VA will determine their eligibility.
See VAP 80-XX-1 for additional information. *NOTE: The second two digits represent the year of pub-
lication.
   4.35.1. To apply for a non-service-connected death pension, eligible survivors should visit their local
   VA office to complete the appropriate claim application and provide supporting documentation as
   listed in Table 4.3.

4.36. SGLI. Retirees are covered for 120 days following retirement with no additional premium during
the 120-day period. Retirees rated totally disabled on the date of retirement retain SGLI coverage until the
102                                                      AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


disability ceases to be total in degree, but not for more than 1 year. Determination and payment of pro-
ceeds are made by the OSGLI under the jurisdiction of the VA. Payment of proceeds to a beneficiary is
exempt from taxation. The insured member may have designated as principal or contingent beneficiary
any person, firm, corporation or legal entity, including his/her estate, individually or as a trustee. If the
member designated a trust, he/she indicated the name and date of the trust in the beneficiary block. If the
member designated a trust through a will, he/she annotated “Last Will and Testament” in the beneficiary
block. If the member chose not to designate a specific beneficiary but preferred the proceeds be paid in the
order of precedence, the member selected the “By Law” designation.
      4.36.1. When the “By Law” designation is used, the proceeds are automatically paid in the following
      order of precedence:
         4.36.1.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
         4.36.1.2. If there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares, with the
         shares of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child.
         4.36.1.3. If none of the above, to the parents of the member in equal shares or to the surviving par-
         ent.
         4.36.1.4. If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s estate.
         4.36.1.5. If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws of the
         state in which the member was domiciled.
      4.36.2. See paragraph 8.8. and VA Handbook, Servicemembers’ and Veterans’ Group Life Insurance
      Handbook, for additional information.
      4.36.3. To apply for SGLI, the CAR should complete the claim form as listed in Table 4.3.
      4.36.4. Fax the form to HQ AFPC/DPFCS at DSN 665-2348.
      4.36.5. Fax the form and a copy of the Initial Death Report to OSGLI at 1-877-832-4943.
      4.36.6. Mail the original form and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table 4.3., to
      HQ AFPC/DPFCS, 550 C Street West, Suite 14, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4716.
      4.36.7. Contact OSGLI to check on the payment status of the SGLI.

4.37. Service Disabled Veterans Insurance (SDVI) or National Service Life Insurance RH
(NSLI-RH). SDVI is life insurance limited to veterans who left the Service after 24 April 1951. A mem-
ber who had a service-connected disability but was otherwise in good health could apply to the VA for up
to $10,000 in SDVI life insurance coverage at standard rates. Members rated totally disabled by the VA
could apply for a waiver of premiums. For those members eligible for this waiver, additional coverage of
up to $20,000 is available, but the premiums cannot be waived. See VAP 80-XX-1, for additional infor-
mation. *NOTE: The second two digits represent the year of publication.
      4.37.1. If the retiree was covered under SDVI, complete the claim form as listed in Table 4.3.
      4.37.2. Mail the original claim form and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table
      4.3., to the VARO and Insurance Center, Box 8079, Philadelphia PA 19101.

4.38. Montgomery GI Bill Death Benefit. The VA will pay a special Montgomery GI Bill death benefit
to a designated survivor if the death is determined to be in the LOD or within 1 year after discharge or
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                       103


release. The deceased must either have been entitled to educational assistance under the Montgomery GI
Bill program or a participant in the program who would have been so entitled but for the high school
diploma or length-of-service requirement. The amount paid will be equal to the participant’s actual mili-
tary pay reduction less any education benefits paid. The death benefit is paid to the SGLI beneficiary. The
CAR should submit a letter, along with the member’s SGLV 8286 listing the beneficiary, and a copy of
the DD Form 1300 and AF IMT 348, Line of Duty Determination, as listed in Table 4.3. to the VARO,
St. Louis Regional Processing Officer, ATTN: Chapter 30, Montgomery GI Bill, PO Box 66830, 331/225,
St. Louis MO 63103-6830. See VAP 80-XX-1*, for additional benefit information. *NOTE: The second
two digits represent the year of publication.

4.39. Social Security Payments. Social Security monthly benefits are paid to a spouse or a divorced
spouse, age 60 or over; a spouse or divorced spouse regardless of age with children of the decedent under
age 16 or disabled in their care and meeting Social Security requirements. A divorced spouse must have
been married to the servicemember at least 10 years. Monthly payments are also paid to children until age
18, or 19 if a full-time student at a primary or secondary school, or age 18 or older if disabled before age
18. Spouses who wait until age 65 to apply for Social Security receive maximum benefits. However, they
can receive reduced Social Security payments between ages 60 and 65. Dependent parents are eligible for
benefits at age 62 if they were more than 50 percent dependent on the deceased servicemember for their
support. The amount paid can only be determined by the Social Security Administration, which has a
record of the wages earned by the member during the period of both military and civilian employment
under the Social Security Program. To apply for this benefit, the CAR should contact the “Expedited
Claims Processing Center” in Philadelphia, PA at 1-866-777-7887, as soon as they obtain sufficient fam-
ily information to establish the claim. This office will explain the benefit, determine their eligibility, the
amount to be paid, and contact the family directly is additional documentation is required. The “Expedited
Claims Processing Center” will establish the claim immediately based on the information provided by the
CAR.

4.40. Social Security Lump Sum Death Payment. The Social Security Administration pays a lump
sum death payment, up to $255, to the surviving spouse living with the member at the time of death. Sep-
aration because of military service, is considered living together. If there is no surviving spouse, it is paid
to the oldest child who was eligible for or entitled to Social Security benefits during the month of the
member’s death. No other survivors are entitled to this benefit. This benefit is paid even if burial, funeral,
or memorial benefits were paid by the Air Force. To apply for this benefit, the CAR should contact the
“Expedited Claims Processing Center” in Philadelphia, PA at 1-866-777-7887, as soon as they obtain suf-
ficient family information to establish the claim. This office will explain the benefit, determine their eligi-
bility, the amount to be paid, and contact the family directly is additional documentation is required. The
“Expedited Claims Processing Center” will establish the claim immediately based on the information pro-
vided by the CAR.

4.41. Other Assistance. The CAR addresses these other matters:
   4.41.1. Living Outside the CONUS. If the NOK plan to establish residence outside the CONUS, the
   CAR should:
       4.41.1.1. Advise them that military privileges may or may not be available to them.
       4.41.1.2. Advise them that the government will not pay import duties on items such as household
       goods and automobiles.

   and Social Security benefits and how to apply.
   4.50.2. Send a letter (see Attachment 22 and Attachment 23) to the parents no later than 15 days
   after the first contact with the NOK. EXCEPTION: If the parents as NOK are receiving an initial
   casualty assistance visit, advise them in person during the initial visit.

4.51. Unpaid Pay and Allowances. The retirement pay of an Air Force member stops on the day the
retiree dies. Upon the death of a retired member, any pay and allowances due but not paid to the member
are paid to the designated beneficiary named by the member prior to retirement. Normally, this amounts
to the retirement pay from the first day of the month of death through the date of death. Retirement pay
electronically deposited into an account held by a retiree will automatically be recouped by DFAS-CL and
reissued to the beneficiary for the correct amount.
   4.51.1. When the designated beneficiary is deceased, or if the member elected “order of precedence,”
   any money due is paid to the first eligible recipient in the following order:
       4.51.1.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
       4.51.1.2. When there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares, with the
       share of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child.
       4.51.1.3. If none of the above, to the parents of the member in equal shares or to the surviving par-
       ent.
       4.51.1.4. If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s estate.
       4.51.1.5. If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws of the
       state in which the member was domiciled.
   4.51.2. To apply for the unpaid pay and allowances, the CAR should complete the claim form as
   listed in Table 4.3.
       4.51.2.1. Mail the original claim form and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in
       Table 4.3., to Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Retiree Pay, P. O. Box
       7131, London KY 40742-7131
       4.51.2.2. When unpaid pay and allowances are divided, the base with primary assistance respon-
       sibility submits all claim forms in one package.

4.52. Retired Serviceman’s Family Protection Plan (RSFPP). The RSFPP program allowed person-
nel who retired before 21 September 1972 to receive reduced retired pay in order to provide an annuity for
certain beneficiaries after the death of the retiree. Participation in this program was voluntary. See AFI
36-3006, for additional information.
110                                                        AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


      4.52.1. If the retiree elected to participate in RSFPP, follow the applicable instructions listed in para-
      graph 4.55. or 4.56.

4.53. SBP. SBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force. This program allows personnel who retired
on or after 21 September 1972, or before if they enrolled in the program during an open season, to receive
reduced retired pay in order to provide a monthly annuity to their beneficiaries after the death of the
retiree. The retiree designates the beneficiaries. Participation in this program is voluntary. SBP provides
an eligible surviving spouse or former spouse or, in some cases, eligible children, financial security simi-
lar to the financial security a retiree had in retired pay—a cost-of-living-adjusted monthly income for life.
See AFI 36-3006 for additional information.
      4.53.1. If the retiree elected to participate in SBP, follow the applicable instructions listed in para-
      graph 4.55. or 4.56.

4.54. RCSBP. RCSBP is a monthly annuity paid by the Air Force to the surviving spouse or, in some
cases, eligible children, of an Air Reserve Component member who dies and has completed the satisfac-
tory years of service to qualify the member for retired pay at age 60. The retiree designates the beneficia-
ries. The beneficiary choices are the same as for SBP. Participation in the program is voluntary. See AFI
36-3006 for additional benefit information.
      4.54.1. The three options that were available to the member at time of election are:
         4.54.1.1. Option A. Member declines to make an election until age 60. If death occurs prior to age
         60, no annuity is payable.
         4.54.1.2. Option B. Coverage provides for an annuity to begin on the 60th anniversary of mem-
         ber’s birth, if death occurs before age 60, or to begin immediately when death occurs after age 60.
         4.54.1.3. Option C. Coverage provides for an annuity to begin immediately, whether death occurs
         before or after age 60.
      4.54.2. If the retiree participated in RCSBP, follow the applicable instructions listed in paragraph
      4.55. or 4.56.
      4.54.3. Mail the original claim forms and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table
      4.3., to Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, Lon-
      don, KY 40742-7131.
      4.54.4. Contact the base FSO to check on the payment status of the RCSBP annuity prior to checking
      with DFAS.

4.55. Processing RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP Annuities at Installations With Defense Retiree and
Annuitant Pay System (DRAPS) Access.
      4.55.1. Payment should begin within 30 days of the death notification date. The CAR and FSO must
      process the annuity in time to meet this goal.
      4.55.2. If the retiree participated in RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP, the CAR should:
         4.55.2.1. Inform the local FSO of a confirmed death.
         4.55.2.2. Give the FSO the retiree’s name, SSN, date of retirement, grade, and date of death.
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                     111


   4.55.3. The FSO should give the CAR information on the deceased's retired pay and beneficiary.
   4.55.4. Within 10 workdays, the CAR should obtain from the NOK the required claim forms and sup-
   porting documentation as listed in Table 4.3., and provide them to the base FSO for processing:
       4.55.4.1. When RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP is divided between more than one child, and they do not
       reside together, the assisting CARs send all documentation using overnight mail service, to the
       CAR with primary assistance responsibility who will then submit all claim applications in one
       package to the FSO.
       4.55.4.2. Mail all claim forms and supporting documentation directly to Defense Finance and
       Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131.
   4.55.5. The local FSO:
       4.55.5.1. Determines the need for additional documents, depending on data already in DRAPS,
       and advises the CAR accordingly.
       4.55.5.2. Advises the CAR if security restrictions or questionable entitlements prevent DFAS
       from processing the annuity package.

4.56. Processing RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP Annuities at Installations Without DRAPS Access.
   4.56.1. When the casualty assistance base does not have DRAPS access, claim applications for
   RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP, with supporting documentation, should be submitted directly to DFAS for
   processing.
   4.56.2. Payment should begin within 30 days of the death notification date. The CAR and DFAS
   should process the annuity in time to meet this goal.
   4.56.3. The CAR must inform DFAS by telephone at DSN 580-6153 or 1-800-321-1080 of a con-
   firmed death on the same day the CAR is notified.
   4.56.4. When informed of the death, DFAS-CL/FRCAE immediately gives the CAR information rel-
   ative to the retired pay account of the deceased, to include RSFPP or SBP election, allotments, net
   pay, VA and retirement pay, and beneficiary data.
   4.56.5. The CAR contacts the NOK to arrange a personal visit to complete the claim forms and obtain
   the supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3. to establish the account.
       4.56.5.1. The CAR should consider the wishes of the NOK.
   4.56.6. Within 10 workdays of being notified of the death, the CAR mails the claim forms along with
   copies of any supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3., to Defense Finance and Accounting
   Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P.O. Box 7131, London KY 40742-7131.

4.57. DIC. DIC is payable by the VA to surviving spouses, unmarried children under age 18, disabled
children, children between the ages of 18 and 23 if attending a VA-approved school, and low-income par-
ents of retirees who die from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated while on active duty or active duty
for training, an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while on inactive duty for training, or a
disability otherwise compensable under laws administered by the VA. DIC payments may also be autho-
rized for the survivor of a retiree who had a service-connected total disability at the time of death but
whose death was not the result of his/her service-connected disability. The survivor qualifies if the retiree
112                                                      AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


was continuously rated totally disabled for a period of 10 or more years immediately preceding death, or
the retiree was so rated for a period of not less than 5 years from the date of discharge from military ser-
vice. Payments under this provision are subjected to offset by the amount received from judicial proceed-
ings brought on account of the retiree’s death. DIC is not paid if the VA determines that the retiree’s own
misconduct contributed to the death. The monthly DIC rate paid to a surviving spouse of a retiree for
deaths occurring after 1 January 1993 is the same for all pay grades. The DIC amount paid for a spouse
with one or more children of the deceased retiree is increased for each child. The amount of the DIC pay-
ment for parents varies according to the number of parents, the amount of their individual or combined
total annual income, and whether they live together or, if remarried, live with a spouse. DIC payments to
a surviving spouse are payable for life, as long as the spouse does not remarry. Should the surviving
spouse remarry, payments are terminated, but may be restored if the subsequent marriage ends in death,
divorce or annulment. See VAP 80-XX-1* *NOTE: The second two digits represent the year of publica-
tion.
for additional information.
      4.57.1. To apply for DIC complete the appropriate claim application as listed in Table 4.3.
      4.57.2. Mail the original claim application and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in
      Table 4.3., to the VARO.

4.58. Non-Service-Connected Death Pension. If the VARO determines that the NOK is not eligible for
DIC, they may be eligible to apply for a non-service-connected death pension. Surviving spouses of
deceased members with wartime service and unmarried children under age 18, age 23 if attending a
VA-approved school, may be eligible for this pension if they meet income limitations prescribed by law.
Qualifying children who become incapable of self-support because of a disability before age 18 may be
eligible for a pension as long as the condition exists, unless the child marries or the child’s income
exceeds the income limit. The rate of pension depends on the amount of income the surviving spouse or
child receives from other sources. A pension is not payable to those whose estates are so large that it is
reasonable to assume the estate will maintain them financially. The VA will determine their eligibility.
See VAP 80-XX-1*, for additional information. *NOTE: The second two digits represent the year of pub-
lication.
      4.58.1. To apply for a non-service-connected death pension, eligible survivors should visit their local
      VA office to complete the appropriate claim application as listed in Table 4.3.
      4.58.2. Survivors will need to provide the supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3.

4.59. SGLI. Retirees rated totally disabled on the date of retirement retain SGLI coverage until the dis-
ability ceased to be total in degree, but not for more than 1 year. Determination and payment of proceeds
are made by the OSGLI under the jurisdiction of the VA. Payment of proceeds to a beneficiary is exempt
from taxation. The insured member may have designated as principal or contingent beneficiary any per-
son, firm, corporation or legal entity, including his/her estate, individually or as a trustee. If the member
designated a trust, he/she indicated the name and date of the trust in the beneficiary block. If the member
designated a trust through a will, he/she annotated “Last Will and Testament” in the beneficiary block. If
the member chose not to designate a specific beneficiary but preferred the proceeds be paid in the order of
precedence, the member selected the “By Law” designation.
      4.59.1. When the “By Law” designation is used, the proceeds are automatically paid in the following
      order of precedence:
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                    113


       4.59.1.1. The member’s lawful surviving spouse.
       4.59.1.2. If there is no spouse, to the child or children of the member in equal shares, with the
       shares of any deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child.
       4.59.1.3. If none of the above, to the parents of the member in equal shares or to the surviving par-
       ent.
       4.59.1.4. If none of the above, to the duly appointed legal representative of the member’s estate.
       4.59.1.5. If none of the above, to the person(s) determined to be entitled under the laws of the
       state in which the member was domiciled.
   4.59.2. For additional information on beneficiaries, see paragraph 8.8. of this AFI and VA Handbook,
   for additional information.
   4.59.3. If the retiree was covered under SGLI, complete the claim form as listed in Table 4.3.
   4.59.4. Mail the original claim form and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table
   4.3., to OSGLI, 209 Mt. Pleasant Ave, Livingston NJ 07039-2747.

4.60. Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI). This program allows retirees, upon retirement, to con-
vert their SGLI coverage during the first 120 days following retirement, or 1 year following retirement for
totally disabled retirees. VGLI is a 5-year renewable term policy, administered by the OSGLI under the
jurisdiction of the VA. VGLI is issued up to the maximum allowed by law for SGLI, but not for more than
the amount of SGLI the retiree had in force at the time of retirement.
   4.60.1. See the Servicemembers’ and Veterans’ Group Life Insurance Handbook, for additional
   information.
   4.60.2. If the retiree was covered under VGLI, complete the claim form as listed in Table 4.3.
   4.60.3. Mail the original claim form and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table
   4.3., to OSGLI, 209 W. Mt. Pleasant Ave., Livingston NJ 07039-2747.

4.61. SDVI. SDVI is life insurance limited to veterans who left the Service after 24 April 1951. A mem-
ber who had a service-connected disability but was otherwise in good health could apply to the VA for up
to $10,000 in SDVI life insurance coverage at standard rates. Members rated totally disabled by the VA
could apply for a waiver of premiums. For those members eligible for this waiver, additional coverage of
up to $20,000 is available, but the premiums cannot be waived. See VAP 80-XX-1* for additional infor-
mation. *NOTE: The second two digits represent the year of publication.
   4.61.1. If the retiree was covered under SDVI, complete the claim form as listed in Table 4.3.
   4.61.2. Mail the original claim form and copies of any supporting documentation, as listed in Table
   4.3., to the VARO and Insurance Center, Box 8079, Philadelphia PA 19101.

4.63. Veterans’ Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) and Montgomery GI Bill Refunds. T h e
VA will pay a special death benefit to a designated survivor in the event of the service-connected death of
an individual within 1 year after discharge or release. The deceased must either have been entitled to edu-
cational assistance under these programs or a participant in the programs who would have been so entitled
but for the high school diploma or length-of-service requirement. The amount paid will be equal to the
participant’s actual military pay reduction less any education benefits paid. If the retiree contributed to
these programs, the NOK may be entitled to the death benefit. The death benefit is paid to the SGLI ben-
eficiary. The CAR should submit a letter, along with the SGLI Certificate (SGLV 8286) and a copy of the
DD Form 1300 as listed in Table 4.3., to the appropriate VARO listed below. See VAP 80-XX-1*, for
additional benefit information. *NOTE: The second two digits represent the year of publication.

4.64. Social Security Payments. Social Security monthly benefits are paid to a spouse or a divorced
spouse, age 60 or over; a spouse or divorced spouse regardless of age with children of the decedent under
age 16 or disabled in their care and meeting Social Security requirements. A divorced spouse must have
been married to the servicemember at least 10 years. Monthly payments are also paid to children until age
18, 19 if a full-time student at a primary or secondary school, or age 18 or older if disabled before age 18.
Spouses who wait until age 65 to apply for Social Security receive maximum benefits. However, they can
receive reduced Social Security payments between ages 60 and 65. Dependent parents are eligible for
benefits at age 62 if they were more than 50 percent dependent on the deceased servicemember for their
support. The amount paid can only be determined by the Social Security Administration, which has a
record of the wages earned by the member during the period of both military and civilian employment
under the Social Security Program. To apply for this benefit, eligible survivors should make application
through the nearest Social Security Office. This office will explain the benefit, determine their eligibility,
the amount to be paid, and help them complete the required claim forms. Survivors should apply early, as
the law generally permits retroactive payments of only 12 months. Survivors will need to provide support-
ing documentation as listed in Table 4.3.

4.65. Social Security Lump Sum Death Payment. The Social Security Administration pays a lump
sum death payment, up to $255, to the surviving spouse living with the member at the time of death. Sep-
aration because of military service, is considered living together. If there is no surviving spouse, it is paid
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                      115


to the oldest child who was eligible for or entitled to Social Security benefits during the month of the
member’s death. No other survivors are entitled to this benefit. This benefit is paid even if burial, funeral,
or memorial benefits were paid by the Air Force. To receive this benefit, eligible survivors must make
application through the nearest Social Security Office. This office will explain the benefit, determine their
eligibility, the amount to be paid, and help them complete the required claim forms. Survivors will need
to provide supporting documentation as listed in Table 4.3.

4.66. Other Assistance. The CAR addresses these other matters:
   4.66.1. Living outside the CONUS. If the NOK plan to establish residence outside the CONUS, the
   CAR should:
       4.66.1.1. Advise them that military privileges may or may not be available to them.
       4.66.1.2. Advise them that the government will not pay import duties on items such as household
       goods and automobiles.
       4.66.1.3. Contact the overseas installation nearest the NOK’s planned residence to obtain current
       information about military privileges and import duties, and send the information in writing to the
       NOK (see AFI 24-101).
   4.66.2. Status of Forces Agreements. The CAR should:
       4.66.2.1. Tell NOK living overseas that due to host-country restrictions in Status of Forces
       Agreements, they may have to live independently of the overseas installation.
       4.66.2.2. Summarize the relevant information on the AF IMT 58.
   4.66.3. Fraudulent claims. The CAR should:
       4.66.3.1. Counsel the NOK about possible fraudulent claims against the deceased member's
       estate.
       4.66.3.2. Advise them to refer any suspicious requests for money to the executor of the deceased
       member's estate.
   4.66.4. Uniformed Services Identification (ID) and Privilege Card. The CAR should:
       4.66.4.1. Obtain from the NOK the member’s DD Form 2 (Retired), United States Uniformed
       Services ID Card.
       4.66.4.2. Document the issue and expiration date in the Additional Comments Section of the AF
       IMT 58 and ask the NOK if there are any CHAMPUS or TRICARE claims pending against the
       member's ID card.
       4.66.4.3. Destroy the ID card (cut it up or give it to the MPF customer service element for
       destruction).
       4.66.4.4. Escort the NOK to the MPF customer service element and assist them with applying for
       new ID cards.
   4.66.5. Civilian death certificate: The CAR should:
       4.66.5.1. Tell the NOK they might need copies of the civilian death certificate in the future.
116                                                       AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


         4.66.5.2. Explain that the Air Force is not authorized to purchase the death certificate for the
         NOK.
         4.66.5.3. Provide the cost of the document and the address of the State Vital Statistics Office or
         Health Department.
         4.66.5.4. Refer the NOK to the funeral director for assistance in obtaining copies of the death cer-
         tificate.

4.67. Additional Casualty Assistance Visits or Contacts: The CAR should:
      4.67.1. Contact the NOK of a deceased retiree at least once every:
         4.67.1.1. 30 days for the first 2 months after a retiree’s death.
         4.67.1.2. 60 days thereafter until the NOK receives all benefits or the case is closed.
      4.67.2. Make additional contacts based on problems encountered and the NOK’s desires.
      4.67.3. Monitor the case for receipt of DIC, unpaid pay and allowances, RSFPP, SBP, or RCSBP and
      Social Security Administration entitlements.
      4.67.4. While it is not mandatory that you personally apply for DIC in each case, it is imperative that
      the NOK be given the opportunity to apply. If local VA or service agencies are not available, it is your
      responsibility to ensure the NOK applies when appropriate.
      4.67.5. When making contact with the NOK:
         4.67.5.1. Give the NOK additional advice regarding benefits, if necessary, and help them file
         claims and applications.
         4.67.5.2. Ask about the status of benefit claims or applications already processed and offer to help
         expedite settlement, if applicable.
         4.67.5.3. Return one-of-a-kind documents (i.e., marriage or birth certificate, or divorce decree) to
         the NOK in person if possible or by certified mail, return receipt requested.
         4.67.5.4. Annotate each contact with the NOK, and summarize relevant information on the AF
         IMT 58, using Attachment 21.

4.68. Administrative Closing of Casualty Assistance Cases.
      4.68.1. Closing casualty assistance cases is an administrative action for control of records and does
      not preclude further assistance to the NOK, such as appealing denials of benefits.
      4.68.2. The CAR follows these procedures:
         4.68.2.1. Close retiree cases, regardless of the installation’s DRAPS capability, 6 months after
         learning of the retiree’s death, on AF IMT 58.
         4.68.2.2. If benefits applied for are denied or delayed by other than an Air Force agency, continue
         to monitor these applications until a final determination has been made.
         4.68.2.3. E-mail or mail the error-free AF IMT 58 to HQ AFPC/DPDXIDL, 550 C Street West,
         Suite 50, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4752, within 5 workdays after learning the NOK has received

       all benefits and entitlements in blocks 10A through 10J. as appropriate, or a final determination
       has been made (see Attachment 21). E-mail address is: afpc.dpdxidl@randolph.af.mil.
          4.68.2.3.1. The first page of the AF IMT 58 is mandatory. The assistance summary on the
          reverse is optional.
          4.68.2.3.2. Retain a copy of the entire form in the case file.
          4.68.2.3.3. Ensure all items on the form are properly completed and dates are recorded accu-
          rately.
          4.68.2.3.4. Ensure items 13 and 14 are signed and dated by the CAR.
          4.68.2.3.5. If more than one installation provided assistance, make sure other family members
          or persons designated beneficiaries applied for and received the benefits.
          4.68.2.3.6. Keep proof of e-mail transmission to HQ AFPC/DPDXIDL on file with the signed
          AF IMT 58 in the case file.

4.69. Maintenance of Casualty Assistance Case Files:
   4.69.1. Maintain casualty assistance case files in accordance with AFI 37-138.
   4.69.2. Establish case files for each casualty and file them alphabetically.
   4.69.3. Case files must contain:
       4.69.3.1. A chronological record of contacts, listed on AF IMT 58, in item 11, with:
          4.69.3.1.1. NOK.
          4.69.3.1.2. Other family members and persons designated as beneficiaries, if applicable.
          4.69.3.1.3. Other government agencies.
          4.69.3.1.4. Civilian agencies.
       4.69.3.2. CAR’s actions on behalf of the NOK.
       4.69.3.3. Copies of all messages, memorandums, and claim forms sent to other agencies and the
       NOK.
       4.69.3.4. Any other relevant documents.
   4.69.4. Installations reporting casualties only. Installations reporting retiree deaths but having no
   assistance responsibilities should establish an interim case file for each casualty reported, and destroy
   the case file 6 months after the date of death (AF RDS, table 36-03, rule 02.00).

4.70. Disposition of Casualty Assistance Case Files. Dispose of casualty case files IAW AF Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located HTTPS://WEBRIMS.AMC.AF.MIL/RDS/INDEX.cfm, Records
Disposition Schedule.

4.71. Processing RSFPP, SBP or RCSBP Annuity Payment When a Retiree Is Missing. A n S B P
beneficiary may apply for an annuity if the participating member’s retired pay has been suspended
because the member is missing.
   4.71.1. See paragraph 4.52. through 4.54. for RSFPP and SBP information.
118                                                        AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


      4.71.2. DFAS-CL suspends a missing retiree's retired pay, but the CAR may begin processing annu-
      ity claims if the retiree is an RSFPP or SBP participant. NOTE: This procedure is not officially casu-
      alty assistance since there is no legal determination of death.
      4.71.3. Due to the unique circumstances of these cases, the CAR should immediately telephone HQ
      AFPC/DPFCS at DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048 for guidance on each case.
      4.71.4. Since it is not officially casualty assistance, do not start a case file or track annuity payment.
      4.71.5. The CAR helps the beneficiary collect and submit evidence that:
         4.71.5.1. The retiree has been missing for at least 30 days.
         4.71.5.2. A reasonable person would conclude that the retiree is dead.
         4.71.5.3. Such evidence must include:
             4.71.5.3.1. A statement signed by the applicant describing the circumstances of the retiree's
             disappearance.
             4.71.5.3.2. Supporting documents such as:
                 4.71.5.3.2.1. A police missing person report.
                 4.71.5.3.2.2. Signed statements from persons who last saw the retiree alive.
                 4.71.5.3.2.3. A detailed description of the geographical location, local weather conditions,
                 and the mental and physical condition of the retiree, with a statement regarding the retiree's
                 chance of surviving.
      4.71.6. DFAS/JA determines whether to start RSFPP or SBP annuity payments. A decision to begin
      payments does not constitute a legal determination of death.
      4.71.7. The date the Air Force suspended retired pay will be considered the date of death for payment
      purposes.
      4.71.8. If the retiree participated in RSFPP or SBP, the CAR:
         4.71.8.1. Completes the claim forms as listed in Table 4.3.
         4.71.8.2. Mails the original claim forms, with copies of any supporting documentation as listed in
         Table 4.3., to Defense Finance and Accounting Service, U. S. Military Annuitant Pay, P. O. Box
         7131, London KY 40742-7131.
      4.71.9. Contacts the base FSO to check on the payment status of the RSFPP or SBP annuity prior to
      checking with DFAS.
      4.71.10. If the Air Force later declares the retiree deceased, the CAR performs the appropriate casu-
      alty reporting and assistance.

  CIRCUMSTANCE AND CONDOLENCE LETTERS, AND DOCUMENTATION ON CAUSE
            AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF DEATH OR MISSING STATUS

Section 5A—Circumstance Letter

5.1. Overview. The Air Force ensures that the NOK/interested persons listed on the member’s vRED or
DD Form 93 are informed of the circumstances whenever a military member is declared deceased or
missing.

5.2. When to Send a Circumstance Letter.
   5.2.1. Circumstance letters provide the NOK with as much information as possible concerning events
   leading up to and surrounding the death or missing status of a member.
   5.2.2. Letters are always sent to the NOK when members are declared missing.
   5.2.3. Letters for members declared deceased are sent to the NOK who are:
       5.2.3.1. Unaware of the circumstances.
       5.2.3.2. Notified of the casualty by an unofficial source such as another family member or friend
       of the casualty.
       5.2.3.3. Notified by an Air Force notification officer other than the member's commander or des-
       ignated representative.

5.3. When Not to Send a Circumstance Letter.
   5.3.1. Circumstance letters are not sent to the NOK:
       5.3.1.1. When the member is declared DUSTWUN. The responsible commander personally
       informs family members of all circumstances surrounding the member’s status:
       5.3.1.2. Who were present at the time the casualty occurred and are aware of the circumstances.
       5.3.1.3. Who were informed, in person, of the circumstances by the member's commander or a
       designated representative.
       5.3.1.4. Who were informed of the circumstances by an official source other than the Air Force:
           5.3.1.4.1. Applies to an individual or agency in a position of authority such as law enforce-
           ment agencies, physicians or coroners.
       5.3.1.5. Who are children residing with the NOK, unless requested by the NOK.

5.4. Responsibilities.
   5.4.1. Member’s commander:
       5.4.1.1. Circumstance letters are the responsibility of the member’s commander (see Attachment
       25 through Attachment 30):
126                                                        AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


             5.4.1.1.1. For an ANG or USAFR casualty, the commander may offer the member’s squadron
             commander the opportunity to write the circumstance letter. NOTE: Normally, only one cir-
             cumstance letter is required. However, if the commander indicated in the original letter that a
             follow-up would be provided with further details when they became available, then a subse-
             quent letter is required in order to ensure complete circumstances are relayed to the NOK.
         5.4.1.2. Commanders send circumstance letters to the NOK of deceased members within 5 calen-
         dar days from the date the Air Force notified the NOK of the casualty. NOTE: The Air Force pro-
         vides this time frame only to allow commanders sufficient time to evaluate unusual events
         surrounding a casualty and to provide the NOK with as much information as possible. If informa-
         tion is readily available and requires no evaluation, such as a heart attack, it’s expected that the cir-
         cumstance letter will be sent sooner than 5 calendar days.
         5.4.1.3. Commanders send a circumstance letter to NOK within 5 calendar days of:
             5.4.1.3.1. Declaring a member missing (non-hostile) or recommending missing status (hos-
             tile).
             5.4.1.3.2. Terminating a search.
         5.4.1.4. Include the following information in a circumstance letter sent after a search is termi-
         nated (see Attachment 26):
             5.4.1.4.1. The circumstances surrounding the missing status.
             5.4.1.4.2. Details of the extent, duration, and results of the search.
             5.4.1.4.3. Whether electronic surveillance will continue.
             5.4.1.4.4. A statement that the Air Force is compiling a detailed report containing all known
             information concerning the incident:
                 5.4.1.4.4.1. See paragraphs 2.16., 2.17. and 2.18., and Attachment 3, Attachment 4,
                 Attachment 5 and Attachment 6.
         5.4.1.5. Upon receipt and review of the commander’s missing status report, HQ AFPC/DPFCM

                                               Chapter 6

           AIR NATIONAL GUARD AND UNITED STATES AIR FORCE RESERVE

6.1. General Information. This chapter outlines the responsibilities and procedures for reporting the
deaths of ANG and USAFR members in a non-duty status, retired members awaiting pay at age 60 and
assisting their surviving NOK.
   6.1.1. Usually a surviving NOK notifies the member's assigned unit of the member's death.
   6.1.2. In the unusual case where the NOK is not aware of the member's death, the member's com-
   mander notifies the NOK in person.

6.2. Responsibilities.
   6.2.1. Commander of the unit notified of the member's death should:
       6.2.1.1. Determine the member's unit of assignment or other participation or nonparticipation sta-
       tus information. NOTE: HQ ARPC/DPSPE will give you the member's unit of assignment if you
       provide the member's SSN. Call DSN 926-6438 or 1-800-525-0102, extension 71227.
       6.2.1.2. Notify HQ AFPC/DPFCS by telephone at DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048 of ANG
       and USAFR casualties if the member was in a duty status (e.g., ADT, IDT, MPA, RPA, etc.).
       6.2.1.3. Prepare the initial Death Report.
   6.2.2. HQ AFPC/DPFCS notifies the appropriate ANG state headquarters using contact lists provided
   by ANG/DPFOC or HQ ARPC/DPSPE.
   6.2.3. Member's unit commander should:
       6.2.3.1. Ensure that the MPF submits the initial Death Report (RCS: HAF-SV(AR)9471) (see
       Attachment 35), within 24 hours of learning of the member’s death.
       6.2.3.2. Make every effort to notify the NOK in person, if they are not aware of the member's
       death.
       6.2.3.3. Help the NOK apply for benefits.
       6.2.3.4. Ensure the MPF prepares and distributes documentation (see paragraphs 5.17. through
       5.24. on deaths from injuries or diseases incurred or aggravated while the member was in a duty
       status).
   6.2.4. MPF servicing the member's assigned unit should.
       6.2.4.1. Contact the Services Squadron Mortuary Officer or NCO in accordance with AFI 34-501,
       Mortuary Affairs Program, to determine eligibility for mortuary benefits.
       6.2.4.2. Help commanders with casualty services, including the preparation of initial and supple-
       mental Death Reports.
       6.2.4.3. Report casualties by inputting proper transaction into MilPDS, producing a "Report of
       Death." NOTE: The "Report of Death" replaces special orders announcing deaths for those states
       that no longer require them.
       6.2.4.4. Forward documents in accordance with Table 6.1.
138                                                      AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


         6.2.4.5. Obtain a statement from the investigating authority if a beneficiary was or might have
         been involved in the member’s death and send it to HQ ARPC/DPSPE.
         6.2.4.6. Develop written casualty reporting instructions.

6.3. Reporting Casualties.
      6.3.1. Submit an initial death report (see Attachment 35), to addressees listed in Table 6.1.
         6.3.1.1. Within 24 hours of learning of the member’s death, the member's assigned unit at the
         time of death prepares the initial report.
             6.3.1.1.1. Unit representative immediately contacts the unit command post, which in turn will
             contact the ANG Readiness Center’s Operations Center (ANG/XOC) at DSN 858-6001, or by
             fax at DSN 858-7505.

         place of death, prepares necessary reports, forwards appropriate documents, and provides casualty
         assistance.
         6.3.1.3. For Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs), the commander of the member’s
         attached unit forwards appropriate documents to HQ ARPC/DPSPE and provides casualty assis-
         tance.
         6.3.1.4. If you don’t have all the necessary data, the member’s commander asks the Air Force unit
         or installation nearest the place of death to verify the death and furnish all relevant data.
         6.3.1.5. Units and installations receiving requests for data must send it to the member's com-
         mander as soon as possible.
         6.3.1.6. Follow these steps to report the death of an ANG or USAFR general officer:
             6.3.1.6.1. Immediately telephone HQ AFPC/DPFCS at DSN 665-3505 or 1-800-433-0048.

8.3. Minimum Counseling Information for Members Making SGLI Elections.
   8.3.1. Special counseling is required by Title 38, United States Code, Section 1967(d). This counsel-
   ing is intended to inform members of their insurance benefits, the rationale behind those benefits, and
   the general availability of commercial alternatives. It is intended to stimulate consideration of per-
   sonal insurance requirements in the context of overall estate planning. General, not detailed or com-
   prehensive, information is required by this provision of law. The required counseling should be
   conducted at the time initial SGLI coverage is elected, even if the automatic maximum level of cover-
   age is retained, and upon the occasion of any election to increase or decrease the level of SGLI cover-
   age in effect. The following information will be provided as a minimum:
   8.3.2. Purpose and role of life insurance. Life insurance can serve a number of purposes, but the prin-
   cipal role is to ease the financial burden imposed on survivors when a member dies before achieving
   the financial strength needed to cover the expenses associated with death and any associated loss of
   income to those financially dependent on the member. Since everyone eventually dies, many people
   plan to become financially secure by a certain age. This is achieved through a savings or investment
   program. Generally, persons with a family require more insurance during the period of time their fam-
   ily is young. Extra money would be needed to meet childcare, education, and personal expenses for
   their dependent children. Thus, as their children reach adulthood, their future expenses begin to
   diminish while their financial strength has increased. As a result, they may need less insurance, having
   reached a point of long-term financial stability.
   8.3.3. Term insurance versus whole life insurance. There are several types of life insurance, but the
   two principal types are term and whole life. Term insurance covers a limited period of time while
   whole life covers an indefinite period, or the insured person’s whole life. While term insurance may
   be renewable past the established period of coverage, premiums for the new period will likely be
   increased to cover the higher risk of death as the insured person gets older. Thus, while people are
   young, premiums for term insurance are generally low, but can be expected to increase substantially
   for persons age 60 to 70. Many term policies stop at age 70 or thereabouts. Because the life expect-
   ancy for Americans is in the range of 70 to 80 years of age, many people strive to achieve long-term
   financial stability by that age. They may stop their term policies and rely on their investments and per-
   manent income to meet the limited needs, which remain. Although SGLI and VGLI are considered to
   be term-type life insurance policies, they are "renewable for life" unlike many commercial term poli-
   cies. Premiums for whole life insurance depend on the age at which the policy is purchased, but gen-
   erally do not increase. However, the premiums are initially greater than term insurance premiums at
   the same age, but then in later years the premiums are less than term policies at that age. During the
   early years of a whole life policy, when higher premiums are being paid, the policy may carry a cash
   value because the premiums paid exceed the actual cost of coverage. At some point, the cash value
150                                                         AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


      may grow large enough that no more premiums need to be charged in order to assure a given "face
      value" of the policy for life. If the insured takes this option, the policy is paid up for their whole life.
      8.3.4. SGLI and VGLI. Another important benefit of SGLI insurance is the ability to convert to VGLI
      after leaving the military. VGLI can be taken in the amount of SGLI the member has at the time of
      separation or a lesser amount. It can be retained for life or converted to permanent commercial insur-
      ance with the extra costs underwritten by the SGLI program. Unless totally disabled, SGLI coverage
      will terminate at the end of the 120-day period following separation, but the SGLI level of coverage
      may be maintained through VGLI. If totally disabled, a member should write to the OSGLI and pro-
      vide medical evidence of their disability to find out if they qualify for an extension of their SGLI cov-
      erage for 1 year from the date of separation or the date their disability ends, whichever comes first.
      VGLI can be applied for up to 1 year following the 120-day period, but evidence of good health will
      be required. The cost of VGLI increases with each new 5-year age group, becoming significantly
      more expensive after age 65. Thus, VGLI is similar to most other term insurance programs.
      8.3.5. Commercial insurance. Almost anyone on active duty or in the Ready Reserve should be qual-
      ified to buy a commercial life insurance policy at reasonable cost. It all depends on the company and
      type of policy desired. Many military associations provide term insurance at a group rate. Because
      they may screen applicants for health and high-risk practices like smoking, flying, parachute jumping,
      premiums can be fairly competitive, while allowing for some profit. Some associations offer the
      insurance more as a benefit than as a money-making proposition and this helps keep premiums down.
      However, the SGLI premiums are the same for everyone, regardless of the risk factors involved and
      there is no clause for wartime death. Some private policies may not pay in the event of a war casualty
      or if there is no war clause, the company may not have the financial resources to pay if war casualties
      are high
      8.3.6. Family Member Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance. Expands SGLI coverage to insurable
      spouses and children.
         8.3.6.1. If member is covered under SGLI, spouse and children (including step and adopted) cov-
         erage is automatic. Member may elect to decline or reduce FSGLI for their spouse in writing
         (SGLV 8286A), but children’s coverage is free and cannot be declined unless the member is not
         covered under SGLI.
         8.3.6.2. The amount of spouse coverage cannot exceed the amount of coverage held by the mem-
         ber or $100,000 whichever is less. The amount of coverage for children is $10,000 each.
         8.3.6.3. Military members married to other military members covered under SGLI are also eligi-
         ble for FSGLI coverage.
         8.3.6.4. By law, the military member is the sole beneficiary for FSGLI coverage.
             8.3.6.4.1. Only one parent can receive insurance proceeds for a child.
             8.3.6.4.2. If there is a dispute over which military parent is the beneficiary of the child cover-
             age, the spouse who first became eligible for SGLI will be beneficiary.
         8.3.6.5. The cost for spouse coverage is based on the age of the spouse. Refer to current cost
         charts provided by the VA for current cost information at www.insurance.va.gov or
         www.afpc.randolph.af.mil/casualty.

      8.3.6.6. Spouse and children’s coverage continues free for 120 days from the date of termination
      of coverage. Spouse coverage can be converted to a permanent civilian policy during the 120-day
      grace period following termination of coverage. Provisions for conversion to a civilian policy are
      the same as for SGLI coverage. Coverage for children cannot be converted to a civilian policy.
      8.3.6.7. When a covered family member dies, the CAR is responsible for completing and verify-
      ing the family member information and completing the SGLV 8283A and SGLV 8700. The CAR
      will forward the completed forms, along with any required documentation to HQ AFPC/DPFCS
      for certification prior to being sent to OSGLI for payment.
      8.3.6.8. Reserve and Guard units will report the death of a covered family member by sending
      completed SGLV 8283A and SGLV 8700 to HQ ARPC/DPSPE, 6170 E. Irvington Place, Denver
      CO 80280-4000, for certification prior to being forwarded to OSGLI for payment.

8.4. MPF Customer Service Element Actions..
   8.4.1. When an SGLV 8286 and SGLV 8286A are properly completed, three copies must be signed

      duty. Particularly important are the elections by members to cancel or decline insurance.
          8.4.3.3.1. Make one diagonal line through the old form and annotate: “Replaced by new form
          dated (date of new form).”

8.8. SGLI Beneficiaries..
      8.8.1. An insured member may designate as principal beneficiary or contingent beneficiary any per-
      son, firm, corporation or legal entity (including the member’s estate), individually or as a trustee.
      8.8.2. The following are guidelines to be used in the preparation of the SGLV 8286:
         8.8.2.1. A member should be encouraged to name a specific beneficiary.
             8.8.2.1.1. Use of the “By Law” designation should be discouraged.
         8.8.2.2. If a member does not want to designate a specific beneficiary but prefers the proceeds to
         be paid in the order of precedence, the member should enter “By Law” by his or her own hand
         (printed or cursive) in the appropriate space in part 2 of the form.
             8.8.2.2.1. The insurance proceeds will automatically be paid in the following order of prece-
             dence:
                 8.8.2.2.1.1. Surviving spouse of member.
                 8.8.2.2.1.2. Child or children of the member, in equal shares, with the share of any
                 deceased child to be distributed among the descendants of that child.
                 8.8.2.2.1.3. Parents in equal shares, or all to the surviving parent. NOTE: Biological par-
                 ents are not always who the member intended to receive the proceeds, and in cases of
                 abandonment, they are not always recognized as legal parents. Claim disputes involving
                 the recognition of “rightful” parents can be avoided by discouraging the use of “By Law”
                 designations and listing the parent(s) by name.
                 8.8.2.2.1.4. A duly appointed executor or administrator of the member’s estate.
                 8.8.2.2.1.5. Other family member.
      8.8.3. When a member is likely to be survived by a spouse, children, or parents and designates some
      other person or entity as beneficiary, an MPF customer service element or CSS representative should:
         8.8.3.1. Counsel the member to the fact that the SGLI law was specifically designed to provide
         some form of security for spouse, children or parents.
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                     155


       8.8.3.2. Encourage the member to designate spouse, children, or parents as beneficiaries.
       8.8.3.3. If the unusual designation is to be continued, a memorandum indicating that this was dis-
       cussed with the member should be placed in Section I of the member’s UPRG as a matter of
       record.
       8.8.3.4. Under no circumstances should a member be compelled to designate any beneficiary
       other than one of their own choosing.
   8.8.4. When a member wishes to name minors as beneficiaries such as his or her own children, neph-
   ews, nieces, etc., the member should be advised that the proceeds of the insurance cannot be paid to a
   minor beneficiary, other than a minor surviving spouse, without a court-appointed guardian.
       8.8.4.1. The appointment of a guardian is often time-consuming and costly and, for that reason,
       may delay the payment of proceeds.
       8.8.4.2. The amount of the proceeds can be materially reduced by the payment of court costs,
       attorney fees and expenses incurred by the guardian. One way to avoid such complications and
       expense is to designate a pre-appointed trustee of the minor beneficiary.

8.9. Terminally Ill Death Benefit.. Section 302 of the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998,
Public Law 105-368, amended chapter 19 of Title 38, U.S.C. to allow terminally ill members to receive
Accelerated Benefits Option (ABO). Anyone who is insured by SGLI, or VGLI and who is terminally ill
is eligible for this benefit. Terminally ill means that a medical doctor has certified that the insured has 9
months or less to live. Up to 50 percent of the face value of a servicemembers’ or veterans’ SGLI or VGLI
coverage may be paid as an accelerated benefit, up to $100,000 during their lifetime. The accelerated ben-
efits are paid in a lump sum only and are exempt from taxation. If an insured wants less than 50 percent of
the face value, it will be paid in $5000 increments only.
   8.9.1. Servicemembers with FSGLI coverage have access to up to 50% of the face value of the spou-
   sal coverage through the ABO. The ABO is available in $5,000 increments. In order to qualify, the
   spouse must have a medical prognosis of life expectancy of 9 months or less. This benefit will be paid
   only to the servicemember.
   8.9.2. Personnel wanting to claim this benefit should provide a letter from their attending physician to
   the OSGLI stating the member or spouse is terminally ill, with prognosis of life expectancy of less
   than 9 months.
   8.9.3. If accelerated benefits are paid, the remaining SGLI/VGLI/FSGLI coverage will be reduced
   correspondingly with the amount of accelerated benefits paid and the insured must continue to pay
   premiums on the remaining coverage.
       8.9.3.1. When accelerated benefits are paid to an active duty member, they must visit the MPF
       customer support section and complete a new form SGLV 8286/SGLV 8286A for the remaining
       coverage.

8.10. Election of Method for Payment of Insurance Proceeds..
   8.10.1. An insured member may elect the proceeds of SGLI be paid to the beneficiary in a lump-sum
   payment or in 36 equal monthly installments.
156                                                        AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


         8.10.1.1. An insured may also change the method of settlement at any time without the consent of
         the beneficiary.
      8.10.2. If the insured member elects a lump-sum payment or makes no election, the beneficiary may
      choose either the lump-sum settlement or payment in 36 monthly installments.
      8.10.3. If the insured member elects 36 monthly installments, the beneficiary may not elect a
      lump-sum payment.

8.11. Payment of SGLI Proceeds.
      8.11.1. The Alliance Account. Effective 1 June 1999 a Prudential Alliance Account became the stan-
      dard method of payment for all OSGLI claims except those listed below, which will be made via
      check:
         8.11.1.1. Installments.
         8.11.1.2. Claims of less than $5,000.
         8.11.1.3. Payments to beneficiaries residing in foreign countries.
         8.11.1.4. Claims that require certified checks.
         8.11.1.5. Proceeds payable to multiple parties (i.e., co-executors, co-guardians).
         8.11.1.6. Guardianship claims:
             8.11.1.6.1. That are joint with the court.
             8.11.1.6.2. When the bank is the trustee.
             8.11.1.6.3. That require deposit into another bank.
             8.11.1.6.4. That require dual signatures.
             8.11.1.6.5. That require deposit into the court.
      8.11.2. How it works. The Prudential Alliance Account is a personalized interest-bearing checking
      account for beneficiaries of group life insurance proceeds of $5,000 or more. When a claim is
      approved by OSGLI for payment, life insurance benefits will automatically be placed in the Alliance
      Account in the name of the beneficiary. The beneficiary can withdraw all or part of the proceeds
      immediately or leave the funds in the account to earn interest from the date the Alliance Account is
      opened.
         8.11.2.1. As soon as the account is opened, the beneficiaries are mailed an Alliance Account Kit.
         This information package includes:
             8.11.2.1.1. A cover letter.
             8.11.2.1.2. A certificate outlining the terms and conditions of the account, including amount
             deposited, initial interest rate and yield.
             8.11.2.1.3. A user-friendly brochure explaining the Alliance Account.
             8.11.2.1.4. An information request form which incorporates a Tax Identification Number/
             W-9 Certification for social security number verification.
             8.11.2.1.5. A beneficiary designation form.
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                      157


          8.11.2.1.6. 15 checks (additional checks may be ordered at no cost).
       8.11.2.2. When the kit is mailed, a representative will call the beneficiary to explain that it will be
       arriving in a few days. With permission from the beneficiary, the representative will call a second
       time, after the kit has been received, to verify information and address any questions or concerns.
   8.11.3. Advantages for recipients. This procedure allows recipients more time to make financial deci-
   sions during a difficult period. Recipients will have immediate access to their funds through the
   checking account (withdrawals are subject to a $250 minimum). In addition, funds in the account earn
   interest from the date the Alliance Account is opened. This interest is comparable to rates earned on
   6-month certificates of deposit. The interest is compounded daily and credited monthly. Interest rates
   may change monthly but at no time will the interest fall below the guaranteed minimum rate of two
   percent.
   8.11.4. Customer service. Prudential has an Alliance Account Service Center exclusively dedicated
   to answering beneficiary questions about the account. The staff at the Center has on-line access infor-
   mation. The representatives are available at 1-800-353-4160 or 1-877-255-4262, Monday through Fri-
   day, 0800-2000, Eastern Standard Time.

8.12. Processing Requests for SGLI Premium Reimbursement..
   8.12.1. When a member claims SGLI premium deductions exceed the level of coverage, review the
   member’s SGLV 8285 and/or SGLV 8286, and DFAS Military Leave and Earnings Statement (LES).
   8.12.2. If reimbursement of premiums is warranted, fax a copy of the SGLV 8286, LES, and update
   verification to HQ AFPC/DPFCS at DSN: 665-2348 and open a Case Management System (CMS)
   case and refer it to AFPC/DPFCS.
       8.12.2.1. Include the member’s name, rank, SSN, and an explanation of circumstances.
       8.12.2.2. EXAMPLE:. Per SGLV 8286 on file in the member’s UPRG, he elected $100,000 cov-
       erage on 1 May 04. Member’s LES for the months of Jun and Jul 04 reflect a deduction for
       $250,000, and MilPDS reflects the correct level of coverage, which supports a reimbursement.

8.13. Application for Correction of Military Record..
   8.13.1. When a member requests reimbursement for overpayment of premium deductions for any rea-
   son other than the MPF erroneously updating the wrong election, and all other administrative reme-
   dies are exhausted, the member should:
       8.13.1.1. Complete DD Form 149, Application for Correction of Military Record.
       8.13.1.2. Mail the DD Form 149 to the Secretary of the Air Force, Review Board Office (SAF/
       MRBR), 550 C Street West, Suite 46, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4722.

8.14. Information Collections, Records, and Forms/IMTs..

Terms
NOTE: These definitions are for the purpose of this AFI only. See Joint Publication 1-02, DoD Dictio-
nary of Military and Associated Terms, for the official DoD definition of many of these terms. Through-
out this AFI, the word “member” refers to military or retired personnel and the word “person” refers to
either civilian or military personnel.
Active Air Force—Members of the Air Force, United States Air Force Academy Cadets, and Air
National Guard and United States Air Force Reserve members serving on extended active duty (i.e., they
are assigned to an active duty unit and their accountability is against active force strength).
Active Duty (AD)—Full-time duty in the active Military Service of the United States. This includes
members of Reserve components serving on active duty or full-time training duty, but does not include
full-time National Guard duty. AD for Air National Guard is always performed in a Title 10, United
States Code (U.S.C.) federal status. Active duty includes active duty for training and active duty other
than for training.
Active Duty for Training (ADT)—A tour of active duty which is used for training members of Reserve
components to provide trained units and qualified persons to fill the needs of the Armed Forces in time of
war or national emergency and such other times as the national security requires. The member is under
orders that provide for return to non-active status when the period of active duty for training is completed.
It includes annual training, special tours of active duty for training, school tours, and the initial duty for
training performed by nonprior service enlistees. ADT for Air National Guard is always performed in a
Title 10, U.S.C. federal status and may be referred to as annual training, special training, formal school
training, and initial active duty for training. Active duty for training can be training under Title 10, U.S.C.,
Section 12301(b). This duty may satisfy the requirement for an individual to perform 15 days of active
service for training per fiscal year.
Active Duty Other than for Training—A category of active duty used to provide Reserve component
support to either active component or Reserve component missions. It includes the categories of active
duty for special work, active Guard/Reserve duty in Title 10, U.S.C. status, and involuntary active duty in
accordance with Title 10, U.S.C., Sections 12301, 12302, and 12304. Training may occur in the conduct
of active duty other than for training. Active duty other than for training in support of the active
component is usually supported by Military Personnel Appropriation man-days.
Active Service—Service on active duty or full-time National Guard duty.
Annuity—The monthly or annual payment a beneficiary receives.
AGATE—A patient is making normal improvement.
Beneficiary—The individual who is entitled to receive certain benefits either by law or written
designation of the servicemember.
BROKE—A patient is evacuated from an overseas medical treatment facility (MTF) to a continental
United States (CONUS) MTF.
Casualty—Any person who is lost to the organization by having been declared dead, duty status—
whereabouts unknown (DUSTWUN), missing, ill, or injured.
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                  169


Casualty Assistance Representative (CAR)—The person at the Air Force installation responsible for
reporting deaths and assisting survivors.
Casualty Augmentation Support Team (CAST)—A group of individuals trained in casualty reporting,
notification, and assistance procedures that help the CAR and other casualty personnel. The size of the
team is at the MPF commander's discretion and depends on the size and mission of the installation it
serves.
Casualty Category—Used to specifically classify a casualty for reporting purposes. HQ AFPC/DPFC
bases the categories on casualty type and status. Casualty categories include beleaguered, besieged,
captured, detained, died of wounds received in action, interned, killed in action, missing, missing in
action, and wounded in action.
Casualty Status—Used to classify a casualty for reporting purposes. There are seven casualty statuses:
deceased, DUSTWUN, missing, very seriously ill or injured (VSI), seriously ill or injured (SI),
incapacitating illness or injury (III), or not seriously ill or injured (NSI).
Casualty Type—Used to identify a casualty for reporting purposes as either a hostile casualty or a
nonhostile casualty.
Civilian Employee—A civilian employee hired in the US and assigned overseas. The Air Force pays
civilian employees from Department of the Air Force or DoD appropriated or nonappropriated funds. A
civilian employee must be either a US citizen or a permanent resident alien.
Continental United States (CONUS)—United States territory, including the adjacent territorial waters,
located within North America between Canada and Mexico. When used for ANG casualties, the term
applies to the geographical limits of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and
the Virgin Islands.
CRIMP—A patient is not recovering satisfactorily.
Date of Death—Either the date a person died as determined by actual knowledge of the death, a date the
Air Force determines based on conclusive evidence, or the date the Air Force declares a person dead
based on a presumptive finding of death. Laws on brain death differ among states and countries. The Air
Force determines the date of death based on local law and on when doctors declare a person brain dead or
remove life support systems. When the Air Force determines that a DUSTWUN member has died, the
official date of death is the date the Air Force declared the member DUSTWUN, unless conclusive
evidence establishes a later date. The date of death for missing persons depends on either conclusive
evidence of death or a presumptive finding of death. The Service secretary, an appointed designee, or a
medical authority determines the date of death based on conclusive evidence. The date of death based on
a presumptive finding of death is the date the Service secretary or an appointed designee signs the change
in casualty status from missing to deceased.
Death Certificate (Military)—The official DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty, published by
Headquarters, United States Air Force. The DD Form 1300 is used to provide an official record of the
death of a military member. The form may be used in place of a civilian death certificate when proof of
death is necessary. Government agencies and most commercial life insurance companies use the DD
Form 1300 as the basis for paying benefits. It may be used to facilitate the cashing of bonds or in the
settlement of any other claim in which proof of death is required.

Deceased—A casualty status applicable to a person who is either known to have died, determined to have

                                   SAMPLE WITNESS STATEMENT
On 5 February 1991, I was pilot of an F-15C flying MIG cover for Shark 01, piloted by Colonel Barry T.
Smith. Prior to reaching the target area, at approximately 0720L, I observed a MIG-25 making a
high-speed attack on Colonel Smith's aircraft. As I dove to intercept, I alerted Colonel Smith and
instructed him to break hard right. As Shark 01 began his break, the enemy fire hit him. I observed both
Colonel Smith and Lieutenant Colonel Irwin ejecting and that they had good parachutes. I continued in
pursuit of the MIG, got radar lock, and fired my missile, destroying the aircraft. I then returned to the inci-
dent location. At that time, I received bogey dope on inbound bandits and we were receiving a lot of
radar-guided flak. We did not conduct an organized search due to the intense enemy flak and aircraft in
the area. I saw both Colonel Smith and Irwin on the ground in what seemed to be good condition.

FROM: (Organization Mailing Address)
SUBJECT: 9-Month Investigation Report on a Missing Person
       This 9-month investigation report pertains to Major Roger C. Smith, 023-45-6789, missing from
Eglin AFB FL since 15 May 1997. I am forwarding it IAW AFI 36-3002, Casualty Services, Chapter 2.
        The initial circumstances surrounding the loss of Major Smith in an Eglin AFB Aeroclub Cessna
172 aircraft incident remain unchanged. We have maintained close contact with Air Force, state, and fed-
eral investigative agencies in an attempt to establish Major Smith's true status. However, all follow-up
actions have been negative. The only supplemental information you haven't received in subsequent
reports is that on 14 December 1997, the Federal Aviation Administration office in Pensacola FL thought
a dredging machine had recovered the tail section of the missing aircraft in a body of water adjacent to
Eglin AFB. Further analysis revealed it was from a Piper Cub rather than a Cessna.
       I based my decision to place Major Smith in a missing status on my belief that he probably
encountered severe weather soon after his departure on a routine night training flight, and that the aircraft
crashed within 20 miles of Eglin AFB. Given his outstanding physical condition, I felt it was possible for
him to survive on one of the small islands in the area, even if injured, until located by search and rescue
personnel or recreational boaters or fishermen. Considering the passage of time without any information
from or about Major Smith or anything whatsoever concerning the missing aircraft, it now appears that
Major Smith did not survive the crash of his aircraft, which apparently occurred over water. Accordingly,
I recommend that the Air Force change the status of Major Roger C. Smith from missing to deceased.

                      CASUALTY NOTIFICATION OFFICER CHECKLIST

A18.1. Purpose of Notification. To provide dignified, compassionate and humane notification to family
members and other designated persons as promptly as possible after a member is placed in a casualty sta-
tus of deceased, Duty Status-Whereabouts Unknown (DUSTWUN), or Missing.

A18.2. Background.
   A18.2.1. This checklist provides guidance for preparing and completing casualty notifications.
   A18.2.2. A casualty notification will probably be one of the hardest duties you will perform in your
   military career.
   A18.2.3. You must convey, in every action and deed, the sincere concern of the Air Force for the feel-
   ings of the NOK.
   A18.2.4. Your duty as a casualty notification officer is to “soften the blow,” if possible, and to show
   that the Air Force is genuinely concerned about its members and their families.
   A18.2.5. Each notification is unique as a result of the individuals and circumstances surrounding the
   incident. We cannot cover all situations that you might encounter. We hope this checklist will provide
   enough information to assist you in preparing and completing a casualty notification and ease some of
   the anxiety often experienced by individuals when called upon to perform this sensitive task.
   A18.2.6. Remember, nothing can substitute for common sense, good judgment, and sensitivity in
   making a casualty notification.

A18.3. Casualty Notification Responsibility.
   A18.3.1. Air Force Personnel Center, Casualty Services Branch (AFPC/DPFCS) assigns the Air
   Force activity (active Air Force, Air National Guard, United States Air Force Reserve, and Air Force
   Reserve Officer Training Corps) nearest to the next of kin’s (NOK) residence to accomplish the casu-
   alty notification.
   A18.3.2. If the NOK live on or near the member’s home installation, the member’s wing, group,
   squadron commander, or other officer, as determined by the installation commander, effects personal
   notification to the NOK, provides circumstances surrounding the incident and expresses condolences.
   A18.3.3. The casualty notification duty:
       A18.3.3.1. Is on behalf of the Air Force Chief of Staff.
       A18.3.3.2. Has priority over all duties, except in emergencies.
       A18.3.3.3. Is accomplished in service dress uniform with the exception of the medical technician
       who can wear whites (he/she remains in the vehicle).

A18.4. Notification Team Composition.
   A18.4.1. Field grade officers, of equal or higher grade than the member about whom they are making
   notification, are assigned the responsibility for personal notification as directed by the installation
234                                                      AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007


      commander or AFPC, Chief, Casualty Services Branch (AFPC/DPFCS). EXCEPTION: AFPC/
      DPFCS may assign other officers to notification duty.
         A18.4.1.1. Medical personnel (i.e., doctor, nurse, or medical technician) and an Air Force chap-
         lain, if available, accompany the notification officer to attend to any reaction of the NOK.
             A18.4.1.1.1. Notification should not be delayed due to the inability to obtain a medical officer
             or chaplain.
      A18.4.2. The commander or notification officer may invite another person to accompany the notifica-
      tion team such as a friend, co-worker or clergy/leader from the member’s faith community, known by
      the member’s family whose presence may be comforting to the family, if it does not delay the notifi-
      cation process.
      A18.4.3. On active duty installations, notification team members normally assemble in the casualty
      assistance representative’s (CAR) office within 30-45 minutes after receiving the telephone call from
      the CAR.
         A18.4.3.1. In most instances, an error-free notification letter has already been prepared and is
         ready for the notification officer to deliver to the NOK.
         A18.4.3.2. A notification letter is not required when the member’s commander or a designated
         representative personally notifies the NOK.

A18.5. Transportation.
      A18.5.1. The CAR, with help from the vehicle dispatcher, provides a military vehicle, sedan,
      mini-van or other appropriate vehicle for the notification officer.
         A18.5.1.1. Geographically separated unit (GSU) commanders establish arrangements for use of a
         government vehicle if available.
      A18.5.2. Notification officers must use military vehicles when available; otherwise, use of a privately
      owned vehicle (POV) is authorized.
         A18.5.2.1. When travel must be performed using a POV, the notification officer submits SF
         1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business, to their servicing
         financial services office for reimbursement of expenses.
         A18.5.2.2. Reimbursement of expenses is chargeable to unit operation and maintenance (O&M)
         funds.

A18.6. Communication Support.
      A18.6.1. The military personnel flight (MPF) or GSU commander, with the help of support agencies,
      provides a cellular telephone or two-way radio for use by the notification officer or team.
      A18.6.2. The immediate availability to communicate with your installation casualty office and
      AFPC/DPFCS is necessary should you or the team encounter obstacles that prevent effecting and con-
      firming notifications in a timely manner.

A18.7. Preparing to Perform Casualty Notifications.
      A18.7.1. Review the DoD film, Casualty Notification.
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                  235


   A18.7.2. Review AFI 36-3002, Chapter 3, Casualty Notifications.
   A18.7.3. Ensure your service dress uniform is in good condition. You must wear it for all casualty
   notifications.
   A18.7.4. Talk to your servicing MPF CAR to familiarize yourself with the Air Force Casualty Pro-
   gram and any unique local casualty notification procedures.
   A18.7.5. Talk to other field grade officers who have performed a casualty notification. Their experi-
   ences might help you prepare to perform this sensitive task.
   A18.7.6. Understand that your commander could call on you to perform a casualty notification at any
   time: Be prepared.

A18.8. Guidelines During the Pre-notification Phase.
   A18.8.1. Once your installation commander or HQ AFPC//DPFCS selects you for casualty notifica-
   tion duty, learn as much as you can about the casualty, the NOK, and the circumstances surrounding
   the incident.
   A18.8.2. The installation CAR or HQ AFPC/DPFCS will provide you with:
      A18.8.2.1. The notification procedures briefing.
      A18.8.2.2. The notification letter.
          A18.8.2.2.1. If assigned to a military installation, the CAR will give you the appropriate noti-
          fication letter.
          A18.8.2.2.2. If assigned to a GSU, HQ AFPC/DPFCS will fax or e-mail the appropriate noti-
          fication letter for your signature.
              A18.8.2.2.2.1. If faxed, you must retype verbatim and error-free (see AFI 36-3002, Chap-
              ter 3, paragraph 3.16., and Attachment 19 and Attachment 20, for further information).
          A18.8.2.2.3. This letter provides condolences on behalf of the Air Force and known circum-
          stances surrounding the incident.
          A18.8.2.2.4. You will take the original copy of the notification letter when you go to see the
          NOK.
      A18.8.2.3. The NOK’s name, relationship, and address, and any special conditions you will need
      to know (e.g., age, ill health, or precarious location of NOK).
      A18.8.2.4. Instructions if problems occur.
      A18.8.2.5. Map of the area, if available.
      A18.8.2.6. Transportation.

         A18.8.3.1. If you are unsure of the NOK's location, ask the CAR, HQ AFPC/DPFCS, or local
         authorities for help.
         A18.8.3.2. If the NOK reside within an area where your safety may be threatened, request a
         police escort.

A18.9. Inability to Locate the NOK.
      A18.9.1. If it appears the NOK is not at home, you should contact neighbors, law enforcement agen-
      cies, or the local postmaster (not a postal clerk) for information regarding the NOK’s whereabouts.

      immediately telephone HQ AFPC/DPFCS toll-free at 1-800-433-0048 for further guidance and pro-

A18.10. Making the Notification.
      A18.10.1. A representative of the Air Force notifies the NOK in person whenever possible.
      A18.10.2. The Air Force honors the NOK’s wishes to notify other family members. EXAMPLE: If
      the spouse wishes to notify adult children or the parents.
      A18.10.3. If the NOK calls to ask about a member’s status before they receive official notification,
      AFPC/DPFCS, the member’s commander or a designated representative, or the CAR, tells the caller
      the member’s status during the call.
      A18.10.4. You must be alert to the needs of the NOK and represent the Air Force in a professional
      manner.
         A18.10.4.1. Being prepared, sincere, and alert to the needs of the family at time of notification
         will reduce some of the shock that is normal under these circumstances.
      A18.10.5. Stereotyped procedures are not appropriate.
      A18.10.6. As a minimum, you should:
         A18.10.6.1. Identify yourself to the NOK and any other members of the team. EXAMPLE: "I am
         Major Thompson and this is Major Jones from the 12th Mission Support Squadron at Randolph
         Air Force Base, Texas."
         A18.10.6.2. After identifying yourself, make sure you are speaking to the correct person(s) by
         confirming the identity of the NOK. EXAMPLE: "Are you Mr. Thomas Brown, the father of Staff
         Sergeant Carl Brown?"
         A18.10.6.3. If at least one person to be notified is home, you should state that you have an impor-
         tant message to deliver and ask permission to enter the residence.
         A18.10.6.4. Verbally relate to the NOK, without reading from the notification letter, the informa-
         tion contained in the letter, if applicable. EXAMPLE: “On behalf of the Chief of Staff, United
         States Air Force, I regret to inform you that your son, Staff Sergeant Carl Brown, died in Texas
         today as a result of injuries received in a motorcycle accident.” Then paraphrase any additional
         circumstances described in the notification letter.
         A18.10.6.5. Do not hurry the words; speak as naturally as possible.
AFI36-3002_50SWSUP_I 10 OCTOBER 2007                                                                   237


       A18.10.6.6. Do not extend overly sympathetic gestures that may be taken the wrong way.
       A18.10.6.7. Do not physically touch the NOK in any manner other than to assist in an emergency.
       If necessary, summon the medical representative on the team or local emergency personnel.
       A18.10.6.8. Avoid making detailed statements about the incident.
       A18.10.6.9. Inform the NOK that the deceased member’s commander will send a letter explain-
       ing and confirming the circumstances surrounding the incident.
          A18.10.6.9.1. If you are the member’s commander or a designated representative and have
          first-hand knowledge of the circumstances, you may give the NOK additional information.
       A18.10.6.10. Inform the NOK eligible for casualty assistance that a casualty assistance represen-
       tative will contact them within 24 hours to arrange for a casualty assistance visit at their conve-
       nience.
       A18.10.6.11. Inform the NOK that:
          A18.10.6.11.1. For CONUS casualties, a mortuary affairs representative will contact them
          regarding mortuary affairs.
          A18.10.6.11.2. For overseas casualties, HQ Air Force Mortuary Services, San Antonio,
          Texas, will contact them regarding mortuary affairs.
       A18.10.6.12. Give the notification letter to the NOK, if applicable.
       A18.10.6.13. If the NOK have questions or need additional information, have them call HQ
       AFPC/DPFCS toll-free at 1-800-433-0048, and HQ AFPC/DPFCS will put the NOK in touch with
       their (husband’s, wife’s, son’s, daughter’s, father’s, or mother’s) commander.

A18.11. Information You Must Not Discuss With NOK.
   A18.11.1. Questions about survivor benefits, burial, or similar matters.
   A18.11.2. Compensation-related questions dealing with insurance, gratuities, unpaid pay and allow-
   ances. The CAR providing assistance will address these subjects.
   A18.11.3. Questions relating to mortuary affairs. The mortuary affairs representative will address
   these issues.
   A18.11.4. Questions relating to line of duty, negligence, errors in judgment or the responsibility of
   other personnel concerned with the incident.
   A18.11.5. Your prior experiences or personal conjectures.
   A18.11.6. In short, limit your discussion to the information contained in the notification letter and do
   not discuss matters that you are not qualified to discuss.

A18.12. After the Notification.
   A18.12.1. Confirm the NOK’s address is correct and obtain their telephone number for future con-
   tact.
   A18.12.2. Ask the NOK if they wish to personally notify other immediate family members or have
   them notified by the Air Force.

         A18.12.2.2. If the NOK prefers the Air Force notify other family members, telephone HQ AFPC/
         DPFCS at their toll-free number (1-800-433-0048), as soon as possible from the NOK’s area, but
         not from their home, and provide the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of those family
         members.
      A18.12.3. Stay with the NOK as long as needed, but depart the residence in a professional manner
      and within a reasonable period of time.
         A18.12.3.1. If at all possible, do not leave the NOK alone.
         A18.12.3.2. Encourage the NOK to contact a relative, neighbor or friend to stay with them, or ask

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith
       I was very sorry to learn of the death of your son, Lieutenant Colonel Joe P. Smith.
        My office helps the next of kin of Air Force members apply for government benefits they may be
entitled to as the result of a member's death. We have been helping your daughter-in-law, Mrs. Jane M.
Smith, apply for her benefits and privileges.
        In certain circumstances, parents are also eligible for benefits from the Social Security Adminis-
tration and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Based on your son’s earnings, for you to be eligible
for Social Security benefits you must be at least 62 years of age and you must have been dependent on him
for over one-half of your support at the time of his death. If you believe you may be eligible, you should
contact the nearest Social Security office. Your son's social security account number is 123-45-6789.
        Regardless of dependency, if your combined annual income is less than ______ (excluding any
income you are receiving from the VA), you may be eligible for VA Dependency and Indemnity Com-
pensation. This depends on the VA determining that Colonel Smith's death was service related. The VA is
currently deciding this issue on behalf of his widow. If you believe you may be eligible, you should con-
tact the nearest VA office.
        If you have any questions, or if I may be of assistance to you, please do not hesitate to call my
office at (210) 123-4567.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jones
       Please accept my deepest condolences at the tragic death of your daughter,
Sergeant Lori A. Jones on 11 May 1998. Her loss saddened the members of this organization.
        At the time of the accident, Lori was performing her duties as flight engineer on a C-130 aircraft.
The aircraft was scheduled to fly a navigational training mission, taking off from Hill Air Force Base,
Utah, with a scheduled landing at the same base 4 hours later. Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft departed
its controlled flight pattern and crashed in the Wasatch mountains, east of the base.
        Your daughter was a fine Air Force crewmember who was well liked by everyone here in the
wing. Her love of flying led to the establishment of many friendships and associations. We all feel a per-
sonal loss in her untimely death.
       If I can be of further assistance to you, please contact me at (801) 777-XXXX.
                                                     Sincerely

Mrs. Susan A. Hanes

San Antonio, Texas 78232
Dear Mrs. Hanes
        It is with deep regret that I write to inform you that the status of your husband has been changed
from whereabouts unknown to missing. As I have explained, whereabouts unknown is a transitory duty
status which provides a commander with additional time to decide on the most accurate status for a mem-
ber. Since no additional information surfaced during our extensive search for John's aircraft, and I remain
unsure of his true status, I have declared him missing.
        The Air Force continued the search efforts I previously described to you until yesterday, when we
concluded that no evidence remained that search aircraft or naval vessels could detect within the range of
John’s aircraft. We searched an area of approximately 80,000 square miles, with concentrated efforts in
the area that would most likely have contained wreckage. Both the US Air Force and the US Navy dedi-
cated many aircraft to the search. Some commercial airlines and numerous Civil Air Patrol aircraft also
participated in the search. Electronic surveillance of the search area will continue for the next 2 weeks.
Please be assured that if I receive any new information concerning your husband's status, I will notify you
immediately.
        I am compiling a detailed report containing all known information concerning the incident. This
report should be complete within 5 days, at which time I will forward it to the Air Force Missing Persons
Branch. That office will provide you with additional information and will keep you informed of all future
developments concerning John's status.
       If you wish to correspond with the Missing Persons Branch, you may write to AFPC/DPFCM, 550
C Street West, Suite 15, Randolph AFB TX 78150-4717, or call 1-800-531-5501.
        On behalf of John's many friends in the 345th Tactical Fighter Wing, please accept my deepest
condolences during this time of anxiety. If I can be of personal assistance, please contact me at any time
at (210) 652-XXXX.
                                                     Sincerely

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jones
        Please accept my deepest condolences at the tragic death of your son, First Lieutenant Henry A.
Jones, Jr., on 9 May 1998. His loss saddened the members of this organization. I want to explain the cir-
cumstances that led to Henry’s death as we understand them.
        Henry had walked to the bus stop with Stacey and Nicole to see them off to school. After they
were on their way, Henry began jogging and had run for about two blocks when he collapsed. He went
into convulsions and was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation by a passing motorist while an ambulance
was being summoned. Henry was transported to the Good Samaritan Hospital in Tampa, Florida, where
he was pronounced dead on arrival from an apparent heart attack.
       You should be very proud of your son. He was a fine young man who was certainly well liked by
everyone. Henry's achievements were many. His dedication to duty led to the establishment of many
friendships and associations. We all feel a great personal loss in his untimely death.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Jones

Jones, Jr., on 1 June 2003. His loss saddened the members of this organization. I want to explain the cir-
cumstances that led to Henry's death as we understand them.
       Henry and his date were returning to Colorado Springs early Tuesday morning in Henry's car. On
the expressway, just outside the city limits, his car left the southbound lane, went over the curb, and struck
a bridge abutment. All available evidence indicates that both Henry and his date died instantly.
       You should be very proud of your son. He was a fine young man who was certainly well liked by
everyone here. Henry's achievements were many. His love of flying and skiing led him to develop many
friendships and associations. We all feel a great personal loss in his untimely death.

Mrs. John A. Smith
111 Pine Street
San Antonio, Texas 78232
Dear Mrs. Smith
        Please accept my heartfelt condolences on the death of your husband, Major John A. Smith. John
was highly respected by the members of the 111th Fighter Wing, both for his exceptional leadership abil-
ities and his skill as a pilot. I want to explain the circumstances surrounding John’s death as we under-
stand them at this time.
         John departed Riyadh Air Base at 9:00 a.m. on the morning of March 30 to conduct a visual recon-
naissance mission in a heavily defended, hostile area. After completing a series of reconnaissance runs
and accomplishing an in-flight refueling, he returned to the target area to continue his mission. During the
flight, the aircraft encountered enemy gunfire, and the navigator reported that he heard two loud explo-
sions. Despite the navigator’s continued attempts to contact him, no contact was made. The navigator
flew the aircraft to a safe area and elected to eject both himself and John rather than to attempt a landing.
The ejection was successful; however, John had already suffered fatal injuries. It was determined that he
died instantly as a result of enemy ground fire.
       His gallantry on this mission was typical of the outstanding devotion he has demonstrated
throughout the past 8 months. I am proud to have been associated with John, and I join with the rest of the
wing in expressing our deepest condolences at his loss. Be assured that I stand ready to help you in any
way I can during this time of sorrow.
                                                      Sincerely

Dear Mrs. Doe
       I wanted you to know how much we regret the loss of your son, Airman First Class John J. Doe.
The entire squadron joins me in sending our deepest sympathies and understanding during this period of
bereavement.
        John was one of the finest airmen in the 100th Mission Support Squadron. I am personally aware
of the numerous accomplishments John made while assigned here. Additionally, John was very active in
the community, particularly with the church and physical fitness activities. His personality was one of
promoting teamwork and positive motivation--I never saw John without a smile!
       John was definitely a topnotch performer. He was selected Airman of the Quarter for the period 1
October through 31 December 2004, at both the squadron and group level. This was a remarkable
achievement!
       Please know we share in your pain and sorrow and offer final respects to one of our very best—
John will certainly be missed by all of us.
