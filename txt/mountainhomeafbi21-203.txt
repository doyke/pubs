SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changed paragraph 1.2. to read, “Transportation: As specified in AFMAN 91-201, chapter 8.”
Added “Locks assigned NSN 5340-00-158-3805, NSN 5340-00-158-3807, NSN 5340-01-408-
8434 or NSN 5340-01-269-9345, all meet the prescribed CID” to paragraph 6.2.2.. Changed the
last two sentences of paragraph 6.2.2. to read, “If the truck is left unattended on the flightline,
use the above procedures to secure explosives. Do not leave explosives unattended in vehicles
off the flightline/in unsecured areas.” Added paragraph 6.2.3. Chock all vehicles when driver’s
seat is left unoccupied and impulse cartridges are being transported.
1. Explosive Limits:
     1.1. Storage. Limited to the minimum quantities needed to support requirements IAW
     AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.
     1.2. Transportation. As specified in AFMAN 91-201, chapter 8.
2. Personnel Limits. Transportation is limited to the minimum number of personnel required
for explosive operation(s) in progress.
3. Safety Precautions. Comply with AFMAN 91-201.
4. Location of Operation:
     4.1. Storage. In each aircraft maintenance unit (AMU), as designated by the AF Form 2047,
     Explosives Facility License, the unit weapons safety representative will coordinate with the
     366th Fighter Wing, Weapons Safety (366 FW/SEW), 366th Civil Engineer Squadron, Fire
     Department (366 CES/CEF), 366th Security Forces Squadron, Resource Protection (366
     SFS/S5L), and the 366th Equipment Maintenance Squadron, Munitions Accountable
     Systems Officer (MASO) (366 EMS/MXMW), any time the explosive storage locker is
     relocated.
     4.2. Transportation. Transportation is limited to and from storage location, explosive
     loading operations, and the munitions storage area. Utilize designated explosive routes
     whenever possible.
5. Emergency Procedures. When an immediate dangerous explosive situation exists with
impulse cartridges, shut down all operations in the immediate vicinity and evacuate nonessential
personnel within a circumference of at least 300 feet. Call 366 MOS/MXOOM (Maintenance
Operations Center (MOC)) at 828-5900, describe the specific hazard and ensure the Emergency
Communications Center is contacted.
6. Equipment Require ments:
     6.1. Storage:
        6.1.1. Keep impulse cartridges in grounded metal cabinets that provide adequate security
        and protection from the elements. The lock used to secure the storage container will meet
        or exceed requirements identified in AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense.
MOUNTAINHOMEAFBI21-203 10 MARCH 2011                                                           3


      6.1.2. Storage containers will have an approved grounding system with an accessible
      grounding bar. The additional duty weapons safety noncommissioned officer (NCO) will
      document a visual check of the grounding system every quarter, accomplish and
      document a 24- month continuity check from locker-to-ground and keep these test and
      inspection records for a minimum of six inspection cycles IAW AFI 32-1065, Grounding
      Systems. If there is a suspected break in continuity, re-accomplish a 24- month continuity
      check.
      6.1.3. Store impulse cartridges removed from hermetically sealed containers (protected)
      in a waterproof or water-repellent container at all times prior to loading (in breeches).
      Cartridge propellants are susceptible to moisture absorption with consequent
      deterioration of performance. Place impulse cartridges, not in original shipping
      containers, in wooden or other locally manufactured cutouts to prevent item-to- item
      contact. Paint impulse cartridge cans red with easily identifiable markings in white to
      identify contents.
      6.1.4. Fire extinguishers and fire symbols are required IAW AFMAN 91-201 and the AF
      Form 2047 remarks section.
   6.2. Transportation:
      6.2.1. Transportation requirements identified in AFMAN 91-201, Section 8G-
      Transportation and Movement by Motor Vehicle and Material Handling Equipment.
      Metro type vehicles may be used. Do not use pick-up trucks with plastic bed liners
      unless the metal container is electrically bonded to the vehicle.
      6.2.2. Place impulse cartridges in storage containers IAW AFMAN 91-201 under
      "Transporting Electro- Explosive Devices." Immobilize storage containers in the vehicle
      to prevent movement or unauthorized removal. Storage container lock will meet or
      exceed requirements identified in Department of Defense Manual (DODM) 5100-76,
      Physical Security of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives. Locks
      assigned NSN 5340-00-158-3805, NSN 5340-00-158-3807, NSN 5340-01-408-8434 or
      NSN 5340-01-269-9345, all meet the prescribed CID. For vehicles used temporarily,
      carry two fire extinguishers with a minimum rating each of 2A:10BC with the vehicle
      and block, brace, or otherwise immobilize the explosive storage container to prevent
      movement. If the truck is left unattended on the flightline, use the above procedures to
      secure explosives. Do not leave explosives unattended in vehicles off the flightline/in
      unsecured areas.
      6.2.3. Chock all vehicles when driver’s seat is left unoccupied and impulse cartridges are
      being transported.
7. Ope rating Procedures:
   7.1. Weapons section Noncommissioned Officers In Charge (NCOIC) manage storage of
   impulse cartridges.
   7.2. Keep cartridge control log with the locker. The appropriate weapons supervisor
   performs inventory and signs off the control log before and at the end of each shift.

     7.3. Weapons section NCOICs will limit access to cartridge locker. Post a list of personnel
     authorized access to cartridge locker with a copy of this publication available on the outside
     of the locker.
     7.4. Keep serviceable and unserviceable cartridges separated during storage and
     transportation. Clearly mark the shelf or area designated for unserviceable cartridges inside
     the storage container "Unserviceable" and separate from serviceable cartridges. Utilize
     opened shipping containers to store serviceable and unserviceable cartridges in their
     designated areas. Return unserviceable cartridges to 366 EMS/MXMWMB (Munitions
     Inspection Section), with an AF Form 2005, Issue/Turn- in Request, or through Electronic
     Documentation (EDOC).
     7.5. Using AFTO Form 350, Repairable Item Processing Tag, tag impulse cartridges
     involved in malfunctions with the aircraft tail number, station and date. Turn these cartridges
     into 366 EMS/MXMWMB for disposition pending completion of investigation.
     7.6. Keep cartridges for transient aircraft separate in the cartridge locker and identified by
     unit and mission design series. Coordinate long-term storage and impulse cartridges not
     licensed for cart locker with 366 EMS/MXMWMB for storage.
     7.7. Munitions account custodians will ensure enough serviceable cartridges are on hand to
     meet mission requirements. Additional cartridges may be temporarily authorized to be stored
     during generations/deployments, additional limits and instructions are annotated in the
     remarks section of the AF Form 2047.
     7.8. Initiate an AF Form 2005 or EDOC for aircraft departing or returning from depot
     maintenance or transfer.
     7.9. Impulse cartridges pre- use inspections will adhere to Technical Order (T.O.) 11A18-7-
     7, Storage and Maintenance Procedures for Aircraft External Stores Jettison Impulse
     Cartridges, and individually marked IAW T.O. 1F-XX(X)-33-1-2, Nonnuclear Munitions
     Basic Information and Nonnuclear Munitions Loading Procedures.
     7.10. Preferred method of turning in FOB/unserviceable impulse cartridges is in the original
     shipping containers; therefore storage of empty containers inside the cart locker is
     authorized. Store empty containers in a separate area of the cart locker, unless utilized as
     identified in paragraph 7.4.
8. Prescribed and Adopted Forms:
     8.1. Prescribed Forms:
          No forms prescribed.
