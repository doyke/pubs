     and compromise their dental health. Unit commanders are notified of those patients missing
     their dental appointments.
        4.3.1. If a patient is not present for their appointment at the appointed time to maximize
        available treatment time, it may be filled with a patient waiting for stand-by care. If a
        patient is more than 10 minutes late for their appointment, they are considered a no-show
        and a broken appointment letter may be sent to their commander.
     4.4. Parent or Legal Guardian. A parent or legal guardian must accompany children under
     the age of 17 years old that are receiving dental treatment.
5. Worldwide Qualification.
     5.1. The AFDRAP seeks to keep all military personnel in optimal oral health in order to
     maintain worldwide duty qualification. Optimal oral health is defined as dental health class 1
     or 2. Unit commanders should cooperate with dental services to ensure personnel are

     clearance can be obtained by calling the dental clinic for an appointment at 225-8864 option
