                                            Chapter 1

                                   POLICY AND CONCEPTS

1.1. Introduction
     1.1.1. This AFI provides guidance for geographic, functional, and ARC aligned AOC
     training programs. Guidance for geographic AOCs is applicable to Rapid Augmentation
     Team (RAT) as established by AF Program Action Directive (PAD) 10-2, Direction to
     Restructure Command and Control of Component Numbered Air Forces.
        1.1.1.1. Chapter 1 lists general training guidance applicable to all AOCs. Specific AOC
        and ARC aligned AOC units training program requirements are explained in Chapter 2.
        Due to the nature of their organizational structure and differing processes, functional
        AOC training program requirements will be addressed in functional MAJCOM/unit
        supplements.
        1.1.1.2. ARC unit CCs will ensure their annual training plans include training to
        maintain worldwide deploy ability.
     1.1.2. This AFI outlines AOC training concept, structure and responsibilities.
     1.1.3. This AFI applies to AOC crewmembers to include specialty teams and also establishes
     required orientation training for liaison/augmentation personnel.
        1.1.3.1. AOC crewmembers, to include specialty teams, fill operational mission essential
        positions in the AOC. These positions are listed in AFI 13-1AOCV3, AOC Organization
        and Operational Procedures. AOC crewmembers may be military, civilian, or contractor
        personnel and are permanently assigned to active duty or ARC AOC units. Additionally,
        due to AOC manning constraints and unique theater or functional requirements, AOC
        units may require locally developed crewmember positions supporting a combatant
        commander that are not identified in AFI 13-1AOCV3. Unique positions and training
        associated with these positions will be identified in a unit supplement to this AFI.
        1.1.3.2. Liaison/augmentation personnel may represent other weapon systems,
        components, commands, government agencies, or coalition partners.              They are
        administratively subordinate to their parent organizations while working within the AOC
        and will receive orientation training from the host AOC. Orientation training specifics
        are outlined in paragraph 2.3 of this AFI.
        1.1.3.3. Augmentees on temporary assignment to a host AOC Commander (AOC/CC)
        must receive locally developed orientation training by the host AOC.
     1.1.4. This AFI directs formal appointment of AOC trainers with a unit developed trainer
     training program. Guidance on AOC trainer training can be found in paragraph 2.4 of this
     AFI.
Note: AOC crewmember training, as outlined in this AFI, is a separate program from Air Force
On-the-Job Training (OJT). OJT is governed by AFI 36-2201 Vol 3, Air Force Training
Program On-the-Job Training Administration, and documented on the AF Form 623, On-the-Job
Training Record or other AF approved system (for enlisted members only). There is a potential
AFI13-1AOCV1 7 December 2011                                                                   5


overlap of training requirements and events. Even so, AOC training and career field training
documentation are separate programs.
1.2. General
   1.2.1. AOC training: There are two overarching categories of AOC training, crewmember
   and orientation training. AOC crewmember training consists of Initial Qualification Training
   (IQT) and Mission Qualification Training (MQT) for all AOC crewmembers qualifying to
   Combat Mission Ready (CMR). Upon receipt of CMR designation, all AOC CMR
   crewmembers will then complete Continuation Training (CT) requirements IAW paragraph
   2.2.3. Additionally, each unit will conduct orientation training as outlined in paragraph 2.3
   of this AFI for augmentees and liaison personnel.
   1.2.2. All training will be documented (See paragraph 2.5 of this AFI). Units will document
   IQT and MQT in the AOC learning management system (LMS) utilizing electronic AF Form
   4141, Individuals’ Record of Duties and Experience, Ground Environment Personnel.
   Functional communities such as Intelligence, Cyber, and Information Operations, may use
   command directed LMS systems to track IQT, MQT, and CT as long as the system provides
   equivalent information and is accessible to AOC training management personnel.
   Continuation training (CT) will be documented on locally developed tracking systems, other
   (Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) compliant) electronic storage means,
   or LMS AF Form 4142, Individual Annual Training Record, when developed. Units may
   maintain manual training folders as backups only. Units will maintain IQT/MQT training
   documentation on personnel until PCS and forward to next unit if at an AOC. Following
   award of CMR status, IQT/MQT training documentation and certificates may be maintained
   in unit developed grade books, or maintained in unit developed training folders. Award of
   CMR will be documented IAW AFI 13-1AOC, Volume 2, AOC Standards and Evaluation.
   Additionally, this CMR will be annotated by training personnel on AF Form 4141.
   1.2.3. All AOCs and affiliated units will have an annual training plan (ATP). An example
   can be found on the AOC community of practice (CoP) page (see attachment 2, Glossary of
   Links for the CoP address).
   1.2.4. Any reference to "days" means calendar days. The training year coincides with the
   fiscal year (FY).
   1.2.5. Any reference to Formal Training Unit (FTU), unless stated otherwise, is intended to
   mean the FTU at Hurlburt Field, FL, operated by the 505th Command and Control Wing
   (CCW).
1.3. Responsibilities
   1.3.1. HQ USAF/A3O-AC: Provides oversight of this AFI and maintains air staff advocacy

                                           Chapter 2

                                AOC TRAINING PROGRAM

2.1. Introduction: This chapter provides AOC training requirements with program details for
Geographic AOCs and their ARC aligned units. Functional AOCs will abide by this chapter
unless otherwise identified in their Unit/MAJCOM supplement, which will take precedence, and
no waiver is required.
   2.1.1. Crewmember training is a sequential, three-phased program to reach and maintain
   CMR status. Phases are: IQT, MQT, and CT.
   2.1.2. Orientation training contains portions of the sequential three-phased crewmember
   training program tailored to the crewmember’s individual experience. Orientation training
   may result in awarding of CMR Status and awarding of a SEI upon training completion.
2.2. Crewmember Training Program
   2.2.1. Initial Qualification Training (IQT):
       2.2.1.1. IQT provides the training necessary to qualify AOC crew-members in a generic
       division/team level position without regard to a specific AOC’s mission. Upon
       completion of IQT, crewmembers attain BQ status and are awarded the appropriate AOC
       SEI. BQ is the qualification status of an AOC crew member who has satisfactorily
       completed IQT and is qualified to perform AOC divisional/team duties. The member
       must meet the minimum academic and performance standards set forth by the AOC
       weapons system FTU. BQ is not a long-term status nor does it imply position specific
       expertise; individuals are required to continue training progressing to MQT to improve
       and attain proficiency on positional duties and tasks related to their unit’s mission.
          2.2.1.1.1. AOCs must request a waiver from their MAJCOM OPR for each
          individual unable to attend FTU. Personnel waived from FTU attendance must
          complete In-Unit IQT (IUIQT). IUIQT will be accomplished using the FTU course
          syllabus and materials to the maximum extent possible within unit resources.
          2.2.1.1.2. Not all AOC duty positions are accommodated by FTU in-residence
          courses (List located on AOC CoP - See Attachment 2). For those that are standard
          but not taught at the FTU, ACC/A3C or MAJCOM OPR is responsible for
          development of a MAJCOM approved IQT program. For those non-AFI 13-1AOC,
          volume 3 crew positions unique to their AOC/CCDR, IQT development is a unit
          responsibility. For AMD positions not accommodated by the FTU a list is posted on
          the AMD Training CoP, see Attachment 2.
          2.2.1.1.3. Attending IQT enroute to the AOC permanent change of station (PCS)
          location is the preferred method IAW this AFI. AOC TMs must ensure this occurs to
          the maximum extent possible. If IQT enroute to PCS is not an option, contact the
          gaining unit MAJCOM POC who will then coordinate with ACC/A3CT.
       2.2.1.2. Purpose: IQT provides foundational knowledge, skills, and context for follow-on
       training. IQT provides basic skills to all AOC crewmembers in order for them to work in
AFI13-1AOCV1 7 December 2011                                                                13


     an AOC, but does not provide theater specifics. Crewmember theater duty requirements
     will be acquired through unit MQT program.
     2.2.1.3. Method: IQT will consist of students taking the advanced distributed learning
     (ADL) lessons in LMS and an FTU course. AOC crewmembers will attend the FTU in-
     residence unless otherwise noted on AOC CoP or approved MAJCOM supplement for
     functional AOCs. Members learning a secondary AOC duty position will be allowed to
     return to the FTU with MAJCOM OPR and ACC/A3CT coordination and approval.
        2.2.1.3.1. There are only four courses currently approved as ―in-lieu–of‖ courses for
        prescribed FTU courses: The USAF Weapons School Space Superiority course at
        Nellis AFB, NV for AOC space personnel; the Advanced Study of Air Mobility
        (ASAM) course at the USAF Air Expeditionary Center at McGuire AFB, NJ; the
        SAASS at Maxwell AFB, AL for Strategy Division personnel; and the C/JSSC
        Course at Hurlburt Field, FL, for Division Chiefs. These courses include AOC and
        AOC process training which are applicable to the positions these crewmembers
        normally work. These and any new ―in–lieu-of‖ courses may be found on the AOC
        CoP.
        2.2.1.3.2. AOC crewmember positions are mapped to FTU and ―in-lieu–of‖ courses
        on the AOC CoP.
     2.2.1.4. Timeline: Crewmembers attending FTU will complete IQT upon graduation.
     IUIQT will be completed within 120 days from start date for active duty personnel and
     18 months for ARC personnel. IUIQT must be started no later than 30 days (180 days for
     ARC personnel) following date arrived station (DAS). If necessary for mission
     accomplishment, IUIQT may be completed prior to FTU attendance, but IQT SEI should
     not be awarded until crewmember attends FTU.
     2.2.1.5. Exceptions: Exceptions to the IQT timeline may occur via extension or
     incomplete result in training. Note: IQT is a onetime event and an individual returning to
     an AOC assignment after having previously accomplished IQT need not re-accomplish
     this phase. They must still complete appropriate training outlined by unit training
     manager following records review. This is not a waiver and the original IQT completion
     date remains in effect. Qualification in a new AOC position may require a different IQT
     or FTU class, in which case IQT may be reaccomplished for the new position.
     Attendance in new FTU class will require AOC TM request, MAJCOM POC and
     ACC/A3CT approval.
        2.2.1.5.1. Extension: AOC/CCs may grant a single 30-day extension (ARC aligned
        unit commanders may grant 180 days) for completion of IQT. Following the
        AOC/CC extension, the CC, upon review of the individual’s training to date, may
        request an additional extension from MAJCOM OPR of 30 days. If after the
        AOC/CC and/or MAJCOM OPR extensions, training is still not complete, the
        commander has two options: either reenter the individual into training (restart the
        clock) or drop the individual from AOC training permanently. Both options are
        mandatory reporting items to the MAJCOM OPR and ACC/A3CT.
 14                                                       AFI13-1AOCV1 7 December 2011


          2.2.1.5.2. Incomplete: Students unable to finish an FTU course for other than
          performance issues (e.g., medical reasons, etc.) may be reentered into a subsequent
          class with 505 TRS/CC recommendation, unit CC, and ACC/A3CT concurrence.
          2.2.1.5.3. Failure: FTU IQT failure is a mandatory reporting item by the 505 TRS to
          the reporting unit, the MAJCOM OPR, and ACC/A3CT. The following gaining unit
          commander options are available for IQT failure:
              2.2.1.5.3.1. Due to extenuating circumstances, return individual to the FTU with
              505 TRS/CC recommendations; gaining unit CC, MAJCOM OPR, and
              ACC/A3CT approval.
              2.2.1.5.3.2. End training and place individual in a unit non AOC crewmember
              position.
Note: A student who failed an FTU IQT course may not be subsequently enrolled in IUIQT.
   2.2.2. Mission Qualification Training (MQT)
       2.2.2.1. Definition: MQT provides the training necessary to qualify or requalify AOC
       crewmembers in a specific position to perform the missions assigned to a specific AOC.
       MQT is a unit responsibility. AOC crewmembers maintain BQ status until they complete
       MQT. Completion of MQT is a prerequisite for attaining CMR status.
       2.2.2.2. Purpose: The purpose of MQT is to prepare a crewmember for attainment of
       CMR status in a specific AOC duty position.
       2.2.2.3. Method: MQT normally involves tailored training with a trainer plus applicable
       subject matter experts (SMEs), classroom academics, self-study, and practice as
       necessary. Each AOC will determine the best mix of methods to meet all MQT training
       needs. ACC/A3C and parent MAJCOMs will manage the development and use of MQT
       course materials and TTLs. TTLs for AFI 13-1AOCV3 crewmember positions must be
       approved and standardized by HQ ACC/A3C in coordination with appropriate theater or
       functional MAJCOM. WS standardized MQT Training 797s; program of instruction,
       etc., along with execution guidance will be posted to the AOC CoP and considered an
       extension of this AFI as minimum guidance.
       2.2.2.4. Timeline: MQT must be started NLT 45 days from IQT completion (90 days for
       ARC personnel). First term airmen will complete the first term airmen course then have
       30 days for entry into MQT. In all cases, MQT must be complete within 90 days of start
       (ARC personnel have 365 days to complete) of MQT.
       2.2.2.5. MQT is complete when all training requirements are complete and the individual
       is released to unit Stan/Eval. A crewmember will achieve CMR status when Stan/Eval
       has completed its evaluation process and the AOC/CC or designate (not lower than AOC
       Division Chief level) signs the appropriate paperwork.
       2.2.2.6. Portions may be accomplished before formal entry into MQT; however, MQT
       may not be completed out of sequence (i.e., prior to IQT complete).
       2.2.2.7. MQT may not be waived.
       2.2.2.8. Extensions: Extensions to the MQT timeline may occur as follows: The
       Commander may approve one 30-day extension (180 days for ARC units). Following a
AFI13-1AOCV1 7 December 2011                                                              15


       unit CC extension, the MAJCOM OPR may grant an additional 30 day (ARC 180 days)
       extension.
       2.2.2.9. Incomplete/failure to progress: If training is not complete after Unit/CC and
       MAJCOM OPR extensions, the CC must remove the individual from training and assign
       to a non-AOC crewmember position.
       2.2.2.10. Upon CMR certification it is incumbent on the AOC TM to ensure appropriate
       SEI code has been changed from the generic non-CMR SEI to the applicable AOC CMR
       SEI.
   2.2.3. Continuation Training (CT)
       2.2.3.1. Definition: CT provides crewmembers with the volume, frequency, and mix of
       training necessary to maintain CMR proficiency in their assigned position. CT begins
       after a crewmember has attained CMR status. Units are responsible for developing an
       annual CT plan focusing on the units’ mission or support for any upcoming major
       exercises. These plans will be approved by AOC/CC and submitted to appropriate
       MAJCOM for review and additional guidance.
Note: Mandatory AF training generally referred to as ancillary training may not be counted
toward CT. ARC units will accomplish standardized academic CT (IAW Attachment 3) over a
two-year vice one-year period. Thus, quarterly requirements become semi-annual; semi-annual
become annual requirements, and annual requirements become bi-annual for ARC aligned units.

Note: The above table is not all inclusive but does contain most exercises AOC units participate
in. Any question on exercise classification should be directed to MAJCOM OPR or ACC/A3CT.
        2.2.3.2. Content: AOCs have common CT requirements levied by MAJCOM OPR;
        however, each is expected to add unique CT requirements to their ATP. General CT
        requirement table is at Attachment 3. AOCs have general CT requirements in the
        following six primary and one AOC/CC categories.

              2.2.3.2.2. Joint force and AOC authoritative documents
              2.2.3.2.3. AOC systems

              2.2.3.2.5. Process/positional training
              2.2.3.2.6. Exercise participation
              2.2.3.2.7. Unit CC/Division Chief assigned requirements
        2.2.3.3. Purpose: CT accomplishes two purposes: maintaining AOC positional
        qualification (CMR status) and expanding operational level knowledge and C2 skills. CT
        is the AOC/CC’s and Division Chiefs’ tool to ensure that AOC crewmembers are
        prepared to support CCDR, JFACC, and AADC as required at all times. Crewmembers
        qualified in more than one position must meet CT requirements for each position. Dual
        qualified crewmembers with like CT requirements that are the same for each position
        only need to perform the specific CT requirement for 1 position.
        2.2.3.4. Method: CT may consist of any combination of mass academics, e-learning,
        directed self-study, systems training, positional refresher training, or exercises.
        2.2.3.5. Timeline: CT requirements begin the first duty day of the following month after
        the individual is designated CMR. Requirement completion timeframes can be found in
        Attachment 3 and unit ATPs. CT requirements specific to functional AOCs will be
        addressed in their Unit/MAJCOM supplement. CT may be prorated but is normally not
        waived. Waivers will be evaluated on a case by case basis and approved by MAJCOM
        OPR. ARC units will accomplish CT training over a two-year vice one-year period.
        2.2.3.6. Proration: Units may prorate CT requirements based on initial CMR date,
        TDYs, deployments, or periods of non-AOC duty (e.g., honor guard, medical leave).
        Unit must ensure training is adjusted to account for time assigned (PCS or TDY) to
        contingencies (See Figure 2.1.)
Figure 2.1. Continuation Training Proration Schedule. ARC will use three month = one
month for proration.
CT Periods         CT requirement is prorated if crewmember is unavailable for training (reasons stated above) for
                   more than (or equal to) the following number of days*:
Monthly (M)         Oct    Nov      Dec     Jan     Feb     Mar     Apr      May      Jun        Jul   Aug       Sep

Note: CT periods are tied to calendar. Crewmember non-availability days need not be contiguous to prorate from
CT.
Examples:
(1) Capt Smith becomes CMR on Apr 20.
- Monthly CT for Oct thru Apr are waived;
- Quarterly CT for 1st, and 2nd quarters are waived,
- Semi-Annual CT for the 1st half is waived; For ARC 18 month training is waived.
(2) A1C Jones becomes CMR on Sep 21.
- Monthly CT would start on 1 Oct the beginning of the CT period for all.
- Annual CT is waived and New Year begins 1 Oct.
         2.2.3.7. Failure to meet CT requirements: Failure to meet CT requirements results in
         regression to non-CMR (N-CMR) status. AOC/CCs may allow up to a 30-day grace
         period for the accomplishment of CT requirements. ARC-aligned unit commanders may
         allow up to a 180-day grace period.
             2.2.3.7.1. N-CMR crewmembers may not perform AOC duties unless supervised by
             a CMR crewmember.
             2.2.3.7.2. To regain CMR status, a crewmember must accomplish the delinquent CT.
             The individual's training records must reflect both the regression to N-CMR and the
             reacquisition of CMR status.
             2.2.3.7.3. Failure to regain CMR within 6 months (18 months for ARC) results in
             regression to unqualified status (UQ).
2.3. Orientation Training
     2.3.1. All AOCs must provide orientation training for TDY AOC crewmembers, specialty
     team members, liaisons, and augmentees to aid their integration. This training will be
     tailored and based on expected duties, previous experience, and AOC knowledge. The
     gaining AOC is responsible to both develop content and present the training.
Note: A CMR rating in any AFI 13-1AOCV3 position is transferrable among the Geographic
AOCs in the same CMR duty position upon completion of unit theater familiarization training.
     2.3.2. Orientation training is a menu of training modules consisting of any combination of e-
     learning lessons, briefings, or directed self-study. This menu is designed by the AOC TM,
     tailored to the individual, and approved by AOC/CC or Division Chief if delegated by CC.
         2.3.2.1. Orientation training is appropriate for CMR AOC crewmembers temporarily
         assigned to another AOC. If the AOC crewmember performs duties in his or her CMR
         position, theater/mission familiarization should be all that is required.
         2.3.2.2. Augmentees from various mission design series (MDS) or other government
         agencies (OGA) may need AOC orientation and other training.
     2.3.2.3. Each AOC will present an orientation training program from which individual items
     are chosen as appropriate and may include the following subject areas:
 18                                                           AFI13-1AOCV1 7 December 2011


           2.3.2.3.1. AOC fundamentals
           2.3.2.3.2. Unit mission or theater orientation
           2.3.2.3.3. Chain of command
           2.3.2.3.4. Applicable planning and execution documents
           2.3.2.3.5. Augmentee positional responsibilities
   2.3.3. This training is in addition to mandatory AF training (e.g., information assurance [IA]
   training).
2.4. Trainer Program
   2.4.1. The AOC weapons system is not similar to other weapons systems in that active duty
   personnel are normally assigned for only one tour. Therefore, the AOC WS does not have a
   formal program to develop and certify trainers for a career. AOC personnel selected to
   perform as trainers are considered by AOC leadership as highly proficient in division and
   team processes or a particular AOC WS application. They will complete local AOC trainer
   program requirements below and are not required to complete any formal USAF
   trainer/instructor program in order to be considered an AOC trainer.
   2.4.2. AOC crew position trainers must be approved by the AOC or ARC aligned unit
   commander or commander designated division/team chiefs, and must be CMR in their
   current AOC crew position.
Note: AOCs may elect to use a SME for certain elements of their training programs (e.g.,
theater/mission familiarization training, systems and applications, or designated processes).
SMEs will not fill the role of duty position trainer but rather augment training given by the
designated trainer.
   2.4.3. AOC crew position trainers will receive the following training from the unit TM:
       2.4.3.1. Unit training administrative practices to include filling out unit training
       documentation
       2.4.3.2. Trainer responsibilities
       2.4.3.3. Positional training techniques
       2.4.3.4. Briefing/Debriefing techniques
2.5. Training Documentation
   2.5.1. AOC crewmember documentation: Units must maintain a permanent training record
   in LMS which contains the following milestones: DAS, training start dates, IQT and MQT
   training dates, IQT graduation/completion date, MQT training completion date, CMR award
   date, N-CMR events, deployment dates and associated orientation training, and any other
   significant training dates. ARC aligned units will maintain their own records in LMS.
   2.5.2. Orientation documentation: The content of the orientation training provided must be
   documented.
   2.5.3. Annual Training Plan (ATP): All AOCs, and ARC aligned units, will develop an
   annual training plan which should include the following elements:
AFI13-1AOCV1 7 December 2011                                                               19


     2.5.3.1. AOC crewmember positions (those AFI 13-1AOC Vol 3 positions either manned
     or expected to be filled with a requirement to train).
     2.5.3.2. Unique AOC positions mapped against IQT options (FTU, ADL, or IUIQT).
     2.5.3.3. Additional CT training requirements (in addition to Attachment 3).

Terms
Ancillary Training—Training that contributes to mission accomplishment, but is separate from
Air Force Specialty or occupational series training (further defined on the ETCA website,
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/default1.asp).   Ancillary training does not constitute AOC
training.
AOC Type—Refers to AOC categorization as either Geographic or Functional (see Geographic
and Functional AOC definitions). AOC training instructions applicable to all AOC types are
located in Chapter 1. AOC training instructions specific to Geographic AOCs are located in
AFI13-1AOCV1 7 December 2011                                                                 25


Chapter 2. AOC training instructions for the Functional AOCs are located in subsequent
chapters as outlined in the Table of Contents. While Chapter 1 is applicable to all AOCs,
subsequent chapters may be more restrictive but not less than Chapter 1. Note: the term "CAF"
AOCs refers to Geographic AOCs plus the 608th.
Augmentee—Personnel filling AOC positions on a temporary, short-term basis (i.e. TDY to
exercises or contingencies). Augmentees require tailored orientation training, and may require
positional training. Augmentee AOC training is the responsibility of the gaining AOC.
Basic Qualification (BQ)— An AOC crewmember who has completed IQT but not completed
MQT. They are able to perform basic AOC positional activities for which they have been
trained.
Certification—Designation of an AOC crewmember-trainee by the AOC/CC, as having
successfully completed MQT (including positional review, debrief, and any directed additional
training), and requisite mission qualification examination (MQE). Certification may result in
CMR status. Certification also applies to AOC crewmember upgrade to trainer.
Combat Mission Ready (CMR)— The qualification status of an AOC crewmember who
successfully completes IQT and MQT training requirements, passes initial and mission
qualification testing (if applicable) and has been certified by the commander or designated
representative.
Currency— AFI does not mandate currency with respect to accomplishment of CT
requirements. There is no measure of time between required CT events (e.g. Push an ATO
every 45 days). Thus, if AOCs elect to impose currency requirements, they should be designed
to ensure the average crewmember maintains a minimum level of proficiency in a given duty or
task. Currency differs from CT periods and requirements per this AFI, in that currency refers to
periods of time linked directly to events (such as a pilot having to perform a landing within 30
days of his last accomplished landing). CT periods refer to timeframes during which a set
number of events must be accomplished.
Functional AOC— One of the two AOC Types, along with Geographic. Functional AOCs
have function-specific missions which are worldwide in scope, in support of a Functional
Combatant Command. They include 608th (Global Strike), 614th (Space), 618th (Mobility),
and 623rd (Special Ops).
Geographic AOC— One of the two AOC Types, along with Functional. Geographic AOCs
have broad-ranging missions which are constrained in scope to a geographic Area of
Responsibility, in support of a Geographic Unified (or Sub-unified) Combatant Command.
They include 601st, 603rd, 607th, 609th, 611th, 612th, 613th and 617th.
Liaison Officer (LNO)—Allied nation, sister service, other government agencies, or unique
major weapons system/mission representative working for their own respective commander but
providing planning/tasking expertise and coordination capability in support of the AOC. AOCs
will provide and document orientation training to LNOs to facilitate integration.
Non-Combat Mission Ready (N-CMR)— The qualification status of an individual who, having
achieved CMR status, regresses due to failure to accomplish mandatory CT requirements. See
respective AOC type chapter for consequence and repair of N-CMR status. See definition of
Unqualified for distinction from N-CMR.
 26                                                         AFI13-1AOCV1 7 December 2011


Requalification Training—Tailored training for formerly-CMR AOC crewmembers that have
become unqualified for any reason. Objective is return to CMR status. Completion will be
followed by positional re-evaluation and accomplishment of recurring qualification examination
(RQE). AOC TMs will coordinate with applicable division/team training personnel and if
necessary, Stan/Eval, to identify performance deficiencies and create appropriate requalification
training plans. Requalification training plans require AOC/CC approval.
Trainer—CMR AOC crewmember, authorized via AOC trainer upgrade program and AOC/CC
certification, to conduct AOC crewmember training. Trainers may also be contractors who were
previously qualified and hired for subject matter expertise. Further guidance in 2.4 of this AFI.
Training Task List (TTL)—Documentation of total training tasks developed for a prime
mission system and its respective mission. It includes the entire spectrum of tasks in each
functional area requiring training. The TTL provides the training task baseline for all
acquisition, modification, support, management, and funding actions through comparison with
predecessor or future prime mission systems (AFI 36-2251, Management of Air Force Training
Systems). MAJCOMs with their respective AOCs develop AOC TTLs. AOC Training TTLs
will be approved by HQ USAF/A3O. All CAF MQT TTLs for AFI 13-1AOCV3 listed duty
positions must be standardized through ACC/A3C. TTLs will be posted to the AOC CoP.
Type 1 Training—Contract training by civilian industrial institutions, supporting initial cadres
of trainers and operators the Air Force requires for new or modified AOC systems (often referred
to as "train the trainer").    The AOC TM will coordinate this training with AFMC/ESC,
specifically the SPO (ESC/HSGB).           Type 1 Training should be documented as such in
accordance with pertinent AOC Type chapter of this AFI.
Unqualified (UQ)—Previously CMR AOC crewmembers whose CMR status has lapsed due to
any of the following reasons: N-CMR in excess of six mos, PCS/PCA out of AOC crewmember
assignment, or AOC/CC-directed. See Requalification Training. Note, AOC crewmember-
trainees in IQT are not "unqualified," they are "not qualified.‖ In addition, those in MQT status
are not UQ rather BQ.
