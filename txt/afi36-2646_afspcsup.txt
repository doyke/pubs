4.2.6.3. (Added) IAW AFMAN 31-201, Volume 1, Security Forces History at least once each
duty cycle, Supervisors will conduct and inform Flight Trainers on what flight exercises were
accomplished as part of flight training program. A blotter entry shall document the time,
location, and details of flight level exercises. (T-2).
4.2.6.4. (Added) Flight Trainers are critical to the success of the unit-training program. They
must be competent individuals with impressive skills who excel in training and are proficient in
applying training fundamentals while understanding the importance of collective flight
proficiency in required tasks.
4.3.2.1. (Added) The collective tasks of a unit are the essence of the unit's mission
requirements. Collective tasks are derived from specific unit missions and require rigorous
group participation for their accomplishment. Each Defender is trained to perform a job. The
unit must also train to do its mission. Table A6.1 provides concepts and resources available to
assist the commander to weave specific collective training tasks/applications into the defender’s
individual and team training requirements.
4.3.4.1. (Added) Units will plan and conduct at least one unit-level collective training event
per CY quarter. To provide a building block approach for achieving training objectives, use Hot-
Wash critiques and after action reports (AARs) to document lessons learned (L2). Additionally,
report the number of events completed and of each type of exercise performed (i.e. gate runner,
hostage situation, etc.) to the A7SOT NLT 10 duty days after close of each quarter. HQ
AFSPC/A7SOT will review inputs and share trends with all units. (T-2).
4.3.10.6.1. (Added) If a trainee requires a second extension, S-3 Operations may grant a 30
calendar day extension. First, the trainee’s supervisor will develop a request to be approved by
flight leadership. Next, flight leadership will send the request to S-3/Training for review. The S-
3 Operations Superintendent or Operations Officer will approve the request, as appropriate.
Finally, the circumstances, dates and reasons for the delay will be loaded into the individual's
AFTR. Any further extensions must be approved by the DFC and again documented in the
individual's AFTR. (T-3).
4.3.11.1. (Added) S-3/Training will notify the Standardization Evaluation section in writing or
via email within three (3) duty days after duty position qualification training is complete. (T-3).
4.3.12.6. (Added) Live fire proficiency/sustainment (IAW AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms
Program, para 5.18) training for assigned personnel on all weapons they are authorized and
qualified to carry. (T-1).
4.3.17.2.1.1. (Added) The justification for training deviations will be sent to the AFSPC
Security Forces Division (HQ AFSPC/A7SO) 90 days prior to the anticipated training due date.
This will allow HQ AFSPC/A7SOT the opportunity to assist the unit in meeting training goals.
(T-2).
5.4.2.1.1. (Added) Electronic dates and signatures are authorized when the document is
digitally signed using a Common Access Card.
5.4.3.3.1.1. (Added) Ensure clearing procedures include training as Clearing Barrel Official
and mishap actions/reporting.
AFI36-2646_AFSPCSUP 2 OCTOBER 2014                                                                5


5.4.3.5. A written job knowledge evaluation will be incorporated into DPEs (Exception: 61 SFS
DAF positions will be exempt of this requirement based upon previous agreements with IBPO
prior to the release of this supplement). (T-2).
5.4.3.5.1.1. (Added) The evaluation should consist of a minimum of 25 questions, but no more
than 50 questions. Tests will consist of a combination of multiple choice; true/false, matching,
scenario based and forms usage. Also, there will be multiple controlled versions of the written
evaluation. Local test control procedures, to include test security, will be developed to ensure
test material is not compromised. Local procedures will be developed to address written
evaluation failures. Procedures should address notifications process, re-evaluation time-lines,
documentation and procedures to take in the event of decertification.
5.4.3.5.1.2. (Added) The written DPE will be sourced from the testing database, which is
jointly created between Training and Standardization and Evaluation sections. All test questions
created will contain the corresponding reference from the originating instruction (i.e., DOD, AF,
MAJCOM Sup, or Unit OIs). This assists supervisors and trainers in identifying areas requiring
remedial training in the event of a DPE failure. The written portion of DPEs for critical duty
positions will have a passing score of 80%. The written portion of DPEs for non-critical duty
positions will have a passing score of 70%. (T-2).
5.4.3.5.1.3. (Added) Written DPE tests will be created utilizing the unit Master Task Listing
(MTL). The MTL contains tasks in the Career Field Education Training Plan (CFETP) and the
appropriate AF Form 797s for the specific duty position. For example, tasks in the CFETP
which are required to be signed off for task certification as Restricted Area Entry Controller will
be utilized as references/sources for the written DPE questions. (T-3).
5.4.3.5.1.4. (Added) General knowledge written questions appropriate for the skill level of the
tester may be added to the DPE. For example, a member who is a 3-skill level may be given
suitable questions from the CFETP for their skill level (i.e., Security Forces three general
orders). General knowledge written questions may also be stacked, so that a 5-skill level may be
asked 3-skill level questions and 7-skill levels may be asked 5-skill level questions. This allows
for a broader testing database and better sampling of the member’s knowledge.
5.4.3.5.1.5. (Added) Written DPE questions may be administered by either a computer based
testing program or hard copy (fill in the bubble) type processes. If applicable, recommend units
maintain three hard-copy tests.
5.4.3.5.1.6. (Added) Once the written DPE database is created, it will be reviewed and
approved by the Operations Superintendent, Operations Officer, Security Forces Manager, and
Defense Force Commander (DFC). (T-2).
5.4.3.7.1.1. (Added) Simulated firearms color should be other than the color of real world
weapons and annotated in local OIs. Simulated weapons/firearms that closely resemble (in color
and appearance/style) or are convertible to the actual counterparts will be issued and stored to the
same standard as AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense (FOUO), Group IV weapon standards. (T-2).
5.4.3.7.2.1. (Added) The AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt, will be used for local
accountability procedures as part of the accountability procedures to record when simulated
firearms are signed in/out by unit personnel. (T-2).

5.4.3.7.4.1. (Added) Weapon Simulation Equipment. Units equipped with simulation
equipment will incorporate use/procedures into their training plan. This training will not replace
Force on Force requirements or weapons qualification training, except those granted a waiver for
Group B personnel. (T-2).
5.4.4.3.5.1. (Added) If a DPE expires for a critical or non-critical position while deployed or
within 30 days of return, the DPE may be extended by the DFC or designated rep, for 45
calendar days.
5.4.4.3.9.4. (Added) Personnel assigned to unit staff positions will maintain a DPE for a
minimum of one Flight position commensurate to their rank as determined by the DFC. They
will maintain the appropriate weapons qualifications for the position they will be evaluated on.
EXCEPTION: DFCs may exempt certain staff positions (E-7/0-3 and above) due to rank or
work criteria. Civilians will only conduct a DPE when required by their position description.
(T-2).
6.3.1.1.1. (Added) The goal is to have all SF assigned to the unit proficient on CRT tasks.
DFCs will ensure they have a prioritized training plan to meet this intent while ensuring all
deploying individuals receive CRT. (T-3).
7.2.4.1. (Added) HQ AFSPC/A7SO is appointed as EST OPR for AFSPC SF units.
7.2.8.2. (Added) UDM will notify HQ AFSPC/A7SX of discrepancies a minimum of 14 days
prior to team departure to a Regional Training Center. If notification is within 14 days, contact
HQ AFSPC/A7SXD immediately. (T-2).

                          COLLECTIVE TRAINING/RESILIENCY

A6.1. The following AFSPC collective training principles are in addition to minimum
requirements as outlined in the basic instruction. Unit leaders must know and understand these
principles to effectively embed the concepts into exercises/drills and train their units to achieve
critical mission requirements. These principles provide direction, but are sufficiently flexible to
accommodate local conditions and the judgment of commanders and other leaders.
