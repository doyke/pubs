1.1. Training Objective. This instruction prescribes basic policy and guidance for training
USAF C-17 crewmembers according to AFI 11-202 Volume 1, Aircrew Training.
   1.1.1. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop and maintain a
   high state of mission readiness for the immediate and effective employment in exercises,
   peacekeeping operations, contingencies, and war in any environment. Mission readiness and
   effective employment are achieved through the development and mastery of core
   competencies for C-17 crewmembers. These core competencies include the ability to
   conduct air refueling, tactical ingress, tactical egress, airdrop (for qualified crewmembers),
   assault landings, NVG operations during all phases of flight, instrument procedures, mission
   planning, landing zone ground operations, crew management, and C4/AOC integration. Link
   AFTTP 3-3.C-17, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals requirements into mission and
   continuation training tables while retaining a combat culture, leading edge technologies,
   pushing capabilities while anticipating warfighter needs.
   1.1.2. The secondary objective is to standardize C-17 training requirements into a single
   document to meet requirements for a basic document in AFPD 11-2.
   1.1.3. Throughout this document references are made to training requirements controlled by
   other AFIs and provide guidance derived from those AFIs. The controlling AFI may be
   updated after the publication of this document, so it is necessary to refer to the source
   document AFI for current guidance. If a conflict is identified for a training requirement,
   comply with source document that establishes the training requirement.

Notes
1. References to operations groups and wings may be applied to airlift groups; references to
    operations group training offices may apply to wing-level training offices.
2. AFRC units will send request through 22 AF and AFRC/A3TA. AFRC/A3TA will determine
if waiver needs 19 AF/DO review. ANG units will send waiver to NGB/A3O. NGB/A3O will
determine if waiver needs 19 AF/DO review.
1.6. Use of Flying Hours.
   1.6.1. Structure unit flying training missions to achieve optimum training. Any by-product
   airlift opportunity resulting from training must not degrade the intended training and will
   comply with applicable Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 4515.3R, Air
   Transportation Eligibility, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management and AFI 11-202v1.
       1.6.1.1. It is essential that all personnel at every level prevent the misuse of air mobility
       resources as well as the perception of their misuse when planning and executing local or
       off-station training missions.
       1.6.1.2. See AFI 11-2C-17v3, C-17 Operations Procedures, for off-station training flight
       requirements.
   1.6.2. Training on Operational Missions. Unless specifically prohibited or restricted by
   weapon system operating procedures or specific theater operations order (OPORD), the
   OG/CC exercising operational control may approve upgrade, qualification or special
   qualification training on operational missions. In order to maximize efficient utilization of
   training resources, 618 TACC and tasked units will jointly identify and take maximum
   advantage of opportunities to conduct appropriate continuation training items which may be
   conveniently suited to concurrent operational mission segments. Examples include low-
   levels, assault landings, EROs, circling approaches and air refueling. If necessary, 618
   TACC and tasked units will coordinate training mission numbers for the specific mission
   segment. Commanders will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness and the
   crewmember receiving training is under the supervision of an instructor of like specialty.
   Comply with passenger-carrying restrictions in AFI 11-401, Aviation Management, and AFI
   11-2C-17v3.
1.7. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Comply with the time limitations in Table 1.2.
Crewmembers entered in an in-unit training program leading to qualification (or re-qualification)
will be dedicated to that training program on a full-time basis.
 16                                    AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012


Table 1.2. In-Unit Training Time Limitations.
Training                                     Time Limit                 Time Limit ARC
Re-qualification                             90 days                    180 days
Upgrade Qualification.                       90 days                    180 days
(PCO, LMAD, CPAD, and ACAD)
Instructor Upgrade                           60 days                    180 days
   1.7.1. Training time start date is the date when the first significant training event (a training
   event directly contributing to qualification, certification, or upgrade) has begun (e.g.,
   Loadmaster Simulator (LS), Weapon System Trainer (WST), flight, etc) or 45 days (90 days
   ANG/AFRC) after being attached or assigned to the unit after completion of the formal
   school; whichever occurs first (or as specified in MAJCOM supplement). Training time ends
   with the syllabus completion.
   1.7.2. Sq/CC may extend training time up to 60 days (120 days ARC) through appropriate
   documentation in TMS; no notification to MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) is required.
   Extensions exceeding 60 days (120 days ARC) require MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent)
   approval. Units will request an extension through the appropriate MAJCOM/A3T (or
   equivalent). AMC active duty units use the waiver web linked at the AMC/A3T web site
   before the crewmember exceeds upgrade training time limits.
1.8. Training Documentation. C-17 units will utilize TMS to document training (See
Attachment 2). Units will use the AF IMT 4324, Aviation Resource Management System
(ARMS) Upgrade Worksheet, to update aircrew certifications in ARMS. Blocks 5 – 6 will be
used to document initial, upgrade of, or downgrade of aircrew qualification. The ARMS
Upgrade Worksheet will also be used to document award of specific ARMS ―Q‖ code identifiers.
Specifically, block 22 will contain the following minimum information: ―Q‖ code (i.e. QXXX),
Certification Name (i.e. Phoenix Banner), and date of certification. See Chapter 7 for specific
―Q‖ codes.
1.9. Flight Examiner Usage. Use flight evaluators as instructors for any phase of training to
capitalize on their expertise and experience. Units may use flight evaluators as instructors for
qualification, local upgrade, or corrective-action training. If an evaluator is the primary
instructor to train an individual, the same evaluator should not administer the associated
evaluation.
1.10. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements.
   1.10.1. All instructors should be MR (wing level and below). Instructors must be current
   and qualified in any event that they instruct. Formal Training Unit (FTU) instructors are only
   required to maintain BMC.
   1.10.2. When performing crewmember duties, the following personnel will be under direct
   supervision of an instructor of like specialty:
       1.10.2.1. All non-current crewmembers (See paragraph 4.10.).
       1.10.2.2. All crewmembers in initial, upgrade, or re-qualification flying training unless
       syllabus states direct supervision is not required.
AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012                                                    17


       1.10.2.3. All crewmembers performing restricted flying events listed on the AF Form 8
       as prescribed by AFI 11-202v2 , Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program
       Organization and Administration.
       1.10.2.4. Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ) graduate pilots (MPD) performing pilot-flying
       (PF) duties during air refueling and assault landings.
       1.10.2.5. Loadmasters in mission ready training. (Loadmasters may fly unsupervised on
       local training sorties after completion of a local orientation flight).
       1.10.2.6. Unqualified, FTL E, or AMC staff crew members on indoctrination flight
       orders.
       1.10.2.7. Any other personnel designated by the wing, OG, or Sq/CC.
   1.10.3. For unqualified and Flying Training Level (FTL) E pilots, an instructor must be at a
   set of controls during critical phases of flight.
1.11. Distribution. Units will establish distribution requirements of this AFI.
1.12. Transfer of Aircrews. Before a crewmember will interfly from one unit to another, the
gaining unit will review and assess their qualification and currency. See also AFI 11-401.
   1.12.1. A crewmember qualified in the C-17 according to AFI 11-202v2 will be considered
   qualified throughout the C-17 force. Certified/qualified MR crewmember transferring
   between units, accomplish only unit specific training and any applicable events in which they
   have lost currency. See AFI 11-2C-17v3, Interfly, for additional information.
   1.12.2. For Foreign Military Sales (FMS), guest pilot, and/or exchange officers see training
   requirements in AFI 11-401. Initial and/or continuation training requirements are specified
   in the appropriate MOU, OPLAN, or agreement and should mirror requirements of this AFI
   to maximum extent possible.
1.13. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is ―duty not involving
flying‖ (DNIF) may complete ground training events or simulator training if the member's
physical condition allows it. Consult the flight surgeon initiating AF Form 1042 action
(prescribed by AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards) if the DNIF status includes
ground training limitations.
1.14. Aircrew Rated Management Overview.
   1.14.1. Programmed Flying Training (PFT). AETC/A3R manages the training command’s
   role in the HQ USAF/A3O Flying Training CONOPS. A key product of this process is the
   PFT. The PFT balances available training quotas, FTU capacity, and course requirements on
   a fiscal year basis. Annually, units will send projected PFT requirements to their respective
   MAJCOM training staff which will forward projections to AETC/A3R.
       1.14.1.1. HQ USAF/A3O sponsors an annual PFT conference to balance pipeline
       production requirements and MAJCOM training requests against FTU capacity.
       AETC/A3R allocates quotas to lead and user commands who, in turn, allocate training
       quotas to each unit.
       1.14.1.2. Throughout the training year, MAJCOM training staff and AETC PFT
       managers use assigned/allocated training quotas to assign individual crewmembers into
 18                                    AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012


       the C-17 formal schools. Daily student quota adjustments to the annual PFT are made on
       quota management documents.
1.15. Information Management. HQ AMC/A3T hosts crewmember training information on
web site: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/Open CoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AM-94. ANG
hosts        crewmember          training     information        on   web      site:
https://afkn.wpafb.af.mil/asps/cop/opencop.asp?filter=oo-op-an-31.
1.16. Failure to Progress or Complete Training. If a student fails to progress according to
syllabus or training requirements, the command accomplishing the training will conduct a
Progress Review (PR). The PR can recommend continuation in training or actions IAW AFI 11-
402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges, e.g. a Flying
Evaluation Board (FEB). The formal school will notify the gaining unit of any AFI 11-402
action taken. The ATS contractor will identify students who fail to progress according to the
ATS contract (see Chapter 6).
1.17. Career Enlisted Aviators (CEA). CEA qualifications are not restricted to AFI 36-2101,
Airman Classification, skill level upgrades. All enlisted aircrew qualifications are separate and
distinct from skill level qualification. When an AF Form 8 is completed for the applicable flight
evaluation, then that crewmember is qualified to perform all duties assigned to that crew
qualification regardless of skill level. Aircrew instructor and flight examiner qualifications are
also separate and distinct from On-the-Job Training (OJT) trainer or certifier designation and are
reflected in Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) by use of ―K‖ prefix (aircrew instructor) and ―Q‖
prefix (aircrew flight examiner) identifiers.
1.18. Aircrew Training Quota Management. The following information describes AMC’s
policy and procedures for quota management. This policy was developed from requirements in
AFI 36-2201v1, Military Training Program, 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments
(ADSC), and AFI 11-412, Aircrew Management. This policy is mandatory for all AMC units.
All other units follow MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) guidance.
   1.18.1. AMC Units: Formal Aircrew Training requirements (except for Simulator Refresher
   requirements) will be submitted to the appropriate AMC/A3TF quota manager NLT 30 Sep
   for the following fiscal year. AMC/A3TF will consolidate and crosscheck requests with the
   Pilot Absorption Management System (PAMS) and submit to Air Staff via the annual
   Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD) Data Call and finalized at the annual
   PFT conference.
       1.18.1.1. Other MAJCOMS: Submit Formal Aircrew Training requirements to
       appropriate MAJCOM Functional Managers NLT 30 Sep for the following fiscal year.
       The Formal Aircrew Training requirements (except for Simulator Refresher
       requirements) will be internally coordinated by MAJCOM functional managers and
       submitted to Air Staff via the annual GPRD Data Call and finalized at the annual PFT
       conference.
   1.18.2. Not Used.
   1.18.3. OSS training offices will submit the rank, full name, SSAN, course, and class
   number to AMC/A3TF NLT 45 days prior to class start date (CSD) (65 days for all Joint

  unit on the AMC/A3TF standby list. OSS training offices should reconfirm all scheduled
  training with their units at least 10 days prior to CSD to ensure notification of training, active
  duty service commitments are established, and orders issued. Please submit all candidates
  for training quotas using email only to: AMC.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil. For
  J5AZA1A251 0F5A (JAI), and J5AZB1A251 0M5A Mobile Training Teams (MTT), in
  addition to the information required in paragraph 1.18.4.1, provide unit mailing address, duty
  title, security clearance, supervisor’s name and duty phone, fax number, and e-mail address.
  Send requests for ―Type 5‖ info template to: AMC.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil.
     1.18.3.1. All course prerequisites will be completed NLT 30 days prior to CSD to allow
     for remedial training or substitution. Units will internally identify an alternate candidate
     for each allocated quota.
     1.18.3.2. Training Line Numbers (TLNs) are not to be used for any alternate candidates.
     Units will request cancellation and reissue of TLNs for the aircrew training schedule
     through MAJCOM Quota Manager.
  1.18.4. When submitting local upgrade (secondary method) requests, use the AMC/A3TF
  web-site: https://private.AMC.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/waivers/userlogin.cfm.
     1.18.4.1. Forward the following information to the appropriate quota manager: rank,
     name, upgrade, course, projected start, projected completion, and a point of contact.
     Inform via e-mail when training is complete. If the training being conducted would
     normally incur an active duty service commitment (ADSC), insure required counseling
     and AF Form 63 is completed prior to start of training. Contact your local MPF Formal
     Training office for additional guidance. MILPDS training RIPs will automatically
     generate ADSC requirements.
  1.18.5. When a training allocation cannot be filled, the OSS training office will notify
  AMC/A3TF so the quota may be reallocated. If circumstances prevent an identified
  candidate from attending the training (e.g., DNIF, unable to complete prerequisite training,
  etc.), inform AMC/A3TF immediately. Return all unused quotas to AMC/A3TF NLT 45
  days prior to CSD.
  1.18.6. All no-shows and late cancellations within 7 days of CSD must be explained.
  Forward an initial report of circumstances to AMC/A3TF quota management office within 24
  hours of CSD. This initial notification will be followed by a memorandum of explanation
  from the OG/CC to AMC/A3T within one week. E-mail is the preferred method. Send to:
  AMC.A3T@scott.af.mil and courtesy copy AMC.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil.
  1.18.7. Global Reach Aircraft Commanders Course (GRACC). Active duty units will be
  given priority over AFRC and ANG units due to mandatory upgrade requirements for AMC
  crews established in AFI 11-MDS-v1. Do not submit more than two candidates per wing per
  class without the GRACC scheduler's approval. Submit names NET 45 days and NLT 30
  days prior to CSD. HQ AMC/A3TF will release the class roster 30 days prior to CSD for
  units to confirm the names and make any necessary corrections. Unfilled quotas will be
  available 14 days prior to CSD and units will be notified. HQ AMC/A3TF will no longer
  accept any additions 72 hours/3 days prior to CSD. Units can still cancel 24 hours prior to
  CSD to avoid a no-show being charged to the unit. Questions regarding GRACC scheduling
  can be referred to       HQ AMC/A3TF, DSN 779-7881.

  1.18.8. AMC/A3TF will maintain a standby list for each course offered. Send requests for
  additional quotas to AMC/A3TF for placement on the standby list. If unit capability is in
  jeopardy, AMC/A3TF will coordinate with Air Staff and AETC to add or reallocate
  additional quotas. AMC/A3TF quota managers will coordinate with the OSS training offices
  exclusively. Squadrons or individuals will be referred to their OSS training office. This
  policy is to ensure that all offices responsible for quota management are in synch with each
  other and prevents lost seats. Please submit the name/phone number/e-mail for the primary
  and alternate point of contact for quota management in the OSS.
  1.18.9. AMC units are prohibited from coordinating quota exchanges with other commands.
  OSS/OST offices will forward all requests to the AMC quota manager for coordination with
  other commands. Please allow for extended coordination time when considering this option.
  1.18.10. Senior Officer Training coordination. All Senior Officer training is directed by
  AF/DPO, AF/DPG offices in coordination with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management
  office, AMC/A3TF, and HQ AETC/A3R. Questions regarding the Senior Officer training
  course, availability and prerequisites can be forwarded to HQ AMC/A3TF @ DSN 779-
  3577. No formal actions to schedule training will be taken until directed by AF/DPO or
  AF/DPG in conjunction with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management offices.

                             INITIAL QUALIFICATION TRAINING

2.1. General Requirements. AFI 11-202v1 defines initial qualification training. This chapter
specifies minimum training requirements for initial/mission qualification, re-qualification,
conversion training, and senior officer courses. The primary method of initial/mission
qualification is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course in the ETCA.
When a quota is not available, units will request a waiver to conduct in-unit qualification
training, using formal school courseware.
2.2. Initial Qualification Training Prerequisites: Complete initial qualification prerequisites
in accordance with AFI 11-202v1, the ETCA website, this publication, and the course syllabus.
2.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete ground training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202v1 and this instruction. During formal training,
aircrews may complete (and receive credit for) Aircrew-Specific Mobility Training events in
Table 4.2. See the appropriate formal training course syllabus.
   2.3.1. If events in Table 2.1 are not accomplished at the FTU, they must be completed at the
   gaining unit. The FTU will provide the gaining unit with documentation indicating
   completion of items in Table 2.1 using standard ARMS Event Identifiers.
   2.3.2. Completion of Initial SERE Schools according to AFI 16-1301, Survival, Evasion,
   Resistance, and Escape (SERE) Operations, and initial Aircrew Flight Equipment training
   (during formal school) will establish the follow-on due dates of training (based on the date
   first completing the course) for recurring training requirements.

Notes
1. Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until required training is accomplished
2. Not required for basic aircraft qualification crewmembers or Senior Officers
3. Completed during academic training with ATS contractor
4. Flight Physical and Physiological Training are tracked on the top of each crewmember’s
Individual Training Summary (ITS). Therefore, there is no need to assign and track these
training events in the training module of ARMS

2.4. Flying Training Requirements. Complete flying training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with the formal school syllabus, AFI 11-202v1, and this instruction.
2.5. Conversion Training Requirements. When possible, qualified personnel in other units
will provide the initial cadre. In some instances, it will be necessary for units to form an initial
cadre of crewmember personnel for whom certain qualification training requirements may be
waived. The following conditions will apply to the management of initial cadre crewmember
qualification:
   2.5.1. MAJCOM, in coordination with lead and training command, will develop a training
   plan for unit conversions. The plan should include provisions to form a nucleus of
   crewmembers to include instructors and flight examiners (initial cadre). Converting units
   may request initial cadre waiver of PAI time requirement. Send waiver requests through
AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012                                                      23


   MAJCOM training staff in the format in figure 1.1. In the request, include the most recent
   aircraft flown and total time in that aircraft in the remarks section of the waiver.
   2.5.2. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held (e.g.
   C-130 mission pilot (MP) to C-17 evaluator pilot (EP)) unless previously qualified in the
   conversion aircraft.
   2.5.3. After final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre of instructors and
   flight examiners by crew qualification.
2.6. Multiple Qualifications. Crewmembers will attend a formal initial qualification course for
multiple qualifications in different MDS aircraft (i.e., C-130 and C-17). Crewmembers will as a
minimum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in each aircraft (N/A for senior officers).
2.7. Senior Officer Qualification. AFI 11-202v1 (paragraph 2.5.) identifies senior officer
qualification requirements. Senior Officer Course (SOC) graduates will follow Table 4.6 for
continuation training purposes and will not fly unsupervised in a primary crew position (see
paragraph 4.3.1.5).
   2.7.1. After qualification IAW AFI 11-202v1, and with OG/CC approval, senior officers
   (assigned or attached) may seek training which leads to a higher FTL and/or qualification.
   The unit OSS/OST office is responsible for determining training requirements based on the
   senior officer’s flying experience and familiarity with the weapons system. MAJCOM/A3T
   (or equivalent) will approve the proposed training plan prior to execution.
   2.7.2. Senior Officers that complete full qualification training requirements will maintain
   FTL A continuation training requirements.
2.8. Flight Surgeons. Flight surgeons will complete items listed in Table 4.3 for initial
qualification.
2.9. Requalification Training (RQT). An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of
the qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in
Chapter 4), or completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS (EXCEPTION: When
authorized multiple qualification). The duration of unqualified time is from the date the aircrew
member became unqualified until the specific retraining start date. For Active Duty Service
Commitments for aircrew training, see AFI 36-2107. See AFI 11-202v1 for additional
requalification training limits and requirements.
   2.9.1. RQT may be conducted at the formal school or in-unit following the appropriate
   syllabus (see course list in Chapter 6). Follow training event requirements in the
   appropriate re-qualification course syllabus except as noted in the waiver request.
   2.9.2. Requalification Training Courses. Unqualified crew members will complete the
   appropriate TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 courses outlined below.
       2.9.2.1. Pilot TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 Courses:
           2.9.2.1.1. Unqualified C-17 pilots (over 8 Years) or cross flow aircraft commanders
           from other MDS aircraft will complete the Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ) or Aircraft
           Commander Initial Qualification (ACIQ) formal school flying training course (TX-1)
           and a flight evaluation. An active duty or reserve service commitment is required.

        2.9.2.1.2. Unqualified C-17 pilots (39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment
        or 48 months at the end of any active flying assignment to 8 Years) will complete the
        Aircraft Commander Requalification (ACRQ) or Instructor Pilot Requalification
        (IPRQ) formal school flying training course (TX-2) as appropriate and a flight
        evaluation. An active duty or reserve service commitment is required.
        2.9.2.1.3. Unqualified C-17 pilots (up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying
        assignment or 48 months at the end of any active flying assignment) will complete the
        ATS local Aircraft Commander or Instructor Pilot Requalification (TX-3) course in-
        unit and a flight evaluation. (Note: A waiver is not required for this in-unit
        requalification).
           2.9.2.1.3.1. Squadron Commanders may tailor or expand the TX-3 course based
           on individual proficiency and experience. Unqualified pilots will complete
           training in all delinquent items (including current quarter phase continuation
           training), additional training as directed by the squadron commander, and a flight
           evaluation. See paragraph 4.10.6.2 for additional information.
     2.9.2.2. Loadmaster TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 Courses:
        2.9.2.2.1. Unqualified C-17 loadmasters (Over 8 Years) or cross flow loadmasters
        from other MDS aircraft will complete Loadmaster Initial Qualification (LIQ) ETCA
        formal school flying training (TX-1/301) and a flight evaluation. An active duty or
        reserve service commitment is required.
        2.9.2.2.2. Unqualified C-17 loadmasters (over 39 months at the end of a non-flying
        assignment or 48 months at the end of any active flying assignment to 8 Years) will
        complete the C-17 ATS loadmaster requalification flying training course in-unit (TX-
        2/430) and a flight evaluation. The TX-2 airland course allows prior qualified C-17
        loadmasters to PCS directly to their gaining units without requiring an AETC formal
        school allocation. Prior C-17 airdrop qualified loadmasters may complete the
        loadmaster airdrop requalification (TX-2) course in-unit. An active duty or reserve
        service commitment is required if filling a formal school allocation (listed on the
        ETCA) at the FTU. (Note: A waiver is not required for this in-unit requalification).
        2.9.2.2.3. Unqualified C-17 loadmasters (up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying
        assignment or 48 months at the end of any active flying assignment) will complete in-
        unit training (TX-3/UNQLM) in all delinquent items (including current quarter phase
        continuation training), additional training as directed by the squadron commander,
        and a flight evaluation. (Additional training as directed by the Sq/CC will be
        documented in TMS using the UNQLM Course identifier in TMS). No active duty or
        reserve service commitment is required. (Note: A waiver is not required for this in-
        unit requalification).

                                            Chapter 3

            MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum criteria and training requirements for
mission qualification and certification training. All crewmembers will complete initial
qualification followed by mission certification training (MCT). Except where specifically stated,
units conducting MCT may arrange mission sequence or sequence training events as necessary to
use flying training hours to effectively accomplish the unit mission. Crewmembers in MCT may
participate in exercises (see paragraph 1.6.2.).
3.2. Time Periods for Mission Certification Training. See Table 1.2. A crewmember will be
mission ready (MR) after completion of all ground training and flying training requirements,
review and certification by Sq/CC, or Review and Certification (R&C) Board for aircraft
commander (AC), according to AFI 11-202v2, AMC Supplement. The mission certification start
date is the date when the first significant training event (a training event directly contributing to
certification) has begun (e.g., Loadmaster Simulator (LS), Weapon System Trainer (WST),
flight, etc) or 45-days (90 days ANG/AFRC) after completion of the formal course. Extensions
require MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) approval.                  Units will notify the appropriate
MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) in writing or via AMC/A3T web site before a crewmember
exceeds mission qualification or certification time limits.
   3.2.1. Aircraft Commander Initial Qual (ACIQ) Graduates. Upon completion of all
   requirements from Table 2.1 and Table 3.1, an ACIQ graduate will be counted as a mission
   qualified pilot (FPQ) only for Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) and
   Training Review Panel (TRP) purposes. ACIQ graduates may fly as an FPL on any crew
   including operational missions. ACIQ graduates are not MR ACs and may not fly as A-code
   pilot-in-command until certified by the Sq/CC or R&C Board. The maximum time period
   for pilots completing the aircraft commander initial qualification course to be certified as an
   aircraft commander is 180 days.
   3.2.2. Pilot Initial Qual (PIQ) Graduates. Upon completion of all ground and flying training
   requirements from Table 2.1 and Table 3.1, a PIQ graduate will be counted as a mission
   ready pilot for SORTS and TRP purposes and may fly as a FPQ on any crew including
   operational missions. PIQ graduates are not MR ACs and may not fly as an A-code pilot-in-
   command until completion of the Pilot Checkout (PCO) program and certified by the Sq/CC
   or R&C Board. Maximum time period for pilots completing the PIQ course to be certified
   by the Sq/CC or R&C Board is 90 days.
   3.2.3. Aircraft Commander Qualification (ACQ), PCO, and Requalification Graduates.
   Maximum time period for pilots completing the ACQ/PCO/requalification course to be
   certified as an aircraft commander is 120 days.
   3.2.4. Loadmaster Initial Qual (LIQ) and Requalification Graduates. The maximum time
   period for loadmasters to complete the local orientation flight and mission qualification
   training is within 90 days of the first significant training event upon entering Mission
   Qualification/requalification training. EXCEPTION: First term airmen awaiting the First
   Term Airman’s Center (FTAC) course may accomplish ground training, phase training, and
   local orientation flights to maintain knowledge and skills learned during initial qualification
 26                                   AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012


   training prior to the 90-day time period. If mission qualification training is started prior to
   FTAC, the 90-day time period begins upon completion of FTAC. Document the FTAC
   course dates in TMS.
   3.2.5. ARMS Tracking.
       3.2.5.1. See Table 5.2 for pilot designation codes.
       3.2.5.2. Active duty loadmaster initial qualification graduates will be coded ―FL‖ for
       ARMS tracking and SORTS reporting purposes until mission ready (this does not affect
       the ―ML‖ qualification listed on the AF Form 8).
3.3. Ground Training Requirements. Complete all syllabus and ground training events in
Table 2.1. and Table 3.1. before mission ready certification. Training may be accomplished
concurrently with other training.

Notes:
1. Re-accomplish upon arrival after each permanent change of station.
2. Ensure crewmember is current and/or initial clearance received prior to first flight.
3. Reference AFI 16-1301 for details.
4. See AFPD 11-3, AFI 11-301, AFOSH Standard 127-100 and applicable MAJCOM guidance.
3.4. Flying Training Requirements.
   3.4.1. BAQ crewmembers pursuing MR status will be assigned a Flight Training Level and
   accomplish continuation training requirements IAW Chapter 4. Continuation training
   requirements will be prorated based on the training time start date as defined in paragraph
   1.7.1. Crewmembers will credit events accomplished during MCT IAW paragraph 4.4.1.
   Crewmembers pursuing MR status who fail to accomplish minimum aircrew requirements
   (currency and semi-annual) must fly in a supervised status when that event is required for a
   particular flight.
       3.4.1.1. Crewmembers in MCT who fail to accomplish all semi-annual training
       requirements must complete training IAW paragraph 4.9.7 prior to awarding MR status.
       On a case-by-case basis, the Sq/CC may review the crewmember's training accomplished
       and waive incomplete requirements as required. (Document the waiver in the
       crewmember’s training folder.) Crewmembers non-current for an event may be certified
       MR on a case-by-case basis, but the crewmember will remain NMR for that event and
       will be supervised on any flight requiring that event IAW paragraph 4.9.6.13.4.2. After
       arrival at duty station, all crewmembers will receive a local area briefing and a local
AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012                                                      27


     orientation/mission ready (MR) flight. For pilots, the MR flight may be substituted by a
     simulator sortie focused on events specific to the unit’s mission. If a simulator is used for
     the MR sortie, the local orientation flight remains a separate requirement (not applicable
     for in-unit, re-qualification or upgrade training). The lack of a local briefing and local
     flight does not preclude the crewmember from flying as MR.
     3.4.1.2. Loadmasters. Newly qualified C-17 airdrop loadmasters’ first personnel airdrop
     mission will be flown under the supervision of an instructor loadmaster. The instructor
     will document the completion of training on the initial airdrop qualification AF Form 8 to
     clear the personnel airdrop restriction. Loadmasters should complete personnel airdrop
     training by the end of the semi-annual period. Squadron commanders may extend the
     training time limit by 60 days with documentation in TMS (i.e. for students that graduate
     near the end of the semi-annual period).
     3.4.1.3. Loadmasters that do not complete personnel airdrop training by the end of the
     semi-annual period are non-current for personnel airdrop. Loadmasters non-current in
     excess of 6 months are unqualified in airdrop.
 28                                   AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012

                               CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training
requirements to maintain currency. The unit commander will ensure each crewmember receives
sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.
4.2. Aircrew Status. C-17 crewmembers are assigned to MR, NMR, BMC, or BAQ status.
   4.2.1. Mission Ready (MR). For SORTS reporting, operational tasking, and deployments, a
   MR crewmember is defined as an available, qualified crew member. Aircraft commander
   certification is a prerequisite to serving as a MR aircraft commander.
   4.2.2. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). A crewmember that is unqualified, non-current or
   incomplete in required continuation training. See paragraph 4.10 for specific guidance on
   crewmembers who are non-current or incomplete in required continuation training.
   4.2.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A NMR crewmember assigned to MAJCOM
   headquarters, NAF, EMTF, 618 TACC, USAF EC, CRG, AMOG, FTU, WIC, or direct
   reporting unit who has satisfactorily completed mission qualification training and does not
   maintain MR status, but maintains familiarization in the command or unit’s operational
   mission.
       4.2.3.1. The crewmember may maintain certification in some aspects of the unit mission
       and is able to attain full qualification in the unit mission within 45 days.
       4.2.3.2. FTU BMC crewmembers are certified to conduct all aspects of the AETC
       training mission. AETC instructors must be certified in the training/unit mission before
       performing instructor duties. AETC crewmembers may fly CONUS (includes Alaska
       and Hawaii) and Caribbean 618 TACC-directed missions, but will comply with MR
       requirements to fly all other 618 TACC-directed missions.
       4.2.3.2. (ALTUSAFB) Aircrew members requiring Mission Ready (MR) status for
       contingency taskings will accomplish additional training to regain MR status prior to
       deployments.
       4.2.3.3. BMC crewmembers may log instructor or evaluator time for the portion of the
       mission for which they are current and qualified.
   4.2.4. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). A crewmember that has satisfactorily completed
   initial qualification training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.
   4.2.5. MR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers must accomplish and/or maintain the
   requirements in AFI 11-202v1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the
   ground and semi-annual flying continuation tables.
4.3. Flying Training Levels.
   4.3.1. The Sq/CC determines the training level (TL) before the start of each semi-annual
   period. Assign new unit crewmembers a TL during in-processing. Base TL on experience
   and aircraft proficiency. Crewmembers may have a different flying training level (FTL) for
AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012                                                    29


   different flying qualifications (i.e. a crewmember may be a FTL A airland aircraft
   commander, but a FTL C airdrop copilot).
      4.3.1.1. FTL A - Highly Experienced Crewmembers. (As a guide, crewmembers
      having 10 or more years of operational flying experience) This may include MR or NMR
      MAJCOM headquarters, 618 TACC personnel, AETC instructors, NAF personnel, USAF
      EC instructors, WIC instructors and WIC students, Wing, OG, and Sq/CCs, operations
      officers, personnel assigned to OG evaluation positions, and any instructors assigned
      primarily to staff duties. Note: NMR crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM staff, 618
      TACC, USAF EC, TALCE, AMOG, FTU, or direct reporting unit may be categorized as
      BMC and assigned to FTL A and may fly unsupervised on local training missions
      provided they are current and qualified for that mission.
      4.3.1.2. FTL B - Experienced MR Crewmember. (As a guide, crewmembers having
      between 5-10 years of operational flying experience)
      4.3.1.3. FTL C - MR Crewmember. Initially assign inexperienced MR crewmembers
      to FTL C and individuals pursuing MR status after initial qualification training. (As a
      guide, crewmembers having less than 5 years of operational flying experience) This
      training level may also be assigned to flight test, WIC cadre, and other staff crew
      members.
      4.3.1.4. FTL D - No longer used.
      4.3.1.5. FTL E - BAQ or BMC non-instructor staff. FTL E may include senior
      officers, MAJCOM, NAF, and 618 TACC staff who are not maintaining MR or instructor
      status. FTL E requirements are insufficient for MR status and crewmembers assigned to
      this FTL will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times.
   4.3.2. Change of FTL. Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a crewmember to a
   level requiring fewer events. (Exception: Units associating FTLs with crew positions may
   change FTLs after upgrade i.e. instructor upgrade). Place BAQ crewmembers into a different
   FTL any time after attaining MR status. Prorate events upon changing training levels.
4.4. Training Events/Tables. Standardized ARMS training event identifiers and descriptions
are listed in Chapter 7.
   4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment.          Credit events accomplished on training,
   operational missions, and satisfactory evaluations toward currency requirements and
   establish a subsequent due date. Use date of evaluation as the date of accomplishment for all
   flying training currency events that were successfully accomplished during the formal course
   evaluation. Continuation training events accomplished during upgrade training prior to the
   evaluation may be credited towards the requirements for the current crew position. Do not
   log training events for the upgrading crew position prior to the evaluation. EXCEPTION:
   ACIQ and PCO graduates may credit night AR accomplished during the course to semi-
   annual training requirements.
   4.4.2. For an unsatisfactory flight evaluation, do not log continuation training requirements
   for those qualifications graded Q-3 until re-qualified.
   4.4.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.
   EXCEPTION: Not applicable to phase training CBTs.
 30                                   AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012


   4.4.4. Instructor training requirements and responsibilities. Instructors and flight examiners
   may credit 50 percent of their total requirements while instructing or evaluating.
   EXCEPTION: Instructor and flight examiner pilots may not credit any takeoffs, landings, or
   air refueling flown by another pilot.
   4.4.5. FTU OG/CCs and the Commandant USAFWS may seek, obtain MAJCOM approval,
   and publish ground and flying continuation training requirements in local training
   procedures.
   4.4.6. Documenting Aircrew Training Events.
      4.4.6.1. All training events will be recorded in ARMS.
          4.4.6.1.1. Training events conducted during block training or phase training may be
          consolidated under one ARMS entry.
          4.4.6.1.2. Combined training events may have only one ARMS entry.
          4.4.6.1.3. Input all one-time events and events required for permanent change-of-
          station (PCS) in the ARMS database. Units may maintain one-time events on the
          crewmember’s currency report.
4.5. Continuation Training Requirements.
   4.5.1. Completion and tracking of continuation training is ultimately the responsibility of the
   individual crewmember. Crewmembers should actively work with unit schedulers and
   training offices to ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described in this
   chapter.
   4.5.2. Ground Training Events. Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Table 4.1,
   and Table 4.2.
      4.5.2.1. Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 leads to non-mission ready status. See
      paragraph 4.10 for regaining mission ready status.
      4.5.2.2. Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.2 does not lead to
      non-mission ready status but may restrict member from certain missions.
      4.5.2.3. Crewmembers (i.e., NAF, MAJCOM, AMWC, etc.) attached to units may
      accomplish ground training events at locations other than their unit of attachment. The
      crewmember is responsible for reporting accomplished training events to their unit of
      attachment (ARMS office).
      4.5.2.4. Crewmembers performing extended alert duty (more than 72 hours) may
      accomplish ground training that does not degrade required response time or mission
      accomplishment. Specify requirements and or restrictions in the MAJCOM supplement
      and the unit supplement.
      4.5.2.5. Flight Surgeons use requirements in Table 4.3.
      4.5.2.6. (Added-ALTUSAFB) 97 OG Block Training. The following paragraphs
      outline responsibilities and procedures for the flying squadrons in support of wing
      aircrew ground continuation training activities (block training). Block training allows
      completion of most ground continuation requirements in a single week.
AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012                                                          31


           4.5.2.6.1. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Procedures. The annual block training calendar is
           published in October by 97 TRS/TRT for all training providers to approve. Once
           approved, it is available for flying squadrons to schedule aircrew through Graduate
           Training Integration Management System (GTIMS). Flying squadrons will schedule
           individuals for training throughout the year. Units that identify possible errors or
           conflicts in the block training schedule should contact 97 TRS/TRT as soon as
           possible to resolve the error or conflict. Block training classes should be taught on
           the same day of the week.
                4.5.2.6.1.1. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Squadrons should use the block training
                program for accomplishment of the listed training events. Block training is
                organized to minimize the impact of ground training days on aircrew scheduling
                and maximize the efficiency of training resources. Block training classes not
                meeting scheduling enrollment criteria established by the respective training
                manager may be cancelled on short notice. See GTIMS remarks and current
                block training Rules of Engagement (ROE) memorandum for class requirements.
                Each squadron is allocated an equal number of slots per class. These slots should
                be filled no later than 3 duty days prior to the class date. Slots that are not filled
                are considered extra and can be utilized by any squadron. All slots should be
                filled by the close of business 2 duty days prior to the start of class. Any
                remaining slots that are not filled will be cancelled the day prior to class. If
                classes/slots are cancelled the squadron will be notified.
                4.5.2.6.1.2. (Added-ALTUSAFB) Specific questions concerning block training
                events or scheduling conflicts at the squadron level should be funneled through 97
                TRS/TRT. If the 97 TRS/TRT block training representative is not available, then
                squadrons should contact the training provider.

Notes:
1. If accomplished in the WST, will only be logged during Distributed Mission
Training/Distributed Mission Operation (DMT/DMO) missions linked with another C-17. Units
should schedule airdrop phase periods to be conducted in DMO (linked) mode to the maximum
extent possible.
2. PNAF qualified crew members only.
3. Only for select crew members maintaining certification in accordance with unit DOC
statements. Non-currency in this event does not affect airdrop currency/qualification in other
airdrop events.
4. Two of the four Instructor Tactical Sortie (ITS) requirements for pilots may be substituted with
Basic Tactical Sorties (BTS) each semi-annual period if required due to instructor availability.
One of the two ITS requirements for aircraft commanders may be substituted with a BTS for
Expeditionary Airlift Squadron (EAS) deployed crewmembers.
5. Unqualified in the aircraft (unqualified in airdrop for airdrop events) if non-current in excess of
6 months. See Para 4.10.6.2.
6. 100% of FP requirements may be logged during LZ events while performing Pilot Monitoring
(PM) duties and 50% of FP requirements may be logged while performing Go-Around after
Touchdowns (GOATs).
7. Simulator requires full operational motion and visual systems in order to credit the event.
8. Not required for SOC graduates.
9. FTL C aircraft commanders who are also airdrop copilots will complete the airdrop phase
training lessons plus an ISS every quarter. This requirement does not apply to airland aircraft
commanders.
10. Pilots may extend AR currency via simulator if current from a previous AR accomplished in
the aircraft.
11. WIC Students are exempt from current Phase Simulator Training but must complete CBTs.
12. 50% of this requirement for FLT C aircraft commanders may be accomplished in the WST.
13. The mission scenario of phase training is not required for FTU instructors who maintain
BMC.

Notes:
1. Non-current loadmasters up to six months regain currency by demonstrating proficiency to
the satisfaction of an instructor loadmaster. Non-current loadmasters in excess of six months
are unqualified and require Sq/CC directed re-qualification training and an evaluation. IL/EL
may log the event while performing instructor or evaluator duties. MAJCOM and NAF Staff
loadmasters require one proficiency sortie every 90 days.
2. PNAF qualified crew members only.
3. MAJCOM, NAF, DET 2, AMCAOS, C-17 WIC, 97 AMW, and flight test loadmasters
require one actual annually. This requirement will not be waived.
4. Do not use the simulator to maintain or regain currency during two consecutive periods
(i.e. if the simulator is used to regain currency, actual Dual Row Airdrop (DRA) must be
accomplished in the aircraft during the next period).
5. Only for select crew members maintaining Dual Row Airdrop flying currency in
accordance with unit DOC statements. One drop must be from the LM1 position and one
from the LM2 position. Non-currency/unqualified status in DRA does not affect airdrop
currency/qualification in other airdrop events. Crew members non-current in DRA exceeding
six months require DRA requalification.
6. Only for JPADS qualified loadmasters.

4.6. Flight Surgeon Continuation Flying Requirements. Flight Surgeons will comply with
the requirements of this volume and AFI 11-202v1. Flight surgeons require one sortie in any
qualified MDS every 60 days. See AFI 11-202v1 table for flying continuation training
requirements. See Table 4.3 for flight surgeon ground continuation training requirements.
    4.6.1. Flight Surgeon loss of flying currency.
        4.6.1.1. Units will notify the MAJCOM Command Surgeon when attached Flight
        Surgeons exceed 60 days between flights. Flight Surgeons that exceed 60 days between
        sorties (but less than 180 days) require a review of aircraft exits and oxygen systems by
        the a member of the flight crew designated by the Aircraft Commander prior to the flight
        in accordance with AMC SG guidance.
        4.6.1.2. Units will notify the MAJCOM Command Surgeon when attached Flight
        Surgeons exceed 180 days between sorties. Additionally, Flight Surgeons that exceed 180
        days between sorties require a review of aircraft exits and oxygen systems by a member
        of the flight crew designated by the Aircraft Commander and compliance with local
        qualification guidance prior to the next flight.

4.7. Senior Officer Continuation Flying Requirements.
   4.7.1. Senior Officers that complete full qualification training requirements will maintain
   continuation training requirements for the appropriate crew position; otherwise, Senior
   Officers will complete training requirements in Table 4.6
   4.7.2. SOQ pilots are not required to complete Phase CBTs or Phase Simulators, but are
   allowed and encouraged to complete them.
   4.7.3. SOQ pilots must fly under the direct supervision of an instructor pilot at all times.
   The instructor must consider prior SOQ experience, currency and proficiency and use sound
   judgment and ORM principles when determining which maneuvers the SOQ will be allowed
   to perform. SOQ pilots may perform NVG duties (PF or PM) only if qualified on NVGs.

   Notes:
   1. Mandatory grounding event after expiration date.
   2. May qualify for 'academics only' or Executive Refresher Course. See AFI11-403
   for details.
   3. This event does not satisfy the IRC examination requirement within the check
   cycle.
   4. Member will go unqualified if non-current in this event for greater than 6 months.
   5. Only required if qualified in NVGs and/or RNAV.
   6. May perform PF duties only on training missions w/o passengers, limited to PM
   duties with passengers.
   7. May accomplish 100% in the WST.
   8. Mandatory grounding item; individual will not fly until required training is

   accomplished. Flight physicals become due 366 days after the previous physical, and
   expire after the 455th day or as indicated on the AF IMT 1042, whichever occurs
   first. The required frequency may vary to address waivers and/or individual
   physical limitations (as determined by the Flight Surgeon), but in no case will
   exceed 455 days.

4.8. Ancillary Training. Guidance or instruction that contributes to mission accomplishment,
but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. AFI 11-2C-17v1 is not the
governing directive for completion of ancillary training events. In accordance with AFI 11-
202v1, the source AFI provides training frequency for these events unless an approved waiver
has been authorized. See Unit Deployment Manger representative to ensure compliance with
additional non-aircrew specific training requirements. Accomplish Ancillary and Expeditionary
Skills Training in accordance with AFI 36-2201 v1. Except for FTU instructors, C-17 aircrew
members fulfill the Enabler Role and will maintain Mission Ready Status for a Major
Contingency Operation (MCO).
4.9. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202v1 describes proration of training requirements for
crewmembers not available for flying duties. In addition, prorate training for non-availability
due to contingency alerts and contingency flying TDYs when the contingency precludes training
for certain mission events (PACAF: also contingency operations from home station). This
authority must be used judiciously, especially when prorating the same crewmember for
consecutive semi-annual training periods.
   4.9.1. PIQ graduates and LMs will accomplish remaining events depending on the number
   of full months remaining in the quarter in which they graduated from initial school or upon
   completion of requalification training. All other volume training requirements should be
   prorated based on instructions in Table 4.7
       4.9.1.1. Two months remaining:
          4.9.1.1.1. Pilots: Accomplish one instrument simulator sortie (ISS) and one basic
          tactical sortie (BTS) or instructor tactical sortie (ITS).
          4.9.1.1.2. Loadmasters: Accomplish one Proficiency Sortie (PS).
       4.9.1.2. One month remaining:
          4.9.1.2.1. Pilots: Accomplish one ISS and one BTS or ITS.
          4.9.1.2.2. Loadmasters: No requirement.
       4.9.1.3. Crewmembers enrolled in PCO, IAC, CPAD, ACAD, LAD and ILM are not
       exempt from quarterly phase training. Crewmembers enrolled in initial or requalification
       courses at the formal training unit are exempt from quarterly phase training simulator
       requirements (based on projected graduation dates). Phase training CBT lessons must still
       be completed.
       4.9.1.4. Phase Training. Phase training should be accomplished with an MP/IP and a FP
       together in the WST. If an MP/IP is not available, any pilot may be substituted. For
       newly qualified crewmembers (PIQ, ACIQ, LIQ, CAD and LAD graduates), phase
       currency (for simulator and CBT lessons) begins during the next currency period.
AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012                                                     41


       4.9.1.5. Phase CBTs are a grounding event. Annual written examinations are
       incorporated in phase training CBTs. Failure to complete required phase CBT results in
       annual written examinations being incomplete. Missed Phase CBTs must be completed
       prior to accomplishing any phase training for the current quarter.
   4.9.2. Use this formula to determine training requirements: number of months available
   times the event volume divided by the number of months in the training period. Round down
   to the nearest whole number, but not less than 1 (e.g. 5.6 rounds to 5).
       4.9.2.1. Use Table 4.7 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if
       absence is at least 15 cumulative days.
       4.9.2.2. When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) during the training cycle
       to a unit flying the same model aircraft and enters the same FTL or lower, credit training
       accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time
       available (e.g., time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not
       available) during the training period. Time available starts 7-days after sign-in for
       CONUS and 14-days after sign-in for OCONUS or on the date of actual accomplishment
       of the first training event, whichever occurs first. Subtract previous accomplishments
       from the prorated total to determine remaining requirements.
   4.9.3. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels.        If
   requirements are prorated do not credit events accomplished while in the former FTL.

4.10. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Declare individuals NMR if they fail to
maintain flying currency, fail to complete semi-annual flying continuation training requirements,
or fail to complete ground continuation training requirements. The following guidance applies:
   4.10.1. Crewmembers are non-current the day after event currency expires; (i.e., a
   crewmember that accomplished an event with monthly currency on 1 September becomes
   non-current on 1 November).
   4.10.2. If a crewmember is NMR for failure to complete required continuation training, the
   OG/CC has two options to keep MR status:
       4.10.2.1. Waive the required training. The individual remains on MR status.
       4.10.2.2. Place the crewmember in supervised status for that event (individual flies with
       an instructor of like specialty) until required training is accomplished. The crewmember
       cannot deploy until currency is regained. See Table 4.8 for exceptions.
42                                   AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012


  4.10.3. Crewmembers NMR for Airland flying events may fly unsupervised, until MR status
  is regained, on CONUS and OCONUS missions on which events in the delinquent category
  are not accomplished (OG/CC approval not required for local, routine, and non-contingency
  missions). Note: An individual non-current in phase sims (G261-264 and G266-269),
  instrument simulator sortie (G294), takeoffs (P020), landings (P190), night landings (P192)
  instrument approaches (P070, P100, P110), or proficiency sortie (M010) will not fly
  unsupervised on any sortie (see paragraph 1.10).
  4.10.4. Pre-Deployment. OG/CCs may modify the mission scenario and content of
  loadmaster Phase simulator training and day two pilot Phase simulator training immediately
  preceding the deployment for preparation. To ensure ATS contractual compliance,
  coordination with AMC/A3TA is required at least one month prior to training
  implementation. After approval from AMC/A3TA, OG/CCs will ensure the modified
  mission scenario is coordinated with the ATS Project Officer/Quality Assurance
  Representative (PO/QAR) and ATS site manager at least three weeks prior to training
  implementation. Locally developed scenario will accomplish contractually agreed upon and
  ATS-stated objectives.
  4.10.5. Deployment. For deployments of 45 days or greater, aircraft commanders and pilots
  will adhere to the following guidance for the duration of that deployment to include
  positioning and depositioning legs:
     4.10.5.1. Air refueling currency for FTL C aircraft commanders is extended to 60 days.
     4.10.5.2. Aircraft commanders not current for air refueling may fly in command on any
     mission not requiring air refueling.
     4.10.5.3. Aircraft commanders not current for assault landings may fly in command on
     any mission not requiring assault landings.
     4.10.5.4. Pilots (FPQ) not current for assault landings my fly on any missions not
     requiring assault landings.
     4.10.5.5. One of the two semi-annual ITS requirements for aircraft commanders may be
     substituted with a BTS for EAS deployed crewmembers.
     4.10.5.6. Reconstitution. OG/CCs will direct training requirements for crewmembers
     whose Phase training was missed during deployment.
  4.10.6. Regaining Currency.
     4.10.6.1. For a loss of currency up to 6 months, a crewmember must demonstrate
     proficiency in the aircraft or simulator (as appropriate as defined in Table 4.4 or Table
     4.5) with an Air Force instructor (or ATS instructor for simulator creditable events) in all
     delinquent items. Crewmembers non-current for up to 6 months will maintain their
     current training level (no TMS documentation required).
     4.10.6.2. Loss of currency exceeding 6 months. For events identified in Table 4.4 (Note
     6) or Table 4.5 (Note 1) as leading to unqualified status, the crewmember is unqualified
     in the aircraft and must complete Sq/CC-directed requalification training and an aircrew
     evaluation according to AFI 11-2C-17v2, C-17 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. For all
     other currency events, regain currency by demonstrating proficiency in the aircraft or
     simulator to the satisfaction of an Air Force instructor (or ATS instructor for simulator
AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012                                                         43


      creditable events) in all delinquent items. Re-accomplish missed phase sims as directed
      by Sq/CC. Accomplish CBTs for each missed quarter up to one year.
   4.10.7. Failure to Complete Semi-annual Flying Training Events. The OG/CC or equivalent
   may waive flying continuation training and currency events. At the end of each training
   period, the squadron commander will review ARMS products for those crewmembers who
   failed to accomplish all required flying training events (includes all events listed in the flying
   continuation training tables, Table 4.4 and Table 4.5.). The squadron commander will either
   direct training necessary for the individual to regain MR status or request OG/CC waiver. If
   the ARMS review shows enough flying events were recently accomplished to ensure MR
   proficiency, OG/CC or equivalent may waive the requirements. This waiver authority must
   be used judiciously. The intent is to ensure crewmembers receive the proper quantity of
   flying events to remain proficient and allow OG/CC to determine MR status and additional
   training requirements when those training quotas are not met. Waivers for training or
   currency events missed in consecutive training periods require MAJCOM approval.
   4.10.8. Failure to Complete Ground Training Events. The OG/CC or equivalent may waive
   ground continuation training events identified in Table 4.1, Table 4.2, and Table 4.3. This
   waiver authority will be used judiciously. The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the
   individual crewmember’s experience and proficiency level (i.e. waivers will not be based on
   a crewmember’s availability). OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the
   waiver. The make-up training should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity. This
   waiver is for unforeseen circumstances only and only for events that will not degrade mission
   accomplishment.
      4.10.8.1. With Sq/CC (or designated representative) approval, an individual NMR for
      failure to complete NVG Refresher Training (NV03) may fly unsupervised on missions
      not requiring the overdue event.
   4.10.9. Phase Training WST/LS Lesson Waivers. Make-up training is not required when
   phase training simulator lessons are waived. However, commanders may require completion
   of missed phase training based on individual proficiency and/or simulator availability.
   4.10.10. Noncurrency in the applicable currency events of the ground and flying
   continuation training tables has the following consequences:

Notes:
1. Includes all airland flying events listed in Tables 4.4 and 4.5 except for Secure Radio,
ISOPREP, and HAVE QUICK. See also paragraph 4.10.3.
2. This restriction applies only to the delinquent airdrop event for loss of currency up to six
months. (For example, pilots/loadmasters may perform container delivery system or heavy
equipment drops while non-current for personnel drops.) If a delinquent airdrop event exceeds
six months, the individual is unqualified in airdrop. (EXCEPTION: Unqualified status in DRA
does not affect airdrop currency in other events.)
3. Pilots non-current for NVG airdrop may still perform airland NVG events if current and
qualified.
4. Pilots non-current for Formation events may still perform airdrop events without an instructor
on sorties not requiring Formation. Non-currency in formation events does not affect airdrop
qualification.

                                      UPGRADE TRAINING

5.1. Description. This chapter identifies general prerequisites and training requirements for
upgrade. See minimum flying-hour requirements and prerequisites in Table 5.1.
     5.1.1. General. The flying time prerequisites for upgrade are based on the pilot or
     loadmaster having gained the knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish
     the unit’s missions. Sq/CCs will ensure their continuation training programs emphasize these
     areas. Flying experience must include left seat time before entering formal school upgrade
     training. Crewmembers will have an in-depth knowledge of systems, procedures, and
     instructions before entering the formal upgrade program.
     5.1.2. OG/CC is designated waiver authority for flying hour prerequisites for entry into
     formal upgrade courses (see Table 5.1).

Notes:
1. Prior qualified pilots will have 100 total C-17 hours prior to certification (includes formal school
time but does not include ―other‖ or simulator time).
2. Instructor candidates should have an A1A251 primary AFSC (or higher); A1A271 is desired.
3. Previously qualified instructors may upgrade in-unit without re-accomplishing the formal AETC
instructor course with OG/CC approval. MAJCOM waivers are not required. Document the
OG/CC approval and training in TMS.

4. OG/CC is the approval authority for non-squadron commander certified ACs to attend ACAD.
5. Total flying hours represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a ―military‖
pilot including UPT, Student, and ―Other‖ time (but does not include time in another aircrew
specialty). Simulator time is credible to meet total flying hour requirement.
6. C-17 simulator time does count towards PAA. Do not count ―Other‖ time towards PAA time.
5.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). The Mobility Pilot Development aircraft commander
upgrade program is a continuous upgrade process broken into three Phases to replace legacy
copilot and aircraft commander upgrade training courses. The MPD program includes the Pilot
Initial Qualification (PIQ) formal training course, continuation training (to include Instrument
Simulator Sortie (ISS) simulator lessons) and the Pilot Check-out (PCO) course. All MPD pilots
will be dual-seat qualified and maintain qualification requirements according to AFI 11-2C-
17v2. MPD pilots are not Aircraft Commanders but should be considered in continuous aircraft
commander training upon graduation from the FTU until AC certification. This training should
take, but is not limited to, approximately two years. As always, training timelines are based on
performance, and at the discretion of the Sq/CC, should be tailored to match an individual’s
capabilities and experience level.
   5.2.1. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) Overview.
       5.2.1.1. Squadrons must ensure that PIQs get balanced exposure to the left and right
       seats to ensure proficiency and currency with the flying and non-flying duties in both seat
       positions.    Squadron commanders will ensure pilots receive sufficient training
       opportunities to gain experience prior to Aircraft Commander Upgrade.
       5.2.1.2. MPD Continuation Training. This training involves both simulator ISS and
       flying training conducted during local and mission sorties. The 3.0 hour ISS will focus
       on pilot flying duties for air refueling, assault landings, tactical arrivals, and departures
       (see event description in Chapter 7 and ATS contractor provided lesson plans).
       5.2.1.3. Certification. A pilot will be mission ready (MR) after completion of all ground
       training, mobility training, and flying training requirements.
   5.2.2. Aircrew Designation Codes. AFI 11-401 defines pilot aviation codes. For
   standardization, use the codes from Table 5.2 (3rd letter designator distinguishes the status
   for a MPD pilot who completed formal training with evaluation (graduate). Active duty
   loadmasters will use the ARMS code ―FL‖ to designate NMR status. (This ARMS code does
   not affect the ML qualification status listed on the AF Form 8.)

Table 5.2. Mobility Pilot Designation Codes.
If first two are ―FP‖   Qualified Pilot. Then 3rd character is:
                        ―N‖                Qualified Non-Mission Ready (NMR). This is used for
                                           the following:
                                           1. Pilot currently in ACIQ, ACQ, or PCO course and
                                           has not completed qualification checkride
                                           2. Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ) course graduate

                         ―L‖                Qualified Non-Mission Ready (NMR). This is used for
                                            the following:
                                            1. Graduate of aircraft commander course (ACIQ,
                                            ACQ, PTX2, PCO, local upgrade) in local mission
                                            ready training
                                            2. Graduates of aircraft commander course (FPLs) who
                                            have not acquired enough PAA hours for AC R&C, but
                                            have completed all local mission ready training
                                            requirements (except SOC graduates).
                         ―Q‖                Qualified Mission Ready (MR). This code is used for
                                            the following:
                                            1. Qualified Mission Ready MPD Pilot

                         ―N‖                Non-Mission Ready (NMR) Aircraft Commander. This
                                            code is used:
                                            1. If the MP will be NMR for an EXTENDED period
                                            of time (greater than a month)
                                            2. Not used for short duration NMR status due to DNIF
                                            or short term currency deficiencies

                         the mission.
If ―EP‖                  Fully Certified/Qualified Evaluator Pilot who is performing evaluator
                         duties on the mission.
5.3. Aircraft Commander (AC). See minimum flying-hour requirements in Table 5.1
   5.3.1. General. The flying time prerequisites for upgrade are based on the pilot having
   gained the knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish the unit’s missions.
   Sq/CCs will ensure their continuation training programs emphasize these areas. AC
   candidates will have an in-depth knowledge of systems, procedures, and instructions before
   entering the formal upgrade program. The following guidance applies:
          5.3.1.1. AC Candidate. All pilots are considered AC candidates.
          5.3.1.2. MPD Pilot Checkout. The process for aircraft commander certification will
          include the MPD Pilot Checkout Course (PCO) which culminates in an Operational
          Mission Evaluation per AFI 11-2C-17v2.
          5.3.1.3. AC Certification. Pilots will not be designated pilot in command until certified
          as an aircraft commander by the Sq/CC. Pilots will complete all ―tasks and events
          required‖ in Table 5.1.
   5.3.2. Global Ready Aircraft Commander Course (GRACC). GRACC is a three-phase
   process designed to familiarize pilots with all aspects of operating in the en route system.
   The three phases are divided as follows: Pilot to Aircraft Commander Phase I (V280), Pilot
 48                                    AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012


   to Aircraft Commander Phase II (V281), and HQ AMC Orientation Tour (V282). See
   Chapter 7 for course description.
       5.3.2.1. Applicability. GRACC training is highly encouraged for active duty pilots
       upgrading to aircraft commander (mandatory for AMC and AFRC). GRACC is also
       highly encouraged for mobility forces ANG pilots. The OG/CC will determine
       attendance requirements for their pilots. A one-time course, completion is transferable
       between all mobility weapon systems. Waiver authority is OG/CC or equivalent.
       5.3.2.2. Documentation. Completion of each phase of GRACC is documented in ARMS
       (V280, V281, and V282). Document the completion of the entire course via the AF Form
       4324 as ―GRACC‖ using ARMS event identifier Q280.
       5.3.2.3. Training Guides. GRACC workbooks are available for download on the
       AMC/A3T CoP. Workbooks should be carried on all sorties to maximize training
       opportunities. Additional information on GRACC can be located on the ETCA website,
       https://etca.randolph. af.mil/showcourse.asp?as_course_id=GRACC.
       5.3.2.4. Phase I. Pilot To Aircraft Commander Phase I (V280). This phase consists of
       completing the V280 generic MAF workbook. MPD Pilots will complete this V280
       workbook NLT 180 days after becoming mission ready. The workbook will help new
       pilots become familiar with moving a mission within the Mobility Enroute System and
       other associated requirements. For non-AMC unit or FAIP/OSA pilots transitioning to
       MAF aircraft, V280 will not be accomplished; however V281 and V282 are still required.
       5.3.2.5. Phase II. Pilot To Aircraft Commander Phase II (V281). The second phase
       consists of completing a second MDS-specific workbook. V281 will serve to review all
       the objectives in Phase I (V280) with more MDS specific topics. Pilots will complete
       V281 before Phase III (V282) and starting their formal aircraft commander upgrade &
       certification course. Aircraft Commander candidates who have transferred from non-
       AMC units or FAIP/OSA assignments will complete V281 and V282 before AC
       certification during an R&C board. MAJCOMs may substitute an alternate aircraft-
       specific Training Guide for the Phase II Training Guide.
       5.3.2.6. Phase III. HQ AMC Orientation Tour Phase III (V282). The third phase visits
       HQ AMC and the 618 TACC. This event provides an in-depth look at selected 618
       TACC and AMC operations as well as an opportunity to interact with command senior
       staff. Ideally, this course should be completed by aircraft commander candidates after
       completing Phase II, but before attending formal aircraft commander upgrade training.
       V282 should be completed prior to AC certification.
5.4. Aircrew Instructor Program. The instructor course is designed to teach selected
crewmembers fundamentals and concepts of instructing. Instructor candidates will be selected
based on experience, judgment, ability to instruct, flying skill, and technical knowledge.
   5.4.1. For instructor upgrade prerequisites, see Table 5.1
       5.4.2.1. All instructor candidates will demonstrate to a flight examiner their ability to

       qualified instructors for all mission qualification events in which they maintain currency.
AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012                                                       49


      EXCEPTION: Pilot airdrop instructors will be designated by the Sq/CC after
      completion of IAC and lead upgrade.
   5.4.3. New instructor candidates will attend the formal C-17 ATS instructor course. Waivers
   will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis if formal school course slots are not available.
   5.4.4. Instructor candidates who previously attended a formal instructor course for instructor
   qualification and were certified in any US Air Force aircraft may upgrade in-unit without
   completing the ATS IAC or ILM course. In-unit instructor upgrades require OG/CC
   approval. MAJCOM waivers are not required. Unit commanders determine training required
   to complete upgrade. Utilize the standardized MAF C-17 in-unit instructor course in TMS to
   document approval and training. Refer to Table 1.2 for in-unit training time limits.
   5.4.5. Instructor Responsibilities:
      5.4.5.1. Instructors are responsible to provide thorough preflight briefings and critiques.
      Instructors will comply with requirements of mission outlines, as appropriate, for the type
      of mission being flown.
      5.4.5.2. Instructors will review each trainee’s TMS training record prior to performing
      each training flight or session.
      5.4.5.3. Instructors will ensure all required upgrade training items are completed, signed
      off, and proficiency is demonstrated IAW AFI 11-2C-17v2 grading requirements before
      recommending trainee for evaluation, or certifying the student as qualified in a tactic or
      mission. Instructors should further ensure training, operations sections, and the flight
      commander or designated representative is apprised of the trainee’s status.
      5.4.5.4. IPs must be fully aware they are responsible at all times for flight conduct and
      aircraft safety. Should the trainee’s judgment or proficiency at the controls raise a
      question in the instructor’s mind as to the trainee’s ability to safely complete a prescribed
      maneuver at any time during the flight, the instructor will immediately assume aircraft
      control. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate proper tactics, techniques,
      and procedures for the maneuver prior to the trainee resuming control of the aircraft. All
      instructors will place special emphasis on procedures for positively identifying
      emergency conditions before initiating corrective action.
      5.4.5.5. Instructor Loadmasters (IL) are responsible for student supervision and safety
      regardless of rank. Should the judgment or proficiency of the trainee raise a question in
      the instructor’s mind as to the trainee’s ability to safely execute the duties of the aircrew
      position at any time during the flight, the instructor will immediately takeover those
      duties. The instructor should then explain and demonstrate the proper method of
      executing those duties prior to the trainee resuming duties. Use instructors for any phase
      of training to capitalize on their expertise and experience.
5.5. Flight Examiner Upgrade.
   5.5.1. Flight Examiners. Sq/CC will recommend instructors for flight examiner certification.
   Instructors identified for certification as a flight examiner will possess superior knowledge of
   training and evaluation policies and procedures and the ability to administer evaluations
   according to applicable publications.

     on a nuclear mission or on a nuclear training mission while under the supervision of a
     current and qualified PNAF instructor counterpart.
     5.6.4.10. Flying Continuation Training. See Table 4.4 and Table 4.5.
  5.6.5. Phoenix Banner, Silver, and Copper Certification. Sq/CCs will identify their most
  highly qualified crewmembers for entry into certification training. Training will focus on the
  unique circumstances that differentiate this mission from other mobility missions.
     5.6.5.1. Units will establish and maintain Phoenix Banner training programs. As a
     minimum, training will consist of an instructor-led in-depth review of AFI 11-289,
     Phoenix Banner, Silver, and Copper Operation, discussion of tasking and execution
     agencies for Phoenix Banner missions, and how the aircrew will interface with these
     agencies. Furthermore, the program will address the personnel to coordinate with, in case
     of diversion or delay, including the Presidential Advance Agent, US Secret Service, and
     HMX-1 representative. The goal of training is to educate crewmembers on the
     requirements for these individuals/agencies and illustrate their ability to help accomplish
     the mission. Following the review, an open book examination of AFI 11-289, corrected
     to 100 percent, will be accomplished. Before commanding a Phoenix Banner, Silver, or
     Copper mission, aircraft commanders require squadron commander certification IAW
     AFI 11-289.
  5.6.6. Operation Deep Freeze (ODF). ODF is the Department of Defense (DOD) inter/intra-
  theater air and surface logistical support of the United States Antarctic Program (USAP). It
  involves the deployment and redeployment of scientific and support personnel, resupply of
  South Pole Station, McMurdo Station, and numerous deep field research camps established
  by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of Polar Programs (OPP).
     5.6.6.1. The C-17 Aircrew Antarctic Training Program exists because of the special
     requirements and procedures necessary for the safe and effective execution of Antarctic
     airlift operations. Sq/CCs will identify their most highly qualified crewmembers for
     entry into ODF certification training. At a minimum, experienced Aircraft Commanders
     and Loadmasters should be selected. For WINFLY, each aircrew member will be
     Instructor or Evaluator qualified. C-17 aircrews employ WINFLY procedures for
     Antarctic flight operations between March and September.
     5.6.6.2. Complete the certification training program using the 62/446 OG ODF C-17
     Antarctic Training and Certification guide and syllabus. ODF pilot and loadmaster
     Airland, Airdrop, and NVG operations each require a separate one-time certification
     (there is no NVG certification for loadmasters). Once certified for these events, currency
     is valid for three ODF seasons. If a pilot becomes non-current for an ODF event, the
     pilot will act as PF or PM under direct supervision of an ODF Instructor Pilot to regain
     currency. Non-current Loadmasters must be under the supervision of an ODF Instructor
     Loadmaster. WINFLY is a separate one-time certification, though completing any ODF
     event will satisfy currency requirements.

6.1. Description. The C-17 ATS is a civilian contractor-provided aircrew training system. The
ATS contractor provides academic and simulator training. The Air Force conducts all flight
training and administers all evaluations. The ATS contract guarantees trained students meet
government standards. ATS courses are listed in Table 6.1.
6.1. (ALTUSAFB) Description. ATS Contractor Supported Training. Information concerning
contractor duties is subject to the current terms of the applicable contract. Discrepancies
between the applicable contract and any flying agency within the 97 OG will be brought to the
attention of 97 TRS/TRK (KC-135) or TRC (C-17).
6.2. Applicability. As defined in AFI 11-202v1.
   6.2.1. Purpose. The C-17 ATS is a system of academics, ATD sessions, and ground and
   flight training phases. This system provides qualification, upgrade, and continuation training
   to attain and maintain appropriate qualification for C-17 crewmembers and maintenance
   engine run technicians. The ATS contractor provides training courseware and all academic
   and ATD instruction. US Air Force provides all flight instruction.
   6.2.2. Goal. The goal of the ATS program is to optimize aircrew training through the
   integrated use of academics, ATD, and flightline C-17 aircraft instruction. The C-17 ATS by
   contract establishes performance requirements in the ATS Statement of Work (SOW) and
   system specification. The ATS Master Task Listing/Evaluation Standards Document
   (MTL/ESD), objective media analysis report (OMAR), and media selection syllabus report
   (MSSR) products (approved by HQ AMC/A3T) help define C-17 course content, standards,
   and media selected for each task and objective, respectively.
6.3. Dedicated Training Time. As defined in AFI 11-202v1.
   6.3.1. It is imperative that students complete training in a timely and uninterrupted manner.
   Students will enroll on a full-time basis. Unit commanders will relieve students of duties not
   directly related to training. EXCEPTION: Senior Officer Course (SOC) students may
   continue their normal duties as time permits.
6.4. ATS Course Prerequisites. ATS course prerequisites are listed in Table 5.1. Each ATS
course is designed and based on student prerequisites being met. Prerequisites may include a

approved syllabus
S-Secondary Method--Training conducted at a location not normally designated to train a
specific MAJCOM-approved syllabus

Notes:
1. Secondary method may incur additional cost to the government. Waiver requests require
a minimum of 90 days for HQ AMC/A3T to coordinate.
2. Previously qualified instructors who attended a MWS formal course may upgrade in-unit
without a waiver with OG/CC approval. See Chapter 5.
3. Split courses require MAJCOM waiver and coordination with AMC/A3TF. Initial
qualification flying training conducted in-unit is considered the secondary method. Split
courses may incur additional MAJCOM costs.
4. Course available for MOB (in-unit) use only. Not available at Altus.
5. Coordinate all in-unit SOC courses with AMC/A3T.
6.5. Lesson Objectives: Instructors and evaluators use lesson objectives as a reference
document to establish training and evaluation standards. The contractor developed lesson plans
are an integral part of the formal syllabus and outline course requirements.
6.6. Unsatisfactory Student Progress. If a student’s training progress is unsatisfactory, the
contractor will notify the government representative (wing training, operations officer, etc.).
Following review of the student’s record, the commander will determine whether to continue or
terminate training. Refer to AETCI 36-2205, Formal Aircrew Training Administration and
Management, the course syllabus, and local supplements for further guidance.
   6.6.1. The contractor will provide written feedback to the unit commander or training office
   for students who display substandard performance.
   6.6.2. Remediation Procedures. ATS contractor and Project Officer (PO) or Quality
   Assurance Representative (QAR) will receive prompt notification of failed flight evaluations
   culminating an ATS course. Local procedures will ensure notification is completed within
   24 hours of failure for local evaluations and within 24 hours after return to home station for
   off-station evaluations. Remediation subsequent to a failed flight evaluation may be the ATS

   contractor’s responsibility, Air Force’s responsibility, or a joint responsibility, depending on
   the nature of failure. In every case, close coordination is required to achieve maximum
   trainee progress. Direct contact with appropriate ATS instructor supervisor is encouraged. If
   an aircrew member is unable to achieve, progress, or maintain qualification level and
   requires remedial training, it shall be documented in TMS and/or on AF Form 8. Identified
   deficiencies shall be remediated by the contractor at no additional cost to the government and
   without displacing student throughput.
       6.6.2.1. Remediation Scheduling:
          6.6.2.1.1. When a trainee is required to return for remediation regarding deficient
          areas, the trainee’s unit, appropriate wing or group training office, and ATS training
          manager will coordinate training start and completion dates. Previously qualified
          crew members should be enrolled in the UNQXX course in TMS to document all
          remediation training.
          6.6.2.1.2. The ATS contractor will contact the trainee’s flight commander if a trainee
          is identified, during ATS contractor’s instruction, to need remediation or additional
          training. If the ATS contractor determines no further amount of remediation or
          additional instruction will result in the individual attaining required MTL or SOE
          proficiency level, the contractor will expeditiously inform trainee’s flight commander
          and wing or group training office verbally and follow-up in writing. The contractor
          shall retrain the student until deemed qualified by an Air Force evaluator or the
          student is eliminated by the cognizant Air Force authority. At minimum, the Air
          Force ATS PO/QAR will receive a courtesy copy of this documentation. The Air
          Force will review the ATS contractor’s documentation and recommendations
          regarding trainee performance. The Air Force will determine whether or not to
          continue any further training for that trainee, using ATS instruction, or otherwise
          terminate all training in accordance with AETCI 36-2205 and the course syllabus.
6.7. Courseware Changes. Changes to ATS courseware, including MTL and SOE, may be
proposed by any C-17 crewmember. Complete recommended change on ATS contractor’s
change proposal form and submit to the local PO/QAR. Change proposals will be sent through
wing or group training and ATS PO and QAR offices to Det 2/AMCAOS at Altus AFB. Det
2/AMCAOS will coordinate with the ATS contractor and the originator and will provide
feedback to reflect action taken. Contract proposal forms are available from ATS contractor
training manager at each site.
6.8. Scheduling:
   6.8.1. General. Each unit will submit annual simulator requests for local training to
   AMC/A3TA to ensure contractual requirements are met and total system simulator capacity
   is available. Local procedures will be developed at each MOB for scheduling ATS trainees.
   MOB wing or group training offices will ensure procedures minimize schedule changes and
   turbulence.
   6.8.2. Training throughput. Annual throughput for specific ATS courses is established in the
   ATS contract. The AETC PFT document reflects formal school throughput based on Air
   Force requirements and what is authorized by contract. If the contract throughput for any
   MOB (formal school or otherwise) will be exceeded, HQ AMC/A3T will coordinate those
AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012                                                    59


  requirements through appropriate Air Force and ATS contractor channels. In conjunction
  with their PO or QAR office, wing or group training offices will monitor annual throughput
  (current or projected) according to their MOB ATS authorized throughput and notify HQ
  AMC/A3T of differences either above or below what is authorized in the contract.
     6.8.2.1. The ATS contractor establishes class sizes for individual courses. Every attempt
     will be made by MOB wing or group training office to ensure all classes are filled before
     requesting secondary method. ATS may accommodate less than full classes on a case-
     by-case basis when class is needed to obtain MR status.
     6.8.2.2. ATS training at alternate sites. The ATS contractor determines the required
     number of ATS instructors and resources needed to accommodate annual throughput.
     Projected annual throughput is based on Air Force manpower data, which includes
     assigned, on-loan, and attached active duty as well as designated ARC and other units
     specified to be trained at that MOB. Trainee scheduling at a particular MOB should be
     kept within the units designated for that MOB. If a unit is unable to complete their
     requirements at a designated site, units may receive training at another site with prior
     coordination between the unit, the site and AMC/A3T.
  6.8.3. Cancellations. Deletions from the ATS schedule will vary at each training site
  because of training courses offered and the impact to scheduling. Continued cancellations
  will greatly impact the overall annual training plan, and the contractor may be unable to
  accommodate the original, planned throughput.
     6.8.3.1. Simulator lessons will be canceled or changed no later than 1200 hours the day
     prior to the scheduled lesson. Cancellation procedures will be developed at each MOB
     between the ATS contractor and wing training.
  6.8.4. Air Force Time. The ATS contractor is required to provide Air Force usage time on
  training equipment at each site. The amount of time varies by site. This time is not
  normally used for aircrew training. By contract, it is controlled by AMC and is intended
  for safety of flight research, testing, procedures development, VIP tours, SIMCERT and
  other needs as directed by AMC. Use of any left-over time is at the discretion of the OG/CC,
  and will be coordinated through wing or group-level training offices. When scheduled, the
  training device will be fully operational and manned with an operator.
  6.8.5. ATS Course Pre-Work. ATS courses may require trainee preparation before class
  start. The pre-work is an integral portion of the course and will be accomplished to receive
  course completion credit. Pre-work may consist of reviewing study references, quizzes,
  performance data preparation, workbooks, etc. Required pre-work is described in the
  appropriate student training guide. When required, ATS contractor will ensure student
  training guides and workbooks are distributed to units in time for pre-work completion.
  6.8.6. Late or No-Show. Course completion credit may be withheld when trainee tardiness
  interferes with class training. For WST, cockpit systems simulator (CSS), and loadmaster
  simulator (LS) sessions, tardiness is defined as 15 minutes after mission briefing time. Those
  classes, which cannot be conducted without the late trainee’s presence, will be canceled at
  the 30-minute point (e.g., a WST session with pilot no-show will be canceled if the mission
  cannot be effectively conducted). While ATS contractor personnel are not required to
 60                                   AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012


   substitute for missing or late crewmembers, contractor personnel may fill a crew position per
   existing contractor/government agreements.
   6.8.7. Virtual Flag/DMO exercises. Virtual Flag (VF) is a CSAF directed exercise that
   incorporates aircrew participants in flight simulators, DoD forces in the field, and computer
   generated participants in a Distributed Mission Operation (DMO) environment (Virtual Flag
   is comparable to Red Flag, Green Flag, and Maple Flag exercises). Unit participation and
   planning for VF/DMO exercises is essential. Participating units provide tactics/mission
   planners to employ tactics, techniques, and procedures and conduct unit-level mission
   planning requirements. Units will schedule an entire aircrew (aircraft commander, pilot, and
   loadmaster) for each Virtual Flag mission. Aircrews may be required to conduct mission
   planning prior to the exercise. Loadmasters may participate in the linked Loadmaster
   Simulator (LS) and/or in the Aircraft Vehicle Simulator (AVS). Aircrew members may
   credit day two of quarterly phase simulator training upon completion of a successful Virtual
   Flag (or similar JCS/MAJCOM-directed) exercise with OG/CC approval.
   6.8.8. Distributed Mission Training (DMT). DMT links local or long-distance flight
   simulators for continuation training purposes and provides realistic single ship, airdrop
   formation, and air refueling procedures training.
6.9. Administration:
   6.9.1. ATS Feedback
       6.9.1.1. Air Force-appointed ATS Project Officer and/or Quality Assurance
       Representatives (PO/QAR) are primary focal points and the liaison agency between the
       Air Force and the ATS contractor. POs and/or QARs are the only Air Force personnel
       empowered to evaluate any component of contract compliance. These individuals are
       entrusted with quality assurance, are the only appropriate office (unit-level) to direct
       contractor to perform or stop work via the contracting officer’s direction, and are
       accountable for these actions. Each wing or group commander will establish ATS PO
       and QAR positions and enforce directives, requirements, and procedures established by
       DoD and MAJCOM directives and publications. ATS POs and QARs will maintain a
       current copy of the ATS contract(s), designated quality assurance regulations and
       directives, and quality assurance procedures. Local PO/QARs will provide feedback on
       C-17 ATS performance and contract compliance to Det 2, AMCAOS. Provide a courtesy
       copy of all monthly Contract Performance Assessment Report (CPAR) reports and
       corrective action requests to Det 2, AMCAOS.
       6.9.1.2. Operational Evaluation. The ATS contractor is required to evaluate the ATS
       program and its graduates’ on-the-job performance. The objective of this ongoing
       ―operational evaluation‖ is to assure the ATS produces qualified graduates. The
       contractor’s system will ensure a steady flow of information to maintain quality,
       effectiveness, and currency in the ATS. Revisions to the ATS will be based on this
       information.
6.10. Training Implementation/Student Expectations. Students will review the student
schedule and needed courses section of TMS to ensure compliance with training requirements.
Students are expected to review their instructor’s comments and to complete pre-requisite
training in a timely manner. Formal school students will ensure all pre-requisite CBT lessons are
AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012                                                      61


completed prior to simulator or training device lessons. Failure to complete pre-requisite lessons
may result in a failing grade for a simulator or training device lesson and subsequent course
removal. See AETC formal school syllabus for pre-requisite requirements and further guidance.
6.11. Browsing Training Products. C-17 crewmembers and engine-run personnel are
encouraged to browse any and all lessons existing within the ATS. This is particularly applicable
to those personnel preparing to enter upgrade courses, subject to the following restrictions:
   6.11.1. Browser time is on a space-available basis.
   6.11.2. All browser requests will be coordinated with the ATS training supervisor.
   6.11.3. Trainees are not to be scheduled to browse lessons for remediation. Remediation will
   be scheduled by coordinating with the ATS contractor. Browsing a lesson does not enable the
   trainee to take the end-of-lesson test. Trainees in remediation will be enrolled in lessons for
   review in order to take the end-of-lesson test and keep a permanent record of the remediation.
6.12. Aircraft Flights for ATS Training Instructors.
   6.12.1. The ATS contractor provides opportunity for Air Force flight instructors to observe
   trainee progress in ATDs. Likewise, the terms and conditions of the current government
   contract allow ATS instructors to observe the trainee's aircraft flights. In some cases, ATS
   courseware may state these specific occurrences. Every reasonable effort should be made to
   ensure this type of interface continues at each training site.
   6.12.2. Contractor Personnel Flight Operations. ATS Contractors may fly on a non-
   interference basis aboard USAF aircraft IAW the terms and provisions of the current
   government contract, as provided for in AFI 11-401.
6.13. ATS Facility Tours:
   6.13.1. Wing training offices will coordinate all requests for C-17 ATS facility tours with the
   contractor as soon as possible, but in no case later than 24 hours prior to the planned event.
   This may require close coordination with public affairs and protocol. AF time may be used
   at the discretion of the OG/CC. Tours will be on an as-available basis and will not displace
   scheduled training events.
   6.13.2. OG/CC will ensure an Air Force representative meets, greets, accompanies, and
   conducts all tours. The contractor is not manned for or on contract to perform these duties.
   The contractor shall be responsible for providing an aircrew training device operator only.

AD10 I-CDS/JPADS Airdrop
Purpose: Continuation training for I-CDS/JPADS certified loadmasters.
Description: I-CDS/JPADS airdrop to include flight station and cargo compartment
configuration JPADS checklists, and I-CDS or JPADS airdrop to an appropriate DZ.
Loadmasters who are only I-CDS certified (Q521) will load, rig, and drop an actual I-CDS
bundle. Loadmasters who are JPADS certified (Q522) will load and rig an actual JPADS guided
bundle. JPADS certified loadmasters (Q522) will drop either an actual JPADS guided bundle (if
desired/permitted), or will simulate a guided bundle drop by performing an in-flight wireless
update to the AGU and then dropping an actual I-CDS bundle instead.

For I-CDS drops, in the event that the dropsonde(s) was (were) deployed but insufficient
dropsonde data was gathered to update the release point with the PADS computer, the crew will
make all reasonable attempts to troubleshoot the problem, to include completion of the
I-CDS/JPADS troubleshooting guide. If these procedures fail to correct the problem, then at the
discretion of the aircraft commander, the event can still be considered complete if the crew
successfully airdrops the bundle by completing the I-CDS/JPADS to Conventional Quick
Transition Checklist, and performing a racetrack/re-attack using conventional ballistic CDS
procedures.

OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
Training Media: Aircraft or USAF-certified.
Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
Additional Information: If dropping an actual JPADS guided bundle is not practical, loadmasters
still require an AGU rigged on a bundle aboard the aircraft to simulate all necessary checklist
steps, and in-flight wireless update. Loadmasters may credit the event if all checklists through
the slowdown checklist are accomplished, and there is not a no-drop condition due to either
loadmaster. If a planned or unplanned no-drop condition occurs after the slow-down checklist is
completed, aircraft commanders will determine if enough training was accomplished to credit the
event. May dual log with AD04, and AD09 if all requirements of the events are met.

Purpose: Continuation training for PADS operator certified mission-ready pilots.
AFI11-2C-17V1_ALTUSAFBSUP_I 14 MARCH 2012                                                     65


Description: I-CDS (JPADS unguided) airdrop to include mission planning, JPADS computer
preflight and inflight actions, flight station and cargo compartment configuration, JPADS
checklists, sonde drop/monitoring, collateral damage evaluation, and I-CDS airdrop to an
appropriate DZ. Crews will comply with all requirements of AFI 13-217, Drop Zone and
Landing Zone Operations. The unguided system airdrop is considered complete with successful
deployment of the dropsonde(s), update of the release point via PADS computer and airdrop of
the bundle. There is no minimum altitude for this event when accomplished in the aircraft, other
than the minimum altitude to drop a sonde, though realistic AFTTP 3-3.C-17 altitudes should be
used to the maximum extent possible based on airspace and DZ restrictions.

For I-CDS drops, in the event that the dropsonde(s) was (were) deployed but insufficient
dropsonde data was gathered to update the release point with the PADS computer, the crew will
make all reasonable attempts to troubleshoot the problem, to include completion of the
I-CDS/JPADS troubleshooting guide. If these procedures fail to correct the problem, then at the
discretion of the aircraft commander, the event can still be considered complete if the crew
successfully airdrops the bundle by completing the I-CDS/JPADS to Conventional Quick
Transition Checklist, and performing a racetrack/re-attack using conventional ballistic CDS
procedures.

OPR: AMC/A3T/A3D
Training Media: Aircraft or USAF-certified WST.
Instructor: Not required for continuation training.
Additional Information: PADS Operators must perform all PADS duties to credit the event.
PADS operators may not log this event while occupying either pilot's seat. This event may be
accomplished in conjunction with a guided drop (e.g., after sonde drop, racetrack and update
both the guided solution and the unguided/I-CDS solution, perform wireless transfer to the AGU,
then turn inbound for an actual I-CDS drop). Pilot PADS operators may not log this event while
occupying either pilot's seat. May dual log with AD01, AD04, AD09 if all requirements of the
events are met. Event may be credited in the WST only if all the specified training requirements
listed within this section are completed.

airdrop is considered complete with update of the release point and launch acceptability region
using the JPADS computer (with or without sonde data), wireless transfer to the AGU, and
completion of all checklists through the slowdown checklist. Minimum altitudes for actual
guided airdrops are IAW specific requirements of each guided system and AFI 13-217. There is
no minimum altitude for simulated drops used in training, but realistic AFTTP 3-3.C-17 altitudes
should be used to the maximum extent possible based on airspace and DZ restrictions.

                       AIRCREW TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

A2.1. General Information. This attachment provides guidelines on proper training
documentation. The training management system (TMS) performs standardized training
documentation functions for all C-17 units. HQ AMC/A3TA and Det 2, AMCAOS at Altus
AFB are the POCs and liaison with the ATS contractor for TMS changes and recommendations.
Coordinate all recommended changes through MAJCOM to HQ AMC/A3TA and Det 2
AMCAOS.
   A2.1.1. TMS will be used for all formal training listed in the Air Force Education and
   Training Course Announcements database (either at formal school or in-unit), mission
   qualification, special qualification or in-unit upgrade program to the next higher crew
   qualification, including Mobility Pilot Development (MPD), requalification training (either at
   formal school or in-unit), or for any corrective action or additional training.
   A2.1.2. Web-based TMS provides world-wide access to instructors and supervisory
   personnel. Instructors, Aircraft Commanders, training office personnel, Ops Officers and
   Commanders may obtain access through the ATS contractor’s portal. Contact the local ATS
   contractor site manager for access.
   A2.1.3. The instructor or trainer will review TMS prior to all training periods. Those areas
   not previously accomplished or those, in which crewmembers require additional training,
   will be noted for possible inclusion during the current training period.
   A2.1.4. The commander or operations officer will review training progress via squadron
   training officer brief or TMS review at least once each calendar quarter (can count for
   monthly squadron training review) and prior to an evaluation for all crew members in
   training (EXCEPTION: continuation training). Squadron training representatives will
   conduct a monthly review of crew members in active training status. All reviews shall be
   annotated under ―Reviews‖ in TMS.
   A2.1.5. Records of crewmembers, not receiving training but in an active status for mission
   qualification, special qualification, in-unit upgrade, requalification training (i.e. extended
   DNIF), will be reviewed monthly and quarterly as indicated above. If applicable, the
   statement, "no training accomplished during this period," the reason why, and the projected
   date when training will resume will be entered in TMS. This statement is not required for
   crew members in continuation training.
   A2.1.6. TMS write-ups will be made for pre-aircraft commander and pre-instructor MPD
   pilots. At a minimum these write-ups will include any training in time control, air refueling,
   assault landings, and/or low levels.
A2.2. Unit training offices will ensure all training waivers are documented in TMS. Waivers
approved on the AMC waiver web-page are automatically forwarded to TMS and placed in the
crew members ―waiver‖ folder. However, unit training offices will ensure individual waivers are
recorded in TMS during required record reviews. Waivers not issued via the AMC waiver web
page will be cut-and-pasted into the individual’s waiver folder. Reference the waiver authority
and date authorized in lieu of a signature.

A2.3. TMS Checklists. The checklist feature of TMS allows MAF standardization of training
programs. It also allows units to add local requirements that need to be documented in the
individuals TMS record. AMC/A3TA will provide standard MAF checklists generic to all C-17
units. Unit checklists will not be used to replace or duplicate courses in TMS. However, units
may add locally developed checklists that are maintained by the unit level (OSS/OST) training
office. Review unit checklist periodically and update them as necessary. Delete unused or
unneeded checklists annually.
   A2.3.1. Ground training events accomplished at the formal school will be annotated on the
   MAF Standardized Ground Training Events Checklist in TMS. Gaining units will review
   each crew member’s ground training events checklist after arrival from the FTU. Events not
   accomplished at the FTU will be conducted by the gaining unit prior to completion of
   mission ready training.
