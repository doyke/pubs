                                                Chapter 1

                                               GENERAL

1.1. Disbursing Agent (DA). A disbursing agent is an agent of a Disbursing Officer (DO) or Deputy
Disbursing Officer (DDO). A DA normally operates an office geographically separated from the DO/
DDO’s office and is authorized to make voucher payments, voucher collections, appoint cashiers and cer-
tifying officers, and maintain funding documents (e.g., AF Form 616). Because of these duties, disbursing
agents should be familiar with accounts payable, disbursing, military pay, and travel pay. The DA may
also request the commander appoint local paying agents, change fund cashiers, and imprest fund cashiers.
After the commander receives the request from the DA or if the commander initiates the action for an
imprest fund cashier, the commander must notify the contacting office to provide oversight and training.
The DA tracks daily disbursement and collection voucher processing on a DD Form 2665, Daily Agent
Accountability Summary. Disbursing agents will not act as purchasing officers.
    1.1.1. Officers, enlisted members, or civilian employees may be appointed as a DA. To start the
    appointment process, the home station commander will coordinate with the DO/DDO. The DO/DDO
    will maintain the original appointment letter (refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 020602C). The let-
    ter will contain the name, SSN, and rank/grade of the agent; where the agent’s office will be located;
    description of duties; effective date of appointment; a statement the individual has been counseled on
    pecuniary liability and has been given written operating instructions. The agent acknowledges receipt
    of the appointment letter by signing the statement “I acknowledge that I am strictly liable to the
    United States for all public funds under my control”. If the individual is already a DDO, disbursing
    agent orders to not need to be issued.

1.2. Paying Agent (PA). A paying agent is an agent of a DO, DDO, or DA. Usually, a PA is appointed to
perform certain transactions for a specific period. Examples include: making cash military pay, travel pay,
prepaid vendor payments, or accommodation exchange transactions. However, a PA should not be
appointed over the protest of the DO or when the transaction can be accomplished by the DO, DDO, or
DA. Paying agents will not act as purchasing officers. Paying Agents will be issued funding documents
(e.g., AF Form 616).
    1.2.1. Officers, enlisted members, or civilian employees may be appointed as a PA. The commander
    will issue the appointment letter (refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 020604B). The letter will con-
    tain the name, rank/grade, SSN, duty station of the agent, where the agent’s office will be located, the
    Disbursing Station Symbol Number (DSSN) of the accountable DO/DDO/DA, a description of duties
    and type payments that will be made, maximum funds to be advanced, the duration of the appoint-
    ment, the effective date of appointment, and a statement that the individual has been counseled on
    pecuniary liability and has been given written operating instructions. The agent acknowledges receipt
    of the appointment letter by signed the statement “I acknowledge that I am strictly liable to the United
    States for all public funds under my control”.

1.3. Written Operating Instructions. We suggest you use this pamphlet as part of your written instruc-
tions. Additional instructions should be included with an appointment letter.
    1.3.1. Agent Turn-Ins. The agent’s operating instructions should state how often the agent is required
    to make a return to the DO. While returns must be made at least monthly (DoDFMR, Vol. 5, paragraph
    030401D), agents who provide check cashing services should consider making turn-ins on a more fre-
AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001                                                                      7


  quent (e.g., weekly) basis. Frequent turn-ins allow the DO/DDO to quickly deposit checks or other
  negotiable instruments cashed by the agent and reduces the “float time” and number of checks
  returned/dishonored for insufficient funds.

                                       PRIOR TO DEPARTURE

2.1. Initial Set-Up. Prior to deployment, the “supporting” MAJCOM and Base Level DA/PA should
attempt to find out as much information as possible about the deployment. Attachment 2 contains a
checklist that will aid in identifying needed information to ensure members are fully prepared prior to
departure. Attachment 3 contains a checklist for “supported” MAJCOMs to use as a guide to ensure they
are adequately prepared to answer the questions from the “supporting” MAJCOM and Base Level DA/
PAs. Also included herewith are “mini-logistics detail support (LOGDET)” list of pubs, supplies, and
forms. These can be found at Attachment 20, Attachment 21, and Attachment 22. In all instances, you
should work closely with your MAJCOM war planner.
    2.1.1. “Bare Base” Deployments. When deploying to a new area, certain additional questions need to
    be asked. These include:
       2.1.1.1. Is there an U.S. Treasury approved bank?
       2.1.1.2. Is there a place to store funds?
       2.1.1.3. Does the local economy accept credit cards or cash? If cash, do they accept local or U.S.
       currencies?
       2.1.1.4. Are there currency restrictions (denomination, etc.)?
       2.1.1.5. Is a weapon authorized at the deployed location? If a weapon is not authorized, what
       other security is available?
       The MAJCOM war planner should develop most of this information. You should work closely
       with this individual to ensure that you have all pertinent information. If the MAJCOM war planner
       is not available, you should contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate that represents the AOR for
       this information. Embassy phone numbers can be found in the Foreign Clearance Guide (FCG).
       An electronic version is available at http://www.fcg.pentagon.mil.
    2.1.2. Transportation. If the LOGDET is tasked and time allows, it must be transported to an Air
    Mobility Command (AMC) Aerial Point of Debarkation (APOD) in the most economical way possi-
    ble that will still accomplish the mission in the time available. Contact AMC for more information
    regarding aircraft into the theater. Based on the information obtained, it may be possible to use another
    command’s LOGDET. Due to security issues, you should avoid carrying excessive cash on commer-
    cial transportation.

2.2. Automated Battlefield System (ABS).
    2.2.1. Description. The Automated Battlefield System (ABS) was developed to meet the rapidly
    changing requirements Financial Managers must face in a deployed environment. ABS uses commer-
    cial-off-the-shelf hardware/software and a variety of communication modes/protocols. ABS provides
    the deployed Financial Manager the capability to accomplish on-line military pay inquiry support to
    Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force active duty personnel as well as Air Force Reserves. ABS also
    allows you to process commitment and obligation transactions on-line to the Base Level General
    Accounting and Finance System. Now you can provide real-time financial support to the deployed
    forces.
AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001                                                                             9


  2.2.2. SAF/FM Direction. As outlined in the 1998 Mid-Range plan under Support Contingency Oper-
  ations, ABS is deployed as standard equipment in every contingency deployment. Its use confirms
  better customer service with fewer people required at the contingency location. Ensure each
  UTC-tasked base has an ABS system in their logistics detail (LOGDET) kit.
  2.2.3. Available Information. Located on the HQ Air Combat Command Financial Management web
  page (https://wwwmil.acc.af.mil/fm/fmf/fmfos/abs/abs/htm) is all of the necessary information
  relating to ABS. You can access software applications, operating instructions, and links to applicable
  Internet sites using your web browser. The Air Force also has a technical help desk to resolve any
  issues involving ABS positioned at HQ Air Combat Command Financial Management.
  2.2.4. Pre-Deployment Responsibilities. Prior to the notification of a deployment, a copy of the ABS
  Operating Instructions should be downloaded from the HQ ACC web page. This OI should be incor-
  porated into the local training program to assist in preparing agents for deployment. Each individual
  should have the opportunity to use the OI to accomplish the tasks outlined on an actual ABS unit. A
  remote access service (RAS) account should be established at each permanent duty location. The RAS
  is designed for dial-in connectivity and should be used for both training and actual deployments when
  there is no communications support.
     2.2.4.1. Once notified of a deployment, the agent must obtain user IDs and passwords for both the
     Air Force and Army military pay systems from the security manager in military pay. Also, the
     agent must obtain terminal IDs, user IDs, and passwords for accessing the BQ system from the
     applicable Accounting Liaison Office (ALO). Finally, the applicable ALO must provide informa-
     tion on the funding status and an Address Directory for processing commitments and obligations.
     2.2.4.2. Upon notification of deployment, the agent should contact the home station or MAJCOM
     planners as appropriate and attempt to determine what communications support will be available
     at the deployed location. The agent also ensures that his/her communications requirements for the
     ABS have been identified.
  2.2.5. Areas of Interest while Deployed. Upon arrival at the deployed location, the agent verifies what
  communications support is available. If there is a communication representative, that individual
  advises the agent if a deployed local area network (LAN) is/will be functional. The communications
  representative will also provide the information necessary to access the LAN and any technical assis-
  tance required. If the LAN is not yet active or will not be activated, the agent will then locate a com-
  mercial telephone. If austere conditions exist at the deployed site, and commercial telephones are not
  available, then the agent is authorized to take the necessary steps (e.g., purchase cell phone or other
  satellite wireless communications) to establish connectivity via the RAS account. Once connectivity
  is established, the agent will begin daily processing into BQ, have the capability to extract reports
  (Paper View, WinBAS 95 or Louis Link) and process inquiries into the Defense Joint Military Pay
  System (DJMS) for Air Force and Army personnel.

   3.3.8. Legal/Claims Officer.

3.4. Discussion Topics.
   3.4.1. Deployed Commander. Establish office location, hours of operation, and business day hours.
   The DA should advise the commander on partial payments (approved authority, if any), check cashing
   (limits), and foreign currency sales policies. Determine if you have additional duties assigned. If there
   is a conflict between your agent duties and your additional duties, discuss this with the commander.
   3.4.2. Coordinate with security forces on duress alarm response and authorization code procedures,
   procedures to transport funds on/off the site, and if necessary, resource protection plans, escort proce-
   dures, storage facilities, and anti-robbery procedures.
   3.4.3. Coordinate your cash requirements with the funds source/banking institution. Find out if they
   will accept wire transfers and EFTs, their cashier hours, how much advance notice is required to
   obtain U.S. or foreign currency; if they can give you a U.S. dollar check for unused U.S. currency; and
   if they can buy back unused foreign currency (bills and coins or bills only). Determine if they can
   make vendor payments for you, current exchange rates and how often rates change. Lastly, determine
   if there are fees for check cashing, wire transfers, EFTs, purchasing foreign currency, exchanging for-
   eign currency for U.S. currency, or for making vendor payments.
   3.4.4. Coordinate with transportation on the availability of a vehicle.

                                                Chapter 4

                                 FUNDS SECURITY INFORMATION

4.1. Work Area. Signs must be posted within your cashier and office area stating “AUTHORIZED PER-
SONNEL ONLY” as specified in DoDFMR Volume 5, paragraph 030302B4.

4.2. Safes. Make sure your safe is accessible to only you. Safeguard your funds in accordance with AFI
31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, Chapter 25, Protecting Funds and DoDFMR Vol. 5,
paragraph 030302B1 through 18. You must change the combination upon: relief, transfer, or discharge of
anyone knowing the combination; appointment of a new cashier or agent; installation of new vault or safe;
at least every six months; or other times as circumstances warrant. If it is impractical to comply with the
above references, a one-drawer safe may be used, per Defense Cash Management Office (DCMO).
   4.2.1. For ease of operations, prepare your SF 700, Security Container Information, and SF 702,
   Security Container Check Sheet at home station, but do not set your combinations until you arrive at
   the deployed site. Have your accountable DO/DDO store your SF 700, in their safe. If something
   should happen to you at the deployed site, your accountable DO/DDO can provide your alternate the
   safe combination. This is not a regulatory requirement, however it could prove useful in an emer-
   gency. If these actions are not completed prior to departure, the deployed commander or security
   officer can store your combination (DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 030302B13).
   4.2.2. The amount of currency/negotiable instruments you need to store will determine what type of
   safe you use. Generally, the safe must meet General Services Administration (GSA) specifications or
   be certified as an “Underwriter’s Listed device”. If it weighs less than 500 pounds, secure it to prevent
   it from being easily removed. If space permits, weights can also be added inside the safe to reach the
   500-pound requirement (refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraphs 030304 and 030305).
   4.2.3. You must store cash (U.S. and foreign); uncashed prepositioned Treasury checks; cashed
   checks; accountability records; and original payment and collection vouchers in the safe. Do not store
   classified material with funds (this may be waived by the deployed commander in an emergency) or
   put anyone’s personal funds in the safe.

4.3. Safety Deposit Box Rental. Rent a safety deposit box when no other safeguarding means are avail-
able. Before renting a safety deposit box, get approval from your accountable DO/DDO. In addition, you
must contact the security forces to ensure security requirements are met; read the rental agreement care-
fully to ensure the contents of the box cannot be impounded by the host government; and make sure you
maintain possession of the key at all times. The Contingency Contracting Officer (CCO) can pay for the
rental with the IMPAC card, or charge your AF Form 616, by using a SF 1034 to pay for the rental
charges.

4.4. Safeguarding Funds in Hotel Safes. There may be times when other security methods are not
available and your only option is to store funds in a hotel safe. Coordinate security requirements with the
security forces and find out hours of access, limitations, and restrictions. Get a signed receipt each time
your storage container is locked in the safe. Normally, a hotel manager does not need to know the contents
of a locked container; however, it is possible you may to list the contents or place a value on them. Lastly,
find out if there are any charges for using the hotel safe. Again, the CCO can pay for the rental with the
IMPAC card, or charge your AF Form 616 by using a SF 1034 for payment.
14                                                                 AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001


4.5. Funds Escort Procedures. (Ref AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program, Chapter
25, Protecting Funds). Escorts may be armed or unarmed, depending on local conditions and laws. The
Chief, Security Forces, should establish the escort dollar limits. The final determination is based on the
amount being transported, threat, geographic location, distance, and route. Generally, an amount up to
$7,500 does not require a security forces escort. When funds are escorted regularly, vary the route and
time of movement. Escorts must not help carry the funds containers. During security forces escort, radio
contact must be maintained with the Law Enforcement Desk. Escorts must call the security forces imme-
diately before their departure, giving time and place of departure, route of travel, destination, and esti-
mated time of arrival. Security forces must also be notified when the escorts reach their destination.
Movement of funds off base should be closely coordinated with the civil police.

4.6. Protection of Funds under Field Conditions. Under no circumstances will government funds be
left unprotected. Deploy with the minimum amount of funds necessary and make frequent deposits to rear
area storage facilities (banks, finance offices, vaults, etc.). Deployed commanders will determine security
requirements. Wherever possible, the guidelines in DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 030304 will be followed.
However, where this is not practicable, MAJCOM commanders will establish procedures and guidelines
for their Commands.
AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001                                                                              15


                                                Chapter 5

                                    EMERGENCY OPERATIONS

5.1. Robbery. The security forces should periodically schedule anti-robbery exercises. This will test both
the security forces response time and your reaction. Whether an exercise or an actual robbery, you should
comply with the robber’s request and try to give the robber marked bills.
   5.1.1. After the robber has left the area, notify your fellow co-workers. They should secure the cash-
   ier area and all entrances, allowing no one to enter or exit (except security forces personnel). Segre-
   gate witnesses for later questioning and try to observe the direction the robber fled.
   5.1.2. Activate the duress alarm (if available) and contact the security forces. Do not break contact
   (phone, walkie-talkie, etc.) until they tell you. In addition, complete an AF Form 439, Robbery Check-
   list.

5.2. Agent Killed/Injured. In most instances this should not disrupt operations. The deputy DA can
obtain the safe combination from either the deployed commander or accountable DO/DDO. After the safe
verification requirements are completed, business is back to normal. If there is no deputy DA/PA, contact
the accountable DO/DDO immediately.

5.3. (DA only). Limited Operations. (Ref AFI 10-213, Comptroller Operations under Emergency Con-
ditions). When emergency conditions exist and there are overriding mission priorities, manpower short-
falls or imminent danger to life and property, normal operations may be suspended and the agent may
assume limited operations. The deployed commander will make the decision to assume limited opera-
tions. You will not take it upon yourself to stop normal operations unless you are cut off and the situation
has reached a point that clearly dictates you act immediately.
   5.3.1. Heavy emphasis will be placed on safeguarding resources. Once the order is given to limit
   operations, forward excess currency to your accountable DO/DDO. Generally, excess currency con-
   sists of coins and small bills. However, ensure you maintain sufficient currency for mission require-
   ments. Also, forward original disbursement and collection vouchers to your accountable DO/DDO
   using a DD Form 2666, Transmittal of Statements and Vouchers, and DD Form 1081, Statement of
   Agent Officer’s Account. Retain one copy of each. Throughout the limited operations, forward vouch-
   ers daily to your accountable DO/DDO. Ensure you use registered (uninsured) mail.

5.4. (DA only). Outside Agency Cash Turn-Ins. If conditions require an emergency turn-in of funds
from on-site activities, the commander or designee will instruct custodians of non-appropriated funds,
Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), and custodians of appropriated funds to transfer cur-
rency and coin to you.
   5.4.1. Ensure you maintain a current recall listing of all cash holding activities. In addition, provide
   each fund custodian training so they know what to do if a cash recall occurs. Providing them the
   appropriate forms in advance will speed up the cash recall process. If time is extremely limited, pro-
   cess the turn-in on a DD Form 634, Receipt for Miscellaneous Collections.
   5.4.2. For Military Banking Facilities (MBFs), appropriated and non-appropriated fund activity
   turn-ins (i.e., Clubs, AAFES), process a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, using suspense
   account 57X6875, Suspense, Department of the Air Force for all U.S. cash turn-ins (DoDFMR Vol. 5,
16                                                                    AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001


     paragraph 180202A, 180203A, and 180204A). Detailed instructions can be found in referenced para-
     graphs.
     5.4.3. For MBFs, non-appropriated and appropriated foreign currency turn-ins, issue a DD Form 634
     only. The receipt must state: “Neither the DO, DA, nor the U.S. Government will be held accountable
     should the currency/coin be lost.” (DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 180202B, 180203B, and 180204B).
     Detailed instructions can be found in referenced paragraphs.

5.5. Destruction of Funds. (Ref DoDFMR Vol. 5, Chapter 18 and AFI 10-213, Comptroller Operations
under Emergency Conditions, paragraph 4.3). Currency, coin, and other negotiable instruments (blank
checks, traveler’s checks, etc.) must be completely destroyed. Ensure you have a means to rapidly inven-
tory and destroy these items. Destroy the highest value items first. Destroy in the order of precedence
established in DODFMR, Vol. 5, paragraph 180102.
     5.5.1. There are several methods of destruction available. The preferred methods are: a sodium nitrate
     emergency destruction kit (M4 kit), a paper shredder, or an incendiary device. If burning is used, all
     paper items must be burned beyond recognition. Coins must be scattered in deep water, secretly bur-
     ied, or as an alternative, coins may be fused or mutilated in such a manner to make them unrecogniz-
     able as U.S. or foreign coins. You must make every effort to prevent currency/coins from falling into
     the wrong hands.
     5.5.2. If time permits, prepare a DD Form 2669, Destruction Schedule for Currency. Prepare separate
     certificates, in original and three copies, for U.S. currency, U.S. coin, foreign currency, foreign coins,
     and Military Payment Certificates (MPC). You will have to modify block 4 of the form for U.S. coins,
     foreign currency bills and coins, and MPCs. Do not convert foreign currency to its U.S. dollar equiv-
     alent. Your other supporting documentation will reflect the U.S. dollar value.
        5.5.2.1. U.S./Foreign currencies, and MPC certificates must be signed by the DA and three disin-
        terested officers, at least one of who is senior in rank to you. However, the arrival of a senior per-
        son must not unnecessarily delay destruction. If a senior person is not available, any disinterested
        officer, regardless of grade, may witness the destruction. Refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph
        180201A.
        5.5.2.2. For U.S. and foreign coins, the destruction certificate must be signed by you and wit-
        nessed by two disinterested officers or two senior NCOs (E-7 or above) or any combination of the
        above. The SNCOs do not have to be senior in rank to you. In addition, have the witnesses anno-
        tate their SSN in block 8 and provide all witnesses a copy of Attachment 17. Refer to DoDFMR
        Vol. 5, paragraph 180201B.
        5.5.2.3. For U.S. and foreign currency, send the original and two copies of the certificate along
        with copies of your DD Form 2665, Daily Agent Accountability Summary, and DD Form 2663,
        Foreign Currency Control Record, to DFAS-ADC/DE and your accountable DO/DDO. For MPCs
        send the original and two copies to the designated U.S. Army finance office and a copy to
        DFAS-ADC/DE along with a copy to your accountable DO/DDO. Ensure you retain a copy of all
        certificates.
     5.5.3. Necessary documentation for getting Treasury relief is:
        5.5.3.1. The destruction certificates.
AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001                                                                                17


      5.5.3.2. Current DD Form 2665. If time permits, the regular daily business will be ended and a
      final DD Form 2665 prepared. If time does not permit, the cashier will prepare an OF Form 1129,
      Cashier Reimbursement Voucher and/or Accountability Report, which will be attached to the prior
      day’s DD Form 2665.
      5.5.3.3. Form 2663, Foreign Currency Control Record, to support foreign currency certificates.

5.6. Inadvertent Wartime/Peacetime Destruction of Currency. Fragments must be inventoried by at
least three disinterested people and safeguarded the same as cash.
   5.6.1. Packaging Currency. Regardless of the condition of the currency, do not disturb the fragments
   more than is absolutely necessary. If the currency is brittle, pack it carefully in cotton without disturb-
   ing the fragments.
   5.6.2. Send the currency to: Department of the Treasury
                                   Bureau of Engraving and Printing

                                                 Chapter 6

                                          DAILY OPERATIONS

6.1. Accommodation Transactions. (Ref DoDFMR Vol. 5, Chapters 4 and 12). Accommodation trans-
actions are provided when satisfactory banking facilities do not exist. Accommodation transactions
include: regular accommodation exchanges (U.S. dollars exchanged for foreign currency); reverse
accommodation exchanges (foreign currency exchanged for U.S. dollars); and accommodation check
cashing (checks, money orders, etc., exchanged for U.S. dollars). The deployed site commander, in writ-
ing, will authorize the DA to conduct these services. Adequate controls must be established to prevent
violation of local restrictions. Anyone conducting these transactions must have proper identification. Reg-
ular and reverse accommodation exchanges will be discussed under foreign currency operations.

6.2. Authorized Personnel. Accommodation transactions may be provided to the following individuals:
active duty U.S. military members; civilian employees of the U.S. Government who are U.S. citizens; and
U.S. civilians employed by U.S. firms working in the deployed area. For additional information, refer to
DoDFMR Vol. 5., paragraph 040103 and 040104.

6.3. Accommodation Check Cashing. Check cashing services involve exchanging U.S. dollars for
checks, money orders, traveler’s checks, etc. The DA will coordinate with the deployment commander
and state, in writing, personal check cashing amount limitations.
     6.3.1. The agent may negotiate the following instruments: personal checks and drafts, U.S. Treasury
     checks, bank certified or cashier checks, money orders (postal, telephone, bank, express), traveler’s
     checks, and MPCs (if authorized in country). The above items must be drawn by the person presenting
     it. Under no circumstances will you negotiate an altered check. You may negotiate other instruments
     including third party instruments only when your operating instructions specifically authorize you to
     do so.
     6.3.2. All authorized military and appropriated fund civilian personnel who request check cashing
     privileges must consent, in writing, to immediate collection against their pay for the total of any dis-
     honored checks. Refer to the DoDFMR, Vol. 5, paragraph 040201E for procedures and options. The
     Treasury FMS Form 2762 can be used for this purpose.
     6.3.3. Ensure you maintain a detail record of all instruments you negotiate. You may photocopy/
     microfilm (both sides) of the instrument or maintain a manual log. If you maintain a manual log, it is
     best to list each instrument as it is received. Ensure each cashed check has the following information
     annotated: Name and SSN of the person cashing the item, military organization, duty address, and
     duty phone (refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraphs 050208 and 040105E).

6.4. Dishonored Checks. The accountable DO/DDO will return any bad checks that you negotiated as
an advance using DD Form 1081. Upon receipt of the DD Form 1081, contact the command section to
determine if the individual is still on site. If so, make collection in cash or by cashier’s check, traveler’s
checks, or U.S. Postal money order. Do not allow the individual to redeem a bad check with another per-
sonal check. Also, do not allow the individual to negotiate additional checks until the bad check(s) has
been fully redeemed. If the individual opts to redeem a bad check(s) by payroll deduction, do not allow
the individual to negotiate additional checks until you have verified that a payroll deduction in the full
AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001                                                                              19


amount of the bad check(s) has successfully processed against the individual’s pay. If they have departed,
return the dishonored check to your accountable DO/DDO as a turn in.

6.5. Foreign Currency Operations. The Treasury Department requires foreign currency be purchased
from a government source, if available, and at the best rate possible. MBFs are more convenient, but the
best rate rule still applies. Follow this prioritized list when getting foreign currency:
   6.5.1. U.S. Treasury sources.
   6.5.2. MBF.
   6.5.3. Another DoD disbursing officer.
   6.5.4. U.S. Embassy DO.
   6.5.5. Non-appropriated fund activity.
   6.5.6. Local source authorized by the local country to engage in foreign exchange transactions.
   6.5.7. Foreign currency may be used to make payments to vendors and accommodation exchange
   sales to authorized personnel.
   6.5.8. Maintain a certificate of purchase for all purchases regardless of the source. (Currently,
   DFAS-DE suggests you use an OF 1017-G, Journal Voucher, see Attachment 15).
   6.5.9. A separate DD Form 2663, Foreign Currency Control Record, must be maintained for each
   type foreign currency purchased. It is required you maintain a separate record for vendor payments
   and accommodation exchanges if the foreign currency is being carried at two different exchange rates.
   The reason for this will be further explained in paragraph 6.6. below.
   6.5.10. Do not acquire foreign currency prior to the time it is needed and attempt to avoid payment
   for the foreign currency until you receive it. If you must pay up-front, ensure you establish a
   Funds-In-Transit on your DD Form 2665, Daily Agent Accountability Summary.
   6.5.11. Some countries limit the amount of currency you can purchase at any given time from U.S.
   Government sources or local banks. U.S. Government sources or local banks can identify these limits
   for you. If this occurs, you may have to place limits on the amounts of foreign currency individuals
   can purchase. Be sure to keep enough foreign currency on hand to support operational contracting and
   to meet official business.

6.6. Exchange Rates. This area may at first appear complicated, but it is relatively straightforward. The
situation is governed by whether or not the country you are deployed to has a MBF, and if so, is the MBF
at a location at which you receive your foreign currency. If you are purchasing your foreign currency from
the MBF, you will usually need to have two pots of money; one pot to perform accommodation
exchanges/sales, the other to make official purchases. In this situation, you must keep the funds separated.
Vendor payments will be made at the official rate, and accommodation exchanges/sales will be made at
the same rate the MBF performs these transactions. If there is an in-country MBF that is not accessible to
you, or there is no in-country MBF at all, ALL transactions will be performed at the “Average Purchase
Rate” of your foreign currency. (DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 130402).

6.7. Revaluation of Foreign Currency and Gains/Losses. If you are deployed to a location with a
MBF, and you are procuring your foreign currency from the MBF, currency (both on-hand and in a LDA)
20                                                                   AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001


must be revalued when the exchange rate changes (see paragraph 6.7.1.). If you are deployed to a location
with an in-country MBF that is not accessible to you, or there is no in-country MBF at all, your local cur-
rency remains at the rate it was purchased at. When you purchase additional foreign currency, the remain-
ing currency is “averaged” with the new purchase. This will determine the new exchange rate (see
paragraph 6.7.3.). Every effort should be made to revalue/average foreign currency at the beginning of the
business day. This prevents the necessity of recording a gain or loss on each individual foreign currency
disbursement/collection conducted before the new rate is established.
     6.7.1. When computing the new value of foreign currency on-hand, divide the balance of foreign cur-
     rency by the new exchange rate. Example: At close of business yesterday you had 42,380 lira on hand
     at 630 to $1, or a value of $62.269 (3 decimal points) or $62.27. Upon starting business today, you dis-
     cover that the MBF rate has changed to 628 to $1. That same 42,380 lira, at today’s rate of 628 is
     worth $67.48. There was an increase in the value of the currency you are holding on-hand (you would
     do the exact same procedure for foreign currency held in a LDA account). This increase can be han-
     dled in two ways, either prepare a DD Form 1131 and collect the $.41 into the 576763 account on
     today’s business, or annotate it on line 6 of the DD Form 2665 and collect it in when you perform a
     turn-in. If there had been a net decrease in the value of your foreign currency, there are two ways that
     the loss can be accounted for, i.e., a SF Form 1034 on today’s business, or by recording on line 11 of
     the DD Form 2665, which you will absorb by preparing a voucher when you do a turn-in. Record
     revaluation gains/losses on DD Form 2663.
     6.7.2. Post both the revaluation gain/loss and the rounding gain/loss amount to the DD Form 2665,
     and the DD Form 2663. The gain or loss must be documented on either DD 1131 or SF 1034 to the
     appropriation Gains & Deficiencies on Exchange Transactions **6763, with a Certificate of Revalua-
     tion (refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 130401B and C).
     6.7.3. When computing the “average purchase rate” of foreign currency on –hand and in the LDA,
     use the following computation method: 56,565 lira on-hand at 630 is worth $89.79, 32444 lira in the
     LDA account at 630 is worth $51.50, total lira 89,009 worth $141.29. Now, purchase $100 worth of
     lira with an U.S. Treasury Check. The exchange rate today is 626. The $100 check nets an additional
     62,600 lira. To determine the “average exchange rate”, take the total lira (151,609) divided by the U.S.
     dollar value ($89.79+$51.50+$100.00) equals 628.32690 (5 decimal places per IC 97-10 to DoDFMR
     Vol. 5). There is no accommodation gain or loss or revaluation gain or loss. Remember, only revalue
     your currency when you procure additional currency. The official exchange rate is 628.32690 and will
     remain at that rate until you purchase additional foreign currency, even if the rate changes at the bank.
     6.7.4. Record the additional purchase of foreign currency on your DD Form 2663 as well as the new
     exchange rate value of your on-hand and LDA account balances. Complete a “Certificate of Average
     Purchase Rate” and attach to daily DD Form 2665.

6.8. Regular Accommodation Exchanges. In this type transaction, you are selling foreign currency to
authorized individuals. Your customers will exchange either U.S. dollars or U.S. dollar instruments for
local foreign currency. All sales will be accomplished at the daily accommodation rate.
     6.8.1. All sales will be posted to the DD Form 2664, Currency Exchange Record. As a minimum, use
     a separate DD Form 2664, for each type foreign currency sold and for each separate business day. In
     addition, cashiers must maintain their own DD Form 2664.
AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001                                                                                21


6.9. Reverse Accommodation Exchanges. Authority to make reverse accommodation exchanges is
determined by whether or not there is an in-country MBF under DoD contract. If there is an in-country
MBF accessible to the deployed contingent, you may not make reverse exchanges, nor can you make
reverse exchanges for members permanently assigned to the deployed country. If there is no in-country
MBF, make the reverse exchanges at the daily accommodation rate. You may refuse to conduct a reverse
exchange if there is reason to believe the requester is attempting to convert illegally acquired foreign cur-
rency through multiple reverse exchanges. Contact Security Forces or the Office of Special Investiga-
tions. Reverse accommodation exchanges may be limited to bills only (no coins accepted).
   6.9.1. All purchases will be posted to the DD Form 2664 clearly labeled “Reverse Conversions”. Like
   regular accommodation exchanges, use a separate DD Form 2664 for each type foreign currency and
   for each separate business day. In addition, each cashier must maintain his or her own DD Form 2664.

6.10. Rounding Gains/Losses. At the conclusion of the day, cashiers will total their DD Form 2664s.
Total both the U.S. dollar and foreign currency sales columns. Next divide the foreign currency column by
the accommodation exchange rate and compare this U.S. dollar amount to the total of the U.S. dollar col-
umn. It is usually at this point you will notice a rounding gain/loss.

6.11. Combined Quarterly Report of Foreign Currency. Quarterly, the DO will report the DA’s for-
eign currency activities to DFAS-DE. You may be called upon to provide supporting information to the
DO for his report.

6.12. (DA Only). Limited Depository (LD). (Refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, Chapter 14). There may be sit-
uations when you have difficulty obtaining foreign currency or vendor payments are too large for cash
payments. If this occurs, you may have to establish a limited depository account.
   6.12.1. Explanation of Terms:
       6.12.1.1. Limited Depository (LD): A U.S. or foreign commercial bank designated by the Secre-
       tary of the Treasury to receive deposits from DO/DDOs or DAs. The LD may also be referred to
       as designated depositories.
       6.12.1.2. Limited Depository Account (LDA): A foreign currency account in the name of the
       activity to which the DO is assigned, and maintained in a foreign bank, by a DO/DDO or DA. A
       LDA is DSSN specific, and therefore is always “owned” by the DO.
       6.12.1.3. LD Check: A check drawn form the official checking account of the DO/DDO or DA.
       6.12.1.4. Confirmed Deposit: A deposit for which a receipted deposit ticket has been received
       from the LD. The ticket must show the date on which the deposit was credited to the checking
       account.
   6.12.2. Disbursing agents outside the U.S. must request permission to establish a LDA. The follow-
   ing are steps that must be taken when requesting a LDA. (If a recent site survey has been conducted
   for the deployed location, much of the banking information may already be available):
       6.12.2.1. If the MBF can support the operation no further action or request is required.
       6.12.2.2. If not, solicit local banks to ascertain what services are available and the cost. After con-
       tract MBFs, preference will be given to American financial institutions unless a local bank’s
       arrangements is more advantageous to the U.S. Government. A statement from the selected bank
22                                                                 AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001


        stating that they will provide the services must be obtained. Any bank charges must be identified.
        Attach results to memorandum requesting approval for the LDA.
        6.12.2.3. If more than one currency is to be used this must be stated in the request. Approval by
        the Treasury is given for each currency.
        6.12.2.4. Approval to open a LDA will come from the U.S. Treasury, through the Defense
        Finance and Accounting Service, Disbursing and Cash Management Office.
        6.12.2.5. The memorandum from the DO must include:
                Name and address of bank
                Point of contact and phone number at bank
                Reason for establishing an account
                Type of currency/currencies that is/are to be used. (If U.S. dollars are needed, the bank
                must be collateralized)
                How payments are to be made (i.e., cash, check, wire transfer)
                Approximate amount of U.S. currency/foreign currency disbursements per month
                Average amount of cash, if any, to be retained in the bank overnight
                DSSN of the Disbursing Officer
        6.12.2.6. The request, plus attachments, will be forwarded through the servicing DDO. The DDO
        will forward the request through the servicing DFAS Field Site DO for endorsement, which will
        forward it through DFAS/DCMO to the Treasury.
     6.12.3. If a site survey has been performed for the deployed site, the survey can be a useful starting
     point for gathering banking information in the area.
     6.12.4. When a DA knows in advance that he or she is to be deployed, there is nothing to preclude
     said DA from starting the LDA approval process before deployment. This could be especially useful
     when a DA is replacing an existing DA serviced by a different DO. The same information used to get
     approval of the existing LDA could be used to request approval for the follow-on LDA.
     6.12.5. Minimum required services are ability to honor payments to payees in outlying areas, provide
     monthly bank statements, and accept Treasury requirement for a zero (or near zero) account balance.
     6.12.6. Confirmed deposits to the LDA do not reduce your accountability. Make deposits on the
     forms prescribed by the bank. You must abide by local policy concerning the taking of LDA checks
     outside the country. When prohibited, overprint checks with the words “NOT NEGOTIABLE OUT-
     SIDE OF (Specify the country)”.
     6.12.7. Service fees will be charged against your AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization, using a SF
     1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal.

6.13. (DA only). Statement of Designated Depository. At the end of each accounting month, and upon
closing the LDA account, you must send your accountable DO a signed original and duplicate of a SF
1149, Statement of Designated Depository Account. Refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 140902 for
detailed instructions.
AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001                                                                            23


6.14. (DA only). Closing the LDA. There are several situations that could cause you to close the
account and each has specific actions you must accomplish. Refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 1410 for
detailed instructions.

6.15. Control of Voucher Numbers. Use a DD Form 2666, Transmittal of Statements and Vouchers, to
control voucher numbers. This will save time in the long run. If you use a voucher log, you have the addi-
tional workload of also listing the vouchers on a DD Form 2666 prior to giving them to your accountable
DO. Note: Request accountable DO/DDO assign a special voucher series to each of its deployed agents;
this will allow the accountable DO/DDO to recognize each agents’ vouchers.
   6.15.1. Prepare a DD Form 2666 for all collections and disbursements by each PC and partial pay-
   ments to other branches of service. All voucher numbers must be accounted for.
   6.15.2. The prefix for each PC voucher number should differ from the DO’s prefix. Example, AP –
   Military Pay; AT – Travel Pay; AS – Accounts Payable; etc. Voucher number prefix will be provided
   by the appointing FSO.
   6.15.3. Each DD Form 2666 must show the:
       6.15.3.1. Agent’s voucher number.
       6.15.3.2. Payee’s Name.
       6.15.3.3. U.S. dollar amount.
       6.15.3.4. Foreign currency amount, if voucher is paid in foreign currency.
       6.15.3.5. Date paid.
       6.15.3.6. Contract or purchase order number, if applicable.

6.16. Military Pay Payments. The deployed commander should establish a partial payment policy. Use
the member’s Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) to compute the payment. If a LES is not available, the
table below may be used as a guide. This is only a guide. The deployed commander can establish any lim-
its appropriate to the deployment.


E1 – E3            =           $100.00


E4 – E6            =           $150.00


E7 – 03            =           $250.00


04 – above         =           $500.00

   6.16.1. If a member needs a payment due to non-receipt of paycheck (local payee), request message
   authority from the permanent duty station DO before making any payment. Advise the member that
   any payment received will be deducted from a future payday (normally within next two pay periods).
   6.16.2. Individual payments may be made using DD Form 1351-6, Multiple Payments List.
24                                                                    AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001


6.17. Military Pay Payments to Other Service Active Duty Personnel (Including Guard and
Reserve). Please refer to DFAS-DE Manual 7073-1, Chapter 77 for guidance.

6.18. Miscellaneous Military Pay Information.
     6.18.1. Confirmation of direct deposit amounts can be accomplished by using ABS to inquire the
     Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS), by phone, message, or GAO3 listing.
     6.18.2. Hardship Duty Pay is payable only in certain locations. See DoDFMR 7000.14-R, Vol. 7A,
     Chapter 17, and IC 11-99, for a listing of locations. It is payable to enlisted personnel only and the rate
     varies by grade.
     6.18.3. Family Separation Allowance-Type T (FSA-Type-T). Members with dependents and mem-
     bers married to military members who meet the requirements outlined in the DoDFMR, Vol. 7A,
     Chapter 27, and message R231300Z April 98, Subject: FSA Waivers, may be entitled to FSA-Type-T
     at the rates prescribed in paragraph 270104B or D, as applicable. Procedures for starting FSA-Type-T
     upon commencement of a TDY expected to exceed 30 days duration are contained in DFAS-DEM
     7073-1, paragraph 27-6.
     6.18.4. Imminent Danger/Hostile Fire Pay applies to only those locations listed in DoDFMR
     7000.14-R, Vol. 7A, Chapter 10, including all Interim Message Changes (IMCs). It is payable to all
     ranks and members need to be in the area for one day in order to receive the entitlement for the month.
     6.18.5. FY98 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Section 602, Reform of BAS changed
     the definition of field duty (this definition is used only in determining BAS entitlement, not per diem
     Ref 6.23) which, in turn changed BAS deduction requirements. Only those enlisted members partici-
     pating in maneuvers, war games, field exercises, or similar type operations in excess of 180 days will
     forfeit their BAS. BAS is retained for any deployment of 180 days or less. See DoDFMR 7000.14-R,
     Vol. 7A, Chapter 25, and IC 29-98 for additional guidance.

6.19. Travel Payments to Regular Air Force/Air National Guard/Air Force Reserve (Note: Pay-
ments should be made by home PDS). Advance per diem payments are based on the daily per diem
rate times the number of TDY days. Record the payments on a DD Form 1351-1, Travel Allowance Pay-
ment List, or DD Form 1351-6, Multiple Payments List. Use a DD Form 1351, Travel Voucher, as a cover
sheet. Immediately, after making payment, mail or fax a copy of each payment to the member’s servicing
FSO. In addition, notify their FSO by message.
     6.19.1. TDY personnel claim missed meals using an AF Form 2282, Statement of Adverse Effect –
     Use of Government Facilities. Before departing the site, members must have the form approved by the
     deployment commander.

6.20. Travel Payments to Other Service Personnel (Note: Payments should be made by home PDS).
Use a DD Form 1351 for making payments. For Navy and Marine personnel, endorse their original
orders. Unless authorized by the deployed commander, no travel advance is authorized when the esti-
mated costs are less than $50. Refer to DFAS-DE 7010.3-R, Travel Transactions at Base Level, Chapter
18 (Marine), 19 (Navy), and 20 (Army) for specific procedures.

6.21. Travel Payments to Allied Nation Members. Prior to making any payments, coordinate with
your accountable DO/DDO. Approval must first be obtained from DFAS-AYCFM/DE. If approval has
AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001                                                                                25


been obtained, payment will be made from your AF Form 616. Payment amounts are limited to $2,000
per person. At the time of payment, a receipt must be obtained from the individual. As a minimum, the
receipt must contain:
   6.21.1. Name, grade, signature, identification number, organization, and country of individual.
   6.21.2. Purpose of the advance.
   6.21.3. Type and amount of currency advanced.
   6.21.4. Rate of exchange per one U.S. dollar of the foreign currency at the time the advance is made.
   6.21.5. Equivalent amount of U.S. currency.
   6.21.6. Address of the settlement officer (so a billing document with receipts and supporting docu-
   mentation can be sent).
   Submit the paid advance voucher and the above documentation to the accountable DO/DDO on a sep-
   arate DD Form 2666.

6.22. DD Form 1588, Record of Travel Payments. A DD Form 1588 (or comparable form) will be
used to record all travel payments. Establish a record the first time an individual receives a travel advance/
accrual. Entries on the form should be complete enough to use in determining additional payments,
adjustments, and final settlements.

6.23. Field Conditions. The JFTR Appendix A defines field duty as “All duty by members serving with
troops participating in maneuvers, war games, field exercises, or similar types of operations, and
   6.23.1. The member is subsisted in a government mess or with an organization drawing field rations,
   and is provided government quarters or is quartered in accommodations normally associated with
   field exercises (everything normally covered by per diem is furnished without charge, except that
   officer members are required to pay for rations at the discounted meal rate (basic meal rate)), or
   6.23.2. Students are participating in survival training and forage for subsistence and improvise their
   own shelter..”
   6.23.3. Members furnished quarters and subsistence obtained by contract may also be considered as
   performing field duty when so declared by competent official.
   6.23.4. The change to the definition of field duty in the DoDFMR Vol. 7 is for use in determining the
   entitlement to Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) and has no effect on the non-entitlement to per
   diem.
   6.23.5. It is the responsibility of the senior commander in charge of the deployment to declare and
   determine the period of field duty. The senior commander is also responsible for determining how
   troops will be fed and billeted during the period of field duty. Although the field duty definition reads
   in part, “and is quartered in accommodations normally associated with field exercises,” this does not
   preclude the commander from providing troops with contract quarters or billeting at no charge. You
   should brief personnel about certificates needed to support payment of per diem for any period they
   were not under field conditions. This certificate must be signed by the senior commander (or desig-
   nee) in charge of the deployment and be in the following format: “I certify that from (date) through
   (date), (name/SSN) was not quartered/subsisted under field conditions.”
26                                                                  AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001


6.24. Managing an AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization. Be sure you know what can and cannot
be purchased. Payments for local goods and services may be for any number of things. Question the need
for the item and why it cannot be shipped. Some common authorized purchases are:
     6.24.1. Vehicle rentals for official business.
     6.24.2. Official newspaper subscriptions.
     6.24.3. Machine parts, paint, signs, photographic supplies/services, etc., for mission accomplishment.
     6.24.4. Billeting/accommodations.
     6.24.5. Insurance on rental vehicles when not included in rental agreement (only in overseas loca-
     tions).

6.25. Using a SF 44, Purchase Order – Invoice Number. This form may be used to purchase items
from local vendors during exercises or emergency conditions. The contracting officer should designate
the purchasing agent in writing. In addition, written instructions defining what may or may not be pur-
chased should also be included. However, the contracting officer is still responsible for the purchasing
agent’s actions. The SF 44 must clearly describe the service or commodity being procured (Ref AFFAR
Sup 5301.690). Do not use a SF 44 as a payment documents, but as an attachment to a SF 1034, Public
Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal. The small size of the SF 44 makes certification,
brief block, and other documentation requirements difficult (Ref DFAS-DE 7010-2.R, Commercial Trans-
actions at Base Level, paragraph 13-1a(1)). If the purchaser and seller blocks are signed, the other
back-up documentation requirements (receiving report and invoice) remain unchanged (Ref DFAS-DE
7010.2-R Chapter 14).
     6.25.1. The dollar limitation on a SF 44 is $2,500 for all purchases except for aviation fuel and oil
     purchases which will not exceed the small purchases limitation in FAR 13.000 ($25,000); and over-
     seas transactions by warranted contracting officers up to the small purchase limitation established by
     FAR 13.000 in support of contingencies declared by the Secretary of Defense.
     6.25.2. A funded SF 44 is subject to the same guidelines and fund availability as the AF Form 616,
     Fund Cite Authorization. Operations and Maintenance fund cites must be clearly shown on the SF 44
     and the AF Form 616 and advice number must be shown in the accounting data block.
     6.25.3. A stock fund funded SF 44 (i.e., diesel fuel) must meet the requisitioning criteria established
     by the Standard Base Supply System. The proper stock fund appropriation must be clearly shown on
     the SF 44.

6.26. Government Purchase Card. All participants in the Government Purchase Card Program (com-
monly known as IMPAC) must review the existing policy guidelines “USAF Internal Procedures for
International Merchant Purchase Authorization Card (IMPAC)”, set forth by SAF/AQC (to be published
as AFI 64-177). Procedures used during the contingency operation must be coordinated and approved by
FM and LGC. With the exception of the information contained in this section, all other Air Force Govern-
ment Purchase Card procedures apply to the use of the card for contingency operations.
     6.26.1. Warranted contingency contracting officers (CCO) are authorized to used the IMPAC in con-
     tingencies. A certified funding document (AF Form 4009, Government Purchase Card Funding Doc-
     ument) is required before purchase cards are requested. Accounts can be zero funded but must be
     assigned a specific base fund cite and corresponding master account code. When the CCO is notified
AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001                                                                               27


   to deploy an updated fund cite should be provided immediately. The original funding document will
   be updated with the new fund cite and dollar amount – master account code should remain the same.
   Adequate funding is required before using the card. The funding document shall be closely moni-
   tored by both the approving official and the finance representative and shall be reconciled at least
   monthly. The approving official is ultimately responsible for ensuring purchases are authorized in
   accordance with Air Force policy.
   6.26.2. The contracting and financial management officer must train cardholders on how to buy direct
   from the local vendor market. FM must provide joint local training to provide emphasis on ethics/pro-
   curement integrity, fiscal responsibility, and local business environment. Use may require cardholders
   to travel off base to make purchases or to meet vendors at the gate to accept deliveries. All participants
   must resolve Force Protection issues when initiating use of the card program. (Note: Unit cards cannot
   be brought from “home station” as they are linked to base funding documents and that bases’ account
   cannot be transferred.)

6.27. Using an AF Form 315, U.S. Air Force AV Fuels Invoice. (ref AFI 23-202, Buying Petroleum
Products, and Other Supplies and Services Off-Station, and DFAS-DE 7010.2-R, paragraph 21-46).
Authorized purchases are:
   a. Supplies and services in direct support of aircraft, motor vehicles, and boats when support cannot
      be obtained from U.S. Government sources (e.g., for emergency purchases);
   b. Items or services required for immediate use maintaining communications, electronics, or meteo-
      rological equipment (these type purchases are authorized when the deployment communication
      support or mobile team personnel cannot get the equipment from their supply base);
   c. Mechanical services, storage, civilian guards, etc. that are not within a reasonable distance of your
      site;
   d. And civilian guards or caretakers needed to protect an aircraft accident or forced landing site.
   6.27.1. For aviation fuels purchased from the host government charge the fuels Stock Fund Appropri-
   ation.
   6.27.2. For ground fuels, liquid oxygen, oil, etc. purchased from the host government charge your AF
   Form 616.
   6.27.3. The following personnel or their designees are authorized to make the above listed purchases:
       6.27.3.1. Aircraft commander.
       6.27.3.2. Motor vehicle operators and boat masters.
       6.27.3.3. Air Force Material Command depot area assistance maintenance team chiefs.
       6.27.3.4. Communication electronic and installation team chiefs.
       6.27.3.5. Mobile communications group deployment commanders or chiefs.

6.28. Foreign Currency Payment Vouchers. When making vendor payments show the net payment
amount in foreign currency units and the applicable exchange rate (refer to paragraph 6.6.). Ensure you
show the Foreign Currency Fluctuation Defense (FCFD) account if it is a designated currency listed in
28                                                          AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001


DFAS-DE 7010.1-R, General Accounting and Finance Systems at Base Level, paragraph 27-117. Vendor
payments should be individually listed on your DD Form 2663.

   by returning the completed duplicate DD Form 2666 to you. You must follow-up with the DO if the
   receipted copy of the transmittal is not received within a reasonable time.

7.3. Shipment of Turn-In Package. The preferred method of getting your package to your DO/DDO is
by returning it in person. However, if it cannot be returned in person, the vouchers should be shipped to
the DO/DDO by either registered (uninsured) mail or courier. (Refer to DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph
050501 for further information.)
30                                                                   AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001


     7.3.1. If sent by registered mail, keep the mail receipt and ensure the package is securely wrapped to
     meet land, sea, or air dispatch requirements. Send a message to your accountable DO/DDO indicating
     date and shipping method used.
     7.3.2. If sent by courier, ensure the package is securely wrapped. Have the courier sign the DD Form
     165 in the space beneath the block “Deliver Date and Hour” as a receipt for the package. Send a mes-
     sage to your accountable DO/DDO indicating date and shipping method used.

7.4. Losses and Overages of Funds. Your accountable DO/DDO and you determine if there are any
losses of funds. You are held jointly liable with your accountable DO/DDO for all funds entrusted to you.
You are also responsible for any erroneous payments or error in computation of vouchers.
     7.4.1. Cash shortages under $750 are processed IAW DoDFMR Vol., 5, paragraph 060404. Ensure
     you promptly record the loss on your DD Form 2667 and DD Form 2665. Send your accountable DO
     the investigation for the loss of funds. If the minor loss is under $300, the investigation can be signed
     by the primary DA. Under no circumstances shall the individual incurring the loss prepare his/her own
     investigatory report. If the loss is over $300, someone other than the DA or disbursing personnel shall
     be appointed by the deployed commander to conduct the investigation. Attach the report to your DD
     Form 1081.
     7.4.2. Upon discovery of a loss of cash in excess of $750, the loss of paid vouchers, or a loss of funds
     in shipment, a priority message stating the circumstances surrounding the loss must be forwarded
     immediately to your accountable DO with an information copy to your MAJCOM. Ensure you follow
     the directions set forth in DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 060303.
     7.4.3. Cash overages will not be used to offset losses. A DD Form 1131 will be processed to account
     for any overages. You will also maintain a DD Form 2667 to record these overages. The DD Form
     2667 will be submitted with your turn-in.
AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001                                                                                31


                                                 Chapter 8

                                 MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION

8.1. Funds Storage. The deployed commander may want other funds secured in your safe since you have
the only safe available. First attempt to identify other places for the money to be stored, such as a locking
file cabinet, hotel safe, or at the Security Forces central desk; if no other storage facility can be located,
store the other funds in a sealed container IAW DoDFMR Vol. 5, paragraph 270201.

8.2. Subsistence of Troops. Subsistence is funded from a Centrally Managed Account (CMA); do not
use your AF Form 616. Potable drinking water and ice are exceptions. If the medical authorities determine
bottled water must be purchased, costs are charged against your AF Form 616.
   8.2.1. Exceptions are made for contract feeding. Funding is as follows: if the contract pays for ser-
   vices only, pay for the services out of O&M and the food out of CMA; if the contract pay for food
   only, fund it out of CMA; if the contract pays for both services and food, fund the operation from your
   AF Form 616.

8.3. Medical Expenses. If no fixed hospital is at the deployed location, fund patient travel to the nearest
hospital using the below fund sites. Do not charge medical travel to your AF Form 616.
   a. Air Force: 97*0130.1833 2X* 43G1 B87502 B8 409 503700
   b. Army: This fund cite is based on the location of the deployed site. You will have to contact your
      MAJCOM to obtain the fund site.
   c. Navy/Marine: 97*0130 188M 000 00018 m060956 2D MEE000 00018599013E

8.4. Food and Forage Act. May be used as authority to make emergency purchases when your AF Form
616 has no funds left. Authorized emergency purchases are transportation, food, fuel, billeting, and med-
ical supplies. Ensure you prepare an after action report.

8.5. Commander’s Official Representation Funds (ORF). These funds are generally not authorized
for a deployed commander. However, funds can be delegated from the deployed commander’s com-
mander. Before the deployed commander obligates any funds they should consult their commander first.
These funds are available for funding certain items for visiting dignitaries (i.e., light refreshments at
receptions). Contact your AOR specific MAJCOM if in doubt and refer to AFI 65-603, Official Represen-
tation Funds-Guidance and Procedures.

8.6. Miscellaneous Situations. For situations listed below, advise your appointing FSO, and contact
accountable MAJCOM for guidance.
   a. Member had an accident in rental car involving local nationals.
   b. Drug related incidents.
   c. Black market dealing conviction.
   d. Vehicle rentals for recreational activities (trips, tours) and recreational supplies (balls, bats, swim-
      ming pools, etc.).
32                                                                  AFPAM65-110 10 OCTOBER 2001


     e. Legal claims payable to host government, foreign companies and citizens, other U.S. Government
        agencies, etc.
     f. Host government agreements for provided equipment, services, facilities will usually contain pro-
        cedures concerning payments.
     g. Goods and services needed to support aircraft accidents and related incidents not previously cov-
        ered under paragraph 6.25. and 6.26.

8.7. Emergency Leave. Deployed commanders may grant emergency leave if the member’s permanent
duty station is notified and agrees. However, approval is not necessary if it would result in an undue delay.
Transportation is normally limited to space required government transportation. Commercial transporta-
tion may be authorized only when government transportation is not reasonable available. When the mem-
ber’s Permanent Duty Station (PDS) is overseas, the cost of commercial transportation will not exceed the
cost of government procured transportation to the closest international airport in the Continental United
States (CONUS). When the member’s PDS is in the CONUS, transportation is authorized to the shorter
distance of either the PDS or the emergency leave destination.
     8.7.1. If the member will not return to the deployment site, return travel is charged to the original
     TDY order. If the member will be returning, fund the emergency leave orders from your AF Form
     616.
     8.7.2. Leave will be charged on an AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization (if the member
     returns to the TDY station) or the TDY travel voucher (if members return to the PDS).

chases, costs are charged against AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization.

food out of CMA.

2. If the contract pays for food only, fund it out of CMA.

3. If the contract pays for both services and food, fund the entire amount off your AF Form 616, Fund Cite
Authorization.

zation has no funds left.

nee must issue them a certificate. The statement must read: “I certify that during (date) through (date),
name/SSN was not quartered/subsisted under field conditions”.

6. Check Cashing Limits and Foreign Currency Sales

You set the limits for these two items. Ensure you consult with your finance agent concerning fund avail-
ability and suggested limits.

7. Partial Payments to Deployed Troops

Again, you set the limits for these. You decide on level of approval authority (i.e., none, first sergeant,
squadron commander, wing commander). Some suggested amounts are:

       E1 - E3 = $100.00; E4 - E6 = $150.00; E7 - 03 = $250.00; 04 - above = $500.00

submit it to the Secretary of Defense.
