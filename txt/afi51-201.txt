MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C
               MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs

FROM: HQ USAF/JA
      1420 Air Force Pentagon
      Washington, DC 20330-1420

SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice

       By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this is an Air Force Guidance Memorandum
immediately changing AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice. Compliance with this
Memorandum is mandatory. To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force
publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and
Forms Management.

       Current guidance in AFI 51-201 remains in effect with the following changes:

Change to para 4.1.2.2. Qualification of the IO. Unless precluded by military necessity or
other compelling circumstance, the IO should be senior in rank to the accused. An IO must be a
designated judge advocate. An IO may be a reserve judge advocate on active duty or performing
inactive duty training. ANG judge advocates must be on Title 10 orders to serve as an IO. The
accuser may not act as IO. The IO must be impartial. Before appointing an officer to serve as an
IO, the convening authority should consider the appointment in the context of the officer’s
normally assigned duties and assess whether the IO’s impartiality could be questioned based on
his/her relationship with the case, the parties, and the base legal office.

        (ADD New) 4.5.4. When drafting pretrial advice, SJAs should understand the difference
between a specification with litigation risk that is warranted by the evidence versus a
specification that is unwarranted by the evidence. The language "the specification is
unwarranted due to the lack of evidence" prohibits the Convening Authority from referring that
specification. SJAs should only use this language when advising the Convening Authority that
the specification cannot be directed to trial. See Art 34(a)(2), UCMJ.

        (ADD New) 4.7.4. For offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014, only GCMCA have
jurisdiction over the following alleged offenses:

              (ADD New) 4.7.4.1. Rape, in violation of Article 120;

              (ADD New) 4.7.4.2. Sexual assault, in violation of Article 120;

              (ADD New) 4.7.4.3. Forcible sodomy, in violation of Article 125; and
               (ADD New) 4.7.4.4. Attempts to commit the above offenses, in violation of
       Article 80.

(ADD New) Section 4E – Processing of Sexual Assault Allegations

(ADD New) 4.13. Secretary of Defense Withhold of Initial Disposition Authority. See
Figures 4.9 and 4.10. Effective 28 June 2012, the Secretary of Defense withheld initial

at least special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA) and who are not in the grade of O-
6 or higher, with respect to the following alleged offenses:

       4.13.1. Rape, in violation of Article 120;

       4.13.2. Sexual assault, in violation of Article 120;

(ADD New) 4.14. The withholding of initial disposition authority applies to all other alleged
offenses arising from or relating to the same incident(s), whether committed by the accused or

commander shall forward the case file, along with his/her written recommendation, to the initial
disposition authority. See Figure 4.9.

(ADD New) 4.15. The SPCMCA is responsible for taking an initial disposition action under
RCM 306. The SPCMCA’s initial disposition decision shall, at a minimum, be based upon
review of:

       4.15.1. Matters transmitted;

       4.15.2. Court-martial charges, if any;

       4.15.3. Any independent review and recommendation received; and

       4.15.4. Consultation with the Staff Judge Advocate.

(ADD New) 4.16. The factors in the discussion under RCM 306(b) may also be considered in
the SPCMCA’s initial disposition decision.

(ADD New) 4.17. General Court-Martial Convening Authority Review Policy. See Figures
4.11. and 4.12. Effective 17 June 2013, the Secretary of the Air Force directed that the
SPCMCA is required to provide the GCMCA in the grade of O-7 or above written notice of the
initial disposition action under RCM 306 within 30 days following the date of the initial
disposition decision, with respect to the following alleged offenses:
       (ADD New) 4.17.1. Rape, in violation of Article 120;

       (ADD New) 4.17.2. Sexual assault, in violation of Article 120;

       (ADD New) 4.17.3. Forcible sodomy, in violation of Article 125; and

       (ADD New) 4.17.4. Attempts to commit the above offenses, in violation of Article 80.

(ADD New) 4.20. Review of certain specifications not referred to court-martial following SJA
Recommendation of Referral for Trial. In any case involving specifications listed in paragraphs
4.19.1.-4.19.4. where an SJA recommends in Pretrial Advice under Article 34, UCMJ, to refer a
specification listed in paragraphs 4.19.1.-4.19.4., and the GCMCA decides not to refer a

to the next superior GCMCA for review. See Figure 4.14. Pretrial advice under Article 34,
UCMJ, is required if the specifications of these offenses have been forwarded up to the GCMCA

(ADD New) 8K – Use of AFLOA/JAJM Courts-martial Checklists
(ADD New) 8.23. When processing a court-martial, the use of AFLOA/JAJM courts-martial
checklists is mandatory. Location specific checklists are allowed as long as reviewed and
approved by AFLOA/JAJM.

Replace current paragraph 9.9 with the following:

9.9. Post-Trial Submission of Victim Impact Statements. In any case in which findings and
sentence have been adjudged for an offense that involved a victim, the victim shall be provided
an opportunity to submit matters for consideration by the convening authority or by another
person authorized to act under Article 60, UCMJ, before the convening authority or such other
person takes action.
       9.9.1. In this section, the term ‘victim’ means a person who has suffered a direct
physical, emotional, or pecuniary loss as a result of a commission of an offense under the UCMJ
of which the accused was found guilty and on which the convening authority is taking action
under RCM 1107. When a victim is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or
deceased, the term includes one of the following (in order of precedence): spouse, legal
guardian, parent, child, sibling, or similarly situated family member.
        9.9.2. Immediately following trial, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the trial counsel
or designee shall generate a letter to each victim, if any, of the accused’s result of trial. The trial
counsel or designee should personally serve this letter on the victim(s), or his or her Special
Victims’ Counsel if applicable, at the same time as the DD Form 2704, Victim/Witness
Certification and Election Concerning Prisoner Status. The SJA of the wing where the court-
martial occurred or the trial counsel signs the letter. This letter invites the victim(s) to provide
input, in the form of a written, signed victim impact statement, to the convening authority’s SJA,
as to whether or not the convening authority should approve the findings and sentence or grant
some form of clemency.
        9.9.3. The letter provides that the victim has 10 calendar days after the later of (A) if the
victim is entitled to a copy of the record of proceedings in accordance with paragraph 9.7., the
date on which the victim receives a copy of the record of proceedings or waives the right to
receive a copy of the record of proceedings; or (B) the date on which the recommendation of the
SJA is served on the victim. If there is a victim in a summary court-martial, the victim shall
submit the statement to the summary court-martial officer no later than 7 calendar days after the
sentence is announced. The letter also states the time and date by which the victim’s statement
must be received in order to be considered, that any statements will be provided to the accused
and defense as part of the post-trial process and that the defense will have an opportunity to
comment on it as a part of their post-trial submission to the convening authority. See Figure 9.2.
If a victim requests additional time for submission of matters, the convening authority or other
person taking action, for good cause, may extend the submission period for not more than an
additional 20 calendar days.
        9.9.4. Eligible victims may consult with a legal assistance attorney or Special Victims’
Counsel about the results of the court-martial and the post-trial process IAW AFI 51-504, Legal
Assistance, Notary, and Preventive Law Programs. The trial counsel or designee may explain
the post-trial process to victims IAW DD Form 2703, Post-Trial Information for Victims and
Witnesses of Crime.
        9.9.5. SJAs should not unreasonably delay providing the SJAR and post-trial paperwork
to the accused and defense counsel in order to try to locate a victim who is not readily available
or who chooses to provide a statement after the time and date set forth in the letter from the SJA
to the victim.
        9.9.6. Failure to submit a statement within the time prescribed shall be deemed a waiver
of the right to submit such a statement.
       9.9.7. Submission of a statement under this rule shall be deemed a waiver of the right to
submit an additional statement.
         9.9.8. A victim may expressly waive, in writing, the right to submit a statement. Once
filed, such waiver may not be revoked.
Change to para 9.16.3. The SJAR must include items required by RCM 1106 that are not
included on the personal data sheet or the Report of Result of Trial memorandum. This includes
a description of the character of the accused's service prior to the charges (RCM 1106(d)(3)(C)),
any clemency recommendations made by the sentencing authority (made in conjunction with the
announced sentence) (RCM 1106(d)(3)(B)), and any additional credit awarded by the military
judge for illegal pretrial confinement. The SJAR should also attach the victim impact statement
(if any), the maximum sentence for the guilty specifications/charges and a copy or summary of
the terms and conditions of any pretrial agreement, including a statement of any action the
convening authority is obligated to take under the agreement or a statement of the reasons why
the convening authority is not obligated to take specific action under the agreement. In addition,
the SJAR should contain a statement informing the convening authority what he/she cannot do
under the new Article 60(c), UCMJ, for offenses committed on or after 24 June 2014 per Fiscal
Year 2014 National Defense Authorization Act § 1702(b). See Figure 9.17. For cases that have
both pre 24 June 2014 and on or after 24 June 2014 offenses see paragraph 9.23. and Figure 9.18.
on how to address each offense in the SJAR. If trial counsel is recommending to the convening
authority that the accused be recognized for substantial assistance, put that memorandum as an
attachment of the SJAR. See paragraph 9.39. and Figure 9.19.
Replace current paragraph 9.23 with the following:
9.23. Convening Authority Discretion. The convening authority is not required to take any
action on the findings, to review the case for legal errors, or to review the case for factual
sufficiency. Action taken on the findings and sentence consistent with Article 60(c), UCMJ, and
paragraphs 9.23.1, 9.23.2. and 9.23.3. below, is a matter of command prerogative and within the
discretion of the convening authority.
        9.23.1. For offenses before 24 June 2014, Convening authorities may not substitute an
administrative discharge for an adjudged punitive discharge. However, in cases involving
relatively minor offenses, an accused with an outstanding combat record, or other exceptional
circumstances, and where restoration to duty is inappropriate, convening and reviewing
authorities may consider recommending to SecAF, administrative, rather than punitive,
separation under Article 74(b), UCMJ. Contact AFLOA/JAJR, 1500 West Perimeter Road, Ste
1170, Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington, MD 20762, for assistance and
coordination on such recommendations.

specification; or

                               9.23.2.1.1.2. Changing a finding of guilty to a charge or
specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a lesser included offense of the offense
stated in the charge or specification.

                       9.23.2.1.2. The convening authority may direct a rehearing in accordance
with sub-section (e) of RCM 1107.

                9.23.2.2. For offenses other than those listed in paragraph 9.23.2.1, for which the
maximum sentence of confinement that may be adjudged does not exceed two years without
regard to the jurisdictional limits of the court; and the sentence adjudged does not include
dismissal, a dishonorable discharge, bad-conduct discharge, or confinement for more than six
months.

                       9.23.2.2.1. The convening authority may change a finding of guilty to a
charge or specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a lesser included offense of
the offense stated in the charge or specification; or

                              9.23.2.2.2.1. Dismiss the specification and, if appropriate, the
charge, or
                               9.23.2.2.2.2. Direct a rehearing in accordance with subsection (e)
of RCM 1107.

                 9.23.2.3. If the convening authority acts to dismiss or change any charge or
specification for an offense, the convening authority shall provide, at the same time, a written
explanation of the reasons for such action. The written explanation shall be made a part of the
record of trial and action thereon.

       9.23.3. Action on the sentence for offense on or after 24 June 2014.

               9.23.3.1. In general. Unless authorized under paragraphs 9.39 or 9.40 of this
instruction, R.C.M. 1107 when amended, and Article 60(c), UCMJ:

include reduction in pay grade, forfeitures of pay and allowances, fines, reprimands, restrictions,

                9.23.3.2. If the convening authority acts to disapprove, commute, or suspend, in
whole or in part, the sentence of the court-martial for an offense, the convening authority shall
provide, at the same time, a written explanation of the reasons for such action. The written
explanation shall be made a part of the record of trial and action thereon.

Change to para 9.33. Contingent Confinement. Contingent confinement is confinement
authorized by a court-martial in the form of a fine-enforcement provision. See RCM 1003(b)(3)
and RCM 1113(e)(3). A fine enforcement provision may be ordered executed in accordance with
the procedures below.

               and Certification of Judge Advocates, to the Special Victim Capability. If upon
               appointment, an uncertified judge advocate is the only judge advocate assigned to
               the Special Victim Capability, he or she is required to consult with a Senior Trial
               Counsel (STC) or Special Victims Unit Senior Trial Counsel (SVU-STC)
               whenever practicable.

               13.37.2.2. At least one of the paralegals designated to the Special Victim
               Capability for each case should generally have completed the Paralegal Craftsman
               Course at the Air Force Judge Advocate General’s School.

       13.37.3. The SJA will designate a victim liaison to provide support to the victim through
       the Victim and Witness Assistance Program (VWAP) under Chapter 7. The SJA must
       certify that the victim liaison possesses the necessary level of military justice experience
       and VWAP training to support the victim.

(ADD New) 13.38. Case Development. Members of the Special Victim Capability will comply
with the requirements of the investigative support team above in Section 13P. In addition, the
locally designated judge advocate will consult with the assigned AFOSI case agent at least
monthly to assess progress in the investigation or prosecution, including ensuring any matter
raised by the victim (or their Special Victims’ Counsel, SARC, SAPR VA, FAPM, DAVA, or
other person designated to assist or represent the victim) is properly addressed.

       SVU-STC possesses the requisite litigation skills, professionalism, and leadership to
       provide the highest quality of legal representation for the government and support to
       victims. SVU-STCs must be capable of supervising, mentoring, and training junior
       counsel while providing candid, independent legal advice and expert prosecutorial
       support to responsible legal offices.

       13.39.2. Prior to being designated as a member of the SVU, a STC will generally have

       advanced litigation-skills-focused courses, received specialized training in prosecuting or
       defending sexual assaults, and demonstrated an ability to prosecute or defend a variety of
       sexual assault and/or complex cases.

       13.39.3. Based upon the severity of the case, as determined by the Chief, Government
       Trial and Appellate Division or Chief, Senior Trial Counsel, SVU-STCs will be detailed
       to Special Victim Capability cases. If a determination is made that the case does not
       warrant detailing a SVU-STC, the SVU-STC will be available to consult and provide
       litigation support to local trial counsel remotely.

       13.39.4. When possible, SVU-STCs will be detailed in the early stages of the
       investigation to provide support to local trial counsel and AFOSI case agents.

       13.39.5. If an SVU-STC is detailed to the case, the legal office should consult with the
       SVU-STC prior to the first legal office interview of the victim and prior to preferral of
       charges in the case.

(ADD New) 13.40. Legal Assistance. The trial counsel, victim liaison, and SVU-STC (when

       PURPOSE, COMMAND INFLUENCE, AND PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

1.1. Purpose. This instruction sets forth requirements for the administration of military justice.
The primary sources of rules and guidance on military justice are in the Uniform Code of
Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. § 801, et seq., and the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM).
1.2. Unlawful Command Influence (Articles 37 and 98, UCMJ; Rules for Courts-Martial
(RCM) 104). The military justice system must operate free of unlawful command influence.
Staff Judge Advocates (SJAs), their staffs, and all personnel involved in the military justice
process must be sensitive to the existence, or appearance, of unlawful command influence.
Likewise, they must be vigilant and vigorous in efforts to prevent it and to respond appropriately
to its occurrence. SJAs should periodically discuss with commanders the importance of avoiding
even the appearance of unlawful command influence, and act decisively when appraised of facts
or circumstances which might give rise to it.
1.3. Ethics and Standards of Conduct. Legal ethics and expected standards of conduct in the
Air Force are contained in the Air Force Rules of Professional Conduct and Standards for
Civility in Professional Conduct, discussed in Chapter 14, and Air Force Standards for Criminal
Justice at Attachment 3.
   1.3.1. General Application. These rules and standards apply to all military and civilian
   lawyers, paralegals and nonlawyer assistants in The Judge Advocate General’s Corps, USAF.
   1.3.2. Application to Foreign National Attorneys Overseas. These rules and standards apply
   to all foreign national lawyers employed overseas by the Department of the Air Force, to the
   extent these rules are consistent with applicable domestic law and professional standards.
   1.3.3. Application to All Practitioners in Air Force Proceedings. The rules and standards
   also apply to all lawyers, paralegals and nonlawyer assistants who practice in Air Force
   courts or other proceedings, or assist others practicing in such proceedings. This includes,
   but is not limited to, civilian defense counsel (and their associates and non-lawyer assistants)
   who have no connection to the USAF other than as participants in such proceedings.
   Military defense counsel at trial, or appellate defense counsel on appeal, shall provide copies
   of the Air Force Rules of Professional Conduct and Standards for Civility in Professional
   Conduct and the Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice, to civilian defense counsel of
   record. In any case in which military counsel is excused or not detailed, trial counsel shall
   ensure that civilian counsel has been provided the referenced rules and standards.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                    17


                                        Chapter 2

        COURT-MARTIAL CONVENING AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION

Section 2A—Court-Martial Convening Authority

2.1. General Court-Martial Convening Authority (RCM 504(b)(1)). The following Air
Force commanders may exercise general court-martial convening authority (GCMCA):
   2.1.1. Commanders of organizations identified by Article 22(a)(7), UCMJ, who have been
   authorized to exercise GCMCA by the Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF) or the express
   authorization of TJAG to convene GCMs.
   2.1.2. Commanders of organizations not identified by Article 22(a)(7), UCMJ, who are
   designated and authorized to convene GCMs by SecAF under Article 22(a)(8), UCMJ, or
   empowered by the President under Article 22(a)(9), UCMJ.
   2.1.3. Requests for authorization to exercise GCMCA are forwarded through command
   channels to AFLOA/JAJM.
2.2. Special Court-Martial Convening Authority (RCM 504(b)(2)). The following Air Force
commanders may exercise special court-martial convening authority (SPCMCA):
   2.2.1. Commanders authorized to convene GCMs under paragraph 2.1.
   2.2.2. Commanders of organizations identified by Article 23(a), UCMJ, who have been
   authorized to exercise SPCMCA by SecAF. Submit requests for SecAF action under Article
   23(a)(7) to AFLOA/JAJM.
   2.2.3. Commanders of organizations identified by Article 23(a)(4), UCMJ, who are not
   authorized to exercise SPCMCA by SecAF, but are authorized by the appropriate MAJCOM
   commander to convene special courts-martial. MAJCOM SJAs send a copy of all such
   authorizations to AFLOA/JAJM.
   2.2.4. Commanders who are not authorized to exercise SPCMCA by SecAF, can be
   authorized by the commander of an Air Force component of a unified or specified combatant
   command. The commander of an Air Force component of a unified or specified combatant
   command may only authorize subordinate commanders to exercise SPCMCA if the
   subordinate commander commands an organization identified by Article 23, UCMJ, and the
   subordinate commander commands an organization or unit assigned, or attached to the Air
   Force component commander’s command. The Air Force component command SJA sends a
   copy of all such authorizations to AFLOA/JAJM.
2.3. Summary Court-Martial Convening Authority (RCM 504(b)(3), RCM
1302). SPCMCAs and GCMCAs may convene summary courts-martial (SCM).                     The
commanding officer of a detached squadron or other detachment of the Air Force may convene a
SCM, as provided in Article 24(a)(3), UCMJ, only with the express authorization of the Air
Force GCMCA over the detached squadron or other detachment consistent with RCM
504(b)(2)(B).

Section 2B—Jurisdiction
 18                                                                         AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


2.4. Court-Martial Convening Authority Actions Involving Tenant Organizations. All
members of a tenant unit or Air Force Element (AFELM), whether designated as a unit or not,
are attached to the host command and its appropriate subordinate and higher commands for the
exercise of general, special, and summary courts-martial convening authority. On bases, to
include joint bases, where a unit of another military service has been designated as the host unit,
the Air Force unit that has the preponderance of military justice capabilities will be considered
the “host command” for the purposes of this paragraph.
      2.4.1. All members of a stand-alone Air Reserve Station or Air Reserve Base are attached to
      the host command of the nearest active duty Air Force installation and its appropriate
      subordinate and higher commands for the exercise of general, special, and summary courts-
      martial convening authority.
      2.4.2. Air National Guard (ANG) members who commit UCMJ offenses while on Title 10
      orders will ordinarily be tried by the active duty unit to which they are attached, if applicable.
      ANG members not attached to an active duty unit will be attached to the nearest active duty
      Air Force installation and its appropriate subordinate and higher commands for the exercise
      of general, special, and summary courts-martial convening authority.
      2.4.3. While attachment for court-martial convening authority purposes does not serve to
      divest any other commander from the exercise of such authority over a member of the tenant
      unit, AFELM, or members assigned or attached to a reserve station or base, the concurrent
      exercise of such authority by the host command is preferred to expeditiously resolve the
      matter, preserve resources, and retain command prerogatives pertaining to matters affecting
      the maintenance of good order and discipline within the installation. Members of a tenant
      unit, AFELM, or members assigned or attached to a reserve station or base, include
      personnel on temporary duty with or otherwise attached to it. AFI 90-1001, Responsibilities
      for Total Force Integration, may also be applicable.
         2.4.3.1. When a support agreement differing from that above is necessary or desirable, it
         must be documented at the GCMCA level or higher.
         2.4.3.2. All judge advocates assigned as senior trial counsel and senior defense counsel,
         area defense counsel, and defense paralegals are exclusively assigned to the Air Force
         Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA) for court-martial jurisdiction. All personnel
         assigned to AFLOA are exclusively attached to the Air Force District of Washington
         (AFDW) for court-martial jurisdiction. Military judges are assigned to AFDW for court-
         martial jurisdiction.
         2.4.3.3. All commissioned officers and enlisted personnel of the Department of the Air
         Force assigned or attached to Headquarters U.S. Air Force, the Office of the Secretary of
         the Air Force, the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Department of Defense, or the
         Office off the Secretary of Defense, are attached for the duration of such assignment or
         attachment to AFDW and subordinate units for general, special, and summary court-
         martial convening authority. This paragraph applies to active duty Air Force members
         and members of the reserve components (Air Force Reserve and ANG) when subject to
         the UCMJ in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 802, and it includes those personnel on
         temporary duty with, or otherwise attached to, the organization.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          19


       2.4.3.4. Commissioned officers and enlisted members whose organization is not
       subordinate to a major command and who are not stationed on an Air Force installation
       with an Air Force commander authorized to exercise general or special court-martial
       convening authority are attached to AFDW and the 11th Wing for the exercise of general,
       special, and summary court-martial convening authority. Such organizations include, but
       are not limited to, Air Force field operating agencies; Air Force direct reporting units;
       and Air Force elements of Department of Defense activities, Department of Defense field
       agencies, and other departments and agencies of the United States Government.
       Commissioned officers and enlisted members assigned to the North Atlantic Treaty
       Organization and stationed in Europe are attached to the United States Air Forces Europe
       (USAFE) for disciplinary purposes. This paragraph applies to active duty Air Force
       members and members of the reserve components (Air Force Reserve and Air National
       Guard) when subject to the UCMJ in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 802, and it includes
       those personnel on temporary duty with, or otherwise attached to, the organization.
       2.4.3.5. All inmates, parolees and members on appellate leave assigned to the Air Force
       Security Forces Center, Corrections Division, are attached to AFDW and its appropriate
       subordinate commands for the exercise of general, special, and summary court-martial
       convening authority.
   2.4.4. Sole Authority. This section is the sole authority for legal service support. No other
   order, writing or implementing agreement is required unless otherwise provided for herein.
2.5. Convening Authority Actions Involving Airmen in Joint Commands and Deployed
Areas. While a commander of a unified or specified combatant command may convene courts-
martial over members of any of the armed forces, a joint force commander normally should
allow court-martial jurisdiction over Air Force members to be exercised by the appropriate Air
Force convening authority.
   2.5.1. Airmen in a joint command, joint task force, or in a deployed area fall under the Air
   Force component commander’s chain of command for military justice purposes. Air Force
   convening authorities should exercise court-martial jurisdiction over members of other
   services only when warranted by RCM 201(e). AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization; AFI
   51-202, Nonjudicial Punishment (Procedures for Multi-service Commanders).
   2.5.2. Airmen assigned or attached to an Air Expeditionary Wing, Group, Squadron or Task
   Force fall under the Air Expeditionary chain of command for military justice purposes.
   2.5.3. Airmen remain assigned to a home station unit’s chain of command for military
   justice purposes while attached to a joint command, joint task force, or an Air Expeditionary
   chain of command.
2.6. Jurisdiction Involving State or Foreign Prosecution Interest.
   2.6.1. In General. When a member is subject to both UCMJ and state or foreign jurisdiction
   for substantially the same act or omission, the determination of which sovereign shall
   exercise jurisdiction should be made through consultation or prior agreement between
   appropriate Air Force and civilian authorities. RCM 201(d). If a state or foreign authority’s
   exercise of jurisdiction will not meet/or has not met the ends of good order and discipline, it
   may be appropriate to seek permission from SecAF to exercise UCMJ authority. Convening
   authorities and SJAs should foster relationships with local civilian authorities with a view
20                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


     toward maximizing Air Force jurisdiction. Except as discussed in paragraph 2.6.3., a
     member who is either pending trial or has been tried by a state or foreign court, regardless of
     whether the member was convicted or acquitted of the offense(s), should not ordinarily be
     tried by a court-martial or subjected to nonjudicial punishment proceedings for the same act
     or omission. This policy is based on comity between the Federal Government and state and
     foreign governments and is not intended to confer additional rights upon the accused. See
     United States v. Kohut, 44 M.J. 245, 247 (C.A.A.F. 1996) (quoting Manual of the Judge
     Advocate General of the Navy § 0124, JAGINST 5800.7C (Change 1, 1992)). This
     limitation does not apply to vacation proceedings held under RCM 1109 and Part V,
     paragraph 6a(4) of the MCM. A member may be considered to be pending trial when state or
     foreign authorities have expressed their intention to try the member, even if formal charges
     have not been brought, e.g., upon arrest of the member or a representation by civilian
     authorities that they intend to pursue the case.
  2.6.2. Procedure. When a member is subject to both UCMJ and state or foreign jurisdiction
  for substantially the same act or omission, Air Force authorities must determine whether the
  exercise of jurisdiction is in the best interests of the Air Force. If the exercise of jurisdiction
  is sought, Air Force authorities (normally the SJA) shall contact appropriate civilian
  authorities and notify them of the Air Force desire for jurisdiction. Procedures for seeking
  jurisdiction in foreign locations are discussed in paragraph 2.6.2.1. If civilian or foreign
  authorities decline or waive the right to exercise jurisdiction, the Air Force may proceed with
  military justice action, whether court-martial or nonjudicial punishment. If the civilian or
  foreign authorities are exercising or express their intention to exercise jurisdiction over the
  member, neither a court-martial nor nonjudicial punishment may proceed as a matter of
  comity until the state or foreign proceedings are completed. Ponzi v. Fessenden, 258 U.S.
  254, 260-61 (1922); United States v. Panchisin, 30 C.M.R. 921, 924-25 (A.F.B.R. 1961). If
  a member has been tried in the state or foreign proceedings, UCMJ action may not be taken
  unless approved by SecAF, as set forth in paragraph 2.6.3. If the state or foreign proceedings
  end without jeopardy attaching or if the Air Force receives clear intent that state or foreign
  proceedings will not continue pending UCMJ action, the principle of comity is satisfied and
  the Air Force may proceed with nonjudicial punishment or court-martial action.
        2.6.2.1. Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction. The procedures to determine whether U.S.
        authorities or host-nation authorities will have primary criminal jurisdiction over military
        members present in foreign countries will vary from nation to nation. The status of
        forces agreement, or similar agreement, should address procedures for dealing with
        concurrent jurisdiction offenses. AFI 51-703, Foreign Criminal Jurisdiction, and AFJI
        51-706, Status of Forces Policies, Procedures, and Information, will be followed in these
        cases.
  2.6.3. Secretarial Approval. Only SecAF may approve initiation of court-martial or
  nonjudicial punishment action against a member previously tried by a state or foreign court
  for substantially the same act or omission, regardless of whether the member was convicted
  or acquitted of the offense(s). These requests may only be submitted after the member has
  been tried in a state or foreign court. Submit requests, with full justification, through
  command channels to AFLOA/JAJM. SecAF approval will be granted in only the most
  unusual cases when the ends of justice and discipline can be satisfied in no other way. A
  member shall be deemed “tried” by a state or foreign court if:
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            21


       2.6.3.1. Jeopardy has attached. Follow the state or foreign law to determine when this
       occurs. At a minimum, jeopardy attaches when the jury is impaneled and sworn, or when
       the first witness testifies in a judge alone trial. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28 (1978). State
       law may consider a member “tried” even if the court ultimately suspends judgment upon
       discharge of the accused following probation, permits withdrawal of the guilty plea, or
       applies some form of alternative sentencing. A member will not be deemed “tried” in
       situations in which jeopardy attached in state or foreign proceedings and the civilian
       authorities released jurisdiction to the Air Force prior to resolution of the case when state
       or foreign law would have authorized further prosecutorial action (such as a mistrial).
          2.6.3.1.1. A member will not be deemed “tried” if the prosecution is deferred, held in
          abeyance, or otherwise diverted from normal channels pending completion of one or
          more conditions as an alternative to prosecution without an initial judicial
          determination of guilt. If deferral, abeyance or diversion is conditional and the
          member remains subject to prosecution should he or she violate a condition, UCMJ
          action should not be taken until after the deferral, abeyance or diversion is completed.
          As a matter of Air Force policy, UCMJ action is impermissible without first seeking
          SecAF approval.
2.7. Jurisdiction Involving Federal Agencies.
   2.7.1. Department of Justice (DoJ). DoDI 5525.07, Implementation of the Memorandum of
   Understand (MOU) Between the Departments of Justice (DoJ) and Defense Relating to the
   Investigation and Prosecution of Certain Crimes, sets forth DoD and DoJ responsibilities for
   investigating and prosecuting offenses over which the two departments have concurrent
   jurisdiction.
   2.7.2. U.S. Secret Service. The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) exercises primary investigative
   responsibility for all cases involving alleged threats against the President or successors to the
   Presidency. 18 U.S.C. § 3056. The Chief, AFLOA/JAJM, or a designee, will meet with
   representatives of DoJ and USSS to determine which department will exercise further
   jurisdiction in the case.
   2.7.3. The Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 2000 (18 U.S.C. § 3261, et seq)
   (MEJA). Military members, as well as civilians accompanying the force, may be subject to
   United States civilian federal jurisdiction for offenses committed while overseas. Submit a
   report of any potential case involving MEJA, through command channels, to AFLOA/JAJM.
   See AFI 51-1001, Delivery of Personnel to United States Civilian Authorities for Trial, and
   AFPD 51-10, Making Military Personnel, Employees, and Dependents Available to Civilian
   Authorities, for substantive procedural guidance and procedures.
   2.7.4. A member either pending trial or who has been tried by a Federal court may not be
   tried by court-martial or subjected to nonjudicial punishment proceedings for the same act or
   omission.

Section 2C—Completion of Service

2.8. Completion of Military Service (RCM 202).
 22                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


      2.8.1. Court-martial jurisdiction extends to those persons whose enlistments have expired,
      but are awaiting discharge. Article 2(a)(1) and Article 3(a), UCMJ. Action with a view to
      trial must be taken as soon as practicable to preserve jurisdiction. RCM 202(c).
      2.8.2. Generally, jurisdiction to try a member of the military by court-martial ceases upon
      discharge or other separation. Jurisdiction over active duty military personnel normally
      continues until the member receives a valid discharge certificate, there is a final accounting
      of pay, and the member has completed administrative clearance processes required by his or
      her service Secretary. United States v. Hart, 66 M.J. 273 (C.A.A.F. 2008). SJAs should
      recognize that exceptions to this general rule might apply including regaining military
      jurisdiction for members upon reentry into military service. See RCM 202(a), Discussion
      (2)(B)(iii) and RCM 204(d). A GCMCA may recall an Airman separated or discharged prior
      to the expiration of a term of service on active duty so long as the Airman has a reserve
      commitment as a member of a reserve component. If the matter results in trial by court-
      martial, the record of trial (ROT) must include evidence that establishes jurisdiction over the
      accused.

Section 2D—Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Members

2.9. Jurisdiction Over Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Members (RCM 202).
   2.9.1. In General. ANG Members while in Federal status and Air Reserve members
   including retired members are subject to UCMJ jurisdiction for offenses committed while on
   active duty or on inactive duty training status. Reserve members performing continuous duty
   in an inactive duty for training status overseas are subject to UCMJ jurisdiction from the
   commencement to the conclusion of such duty. ANG members are subject to UCMJ
   jurisdiction only when in Title 10, Federal service.
   2.9.2. Courts-Martial. Once jurisdiction attaches in accordance with RCM 202(c), a member
   of a reserve component may either be retained on active duty pending disposition of offenses,
   or be released to reserve status and recalled as necessary for preferral of charges, pretrial
   investigation, and trial by court-martial. Prior consultation with the member’s reserve
   component chain of command through JA channels is required. If the member is no longer
   on active duty when the offense is discovered, the member may be involuntarily ordered to
   active duty for preferral of charges, a pretrial investigation, and trial by court-martial. In any
   case in which the accused is a member of the Reserve or ANG, trial counsel must introduce
   sufficient evidence to establish in-personam jurisdiction over the accused at the time of the
   offense.
   2.9.3. Summary Courts-Martial and Nonjudicial Punishment. Do not involuntarily recall a
   reserve member to active duty solely to impose nonjudicial punishment or for trial by SCM.
   Initiate nonjudicial punishment or an SCM during the member’s next period of inactive duty
   training or active duty. MAJCOM commanders or equivalents may grant waivers to this
   restriction in appropriate cases.
   2.9.4. Recall Authority. Subject to the consultation requirement of paragraph 2.9.2, the
   following may order a Reserve or ANG member to active duty:
         2.9.4.1. A GCMCA for the regular component unit to which the member is attached for
         training purposes;
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                       23


     2.9.4.2. A GCMCA for the regular component unit in which the member performed duty
     when the offense(s) occurred;
     2.9.4.3. A GCMCA of the regular component host unit, as designated in the applicable
     host-tenant support agreement if the member is assigned to a reserve component unit for
     training purposes, or was attached to such a unit when the offense(s) occurred; or
     2.9.4.4. AFRC/CC, 4 AF/CC, 10 AF/CC, or 22 AF/CC for members assigned or attached
     to their respective commands.
     2.9.4.5. A GCMCA of the host command of members of an Air Reserve Station or Base
     described in paragraph 2.4.1.
  2.9.5. Limitations on Punishment. A Reserve or ANG member recalled to active duty for
  court-martial without SecAF approval may not be sentenced to confinement or be required to
  serve a punishment consisting of any restriction on liberty during the recall period of duty.
  See Article 2(d)(5), UCMJ. A punishment of restriction to specified limits may be imposed
  only during periods of inactive duty training or active duty ordered for routine (non-
  disciplinary) purposes. Requests for SecAF approval to recall a reserve member for court-
  martial to preserve the possibility that the sentence may include confinement are forwarded,
  via command channels, to AFLOA/JAJM. Generally, requests should be made prior to
  preferral of charges, but, in any case, must be approved prior to arraignment. The GCMCA
  must concur in the request and the request shall include as a minimum, the following
  information:
     2.9.5.1. The preferred or anticipated charges and specifications. When charges have
     been preferred, attach a copy of the charge sheet and personal data sheet.
     2.9.5.2. A summary of the evidence relating to each offense. Attach copies of any
     reports of investigation/inquiry or witness statements.
     2.9.5.3. Prior convictions and nonjudicial punishments.
     2.9.5.4. Whether the member refused an offer of nonjudicial punishment.
     2.9.5.5. The member’s background, including               civilian   employment,   family
     circumstances, and character of military service.
     2.9.5.6. Consultation with the member’s reserve component chain of command, such as
     the unit commander (state adjutant general for an ANG member performing Federal
     service).
  2.9.6. Release from Active Duty. At the conclusion of nonjudicial punishment proceedings
  or final adjournment of the court-martial, the reserve component member who was ordered to
  active duty for the purpose of conducting disciplinary proceedings should be released from
  active duty within one working day unless the order to active duty was approved by SecAF
  and confinement or other restriction on liberty was adjudged. Unserved punishments may be
  carried over to subsequent periods of inactive-duty training or active duty. RCM 1003(c)(3);
  RCM 204(b); Article 2(d). Absent contrary binding authority, a reserve component member
  recalled to active duty with SecAF approval should remain on active duty orders for the
  duration of confinement or other restriction on liberty the member actually serves. The
  court-martial convening authority who convenes the court shall fund the active duty orders of
  the reserve component member being court-martialed, including the duration of confinement.
 24                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


Section 2E—Retired Personnel

2.10. Jurisdiction Over Retired Air Force Personnel. Retired regular Air Force personnel
who are entitled to receive pay (Article 2(a)(4), UCMJ), retired members of a reserve component
who are receiving hospitalization from an armed service (Article 2(a)(5), UCMJ), and retired
members of a reserve component subject to lawful orders to return to duty (See Morgan v.
Mahoney, 50 M.J. 633 (A. F. Ct. Crim. App. 1999)), will not be tried by court-martial for
acts/omissions while on active duty or inactive duty training, within the statute of limitations,
unless their conduct clearly links them with the military or is adverse to a significant military
interest of the United States. SecAF approval is required prior to preferral of charges unless
there is an immediate statute of limitations problem. If the time prescribed by the statute of
limitations is about to expire, prefer charges and request SecAF approval as soon as possible.
Send requests for approval, with full justification, to AFLOA/JAJM.

Section 2F—General Officers

2.11. Jurisdiction Over General Officers. Only commanders of Air Force MAJCOMs and
superior convening authorities may exercise court-martial convening authority over Air Force
general officers. This limitation does not apply to the exercise of court-martial convening
authority by the commanding officer of a unified command.

Section 2G—Other Persons

2.12. Jurisdiction Over DoD Civilian Employees, DoD Contractor Personnel, and Other
Persons Serving With or Accompanying the Armed Forces Overseas During Declared War
and in Contingency Operations (Article 2(a)(10), UCMJ).
   2.12.1. Article 2(a)(10) Jurisdiction. Only the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) possesses
   the authority to exercise court-martial convening authority and impose nonjudicial
   punishment (NJP) over persons subject to Article 2(a)(10) with respect to: offenses
   committed within the “United States,” meaning the several States of the United States, the
   District of Columbia, and the commonwealths, territories, and possessions of the United
   States; persons who were not at all times during the alleged misconduct located outside the
   “United States,” as defined above; and persons who are, at the time court-martial charges are
   preferred or notice of NJP proceedings is given, located within the “United States,” as
   defined above. See SECDEF Memorandum (DTM-08-009), dated 10 March 2008, UCMJ
   Jurisdiction Over DoD Civilian Employees, DoD Contractor Personnel, and Other Persons
   Serving With or Accompanying the Armed Forces Overseas During Declared War and in
   Contingency Operations.
       2.12.1.1. Only SECDEF, geographic combatant commanders (CCDRs), and
       commanders assigned or attached to geographic combatant commands who also possess
       GCMCA may exercise court-martial convening authority and impose NJP over persons
       subject to Article 2(a)(10) with respect to offenses committed outside the "United States,"
       as defined in paragraph 2.12.1. Geographic CCDRs may withhold this authority within
       their command.
       2.12.1.2. Authority to prefer court-martial charges and offer NJP is withheld until the
       notification requirements outlined in paragraph 2.12.4 are accomplished.          Law
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                        25


     enforcement, criminal investigations, and other military justice procedures that precede
     the preferral of court-martial charges should continue, as applicable, during this
     notification process.
     2.12.1.3. Authority to prefer court-martial charges and offer NJP is withheld whenever
     DoJ provides notice that it intends to pursue federal criminal prosecution for what is
     substantially the same offense or a related offense, and such withholding of authority
     shall remain in effect while DoJ is pursuing its federal prosecution of the case until such
     prosecution is completed or terminated prior to its completion.
  2.12.2. Command Law Enforcement Authority. Commanders at all levels have the authority
  to investigate any crime allegedly committed by persons subject to the UCMJ, as well as
  persons subject to MEJA jurisdiction until such time as law enforcement officials have
  assumed sole investigative responsibility. Such investigations shall be conducted in
  accordance with practices established with host nation authorities, applicable international
  law, and international agreements. All criminal allegations shall be coordinated with the
  appropriate military law enforcement agency such as AFOSI or SFS. Additionally, if the
  crime committed falls within the investigative jurisdiction of the military law enforcement
  agency, commanders must notify the appropriate agency to determine if a criminal
  investigation will be initiated. AFI 71-101v1, Criminal Investigations Program, Attachment
  2.
     2.12.2.1. Apprehension and Arrest. Military law enforcement officers and military
     criminal investigators are authorized to apprehend persons subject to UCMJ jurisdiction,
     and arrest and temporarily detain persons subject to MEJA jurisdiction, when there is
     probable cause that an offense has been committed and that the person committed it,
     subject to the requirements of RCMs 304 and 305. Although all commissioned, warrant,
     petty, and noncommissioned officers on active duty may apprehend persons subject to
     UCMJ jurisdiction, absent exigent circumstances, the apprehension of civilians should be
     done by law enforcement personnel. The apprehension and arrest of civilians in a foreign
     nation is almost exclusively a host nation function. When the apprehension, arrest, or
     temporary detention of a civilian by U.S. authorities is appropriate, such action shall be
     done in accordance with established procedures, applicable international law, and
     international agreements.
     2.12.2.2. Pretrial Restraint and Confinement. Commanders may order the pretrial
     restraint or confinement of civilians subject to the limitations of RCM 304(b) and all
     applicable provisions of the MCM and this instruction. Absent exigent circumstances,
     Article 2(a)(10) personnel shall not be placed in pretrial restraint or confinement without
     first consulting with the SJA of the appropriate geographic CCDR.
  2.12.3. Command Discretion. The unique nature of exercising UCMJ jurisdiction over
  civilians requires commanders to evaluate legal and policy considerations before initiating
  any punitive disciplinary action.
     2.12.3.1. Legal Considerations. Article 2(a)(10) applies to individuals serving with or
     accompanying the Air Force, Army, Navy, Marines, or Coast Guard in the field during
     declared war or contingency operations. See 10 U.S.C. § 101(a)(13). This generally
     includes DoD civilian employees and contractors, as well as individuals who are
     dependent on or connected to the armed forces in some manner. See United States v.
26                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


     Burney, 21 C.M.R. 98 (C.M.A. 1956); Perlstein v. United States et al., 151 F. 2d. 167 (3d
     Cir. 1945). It can also include both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals, but international
     agreements will likely impact punitive action against any foreign national. Before taking
     any steps to initiate UCMJ action, it is critical to establish whether or not Article 2(a)(10)
     jurisdiction applies.
     2.12.3.2. Policy Considerations. Even if an individual is legally subject to the UCMJ, as
     a matter of policy the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 2(a)(10) must also be based
     on military necessity to support an effective fighting force and be called for by
     circumstances that meet the interests of justice, such as when federal criminal jurisdiction
     otherwise does not apply or federal criminal prosecution is not pursued, or when the
     person’s conduct is adverse to a significant military interest of the United States (e.g.,
     alleged misconduct that may jeopardize good order and discipline or discredit the armed
     forces and thereby have a potential adverse effect on military operations).
  2.12.4. Notification Requirements and Procedures. Before initiating any disciplinary action
  against any person under Article 2(a)(10), commanders, through their SJAs, shall comply
  with the notification procedures outlined below.
     2.12.4.1. General Requirements. In all cases intended to be pursued under Article
     2(a)(10), all levels of command must follow the notification requirements of DoD
     Instruction 5525.11, Criminal Jurisdiction Over Civilians Employed By or Accompanying
     the Armed Forces Outside the United States, Certain Service Members, and Former
     Service Members and General Counsel of the Department of Defense Memorandum,
     dated 20 January 2012, Policy and Procedures Applicable to DoD and United States
     Coast Guard (USCG) Civilian Personnel Subject to Uniform Code of Military Justice
     (UCMJ) Jurisdiction in Time of Declared War or a Contingency Operation (Attachment
     2). This includes forwarding all reasonably available information regarding the
     investigation, the suspect’s last known residence in the United States, and the reasoning
     in support of a UCMJ disposition. Potential Article 2(a)(10) cases also trigger special
     interest reporting requirements under paragraph 13.8 and must be immediately reported
     to AFLOA/JAJM.
     2.12.4.2. Non-GCMCA Notification Requirements. Commanders who are not GCMCAs
     shall, before initiating any UCMJ disposition under RCMs 306-308 or 401-406, forward
     expeditiously all available information regarding the alleged misconduct that is
     potentially subject to this jurisdiction to the first GCMCA in the chain of command that
     is attached or assigned to a geographic combatant command.
     2.12.4.3. GCMCA Notification Requirements. GCMCAs assigned or attached to a
     geographic combatant command shall notify in writing (including by e-mail or facsimile)
     their respective geographic CCDR of their intended disposition by court-martial or NJP
     over persons subject to Article 2(a)(10).
     2.12.4.4. Geographic CCDR Notification Requirements. Before any commander prefers
     court-martial charges or before a commander authorized by paragraph 2.12.1.1 offers
     NJP based on Article 2(a)(10), and regardless of whether the suspected offense may also
     be an offense under federal criminal laws, the geographic CCDR shall first provide notice
     of the case in writing (including by e-mail or facsimile) in accordance with the
     procedures established in DoD Instruction 5525.11 and the General Counsel’s
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                        27


     memorandum dated 20 January 2012, through DoD channels so that DoJ may be afforded
     the opportunity to pursue federal criminal prosecution.
     2.12.4.5. DoJ-DoD Notification Requirements. After DoD’s formal notification to DoJ,
     DoJ is to expeditiously (but in no case longer than 14 calendar days absent an extension)
     notify DoD whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction over the case. If DoJ elects to
     exercise jurisdiction over the case, authority to convene a court-martial or administer NJP
     is withheld. If DoJ does not exercise jurisdiction or terminates prosecution, or if
     permission to proceed is granted by SECDEF or his designee, UCMJ action may be
     initiated. DoD Instruction 5525.11 and the General Counsel’s memorandum dated 20
     January 2012.
  2.12.5. Court-Martial Rights and Procedures. The MCM ensures a fair trial and due process
  of law for all persons tried before a properly constituted court-martial. The following
  clarifications will assist all parties with interpreting the MCM and applicable regulations.
     2.12.5.1. Military Defense Counsel. An accused under Article 2(a)(10) has the same
     rights to counsel as a military accused subject to the requirements prescribed in the
     Military Defense Counsel Charter, including the right to be represented by a detailed
     military defense counsel, the right to request an individual military defense counsel, and
     the right to be represented by a civilian defense counsel at no expense to the government.
     2.12.5.2. Court Members. Only commissioned officers on active duty are eligible to
     serve on a court-martial for the trial of any accused under Article 2(a)(10). A convening
     authority may, but is not required to, consider rank equivalencies by comparing military
     and civilian pay tables when selecting officer members for an accused who holds a
     federal civilian position. An accused under Article 2(a)(10) does not have the right to
     request enlisted court members.
     2.12.5.3. Punishments. Subject to the limitations of the MCM, a court-martial may
     adjudge only the following punishments for an accused under Article 2(a)(10):
     reprimand, fine, restriction to specified limits, confinement, and death.
 28                                                                       AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


                                              Chapter 3

         MILITARY MAGISTRATES, PRETRIAL RESTRAINT, AND PREFERRAL

Section 3A—Military Magistrates

3.1. Military Magistrate Program.
      3.1.1. Appointment of Magistrate (MRE 315(d)(2)). The commander of the lowest
      organizational level having command over an Air Force installation, who is either an
      SPCMCA or GCMCA, or the installation commander at Air Force Reserve Command
      (AFRC) bases and stations, may appoint a maximum of four officers with judicial
      temperament to serve as military magistrates for that installation. For installations, such as
      joint bases, comprised of multiple geographically separated locations, a maximum of four
      officers may be appointed as magistrates for each geographically separated location. If
      unique circumstances exist that warrant the appointment of more than four magistrates,
      permission to appoint additional magistrates must be obtained from the GCMCA and
      approved by AFLOA/JAJM. Appoint magistrates in writing by name, not position, and
      specify the installation over which the magistrates may exercise authority.
      3.1.2. Qualifications. A military magistrate should be an officer serving in the grade of
      lieutenant colonel or above. The appointment of any magistrate in the rank of major or
      below may only be made by, or with the concurrence of, the GCMCA exercising jurisdiction
      over the installation. Chaplains, SJA office personnel, Air Force Office of Special
      Investigations (AFOSI) and Security Forces (SF) members, and court-martial convening
      authorities may not serve as military magistrates. Officers appointed at AFRC installations
      must be serving a period of inactive duty training or active duty to perform magistrate duties.
      3.1.3. Authority. A military magistrate issues search and seizure, and apprehension
      authorizations based upon probable cause. If more than one magistrate is appointed for an
      installation or location, each exercises concurrent authority with the others and with the
      installation commander. The commander need not be unavailable for a magistrate to exercise
      this authority.
      3.1.4. Non-Air Force Military Installations. The Air Force commander who is either a
      SPCMCA or GCMCA for a military installation where the installation commander is not an
      Air Force commander may appoint an officer with judicial temperament to serve as a military
      magistrate for matters involving Air Force personnel on the installation. A military
      magistrate appointed under this paragraph is authorized to issue search and seizure and
      apprehension authorizations, based on probable cause, involving Air Force personnel at non-
      Air Force military installations to the extent the commander appointing the military
      magistrate has control over the place where the property or person to be searched is situated
      or found, or over the person to be apprehended. MRE 315(d)(1). This military magistrate
      exercises concurrent authority with the commander who appointed him or her.
      3.1.5. SJA Duties. The SJA for the commander appointing military magistrates should
      ensure the military magistrates are briefed on their duties at the time of their appointment and
      whenever necessary thereafter.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          29


Section 3B—Pretrial Confinement and Restraint

3.2. Pretrial Confinement (RCM 305). An authorized person must determine if there is
probable cause to order pretrial confinement. Once the member is placed in pretrial
confinement, additional steps must occur to determine if it is appropriate to continue pretrial
confinement: a 48-hour probable cause determination, a 72-hour commander’s decision and
memorandum, and a pretrial confinement review (within 7 days). Normally, offenses to be
disposed of by an SCM do not warrant pretrial confinement. NOTE: Imposition of pretrial
confinement or restraint will trigger the speedy trial clock under RCM 707.
   3.2.1. Probable Cause for Pretrial Confinement. No person may be ordered into pretrial
   confinement except for probable cause. Probable cause to order pretrial confinement exists
   when there is a reasonable belief that an offense triable by court-martial has been committed,
   the person confined committed it, and confinement is required by the circumstances.
   Additional matters to consider include the person’s background and character, the details of
   the offense, and the matters in the Discussion following RCM 305(h)(2)(B). The person who
   directs confinement need not conduct a detailed analysis of the circumstances before
   physically detaining the person if time does not permit. See RCM 305(d).
   3.2.2. 48-Hour Probable Cause Determination. Within 48 hours of the imposition of
   confinement under military control, a neutral and detached officer must review the adequacy
   of probable cause to continue pretrial confinement. RCM 305(i)(1); Gerstein v. Pugh, 420
   U.S. 103, 124-25 (1975); County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 45 (S.Ct. 1991).
   See format at Figure 3.1. If the determination is not made within 48 hours, the government
   may have to establish the existence of a bona fide emergency or other extraordinary
   circumstances. The determination should be in writing and included in the Record of Trial
   (ROT).
       3.2.2.1. Include in the ROT any documentation regarding a determination of probable
       cause made by civilian authorities prior to transfer of the member to military authorities.
       When a military member is transferred from civilian confinement to military control,
       authorities must still conduct a 48-hour probable cause determination.
       3.2.2.2. Factors to consider in determining whether an officer is neutral and detached
       include whether the officer is the formal accuser on the charge sheet, is the officer who
       ordered the accused into confinement, or is directly or particularly involved in the
       command’s law enforcement functions. United States v. Rexroat, 38 M.J. 292, 298
       (C.M.A. 1993); United States v. Lynch, 13 M.J. 394, 397 (C.M.A. 1982).
       3.2.2.3. The Pretrial Confinement Review in paragraph 3.2.4 will satisfy the 48-hour
       probable cause determination if the Pretrial Confinement Review memorandum is
       completed within 48 hours of the imposition of confinement.
   3.2.3. 72-Hour Commander’s Decision and Memorandum. A commander shall decide
   whether to continue pretrial confinement not later than 72 hours after the commander orders
   a military member into pretrial confinement, or after receipt of a report that a member of the
   commander’s unit or organization has been confined. The commander must address the
   requirements for confinement in RCM 305(h)(2)(B) and should consider the factors in the
   Discussion to that section. If the commander decides to continue pretrial confinement, he or
   she must prepare a written memorandum in accordance with RCM 305(h)(2)(C). The
30                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


     memorandum is then forwarded to the Pretrial Confinement Review Officer (PCRO),
     through the SJA and SPCMCA. If court-martial results, the commander’s memorandum
     must be included in the ROT. Figure 3.2. provides a sample format.
        3.2.3.1. The 72-hour commander’s decision will satisfy the 48-hour probable cause
        determination only if the commander is neutral and detached and acts within 48 hours of
        the imposition of confinement. RCM 305(h)(2)(A). See Figure 3.2.
 3.2.4. Pretrial Confinement Review (PCR), (RCM 305(i)(2)). Within 7 calendar days of the
 imposition of pretrial confinement under military control (the day placed in confinement
 counts as day 1 and the date of review shall count as one day), the PCRO must review the
 probable cause determination and make a decision about the necessity for continued pretrial
 confinement. United States v. McCants, 39 M.J. 91, 93 (C.M.A. 1994) (quoting RCM
 305(i)(1)).
        3.2.4.1. Appointment of PCROs, (RCM 305(i)(2)). The SPCMCA appoints, by letter, a
        reasonable number of mature officers to serve as PCROs. Chaplains, SJA office
        personnel, AFOSI and SF members, and court-martial convening authorities may not
        serve as a PCRO. Military magistrates may also be appointed as PCROs. When the
        situation warrants, a PCRO from another military service may be appointed. Similarly,
        an otherwise qualified Air Force member may serve as a PCRO for another military
        service. Except in unusual circumstances, a magistrate should not serve as the PCRO if
        he or she otherwise acted upon the same case in any capacity.
        3.2.4.2. The PCRO must review the commander’s decision to continue pretrial
        confinement satisfying the 72-hour requirement. The PCRO should consider any matters
        submitted by the pretrial confinee.
           3.2.4.2.1. The PCR may satisfy the 48-hour probable cause determination
           requirement if the PCR memorandum is completed within 48 hours of the imposition
           of confinement. In such cases, the PCR memorandum must specifically state when
           the probable cause determination was made.
        3.2.4.3. The PCRO conducts a hearing at which the pretrial confinee and defense counsel
        shall be allowed to appear and make a statement before the PCRO, if practicable.
        Defense counsel may also represent their client at the hearing via telephone or
        videoteleconference technology. A government representative, usually a judge advocate,
        may also make a statement, if practicable. Although the PCR is not an adversarial
        proceeding, the PCRO may exercise his or her discretion by allowing the pretrial
        confinee, defense counsel or government representative to present evidence and cross-
        examine witnesses. The PCRO must complete a written summary of the relevant
        testimony of any witnesses, including information elicited by defense counsel. The only
        rules of evidence that apply are MRE 302, MRE 305 and Section V of the Military Rules
        of Evidence concerning Privileges.
           3.2.4.3.1. Provided custody classification does not dictate a distinctive uniform, a
           pretrial confinee must be allowed to wear an Air Force duty uniform for the PCR
           rather than civilian confinement attire. See AFI 31-205, The Air Force Corrections
           System, paragraph 7.1.5.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            31


         3.2.4.3.2. The pretrial confinee and/or defense counsel may present evidence related
         to confinement conditions in apparent violation of Article 12 or Article 13, UCMJ. If
         such evidence is presented, the PCRO shall summarize the evidence in the PCRO
         memorandum and inform the SJA. The SJA shall review the evidence pertaining to
         allegedly illegal confinement conditions and work with the member’s commander and
         the local Security Forces Commander or other confinement officials to remedy the
         situation as necessary.
     3.2.4.4. Upon completion of the PCR, the PCRO shall approve continued confinement or
     order immediate release. To continue pretrial confinement, the PCRO must find the
     requirements of RCM 305(h)(2)(B) have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence
     to continue pretrial confinement. If the requirements of RCM 305(h)(2)(B) have not been
     proven, the PCRO must order immediate release of the pretrial confinee. The PCRO may
     not impose conditions on release, but may recommend the commander impose a less
     severe form of pretrial restraint. If the PCRO orders release, a commander may impose
     any alternative lesser form of pretrial restraint authorized by RCM 304(a)(1) through (3).
     3.2.4.5. Within 24 hours of making the pretrial confinement decision, the PCRO must
     complete a memorandum of the PCRO’s conclusions and the findings on which they are
     based. A copy of all documents and summaries of all oral statements considered by the
     PCRO must be attached to the memorandum. The memorandum with attachments shall
     be provided to the SPCMCA, the SPCMCA’s SJA, the confinement officer, the pretrial
     confinee and the pretrial confinee’s defense counsel. Figure 3.3 provides a sample
     format for the PCRO’s memorandum.
  3.2.5. Pretrial Restraint Upon Release From Confinement. A commander may impose any
  alternative lesser form of pretrial restraint authorized by RCM 304(a)(1) through (3), if
  release is ordered by the PCRO. Re-confinement after release is limited to circumstances
  provided in RCM 305(l). United States v. Mahoney, 36 M.J. 679 (A.F.C.M.R. 1992)
  (dictum). The requirements of this chapter apply to a member upon imposition of re-
  confinement.
  3.2.6. Pretrial Restraint as Suicide Prevention. Preventing an accused from committing
  suicide is not valid as the sole basis for ordering the accused into or continuing pretrial
  confinement. A distinction shall be drawn between an accused that is a threat to him or
  herself and an accused that is either a threat to flee the jurisdiction to avoid prosecution or is
  a threat to commit a serious offense. The latter may be placed in pretrial confinement in
  accordance with RCM 305(h)(2)(B). The former should be referred to mental health
  practitioners for evaluation and treatment and, if necessary, involuntary commitment in a
  mental health facility. United States v. Doane, 54 M.J. 978, 982 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2001).
  3.2.7. Pretrial Determination of Mental Competence. A convening authority may determine
  the place and condition of pretrial detention, including confinement in a civilian facility, for
  the purpose of evaluating the competency of the accused, subject to review by a military
  judge for abuse of discretion. The conditions may not be more harsh than necessary to
  ensure the accused’s presence at trial. The facility must be capable of rendering the
  necessary competency evaluations and providing necessary care and treatment of the
  accused. Article 13, UCMJ; RCM 706, 909; Short v. Chambers, 33 M.J. 49, 52 (C.M.A.
  1991); 18 U.S.C. § 4241.
 32                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


      3.2.8. SJA Duties. SJAs must ensure confinement personnel advise pretrial confinees in
      accordance with RCM 305(e). SJAs must ensure PCROs are briefed on their duties when
      appointed, and updated as appropriate thereafter. SJAs must ensure alleged victims are
      notified of a confinee’s pretrial confinement and release from pretrial confinement. Consult
      AFI 51-703, if a member is confined at the request of foreign host nation authorities.

Section 3C—Preferral of Charges (RCM 307)

3.3. Considerations Prior to Preferral of Charges.
      3.3.1. Accuser is Senior to the Convening Authority. Consult RCM 504(c)(2) and (3) when
      the accuser is senior in rank to the convening authority.
      3.3.2. Authority To Proceed in Cases Involving an Accused with Special Access. Do not
      take action on personnel who hold or have held access to Single Integrated Operation Plan-
      Extremely Sensitive Information (SIOP-ESI), Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI),
      research and development (R&D) special access program, AFOSI special access program, or
      other special access program information until the appropriate special access program office
      approves. Legal offices ensure compliance with AFI 31-501, Personnel Security Program
      Management. In accordance with AFI 31-501, paragraph 8.9, commanders must submit a
      written request to the appropriate special access program functional office for permission to
      proceed with further processing before initiating action against military members that could
      lead to a discharge. The legal office must also ensure a copy of the commander’s written
      request is sent to AFLOA/JAJM. Apply security classification according to message
      contents and send through classified channels as required. In accordance with AFI 31-501,
      paragraph 8.9.8, if a commander contemplates a general or special court-martial, processing
      of the case may proceed with preferral of charges and completion of the investigation
      required by Article 32, UCMJ, together with collateral actions required under Article 32.
      Under no circumstances may the charges be referred to trial until the appropriate action
      office grants authority to proceed. It is recommended that authority to proceed be sought
      before preferral and as soon as possible due to the length of time it takes to process these
      requests.
      3.3.3. Preferral in Lengthy Absence Cases. Effective 14 November 1986, summary court-
      martial convening authorities (SCMCAs) are no longer required to receipt for charges
      alleging either desertion or AWOL in order to toll the statute of limitations. Article 43,
      UCMJ. Therefore, where an unauthorized absence began after 14 November 1986, preferral
      and receipt for charges is not required to toll the statute of limitations. For all lengthy
      absence cases for which charges were preferred on or before 14 November 1986 where the
      member has not yet returned to military control, preferred charges, receipted for by the
      SCMCA are still required to toll the limitations period. The servicing SJA should obtain a
      written delay from the appropriate convening authority to stop the running of the clock under
      the RCM 707 speedy trial rule. Documentation of approved delays shall be attached to the
      charge sheet in the member’s personnel records before sending the records to the Air Force
      Personnel Center. AFI 36-2911, Desertion and Unauthorized Absence. Charges for
      desertion or an unauthorized absence, either of which began before 14 November 1986,
      where there was no preferral and receipt of charges, are not viable.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         33


   3.3.4. Extension Beyond Expiration of Term of Service (ETS). Airmen may be retained
   beyond their ETS in anticipation of the preferral of charges. If there is sufficient time, the
   SJA must notify the FSS Career Development Section in writing. If time does not permit
   written notification, written confirmation of the verbal notice should be provided to the FSS
   within five duty days. Contact FSS Career Development Section for the current format of the
   written notice and request and ensure the written notice and request is sent to AFPC/DPSOS
   for final action. See AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen. See also, Webb v.
   United States, 67 M.J. 765 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2009).
   3.3.5. Accused With Prior Adjudged Punitive Discharge. If an accused has an approved, but
   unexecuted, prior punitive discharge, the SJA for the SPCMCA over the accused shall
   immediately notify AFLOA/JAJM concerning preferral of new charges, with information
   copies sent to the appropriate GCMCA and MAJCOM SJAs. This notice enables
   AFLOA/JAJM to ensure that the execution of the previous punitive discharge does not occur,
   providing continuing court-martial jurisdiction over the accused.
   3.3.6. Recoupment. If an accused received education assistance, special pay, or bonus
   money and faces separation or discharge before completion of the agreed-upon period of
   active duty, notice of recoupment should be given when court-martial charges are preferred
   in accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 2005(g), or 37 U.S.C. § 303a(e). The member should sign a
   statement of understanding regarding recoupment as shown in Figure 3.5. This notice is
   included in the ROT with pretrial allied papers in accordance with AFMAN 51-203, Records
   of Trial, Figure 4.1, paragraph 20.
3.4. Charge Sheet Preparation.
   3.4.1. Charge Sheet. Prepare charges and specifications on the DD Form 458, Charge Sheet.
   The Charge Sheet should be prepared by inputting the data into AMJAMS and printing out
   the electronic version of the DD Form 458. Information in AMJAMS should be reflected as
   follows:
   3.4.2. Blocks 1, 2, 3 and 4. Autofill information in AMJAMS from AFPC and ensure its
   accuracy. Make pen and ink changes to the charge sheet to reflect any change in the
   accused’s grade prior to arraignment by lining through and keeping the information legible.
   Initial any changes.
   3.4.3. Block 5. Enter the accused’s assigned organization under the Duty Status tab in
   AMJAMS. The address should reflect the base name, state and zip. Ensure the correct pull
   down is selected for your MAJCOM. At squadron level, enter “111th Civil Engineer
   Squadron,” not “111th Civil Engineering Squadron Section.” For members of the Reserve
   and ANG serving on extended active duty, use the organization to which they are attached
   for active duty.
   3.4.4. Block 6. The accused’s current service is the date the current enlistment began for
   enlisted personnel or the Total Active Federal Military Service Date (TAFMSD) for officers.
   Extensions do not change the current enlistment date. This information can be found in the
   accused’s personnel records or in the record review listing prepared by the servicing
   personnel office. Double check the Reports on Individual Personnel (RIPs) against the
   information autofilled from AFPC.
34                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


  3.4.5. Block 7. The accused’s current pay per month will be entered automatically, this will
  need to be changed if AFPC lists the incorrect rank. If it changes prior to arraignment,
  correct it with a pen and ink change and initial.
  3.4.6. Blocks 8 and 9. Include any form of restraint, including restraint by civil authorities at
  the request of the Air Force, by adding the pretrial restraint folder under the pretrial
  information in AMJAMS. An example of this is when a member in an AWOL or deserter
  status is apprehended pursuant to a DD Form 553, Deserter/Absentee Wanted by the Armed
  Forces, by civilian police and incarcerated or detained until Air Force officials take custody
  of the accused.
  3.4.7. Charges and Specifications. Consult RCM 307 and refer to the sample specifications
  in the MCM, Part IV, and the Military Judge’s Benchbook, DA Pamphlet 27-9. AMJAMS
  will auto-fill the charge and specification indicators automatically. When alleging Article
  134 offenses, ensure the specification alleges the terminal element, as required by United
  States v. Fosler, 70 M.J. 225 (C.A.A.F. 2011). Additionally, use caution when reviewing
  lesser included offenses (LIOs) listed in the MCM, Part IV, to ensure the LIOs comport with
  the elements test set forth in United States v. Jones, 68 M.J. 465 (C.A.A.F. 2010).
     3.4.7.1. Format. Type the words “CHARGE” and “ADDITIONAL CHARGE” in all
     capital letters. “Specification” includes upper and lower case letters. Where more than
     one charge or specification is alleged, charges are numbered with Roman numerals (e.g.,
     I, II, III) and specifications with Arabic numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3). A single charge or
     specification is not numbered.
     3.4.7.2. Additional Charges. When additional charges are preferred, add “Additional
     Charges Preferred.” AMJAMS will label the charges as ADDITIONAL CHARGES. If
     charges are preferred after preferral of additional charges, add another “Additional
     Charges Preferred” folder in AMJAMS. AMJAMS will label each new set of charges
     with written numbers (e.g., SECOND ADDITIONAL CHARGES, THIRD
     ADDITIONAL CHARGES).
     3.4.7.3. Identification of the Accused. In the specifications, identify the accused by
     present grade, followed by the grade on the date of the alleged offense, if different. Use
     all capital letters. Do not include the MAJCOM. List known aliases. For example. “In
     that TECHNICAL SERGEANT ADAM J. SMITH, United States Air Force, then
     MASTER SERGEANT ADAM J. SMITH, alias CAPTAIN JAY J. SMITH, United
     States Air Force, 401st Maintenance Squadron, did, . . .” NOTE: Change the accused’s
     rank from the time of the allegation only if pertinent to the offense charged. RCM
     307(c)(3), Discussion.
     3.4.7.4. Identification of Victim. If the alleged victim is identified in the specification,
     do not put the victim’s name or grade in all capital letters. Do not substitute initials for
     the name of child or sex offense victims, as is required on court-martial orders and the
     Report of Result of Trial. See paragraph 10.7 of this instruction.
     3.4.7.5. Pleading Check Cases. Where a check or other instrument appears regular in all
     respects, the contents need not be pled verbatim. In such cases, consider using the model
     specifications provided in the Military Judges’ Benchbook, DA Pamphlet 27-9 or the
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         35


       sample specifications provided at Figure 3.4. If in doubt, plead the check verbatim, but
       include only the portions applicable at the time of the offense.
3.5. Forwarding Charges (RCM 401). The commander forwards the charges to the convening
authority by attaching an indorsement (Figure 3.6) to the DD Form 458. Attach a personal data
sheet on the accused (Figure 3.7) and a copy of the report of investigation or other evidence
supporting the charges. Documents forwarded should be redacted to remove any Privacy Act
information not relevant to the charges prior to forwarding to the convening authority for
consideration on disposition of the charges. The commander signs and dates the indorsement
when preferring charges or when forwarding charges preferred by another. Address the
indorsement to the officer exercising SPCMCA over the accused. If additional charges are later
added, forward them with a new indorsement.
3.6. Receipt for Charges (RCM 403). A judge advocate may receipt for charges on behalf of
the SPCMCA if the convening authority delegates that authority. If delegated, receive the
charges “FOR THE COMMANDER.”
3.7. Discovery. SJAs and trial counsel are strongly encouraged to provide discovery to defense
counsel as soon as practicable. This may be prior to the preferral of charges.
   3.7.1. At the time charges are preferred, the trial counsel should, as a minimum, provide
   defense counsel the following matters:
       3.7.1.1. A copy of DD Form 458;
       3.7.1.2. A copy of the commander’s indorsement to the DD Form 458 with all
       attachments; and
       3.7.1.3. A copy of any report of investigation and any signed or sworn statements
       relating to the offense charged, unless the government claims that the documents, or
       portions thereof, are protected from release, or disclosure will have an adverse impact on
       an ongoing or proposed law enforcement investigation.
   3.7.2. When stating that certain documents are protected from release, or that certain
   discoverable documents should be redacted before being provided to defense counsel, trial
   counsel should distinguish between rules pertaining to discovery and rules pertaining to the
   release of information to a third party (such as the Freedom of Information Act or Privacy
   Act). Trial counsel should maintain an unredacted copy of any redacted items provided to
   defense in the event unredacted items must later be provided to defense.
       3.7.2.1. Releasing Privacy Act Material to Military Defense Counsel. When releasing
       Privacy Act material to military defense counsel, trial counsel should redact non-
       discoverable Privacy Act information regarding individuals other than the accused. An
       example of this would be social security numbers of individuals providing urinalysis
       samples, which are listed in an otherwise discoverable document, but which have no
       relevance to the case. When Privacy Act material is not redacted in discovery material,
       defense counsel should take appropriate steps to guard against further release of this
       information outside of defense personnel involved in the case.
       3.7.2.2. Releasing Privacy Act Material to Civilian Defense Counsel. When releasing
       Privacy Act material to civilian defense counsel, trial counsel should redact non-
       discoverable Privacy Act information regarding individuals other than the accused. An
 36                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


       example of this would be social security numbers of individuals providing urinalysis
       samples, which are listed in an otherwise discoverable document, but which have no
       relevance to the case. Additionally, when Privacy Act material is not redacted in
       discovery material, trial counsel should obtain a signed statement from the civilian
       defense counsel stating the defense counsel agrees not to release Privacy Act information
       to others not involved with the defense of the case, using the format set forth at Figure
       3.8.
   3.7.3. Defense counsel will be provided the opportunity to inspect items of physical
   evidence upon request and when reasonably available at the time charges are preferred or
   within a reasonable time thereafter.
   3.7.4. Be aware there are special rules with regard to the handling of evidence of child
   pornography. When there is evidence of child pornography refer to 42 U.S.C. § 16911, et
   seq., commonly known as “The Adam Walsh Act” and 18 U.S.C. § 3509, with regard to
   discovery in child pornography cases. Coordinate the review of all evidence of child
   pornography with the AFOSI.
   3.7.5. These provisions are not intended to create any new substantive rights to discovery
   beyond those contained in the Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM). After referral of charges to

1. PRELIMINARY MATTERS. Pursuant to AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice,
Chapter 3, Sections A and B, and R.C.M. 305, I was appointed a (pretrial confinement review
officer)(military magistrate with authority to review pretrial confinement orders) on (date) by
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             39


(name and position of commander). The case of the above named confinee was referred to me
by (name of appropriate commander) at (hours) on (date) at (place). At the beginning of the
hearing, I advised the accused of his/her Article 31 rights, rights to counsel, and rights to make a
statement and present evidence at the hearing.

2. OFFENSES ALLEGED. (Name of Confinee) is alleged to have committed the following
offense(s):

    a. (Summarize each offense. “Legal” language is not necessary, but give the date, place,

of property allegedly stolen or destroyed, or the extent of personal injury allegedly inflicted or
threatened, etc.).

   b. ………………………..

3. ENTRY INTO CONFINEMENT. The confinee was placed into pretrial confinement at
(name and location of confinement facility) on (date), pursuant to the order of (Name, rank and
organization of the member who ordered the confinee into confinement). (Attach the
confinement order to this report).

4. DEFENSE PARTICIPATION. (Name of confinee) and his/her counsel, (Name of
military/civilian counsel), (were) (were not) present during the hearing. (If not present, state why
not). (If present: The confinee and counsel (presented) (did not wish to present) evidence at the

indicate whether the accused or counsel claimed any violations of Articles 12 or 13,
summarizing the evidence and attaching documents related to such matter).

    b. ……………………..

6. FINDINGS: After considering the evidence (summarized above) and the attached
documents, I (do) (do not) find by a preponderance of the evidence that the confinee committed
the offense(s) for which he/she is held. In addition, I (do) (do not) find continued pretrial
confinement is required under the criteria set forth under R.C.M. 305(h)(2)(B) for the following
reasons:
 40                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


    a. (List the factual findings that support your decision. The R.C.M 305(h)(2)(B) criteria,
that must be addressed, are 1) an offense triable by a court-martial has been committed; 2) the
confinee committed it; 3) confinement is necessary because it is foreseeable that: (a) the
confinee will not appear at trial, pretrial hearing, or investigation, or (b) the confinee will
engage in serious criminal misconduct; and, 4) less severe forms of restraint are inadequate.
When conducting your analysis, consider and apply the additional factors enumerated in
paragraph 2.2 of the Pretrial Confinement Guide found on the AFLOA/JAJM website.).

      b. ………………………

7. DECISION. In accordance with the above findings, (name of confinee) will be (continued in
pretrial confinement pending trial) (released from pretrial confinement). (Recommendations for
lesser forms of pretrial restraint, if any, should be addressed in a separate paragraph 8 below -
see Section I, paragraph 2, of the Pretrial Confinement Guide for options).

8. RECOMMENDATION. (If applicable, add this paragraph to set forth your recommendation
and reasons for lesser forms of pretrial restraint).

                                              Chapter 4

                        FORWARDING AND DISPOSITION OF CHARGES

Section 4A—Article 32, UCMJ, Investigations

4.1. Article 32, UCMJ, Investigations (RCM 404(e), 405, 406(b)(2), 601(d)).
      4.1.1. Requirements for an Article 32 Investigation. Before any charge(s) or specification(s)
      may be referred to a GCM for trial, a thorough and impartial investigation into the matters set
      forth in the charge(s) and specification(s) must be made.
      4.1.2. Investigating Officer (IO).
         4.1.2.1. Appointment. The convening authority directs an Article 32 investigation by
         personally appointing the IO in writing. See sample appointment letter at Figure 4.1. All
         documents provided to the IO before the investigation must be listed as attachments. The
         charge sheet and the written evidence, which form the basis for the charge, should be
         attached to the IO Appointment Letter. Normally these documents are the same as those
         attached to the commander’s indorsement to the charge sheet. The IO is not required to
         consider this evidence in the investigation. The IO ensures a copy of the Appointment
         Letter is provided to the accused before the Article 32 investigation begins.
         4.1.2.2. Qualification of the IO. Unless precluded by military necessity or other
         compelling circumstance, the IO should be senior in rank to the accused. An IO must
         either be a designated judge advocate or hold the grade of major or higher. If the IO is
         not a judge advocate, a judge advocate should be appointed to assist the IO. An IO may
         be a reserve judge advocate on active duty or performing inactive duty training. ANG
         judge advocates must be on Title 10 orders to serve as an IO. The accuser may not act as
         IO. The IO must be impartial. Before appointing an officer to serve as an IO, the
         convening authority should consider the appointment in the context of the officer’s
         normally assigned duties and assess whether the IO’s impartiality could be questioned
         based on his/her relationship with the case, the parties, and the base legal office.
      4.1.3. Counsel.
         4.1.3.1. Government Representative. The convening authority may personally detail, or
         authorize the servicing SJA to detail, a government representative as counsel to represent
         the United States. RCM 405(d)(3). Both the detail of a government representative and
         the authorization to allow the SJA to detail a government representative may be verbal or
         in writing.
         4.1.3.2. Counsel for the Accused. The accused is entitled to be represented by military
         defense counsel certified under Article 27(b) and sworn under Article 42(a), UCMJ.
         RCM 405(d)(2). The accused may also be represented by civilian defense counsel;
         however, civilian defense counsel must be provided at no expense to the government.
         RCM 405(d)(2)(C). Civilian defense counsel must take an oath to perform his or her
         duties faithfully when representing an accused. The IO will administer this oath. The
         accused may represent himself/herself, but this right is not absolute. United States v.
         Bramel, 29 M.J. 958 (A.C.M.R.), aff’d, 32 M.J. 3 (C.M.A. 1990).
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                       49


  4.1.4. Delays and Resulting Speedy Trial Issues. The convening authority may approve a
  delay of the Article 32 investigation submitted by either party. The period of time of such
  delay shall be excluded when determining whether the period in RCM 707(a) has run. Prior
  to referral, the convening authority may delegate the authority to grant continuances to an
  Article 32 investigating officer. See RCM 707(a)(1) Discussion. Thus, when an IO has been
  delegated authority to grant delays, the period covered by the delay is excludable from the
  120-day period under RCM 707(c). See also United States v. Lazauskas, 62 M.J. 39
  (C.A.A.F. 2005).
  4.1.5. Preliminary actions by the IO. The IO is responsible for an inquiry into the truth of
  the matter set forth in the charge(s), consideration of the form of the charge(s), and a
  recommendation for a disposition that takes into account the interests of justice and
  discipline. Therefore, the IO must review the charge sheet. The IO should also review the
  evidence which forms the basis for the charge(s), and any other documents attached to the IO
  Appointment Letter. The IO reviews the evidence to ascertain what will be necessary to
  conduct a thorough and impartial investigation. The IO may also contact the government
  representative, if any, and the defense counsel to discuss administrative matters, including
  setting the date and time for the formal hearing.
  4.1.6. Witnesses.
     4.1.6.1. Availability of Witnesses. The IO must determine whether witnesses are
     reasonably available. The “100 miles of the situs” rule found in RCM 405(g)(1)(A) is not
     a per se rule of unavailability. The IO must conduct a balancing test to determine
     reasonable availability. RCM 405(g), Discussion.
     4.1.6.2. Arranging for Witnesses. If the IO considers a witness available, the IO requests
     the witness’ presence. Although the IO may contact witnesses to arrange for their
     presence at the Article 32 investigation, the IO may not discuss the substance of their
     testimony. The IO may delegate to the government representative the responsibility to
     arrange for the presence of witnesses the IO considers reasonably available.
         4.1.6.2.1. Military Witnesses. The IO arranges for the presence of military witnesses
         directly or through the witness’ commander. Before the commander determines a
         military witness is not reasonably available, the commander should consider the
         balancing test factors in RCM 405(g), Discussion, and provide the reasons for his
         decision to the IO, to be included in the IO report. If the commander does not put the
         reasons in writing, the IO must make a memorandum for record detailing the
         commander’s reasons and include it in the report.
         4.1.6.2.2. Civilian Witnesses. The IO may invite civilian witnesses to attend. The
         IO does not generally have subpoena power over persons (See paragraph 6.4).
         Therefore, if the witness refuses to testify, the witness is not reasonably available.
  4.1.7. Conducting the Investigation.
     4.1.7.1. At the beginning of the investigation, the IO must inform the accused of the
     matters in RCM 405(f) and listed on the DD Form 457, Investigating Officer’s Report,
     Item 10.
50                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


     4.1.7.2. IOs should consider all testimony and evidence that is relevant, not cumulative,
     and reasonably available. RCM 405(g)(1). IOs must become familiar with the rules on
     alternatives to testimony and evidence in RCM 405(g)(4) and (5). See RCM
     405(g)(1)(B) and 405(i) (applying MREs to Article 32 investigations).
        4.1.7.2.1. Procedure for Taking Testimony. All testimony, except that of the
        accused, is required to be taken under oath. RCM 405(h)(1)(A), Discussion. The
        accused may make a sworn or unsworn statement. The IO has discretion over the
        manner in which testimony is taken. The IO may personally question witnesses
        and/or allow the government representative to conduct the questioning. The IO must
        allow the defense counsel to question witnesses and should allow the defense wide
        latitude in cross-examination. Keep in mind the application of MRE 303, prohibiting
        degrading questions, and MRE 412, prohibiting questions regarding the alleged
        victim’s past sexual behavior or any perceived predisposition (see paragraph 4.1.7.7
        et al.). An IO who suspects a witness of an offense should advise the witness of his
        or her rights under Article 31, UCMJ.
        4.1.7.2.2. Reducing Testimony to Writing. The IO is responsible for including all
        testimony in the report. Summarized testimony should be written in the first person.
        The witnesses should sign and swear to the truth of their summarized testimony,
        unless this would unduly delay completion of the investigation. If the witness
        reviews and signs the summarized testimony in the United States, use this language
        above the witness’ signature block: “I declare under penalty of perjury that the
        foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date).” If outside the United States, use:
        “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America
        that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date).” 28 U.S.C. § 1746. The
        IO need not be present for a witness to sign their summarized testimony. If the
        witness is not available to sign their summarized testimony, the IO should swear that
        the summary is accurate. The IO should consider, when practicable, giving counsel
        for each side an opportunity to review the summarized testimony prior to providing
        the summarized testimony to the witness for signature.
     4.1.7.3. Reports of Investigation (ROI). AFOSI and Security Forces ROIs contain
     documents that are evidence, alternatives to evidence or alternatives to testimony. RCM
     405(g)(4),(5). For example, a sworn statement by a witness is an alternative to testimony.
     RCM 405(g)(4)(A)(i),(B)(i). The narrative portion of an ROI is usually an “unsworn
     statement describing the evidence” as that term is used in RCM 405(g)(5)(A)(v). Also,
     photographs or photocopies of physical evidence in ROIs are usually unauthenticated
     copies, photographs or reproduction of similar accuracy of the evidence. RCM
     405(g)(5)(A)(ii) and (B)(ii). IOs are discouraged from considering ROIs in their entirety.
     In order to consider an ROI, IOs must look at each part of the ROI and determine whether
     it is evidence or an alternative to testimony. If he or she determines it is evidence or an
     alternative to testimony, the IO must also determine whether the witness or evidence is
     reasonably available and apply the rules in RCM 405(g)(4) and (5). The IO should note
     in the report what parts of the ROI were considered and why. An investigator familiar
     with the matters in the ROI may testify over defense objection about both unavailable
     evidence and his or her participation in the investigation, including relating hearsay.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          51


     RCM 404(g)(5)(B)(i). Witnesses whose statements appear in the ROI may adopt their
     statements as part of their testimony.
     4.1.7.4. Accused’s Statements. An accused is not considered a witness for purposes of
     RCM 405. Therefore, a witness may testify about statements the accused made to the
     witness if relevant, not cumulative and not otherwise prohibited by RCM 405(i).
     Similarly, a written statement by the accused is evidence.
     4.1.7.5. Argument. Because an accused may present anything in defense, extenuation
     and mitigation, and make a statement in any form, the IO may allow the accused or
     counsel, on behalf of the accused, to make a brief argument, if requested. RCM
     405(f)(11), (12).
     4.1.7.6. Objections (RCM 405(h)(2)).
         4.1.7.6.1. The following are potential bases for objections:
             4.1.7.6.1.1. Violations of MRE 301 - 303, 305, 412 and Section V.
             4.1.7.6.1.2. Failure to comply with the procedural requirements of RCM 405.
             4.1.7.6.1.3. A determination that a witness or evidence is not reasonably
             available. RCM 405(g)(2)(D).
         4.1.7.6.2. IOs are required to note objections in their reports. RCM 405(h)(2). The
         IO may require counsel to put objections in writing before noting them in the report.
         The IO may also set a time limit for filing objections.
  4.1.8. Tape Recordings and Verbatim Transcripts. Tape recordings of witness testimony and
  any verbatim transcripts at an Article 32 investigation are permitted only with the advance
  written approval of the SJA for the convening authority that directed the investigation. When
  considering such requests, SJAs should consider the likelihood the witness will be
  unavailable or refuse to testify at a later trial, whether the testimony of an important witness
  is best evaluated by reviewing the verbatim testimony, and the discovery interest of the
  accused. Court reporter availability or non-availability is not a proper consideration and
  cannot be the basis for denial of this request. If approved, all tape recordings or stenographic
  notes, which could be subject to release under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, or RCM
  914, must be retained by the servicing SJA’s office until the case is completed.
  4.1.9. Open Proceedings. Ordinarily, Article 32 investigations are open to the public. All
  efforts to keep the investigation open should be explored before closing the investigation.
  See San Antonio Express News v. Morrow, 44 M.J. 706 (A.F. Ct. of Crim. App. 1996).
     4.1.9.1. Closing the Proceedings. Access by spectators to all or part of the proceeding
     may be restricted or foreclosed at the discretion of the convening authority that directed
     the investigation or the IO. Article 32 investigations are public hearings and should
     remain open to the public whenever possible. When an overriding interest exists that
     outweighs the value of an open investigation, the hearing may be closed to spectators.
     Any closure must be narrowly tailored to achieve the overriding interest that justified the
     closure. RCM 405(h)(3). The convening authority directing the investigation may retain
     sole authority over a decision to open or close an Article 32 investigation by giving the
     IO procedural instructions at the time of appointment or at any time thereafter. RCM
     405(c).
52                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


         4.1.9.1.1. Specific Reasons. If the hearing is closed, the convening authority or IO
         ordering it closed should articulate specific, substantial reasons, in writing, for
         closure. These reasons should be attached to the IO’s report of investigation. Such
         reasons ordinarily will be only those circumstances under which a court-martial may
         be closed. MRE 412(c) (evidence of a victim’s prior sexual conduct); MRE 505
         (classified information); MRE 506 (government privilege). RCM 405(h)(3). Make
         every effort to close only those portions of the investigation that are clearly justified
         and keep the remaining portions of the investigation open.
         4.1.9.1.2. Reopening a Closed Investigation. A convening authority may open an
         Article 32 investigation an IO has closed. Prior to issuing procedural instructions to
         reopen an investigation, the convening authority must consider the IO’s written
         reasons for closing the investigation.
     4.1.9.2. Potential Witnesses.      It is within the IO’s discretion to exclude potential
     witnesses.
  4.1.10. Media. See Section 13D for issues dealing with the news media.
  4.1.11. Investigating Uncharged Misconduct. If evidence received at an Article 32
  investigation indicates the accused committed uncharged misconduct, the IO may investigate
  the subject matter of such offense and make a recommendation as to its disposition prior to
  preferral of charges on that offense. The IO should ensure the accused is present at the
  investigation, is informed of the nature of each uncharged offense investigated, and is
  afforded the right to counsel, cross-examination and presentation of evidence. The IO will
  identify compliance with the guidance in this paragraph in the IO’s Report of Investigation.
  If the uncharged misconduct is subsequently charged, consult RCM 405(b) as to the need for
  further investigation. Article 32(d), UCMJ.
 4.1.12. Drafting the IO’s Report of Investigation. The IO prepares a report using DD Form
 457, Investigating Officer’s Report, with supplemental pages, if necessary. See RCM
 405(j)(2) and MCM, Appendix 5, for what must be included in the IO report. The report
 must clearly state what evidence the IO considered. The standard of proof is whether
 reasonable grounds exist to believe that the accused committed the offense(s) alleged, not
 whether the government has presented a prima facie case. RCM 405(j)(2)(H). Reasonable
 grounds exist when the evidence convinces a reasonable, prudent person there is probable
 cause to believe a crime was committed and the accused committed it. A finding that
 reasonable grounds exist does not require a recommendation of trial by court-martial.
  4.1.13. Assembly of the IO Report.
     4.1.13.1. The IO report is the first attachment to the IO Appointment Letter.
     4.1.13.2. The IO report includes the DD Form 457, its supplemental pages, and exhibits.
     Exhibits include the charge sheet, summarized or verbatim testimony, and other evidence,
     whether or not considered.
  4.1.14. Distribution of the Report.
     4.1.14.1. The IO should deliver the report through the convening authority’s SJA to the
     convening authority who directed the Article 32 investigation. The SJA ensures
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          53


      photocopies of the report are made and delivered to the convening authority. The process
      should be described in the IO Appointment Letter. RCM 405(j)(3).
      4.1.14.2. The convening authority that directed the investigation, or the SJA on behalf of
      the convening authority, shall promptly cause a copy of the report to be served on both
      the accused and accused’s counsel. RCM 405(j)(3). Upon delivery, the accused and the
      accused’s counsel shall sign receipts of service, showing the date and time of service.
      Append the receipts as attachments to the IO Appointment Letter.
   4.1.15. Objections to the IO Report. Any objections to the report must be submitted to the
   convening authority that directed the investigation within 5 days of receipt of the report by
   the accused and counsel, whichever is later. The day the report is delivered is not counted in
   calculating the 5-day period. RCM 103(9); 405(j)(4). The convening authority, upon
   receipt, may direct the investigation be reopened or take other action, as appropriate.
   However, this does not prohibit a convening authority from referring charges to trial or
   taking other action within the 5-day period. RCM 405(j)(4).
      4.1.15.1. If timely objections are received after the convening authority has taken action
      on the report, the convening authority may reconsider the prior action taken in light of the
      objections received. If the report has been forwarded to a superior court-martial
      convening authority for disposition in accordance with paragraph 4.1.16 below, forward
      the objections to that convening authority by the most expeditious means so that the
      objections may receive appropriate consideration.
      4.1.15.2. Objections not received in a timely manner are waived. However, relief from
      the waiver may be granted for good cause shown. RCM 405(k).
      4.1.15.3. Append objections as attachments to the IO Appointment Letter.
   4.1.16. Forwarding the Article 32 Report of Investigation to a Superior Convening
   Authority. If the convening authority who directed the investigation decides to forward the
   Article 32 report to a superior court-martial convening authority for disposition, the
   convening authority who directed the investigation prepares a forwarding letter which
   includes a recommendation for disposition of the charges. This letter is forwarded to the
   superior court-martial convening authority, through the superior convening authority’s SJA,
   and must include the following documents as attachments:
      4.1.16.1. The Charge Sheet,
      4.1.16.2. The commander’s indorsement to the charge sheet, and
      4.1.16.3. The IO Appointment Letter with attachments (including the IO Report, accused
      and defense counsel receipts and any objections).
   4.1.17. If the superior convening authority needs to detail members to a court-martial to try
   the case, forward a list of court member nominees with Credit data. United States v. Credit,
   2 M.J. 631 (A.F.C.M.R. 1976); RCM 912. A list of court member nominees may not be
   required if the case will ultimately be referred to a court-martial previously impaneled to try
   cases (i.e., a standing panel to try cases that may arise in a specified period).

Section 4B—Courts of Inquiry
 54                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


4.2. Courts of Inquiry (Article 135, UCMJ; MCM, Part I, Para. 2(b)(3)).
   4.2.1. General. A court of inquiry is one of several investigative methods available to
   ascertain the facts of a matter of importance to the Air Force. Only a GCMCA may convene
   a court of inquiry. Do not use a court of inquiry when statute or regulation otherwise
   provides specific investigative procedures for a matter. Do not use a court of inquiry in place
   of an Article 32 investigation, unless deemed necessary to produce evidence not otherwise
   reasonably available. If, however, a court of inquiry previously investigated the subject
   matter of an offense, and the requirements of RCM 405(b) are met, an Article 32
   investigation may not be necessary.
   4.2.2. Members of the Court of Inquiry. A court of inquiry shall consist of three or more
   commissioned officers. The senior member is the president. All members should be senior
   to any person whose conduct is the subject of an inquiry.
   4.2.3. Counsel for the Court of Inquiry. The convening authority appoints a judge advocate
   certified under Article 27(b), UCMJ, as legal advisor for the court of inquiry. The counsel
   assists the court of inquiry in matters of law, presenting evidence and keeping the record.
   4.2.4. Party to the Court of Inquiry. Designate any person subject to the UCMJ whose
   conduct is subject to inquiry as a party to the court of inquiry. Any person designated as a
   party shall be given due notice and has the right to be present, to be represented by counsel,
   to cross-examine witnesses and to introduce evidence.
   4.2.5. Counsel for Parties. A party to the court of inquiry is entitled to representation by a
   defense counsel certified under Article 27(b), UCMJ. A party may request individual
   military defense counsel, subject to the rules of reasonable availability applicable to trials by
   court-martial. Any party may retain a civilian counsel at no expense to the government. See
   paragraph 5.3.
   4.2.6. Convening Order. Use the sample format in Figure 4.2 to convene a court of inquiry.
   The order appoints the members and counsel for the court of inquiry, states the subject of
   inquiry, designates known parties, and directs a report of findings of facts on the issues
   involved. If the convening authority desires conclusions and recommendations, include this
   in the order. The convening order should set the time and place of the court of inquiry. The
   convening order is provided to the parties and counsel.
   4.2.7. Reporters. A qualified court reporter records the proceedings and testimony, and
   prepares a record of the proceedings for authentication by the president. If the record of the
   proceedings is to be used as a substitute for an Article 32 investigation, it must comply with
   the requirements of RCM 405(j). See also AFMAN 51-203, paragraph 16.13.5.
   4.2.8. Challenges. Members of a court of inquiry may be challenged by a party, but only for
   cause stated to the court. The president of the court, with advice from the counsel for the
   court of inquiry, rules on challenges.
   4.2.9. Oaths. The members, counsel, reporter and interpreter take an oath or affirmation to
   faithfully perform their duties. Article 135(e), UCMJ. The president or counsel for the court
   of inquiry may administer oaths. Article 136, UCMJ.
   4.2.10. Procedures and Rules of Evidence. The rules of evidence and procedure that apply
   to an Article 32 investigation apply to a court of inquiry.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                              55


   4.2.11. Witnesses. The president of the court may issue subpoenas for civilian witnesses.
   RCM 703(e)(2)(C). All witnesses testifying before a court of inquiry do so under oath or
   affirmation. Members of the court of inquiry, the counsel to the court of inquiry and the
   counsel to a party may examine all witnesses. A party cannot be compelled to testify, but
   may testify under oath subject to cross-examination or make an unsworn statement.
   4.2.12. Written Report by the Court of Inquiry. The court of inquiry makes findings of fact,
   but may not make conclusions and recommendations, unless required to do so by the
   convening authority. Dissenting views are authorized.
   4.2.13. Record of the Court of Inquiry. Each court shall keep a record of its proceedings.
   Authenticate the record in accordance with Article 135(h), UCMJ. The president forwards
   the authenticated record to the convening authority, who obtains a legal review from the
   servicing SJA. The legal review includes a summary of the proceedings, a determination of
   the legal sufficiency of the proceedings, and a recommended action.
   4.2.14. Revision. The convening authority may reconvene the court of inquiry and direct it
   to take additional action the convening authority deems necessary.

Section 4C—Depositions (RCM 702)

4.3. Counsel. The rules governing qualification of counsel who may perform duties before
courts-martial apply to counsel representing the parties at a deposition. The deposition should
affirmatively indicate the qualifications of counsel. See Figure 4.4.
4.4. Recording and Authentication.
   4.4.1. Written Depositions.    Record and authenticate depositions taken on written
   interrogatories using a DD Form 456, Interrogatories and Depositions. Do not use the DD
   Form 456 for oral depositions.
   4.4.2. Oral Deposition. Conduct oral depositions in accordance with the procedures in RCM
   702(g)(1). Figure 4.4 provides a sample format for conducting and transcribing the
   proceeding. Record and transcribe oral depositions verbatim, noting the times and dates of
   the opening, closing, recesses and adjournment. An oral deposition may be recorded by a
   reporter or other means, including videotape. RCM 702(g)(3). The deposition officer is the
   custodian for the record of deposition.
       4.4.2.1. If the deposition is recorded, the transcriber shall certify the transcription is true
       and accurate. See Figure 4.5. The deposition officer must authenticate the record of
       deposition. See Figure 4.6. The certification and authentication shall be the last pages of
       the deposition.
       4.4.2.2. For depositions recorded by other means, a written transcript is not required
       unless the convening authority or military judge directs one. RCM 702(g)(3). However,
       the record of deposition, whether it is a videotape, audiotape or sound film, must still be
       authenticated by the deposition officer. The authentication is attached to the recording.
       A sample format for the authentication of a videotaped deposition is at Figure 4.7.

Section 4D—Referral and Disposition

4.5. Pretrial Advice (Article 34, UCMJ; RCM 406).
   4.5.1. SJA’s Advice. A person other than the SJA may prepare the advice, but the SJA is,
   unless disqualified, responsible for it and must personally sign it. An assistant performing
   the duties of the SJA, in the absence of, or because of the disqualification of the SJA, signs
   “Acting as the Staff Judge Advocate.” The SJA’s advice is required for all GCMs and is
   optional for SPCMs and SCMs.
   4.5.2. Mandatory Contents. The pretrial advice must include the conclusions and
   recommendation enumerated in RCM 406(b). The pretrial advice must also address the
   following matters, when applicable:
       4.5.2.1. Capital Cases. In a case referred as capital, the pretrial advice must specify the
       aggravating circumstances relied upon and provide the convening authority with
       conclusions as to whether capital referral is warranted based on the analysis as set forth in
       RCM 1004(b)(4). In a case where the death penalty is authorized, but not mandatory, and
       the convening authority decides to refer the case as capital, the referral should include
       special instructions stating the case is to be tried as a capital case. RCM 201(f)(1)(A)(iii);
       RCM 1004(b)(1)(A).
   4.5.3. Format and Length. Pretrial advice need not contain any underlying analysis or
   rationale for the conclusions contained in it. In addition, lengthy summaries of evidence,
   detailed explanations of elements of offenses, and extensive discussions of possible defenses
   are not required. See sample format for pretrial advice at Figure 4.8.
4.6. Forwarding of Pretrial Advice. The charge sheet, the commander’s indorsement,
forwarding letters or other indorsements, and, if applicable, the investigating officer’s
appointment letter with attachments (including the report of investigation, receipts of report and
any objections) should be forwarded with the pretrial advice to the convening authority. If the
Article 32 investigation is waived, forward the accused’s waiver. If an Article 32 investigation is
not conducted, forward the documentary evidence that the SJA relied upon to conclude the
charges and specifications are warranted, such as investigative reports, witness statements and
other documents containing relevant information. If the convening authority needs to detail
members to a court-martial to try the forwarded case, forward appropriate documentation for
court-member selection. See paragraph 4.1.17.
4.7. Referral of Charges to Courts-Martial (RCM 601). The convening authority must sign
either the referral section on the DD Form 458, Charge Sheet, or another document reflecting the
intention to refer charges to trial. Such other documents may include concurrence with an SJA’s
pretrial advice recommendation to refer the case to trial by a specified court-martial.
   4.7.1. Completing the Referral Block on Charge Sheet. The designation of the convening
   authority on the charge sheet should be the same as on the convening order. Use the date the
   convening authority referred the charges. If the convening authority personally signs the
   referral, strike out “by ... Command or Order … of...,” and include the convening authority’s
   signature block. If the convening authority delegated authority to sign the referral block on
   the charge sheet to a judge advocate, the judge advocate signs the referral “FOR THE
   COMMANDER.”
       4.7.1.1. Include special instructions in the referral block when appropriate. RCM 601(e).
       For example, when additional charges are referred, include the following: “To be tried
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            57


       with the original (charge) (charges), dated [date of preferral of original charge(s)].” Also,
       when a case is referred as a capital case, include the following: “To be tried as a capital
       case.”
       4.7.1.2. The SPCMCA SJA must have the accused’s records examined to ascertain the
       accused’s nationality no later than twenty four hours after referral, even if a claim of
       foreign nationality has not been made. See paragraph 13.10.3. Comply with the
       reporting requirements of paragraph 13.10.1.
   4.7.2. Dismissing Charges (RCM 401(c)(1)). If the convening authority determines some of
   the charges and/or specifications will be dismissed instead of referred to court-martial, the
   dismissed charges and/or specifications should be lined out, and the dismissal dated and
   initialed (e.g., “Dismissed on 15 Sep 11, [initials]”). This may be accomplished by the
   convening authority, a judge advocate authorized to sign referrals on the convening
   authority’s behalf, or the trial counsel at the direction of the convening authority. The
   remaining charges should be renumbered if necessary. If no charges remain, the referral
   must be withdrawn. See paragraph 8.2.
   4.7.3. Disqualification of Convening Authority (RCM 601(c)). An accuser may not refer
   charges to a general or special court-martial. Further, a convening authority is disqualified if
   he or she has “an interest other than an official interest in the prosecution of the accused.”
   Article 1(9), UCMJ.
       4.7.3.1. If the SPCMCA is disqualified, forward the case to the GCMCA. If the
       GCMCA is disqualified, the MAJCOM commander determines who shall act as the
       GCMCA. If there is not an appropriate commander exercising GCMCA within the
       command, the MAJCOM SJA requests AFLOA/JAJM assistance in the designation of a
       commander to serve as the GCMCA.
4.8. Withdrawing Referred Charges (RCM 604). Reference paragraph 8.2 for withdrawing
referred charges.
4.9. Re-referring Charges. After charges have been referred to trial, it may become necessary
to refer them again on the same charge sheet. Use the following procedures for re-referring
charges in rehearings and other cases, including withdrawn charges:
   4.9.1. New Referral. The new referral must be documented in the same format as that on
   page 2 of the charge sheet, following the rules in paragraph 4.7. The new referral may be
   accomplished by typing the appropriate language on bond paper or by using the referral
   section from page 2 of another DD Form 458. When completed, cut out and attach the new
   referral section to the charge sheet by stapling it immediately above the original referral
   section. Never remove or obliterate a prior referral. If a third or subsequent referral is
   necessary, attach it in the same way as the second.
   4.9.2. Special Instructions for Rehearings. When a case has been referred for a rehearing
   (whether in full, for a limited purpose, or for a new trial), incorporate the appropriate
   instructions in the referral section. RCM 810. For example, in a rehearing on sentence only,
   include the special instruction: “For a rehearing on sentence only, as ordered by General
   Court-Martial Order No. 17, Headquarters, 18 AF, dated 4 June 2011, as to the charge and
   specification of which the accused was found guilty and affirmed by the Air Force Court of
   Criminal Appeals’ decision, dated 10 May 2011,” or a similar instruction.
 58                                                                         AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


4.10. Notification of Referral of Later Charges in Pending Cases.
      4.10.1. Notify AFLOA/JAJM. If charges are referred to trial against a person who is the
      accused in a case under review under Articles 66, 67, 67a or 69, UCMJ, the headquarters
      referring the new charges to trial must notify AFLOA/JAJM by the most expeditious means
      available (e.g., facsimile or e-mail). Identify the case currently under review by providing
      the accused’s full name, rank, and social security number, along with the case’s ACM (the
      number assigned by AFLOA/JAJM Appellate Records), if available. Also provide the nature
      of the new charges, including the date referred, type of court-martial, anticipated date of trial,
      a brief statement of facts of the case, and any other information which might affect
      disposition of the current review concerning the case.
      4.10.2. Follow-Up Messages. Send follow-up messages to advise when trial is completed
      (including the result), if the charges are withdrawn, or if there are other significant
      developments which may affect disposition of the case currently under review.
4.11. Arraignment and Pleas at Article 39(a) Session. When a UCMJ, Article 39(a) session is
conducted by the military judge before assembly, the arraignment may be held and the plea of
the accused may be accepted at that time by the military judge. In addition, the military judge
may enter findings of guilty on an accepted plea of guilty at that time.
4.12. Docketing. USAF/JAT shall establish docketing procedures. Rules 2.1 through 2.5 of the
Uniform Rules of Practice Before Air Force Courts-Martial (Attachment 4) contain current
docketing procedures.

MEMORANDUM FOR ______/CC

FROM: ______/JA

SUBJECT: Pretrial Advice – United States v. Rank and Name, (SSN), Unit and Base

1. The accused is charged with three specifications of making 19 worthless checks with the
intent to defraud, in violation of Article 123a, UCMJ. (The charge was preferred on 15 May
2011, investigated under Article 32, UCMJ, on 16 and 17 May 2011, and forwarded by the
investigating officer on 22 May 2011 with a recommendation for referral to trial by general
court-martial.) OR (The charge was preferred on 15 May 2011. On 25 May 2011, the accused
 64                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


submitted a waiver to his/her right to an investigation under Article 32, UCMJ.) The commander
(SPCMCA) forwarded the charge on 2 June 2011 with a recommendation for trial by general
court-martial.

2. Pursuant to Rule for Court-Martial 406 and Article 34, UCMJ, I provide you the following
advice:

    a. The charge and specifications are generally in proper form. [If applicable, add the
following for minor amendments: A minor amendment to specification 2 should be made:

       The specification should be amended at check 147 to reflect, “pay to the order of
       AFO-147,” vice “Air Force Commissary.”]

   b. The charge and specifications [if applicable, insert: “as amended,”] (allege offenses under
the UCMJ).

   c. The charge and specifications are warranted by the evidence contained in the [(Article 32
report) (documents listed below as attachments)].

  d. The accused is on active duty in the United States Air Force. I am satisfied a court-martial
would have jurisdiction over the accused and the offenses charged.

       [NOTE: If applicable, include information on an accused’s outstanding combat or
overseas record and, in capital cases, address aggravating circumstances. See paragraph 4.5.2.]

3. I recommend you refer the charge and specifications (if applicable, insert: “as amended,”) to
trial by general court-martial.

     COURT-MARTIAL COMPOSITION AND PERSONNEL, REPORTERS, AND
                   CONVENING COURTS-MARTIAL

Section 5A—Composition and Personnel

5.1. Detail of Military Judges (RCM 503(b)).
   5.1.1. Chief Trial Judge. The Judge Advocate General’s designee for detail of military
   judges to courts-martial within the Air Force is the Chief Trial Judge, USAF Trial Judiciary
   HQ USAF/JAT.
   5.1.2. Detailing Military Judges. The Chief Trial Judge, USAF Trial Judiciary, details
   military judges to SPCMs and GCMs. The Chief Trial Judge may delegate this authority to
   any person assigned as an Air Force military judge. A military judge with the authority to
   detail military judges may detail himself or herself as military judge to a court-martial.
   Orders detailing military judges may be oral or written. Include written orders, if any, in the
   ROT. Announce on the Record the authority detailing the military judge.
      5.1.2.1. A military judge from another U.S. Armed Force may be detailed to Air Force
      courts-martial according to the other Armed Force’s regulations applicable to military
      judges and with the approval of TJAG.
      5.1.2.2. TJAG has authority to make Air Force military judges available for detail to
      trials convened by another U.S. Armed Force.
5.2. Summary Court-Martial (SCM) (RCM 1301; 1302).
   5.2.1. Detailing SCMs. A SCM is detailed by a convening order. The convening order is a
   special order prepared in accordance with RCM 504(d) signed by the convening authority.
   For qualifications of a SCM, see RCM 1301(a). See sample summary courts-martial
   convening order at Figure 5.4.
      5.2.1.1. All summary courts-martial are constituted by special orders that are numbered
      consecutively on a fiscal year basis, starting with the number 1, and using an AC-series
      letter prefix (see paragraph 5.11.2).
      5.2.1.2. When generating the convening order, use the following single paragraph as a
      model for the convening authority’s signature in an appropriately formatted AC-series
      special order: “Pursuant to authority contained in Special Order A-###, Department of
      the Air Force, dated, _____, a summary court is hereby convened. I have reviewed the
      charge sheet and evidence in the case of United States v. John H. Doe. It may proceed at
      Vandenberg AFB, California, to try such persons as may be properly brought before it.
      Lt Col Will I. Judge, 30 SW/DO, is detailed as the summary court-martial officer. Using
      a separate order still requires Block 14 of the charge sheet to be completed and signed by
      the convening authority or properly designated judge advocate per paragraph 4.7.1. (See
      paragraphs 5.11.1 and 5.11.2 for format and additional content.)
   5.2.2. Reservists as SCMs. A reservist on active duty who is a commissioned officer may
   serve as an SCM under RCM 1301. Reservists on inactive duty for training (IDTs) are not
 66                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


      on active duty and cannot serve as an SCM. ANG officers who are serving on active duty in
      federal service may serve as SCMs under RCM 1301.
      5.2.3. Selection of Officers. The SCM must be impartial. Before appointing an officer to
      serve as a SCM, the convening authority should consider the appointment in the context of
      the officer’s normally assigned duties and assess whether the SCM’s impartiality could be
      questioned based on his or her relationship with the case, the parties, and the base legal
      office.
5.3. Detail of Counsel (RCM 503(c)).
      5.3.1. Procedure.
         5.3.1.1. The Chief, Trial Defense Division has the authority to detail a Chief Senior
         Defense Counsel (CSDC), Senior Defense Counsel (SDC), or Area Defense Counsel
         (ADC) to any court-martial and may delegate such authority as prescribed in the Military
         Defense Counsel Charter.
         5.3.1.2. When requested by the SDC in the region where a court-martial is to be held, the
         SDC may detail an ADC from a base within that SDC’s region as defense counsel to a
         court-martial outside that region, with the concurrence of the Chief, Trial Defense
         Division, or a CSDC.
         5.3.1.3. A CSDC may detail any ADC or SDC as defense counsel to any court-martial.
         The Chief, Trial Defense Division, retains the authority to override such detailing
         decisions.
         5.3.1.4. The Chief, Trial Defense Division, may detail any ADC, SDC, or CSDC as
         defense counsel to any court-martial.
         5.3.1.5. An SJA, Chief Senior Trial Counsel (CSTC), Senior Trial Counsel (STC), or the
         Chief or Deputy Chief, Government Trial and Appellate Counsel Division
         (AFLOA/JAJG), may detail trial counsel or assistant trial counsel to any court-martial.
         The order detailing trial counsel may be oral, written, or in message form. Announce
         orders detailing counsel orally on the record at trial. Attach written or message orders, if
         any, to the ROT.
         5.3.1.6. RCM 503(c)(3) and other Armed Forces’ regulations govern detailing counsel
         from other Armed Forces to Air Force courts-martial.
         5.3.1.7. The Chief, Military Justice Division (AFLOA/JAJM), is TJAG’s designee with
         authority to make Air Force counsel, with the exception of those assigned to
         AFLOA/JAJD, available for detail to trials convened by another Armed Force.
         AFLOA/JAJD exercises this authority over ADCs and SDCs.
      5.3.2. Qualifications.
         5.3.2.1. General Court-Martial. Attorneys detailed as trial counsel, defense counsel, or
         associate defense counsel for a GCM must be certified according to Article 27(b), UCMJ,
         and AFI 51-103, Designation and Certification of Judge Advocates. Any person detailed
         as assistant trial counsel or assistant defense counsel must be designated as a judge
         advocate under 10 U.S.C. § 8067(g) and AFI 51-103. If the trial counsel is qualified to
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           67


       act as counsel before a GCM, the defense counsel must be a person similarly qualified.
       Article 27(c)(2), UCMJ.
       5.3.2.2. Special Court-Martial. Attorneys detailed as defense counsel for a SPCM must
       be certified according to Article 27(b), UCMJ and AFI 51-103. Any person detailed as
       trial counsel, assistant trial counsel, or assistant defense counsel for a SPCM must be
       designated as a judge advocate under 10 U.S.C. § 8067(g) and AFI 51-103.
          5.3.2.2.1. If, because of physical conditions or military exigencies, an accused is not
          afforded the opportunity to be represented by defense counsel certified according to
          Article 27(b), UCMJ, the convening authority must make a detailed written statement,
          to be included in the ROT, stating why counsel with such qualifications could not be
          obtained. Article 27(c)(1), UCMJ.
       5.3.2.3. Summary Court-Martial. An accused facing trial by SCM may request
       representation by a military defense counsel, but is not entitled to military defense
       counsel certified according to Article 27(b), UCMJ. RCM 1301(e). Civilian counsel
       provided by the accused and qualified under RCM 502(d)(3) shall be permitted to
       represent the accused at the summary court-martial if such appearance will not
       unreasonably delay the proceedings and if military exigencies do not preclude it. RCM
       1301(e). An attorney who has been designated a judge advocate under 10 U.S.C.
       §8067(g) and AFI 51-103 may be detailed to represent the Government.
       5.3.2.4. Air Reserve Component Members. The requirements of certification and
       designation set out in 5.3.2.1 through 5.3.2.3 apply to reserve component judge
       advocates. Only those reservists assigned as senior trial or senior defense counsel may be
       certified annually. Other reserve component judge advocates are certified according to
       AFI 51-103. Reserve component judge advocates must be on active duty or performing
       inactive duty training to be detailed as trial counsel or military defense counsel, and they
       must be in Title 10 status at all times when performing trial duties. See paragraph 5.4.5
       for guidance on reserve component judge advocates performing individual military
       defense counsel (IMDC) duties.
       5.3.2.5. Civilian Counsel (RCM 502(d)(3)). When a civilian counsel represents an
       accused at a court-martial, include the counsel’s qualifications to serve as defense
       counsel on the record. Include information about the civilian counsel’s bar membership
       and standing.
   5.3.3. Disqualifications (Articles 26(d) and 27(a), UCMJ; RCM 502(d)(4)). An IO for an
   Article 32, UCMJ, investigation may never serve as a member of the prosecution or as
   military judge in the same case. A judge advocate who served as the accuser or IO for the
   Article 32, UCMJ, investigation cannot perform any other duty in connection with the trial of
   the same case, except as defense counsel at the specific request of an accused after being
   fully informed of the individual’s prior involvement in the case.
5.4. Requests for Individual Military Defense Counsel (RCM 502(d)(3) and 506(b)). An
accused may request representation by an IMDC in an Article 32 investigation or at a court-
martial. The requested counsel represents the accused, if reasonably available. The right to
request an IMDC does not extend to representation for actions under Article 15, UCMJ.
68                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


     5.4.1. Format of IMDC Requests. An IMDC request must be in writing and signed by the
     accused or detailed counsel and shall include the following, as applicable:
        5.4.1.1. The date of the Article 32 investigation or trial;
        5.4.1.2. Any special qualifications of the requested counsel relevant to the case;
        5.4.1.3. Whether the accused is represented by other counsel (not the requested counsel)
        and, if so, the name of that counsel;
        5.4.1.4. Whether the accused has entered into an attorney-client relationship with the
        requested counsel concerning the charges being investigated or tried, (including any
        statement required by 5.4.4);
        5.4.1.5. In the case of a requested counsel presently unavailable, whether the counsel is
        expected to be available before the Article 32 investigation or trial; and,
        5.4.1.6. A statement acknowledging the accused’s understanding that, if the IMDC
        request is granted, the detailed defense counsel may be excused from further participation
        in the case at the sole discretion of the detailing authority.
  5.4.2. Non-Availability of Certain Counsel. In addition to those persons listed in RCM
  506(b)(1), the following persons are not ordinarily reasonably available to serve as IMDC
  because of the nature of their duties, positions, or geographic locations:
        5.4.2.1. Medical Legal Consultants and Advisors;
        5.4.2.2. Attorneys in the National Capital Region assigned to the Air Force Legal
        Operations Agency, excluding any individual detailed to perform duties as a SDC or
        ADC;
        5.4.2.3. Attorneys attending an Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) sponsored
        program such as an LL.M (Master of Laws) program;
        5.4.2.4. Attorneys assigned or attached to the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
        (AFOSI);
        5.4.2.5. Attorneys detailed to perform duties as a STC. Detailed trial and assistant trial
        counsel in the same or an allied case;
        5.4.2.6. Staff Judge Advocates, and for commands having a GCMCA, Deputy Staff
        Judge Advocates.
 5.4.3. Reasonably Available. A counsel is “reasonably available” if not considered
 unavailable by the terms of the MCM or this instruction, and the appropriate approval
 authority determines the requested counsel can perform the duties of IMDC without
 unreasonable expense or detriment to the United States and without unreasonable delay in the
 proceedings. In determining the reasonable availability of a counsel, the approval authority
 may consider the following:
        5.4.3.1. The duties, workload, and assignment status of the requested counsel;
        5.4.3.2. The experience level, duties, and workload of the military counsel already
        detailed to represent the accused;
        5.4.3.3. The nature and complexity of the charges and legal issues involved in the case;
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                        69


     5.4.3.4. Whether a certified assistant trial counsel is detailed to the case;
     5.4.3.5. The workload of the office to which the requested counsel is assigned and the
     availability of personnel to meet those demands;
     5.4.3.6. The distance from the expected site of the proceedings; and
     5.4.3.7. Whether requested counsel is likely to be a necessary witness at trial or is
     otherwise conflicted from representing the accused under the Air Force Rules of
     Professional Conduct or Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice.
  5.4.4. Exception: Attorney-Client Relationship. When an attorney-client relationship exists,
  as determined by the approval authority, exceptions to non-availability based upon
  assignment to a position identified in RCM 506(b)(1) and paragraph 5.4.2 should ordinarily
  be granted. An attorney-client relationship exists when, at the time of the accused’s IMDC
  request, the accused and the requested attorney had a bilateral understanding as to the nature
  of services to be provided in the case, and the requested attorney was actively engaged in the
  preparation and pretrial strategy of the case. United States v. Spriggs, 52 M.J. 235 (C.A.A.F.
  2000). A statement claiming the attorney-client relationship signed by the requested attorney
  and accused must accompany the IMDC request (see paragraph 5.4.1.4). The statement must
  provide an overview of the relationship.
  5.4.5. IMDC Requests for Air Reserve Component (ARC) Attorneys. Only ARC attorneys
  on extended Title 10 active duty tours can be requested. The reasonable availability of ARC
  attorneys is assessed in the context of RCM 506(b)(1) and paragraph 5.4.2; i.e., the
  restrictions apply to the active and reserve components alike. ARC attorneys must be in Title
  10 status at all times when performing as an IMDC. Requests for ARC attorneys are
  processed IAW paragraph 5.4.7.
  5.4.6. Processing IMDC Requests for ADCs and SDCs.
     5.4.6.1. IMDC requests for ADCs and SDCs are forwarded through defense channels to
     the appropriate approval authority as follows:
         5.4.6.1.1. The Chief, Trial Defense Division has the authority to act on any IMDC
         request for any CSDCs, SDCs, or ADCs and may delegate such authority as
         prescribed in the Military Defense Counsel Charter.
         5.4.6.1.2. The Chief, Trial Defense Division, or a CSDC determines the availability
         of SDCs and takes action on IMDC requests for SDCs. However, the Chief, Trial
         Defense Division, may override a CSDC’s decision to grant an IMDC request.
         5.4.6.1.3. The Chief, Trial Defense Division, determines the availability of a CSDC
         and takes action on IMDC requests for the CSDC.
     5.4.6.2. An accused may appeal the disapproval of an IMDC request to the Chief, Trial
     Defense Division, whose decision is final. There is no appeal from an IMDC request
     initially disapproved by the Chief, Trial Defense Division.
  5.4.7. Processing IMDC Requests for Other Counsel. IMDC requests for all other counsel
  (not addressed in paragraph 5.4.6.) are forwarded to the convening authority through the trial
  counsel, if any. RCM 506(b)(2). Because the Trial Defense Division is responsible for
  defense services throughout the Air Force, it is incumbent upon those IMDCs who are not
70                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


     assigned to JAJD to notify the Chief, Trial Defense Division, of their association with a case
     as soon as practicable. These IMDCs should also keep the regional SDC informed about the
     progress of the case. Additionally, the IMDC must coordinate in advance any anticipated
     expenditure of JAJD funds for travel or other reasons.
        5.4.7.1. Disposition when Counsel is Not Reasonably Available. If the requested
        counsel is not reasonably available for a reason identified in RCM 506(b)(1) or paragraph
        5.4.2, and the accused does not assert an attorney-client relationship, the convening
        authority denies the request and notifies the accused.
        5.4.7.2. Disposition when Counsel May Be Available. If the requested counsel appears
        to be reasonably available (i.e., not apparently unavailable IAW RCM 506(b)(1) or
        paragraph 5.4.2), the convening authority forwards the request to the appropriate
        approving authority identified below. The approving authority evaluates availability (see
        paragraph 5.4.3), decides whether to grant the request, and informs the forwarding
        convening authority of the decision and the reasons for the decision. The convening
        authority notifies the accused of the decision.
            5.4.7.2.1. Attorneys Assigned to AFLOA or HQ Air Force. Send requests for
            attorneys in the Civil Law and Litigation Directorate (AFLOA/JAC), Air Force
            Judiciary Directorate (AFLOA/JAJ), Legal Information Services Directorate
            (AFLOA/JAS), AFJAGS or HQ Air Force directorates to the respective director or
            division chief. Requests for ADCs and SDCs shall be forwarded in accordance with
            paragraph 5.4.6.
            5.4.7.2.2. LL.M. Students. Send requests for attorneys in an LL.M. program to the
            Director, Professional Development Division, HQ USAF/JAX.
            5.4.7.2.3. Staff Judge Advocates. Send requests for staff judge advocates to the
            SJA’s commander.
            5.4.7.2.4. All Others. Send requests for all other attorneys to the requested counsel’s
            SJA, supervising officer, or commander.
     5.4.8. Appeals. The accused may request review of a disapproved IMDC request by the next
     higher level of supervision of the officer who denied the request. Appeals shall be forwarded
     to the convening authority through the trial counsel.
        5.4.8.1. If the convening authority originally denied the request, and declines to grant the
        request on appeal, forward the appeal to the convening authority’s superior officer for
        review and decision. The final decision is returned to the convening authority, who
        notifies the accused. There is no appeal from an IMDC request initially disapproved by a
        MAJCOM commander or higher authority.
        5.4.8.2. If an approval authority originally denied the request, the appeal is forwarded by
        the convening authority to that approval authority. If the approval authority declines to
        grant the request on appeal, he or she forwards the appeal to the approval authority’s
        superior officer for review and decision. The Deputy Judge Advocate General (DJAG)
        reviews denials by Directors of AFLOA/JAJ, AFLOA/JAC, AFLOA/JAS, AFJAGS or
        by HQ USAF directorate chiefs. There is no review of denials made by the DJAG. The
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            71


       final decision is returned to the convening authority, who notifies the accused of the
       decision.
       5.4.8.3. A military judge may, for good cause, determine that a particular IMDC is
       reasonably available, notwithstanding any provision of this instruction.
5.5. Oaths (Article 136, UCMJ; RCM 807).
   5.5.1. One-Time Oath. Military judges certified according to Article 26(b), UCMJ, military
   counsel, certified according to Article 27(b), UCMJ, and court reporters may take a one-time
   oath.
       5.5.1.1. Procedure for One-Time Oath. Any person authorized by Article 136, UCMJ,
       may administer the one-time oath. The person administering the oath completes a
       certificate indicating the place and date the oath was administered. The oath contains the
       typed name, signature, and qualifications of the person administering the oath. Give a
       copy to the person taking the oath.
          5.5.1.1.1. For military judges, send the original and one copy to HQ USAF/JAX.
          Use the following oath: “I (name of military judge), do (swear) (affirm) that I will
          faithfully and impartially perform the duties of military judge in any proceeding
          under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to which I am detailed to perform such
          duties, (so help me God).”
          5.5.1.1.2. For military counsel, send the original and one copy to HQ USAF/JAX.
          Use the following oath: “I [name of military counsel], do (swear) (affirm) that I will
          faithfully perform the duties of counsel in any proceeding under the Uniform Code of
          Military Justice to which I am detailed to perform such duties or in any court-martial
          in which I am to perform duties of individual defense counsel, (so help me God).”
          5.5.1.1.3. For court reporters, give the original to the reporter and file one copy in the
          office where the individual is assigned. If the individual transfers to another Air
          Force legal office, forward a copy of the oath to the receiving SJA. Use the following
          oath: “I (name of reporter), do (swear) (affirm) that I will faithfully perform the
          duties of (reporter) in any proceeding under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to
          which I am detailed, (so help me God).”
   5.5.2. Court Members. Swear in court members for each court-martial to which they are
   detailed. The trial counsel administers the oath.
   5.5.3. Interpreters. In a GCM or SPCM, the trial counsel or military judge administers an
   oath to the interpreter. In other proceedings, a person authorized by Article 136, UCMJ,
   administers the oath (e.g., summary court-martial officer, deposition officer, investigating
   officer). The oath must be included in the record of the proceeding. An interpreter is
   properly sworn after an affirmative response to the following oath: “Do you, [name of
   interpreter], (swear) (affirm) that you will faithfully perform the duties of interpreter in this
   proceeding, (so help you God)?”
5.6. Defense Investigative Support. Defense requests for investigative support will be made in
writing to the servicing SJA, who will forward the request along with a recommendation to the
convening authority. If the convening authority grants the request and investigative resources
 72                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


are available within the convening authority’s command that would satisfy the needs of the
defense, other than AFOSI investigators, the convening authority appoints an investigator.
      5.6.1. If the convening authority concludes that appointment of an AFOSI special agent is
      necessary under the circumstances, the convening authority will inform the local AFOSI
      detachment commander. The AFOSI detachment commander will forward the request
      through command channels for a determination of whether or not investigative resources
      exist to support the defense request. If HQ AFOSI/CC agrees that appointment of a special
      agent is appropriate and an agent is available, he or she will appoint one. The HQ
      AFOSI/CC is the decision authority for appointment of AFOSI agents as defense
      investigators, except in the extraordinary case where a trial judge specifically mandates the
      appointment of an AFOSI special agent. In all cases, the convening authority will provide
      the funding IAW 51-201, Figure 6.8, Note 6. See United States v. Pomarleau, 57 MJ 351
      (CMA 2002). Contact HQ AFOSI/JA with any questions regarding this policy or its
      application including provisions that apply to the conduct of AFOSI special agents who have
      been assigned to provide defense investigative support.

Section 5B—Court Reporters

5.7. General Information.
      5.7.1. Duties. The primary role of the Air Force court reporter is to report, transcribe, and
      assemble court-martial records, Article 32, UCMJ, investigations, and other proceedings, as
      required. The reporter is neutral and should not express personal opinions about the case
      being reported. Reporters are normally detailed to all Air Force GCMs and SPCMs. The
      reporter records everything that is said or done verbatim, from the initial Article 39(a)
      session until the court adjourns and maintains the reporter’s notes and recordings according
      to the Air Force Records Disposition Standards. As determined by the SJA, reporters assist
      counsel for both sides, hearing officers, and the military judge in preparing and marking
      documents associated with proceedings under the UCMJ. Upon the prior approval of the
      military judge, court reporters may authenticate records of trial (ROT) in SPCMs, including
      acquittals, not involving a bad conduct discharge (BCD). When authenticating the ROT, use
      the page provided for in the DD Form 490, Record of Trial, package, delete the words
      “military judge” and substitute the words “court reporter.”
      5.7.2. Detailing Court Reporters. The Air Force court reporter program is managed by the
      Director, USAF Judiciary. Requests for support, other than expeditionary court reporting
      requirements and mishap investigation boards, will be sent directly from the requesting office
      to the Director for assignment. Following assignment, SJAs detail court reporters to perform
      the functions specified in Article 28, UCMJ, and RCM 502(3)(b), and any other duties for
      which they are needed (RCM 501(c)). Requests for expeditionary court reporting
      requirements and mishap investigation boards will be sent to the Director from the Command
      requesting support.
      5.7.3. Methods of Reporting. Digital recording will be used as the primary method of
      recording. Court reporters must use both a primary and backup system to ensure a record can
      be accurately prepared.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         73


5.8. Enlisted Court Reporters. The primary role of the enlisted court reporter is to fulfill the
expeditionary court reporting requirement and support mishap investigation boards. They also
report and transcribe courts-martial, administrative discharge boards, Article 32 hearings,
depositions, and other proceedings as the expeditionary mission allows.

Section 5C—Detailing and Excusing Members (RCM 501, 502(a), 503(a) and 505);
Convening Orders (RCM 504)

5.9. Detailing Members. Convening authorities detail the best qualified persons for courts-
martial in accordance with the criteria in Article 25(d), UCMJ. Enough members should be
detailed so that, after challenges, a GCM will be comprised of at least five members and a SPCM
will be comprised of at least three members. Convening authorities may detail members under
their command or others made available by their commander. When detailing court members,
convening authorities may consider nominees submitted by subordinate commanders. For courts
involving Reservists, convening authorities should consider detailing Reserve members who
meet the qualifications in Article 25, UCMJ and RCM 502. The SJA must guard against
unlawful command influence or the appearance of such in the court member selection process,
which includes ensuring no involvement by trial counsel or assistant trial counsel. When
advising the convening authority on court member selection, the SJA reiterates the Article 25(d),
UCMJ, criteria. The SJA may prepare a list of proposed nominees. If such a list is used, the SJA
also informs the convening authority that he or she may consider persons on the nomination list
as well as any other eligible person subject to his or her command or others made available by
their commanders. The SJA maintains all documents submitted to the convening authority.
   5.9.1. Enlisted Members (RCM 503(a)(2)). If an enlisted accused requests that enlisted
   members serve as court members, the convening authority details enlisted members,
   following the guidance in this section. The convening authority should detail enough
   enlisted members so that, after challenges, the court will be comprised of at least one-third
   enlisted members. If officer members have already been detailed, the convening authority
   may replace officer members with enlisted members, or may detail enlisted members without
   excusing officer members. If the membership of the court falls below one-third enlisted
   members, the convening authority must detail additional enlisted members.
5.10. Changing or Excusing Detailed Members. Before the court-martial is assembled, the
convening authority may excuse members or change the members of a court-martial without
showing cause. The convening authority may delegate to the servicing SJA or other principal
assistant the authority to excuse individual members of a court-martial before a court is
assembled. No more than one-third of the members may be excused by anyone other than the
convening authority. RCM 505(c).
5.11. Special Orders Convening Courts-Martial.
   5.11.1. Generally. Prepare convening orders in accordance with RCM 504, 1302, and this
   chapter. Authenticate convening orders according to this instruction. Cite the current
   Department of the Air Force Special Order or other document authorizing the commander to
   convene courts (Figure 5.1). Convening orders can be amended. To reflect changes in court
   members, except when members are excused without replacement, amend the original order
   (Figure 5.2). If excusal of a member without replacement is not reduced to writing, the
   excusal must be announced on the record. Generally, issue no more than two amendments to
 74                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


      the original order. If it is necessary to further amend the convening order, do not issue a new
      amending order; instead, publish a new order convening a court-martial with a savings clause
      that transfers all cases in which the court has not yet been assembled to the new order (Figure
      5.3). Ensure all amendments to a convening order and all convening orders with a savings
      clause cite all prior orders. Give a copy of all convening orders and amendments to
      convening orders to the military judge and include in all copies of the ROT.
      5.11.2. Numbering Convening Orders. Orders convening courts-martial are special orders
      that are numbered consecutively on a fiscal year basis, starting with number 1. The number
      shall follow an A-series letter prefix. AFI 33-328, Administrative Orders, Table 2.1, Rule
      17. Use an A letter prefix for GCMs, an AB letter prefix for SPCMs, and an AC letter prefix
      for SCMs (see paragraph 5.2 for additional guidance on convening SCMs).
      5.11.3. Identification of Members. Special orders convening a court-martial should contain
      the name, rank, and unit of all persons detailed. Do not include personal information, i.e.
      social security number. If a detailed member is not under the command of the convening
      authority, ensure the special order clearly indicates that the member has been detailed with
      the concurrence of the member’s commander. See Figure 5.1.
      5.11.4. Members of Same Squadron. An enlisted court member may not be from the same
      unit as the accused. This limitation refers to the organization to which the individuals are
      assigned and does not apply to entities to which they are attached for administrative
      purposes. In no event does this limitation refer to an organization larger than a squadron or
      comparable organization.

           TRAVEL FUNDING, WITNESS PRODUCTION, AND IMMUNITY

Section 6A—Travel Funding

6.1. Funding Authorities. AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures,
(hereinafter “AFI 65-601v1”), Table 10.2, prescribes the travel funding authorities for persons
required for investigations and courts-martial. AFI 65-601v1 is controlling; however, the travel
funding table is reprinted at Figure 6.8. Additional procedural guidelines are distributed by
AFLOA/JAJM through the Central Witness Funding Guide to Witness Travel.
6.2. AFLOA Central Travel Funding. AFLOA/JAJM centrally funds and manages travel for
persons identified in AFI 65-601v1, Table 10.2, for travel required for Article 32 investigations
and courts-martial. Witnesses will be funded for Article 32 investigations and courts-martial
based on their status as determined by Figure 6.8 (See paragraph 6.2.2.1). AFLOA/JAJM does
not fund travel for other matters related to UCMJ proceedings, such as travel to and from
depositions and administrative actions. AFLOA/JAJM does not fund trial preparation days. If a
court-martial or Article 32 investigation is conducted within active duty channels for a Category
A or B Reservist, the applicable active duty convening authority prescribed in Figure 6.8 is
responsible for witness travel costs.
   6.2.1. Requesting AFLOA Central Travel Funds. RCM 703(c) governs the initial
   determination of whether to produce a witness. Once the determination is made to require
   the presence of a person whose travel may be funded by AFLOA/JAJM, including a witness
   required by the military judge, the SJA requests travel funds electronically through the
   Witness Funding Management System (WFMS). WFMS tracks all requests submitted by
   legal offices and is currently the sole method for requesting central witness funding. This
   system provides an up-to-date status on each request. In addition, the system has bulletin and
   e-mail capability that allows AFLOA/JAJM’s Central Witness Funding (CWF) branch to
   provide essential information to field legal offices.
       6.2.1.1. All requests should be sent electronically through WFMS to AFLOA/JAJM at
       least 10 calendar days before the requested person is required to travel. Requests not
       received in a timely manner may require the convening authority to provide the initial
       funding.              Use         the      WFMS        link    on        FLITE      at
       https://aflsa.jag.af.mil/flite/training/jaguar/wfms/wfms_home.php.
   6.2.2. The requester will need a FLITE ID and password, or a CAC card and PIN to log into
   the database. All personnel assigned to the requesting legal office can create a request in
   WFMS. Creating a request includes supplying the initial information in WFMS and
   forwarding the request to a local WFMS manager for approval. The SJA, the Chief of
   Military Justice and the NCOIC of Military Justice are appointed as local WFMS managers.
   WFMS managers have the ability to reset permissions and ensure the correct WFMS
   managers are posted at all times. Only WFMS managers can approve, cancel, and forward
   the initial request to AFLOA/JAJM. AFLOA/JAJM will not know a request has been
   generated until the local WFMS manager approves and forwards the request to
   AFLOA/JAJM. WFMS will not allow a WFMS manager to approve and forward an initial
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          79


  funding request he or she created. WFMS managers are responsible for managing the status
  of witnesses until the witness voucher has been paid, expert fees are paid, if applicable, and
  all orders and vouchers have been provided to AFLOA/JAJM. WFMS managers will ensure
  all fields on the CWF request, constructive travel worksheet, and if required, the memoranda
  of understanding (See Figure 6.1) are completed prior to forwarding the request to
  AFLOA/JAJM. After approval by the local WFMS manager, the request will be forwarded to
  CWF for review.
     6.2.2.1. All requests received through WFMS are assumed to be approved by the
     appropriate authority for witness production. AFLOA/JAJM does not determine whether
     a witness will or will not be produced for the proceeding. Witness production and
     witness funding are two separate processes, and AFLOA/JAJM only determines whether
     or not the witness will be centrally funded. A witness that is not funded by
     AFLOA/JAJM may still need to be funded by the Convening Authority. Therefore,
     funding may be approved or denied without regard to whether the witness is required to
     be produced. The requesting office will be notified through WFMS regarding central
     funding approval or denial.
     6.2.2.2. Per Diem Rates for Centrally Funded Witnesses will be determined based on the
     Joint Federal Travel Regulations, Volume 1. If lodging is not available and either a non-
     availability number or a non-availability letter is provided, or there is a letter from the
     requesting legal office stating a dining facility is not operable, then full rate per diem is
     authorized.
         6.2.2.2.1. Military witnesses will be briefed that each day where adequate
         government quarters are available on the installation to which the member is assigned
         TDY, the dining facility/mess is available for all three meals on the installation, and
         the member is not traveling, then the government meal rate (GMR) is directed (JFTR,
         Vol 1, para U4151).
         6.2.2.2.2. Military witnesses will be briefed that each day where adequate
         government quarters are available on the installation to which the member is assigned
         TDY, the dining facility/mess is available for one meal on the installation, and the
         member is not traveling, then the proportional meal rate (PMR) is directed (JFTR,
         Vol 1, para U4151).
     6.2.2.3. The requesting legal office is responsible for ensuring all TDY arrangements are
     completed in a timely manner (flight reservations, billeting, transportation, et cetera.)
     AFLOA/JAJM is responsible for funding the witness to travel from their current location
     (PDS, leave, or AOR) to the base where the proceeding is being conducted. It is the base
     legal office’s responsibility to ensure the witness is transported to and from court, meals,
     and the lodging facility or hotel.
         6.2.2.3.1. AFLOA/JAJM considers funding rental vehicles in accordance with the
         Joint Federal Travel Regulation, paragraph U3415 Special Conveyance Use. It states,
         “An order-issuing official may authorize/approve a special conveyance when
         advantageous to the Government.           Travelers’ personal preference or minor
         inconvenience shall not be the basis for authorizing/approving special conveyance
         use.” If disapproved by AFLOA/JAJM, the convening authority may choose to
         personally fund a rental vehicle from a separate fund cite.
80                                                                         AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


        6.2.2.4. The finance office associated with AFLOA/JAJM will not process a manual DD
        Form 1610 or DD Form 1351-1. The requesting legal office is responsible for obtaining
        Defense Travel System (DTS) access for the witness.
     6.2.3. Fund Cite Authorizations and Travel Itinerary. AFLOA/JAJM furnishes procedural
     instructions through e-mail for AFLOA/JAJM funded travel.
        6.2.3.1. AFLOA/JAJM does not fund trial preparation and will only fund a witness to
        arrive the night prior to the start of the proceeding. A witness may begin traveling one
        day prior to the start of the proceeding for stateside travel, or two days prior to the start of
        the proceeding for travel to or from an overseas location. The convening authority may
        choose to personally fund trial preparation days from a separate fund cite. Justification is
        required for witnesses requiring more than five temporary duty days for stateside travel,
        and seven temporary duty days for overseas travel.
        6.2.3.2. Obtain prior approval from AFLOA/JAJM for any deviations to the travel
        itinerary, or the organization approving such deviation may be responsible for the
        additional costs. Witnesses subject to recall should remain in the local area until released
        to avoid travel itinerary deviations.
        6.2.3.3. The requesting legal office’s WFMS manager must notify AFLOA/JAJM
        immediately when the presence of a centrally funded witness is no longer required.
     6.2.4. Expert Witnesses. AFLOA/JAJM only funds expert witnesses involved in urinalysis
     cases (See Figure 6.8). In cases involving an expert urinalysis witness, the SJA for the
     requesting legal office must also certify the attendance and testimony of the expert witness in
     writing before payment of expert or inconvenience fees can be made.
        6.2.4.1. Experts in Urinalysis Cases. AFLOA/JAJM centrally funds experts (forensic
        experts, e.g., chemists, toxicologists, qualified physicians) approved by a convening
        authority to testify at courts-martial relating to urinalysis testing. Follow the instructions
        above and include the witness fee per day, travel costs, and per diem. The request must
        include a statement of the convening authority’s approval of the expert and the amount of
        compensation. Before requesting funding for a non-government civilian expert witness,
        trial counsel must first ascertain the non-availability of the forensic urinalysis experts at
        the Air Force Drug Testing Laboratory, Lackland AFB, Texas, or any other expert under
        contract with the Air Force. SJAs should obtain written agreements with non-
        government civilian expert witnesses fixing their rate of compensation and
        reimbursement for expenses. A sample agreement is provided at Figure 6.2. For
        additional requirements, see paragraph 6.4.5.
        6.2.4.2. Fee Limits. AFLOA/JAJM funding for urinalysis expert witness fees is limited
        to $1,000 per day, with a maximum of $4,000 per witness, per case for in-court testimony
        only. Expert witness fees paid by AFLOA/JAJM will not include payment for days
        devoted to travel, trial preparation, or consultation. Any agreement to pay amounts
        exceeding AFLOA/JAJM’s limits is not binding on AFLOA/JAJM and will result in the
        convening authority paying the difference. The SJA must certify the attendance and
        testimony of expert witnesses before payment of expert fees can be made.
        6.2.4.3. Inconvenience Fees. AFLOA/JAJM may fund up to $500 per expert witness,
        per case, for inconvenience or cancellation fees for prior approved urinalysis experts.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             81


       Inconvenience fees not approved in advance by AFLOA/JAJM will not be paid from
       central witness funds. Payment will not be considered appropriate unless a written
       agreement provided for inconvenience or cancellation fees at the time the witness’
       services were contracted. In every case, there must be a showing of actual inconvenience
       and financial loss to the witness, and cancellation within five days of the authorized
       travel date. In order to demonstrate actual inconvenience and financial loss, more than a
       mere cancellation is required. Expert witnesses are expected to mitigate any financial
       loss caused by a cancellation.
   6.2.5. Consultants. Central witness funds are to be used for expert witnesses, not
   consultants. The convening authority is responsible for payment of consultant services and
   fees. The funding request constitutes a representation the witness is expected to testify at the
   trial. However, should AFLOA/JAJM approve and fund an expert witness who does not
   testify at trial, the funding authorization for the travel expenses will not be revoked.

Section 6B—Witness Production

6.3. Military Witnesses. Provide notice to the witness and their commander of the time, place,
and date the witness’s presence is required, and request the commander issue any necessary
orders to the witness. RCM 703(e)(1).
6.4. Civilian Witnesses. A civilian may be compelled to appear as a witness before a court-
martial, military commission, court of inquiry, or any other military court or board, or before any
military or civil officer designated to take a deposition to be read in evidence before such a court,
commission, or board if they have been duly issued a subpoena in accordance with Article 47,
UCMJ and RCM 703. Except as provided in paragraphs 6.4.4, 6.4.5, and 6.4.6, use DD Form
453, Subpoena, and DD Form 453-1, Travel Order, to obtain the presence of civilian witnesses
and to authorize reimbursement for their travel expenses. Mark through any inapplicable and/or
outdated dollar amounts in parentheses on DD Form 453-1 and insert the applicable dollar
amounts in the space provided. DTS may be used to generate and process the DD Form 453-1
and DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher. RCM 703(e)(2) Discussion.
   6.4.1. Informal Service for Willing Witnesses. When a civilian witness will appear
   voluntarily and a subpoena is issued, informal service of process by mail, including
   arrangements for travel and advance travel pay, is authorized. Figure 6.3. is a sample letter
   to accomplish informal service. RCM 703(e)(2)(D), Discussion.
   6.4.2. Formal Service for Unwilling Witnesses. If a witness is unwilling to attend the court-
   martial voluntarily, serve the subpoena personally on the witness and tender travel orders and
   prescribed fees. RCM 703(e)(2)(D) and Discussion. Appropriate fees and mileage must be
   paid or tendered, (until such time RCM 703 is amended to reflect the changes made to
   Article 47, UCMJ by the FY 2012 National Defense Authorization Act, effective 31
   December 2011), when serving the subpoena to meet the threshold requirement for
   requesting a Warrant of Attachment and subject the witness to federal prosecution under
   Article 47, UCMJ. Consult with the base Accounting & Finance Office (AFO) to determine
   the proper method of obtaining the necessary funds. The SJA or trial counsel may be
   designated as an accounting and finance certifying payment official in order to receive the
   witness travel funds for a personal service on the witness. In the alternative, the AFO may
   draft a check to the witness that accompanies the subpoena for service or attempted service
82                                                                        AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


     upon the witness. Serve the subpoena in person, either by the trial counsel or a designee
     when the witness is in the local area, or contact the SJA or commander of the military
     installation nearest the witness for assistance. Personal service may also be requested
     through the local law enforcement office or AFOSI detachment nearest the witness.
     6.4.3. Failure to Appear. If the witness fails or refuses to appear, exhaust every reasonable
     means to secure live testimony. If necessary, use a DD Form 454, Warrant of Attachment, to
     compel the witness to appear or produce evidence. See RCM 703(e)(2)(G), Discussion;
     United States. v. Ortiz, 35 M.J. 391 (CMA 1992). The witness may be prosecuted for failure
     to comply.
        6.4.3.1. Requirements for a Warrant of Attachment. A Warrant of Attachment may be
        issued only if in compliance with the provisions set out in RCM 703(e)(2)(G)(ii).
        6.4.3.2. Processing a Warrant of Attachment.
            6.4.3.2.1. In most cases, a Warrant of Attachment should be executed by the U.S.
            Marshals Service. Otherwise, anyone 18 years or older may execute a Warrant of
            Attachment.    Military law enforcement may execute a Warrant of Attachment.
            However, military law enforcement should only be considered a last resort.
            6.4.3.2.2. Provide the U.S. Marshals Service with the following:
                6.4.3.2.2.1. A copy of the Warrant of Attachment;
                6.4.3.2.2.2. A copy of the subpoena;
                6.4.3.2.2.3. A copy of the certificate of service or receipt;
                6.4.3.2.2.4. An affidavit indicating that appropriate fees and mileage were
                tendered to the witness where applicable, or that the witness was provided a
                means for reimbursement for fees and mileage;
                6.4.3.2.2.5. The dollar amount, and reasons that witness is material and why it is
                believed the witness refuses or willfully neglects to appear;
                6.4.3.2.2.6. A Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) number.
                (See paragraph 6.4.3.4.).
            6.4.3.2.3. The U.S. Marshals Service General Counsel’s Office will review the
            Warrant of Attachment and determine the appropriate executing office. As this
            process can take some time, trial counsel or the Government representative should
            consider requesting relief pursuant to RCM 707(c) if applicable.
            6.4.3.2.4. If the U.S. Marshals Service is executing the Warrant of Attachment, it will
            make travel, lodging, and housing arrangements for the escorts and witness as
            appropriate. Otherwise, the Government is responsible for making travel, lodging
            and housing arrangements for the escorts and witness.
            6.4.3.2.5. Only such non-deadly force as is necessary to bring the witness to the
            proceeding is authorized.
        6.4.3.3. Escorting and Detaining a Civilian Witness. Once a Warrant of Attachment is
        executed, the civilian witness must be under escort or otherwise accounted for at all
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           83


     times. Escort and housing of a civilian witness ceases once a determination is made by
     the authority issuing the warrant that the witness is no longer needed for the proceeding.
         6.4.3.3.1. If the U.S. Marshals Service or other civilian law enforcement agency did
         not execute the Warrant of Attachment, a civilian witness must be accompanied by a
         minimum of two escorts at all times. Armed escorts should be used as a last resort
         and only if absolutely necessary.
         6.4.3.3.2. If it is necessary to house a civilian witness prior to the proceeding and the
         U.S. Marshals Service or other civilian law enforcement agency did not execute the
         Warrant of Attachment, coordinate with the U.S. Marshals Service to arrange for
         housing of the witness in the nearest available civilian detention facility. Every effort
         should be made to minimize the amount of time a civilian witness is housed in a
         civilian detention facility. Never house a civilian witness in a military confinement
         facility.
     6.4.3.4. Funding. The funding authority responsible for funding the travel of the witness
     pursuant to Figure 6.8 is also responsible for funding the travel of personnel necessary to
     effect the execution of the Warrant of Attachment and escort the witness to the location
     specified in the subpoena. If detention of the witness is required, either at the location the
     Warrant of Attachment is executed or at the location specified in the subpoena, the
     funding authority responsible for funding the travel of the witness is also responsible for
     fees charged by the facility detaining the witness. If the entity executing the Warrant of
     Attachment is another Federal agency, such as the U.S. Marshals Service, funding will be
     accomplished through a MIPR.
  6.4.4. Subpoena Limitations. A civilian witness may not be subpoenaed to testify at a court-
  martial outside the United States or at an Article 32, UCMJ, hearing. However, a subpoena
  duces tecum (for documents) may be duly issued in accordance with Article 47, UCMJ and
  RCM 703, when RCM 703 is changed to reflect the amendments to Article 47, UCMJ, for an
  investigation pursuant to Article 32 (b), UCMJ. Issue Invitational Travel Orders (Figure 6.4)
  to a civilian witness who voluntarily agrees to appear at such proceedings. Joint Federal
  Travel Regulations (JFTR), Vol. 2, Appendix E. A sample letter to accompany the
  Invitational Travel Order is at Figure 6.3.
  6.4.5. Civilian Expert Witnesses for Urinalysis Cases (not employees of the United States).
  When a party determines government employment of a civilian expert witness is necessary,
  the party shall submit a written request to the convening authority, with notice to the
  opposing party, to authorize the employment and fix the expert’s compensation. RCM
  703(d). The terms of employment in approved requests should be memorialized in a
  Memorandum of Agreement for Expert Witnesses. See sample at Figure 6.2 Use Invitational
  Travel Orders (Figure 6.4) to authorize travel of civilian experts and to notify them of
  billeting and travel arrangements. The finance office associated with AFLOA/JAJM will not
  process a manual DD Form 1610 or DD Form 1351-1. The requesting legal office is
  responsible for obtaining DTS access for the witness.
  6.4.6. Civilians Employed by the United States. Civilian employees of the United States can
  be required to testify incident to their employment with appropriate travel orders issued for
  this purpose. A subpoena is not required. For DoD civilian employees requested as
  witnesses, the appropriate travel order is the DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for
84                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


     TDY Travel of DoD Personnel. For non-DoD federal civilian employees providing
     testimony incident to their employment, the employee’s agency will prepare the appropriate
     travel order. Do not use Invitational Travel Orders for federal civilian employees,
     contractors or Non-Appropriated Fund employees.
     6.4.7. Subpoenas to the Media. Air Force policy requires the exercise of due care when
     issuing subpoenas to media organizations to avoid unnecessary imposition on the news
     gathering process and thereby protecting the media’s First Amendment role.
        6.4.7.1. Prior to issuing a subpoena to a member of the news media, trial counsel will
        consult with the SPCMCA SJA. The SPCMCA SJA will forward a request to the
        GCMCA SJA addressing the following points:
            6.4.7.1.1. That all reasonable attempts were made to obtain the information sought
            from alternative sources;
            6.4.7.1.2. That all reasonable alternative investigative steps were taken to obtain the
            information sought;
            6.4.7.1.3. The results of negotiations with the media. Negotiations should make clear
            the government’s needs in the particular case and its willingness to respond to
            particular concerns of the media;
            6.4.7.1.4. That reasonable grounds exist to conclude, based on information obtained
            from other sources, that a crime has occurred and that the information sought is
            essential to the case; and,
            6.4.7.1.5. That to the extent possible, the subpoena is directed at material information
            regarding a limited subject matter, will cover a reasonably limited period of time, and
            will avoid requiring production of a large volume of unpublished material.
        6.4.7.2. The GCMCA SJA will approve or disapprove the issuance of the subpoena. The
        SPCMCA SJA will immediately file a Special Interest Report (SIR) IAW paragraph 13.8
        of this instruction.
        6.4.7.3. In the event exigent circumstances prevent prior consultation with the GCMCA
        SJA, a trial counsel may only issue a subpoena with the SPCMCA SJA’s approval. In
        that case, the SJA will immediately inform the GCMCA SJA, MAJCOM SJA, and
        AFLOA/JAJM by e-mail of the issuance of the subpoena and the exigent circumstances
        that precluded prior consultation.
        6.4.7.4. The principles set forth in this guidance are not intended to create or recognize
        any legally enforceable right in any person.
  6.4.8. Rates for Civilian Witnesses.
        6.4.8.1. Civilians Employed by the United States. When summoned as a witness, a
        civilian in the employ of the government shall be paid as authorized by the JTR, Vol. 2
        (for DoD civilian employees) or by the Federal Travel Regulation, 41 C.F.R. Subtitle F
        (for non-DoD civilian employees).
        6.4.8.2. Civilians Not Employed by the United States. Pay fees and allowances
        authorized under 28 U.S.C. § 1821 (per diem, mileage, subsistence). JTR, Vol. 2,
        paragraph C4562 and Appendix E.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                              85


   6.4.9. Processing Travel Vouchers. The requesting legal office shall ensure travelers
   promptly prepare and submit travel vouchers to AFLOA/JAJM as applicable. If
   AFLOA/JAJM does not have access to the member’s DTS account, all paid vouchers should
   be e-mailed to CWF within 5 days of completion. All DTS users will accomplish their
   vouchers through DTS and it is the base’s responsibility to ensure AFLOA/JAJM promptly
   receives a copy of the paid DTS voucher. If a witness does not file a voucher within 30
   days of the initial travel date, the orders will automatically be revoked.
      6.4.9.1. If a military witness files a voucher 30 days after the initial travel date, the travel
      voucher will be returned as “no order on file” and a letter from his/her commander will
      be required to explain why the voucher was not filed in a timely manner.
      6.4.9.2. If a civilian witness files a voucher 30 days after the initial travel date, the travel
      voucher will be returned as “no order on file” and a letter may be required to explain why
      the voucher was not filed in a timely manner.
      6.4.9.3. If an accused is adjudged confinement, ensure the travel voucher is filed prior to
      entering confinement. Failure to file the travel voucher prior to entering confinement will
      require the member’s unit to make arrangements for the confined member to file the
      voucher.
   6.4.10. Processing Expert Fee Vouchers. Use the SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases
   and Services Other than Personal or SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on
   Official Business. The SJA with administrative responsibility for the proceeding in which the
   expert witness testified ensures the expert witness prepares and submits the appropriate forms
   to the finance office servicing the base where the court convened; however, Centrally Funded
   Witnesses’ forms are sent to AFLOA/JAJM for processing. Before AFLOA/JAJM pays for a
   civilian expert witness, the SJA must certify the dates of attendance and any scheduled
   witness fees (expert testimony, inconvenience, etc.). (See paragraph 6.2.4 and Figure 6.7).
6.5. Special Witness Production Issues.
   6.5.1. Foreign Area Clearance and Passport Applications. Allow appropriate time for the
   processing of foreign area clearances when witnesses must travel to courts-martial convened
   outside the United States. (DoD Directive 4500.54E, DoD Foreign Clearance Program
   (FCP)). Ensure the prospective witness has a passport or applies for one. The responsible
   SJA may request that the base nearest the requested witness process the passport application
   or the witness can personally process the passport application. The State Department will
   normally process a passport application without the normal fee if the orders expressly
   provide for it. Contact the nearest Passport Office for further guidance.
   6.5.2. AFOSI. Submit requests for AFOSI agents to the AFOSI detachment to which the
   agent is assigned. Submit requests for threatened Airmen and confidential sources to the
   local AFOSI detachment. A threatened airman is a person who has had “threats of bodily
   harm or death” made against the airman and the threats must be “of such severity that
   military and civilian authorities are unable to provide the family’s continued safety.” See
   Attachment 12, AFI 36-2110. Only AFOSI may contact another installation to request
   threatened Airmen and confidential sources.
   6.5.3. Deployed Witness. Normally, requests to return a deployed witness will be routed
   through the Combatant Command’s Service Component’s legal office. For example, for
 86                                                                        AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


      USAF witnesses, AFCENT/JA will coordinate request with USCENTCOM, 17 AF/JA will
      coordinate requests with USAFRICOM, et cetera. Additionally, contact AFLOA/JAJM in
      cases requiring the use of central witness funding.

Section 6C—Immunity

6.6. Grants of Immunity (RCM 704 & MRE 301(c)). Only a GCMCA possesses the authority
to grant immunity to witnesses. All grants of immunity must be in writing and attached to the
ROT as an allied paper. Figure 6.6 is a sample grant of immunity and order to testify. Grants of
immunity should include language stating the immunity grant takes effect on the date the witness
receives a copy of it. When another GCMCA retains ADCON over the witness to be
immunized, prior coordination with that retaining GCMCA is recommended.
      6.6.1. Witnesses Not Subject to UCMJ. The GCMCA may disapprove immunity requests
      for witnesses not subject to the UCMJ without DoJ coordination. However, the GCMCA
      may approve such requests only after receiving authorization from the Attorney General of
      the United States or other authority designated under 18 U.S.C. § 6004. Prepare requests for
      DoJ authorization in accordance with paragraph 6.6.4.
      6.6.2. Witnesses Who May Be Considered for Federal Prosecution. If DoJ has an interest in
      investigating and prosecuting a witness suspected of criminal activity pursuant to DoD
      Directive 5525.7, Implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding Between the
      Department of Justice and the Department of Defense Relating to the Investigation and
      Prosecution of Certain Crimes (found in the Manual for Courts Martial, Appendix 3),
      prepare the immunity request according to paragraph 6.6.4, regardless of whether the witness
      is subject to the UCMJ.
      6.6.3. National Security Cases. Process immunity requests for witnesses suspected of
      criminal activity involving national security, as specified in paragraph 13.8.2.3, according to
      paragraph 6.6.4, regardless of whether the witness is subject to the UCMJ. AFLOA/JAJM is
      responsible for coordinating such cases with the DoJ and other interested United States
      agencies. NOTE: Complete the additional reporting and processing requirements specified in
      paragraph 13.8 for national security cases independent of immunity authorization requests.
      6.6.4. Requests for DoJ Authorization. In cases requiring DoJ authorization, the SJA
      administering the court-martial initiates the request for DoJ authorization. When the
      GCMCA indicates in a memorandum the intent to grant immunity, the GCMCA SJA
      forwards the request with written endorsement, preferably by e-mail, directly to
      AFLOA/JAJM, with information copies to the MAJCOM SJA. Forward requests 30 days in
      advance of the date the witness is expected to testify. Consider requesting a delay pursuant
      to RCM 707(c)(1) while authorization is pending. Include the following information in the
      request:
         6.6.4.1. Case name and nature of the proceeding for which requesting immunity;
         6.6.4.2. Nature of the charges against the accused and anticipated date of the proceeding;
         6.6.4.3. Name, social security number, date and place of birth, and address of the
         witness;
         6.6.4.4. The witness’ military status and organization, if any;
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            87


       6.6.4.5. Whether the defense or prosecution requested the immunity;
       6.6.4.6. Name, grade, organization, and mailing address of the GCMCA who will grant
       the immunity after receiving DoJ authorization and a statement that the GCMCA
       supports the immunity request. (Note: Immunity is not actually granted until approved
       by the GCMCA after receiving DoJ authorization.);
       6.6.4.7. An explanation of why immunity is necessary, including whether any state or
       Federal charges are pending against the witness and a description of those charges, if any;
       6.6.4.8. Whether the witness is currently incarcerated and, if so, the location, cause, and
       length of incarceration;
       6.6.4.9. A summary of the witness’ expected testimony;
       6.6.4.10. Factual basis for believing the witness will assert the privilege against self-
       incrimination, including the nature of the offenses in which the witness may be
       incriminated;
       6.6.4.11. The likelihood of the witness testifying, should immunity be granted;
       6.6.4.12. Name, title, address and telephone number of the representative from the local
       State’s Attorney’s Office and United States Attorney’s Office with whom trial counsel
       coordinated the request. Include information on whether the representative supports or
       opposes the request.
   6.6.5. Preliminary Discussions of Immunity. Judge advocates and investigators must be
   exceedingly careful in discussing the possibility of immunity with anyone involved in an
   investigation or potential prosecution. Avoid creating a perceived expectation of immunity
   that may be unfounded. The best practice is to first coordinate potential grants of immunity
   with the convening authority, and when appropriate, DoJ.

         You are invited to proceed from ([home address] [work address]) on [date travel begins]
to arrive at [place required] by [time required] for the purpose of [purpose of travel, e.g.,
testifying in the Article 32 investigation of A1C John Doe] for approximately ___ days. Upon

(NOTE: PLEASE GUARD TRANPORTATION TICKETS CAREFULLY. If a transportation

AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            93


___You may arrange transportation. The following rules apply:

        You must arrange your transportation with a travel office under contract with the U.S.
Government when the travel office is authorized by contract to arrange transportation for
travelers who are not Government employees. If you are in a foreign country, except for Canada
and Mexico, you may use a travel office not under contract to the Government if ticketing cannot
be secured from a branch office or general agent of an American-flag carrier. If you purchase
transportation from a travel office not under contract to the Government, reimbursement is
limited to the cost to the Government on a constructive basis for transportation that would have
been arranged by a travel office under contract with the Government if available. If the contract
between the Government and the travel office does not permit the travel office to arrange
transportation for contractor/contractor employees or others who are not Government employees,
reimbursement for transportation may not exceed coach class air accommodations unless
otherwise permitted in the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), paragraph C2204-A.

       DoD policy in using regularly scheduled air transportation is:

(a) accommodations selected shall be the least costly service that permits satisfactory
accomplishment of the mission of the traveler, and

(b) United States carriers must be used for all commercial foreign air transportation if service
provided by those carriers is available; otherwise, reimbursement for the cost of transportation is
not allowed.

___You are authorized to travel by Privately Owned Conveyance as advantageous to the
Government. Reimbursement shall be at the rate of $0.___ per mile, plus the cost of necessary
parking fees and bridge, ferry and tolls incurred, including per diem, while in travel status under
this travel order.

___You are authorized to travel by Privately Owned Conveyance on a constructive basis. You
would normally be authorized to travel by common carrier. Reimbursement shall be limited to
the cost of travel by the usual mode of common carrier, including per diem.

       Receipts: Ticket stubs are required to substantiate your transportation cost. Receipts are
required for lodging. Receipts are required for all items of expense in an amount of $75 or more,
plus any applicable tax.

___You are paid a per diem allowance to cover your expenses for lodging and meals and
incidental expenses (M&IE). Room taxes at locations in the 50 states, District of Columbia,
territories and possessions and the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and Northern Mariana Islands
 94                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


are reimbursed separately. Room taxes in foreign areas are included in the total lodging cost and
are not reimbursed separately. While traveling in connection with the Invitational Travel Order,
you are authorized a per diem equal to the daily amount you pay for lodging, plus a fixed amount
for meals and incidental expenses (M&IE). That amount is limited to the applicable maximum
amount prescribed on the Per Diem Committee homepage:
http://www.defensetravel.dod.mil/site/perdiem.cfm for the locality concerned. Even if your
costs, particularly for lodging, are more than the applicable maximum per diem rate prescribed,
only the maximum per diem rate is payable. (See the Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR),
Chapter 4, Part L, for applicable rules.)

for meals and incidental expenses (M&IE). You are required to itemize your lodging expenses

incidental expenses (M&IE). You must itemize all you subsistence expenses. Subsistence
expenses include lodging; meals; fees and tips to waiters, bellboys, maids and porters; personal
laundry, pressing and dry cleaning (see NOTE below); local transportation (including usual tips)
between places of lodging, duty and where meals are taken; and other necessary expenses. You

travel is within CONUS and requires at least 4 consecutive nights lodging while on Government
travel. There is no separate reimbursement for laundry/dry cleaning and pressing of clothing

NOTES:
1. The JFTR, Volume 1, Chapter 7, Part O, covers travel of members for disciplinary action.
The TDY orders for members traveling as an Accused must include a statement “member not
entitled to per diem expenses in connection with disciplinary action.”

2. Funding by USAF Judiciary circuit to which assigned ONLY for USAF Judiciary Members.
The Convening Authority funds costs for other individuals.

3. The USAF Judiciary Circuit to which assigned when the attorney-client relationship was
formed.

4. AFLOA/JAJM will fund if the IMDC is not assigned to the USAF Judiciary at the time the
IMDC request is made and had no prior attorney-client relationship with the requestor on the
matter in issue.

5. The JFTR, Volume 1, Paragraph U7060 directs that travel expenses of members summoned as
witnesses shall be paid from funds of the requesting Service.

6. Submit requests through local AFOSI detachments. Fund according to the status of the person
requested (e.g., AF Active Duty, Reservist, ANG, civilian, etc. as noted in the table).

7. AFOSI agents assigned as defense investigators to an accused and defense counsel are funded
by the Convening Authority.

8. For expert witnesses in urinalysis cases, request AFLOA/JAJM funding in accordance with
this publication. All fees in excess of AFLOA/JAJM established fee limits shall be paid by the

AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            101


9. Funding for testimony of Federal civilian employees belonging to non-DoD Agencies is a
Convening Authority responsibility. However, if a non-DoD Federal civilian employee is being
called to present testimony in a case that involves an activity in connection with which he or she
is employed, funding from the employing agency may be possible. See 5 U.S.C. 5751 and 28
CFR, Part 21, Section 21.2(d). The Comptroller General has defined the extent to which the case
must be related to the agency‘s activity as a condition to the agency‘s responsibility for payment
in 23 Comp. Gen. 47, 49 (1943) which states, “the employing agency is required to pay….the
traveling expenses incurred by the employee witness only where the information or facts
ascertained by the employee as part of his official duties forms the basis of the case, or where the
proceeding is predicated upon law that that agency is required to administer.” Funding from
other agencies under 5 U.S.C. 5751 should only be sought in situations where the other agency‘s
funding responsibility can be clearly established under the law. Furthermore, if the employing
agency is not forthcoming with the funds, ultimate responsibility for funding to ensure the
presence of necessary witnesses remains with the Convening Authority.

10. AFLOA/JAJM will fund ANG members who are in Title 10 status at the time travel is
required if it involves intercommand travel between the Title 10 duty station and the location of
the UCMJ proceeding.

11. The JFTR, Volume 1, Paragraph U7451 and AFI 31-205 cover funding of prisoners and
prisoner escorts. The prisoner‘s travel will be funded according to the status of the prisoner (e.g.,
AF Active Duty, Reservist, ANG, civilian, etc. as noted in the table). The Convening Authority
requesting the prisoner‘s appearance will provide escort funding.

                                            Chapter 7

                           VICTIM AND WITNESS ASSISTANCE

Section 7A—Purpose and Objectives

7.1. Purpose. This chapter describes the Air Force Victim and Witness Assistance Program
(VWAP), implements the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. §§ 10601-
10605), the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (18 U.S.C. § 3771), DoD Directive 1030.01, Victim and
Witness Assistance, and DoD Instruction 1030.2, Victim and Witness Assistance Procedures.
This chapter establishes responsibility for the VWAP at the Headquarters Air Force and
subordinate levels. It provides guidance for the treatment of victims and witnesses of offenses
under the UCMJ, and victims and witnesses of offenses under the jurisdiction of local, state,
other federal, or foreign authorities during those stages of the criminal justice process conducted
primarily by the Air Force. This chapter provides guidance for the protection and assistance of
victims and witnesses, enhances their roles in the military criminal justice process, and preserves
the constitutional rights of an accused. Figure 7.1 provides a list of VWAP responsibilities with
the corresponding responsible base agencies. These provisions create no cause of action or
defense in favor of any person arising out of a failure to comply with the VWAP. The VWAP
places no limitations on the lawful prerogatives of Air Force personnel.
   7.1.1. VWAP Council. Each installation Local Responsible Official (LRO) shall establish a
   VWAP Council, if the agencies below are present on the installation, to ensure victim and
   witness service providers follow an interdisciplinary approach. The following agencies or
   functions, when present on the installation, will designate a VWAP Council representative:
   Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC), Family Advocacy Program, Security Forces,
   AFOSI, Surgeon General, the Airman and Family Readiness Center, installation chaplaincy,
   and Staff Judge Advocate. In addition, the LRO will appoint a squadron commander and a
   first sergeant to the VWAP Council and may appoint other representatives as appropriate.
   The LRO will chair the VWAP Council, which will meet, at a minimum, annually.
   7.1.2. Application of the VWAP. The VWAP applies in all cases in which criminal conduct
   adversely affects victims or in which witnesses provide information regarding criminal
   activity if any portion of the investigation is conducted primarily by the DoD Components.
   Pay special attention to victims of serious, violent crime, but ensure all victims and witnesses
   of crime who suffer physical, financial, or emotional trauma receive the assistance and
   protection to which they are entitled. A victim or victims of an offense shall be identified at
   the earliest opportunity after the detection of a crime at which it may be done without
   interfering with an investigation. While various Air Force agencies have particular
   responsibility for the VWAP, the provision of victim and witness assistance is to be a
   coordinated effort among all agencies providing services to individuals.
7.2. Objectives. Within available resources and in accordance with applicable law, the
following are objectives of the Air Force VWAP:
   7.2.1. Mitigate the physical, psychological, and financial hardships suffered by victims and
   witnesses of offenses investigated by US Air Force authorities;
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             103


   7.2.2. Foster cooperation of victims and witnesses within the military criminal justice
   system; and
   7.2.3. Ensure best efforts are made to accord to victims of crime certain enumerated rights.

Section 7B—Definitions

7.3. Victim. A person who suffered direct physical, emotional, or financial harm as the result of
an offense. An offense need not be proven in court for there to be a “victim” for purposes of
VWAP. A person may be identified as a “victim” at the earliest opportunity after the detection
of a crime. Victims include, but are not limited to:
   7.3.1. All military members and their family members, and DoD civilian employees and
   their family members when stationed outside the continental United States;
   7.3.2. When a victim is incompetent, incapacitated, deceased, or under 18 years of age, one
   of the following may represent the victim (in order of priority):
       7.3.2.1. Spouse;
       7.3.2.2. Legal guardian;
       7.3.2.3. Parent;
       7.3.2.4. Child;
       7.3.2.5. Sibling;
       7.3.2.6. Another family member; or
       7.3.2.7. Another person designated by a court.
   7.3.3. In the case of a victim that is an institutional entity, an authorized representative of the
   institutional entity.
7.4. Witness. A person who has information or evidence of a crime and provides that
information or evidence to an Air Force official. When the witness is a minor the term includes
an appropriate family member as discussed in 7.3.2. The term “witness” does not include a
defense witness or an individual allegedly involved in a crime as a conspirator, accomplice, or
principal.
7.5. Offense. An offense is a crime punishable under the UCMJ committed by a person subject
to the UCMJ.
7.6. Responsible Official (RO). The Air Force official responsible for coordinating,
implementing and managing the Air Force VWAP. The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) is the
Air Force RO.
7.7. Local Responsible Official (LRO). The individual responsible for identifying victims and
witnesses of crimes and providing the services required by the VWAP. Each installation
commander or SPCMCA, as appropriate, is the LRO. LROs may delegate the LRO duties and
responsibilities to the SJA. The delegation must be in writing and addressed to the base SJA by
duty title rather than name. The SJA may further delegate the LRO duties and responsibilities in
writing to a VWAP Coordinator while maintaining oversight and overall responsibility for the
program. References in this chapter to the LRO include the SJA or VWAP Coordinator, if
 104                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


delegated LRO duties and responsibilities, and other individuals tasked by the LRO to assist with
the VWAP. See 2.4.1. when determining LROs for members of a stand-alone Air Reserve or Air
Reserve Base.
7.8. VWAP Coordinator. The individual selected by the SJA to implement and manage the
VWAP. Responsible for ensuring the accomplishment of required training by all local agencies.
The VWAP Coordinator may also serve as victim liaison as appropriate under the circumstances
of a particular case.
7.9. Victim Liaison. An individual appointed by the LRO or delegate, to assist a victim during
the military justice process. The designation need not be in writing. The liaison may be a
medical or mental health care provider, judge advocate, paralegal, or other person appropriate
under the circumstances of a particular case. A liaison is responsible for making contact between
victims and service agencies and arranging for those services, when appropriate.
Communications between a liaison and a victim are not confidential or privileged (See MRE 513
regarding the privilege in judicial proceedings for communications between psychotherapists and
patients).
7.10. Central Repository. A central organization for confinee information, charged with
establishing procedures to ensure victims, who so elect, are notified of changes in confinee
status. The USAF central repository is Headquarters Air Force Security Forces Center (HQ
AFSFC/SFC), Corrections Division/VWAP Central Repository, 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard,

Section 7D—Services Provided to Victims and Witnesses

7.12. LRO Responsibilities to Victims. The LRO, or other officials designated in this chapter,
shall:
   7.12.1. Designate a victim liaison to assist individual victims when necessary.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         105


  7.12.2. Inform the victim of the place where the victim may receive emergency medical and
  social service, and when necessary provide appropriate assistance in securing the care;
  7.12.3. Inform the victim of the availability of legal assistance in accordance with 10 U.S.C.
  § 1565b if they are otherwise eligible for legal assistance under AFI 51-504, Legal
  Assistance, Notary, and Preventive Law Programs.
  7.12.4. Inform the victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be
  entitled and how to obtain the relief.
     7.12.4.1. Restitution may be available from, or offered by, an accused as a condition in
     the terms of a PTA, during the sentencing process, as a part of post-trial mitigation (RCM
     1105), or as a term or condition of parole or clemency. SJAs provide information on
     possible restitution from local, state or federal crime victims’ funds, including procedures
     for applying for such funds.
     7.12.4.2. Inform victims that Article 139, UCMJ, may provide relief if the property loss
     or damage resulted from wrongful taking or willful damage by a member of the Armed
     Forces due to riotous, violent, or disorderly conduct. See Chapter 6, AFI 51-502,
     Personnel and Government Recovery Claims. Ensure an Article 139 investigation does
     not interfere with any criminal investigation or court-martial proceedings.
  7.12.5. Inform victims of intra-familial abuse offenses of the availability of limited
  transitional compensation benefits, waiver of mandatory forfeitures, and possible entitlement
  to a portion of the active duty member’s retirement benefits. See DoDI 1342.24.
  7.12.6. Inform the victim of available public and private counseling, treatment and support
  programs.
  7.12.7. Assist the victim in contacting agencies providing necessary services and relief.
  7.12.8. Inform the victim concerning protection from intimidation or similar threats, and, if
  appropriate, arrange for the victim to receive reasonable protection from an accused and from
  individuals acting in concert with the accused. Instruct the victim to immediately report any
  intimidation, harassment or similar conduct to military or civilian authorities. See 18 U.S.C.
  §§ 1512 and 1513.
     7.12.8.1. In cases where a victim’s life, well-being or safety is jeopardized or threatened
     by participation in the military justice process, the LRO ensures immediate notification of
     appropriate law enforcement agencies. Air Force law enforcement agencies promptly
     take measures to provide protection for the victim, as allowed by jurisdictional
     restrictions. Assist victims in obtaining restraining orders or similar protections available
     from civilian agencies.
  7.12.9. Provide the victim with the earliest possible notice of:
     7.12.9.1. The status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it will not interfere
     with the investigation and is appropriate;
     7.12.9.2. The accused’s pretrial status and any subsequent change in that status,
     including but not limited to, the accused being placed in pretrial confinement, being
     released from pretrial confinement, or escaping from pretrial confinement;
     7.12.9.3. Preferral and referral of charges or a decision not to pursue prosecution;
106                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


      7.12.9.4. A pretrial confinement hearing and/or Article 32 investigation, including

      martial proceeding the victim is entitled to or required to attend;
      7.12.9.6. The acceptance of a guilty plea or announcement of findings; and
      7.12.9.7. The sentence imposed, including the date on which the accused becomes
      eligible for release from confinement, or parole, if applicable.
  7.12.10. During trial proceedings provide the victim with:
      7.12.10.1. A waiting area removed from and out of the sight and hearing of the accused
      and defense witnesses; and
      7.12.10.2. Appropriate assistance in obtaining available services such as transportation,
      parking, child care, lodging, and courtroom translators or interpreters.
  7.12.11. If requested by the victim, take reasonable steps to inform the victim’s employer of
  the reasons for the victim’s absence from work. In appropriate cases, assist a victim
  subjected to serious financial strain directly resulting from a crime, or cooperation in the
  investigation or prosecution of an offense, in explaining reasons for financial strains to
  creditors. However, this does not entitle non-eligible victims to formal legal assistance, AFI
  51-504, Legal Assistance, Notary and Preventive Law Programs.
 7.12.12. Under ordinary circumstances, consult with the victim and obtain their view
 concerning:
      7.12.12.1. Decisions not to prefer charges;
      7.12.12.2. Dismissal of charges;
      7.12.12.3. Pretrial restraint or confinement, particularly an accused’s possible release
      from any pretrial restraint or confinement;
      7.12.12.4. Pretrial agreement negotiations, including PTA terms;
      7.12.12.5. Plea negotiations;
      7.12.12.6. Discharge or resignation in lieu of trial by court-martial; and
      7.12.12.7. Scheduling of judicial proceedings where the victim is required or entitled to
      attend.
 7.12.13. Consultation may be limited when it could endanger the safety of the victim or a
 witness, jeopardize an ongoing investigation, disclose classified or privileged information, or
 unduly delay disposition of an offense. Although the victims’ views should be considered,
 nothing in the VWAP limits the responsibility and authority of officials involved in the
 military justice process from taking any action deemed necessary in the interest of good order
 and discipline and the prevention of service-discrediting conduct.
 7.12.14. After trial, provide the victim the earliest possible notice of:
      7.12.14.1. Consideration of the accused by the SecAF Clemency and Parole Board for
      clemency or parole;
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          107


       7.12.14.2. The escape, work release, furlough, or any other form of release from custody
       of the accused; or,
       7.12.14.3. The death of the accused, if the accused dies while in custody.
   7.12.15. Ensure that any property of the victim that is being held for evidentiary purposes be
   maintained in good condition and returned to the victim as soon as it is no longer needed or
   required to be retained by law. See Section 586 of Public Law 112-81, “National Defense
   Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012,” December 16, 2011.
   7.12.16. Victims of crimes punishable under Article 120, UCMJ, who testified during the
   proceedings of a special or general court-martial are entitled to a copy of the record of
   proceedings without charge as soon as the records are authenticated. See 9.7.1.
   7.12.17. At the request of victims of crimes punishable under the remaining punitive articles
   (other than Article 120) of the UCMJ, provide the victim a copy of the record of trial, with
   appropriate Privacy Act redactions, after the convening authority has taken action.
7.13. Airman and Family Readiness Center (A&FRC) Responsibilities to Crime
Victims. The A&FRC maintains information on available treatment, counseling, and support
programs, acting as the focal point between victims and those programs. The A&FRC chief or a
designee works with other installation agencies to identify victims’ needs and determine
appropriate forms of assistance and resources available through military and community
services. The A&FRC provides information to victims on available medical, financial, legal, and
other social services, and assists victims in obtaining those services. At installations without an
A&FRC, the LRO appoints an individual to provide information to victims.
   7.13.1. In cases where referring a victim to the A&FRC for information may potentially
   cause undue embarrassment for the victim, LROs are encouraged to provide VWAP
   information directly to the victim.
7.14. Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program. It is Air Force and Department of
Defense policy to eliminate sexual assault within the Department of Defense by providing a
culture of prevention, education and training, response capability, victim support, reporting
procedures, and accountability that enhances the safety and well-being of all its members. A key
component of this policy is to provide an immediate, trained response capability for each report
of sexual assault in all locations, including deployed locations, and to ensure victims of sexual
assault are protected, treated with dignity and respect, and receive timely access to appropriate
treatment and services.
   7.14.1. Within the Air Force, the SARC implements and manages the installation level
   Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program (SAPR). In addition to assisting
   commanders in meeting annual sexual assault prevention and response training requirements,
   the SARC serves as the single point of contact for integrating and coordinating sexual assault
   victim care from an initial report of sexual assault, through disposition and resolution of
   issues related to the victim’s health and well-being.
   7.14.2. Air Force Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Victim Advocates (SAPR VAs)
   are appointed by the SARC to provide essential support, liaison services and care to the
   victim. Responsibilities include providing crisis intervention, referral and ongoing non-
   clinical support, including information on available options and resources to assist the victim
 108                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   in making informed decisions about the case. SAPR VA services will continue until the
   victim states support is no longer needed. SAPR VAs do not provide counseling or other
   professional services to a victim but refer the victim to the appropriate agency for clinical,
   legal, and other professional services. SAPR VAs may accompany the victim, at the victim’s
   request, during investigative interviews and medical examinations.
   7.14.3. The VWAP and SAPR programs are distinct but complementary programs providing
   support and services to the victims as required by their governing directives. The LRO, or
   other officials appointed in this chapter, and the SARC and SAPR VA, must work in concert
   to discharge their individual responsibilities and provide the victim appropriate information
   on available options and resources, notice of relevant events in the investigative and judicial
   processes, and support. The LRO, or any other official appointed in this chapter, remains
   responsible for the delivery of VWAP services.
7.15. LRO Responsibilities to Witnesses. The LRO or other officials designated in this
chapter shall:
   7.15.1. Inform eligible witnesses about protection from intimidation or similar threats, and,
   if appropriate, arrange for a witness to receive reasonable protection from an accused and
   from individuals acting in concert with or at the behest of the accused. Advise witnesses to
   immediately report any intimidation, harassment, or similar conduct to military authorities.
       7.15.1.1. In a case where a witness’ life, well-being, or safety is jeopardized or
       threatened by participation in the military justice process, the LRO ensures immediate
       notification to appropriate law enforcement agencies. Air Force law enforcement
       agencies promptly take measures to provide protection for the witness, as allowed by
       jurisdictional restrictions. Assist witnesses in obtaining restraining orders or similar
       protections available from civilian agencies. Inform witnesses of any changes in
       accused’s pretrial status, including, the accused being placed in pretrial confinement,
       being released from pretrial confinement, or escaping from pretrial confinement.
       7.15.1.2. If requested by a witness, take reasonable steps to inform the witness’ employer
       of the reasons for the witness’ absence from work. In appropriate cases, assist a witness
       subjected to serious financial strain directly resulting from a crime, or cooperation in the
       investigation or prosecution of an offense, in explaining reasons for financial strains to
       creditors. This does not entitle a non-eligible witness to formal legal assistance, under
       AFI 51-504, Legal Assistance, Notary and Preventive Law Programs.
       7.15.1.3. Provide witnesses with appropriate assistance in obtaining available services
       such as transportation, parking, child care, lodging, and courtroom translators or
       interpreters.
       7.15.1.4. To the extent possible and when appropriate, afford witnesses the opportunity
       to wait in an area separate from the accused or defense witnesses to avoid
       embarrassment, coercion, or similar emotional distress.
       7.15.1.5. Inform witnesses of the time and place of each trial proceeding the witness is
       either required or entitled to attend. Promptly notify the witness of any scheduling
       changes.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                        109


   7.15.2. Determine the extent to which each individual witness is provided services or
   information under this paragraph. For example, active duty military, expert, or character
   witnesses ordinarily do not require all these services.
   7.15.3. Provide information and services to witnesses for a suspect or accused, if requested
   by defense counsel, and authorized by the LRO.
7.16. LRO Responsibilities to Others Entitled to Notice. Witnesses, relatives of victims and
witnesses who are minors, and relatives of homicide victims are entitled to receive prompt
notification of information concerning cases. If requested, the LRO or other officials designated
in this chapter shall notify the individuals of the following:
   7.16.1. Apprehension of a suspect or an accused.
   7.16.2. Initial appearance of an accused before a pretrial confinement review officer or other
   judicial official.
   7.16.3. Pretrial release of an accused, or any changes in pretrial restrictions.
   7.16.4. Court-martial proceedings, including:
       7.16.4.1. Any pleas by the accused;
       7.16.4.2. Findings; and
       7.16.4.3. The sentence imposed, including the date on which the accused becomes
       eligible for release from confinement, or parole, if applicable.

Section 7E—Notifications, Form Processing, and Miscellaneous Information

7.17. Law Enforcement and Investigative Personnel. At the earliest opportunity after
identification of a crime victim or witness and when appropriate, law enforcement and
investigative personnel shall provide to each victim and witness DD Form 2701, Initial
Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime. The number of DD Forms 2701 distributed
annually is reported to the base SJA or equivalent. Therefore, the date this information is
provided to the victim or witness shall be annotated on any incident report form. When
circumstances dictate, law enforcement and investigative personnel shall promptly inform all
victims about the availability of emergency medical care and applicable social services. When
necessary, secure the assistance of the A&FRC or victim liaison in obtaining available services
in the military and/or civilian community.
7.18. Government Trial Counsel or Designee.
   7.18.1. Prior to trial, the government trial counsel or designee provides the victim with a DD
   Form 2702, Court-Martial Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime, explaining
   victims’ rights and access to services. The number of DD Forms 2702 distributed annually is
   reported to the base SJA or equivalent.
   7.18.2. Witnesses requested or ordered to appear at Article 32 investigations or courts-
   martial may be entitled to reimbursement for their expenses under Articles 46 and 47, UCMJ,
   and RCM 405(g). Provide victims and witnesses assistance in obtaining prompt payment of
   witness fees and related costs. When possible, establish local procedures for paying
 110                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   vouchers after normal duty hours when necessary to avoid undue hardship. See generally,
   Chapter 6, paragraphs 6.2. to 6.5.
   7.18.3. The government trial counsel or designee provides a victim with a DD Form 2703,
   Post-Trial Information for Victims and Witnesses of Crime, explaining the victim’s post-trial
   rights. The number of DD Forms 2703 distributed annually is reported to the base SJA or
   equivalent.
   7.18.4. For all cases resulting in a sentence to confinement, the government trial counsel or
   designee completes DD Form 2704, Victim/Witness Certification and Election Concerning
   Inmate Status. Send one copy of the form to the Central Repository, Headquarters Air Force
   Security Forces Center (HQ AFSFC/SFC), 1517 Billy Mitchell Boulevard, Lackland AFB
   TX, 78236-0119, one copy to the confinement facility where the accused is in post-trial
   confinement and give a redacted copy to the victim or witness. The victim’s/witness’s copy
   must not contain the accused’s SSN or any information concerning other victims or
   witnesses.
       7.18.4.1. The date the DD Form 2704 is given to the victim or witness must be recorded
       and the number of DD Forms 2704 distributed annually reported to the base SJA or
       equivalent.
       7.18.4.2. Do not attach a copy of the DD Form 2704 to any portion of any record to
       which the convicted member has access, including the ROT. Doing so could endanger
       the victim or witness. The DD Form 2704 is exempt from release under the Freedom of
       Information Act (FOIA).
7.19. Additional Confinement Notification Requirements.
   7.19.1. If the sentence includes confinement, the SJA or VWAP coordinator is responsible
   for informing the victim of the convening authority’s action on the findings and sentence of
   the court-martial, regardless of where the accused is confined when action is taken.
   7.19.2. Upon an offender’s entry into confinement, the VWAP coordinator at the military
   confinement facility shall obtain the DD Form 2704 to determine victim or witness
   notification requirements. If the form is unavailable, inquire of HQ AFSFC/SFC whether
   any victim or witness has requested notification of changes in the confinee status in the case.
   Clearly mark an individual’s confinement records to indicate the case involves a victim who
   wants to be informed of the inmate’s status.
   7.19.3. If an accused is confined at or near the installation where tried, the installation SF
   commander notifies the victim of an accused’s escape, any form of release from custody, or
   death.
   7.19.4. When a victim or witness has requested notification of changes in confinee status on
   the DD Form 2704, and that status changes as listed below, use the DD Form 2705, Victim
   and Witness Notification of Inmate Status, to notify the victim or witness. The date
   notifications are given must be recorded and the number of DD Forms 2705 distributed
   annually reported to the base SJA or equivalent. Provide the earliest possible notice of:
       7.19.4.1. The scheduling of a clemency or parole hearing for the inmate.
       7.19.4.2. The transfer of the inmate from one facility to another.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                        111


       7.19.4.3. The escape (and subsequent return to custody), work release, furlough, or any

   Repository, HQ AFSFC/SFC, annually.
   7.19.7. Victims are entitled to provide input to an accused’s disposition board prior to a
   parole eligibility date or the accused going before the Air Force Clemency and Parole Board.
   Each victim is responsible to keep HQ AFSFC/SFC informed of the victim’s current address.
7.20. Local Civilian Agencies. LROs are encouraged to enter into an appropriate memorandum
of agreement with local civilian agencies to ensure cooperative relationships in identifying,
reporting, investigating, and providing services and treatment to victims and witnesses.

Section 7F—Training and Self-Inspection

7.21. Training.
   7.21.1. General. All personnel involved in the military criminal justice process and those
   responsible for providing required services to victims and witnesses must be familiar with the
   requirements of the Air Force VWAP. The LRO is responsible for developing and
   implementing a program at each installation. The LRO is also responsible for ensuring the
   accomplishment of required annual training by all local agencies.
   7.21.2. Development of the Training Program. The installation SJA, Chief of Security
   Forces (SF), Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) detachment commander,
   medical facility commander (SG), Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC), Family
   Advocacy Program (FAP), Airman and Family Readiness Center director (A&FRC),
   installation chaplain (HC) and representatives from commanders and first sergeants develop
   local training programs to ensure compliance with the VWAP. Figure 7.2 provides a list of
   references for use in developing a training program.
   7.21.3. Accomplishment of Training. Each individual agency is responsible for training the
   agency’s personnel on their responsibilities under this chapter annually. The SJA trains
   commanders and first sergeants annually. The LRO coordinates all training required by this
   chapter and ensures the provisions of this chapter are publicized to all military and civilian
   agencies providing victim and witness services within their communities.
   7.21.4. Preparation of Victim Information Packet. Prepare a victim information packet at
   each installation through the coordinated efforts of the SJA, SF, AFOSI, SARC, FAP, SG,
   A&FRC, HC and commanders and first sergeants. Provide the packet to each identified
 112                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   victim or witness. See Figure 7.3 for a model packet, which may be used as a starting point
   for a victim or witness handout depending on local circumstances.
   7.21.5. Training Requirements for Investigative and Law Enforcement Personnel.
   Investigative and law enforcement personnel are often the first individuals to have contact
   with the victims of crimes. Their training must emphasize responsibilities to victims. At the
   earliest opportunity after detection of a crime and without interfering with the investigation,
   investigative and law enforcement personnel should make all efforts to:
       7.21.5.1. Identify the victim of a crime.
       7.21.5.2. Inform the victim of the name, title, business address and telephone number of
       the A&FRC director or the victim liaison (or the SARC or FAP when applicable) to
       whom a request for services should be addressed and assist the victim in making contact
       with those individuals when necessary.
       7.21.5.3. Inform the victim of available emergency medical and or social services.
       7.21.5.4. Inform the victim of the right to receive reasonable protection for the victim or
       witness whose life, well-being, or safety is jeopardized by participation in the military
       justice process.
   7.21.6. Funding for victim and witness assistance programs is an operations and
   maintenance-type expense.
7.22. Self-Inspection. Responsible Officials should develop a system for assessing the
effectiveness of their victim and witness assistance program . Additionally, liaisons should keep
a record of each case involving victim(s), witness(es), and/or others entitled to notice that shows
that they have complied with the notification requirements listed in this chapter. It is
recommended that Responsible Officials track the dates information packets (to include DD
Forms 2701-2703) and notifications were provided (with copies of all applicable notification
letters and indorsements). Responsible Officials are required to utilize and maintain the VWAP
Self-Inspection Checklist at Figure 7.4.
   7.22.1. Staff assistance visits will examine the effectiveness of victim and witness assistance
   programs, as well as compliance with this instruction.

Section 7H—Administrative Disposition

7.24. Disclosure of Administrative Disposition. In cases where allegations against a suspect
are disposed of other than by trial, a victim or witness may want to be informed of the alternate
disposition. Victims and witnesses should be provided as much relevant information as possible,
consistent with the privacy rights of the accused. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. § 552a (the
Privacy Act), records and information related to Article 15 punishment and administrative
discharge proceedings may be disclosed as a routine use to victims and witnesses of a crime for
the purposes of providing information consistent with the requirements of VWAP and the
Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990. When analyzing Privacy Act exceptions, consider
the Air Force’s interest in fostering cooperation of victims and witnesses in the instant case,
whether the accused has made any disclosures about the action or disposition that would
diminish his/her expectation of privacy, and other relevant factors. Because each case presents
unique facts and circumstances, decisions to release information must be reviewed on an
individualized basis, in light of the Privacy Act and the exceptions allowing disclosure, as
provided therein.

                                           Chapter 8

                                      TRIAL MATTERS

Section 8A—Changes to and Withdrawal of Charges and Specifications after Referral to Trial

8.1. Changes. Minor and major changes may be made to charges and/or specifications after
referral as authorized and explained in RCM 603. Changes should be made by lining through the
material while ensuring the form remains legible. All changes and modifications should be dated
and initialed by the trial counsel with the permission of the convening authority. Do not use
white-out tape or liquid for minor or major changes.
   8.1.1. Minor Changes. Make minor changes to a charge and/or specification on the charge
   sheet. Initial and date the change. Minor changes may be accomplished without having the
   charge sworn anew by the accuser. Promptly provide copies of the charge sheet with the
   changes to the accused and defense counsel. After arraignment, only a military judge may
   authorize minor changes to the charge sheet.
   8.1.2. Major Changes. Major changes or amendments to a charge and/or specification
   cannot be made over the objection of the accused unless the charge and/or specification
   affected are preferred anew. A new referral will also be necessary and, in the case of a
   GCM, a new Article 32 investigation will be required if the charge and/or specification, as
   changed, was not covered in the prior investigation.
       8.1.2.1. Make a major change or amendment to a charge and/or specification on the
       original charge sheet. Initial and date the change. If the accused objects to the change, a
       new preferral and referral of the changed or amended charge and/or specification must be
       accomplished by attaching an indorsement to the original charge sheet containing the
       following matters: a new preferral, notification to the accused, receipt by summary
       court-martial convening authority, referral, and service under RCM 602.
       8.1.2.2. Even if an accused does not object to a major change or amendment, it may be
       prudent to prefer anew. Re-preferral and re-referral may avoid a jurisdictional issue as to
       whether the accused was improperly tried for a charge never referred to trial by the
       convening authority in an actual order or functional equivalent. United States v. Wilkins,
       29 M.J. 421 (C.M.A. 1990).
8.2. Withdrawal. Before findings are announced, a convening authority may cause any charges
or specifications to be withdrawn from a court-martial. RCM 604. Withdrawal of charges or
specifications extinguishes the jurisdiction of a court-martial over them, unlike a dismissal that
extinguishes the charges themselves. Withdrawn charges and/or specifications should be
disposed of promptly (e.g., dismissed, re-referred to another court-martial, or forwarded to
another convening authority for disposition). An officer authorized to sign referrals or trial
counsel may withdraw charges and/or specifications at the direction of the convening authority.
   8.2.1. Complete Withdrawal. To withdraw all charges and specifications from a court-
   martial, trial counsel lines through the referral section (Part V) of the charge sheet, specifies
   the disposition and the date, and initials the action taken (e.g., “Withdrawn on 15 Sep 11,
   [initials]”). If the convening authority or a superior competent authority directs both
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           123


   withdrawal and dismissal of all charges and specifications, reflect accordingly (e.g.,
   “Withdrawn and Dismissed on 15 Sep 11, [initials]”).
   8.2.2. Partial Withdrawal. To withdraw a specific charge and/or specification from a court-
   martial, while allowing the other offense(s) to proceed to trial, line through the affected
   charge and/or specification, specify the disposition and the date, and initial the action taken.
   (e.g., “Withdrawn on 15 Sep 11, [initials]”). If the convening authority directs both
   withdrawal and dismissal of a particular charge and/or specification, reflect accordingly (e.g.,
   “Withdrawn and Dismissed on 15 Sep 11, [initials]”). The trial counsel must determine
   whether any remaining charges and/or specifications should be renumbered (and if
   renumbered, initial the renumbering). The following rules apply to renumbering charges
   and/or specifications:
       8.2.2.1. When charges and/or specifications are withdrawn before arraignment, the
       remaining charges and/or specifications must be renumbered and the new numbers
       reflected on the charge sheet and throughout the ROT.
       8.2.2.2. When charges and/or specifications are withdrawn after arraignment and after
       they have come to the attention of court members (or the military judge sitting alone), the
       remaining charges and/or specifications should not be renumbered. The military judge
       instructs the members that the withdrawn charges and/or specifications should not be
       considered for any reason.
       8.2.2.3. When charges and/or specifications are withdrawn after arraignment but before
       the court members are aware of the charges, the remaining charges and/or specifications
       should, at the direction of the military judge, be renumbered. The new numbers should
       be reflected on the charge sheet and referred to throughout the ROT from the point of
       renumbering. If the military judge directs renumbering, withdrawn charges and/or
       specifications should not be brought to the attention of the members. If the military judge
       does not direct renumbering, the remaining charges and/or specifications should not be
       renumbered and the military judge instructs the members that they should not draw any
       inference from the numbering of the charges and/or specifications.

Section 8B—Conditional Guilty Plea

8.3. Conditional Guilty Plea. RCM 910(a)(2); United States v. Monroe, 50 M.J. 550 (A.F. Ct.
Crim. App. 1999) and United States v. Phillips, 32 M.J. 955 (A.F.C.M.R. 1991). When
approving a guilty plea conditioned on preserving review of an adverse determination of a
pretrial motion, the military judge should make the following findings on the record: (1) the
offer is in writing and clearly details the motion that the accused wishes to preserve on appeal;
(2) the government’s consent is in writing and signed by an official authorized to consent; (3) the
particular motion was fully litigated before the military judge; and, (4) the motion is case
dispositive. The SJA or the person “Acting as the Staff Judge Advocate” to the convening
authority, or the trial counsel at the direction of the SJA or the person “Acting as the Staff Judge
Advocate”, is authorized to consent for the government to the accused entering a conditional
guilty plea.

Section 8C—Pretrial Agreements (RCM 705)
 124                                                                  AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


8.4. Policy Considerations. Use caution whenever a pretrial agreement (PTA) is being
considered.
   8.4.1. SJAs have an obligation to preserve a military justice system that promotes good order
   and discipline and is fair, timely, and transparent to the military community and the public at
   large. There are many undesirable aspects associated with the use of a PTA in a criminal
   trial; not the least of which is the impression often created by such an agreement that the
   interests of justice are being compromised. The advantages to both the government and the
   accused should clearly outweigh the unattractive features of a PTA. The SJA must be able to
   articulate to the convening authority the benefits to the government and the accused as well
   as the costs to the military justice system of entering a PTA in order to properly balance the
   considerations; otherwise any articulable benefit makes a PTA seem attractive. PTAs should
   not be used to mask case processing inefficiencies.
   8.4.2. The use of a PTA may be advisable in the following situations:
       8.4.2.1. Cases where the victim of crime is traumatized and experts advise the
       government that participation in the trial process will cause further trauma.
       8.4.2.2. Cases where sensational information involving innocent persons can be avoided
       through a negotiated plea.
       8.4.2.3. Cases where several accused are involved, and the testimony of one is required
       in the trial of one or more of the others. In this case, a plea agreement may be more
       desirable than a grant of immunity.
       8.4.2.4. Cases where essential witnesses are located at exceptional distances, are not
       amenable to process or are not otherwise available. Current operations, in some
       circumstances, may make critical witnesses unavailable.
       8.4.2.5. Cases involving national security where harm to the government of a fully
       litigated trial should be avoided. In these cases, pretrial agreements can be used so that
       evidence involving exposure of national security information can be protected.
   8.4.3. Cost, expediency, collateral consequences, forum selection, and litigation risk are all
   factors the SJA and the CA need to consider in determining whether a PTA is warranted.
   However, individually they are not ordinarily factors that outweigh the detrimental aspects of
   PTAs.
   8.4.4. PTAs that would include a provision for waiver of mandatory forfeitures must be
   carefully scrutinized to ensure the accused’s expectations will be met. For example, when an
   accused enters a no-pay status upon the expiration of his or her term of service, there will be
   no pay available to forfeit, and therefore no amount to waive for the benefit of dependents.
   An agreement predicated upon terms including a waiver that is thwarted due to no pay
   entitlement may render pleas by an accused improvident and result in reversal of a
   conviction. United States v. Mitchell, 58 M.J. 251 (C.A.A.F. 2003); United States v. Perron,
   58 M.J. 78 (C.A.A.F. 2003).
   8.4.5. Defense Offer. The SJA, trial counsel, and counsel for the accused may clarify the
   terms of a defense PTA offer to obtain sufficient information to enable the convening
   authority to decide whether to reject the offer or request permission to negotiate.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          125


8.5. Authorization Required To Enter into PTA Discussion in National Security and
Related Cases.
   8.5.1. In General. The Chief, Military Justice Division (AFLOA/JAJM), must grant
   permission to enter into PTA discussions in cases involving an offense (including attempt,
   conspiracy, and solicitation to commit such an offense) of espionage, subversion, aiding the
   enemy, sabotage, spying, or violation of punitive rules or regulations and criminal statutes
   concerning classified information or the foreign relations of the United States.
   AFLOA/JAJM ensures coordination with DoJ according to DoD Instruction 5525.7.
   AFLOA/JAJM permission is not required for the convening authority to reject a PTA offer.
   8.5.2. Request for Permission to Negotiate. The GCMCA personally or through his or her
   SJA requests permission to negotiate a possible PTA from AFLOA/JAJM by the most
   expeditious means available. Include the following information in the request:
       8.5.2.1. Background information on the accused including name, rank and organization;
       8.5.2.2. The offenses charged;
       8.5.2.3. A summary of evidence against the accused;
       8.5.2.4. Terms of the accused’s PTA offer; and,
       8.5.2.5. Factors warranting a PTA.
   8.5.3. Permission to Proceed. A grant of permission to enter into PTA discussions does not
   amount to approval of the terms or conditions of any PTA, which may result from the
   negotiations.
8.6. Authority to Conclude Agreement. Unless withheld by a superior authority, GCMCAs
and SPCMCAs are authorized to enter into or reject offers to enter into PTAs with the accused.
The decision to accept or reject a PTA offer submitted by an accused is within the sole discretion
of the convening authority that referred the case to trial. United States v. Caruth, 6 M.J. 184
(C.M.A. 1979). The accused is entitled to have the convening authority personally act upon the
offer before trial. United States v. Upchurch, 23 M.J. 501 (A.F.C.M.R. 1986).
8.7. Terms and Format. See RCM 705(b) and (c) for terms and conditions which may be in a
PTA. PTAs must be in writing and signed by the accused and counsel. When a convening
authority accepts a PTA, the convening authority personally signs it, unless the convening
authority previously authorized another individual such as the SJA or trial counsel to sign. If the
SJA or trial counsel signs the PTA, use an authority line such as “FOR THE COMMANDER.”
Oral PTAs are prohibited, as are promises to intervene on the accused’s behalf in any manner in
exchange for a guilty plea. Include all documentation pertaining to a PTA, including Appendix
A, changes, or modifications, in the ROT. Figure 8.1 is a sample PTA, but it may be modified to
fit the circumstances of a case. However, modification of Figure 8.1 should be undertaken very
cautiously; the sample language reflects generally required and legally acceptable agreement
terms.
   8.7.1. Changes in PTA. If the negotiation results in an agreement for different relief for the
   accused than such included in the original offer, prepare and sign a different offer and/or
   Appendix A reflecting the agreed terms. If only a new Appendix A is prepared, the date of
   the original offer will still appear in the first paragraph of Appendix A. If another Appendix
   A or offer is prepared, attach the original Appendix A or offer to the ROT as an allied paper.
 126                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   8.7.2. Stipulations of Fact. In order to make members and the military judge, when sitting
   alone, sufficiently aware of the circumstances of the offenses with which an accused is
   charged, the convening authority may require the accused and counsel to enter into
   stipulations of fact or testimony as a part of the PTA. RCM 705(c)(2)(A).
8.8. Withdrawal from PTAs. Either party may withdraw from a PTA as provided in RCM
705(d)(4). Withdrawals by the convening authority must be in writing and signed by the
convening authority. Give a copy to the accused and defense counsel. Withdrawals by the
accused should be in writing and given to the SJA or trial counsel. The PTA and the withdrawal,
by either side, should be included in the ROT as a pretrial allied paper. AFMAN 51-203, Figure
4.1.
   8.8.1. Post-Trial Matters. If the accused does not fulfill a promise to conform his or her
   conduct to certain conditions before action or during any period of suspension of the
   sentence, as agreed to in the PTA, the convening authority may be relieved of the obligation
   to fulfill the PTA. However, the accused’s promise must be included in the PTA and there
   must be compliance with the hearing requirements in RCM 1109 before an alleged violation
   by the accused may relieve the convening authority of the obligation to fulfill the agreement.
   RCM 705(c)(2)(D); United States v. Smith, 46 M.J. 263 (C.A.A.F. 1997); United States v.
   Hunter, 65 M.J. 399 (C.A.A.F. 2008); United States v. Shook, 70 M.J. 578 (A.F. Ct. Crim.
   App. 2011).
8.9. In-Court Inquiry. Notify the military judge of a PTA before arraignment. The military
judge must question the accused prior to accepting the plea to determine whether the accused
understands and agrees to the meaning and effect of each PTA condition and the agreed upon
sentence limitations. In a trial by military judge alone, the military judge should not inquire into
the actual sentence limitations specified in the plea agreement until after sentence announcement.
PTAs that are subject to in-court inquiry, whether or not accepted by the military judge, are
appellate exhibits in the ROT. See RCM 705(e) for PTA nondisclosure requirements.

Section 8D—Evidentiary Matters

8.10. Confidential Drug or Alcohol Abuse Records. Federal statutes and regulations restrict
the disclosure of records as to the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of drug and alcohol
abusers under the Federal drug and alcohol abuse prevention programs. Refer to 42 U.S.C. §
290dd-2 and 42 C.F.R. § 2.12.
   8.10.1. Although the interchange of records entirely within the Armed Forces are exempt
   from the prohibitions in paragraph 8.10, the Department of Defense adopted the standards as
   a matter of policy to the extent it provides such records may not be used to initiate or
   substantiate any criminal charges against the rehabilitant, except as authorized by a court
   order issued under 42 U.S.C. § 290dd-2 and as allowed in AFI 44-120, Military Drug
   Demand Reduction Program, (implementing DoDD 1010.1, Military Personnel Drug Abuse
   Testing Program).
   8.10.2. Disclosure of these records is permitted at the request of, and with written consent of,
   the accused-patient:
       8.10.2.1. As evidence for the defense before findings.
       8.10.2.2. As evidence in mitigation or extenuation in pre-sentencing proceedings.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           127


       8.10.2.3. After trial in support of clemency or clemency petitions to TJAG or SecAF.
   8.10.3. Follow the procedure outlined in 42 C.F.R. § 2.31 in authorizing release of the
   records by the accused-patient. Avoid discussion of the records in open court to the extent
   feasible.
   8.10.4. Only release necessary and relevant portions of the records for purposes of paragraph
   8.10.2. An accused cannot selectively authorize disclosure of the records to mislead the
   court or other parties to the trial (e.g., disclosing favorable early records, but not later ones
   indicating regression). If there is reason to believe an accused is selectively authorizing
   disclosure, either resolve the matters among counsel, or by an in camera review of the
   records by the military judge.
   8.10.5. Drug and alcohol abuse records may be disclosed at trial without the consent of the
   accused to rebut or impeach evidence presented by the accused. United States v. Evans, 20
   M.J. 504 (A.F.C.M.R. 1985); United States v. Fenyo, 6 M.J. 933 (A.F.C.M.R. 1979), pet.
   denied, 7 M.J. 161 (C.M.A. 1979).
8.11. Psychotherapist-Patient Confidentiality. When psychotherapist-patient communications
are involved, consult the psychotherapist-patient privilege under MRE 513 and, when applicable,
the evidentiary protections and limitations extended to an accused entered in the Limited
Privilege Suicide Prevention Program (LPSP) under AFI 44-109, Mental Health and Military
Law.
   8.11.1. MRE 513 is a limited evidentiary privilege protecting confidential communications
   between a patient and a psychotherapist, or an assistant to a psychotherapist, if the
   communications were made for the purpose of facilitating diagnosis or treatment of the
   patient’s mental or emotional condition. It applies only to communications made after 1
   November 1999. While the privilege broadly applies to all “patients,” including military
   members, the privilege is narrowed by eight exceptions enumerated in the rule. If an
   exception applies, no privilege under the rule exists to preclude disclosure.
   8.11.2. MRE 513 provides that the privilege applies only to “case[s] arising under the
   UCMJ.” It extends to all stages of a proceeding under the UCMJ, including law enforcement
   investigations into suspected offenses, proceedings for search authorizations, nonjudicial
   punishment proceedings, court-martial actions, and other proceedings enumerated in MRE
   1101. MRE 513 has no application outside such UCMJ proceedings. As stated in the
   MCM’s Analysis to this rule, “there is no intent to apply Rule 513 in any proceeding other
   than those authorized under the UCMJ. . . . Rule 513 applies only to UCMJ proceedings, and
   do[es] not limit the availability of such information internally to the services, for appropriate
   purposes.” MCM, Appendix 22.
   8.11.3. Therefore, the MRE 513 privilege has no application if access to the confidential
   communications between a military member and a psychotherapist is sought for a non-
   UCMJ-related purpose. In these situations, confidential communications should be disclosed
   to persons or agencies with a proper and legitimate need for the information and authorized
   by law or regulation to receive them. When UCMJ proceedings are pending against the
   member whose confidential communications are being sought for a non-UCMJ-related
   purpose, no privilege applies.
 128                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   8.11.4. Disputes between a requestor and a psychotherapist or patient may arise over the
   disclosure of confidential communications. AFI 44-109 has established procedures that
   address this issue. The installation SJA is authorized to resolve the dispute and determine
   whether disclosure should be made. When the request is for non-UCMJ purposes, the focus
   should be on whether the requestor has a proper and legitimate need for the confidential
   communications and is authorized by law or regulation to receive them. When the request
   seeks disclosure for UCMJ purposes, the SJA’s focus should be on whether an enumerated
   exception in MRE 513 authorizes disclosure. The SJA, in UCMJ cases, must guard against
   improper disclosures to investigators and trial counsel that may “poison the case” with
   inadmissible evidence.
   8.11.5. The MRE 513 privilege also interacts with the protections afforded members in the
   LPSP Program. Confidential communications of members in the LPSP program cannot be
   used against them in a UCMJ action, even if an exception in MRE 513 applies. Members
   may be entered into the program once they are officially notified that they are either under
   investigation or suspected of committing an offense under the UCMJ.
8.12. Confidentiality of Sexual Assault Program Records. When communications between
an alleged victim of sexual assault and a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) and/or
Victim Advocate (VA) are involved, consult the confidential reporting program for victims of
sexual assault established by DoDD 6495.01, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR)
Program, and Department of the Air Force Policies and Procedures for the Prevention of and
Response to Sexual Assault.
   8.12.1. A victim has a privilege to refuse to disclose, and to prevent any other person from
   disclosing, a confidential communication made between the victim and a victim advocate, in
   a case arising under the UCMJ, if such communication was made for the purpose of
   facilitating advice or supportive assistance to the victim. See M.R.E. 515.
   8.12.2. Restricted reporting allows a sexual assault victim to confidentially disclose the
   details of his or her assault to specified individuals and receive medical treatment and
   counseling, without triggering the official investigative process. Service members who are
   sexually assaulted and desire restricted reporting under this policy may only report the
   assault to the SARC, VA or a health care provider (HCP). In cases where a victim elects
   restricted reporting, the SARC, assigned VA (whether uniformed or civilian), and HCPs may
   not disclose covered communications to law enforcement or command authorities, either
   within or outside the Department of Defense, except as provided by the DoDI and/or AF
   Policy.
   8.12.3. In the event confidential information as defined in paragraphs 8.12.1 and 8.12.2 is
   required to be disclosed, the disclosure will be limited to information necessary to satisfy the
   purpose of the disclosure in the event an authorized disclosure is made.
       8.12.3.1. Disclosure may be made to:
          8.12.3.1.1. Command officials or law enforcement (including SF and AFOSI or other
          criminal investigative service) when the disclosure is authorized in writing by the
          victim;
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            129


           8.12.3.1.2. Command officials or law enforcement when disclosure is necessary to
           prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of the
           individual or another;
           8.12.3.1.3. Disability Retirement Boards and officials when disclosure by a
           healthcare provider is required for fitness for duty for disability retirement
           determinations, limited to only that information which is necessary to process the
           disability retirement determination;
           8.12.3.1.4. SARC, VAs or healthcare provider when disclosure is necessary for the
           supervision of direct victim services; and/or
           8.12.3.1.5. Military or civilian courts of competent jurisdiction when disclosure is
           ordered by a military, Federal, or State judge, or other officials or entities as required
           by a Federal or State statute or applicable U.S. international agreement.
   8.12.4. The SARC, assigned VA, and HCP will consult with the servicing legal office, in the
   same manner as other recipients of privileged information, to determine if the exception
   criteria apply. Until those determinations are made, only non-identifying information should
   be disclosed. When there is uncertainty or disagreement on whether an exception applies, the
   matter shall be resolved IAW AFI 36-6001, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR)
   Program, Chapter 3.

Section 8E—Pre-sentencing Matters (RCM 1001)

8.13. Personnel Data and Character of Prior Service. “Personnel records of the accused,” as
referenced in RCM 1001, includes all those records made or maintained in accordance with Air
Force directives that reflect the past military efficiency, conduct, performance, and history of the
accused, as well as any evidence of disciplinary actions, including punishment under Article 15,
UCMJ, and previous court-martial convictions.
   8.13.1. Personnel Information File. Relevant material contained in an accused’s unit
   personnel information file (PIF) may be admitted pursuant to RCM 1001(b) if:
       8.13.1.1. Counsel provided a copy of the document or made the document available to
       opposing counsel prior to trial; and
       8.13.1.2. There is some evidence in the document or attached to it that:
           8.13.1.2.1. The accused received a copy of the correspondence (a document bearing
           the signature of the accused, or a witnessed statement regarding the accused’s refusal
           to sign, would meet this criterion) and had the opportunity to respond to the
           allegation; and,
           8.13.1.2.2. The document is not over 5 years old on the date the charges were
           referred to trial.
       8.13.1.3. Relevant material contained in an accused’s PIF may be admitted under RCM
       1001(d) for rebuttal purposes, even if it does not comply with 8.13.1.2.1. and 8.13.1.2.2.,
       if, in the military judge’s discretion, other competent means of authenticating the material
       have been presented to the court. United States v. Strong, 17 M.J. 263 (C.M.A. 1984).
 130                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   8.13.2. Nonjudicial Punishment. Records of punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, from any
   file in which the record is properly maintained by regulation, may be admitted if not over 5
   years old on the date the charges were referred. Measure this time period from the date the
   commander notified the accused of the commander’s intent to impose nonjudicial
   punishment. Exclude periods in which the accused is absent without authority in computing
   the 5-year period. If the PIF contains an AF Form 366, Record of Proceedings of Vacation of
   Suspended Nonjudicial Punishment, which meets this five-year requirement, a copy of the
   Article 15 record imposing the punishment vacated is also admissible, regardless of whether
   the original Article 15 action was served on the accused within this time period. Nothing in
   this paragraph precludes use of Article 15 actions over five years old as rebuttal evidence
   pursuant to RCM 1001(d).
   8.13.3. Performance Reports. Trial counsel offers all Enlisted or Officer Performance
   Reports maintained according to departmental directives, as evidence of the character of the
   accused's prior service. RCM 1001(b)(2); United States v. Wingart, 27 M.J. 128 (C.M.A.
   1988).
   8.13.4. Previous Convictions. The DD Form 493, Extract of Military Records of Previous
   Convictions, may be used to introduce evidence of an accused’s previous conviction. Do not
   offer evidence of a previous conviction by SCM, in which counsel did not represent the
   accused, unless the accused waived the right to counsel. United States v. Booker, 5 M.J. 238,
   246 (C.M.A. 1977). A conviction by SCM is not admissible until reviewed pursuant to
   Article 64(a), UCMJ. See also RCM 1001(b)(3).
8.14. Hate Crimes. Trial counsel may present evidence in aggravation that the accused
intentionally selected a victim or any property as the object of the offense because of the actual
or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual
orientation of any person. RCM 1001(b)(4).

Section 8F—Officer Resignations for the Good of the Service (RILOs)

8.15. RILOs. Officers may submit a RILO with the understanding that SecAF may direct a
discharge under other than honorable conditions (UOTHC) when their conduct makes them
subject to trial by court-martial. (See Figure 8.2) Officers must understand that if SecAF
accepts their resignation they may be required to reimburse a portion of advanced education
assistance, special pay, or bonuses received if they leave active duty before completing the
period of active duty they agreed to serve. See AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge
Procedures for Commissioned Officers, for complete recoupment guidance. Officers who are
subject to recoupment of education assistance, special pay, or bonuses must sign a Recoupment
Statement and attach it to their resignation memorandum. (See Figure 8.4).
   8.15.1. Commanders should not recommend that SecAF accept a RILO for expediency when
   the member’s conduct would be more appropriately addressed at trial. Before making any
   recommendations, commanders at all levels must consider the best interests of the Air Force
   and the effect a resignation accepted by SecAF will have on good order and discipline. The
   expense of a court-martial should rarely be the deciding factor in making a recommendation
   on a tendered resignation under this paragraph. To permit the full development of the facts
   of the case and appropriate consideration of dispositions other than trial, officers are
   encouraged not to tender a resignation for the good of the service before charges are referred
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                     131


  to trial by court-martial. SPCMCAs, GCMCAs and MAJCOM commanders are authorized
  to deny RILOs submitted prior to the referral of charges. If denied, the officer may again
  submit a RILO after referral of charges. Once referral of charges occurs, RILOs may only be
  acted upon at the Secretarial level. A RILO may not be submitted post-arraignment.
  8.15.2. Procedure. Forward all pre-referral RILOs, in which approval is recommended, and
  all post-referral officer RILOs expeditiously to AFLOA/JAJM through command channels.
  NOTE: Legal offices at each level of command shall use the Comprehensive RILO Checklist
  located on the AFLOA/JAJM website.
     8.15.2.1. Transmit a signed copy of the RILO package to AFLOA/JAJM through
     command channels. In addition to the officer’s resignation and any supporting
     documents submitted by the officer, the RILO package should include (as applicable)
     copies of:
         8.15.2.1.1. Any reports of investigation, statements, or other documents supporting
         the charges or accusations against the officer;
         8.15.2.1.2. The charge sheet, forwarding letters and any indorsements with
         attachments, including the personal data sheet on the officer;
         8.15.2.1.3. The report of the Article 32 investigation with attachments;
         8.15.2.1.4. Recommendations on disposition of the RILO from each commander
         required to review the RILO;
            8.15.2.1.4.1. The wing commander or equivalent authority indorses the
            resignation to the GCMCA (or to the SPCMCA if the wing commander or
            equivalent authority does not exercise special court-martial convening authority).
            (See Figure 8.3)
            8.15.2.1.4.2. The GCMCA indorses the resignation to the officer’s MAJCOM of
            assignment.
            8.15.2.1.4.3. The MAJCOM/CC (or MAJCOM/CV if delegated) of assignment
            indorses the resignation and forwards it to AFLOA/JAJM, with an information
            copy of the officer’s RILO submission to HQ AFPC/DPSOS.
            8.15.2.1.4.4. The wing commander or any superior commander may return to an
            officer a resignation that is conditioned on the character of discharge SecAF may
            direct or that is conditioned on a specific date of separation.
            8.15.2.1.4.5. Documents submitted by the defense after the original submission
            of the resignation package will be considered at the discretion of the
            recommendation and decision authorities.
         8.15.2.1.5. A comprehensive legal review from the base level (or equivalent) legal
         office where the RILO originated, including the view of each victim of the alleged
         offense(s) (see paragraphs 7.3 and 7.12.12.6).
     8.15.2.2. Defense Counsel. Before officers resign for the good of the service, they are
     given an opportunity to meet with counsel or they are provided with military counsel
     unless they expressly decline one.
132                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


         8.15.2.2.1. If officers refuse counseling by military counsel, they should state this in
         their resignation memorandums.
         8.15.2.2.2. The Air Force will not reimburse officers for civilian counsel.
      8.15.2.3. Written legal reviews are not required at intermediate levels of command
      between the originating legal office and AFLOA/JAJM, unless an intermediate level legal
      office disagrees with a lower level legal review or needs to add and discuss omitted
      matters. Otherwise, written coordination indicating concurrence is all that is required.
      MAJCOMs may require additional legal reviews if they desire.
      8.15.2.4. Do not delay processing court-martial charges through referral solely because a
      RILO is pending.
      8.15.2.5. AFLOA/JAJM forwards the resignation to SecAF.
      8.15.2.6. HQ AFPC/DPSOS schedules the officer’s date of separation as soon as
      possible upon receiving notification from AFLOA/JAJM that the RILO has been
      approved.
  8.15.3. Requests to Proceed to Trial Pending Action on Officer Resignation. Prior
  authorization from AFLOA/JAJM is required before proceeding to trial in all officer cases in
  which action on a RILO is pending. For purposes of this paragraph, the start of trial is
  defined as the acceptance of pleas at arraignment. In the request to proceed, include
  justification why the trial should proceed before a decision on the resignation. If permission
  to proceed is granted, do not, under any circumstances, prepare a convening authority action
  before SecAF issues a decision on the resignation. A Request to Proceed is not required to
  conduct pre-arraignment preliminary sessions pursuant to Article 39(a)(1), (2) and (4),
  UCMJ, including conducting evidentiary hearings and other motions which may help
  expeditiously process the case in the interests of judicial economy.
  8.15.4. Seven Day Rule for RILOs. Do not proceed to trial in any officer case with a RILO
  pending without prior authorization from AFLOA/JAJM. AFLOA/JAJM will normally
  approve requests to proceed to trial while a RILO is pending, if the RILO is submitted more
  than seven calendar days after service of charges on the accused under RCM 602. In those
  cases, the only justification necessary in the request to proceed to trial is the untimely
  submission of the RILO, but additional reasons may be submitted if they exist. If a RILO is
  submitted within seven days of service of charges under RCM 602, requests to proceed to
  trial pending action on the RILO will normally be disapproved by AFLOA/JAJM absent
  compelling circumstances warranting trial while the RILO is pending. RILO processing
  should not be stopped or delayed, nor should the RILO be rejected for processing, based
  solely upon the time submitted unless submitted post-arraignment. All timely RILOs must
  be forwarded through functional and command channels for Secretarial action, even if
  submitted more than seven days after service of charges under RCM 602.
  8.15.5. Subsequent Resignations. The wing commander or any superior commander may
  return to an officer a subsequent resignation that is based on the same grounds or supported
  by the same evidence as a previous resignation. EXCEPTIONS: First, an officer whose
  resignation has been declined prior to referral of charges, may resubmit that resignation after
  charges are referred to trial. Process a resubmitted resignation as expeditiously as possible to
  the level that denied the original resignation. Do not attach additional indorsements or
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                     133


  recommendations unless required by changed circumstances. Continue processing an
  officer’s resignation as prescribed in paragraph 8.15.1. Second, process other subsequent
  resignations if the Show Cause Authority (as defined in AFI 36-3206) determines that
  unusual circumstances warrant.
  8.15.6. Withdrawing Resignations. Base legal offices forward relevant materials to the
  officer’s MAJCOM of assignment through the GCMCA. Base legal offices also ask the
  command or headquarters to hold a pending resignation when the officer files a withdrawal
  request.
     8.15.6.1. Base legal offices will include the following:
         8.15.6.1.1. Request to withdraw resignation.
         8.15.6.1.2. Wing commander’s (or equivalent authority) indorsement.
         8.15.6.1.3. Copy of resignation with indorsements and attachments.
     8.15.6.2. The GCMCA indorses the withdrawal request and forwards it to the officer’s
     MAJCOM of assignment.
     8.15.6.3. The MAJCOM/CC (or MAJCOM/CV if delegated) indorses the withdrawal
     request and forwards it to AFLOA/JAJM for action with an information copy to HQ
     AFPC/DPSOS.
  8.15.7. If base legal offices receive a request for a retirement in lieu of court-martial
  proceedings, for the good of the service, contact AFLOA/JAJM for further guidance.
  8.15.8. RILO Processing Time Management. Expeditious processing of RILOs is essential
  to preventing unnecessary trial delay, uncertain trial preparation, wasted resources,
  distraction to the mission, disrupted schedules of victims and witnesses, and prolonged
  uncertainty and anxiety for the accused. The following Air Force measures are established
  for RILO processing.
     8.15.8.1. Process RILOs within 60 days on average from the date the accused first
     submits a RILO to the date the accused is notified of a final decision on the RILO. This
     timeline is further delineated as follows:
         8.15.8.1.1. Base level (or equivalent) legal offices should process and forward the
         original RILO package (including documents required pursuant to paragraph 8.15.1)
         to AFLOA/JAJM, and electronically post such documentation for review by
         intermediate levels of command, no later than 10 days after the accused first submits
         the RILO;
         8.15.8.1.2. NAF (or equivalent) legal offices should process and electronically post
         the GCMCA indorsement and any required legal review no later than 7 days after the
         base level legal office submits the RILO package;
         8.15.8.1.3. MAJCOM legal offices should process and forward the MAJCOM
         indorsement and any required legal review to AFLOA/JAJM, and electronically post
         such documentation, no later than 7 days after the NAF legal office submits the
         GCMCA indorsement;
 134                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


          8.15.8.1.4. AFLOA/JAJM and AFLOA/JAJ should process and forward the original
          RILO package, along with all required documentation, to AF/JA no later than 7 days
          after receipt of the completed package with all required indorsements and legal
          reviews;
          8.15.8.1.5. AF/JA should process and forward the original RILO package, along with
          all required documentation no later than 5 days after receipt of the package from
          AFLOA/JAJ;
       8.15.8.2. Failure to meet this measure at any stage of RILO processing shall not confer
       any rights or benefits on the accused.
       8.15.8.3. Withdrawal and dismissal of charges. If a RILO is pending and the convening
       authority withdraws and dismisses all charges, the RILO will be returned to the applicant
       without further processing and will not require a decision by SecAF on acceptance or
       denial of the RILO. The base legal office is responsible for returning the RILO to the
       applicant. If charges are later repreferred, and the officer would like to submit a RILO,
       the process will begin anew.

Section 8G—Matters Requiring Air Force Legal Operations Agency Assistance

8.16. Appeals by the United States from an Adverse Ruling by a Military Judge (RCM
908).
   8.16.1. Trial counsel may file a notice of appeal by the United States under Article 62,
   UCMJ, and RCM 908 only after consultation with the Government Trial and Appellate
   Counsel Division (AFLOA/JAJG). The SJA decides whether to file such notice of appeal
   with the convening authority’s concurrence.
   8.16.2. After filing a notice of appeal conforming to the requirements of RCM 908(b) with
   the military judge, trial counsel sends notice to AFLOA/JAJG within 20 days, requesting that
   office file the appeal with the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA). In the request,
   identify the ruling or order to be appealed and include the following:
       8.16.2.1. A copy of the charges and specifications;
       8.16.2.2. An original and two copies of the verbatim record of the applicable
       proceedings, or, if not available, a summary of the evidence and facts;
       8.16.2.3. Trial counsel’s certification that the appeal is not taken to delay the case;
       8.16.2.4. Trial counsel’s certification that, if the order or ruling excludes evidence, the
       excluded evidence is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding; and
       8.16.2.5. A memorandum opinion on the law applicable to the issues appealed, including
       an explanation why the issues appealed are significant enough to require appeal by the
       United States.
   8.16.3. AFLOA/JAJG decides whether to file the appeal with AFCCA, and notifies the trial
   counsel, SJA and AFLOA/JAJM.
8.17. Extraordinary Writs by Government Counsel. A petition for extraordinary relief by the
prosecution in a court-martial is, and should remain, a rare course of action.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         135


8.18. Classified or Controlled Information. Special procedures and requirements apply in
cases where classified information may be used as evidence. In all such cases, contact
AFLOA/JAJM as soon as possible for guidance on how to proceed.
   8.18.1. Declassification. At the earliest stage practicable, government counsel should
   coordinate with the original classification authority to request declassification of potential
   evidence.
   8.18.2. Asserting the MRE 505 Privilege. Only SecAF, or the head of a government agency
   for documents owned by agencies outside the Air Force, may claim the privilege from
   disclosure of classified information (MRE 505). A person who may claim the privilege may
   authorize a witness or trial counsel to claim the privilege on his or her behalf. Forward
   requests for assertion of the privilege through command channels to AFLOA/JAJM.
   8.18.3. Classified Material in the Record. When a ROT contains classified material,
   declassify the material when proper. If it is impossible to declassify the material, the record
   must be classified. In determining whether a particular ROT must be classified because of its
   content, consideration should be given to DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security Program, and
   AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. See AFMAN 51-203, Chapter 6,
   for additional guidance.
   8.18.4. Controlled Material in the Record. When a ROT contains controlled material (e.g.,
   promotion testing materials, PME test materials, CDC EOC Exams, etc.), safeguard the
   materials to prevent further disclosure or unauthorized access. See AFMAN 51-203, Chapter
   6, for additional guidance.
8.19. Disclosure of Government Information other than Classified Information (MRE
506). Immediately notify AFLOA/JAJM if a case involves assertion of the privilege against
disclosure of government information.
   8.19.1. Asserting the MRE 506 Privilege. Only SecAF, or the head of a government agency
   for documents owned by agencies outside the Air Force, may claim the privilege from
   disclosure of government information other than classified information. The privilege for
   records and information of the Inspector General may be claimed by the immediate superior
   of the inspector general officer responsible for creation of the records or information, the
   Inspector General, or any other superior authority (MRE 506). A person who may claim the
   privilege may authorize a witness or trial counsel to claim the privilege on his or her behalf.
   Forward requests for assertion of the privilege through command channels and the Air Force
   Safety Center Staff Judge Advocate (AFSC/JA), to AFLOA/JAJM.

Section 8H—Trial by Military Judge

8.20. Requesting Trial by Military Judge. To request a trial by military judge alone, the
accused should use the DD Form 1722, Request for Trial Before Military Judge Alone. If the
DD Form 1722 is used, it must be included in the ROT as an appellate exhibit. AFMAN51-203,
Records of Trial, Figure 4.1. Refer to RCM 903 for additional guidance.

Section 8I—Use of Audiovisual and Teleconferencing Technology
 136                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


8.21. Audiovisual and Teleconferencing Technology. The use of audiovisual and
teleconferencing technology is authorized by SecAF to the extent and under the conditions
allowed for in RCM 804(b), 805(a), 805(c), and 914B.

Section 8J—Findings and Sentencing Worksheets

8.22. Use of Findings and Sentencing Worksheets. The following forms may be used to assist
court members put court-martial findings and sentences in the format required by the Manual for
Court-Martial:
     8.22.1. AF Form 1092, Court-Martial Findings Worksheet.
        8.22.1.1. Where a specification against a service member alleges wrongful acts on
        “divers occasions,” trial counsel should request members be instructed that any findings
        made by exceptions and substitutions that remove the “divers occasions” language should
        clearly reflect the specific instance of conduct upon which the modified findings are
        based. Such changes can generally be accomplished through reference in the substituted
        language to a relevant date or other facts in evidence that will clearly put the accused and
        the reviewing court on notice of what conduct served as the basis for the finding. United
        States v. Walters, 58 MJ 391 (CAAF 2003).

                            OFFER FOR PRETRIAL AGREEMENT

I, (grade, name, SSN) , am presently the accused under court-martial charges, dated
_______________ (and__________ ). I have read the charge(s) and specification(s) alleged
against me, and they have been explained to me by my defense counsel, (rank, if military, and
name). I understand the charge(s) and specification(s), and I am aware I have a legal and moral
right to plead not guilty and to leave the prosecution with the burden of proving my guilt beyond
a reasonable doubt by legal and competent evidence. Understanding the above and under the
conditions set forth below, and in consideration of agreement by the convening authority to
approve a sentence in accord with the limitations set forth in Appendix A, (I offer to waive my
right to a trial by members and I will elect to be tried by military judge alone) (and to) (withdraw
Charge ______________, Specification _______) (modify Specification ______________ of
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             137


Charge ___________ to the lesser offense of ___________) (refer the case to a special court-
martial), I offer to plead Guilty

To all Charges and Specifications
               or
To the Charge and Specification(s)
               or
To the following Charge(s) and Specification(s): (set forth by number or in full the charge(s)
and specification(s) to which the guilty plea will apply. If the plea is to be a lesser included
offense as to one or more specifications, set forth the exceptions and substitutions correctly and
in full. MCM, Appendix 10.

I understand that this offer, when accepted by the convening authority, constitutes a binding
agreement. I assert that I am, in fact, guilty of the offense(s) to which I am offering to plead
guilty, and I understand that this agreement permits the government to avoid presentation in
court of sufficient evidence to prove my guilt. I offer to plead guilty because it will be in my
best interest that the convening authority grants me the relief set forth above and in Appendix A.
I understand that I waive my right to a trial of the facts and to be confronted by the witnesses
against me, and my right to avoid self-incrimination insofar as a plea of guilty will incriminate
me.

In making this offer, I state that:

1. I am satisfied with the defense counsel who advised me with respect to this offer and consider
(him) (her) (them) competent to represent me in this court-martial.

2. No person or persons made any attempt to force or coerce me into making this offer or to
plead guilty.

3. My counsel fully advised me of the nature of the charges against me, the possibility of my
defending against them, any defense which might apply, and the effect of the guilty plea which I
am offering to make, and I fully understand (his) (her) advice and the meaning, effect, and
consequences of this plea.

4. I understand the signature of the convening authority to this offer and to Appendix A, or to
any modified version of Appendix A which I also sign, will transform this offer into an
agreement binding upon me and the Government.

5. I understand that I may withdraw my plea of guilty at any time before sentence but not after
sentence is announced and that, if I do so, this agreement is canceled and of no effect. This
agreement will also be canceled and of no effect, if any of the following occurs:

a. Refusal of the court to accept my plea of guilty, as set forth above, or modification of the plea
by anyone during the trial to not guilty or to a lesser degree of guilt.

b. Withdrawal by either party to the agreement before the trial.

c. My failure to agree with the trial counsel on stipulations concerning facts and circumstances.

(d. My failure to request or the court’s refusal to grant my request to be tried by military judge
alone.)

6. I understand the convening authority’s obligation to approve a sentence no greater than that
provided in Appendix A to this agreement may be canceled after a hearing following the
guidelines in RCM 1109, if I commit any offense chargeable under the UCMJ between the
announcement of sentence and the convening authority’s approval of any sentence (or fail to
provide restitution to ___________ in the amount of _________ by __________) (fail to return
__________ to ___________ by ___________) (fail to refrain from _____________ between the
announcement of sentence and the convening authority’s approval of any sentence)
(________________________). (See note 1.)

7. I understand that if this agreement is canceled for any reason stated above, this offer for an
agreement cannot be used against me in any way or at any time to establish my guilt of the
offense(s), and the limitations upon disposition of my case set forth in Appendix A will have no
effect.

   This document and Appendix A include all of the terms of this pretrial agreement, and no
other inducements have been made by the convening authority or any other person which affect
my offer to plead guilty.

NOTES:

1. The clauses contained in paragraph 6 of this figure are optional. If used, carefully tailor them
to include adequate protections against arbitrary revocation of the agreement to prevent their
being declared void as against public policy. See United States v. Dawson, 10 M.J. 142 (C.M.A.
1982); United States v. Connell, 13 M.J. 156 (C.M.A. 1982); MCM, Appendix 21, Analysis,
RCM 705(c)(2)(D).
2. The convening authority signs approving and accepting the Offer for Pretrial Agreement only
if approving it and Appendix A.
3. Overall sentence caps may be confusing. If the parties wish to cap the sentence in the
aggregate (allowing substitution of punishments for those specifically adjudged, so long as the
aggregate effect does not exceed the aggregate adjudged), the pretrial agreement should be
specific on this point. Otherwise, to avoid confusion, consider using the following language
when limiting more than one form of the punishment: “He will approve no punitive discharge, if
one is adjudged, more severe than a Bad Conduct Discharge; he will approve no confinement, if
confinement is adjudged, in excess of [state time in months or years]; he will approve no
forfeiture with a monthly amount in excess of $500 per month, nor a number of months in excess
of 36 months. There are no restrictions on his ability to approve other forms of punishment that
may be adjudged.”
4. See paragraph 8.7.1.
5. The convening authority signs Appendix A only if approving it and the Offer for Pretrial
Agreement.

SUBJECT: Resignation for the Good of the Service under AFI 51-201

       I am resigning for the good of the service under AFI 51-201 effective as soon as possible.
 142                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


        I am resigning voluntarily for the good of the service because [my conduct renders me
subject to trial by court-martial.] [I am serving under a suspended sentence to dismissal (if the
sentence includes any other punishment, set out all of its elements).] I am resigning in my own
best interest. Nobody threatened me, coerced me, or made promises to induce me to resign.

         I understand that if the Secretary of the Air Force accepts my resignation, I will receive a
discharge under other than honorable conditions unless the Secretary of the Air Force determines
that I should receive a discharge under honorable conditions (general) or an honorable discharge.
I understand I may lose all rights and benefits under laws administered by the Department of
Veterans’ Affairs, regardless of the character of discharge I receive. I understand that if I receive
a discharge under other than honorable conditions, I will not receive settlement for accrued
leave.

        (Use if the officer resigns awaiting trial by court-martial:) [I understand that my case may
go to trial while Secretarial action is pending and that I may not withdraw my resignation
without approval of the Secretary of the Air Force or his or her designee.]

        [I am not accountable or responsible for public property or funds.] [I am accountable or
responsible for public property or funds. I have attached the required certificate of relief.]
(NOTE: If accountable or responsible for public property or funds, attach a certificate indicating
that they’ve been relieved from accountability or responsibility. Specify whether they’ve
returned all issued government property to the proper agency.)

        [I [have] [have not] consulted with counsel regarding this action.] [I decline counsel but
(grade, full name, and full duty title of the Chief, Force Support Squadron) counseled me and I
fully understand my rights and options regarding this action.] [I fully understand my rights and
options regarding this action, as explained to me by (enter area defense counsel’s grade and full
name, if military, or full name and business address, if civilian, or both).]

Figure 8.4. Recoupment Statement for Resignation for the Good of the Service.
        I understand that if I am separated per my request before completing the period of active
duty I agreed to serve, I may be subject to recoupment of a portion of education assistance,
special pay, or bonus money received.

        I understand the recoupment in all cases will be an amount that bears the same ratio to the
total amount or cost provided to me as the unserved portion of active duty bears to the total
period of active duty I agreed to serve.

        I understand education assistance includes such programs as service academy, armed
forces health profession scholarship program, Uniformed Services University of the Health
Sciences, ROTC college scholarship program, tuition assistance, Air Force Institute of
Technology, and minuteman education program.

        I understand that if I dispute the indebtedness for educational assistance, the show cause
authority will appoint an officer (or a civilian employee) to conduct an inquiry into the facts and
hear evidence presented by me and other parties as appropriate, to determine the validity of the
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                       145


debt. The show cause authority will forward the report of inquiry, together with his/her
recommendation concerning recoupment, with the case to the Secretary of the Air Force for
decision.

                                            Chapter 9

                                  POST-TRIAL PROCEDURE

Section 9A—Report of the Result of Trial (RCM 1101; RCM 1305).

9.1. Purpose. The Report of Result of Trial is the primary source of findings and sentence
information.
9.2. Publication of Result of Trial. The Report of Result of Trial memorandum will be
automated and printed from AMJAMS. After final adjournment of the court-martial in every
case, the trial counsel will promptly sign and publish the result of trial using the Report of Result
of Trial memorandum. (See Figure 9.16.). Distribute the Result of Trial memorandum to the
accused’s immediate commander, the GCM and SPCM convening authorities and their SJAs, the
commander of the local SFS and AFOSI detachment, and, if the accused is in confinement, to the
commanding officer responsible for the confinement facility and the confinement officer.
Additional copies may be distributed as directed by the convening authority.
   9.2.1. Format. The Report of Result of Trial memorandum will be dated the date that it is
   published. If corrections are necessary, issue a CORRECTED COPY and use the new date
   published. Pleas and findings should be entered for both the Charges and the Specifications.
   See paragraph 10.10 for corrected copy guidance. Make corrections the same as a court-
   martial order (CMO). See paragraph 10.10.1.
   9.2.2. Expurgated and Unexpurgated. For cases involving sex offenses, regardless of
   outcome, prepare two copies and replace names of victims in the expurgated copy with
   initials. The expurgated copy is then distributed. Both copies are included in the original
   record of trial. In cases involving child victims 16 years and under, prepare and distribute an
   expurgated copy only. Expurgate other information as appropriate using the guidance under
   paragraph 10.7.
   9.2.3. Content. The Report of Result of Trial memorandum must accurately reflect findings
   of guilty to lesser included offenses and pleas or findings with exceptions and/or
   substitutions. To ensure accuracy, make sure your AMJAMS inputs are correct and timely.
   The sentence portion of the Report of Result of Trial memorandum shall include both the
   sentence as announced as well as the PTA sentence limitation. Ensure specifications which
   have pleas and findings with exceptions and/or substitutions are entered verbatim, not simply
   summarized. Indicate “Sex Offender Notification Required,” “DNA Processing Required,”
   and/or “Crime of Domestic Violence” as applicable. See paragraphs 13.18, 13.20.4, and
   13.22 for more information.

Section 9B—Post-Trial Confinement

9.3. Entry into Post-Trial Confinement. Sentences to confinement run from the date
adjudged, except when suspended or deferred by the convening authority. Use the DD Form
2707, Confinement Order, to enter an accused into post-trial confinement.
   9.3.1. Processing DD Form 2707.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           147


       9.3.1.1. When a court-martial sentence includes confinement, the legal office should
       prepare the top portion of the DD Form 2707. The person directing confinement,
       typically the trial counsel, signs item 7(a). The Staff Judge Advocate signs item 8(d) as
       the officer conducting a legal review and approval. The same person cannot sign both
       item 7(a) and 8(d). Before signing the legal review, the judge advocate should ensure the
       form is properly completed and the individual directing confinement actually has
       authority to direct confinement.
       9.3.1.2. Unless limited by a commander in the accused’s chain of command the authority
       to order post-trial confinement is delegated to the trial counsel or assistant trial counsel.
       See RCM 1101(b).
       9.3.1.3. Security Forces personnel receipt for the prisoner by completing and signing
       item 11 of the DD Form 2707. The servicing legal office must retain a signed copy of the
       DD Form 2707. Security Forces personnel must ensure the prisoner receives a medical
       examination within 24 hours or the next duty day after entry into confinement as required
       by AFI 31-205, paragraph 5.3.2. Security Forces personnel ensure medical personnel
       complete items 9 and 10 of the DD Form 2707. Ensure a completed copy of DD Form
       2707 is returned to the legal office for insertion in the ROT. Security Forces retains the
       original DD Form 2707 for inclusion in the prisoner’s Correctional Treatment File (CTF).
   9.3.2. If an accused is in pretrial confinement, no action is normally necessary to continue
   that confinement. The Report of Result of Trial memorandum may serve in lieu of the DD
   Form 2707. See AFI 31-205, paragraph 5.1.
9.4. Effect of Pretrial Confinement. An accused receives day-for-day credit for any pretrial
confinement served in military, civilian or foreign confinement facilities, for which the accused
has not received credit against any other sentence. United States v. Allen, 17 M.J. 126 (C.M.A.
1984), United States v. Murray, 43 M.J. 507 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 1995) and United States v.
Pinson, 54 M.J. 692 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2001). An accused may also be awarded pretrial
confinement credit for restriction tantamount to confinement, having previously been punished
for the same offense with nonjudicial punishment, violations of RCM 305, violations of Article
12, UCMJ, and/or Article 13, UCMJ.
   9.4.1. When a military judge directs credit for illegal pretrial confinement (violations of
   Article 12, Article 13, and/or RCM 305), this credit must be ordered in the convening
   authority’s initial action (RCM 1107(f)(4)(F)). See Figure 9.11.
   9.4.2. Any credit for pretrial confinement should be clearly reflected on the Report of Result
   of Trial memorandum and DD Form 2707, along with the source of each portion of credit
   and total days of credit awarded (e.g., “310 days of confinement credit based upon 10 days of
   credit for restriction tantamount to confinement, 100 days of credit for military pretrial
   confinement, and 200 days of administrative credit for illegal pretrial confinement.”).
9.5. Confinement Facility (RCM 1101; 1107(f)(4)(C); 1113(d)(2)(C)). HQ AFSFC/SFC
oversees Air Force correctional facilities worldwide, is responsible for inmates gained by HQ
AFSFC/SFC (inmates not ordered to serve sentences in local correctional facilities), and
approves all inmate transfers between military corrections facilities. HQ AFSFC/SFC, not the
convening authority, selects the corrections facility for post-trial confinement and rehabilitation
 148                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


for inmates gained by HQ AFSFC/SFC.            Refer to AFI 31-205 for confinement rules and
practices.
   9.5.1. Correctional facilities other than those in the Air Force Corrections System may be
   used to confine inmates. HQ AFSFC/SFC sends detailed instructions covering selection of
   inmates for these assignments, details of transfer, and other administrative matters. The
   GCMCA over an inmate transferred to such a facility exercises the same responsibilities as
   those assigned in this chapter to the Commander, Air Force District of Washington (AFDW)
   for inmates in the Air Force Corrections System.

Section 9C—Preparing, Serving, and Forwarding Records of Trial

9.6. Preparing Records of Trial. Prepare court-martial records of trial (ROT) in accordance
with RCM 1103, RCM 1305, MCM Appendices 13-15, and AFMAN 51-203, Records of Trial.
Ensure ROTs are authenticated in accordance with RCM 1104(a). See also AFMAN 51-203,
chapter 12 and paragraph 10.3.
9.7. Serving Records of Trial. Serve the ROT on the accused in accordance with RCM
1104(b) or RCM 1305(d). Include the proof of service, or substitute service, in the ROT. (It is
good practice to notify the defense counsel of record when service of the ROT on the accused is
completed.)
   9.7.1. Victims of a crime punishable under Article 120, UCMJ, who testified during the
   proceedings of a special or general court-martial are entitled to a copy of the record of
   proceedings without charge as soon as the records are authenticated.
       9.7.1.1. In a case with a conviction, in accordance with RCM 1103(b)(2)(B-D), provide
       victims with the record of proceedings to include: a copy of the record of trial; a copy of
       the charge sheet; a copy of the convening order and any amending orders; a copy of the
       request, if any, for trial by military judge alone, or that the membership of the court shall
       include enlisted persons; a copy of the exhibits which were received in evidence; and,
       when made available, a copy of the dated, signed, action by the convening authority.
       Since the convening authority’s action is normally prepared after authentication, offer to
       delay providing the record to the victim until after the convening authority’s action is
       signed. If the victim agrees, obtain written confirmation of the victim’s decision. If the
       victim instead elects to receive the authenticated record of trial as soon as it is available,
       the convening authority’s signed action shall be served on the victim as soon as it is
       available. Note: Ensure records sealed in accordance with RCM 1103A are not
       provided to the victim. Also ensure all records provided to the victim are redacted in
       accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act.
       9.7.1.2. In a case with an acquittal, in accordance with RCM 1103(e) and AFMAN 51-
       203, furnish the victim with the same record provided to the accused: a copy of the
       convening order (an any amending orders); sufficient information to establish jurisdiction
       over the accused and the offense, and abbreviated ROT. Note: Ensure all records
       provided to the victim are redacted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act
       and the Privacy Act.
9.8. Forwarding Records of Trial. Forward the ROT to the convening authority or his or her
SJA, in accordance with RCM 1104(e). After the convening authority takes action, promptly
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          149


forward the original ROT and required copies to AFLOA/JAJM for appellate review, or the
GCM/SJA for review under Article 64a, UCMJ, using the most cost-effective method which
provides a means to track the ROT. Do not forward incomplete ROTs (e.g., ROTs that are
missing documents or have unsigned receipts). Incomplete ROTs will not be considered
transferred in AMJAMS. Consult AFMAN 51-203, Chapters 3 and 13, for the number of
required copies that must accompany the original and for forwarding instructions.

Section 9D—Matters Submitted by Victims

9.9. Post-Trial Submission of Victim Impact Statements. Immediately following trial, or as
soon thereafter as practicable, the trial counsel or designee generates a letter to each victim, if
any, of the accused’s result of trial. The trial counsel or designee should personally serve this
letter on the victim(s), or his or her Special Victims’ Counsel if applicable, at the same time as
the DD Form 2704, Victim/Witness Certification and Election Concerning Prisoner Status. The
SJA of the wing where the court-martial occurred signs the letter. This letter invites the
victim(s) to provide input, in the form of a written victim impact statement, to the convening
authority’s SJA, as to whether or not the convening authority should approve the findings and
sentence or grant some form of clemency. The letter provides that the victim has 10 calendar
days to submit a statement and states the time and date by which their statement must be
received in order to be considered. It also advises that any statements will be provided to the
accused and defense as part of the post-trial process and that the defense will have an opportunity
to comment on it as a part of their post-trial submission to the convening authority. See Figure
9.2. Like the accused, a victim can request a one-time extension.
   9.9.1. Eligible victims may consult with a legal assistance attorney or Special Victims’
   Counsel about the results of the court-martial and the post-trial process IAW AFI 51-504,
   Legal Assistance, Notary, and Preventive Law Programs. The trial counsel or designee may
   explain the post-trial process to victims IAW DD Form 2703, Post-Trial Information for
   Victims and Witnesses of Crime.
   9.9.2. SJAs should generally not delay processing post-trial matters as a result of these
   statements. For example, they should not delay providing the SJAR and post-trial paperwork
   to the accused and defense counsel in order to try to locate a victim who is not readily
   available or who chooses to provide a statement after the time and date set forth in the letter
   from the SJA to the victim. This applies to victims of all crimes to include, but not limited
   to, sexual assault, larceny, etc.
9.10. Service of Victim Impact Statements. Serve the victim impact statements, if any, on the
accused and defense counsel at the same time as the ROT. Generally, the victim impact
statements should be provided as attachments to the SJAR. If an SJA decides to accept a victim
impact statement that is received after the SJAR and ROT have been served on the accused and
defense counsel, the SJA shall serve the victim impact statement on the accused and defense
counsel at that time, re-starting the 10 days provided for the accused to respond.

Section 9E—Matters Submitted by the Accused and/or Defense Counsel (RCM 1105)

9.11. Notice Regarding Post-Trial Submissions. The SJA, trial counsel, or assistant trial
counsel provides the accused and defense counsel a memorandum (Figure 9.3) informing the
accused of the right to submit matters, including clemency matters, for the convening authority’s
 150                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


consideration, and the time period for making such submissions. Address the letter to the
accused and provide a copy to the defense counsel responsible for post-trial matters. If an SJA
recommendation is not required in the case, provide the letter to the detailed military defense
counsel, unless the accused requested otherwise. Include a copy of the notification letter, with
the accused’s receipt, in the ROT as specified in AFMAN 51-203, paragraph 4.6 and Figure 4.1.
   9.11.1. Waiver of Accused’s Right to Submit Matters. If the accused submits a waiver of
   the right to submit matters, include the written waiver in the ROT. See Figures 9.4 and 9.5.
9.12. Applications to Defer Sentence and Waive Required Forfeitures. Before action is
taken on a case, an accused may submit an application to the convening authority, through the
servicing SJA, to defer any adjudged and/or mandatory forfeiture of pay or allowances, reduction
in grade, or service of a sentence to confinement. See Articles 57(a)(2), 57a(a), and 58b(a)(1). If
an accused has dependents, an application may also be submitted to the convening authority,
through the servicing SJA, to waive any mandatory forfeiture of pay and allowances under
Article 58b(b), for the benefit of the accused’s dependents. Applications for deferral and/or
waiver may be submitted through the servicing SJA any time after the sentence is announced and
before action by the convening authority. See Section 9G for additional guidance on deferring
and waiving forfeitures of pay and allowances.
9.13. RCM 1105 Submissions. An accused may submit matters, including clemency
recommendations, for the convening authority to consider before taking action on the case.
Failure to submit matters within the time prescribed shall be deemed a waiver of the right to
submit such matters. Submission of any matters shall be deemed a waiver of the right to submit
additional matters unless the right to submit additional matters within the prescribed time limits
is expressly reserved in writing. An accused may also waive, in writing, the right to submit
matters; once submitted, such waiver may not be revoked. See RCM 1105(d). See RCM 1105
for further discussion on matters that may be submitted, waivers, and the appropriate time
periods for submissions.
9.14. Requests for Entry in Return to Duty Program (RTDP). The RTDP offers selected
enlisted personnel with exceptional potential the opportunity to return to active duty and have
their punitive discharge, if adjudged, remitted. Participants are provided with programs
individually designed to address their confining offenses and improve their conduct, attitude, and
productivity for continued Air Force service. The accused’s defense counsel assists the accused
in volunteering for the RTDP by obtaining and submitting the appropriate paperwork to the
convening authority. An eligible inmate who volunteered, but was not approved by the
convening authority for entry into the RTDP, may be eligible to apply for entry to the Air Force
Clemency and Parole Board. See AFI 31-205, paragraph 11.6, for additional guidance on
applications and requirements for entry in the RTDP.

Section 9F—Staff Judge Advocate Recommendation and Addendum (RCM 1106)

9.15. Mandatory Recommendation. A Staff Judge Advocate’s Recommendation (SJAR) is
required in cases where the convening authority takes action on a ROT by GCM or a ROT by
special court-martial that includes a sentence to a bad conduct discharge or confinement for one
year.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                       151


   9.15.1. An SJAR is not required when the convening authority takes action on a ROT in a
   SCM or SPCM that does not include either a sentence to a bad conduct discharge or
   confinement for one year. In these cases, the SJA must provide the convening authority with
   the ROT, the defense submission, an acknowledgement to be signed by the convening
   authority that he or she considered the defense submissions, and a proposed action for the
   convening authority’s signature. When an SJAR is not required, the action may be
   forwarded using the sample action memorandum provided in Figure 9.6, to ensure all of the
   matters the Convening Authority is required to consider are listed. If this action
   memorandum is not used there must be some evidence that the convening authority
   acknowledged all the matters he or she is required to consider. Practitioners must be careful
   not to raise new matters in the action memorandum, otherwise it must be served on the
   accused. If there is a need to address a new matter, be sure to serve new matters on the
   accused and accused’s counsel and allow 10 days from service to submit comments. See
   RCM 1106(f)(7).
9.16. SJAR Contents. An SJAR should be a clear and concise recommendation written in
memorandum format containing the information required by RCM 1106(d). Attach copies of the
Report of Result of Trial memorandum, and the personal data sheet of the accused admitted at
trial (see Figure 3.7.) to the SJAR. See sample format at Figure 9.7.
   9.16.1. When combined with the SJAR and the Report of Result of Trial memorandum, the
   personal data sheet ensures that required information concerning the accused’s service record
   is provided to the convening authority.
   9.16.2. Include the original SJAR with all attachments (the Report of Result of Trial
   memorandum and the personal data sheet) in the original ROT. The attachments must follow
   immediately behind the SJAR in the ROT, even if these documents are also included in other
   parts of the record. Place a copy of the SJAR and attachments in each copy of the ROT.
   9.16.3. The SJAR must include items required by RCM 1106 that are not included on the
   personal data sheet or the Report of Result of Trial memorandum. This includes a
   description of the character of the accused's service prior to the charges (RCM
   1106(d)(3)(C)), any clemency recommendations made by the sentencing authority (made in
   conjunction with the announced sentence) (RCM 1106(d)(3)(B)), and any additional credit
   awarded by the military judge for illegal pretrial confinement. The SJAR should also contain
   the victim impact statement (if any), the maximum sentence for the guilty
   specifications/charges and a copy or summary of the terms and conditions of any pretrial
   agreement, including a statement of any action the convening authority is obligated to take
   under the agreement or a statement of the reasons why the convening authority is not
   obligated to take specific action under the agreement.
   9.16.4. When an allegation of legal error is raised in matters submitted under RCM 1105 or
   when otherwise deemed appropriate by the SJA, the SJAR will state the staff judge
   advocate’s opinion as to whether corrective action on the findings or sentence should be
   taken.
   9.16.5. The SJAR should address any previously approved request from the accused for
   deferral of confinement, forfeitures of pay, and/or reduction in grade, and any previously
   approved or pending request from the accused or the accused’s dependents for a waiver of
   mandatory forfeitures under Article 58b, UCMJ. Approved deferrals and waivers must be
 152                                                                  AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   documented in the convening authority’s action and the convening authority must act upon
   pending requests.
       9.16.5.1. If a convening authority previously disapproved a request for deferral or waiver
       prior to initial action on the sentence, comment in the SJAR on that request and what
       action may still be appropriate. For example, a convening authority may disapprove a
       deferral or waiver request based upon matters adverse to the accused from outside the
       record. If the convening authority also considers such matters when taking action on the
       sentence, the accused is entitled to notice and an opportunity to rebut. See RCM
       1107(b)(3)(B)(iii). Notice may be satisfied through the SJAR.
9.17. Preparing and Signing the SJAR. The SJAR must clearly indicate that the
recommendation is from the SJA. An assistant performing the duties of the SJA may sign as
“Acting as the Staff Judge Advocate.” An assistant SJA may prepare the recommendation, but
the SJA (or if unavailable, the person “Acting as the Staff Judge Advocate”) must review the
ROT and sign the SJAR. No person who participated in the court-martial as a member, a
military judge, a trial counsel, a defense counsel or investigating officer may draft or sign the
SJAR or addendum or otherwise act as the SJA or legal advisor to any reviewing or convening
authority in that case. See RCM 1106(b).
   9.17.1. If the convening authority does not have an SJA (or the person “Acting as the Staff
   Judge Advocate”) or the person serving in that capacity is disqualified under RCM 1106(b)
   or otherwise, then the convening authority must request the assignment of another SJA to
   prepare the SJAR or forward the record to any GCMCA as provided in RCM 1107(a). See
   RCM 1106(c)(1).
       9.17.1.1. If all judge advocates on the SPCMCA’s staff are disqualified from preparing
       and signing the SJAR, forward the record to the GCMCA’s SJA. That officer may
       prepare and sign the SJAR or designate another SJA (or the person “Acting as the Staff
       Judge Advocate”) in the GCMCA’s command to prepare and sign the SJAR.
       9.17.1.2. If all judge advocates on the GCMCA’s staff are disqualified from preparing
       and signing the SJAR, forward the record to the MAJCOM’s SJA. That officer may
       prepare and sign the SJAR or designate another SJA (or the person “Acting as the Staff
       Judge Advocate”) in the MAJCOM to prepare and sign the SJAR. If all the SJAs (or the
       person “Acting as the Staff Judge Advocate”) in the MAJCOM are disqualified from
       preparing and signing the SJAR, the MAJCOM SJA requests AFLOA/JAJM’s assistance
       in designating an SJA to prepare and sign the SJAR.
   9.17.2. If the original SJA did not sign the SJAR, the SJA signing the SJAR must include an
   explanation in the allied papers of the ROT. An explanation is not required if it is clear from
   the ROT (e.g., forwarding memorandum, transfer memorandum) why the original SJA did
   not sign the SJAR.
9.18. Service of SJAR on Defense. Ensure copies of the SJAR, including its attachments, are
served on the accused’s counsel and, unless impracticable, on the accused. Obtain receipts for
service of the SJAR from both and include them in the ROT. If service on the accused is
impracticable or if the accused so requests on the record at the court-martial or in writing,
forward the accused’s copy to the accused’s defense counsel and attach a statement to the ROT
explaining why the accused was not served. See RCM 1106(f)(1).
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                       153


9.19. Defense Counsel Response to SJAR. The accused’s counsel may submit objections or
rebuttal to any matter in the SJAR and may comment on any other matter. Defense counsel must
submit comments within 10 days of service of the ROT on the accused (under RCM 1104(b)) or
receipt of the SJAR, whichever is later, unless the period is extended. See RCM 1106(f)(4) and
(5). If a victim impact statement is accepted by an SJA during the accused’s 10 days, the
accused’s 10 day clock will restart on the day that victim impact statement is accepted.
9.20. Addendum to the SJAR. When the SJA receives matters submitted by an accused or
defense counsel under RCM 1105 or 1106(f)(4) after service of the SJAR on defense, the SJA
must prepare an addendum to the SJAR for the convening authority. The SJA must address
whether corrective action is required when an allegation of error is raised in matters submitted
under RCM 1105. The response may consist of a statement of agreement or disagreement with
the matter raised by the accused or counsel. RCM 1106(d)(4). The SJA may address other
matters raised by defense submissions in the addendum. Figure 9.8 is a sample addendum to the
SJAR when defense matters are submitted. If matters are not submitted, the SJA should still
prepare an addendum to the SJAR. See paragraph 9.20.3.
   9.20.1. The Addendum to the SJAR must:
       9.20.1.1. List each defense submission as a separate attachment to the addendum;
       9.20.1.2. Advise the convening authority that per RCM 1107(b)(3)(A) he or she must
       consider the result of trial, the recommendation of the SJA and all written matters
       submitted by the defense. RCM 1107(b)(3)(A)(iii); and
       9.20.1.3. Advise the convening authority that he or she may consider other matters prior
       to taking action, such as the ROT, personnel records of the accused, and such other
       matters as the convening authority deems appropriate. However, if the convening
       authority considers matters adverse to the accused from outside the record, the accused
       must be notified and given an opportunity to rebut. See RCM 1107(b)(3)(B). This
       includes any victim impact statements submitted.
   9.20.2. New Matters in Addendum. New matters include all references to issues that are not
   included in the ROT and are not served on defense counsel and the accused with the SJAR.
   New matters ordinarily do not include the SJA’s discussion of the correctness of the defense
   counsel’s comments on the recommendation. If the addendum includes new matters, serve
   the accused and defense counsel with the addendum containing the new matter. They are
   allowed 10 days from service to submit comments. RCM 1106(f)(7).
       9.20.2.1. When an addendum containing new matters is served upon the accused and
       defense counsel for comment, a second or additional addendum must be prepared to
       address defense comments or the absence of such comments. The second or additional
       addendum must list any additional defense submissions as an attachment, must re-advise
       the convening authority to comply with paragraphs 9.20.1.2 and 9.20.1.3, and may
       address any matters raised in additional defense submissions. If any addendum contains
       new matters, comply with paragraph 9.20.2.
   9.20.3. If the SJA does not receive matters from the accused or defense counsel per RCM
   1105 after service of the SJAR on defense per RCM 1106, the SJA must still prepare an
   addendum to the SJAR for the convening authority. In this case, the matters addressed in
   paragraphs 9.20.1.1 and 9.20.1.2 are not required, nor would paragraph 9.20.2 apply unless
 154                                                                  AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   new matters are addressed in the Addendum to the SJAR. Figure 9.9 is a sample addendum
   to the SJAR when defense matters are not submitted.
9.21. Staff Summary Sheets. Avoid use of a staff summary sheet (SSS) in conjunction with the
SJAR, addendum to the SJAR, and action memorandum. If a SSS or other document is used to
forward the record (e.g., SJAR, action memorandum, RCM 1105 or RCM 1106 matters from the
defense, Addendum to the SJAR, ROT) to the convening authority for action, it must be included
with the ROT. The contents of any SSS should not ordinarily include any information not
previously addressed in the SJAR or addendum to the SJAR. Such information in the SSS may
constitute new matter. Any document that the SJA uses to supplement the post-trial
recommendation must be served on the defense counsel when it contains new matter. United
States v. Thompson, 43 M.J. 703 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 1995). If the SSS adds new matter not
otherwise addressed in the SJAR or addendum to the SJAR, it must be served on the accused and
defense counsel for comment. United States v. Leslie, 16 M.J. 714 (A.F.C.M.R. 1983).

Section 9G—Initial Action by the Convening Authority (RCM 1107)

9.22. When Initial Action May Be Taken. The convening authority may not take initial action
until the time period for the accused to submit matters for consideration under RCM 1105(c) has
expired or the accused has waived the right to submit such matters under RCM 1105(d).
   9.22.1. Action While RILO is Pending. The convening authority must not, under any
   circumstances, take action under RCM 1107 on any officer case in which an accused’s
   resignation for the good of the service (RILO) is pending final SecAF decision (see
   paragraph 8.16.2).
   9.22.2. Acquittals. There is no convening authority action for an acquittal of all charges and
   specifications. A promulgating order is required. See paragraph 10.8.1.1.
   9.22.3. Provide a copy of the dated, signed, action by the convening authority in accordance
   with paragraph 7.11.9. and paragraph 9.7.1.1.
9.23. Convening Authority Discretion. The convening authority is not required to take any
action on the findings, to review the case for legal errors, or to review the case for factual
sufficiency. Action taken on the findings and sentence is a matter of command prerogative and
within the sole discretion of the convening authority.
   9.23.1. Convening authorities should consider an accused’s service in an area of combat
   operations in determining what punishment, if any, to approve. Where the sentence of an
   accused with an outstanding record in an area of combat operations extends to a punitive
   discharge, convening authorities should consider suspending or remitting the discharge,
   provided that return to duty is in the best interests of the Air Force.
   9.23.2. Convening authorities may not substitute an administrative discharge for an adjudged
   punitive discharge. However, in cases involving relatively minor offenses, an accused with
   an outstanding combat record, or other exceptional circumstances, and where restoration to
   duty is inappropriate, convening and reviewing authorities may consider recommending to
   SecAF, administrative, rather than punitive, separation under Article 74(b), UCMJ. Contact
   AFLOA/JAJR, 1500 West Perimeter Road, Ste 1170, Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility
   Washington, MD 20762, for assistance and coordination on such recommendations.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         155


9.24. Disqualification of Convening Authority. A convening authority may not conduct the
post-trial review of a case if the attendant facts and circumstances would lead a reasonable
person to impute to him/her a personal interest in the outcome of the case or a personal bias
towards the accused. United States v. Gudmundson, 57 M.J. 493 (C.A.A.F. 2002); United States
v. Voorhees, 50 M.J. 494 (C.A.A.F. 1999); United States v. Crossley, 10 M.J. 376 (C.M.A.
1981); United States v. Gordon, 1 C.M.A. 255, 2 C.M.R. 161 (C.M.A. 1952).
   9.24.1. If the SPCMCA is unable to take action in a case, forward the case to the GCMCA
   through the GCMCA’s SJA. If the GCMCA is unable to take action, the MAJCOM
   commander designates a convening authority to do so.
   9.24.2. The ROT allied papers must include a memorandum by the SJA (of the convening
   authority taking action) explaining why a different convening authority took action on the
   case or place a copy of G-series order behind the Action. The memorandum is not required if
   it is clear from the ROT (e.g., forwarding memorandum, transfer memorandum) why a
   different convening authority took action on the case.
   9.24.3. Transfer of responsibility for recommendation and action does not transfer authority
   to order or rescind deferments of sentence under Article 57a. That authority remains with the
   convening authority granting the deferment or, if the accused is no longer under that
   command, then with the GCMCA for the command to which the accused is currently
   assigned.
9.25. Format for Initial Actions. Prepare convening authority’s initial action in accordance
with RCM 1107(f) and the guidance in the MCM, Appendix 16. Samples of a convening
authority’s initial action are at Figure 9.10. If a convening authority or reviewing authority
withdraws an action and substitutes a new one, refer to paragraph 10.10.2 and Figure 10.8 for the
proper format.
   9.25.1. Findings. Findings are addressed in the action only when any findings of guilty are
   disapproved, in whole or part. See sample formats in MCM, Appendix 16.
   9.25.2. Deferred Forfeitures and Reduction in Grade and Waiver of Automatic Forfeitures.
   See Section 9H for guidance, and Figures 9.11 and 9.12 for sample formats for initial actions.
9.26. Additional Considerations When Preparing Initial Actions.
   9.26.1. Limitation on Forfeitures (RCM 1003). If no confinement is adjudged and a
   forfeiture exceeding two-thirds pay per month is adjudged, reduce the approved forfeiture to
   not more than two-thirds pay per month to run for a specified period of time or up until the
   punitive discharge is executed. Where an accused sentenced to an adjudged period of
   confinement and a forfeiture exceeding two-thirds pay per month has served the adjudged
   period of confinement prior to the convening authority’s action, reduce the approved
   forfeiture to not more than total forfeitures for the period the accused was in confinement and
   not more than two-thirds pay per month thereafter, to run either for a specified period of time
   or up until execution of an adjudged punitive discharge. See RCM 1107(d)(2), Discussion;
   United States v. Craze, 56 M.J. 777 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2002); United States v. York, 53
   M.J. 553 (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2000); and United States v. Warner, 25 M.J. 64 (C.M.A.
   1987). Forfeitures of pay per month must be stated in whole dollars (RCM 1003).
 156                                                                  AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   9.26.2. Duration of Forfeitures. When total forfeitures are approved, the duration of
   forfeitures is not specified. An enlisted member, sentenced to a punitive discharge,
   confinement and total forfeitures, restored to duty after release from confinement is entitled
   to pay and allowances from the date the member is restored to duty, and the forfeitures
   become inoperative thereafter. DoD 7000.14-R, Department of Defense Financial
   Management Regulation, Vol. 7A, paragraph 480804.
   9.26.3. Application of Article 58a, UCMJ. The provisions of Article 58a do not apply to the
   Air Force. All reductions in grade will be based upon adjudged and approved sentences.
   9.26.4. Suspension of Sentences and Proceedings to Vacate a Suspended Sentence. RCM
   1108 and RCM 1109. In a case where the convening authority suspends all or part of the
   execution of a sentence, include a copy of the suspension terms and the member’s receipt in
   each copy of the ROT with the suspension action. If a suspended sentence is later vacated,
   document the vacation hearing on a DD Form 455, Report of Proceedings to Vacate
   Suspension of a General Court-Martial Sentence or of a Special Court-Martial Sentence
   Including a Bad-Conduct Discharge Under Article 72, UCMJ, and R.C.M. 1109. If the
   member waives the vacation hearing, the DD Form 455 is not required. Send the completed
   DD Form 455 or the member’s waiver to AFLOA/JAJM for review and filing with the
   original ROT. Distribute court-martial orders announcing the vacation of a suspended
   sentence as required in Chapter 10. Use special orders to announce SCM sentence vacations.

Section 9H—Articles 57(a) and 58b, UCMJ

9.27. Distinctions between Articles 57(a) and 58b, UCMJ. Articles 57(a) and 58b are
separate and distinct statutory provisions. They serve different purposes.
   9.27.1. Article 57(a) mandates the effective date of any forfeiture of pay and allowances or
   reduction in grade that is included in the sentence of a court-martial. It provides that
   adjudged forfeitures and an adjudged reduction in grade will take effect upon the convening
   authority’s action or 14 days after the sentence is adjudged, whichever occurs first. There is
   no additional requirement under Article 57(a) for the sentence to include confinement or a
   punitive discharge. Therefore, adjudged forfeitures and reductions, unless deferred, should
   take effect on the date provided for in Article 57(a) even if there is no confinement or
   punitive discharge in the case.
   9.27.2. Article 58b requires forfeiture of pay (and allowances in GCMs) due a member
   during qualified periods of confinement or parole. The mandatory forfeitures (also known as
   required or automatic forfeitures) under this provision only take effect if three conditions
   exist:
       9.27.2.1. The adjudged sentence includes confinement for more than six months or
       death, or confinement for any period and a dishonorable discharge, bad conduct
       discharge, or dismissal;
       9.27.2.2. The accused is in confinement or on parole; and
       9.27.2.3. The accused is otherwise entitled to pay and allowances that are subject to
       mandatory forfeitures.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         157


   9.27.3. As with adjudged forfeitures, mandatory forfeitures take effect the date of action or
   14 days after the sentence is adjudged, whichever is sooner. The amount of pay and
   allowances forfeited in a GCM is all pay and allowances otherwise due the accused. The
   amount of pay forfeited in a SPCM is two-thirds of pay otherwise due the accused. In these
   cases, make sure FF are announced in whole dollar amounts. Allowances otherwise due are
   not subject to mandatory forfeitures in SPCM.
9.28. Deferral and Waiver Provisions under Articles 57(a) and 58b: Articles 57(a) and 58b
contain provisions that enable a convening authority to permit payments to the accused and/or
the accused’s dependents that would otherwise have been forfeited.
   9.28.1. Article 57(a)(2) permits the convening authority to defer either adjudged forfeitures
   or an adjudged reduction in grade, or both, from taking effect until action. The accused must
   submit a written request to have adjudged and, if applicable, mandatory forfeitures deferred.
   The accused’s pay will not stop if the convening authority approves a deferment of both
   adjudged and mandatory forfeitures, or approves a deferment of only adjudged forfeitures
   when there are no mandatory forfeitures. The convening authority may rescind a deferment
   at any time. Deferred forfeitures are paid to the accused.
   9.28.2. Mandatory forfeitures can only be waived in cases where an accused has dependents.
   Waived forfeitures must be paid to the dependents. See paragraph 9.30 for dependency
   determinations.
   9.28.3. Mandatory forfeitures can only be waived by the convening authority for a period not
   exceeding six months, or the period of confinement if less than six months.
   9.28.4. Waived forfeitures cannot be applied beyond the member’s expiration of term of
   service (ETS) because the pay entitlement ceases at that point.
   9.28.5. The accused does not have to apply for a waiver of mandatory forfeitures. The
   convening authority may waive mandatory forfeitures on his or her initiative.
   9.28.6. The convening authority can waive mandatory forfeitures either before taking action
   or when taking action on the case. The waiver can be retroactive, designated to begin on a
   date 14 days after the sentence is adjudged.
   9.28.7. The convening authority must defer, suspend, mitigate or disapprove all or part of
   adjudged total forfeitures in order to waive any amount of mandatory forfeitures. Mandatory
   forfeitures can be waived for the benefit of the accused’s dependents only to the extent
   adjudged forfeitures are not in effect. See United States v. Emminizer, 56 M.J. 441 (C.A.A.F.
   2002).
   9.28.8. A convening authority can defer mandatory forfeitures (and any adjudged
   forfeitures) until action and then waive mandatory forfeitures for a period not to exceed six
   months. A combination of deferral and waiver can maximize the pay and allowances going
   to the accused and his or her family.
9.29. Mechanics of Deferring and Waiving Forfeitures: Figure 9.1 explains the relationship
between adjudged and mandatory forfeitures from the date sentence is adjudged until the end of
the forfeiture period. To assist in drafting the convening authority’s action on the sentence, see
Figures 9.11 and 9.12.
158                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


  9.29.1. Accused’s Deferral Request. If an accused requests a deferral of a reduction in grade
  and/or a forfeiture of pay (and allowances) until action is taken, the convening authority may
  approve the request, in full or in part, or may disapprove the request.
      9.29.1.1. The accused’s deferral request should specify whether a request for deferred
      forfeitures is for adjudged forfeitures, mandatory forfeitures, or both. If it is unclear, the
      convening authority may treat it as a request for deferral of both.
      9.29.1.2. The convening authority’s action on the request should be reflected in a signed
      and dated document.
      9.29.1.3. The terms of approved deferrals must also be reported in a 14-day
      memorandum in accordance with Figure 9.13 and must be reported in the action the
      convening authority ultimately takes on the case.
      9.29.1.4. A deferral of forfeitures may be for adjudged forfeitures, mandatory forfeitures,
      or both, and for all pay and allowances to which the accused is entitled or a lesser sum.
  9.29.2. Waiver of Mandatory Forfeitures. In cases where mandatory forfeitures are waived,
  whether prior to or as part of the action, the approved waiver should express the amount
  approved in dollar amounts per month. The exception to this is when the waiver is for total
  pay and allowances in a GCM. If two-thirds pay are approved in a SPCM, these must be
  reflected in whole dollar amounts.
      9.29.2.1. Approved requests must identify the dependents that will receive the waived
      forfeitures. If payments are made to an ex-spouse or other person on behalf of minor
      dependents, confirmation that the designated payee is the appointed guardian or custodian
      of a minor dependent is required. Legal offices should provide information described in
      AFMAN 65-116V1, Defense Joint Military Pay System Active Component (DJMS-AC)
      FSO Procedures, paragraph 67.5.5, to the local finance office when processing waiver
      requests. This information includes a copy of the waiver request (if submitted), copy of
      the approved waiver request with amount approved, full name of payees, proof of
      dependency of payees or certification that the payees are dependents of the member,
      payment account information, and a statement signed by payee and member agreeing to
      notify legal and finance if the payee ceases being a dependent during the period payments
      are made.
      9.29.2.2. If mandatory forfeitures are waived before action, the convening authority must
      reflect approval in a signed and dated document. Such a waiver of mandatory forfeitures
      must also be reported in the 14-day memorandum and in the convening authority’s action
      on the case.
      9.29.2.3. Contact the local accounting and finance office to determine the accused’s
      entitlements and the actual amount of pay and allowances the accused and/or the
      accused’s dependents may be entitled to receive. A number of factors can impact these
      entitlements:
         9.29.2.3.1. Basic Allowance for Subsistence (BAS). In most cases, the accused will
         lose BAS upon entering confinement. Therefore, the convening authority cannot give
         the accused’s family any portion of the accused’s BAS.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          159


          9.29.2.3.2. Taxes. Federal and state taxes will be withheld from any payments of
          deferred or waived forfeitures. Therefore, if the convening authority wants the
          accused’s family to receive a certain amount of money, the amount of taxes should be
          factored into the calculation.
          9.29.2.3.3. Grade Reduction. A reduction in grade may significantly lower the
          amount of the accused’s pay that is eligible for waiver. Therefore, if the convening
          authority wants the accused’s family to receive a certain amount of money, the effect
          of a reduction in grade should be taken into consideration.
          9.29.2.3.4. Spouse on Active Duty. A spouse who is also an active duty military
          member can receive only waived forfeiture of pay, not pay and allowances.
          9.29.2.3.5. Expiration of Term of Service (ETS). There are no forfeitures to waive
          on any date after the accused’s ETS. Any PTA to approve a waiver of any amount of
          forfeitures when the accused is near or beyond his or her ETS may render pleas
          improvident because the accused may not receive the benefit of his bargain. PTAs
          containing a waiver provision must clearly state that any waiver is only applicable to
          pay and/or allowances that the accused is otherwise entitled to receive. See United
          States v. Perron, 58 M.J. 78 (C.A.A.F. 2003) and paragraph 8.4.4.
9.30. Dependency Determinations under Article 58b: When addressing waivers of
mandatory forfeitures under Article 58b, UCMJ, an issue may arise as to whether a person
qualifies as a dependent.
   9.30.1. Dependent Categories. RCM 1101(d)(3) provides that, for the purpose of waiving
   forfeitures, a “dependent” means any person qualifying as a dependent according to 37
   U.S.C. § 401. This statute identifies four categories of dependents:
      9.30.1.1. Spouse of the accused, regardless of military status.
      9.30.1.2. Unmarried child of the accused under 21 years of age, including an adopted
      child or stepchild. In addition, special rules permit a child as old as 23 years of age to be
      a dependent if enrolled as a full-time student and a child older than 21 years of age to be
      a dependent if incapable of self-support due to mental or physical incapacity. However,
      in these two cases the accused must provide more than one-half of the child’s support.
      9.30.1.3. Parent of the accused. Additional dependency requirements are required,
      including the accused providing over one-half of the parent’s support. Parents includes
      natural parents, stepparents, and adoptive parents of the accused or the accused’s spouse;
      and any other person who stood in loco parentis to the accused for a continuous 5 year
      period before the member became 21 years of age.
      9.30.1.4. Unmarried persons placed in legal custody of the member as a result of a court
      order for a period of at least 12 months. This category of persons, known as wards, must
      depend upon the accused for over one-half of their support and must meet numerous
      other criteria set forth in the statute (37 U.S.C. § 401).
   9.30.2. Evidence of Dependency. Sufficient evidence of dependency is required to support
   an Article 58b waiver. The nature of this evidence will depend on the status of the
   dependent.
 160                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


       9.30.2.1. Dependency status for a spouse and/or child may be established by their
       enrollment in DEERS or by other competent evidence, such as a marriage certificate for a
       spouse or a birth certificate or court order establishing paternity and/or child support
       obligations for a child.
       9.30.2.2. Dependency determinations for a child over 21 years of age, parents, or a ward
       are more complex because they only qualify as a dependent if the military sponsor
       provides more than one-half of their support. A thorough determination by DFAS is
       necessary. A precondition for waiving forfeitures for the benefit of one of these
       dependents should be an “approval letter” of dependency from DFAS. The accused, or
       other party requesting the waiver, should provide a copy of the DFAS “approval letter”
       with any request to waive mandatory forfeitures.
       9.30.2.3. If an accused was unable to qualify the person(s) as dependent(s) with DFAS,
       there will normally be insufficient evidence of dependency to support an Article 58b
       waiver of mandatory forfeitures.
9.31. Service of Legal Reviews on the Accused: The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals has
addressed whether an SJA’s legal advice to a convening authority regarding requests for deferral
or waiver of forfeitures must be served upon the accused with an opportunity to respond.
Deferrals need not be served, see paragraph 9.31.1. Waivers must be served, see paragraph
9.31.2. In either case, legal offices should process requests promptly.
   9.31.1. Article 57(a) Deferral of Forfeiture Requests. In United States v. Key, 55 M.J. 537
   (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 2001), the Court held that an SJA review of a request for deferral of
   forfeitures does not need to be served on the defense for comment prior to submission to the
   convening authority. The Court compared such a request to a request for deferral of a
   sentence to confinement, for which no SJA recommendation is required and, historically, the
   SJA’s legal analysis of the request is not served on the accused. Any SJA review and action
   by the convening authority on the request must become a part of the completed ROT.
   9.31.2. Article 58b Waiver of Forfeiture Requests. In United States v. Spears, 48 M.J. 768
   (A.F. Ct. Crim. App. 1998), the Court considered whether a legal review of a request for a
   waiver of forfeitures must be served on the defense prior to submission to the convening
   authority. The Court noted that SJAs are not required to prepare legal reviews of requests for
   waiver of automatic forfeitures. The Court treated the request for waiver of forfeitures as a
   clemency request and declared that practitioners must exercise care when addressing the
   request for waiver of forfeitures before the record is completed. Spears set this basic
   approach: any legal review prepared by the SJA for the convening authority prior to
   completion of the SJAR should be attached to the SJAR and become part of the completed
   ROT. Any legal review that may be prepared after the SJAR should be treated as an
   addendum to the SJAR and served on the accused for comment when it contains matter
   outside the record. Serve it on the accused before submission to the convening authority and
   include it in the completed ROT.
9.32. Application of Article 57(a) and 58b To Cases With Offenses Committed Prior to 1
April 1996. For cases in which all of the charged offenses occurred before 1 April 1996, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, in United States v. Gorski, 47 M.J. 370 (C.A.A.F.
1997), held these provisions operate in violation of the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                        161


   9.32.1. For cases affected by the Gorski decision, any forfeitures collected pursuant to
   Article 58b (mandatory forfeitures); Article 57(a)(1)(A) (adjudged forfeitures taken prior to
   convening authority action); and/or any pay and allowances withheld due to a reduction in
   grade pursuant to Article 57(a)(1)(A) (reduction in grade prior to convening authority
   action), are without legal effect and will be restored.
   9.32.2. For cases involving offense(s) committed both before and after 1 April 1996, the
   Court, in United States v. Carter, 49 M.J. 392 (C.A.A.F. 1998), applied unitary sentencing
   principles and limited the Gorski holding to those cases where the maximum sentence for any
   or all offenses committed on or after 1 April 1996 would induce mandatory forfeitures under
   Article 58b.

Section 9I—Contingent Confinement

9.33. Contingent Confinement. Contingent confinement is confinement authorized by a court-
martial in the form of a fine-enforcement provision. See RCM 1003(b)(3) and RCM 1113(d)(3).
A fine enforcement provision may be ordered executed in accordance with the procedures below.
   9.33.1. Authority to Execute Contingent Confinement. A fine does not become effective
   until ordered executed (Article 57(c), UCMJ). Fines may be ordered executed in the
   convening authority’s initial action (Article 71(c)(2), UCMJ). The accused is not required to
   pay a fine until the fine is ordered executed. Moreover, an accused may not be ordered to
   serve contingent confinement until the fine is ordered executed and the requirements of
   paragraph 9.34 are met. If the accused fails to demonstrate that he or she has made good
   faith efforts to pay the fine but cannot because of indigency, the convening authority may
   order the sentence of confinement executed by following the procedures outlined in
   paragraph 9.34.
   9.33.2. Enforcement. Once court-martial jurisdiction attaches, an accused remains subject to
   the UCMJ through the execution and enforcement of a sentence. Article 2(a)(1), UCMJ,
   confers jurisdiction over members of a regular component of the armed forces, including
   those awaiting discharge after the expiration of terms of enlistment. Jurisdiction continues
   for the purpose of enforcing an adjudged sentence for individuals discharged as the result of
   a court-martial conviction. Carter v. McClaughry, 183 U.S. 365 (1902); Peebles v. Froehlke,
   46 C.M.R. 266 (C.M.A. 1973).
9.34. Procedures for Executing Contingent Confinement. Contingent confinement may be
executed in accordance with the following procedures:
   9.34.1. When the fine is ordered executed, the accused must be notified in writing the fine is
   due and payable. A specific due date should be included in the notification. If the accused is
   in confinement, the due date should normally be a reasonable period before the accused is
   scheduled for release from confinement to allow adequate time for a contingent confinement
   hearing and convening authority action.
   9.34.2. After the fine is considered due, the SJA for the base where the accused was tried
   ascertains whether the accused has met his or her obligations concerning the fine. If it
   appears the fine has not been paid, notify the convening authority. If the convening authority
   finds probable cause to believe a fine is unpaid, the convening authority may order a
   contingent confinement hearing. The convening authority for this hearing is the officer who
162                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


  convened the court-martial, his or her successor in command, or the officer exercising
  GCMCA over the command to which the accused is assigned. If the accused is no longer a
  member of the Air Force, the Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) Commander
  (GCMCA over the Air Force Corrections System) is the convening authority. The purpose
  of the hearing is to determine whether the fine is delinquent, whether the delinquency, if any,
  resulted from the accused’s indigence and whether the contingent confinement should be
  executed.
  9.34.3. A military judge is detailed as hearing officer to conduct the contingent confinement
  hearing in the same manner as detailed to a court-martial.
  9.34.4. The accused is provided written notice of the time and place of the hearing. The
  convening authority provides the accused with temporary duty orders or invitational travel
  orders if the accused is not in confinement and the hearing is beyond reasonable commuting
  distance from the accused’s residence. See Figure 6.8 for appropriate funding authority. The
  notice informs the accused of the following:
      9.34.4.1. The accused’s alleged failure to pay the fine;
      9.34.4.2. The purpose of the hearing to determine whether the fine is delinquent and
      whether the delinquency, if any, is the result of the accused’s indigence;
      9.34.4.3. The accused’s right to present witnesses and documentary evidence;
      9.34.4.4. The accused’s right to representation by military defense counsel; and
      9.34.4.5. The evidence which was relied upon in issuing the notice of hearing and the
      options available to the convening authority.
  9.34.5. Unless the hearing is otherwise waived, the hearing officer makes findings on
  whether payment of a fine is delinquent and whether any delinquency resulted from the
  accused’s indigence. Payment of a fine is delinquent if not made within the period specified
  in the approved sentence or, if no period is specified, within a reasonable time. An accused’s
  failure to pay a fine is not due to indigence if the failure to pay the fine resulted from a
  willful refusal to pay the fine or a failure to make sufficient good faith efforts to pay it. The
  Government bears the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, of showing that
  payment of the fine is delinquent. The accused bears the burden of proof, by a
  preponderance of the evidence, of showing that any delinquency resulted from indigence.
  9.34.6. Hearing Procedures.
      9.34.6.1. The hearing officer determines the facts from the best evidence available.
      Rulings on evidentiary and procedural matters are final. Strict evidentiary rules do not
      apply and hearsay statements are admissible.
      9.34.6.2. The accused may testify and present witnesses and documentary evidence.
      Witness testimony may be presented through sworn or unsworn statements, affidavits,
      depositions, prior testimony, stipulations of expected testimony, or telephone conference.
      The accused may not compel the production of a witness at Government expense unless
      the request is made to the hearing officer, in writing, before the hearing and the hearing
      officer determines:
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          163


          9.34.6.2.1. The physical presence of the witness is critical to a fair determination of a
          material issue in dispute;
          9.34.6.2.2. The witness is available to testify; and
          9.34.6.2.3. There is no substitute for the live testimony of the prospective witness
          (e.g. written statements, affidavits, stipulations, or telephone conference).
      9.34.6.3. The accused has a right to confront and cross-examine those witnesses
      testifying at the hearing.
      9.34.6.4. The accused may be represented at the hearing by a civilian attorney or civilian
      representative of the accused’s choice at no cost to the Government. The accused is also
      entitled to representation by either an ADC or military counsel of the accused’s selection,
      if reasonably available (see paragraph 5.4). The accused is not entitled to representation
      by more than one military counsel.
      9.34.6.5. A court reporter reports the hearing and prepares a summarized record of the
      proceeding. The record includes a summary of the evidence presented and any objections
      or requests considered by the hearing officer.
      9.34.6.6. The hearing officer submits a written report to the convening authority through
      the SJA, including a statement of the evidence relied upon to support the findings. If the
      hearing officer chooses to make the findings and statement of evidence on the record,
      transcribe them verbatim. The hearing officer forwards the report and/or record to the
      convening authority.
      9.34.6.7. The convening authority takes final action on the hearing officer’s findings and
      determinations. The convening authority may adopt, modify or reject the hearing
      officer’s findings and determinations. If the hearing officer’s findings and determinations
      are not adopted, the convening authority must specify the evidence relied upon and the
      reasons for the decision.
      9.34.6.8. If the convening authority determines payment of the fine is delinquent and the
      failure to pay is not due to indigence, the convening authority may order the sentence of
      confinement executed. See Figure 9.13 for a sample order executing contingent
      confinement. If the convening authority determines the accused has made good efforts to
      pay the fine, but cannot because of indigency, the convening authority may not order the
      sentence of confinement executed unless he or she determines that there is no other
      punishment adequate to meet the Government’s interest in appropriate punishment. See
      RCM 1113(d)(3).
      9.34.6.9. Forward a copy of the summarized record of the contingent confinement
      hearing for each copy of the ROT required by AFMAN 51-203, chapters 3 and 13 to
      AFLOA/JAJM.

Section 9J—Notifications of Adjudged Sentence, Action of the Convening Authority, and
Deferment or Waiver

9.35. Reporting by Base Level SJA. In all courts-martial with mandatory forfeitures under
Article 58b, UCMJ, adjudged forfeitures, or reduction in grade, the SJA of the office that
prosecuted the case must send a memorandum by the most expeditious means available to HQ
 164                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


AFPC/DPSOE (enlisted only) and the member’s finance office, with informational copies to HQ
AFSFC/SFC and DFAS-DE/FJPC in the format set out in Figure 9.12. The referenced
memorandum must be sent within 24 hours of the date the convening authority takes action
under RCM 1107 or 14 days after the sentence is adjudged, whichever is earlier. If any portion
of the punishment or mandatory forfeitures is deferred or if the convening authority waives any
portion of the mandatory forfeitures prior to the date of the message, the memorandum must
include the terms of such deferment or waiver. Notification can be made to DFAS at
afcourtmartials@dfas.mil; DPSOE at afpc.dpppwm@us.af.mil; and AFSFC at
hqafsfc.apellv@us.af.mil.
9.36. Reporting by Convening Authority’s SJA. If action is taken more than 14 days after the
sentence is adjudged, in any case where the approved sentence includes a reduction in grade or
forfeitures (mandatory or adjudged), the SJA of the convening authority must send a second
memorandum within 24 hours after the convening authority’s RCM 1107 action. If any portion
of the punishment or mandatory forfeiture is deferred or if the convening authority waives any
portion of the mandatory forfeiture, the second memorandum must include the terms of such
deferment or waiver. Send the message to the same addressees listed in paragraph 9.35 and, if
the accused is confined, to the confinement facility, using the format in Figure 9.14 For members
who enter a prisoner status requiring a permanent change of station, also send the memorandum
to the gaining AFO.
9.37. Notification and Distribution of Documents to Confinement Facilities.
   9.37.1. After action by the original convening authority, the AFDW Commander exercises
   GCMCA over inmates transferred to Level II Regional Corrections Facilities (RCFs) and
   long-term corrections facilities as defined in AFI 31-205, and over those Air Force members
   and former members paroled or placed on excess leave from such facilities.
   9.37.2. When an inmate (with or without a punitive separation) is transferred into the Air
   Force Corrections System, the servicing SJA sends:
       9.37.2.1. Four copies of the court-martial order to HQ AFSFC/SFC and two copies of the
       court-martial order to the corrections officer of the facility housing the offender;
       9.37.2.2. Two copies of any victim request to be notified of changes in the inmate’s
       status and of clemency hearings to both HQ AFSFC/SFC and the corrections officer;
       9.37.2.3. One copy of the SJAR to both HQ AFSFC/SFC and the corrections officer;
   9.37.3. If at the time the inmate is transferred to a corrections facility, the court-martial order
   has not been published, send one copy of the Report of Result of Trial and the convening
   authority’s action to HQ AFSFC/SFC (e-mail transmission in lieu of mailing is permissible)
   and two copies of each to the corrections officer.

Section 9K—Involuntary (Required) and Voluntary Excess Leave

9.38. Excess Leave.
   9.38.1. The convening authority will place an accused that had either no confinement
   adjudged or already completed the period of confinement on involuntary excess leave while
   awaiting appellate review of an unsuspended punitive separation (See Article 76a, UCMJ).
   After serving an approved sentence of confinement, members of the Air Reserve
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                        165


  Components may be removed from active duty status rather than being placed in excess leave
  and recalled as necessary to complete appellate review. Contact HQ AFRC/JA for guidance.
  9.38.2. Members with an adjudged sentence that includes a punitive discharge may volunteer
  to be placed on excess leave pending the convening authority’s action. If the convening
  authority approves the punitive separation, terminate the accused’s voluntary excess leave
  status. Return the accused to duty or place on involuntary excess leave.
  9.38.3. When an approved sentence includes unsuspended confinement, the confinement
  must be served, remitted, or deferred before placing an accused on either voluntary or
  involuntary excess leave.
  9.38.4. An accused with accrued leave when required to take excess leave may elect to either
  receive pay and allowances during the period of accrued leave and then continue on unpaid
  excess leave or receive payment for the accrued leave as of the day excess leave begins, and
  serve the entire period on unpaid excess leave.
  9.38.5. If the accused’s sentence to a punitive separation is set aside or disapproved upon
  appellate review, the accused is entitled to pay and allowances for the period of required
  excess leave, unless a rehearing or new trial is ordered and a punitive separation results from
  the rehearing. The amount of pay and allowances is reduced by the amount of income,
  unemployment compensation, and public assistance benefits received by the accused from
  any government agency during the period of excess leave.
  9.38.6. The convening authority may order the accused to begin involuntary excess leave
  upon completion of a sentence to confinement in the RCM 1107 action, upon completion of a
  sentence to confinement or at any time following approval of a sentence which includes a
  punitive discharge, subject to paragraph 9.38.3. Such involuntary excess leave may continue
  until the date the discharge is executed, unless terminated at any earlier date.
  9.38.7. When a convening authority directs excess leave for an accused serving in an
  overseas area, the convening authority directs reassignment to the Force Support Squadron at
  the base nearest the appellate leave address provided by the accused.
     9.38.7.1. An accused may go directly to his or her leave address without reporting into
     the gaining unit. The accused will determine whether to physically report into the
     gaining unit before departure.
     9.38.7.2. The losing commander, consistent with the accused’s election, will direct the
     accused to travel from the overseas location to either the appellate leave address or the
     gaining unit as soon as possible after completion of out-processing. After arrival, the
     accused will commence taking accrued leave, if so elected, and/or required excess leave.
     9.38.7.3. The accused will be considered assigned to the Force Support Squadron at the
     gaining base on the date the member physically reports to the unit or, in cases where the
     accused does not physically report to the gaining unit, the date determined by the local
     FSS’s Personnel Relocations Element based upon the accused’s departure date and travel
     time.
     9.38.7.4. Overseas members may provide a leave address in an OCONUS state or
     territory of the United States (e.g., Alaska, Hawaii, Guam) and HQ AFPC may assign the
     member to the Force Support Squadron nearest such leave address. Overseas Airmen in
 166                                                                  AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


       foreign countries must provide an appellate leave address in a state or territory of the
       United States and will be reassigned to a Force Support Squadron at the base nearest the
       leave address. Overseas members in foreign countries will be required to depart the
       foreign country.
   9.38.8. Procedures for Placing an Accused on Excess Leave. When the convening authority
   orders an accused to take excess leave, the convening authority sends the accused a letter
   (Figure 9.15), through command channels, directing the excess leave and informing the
   accused of entitlements, status, and responsibilities while on excess leave. If the convening
   authority directed the excess leave in the action (see Figure 9.10.), the convening authority’s
   SJA, or the person Acting as the Staff Judge Advocate, may sign and serve the letter on the
   accused. The SJA for the convening authority directing excess leave ensures a signed copy
   of this letter, with the accused’s receipt and any subsequent address changes, is sent to the
   servicing FSS. A copy of all excess leave letters must be sent to AFLOA/JAJM. In cases of
   an accused being reassigned from overseas, a copy of the letter must also be sent to the SJAs
   of the SPCMCA and GCMCA of the gaining unit, the gaining excess leave FSS/CC, and
   AFLOA/JAJA. See Figure 9.15.
       9.38.8.1. Action to place the accused on voluntary or involuntary excess leave must
       comply with JFTR, paragraph U7506, and AFIs 36-3003, Military Leave Program, 36-
       2110, Assignments, 36-2102, Base-Level Relocations Procedures and 31-205. Ensure
       AMJAMS is updated to reflect the accused’s appellate leave address.
   9.38.9. Travel of Personnel Awaiting Completion of Appellate Review (Excess) Leave. An
   accused involuntarily placed on excess leave while awaiting completion of appellate review
   of a court-martial sentence to a punitive discharge or dismissal from the service may be
   provided travel or transportation in kind, according to the JFTR, Volume I. Ensure a special
   travel order is published in “A” series if the court-martial convening authority directs
   involuntary appellate (excess) leave according to AFI 36-3003 and this instruction. If the
   accused’s court-martial sentence is disapproved or set aside, and the member is restored to
   duty, the member is authorized travel or transportation in kind, according to the JFTR
   Volume I. In such cases, publish an “A” Series Travel Order IAW the publishing directive.

NOTES:
1. Mandatory forfeitures (MF) only apply when the three conditions listed in paragraph 9.27.2.
exist.
2. If the accused applies for deferment, the convening authority (CA) may defer all or a portion
of the AF and/or MF 14 days after the date on which the sentence was adjudged until the
convening authority takes action. The accused should specify whether the deferment requested
is for AF, MF, or both (a request for deferment of forfeitures in general is considered a request
for both). If a deferment is approved, the accused will be paid a sum equal to the pay and
allowances to which he or she is entitled, minus any amounts forfeited (AF and/or MF not
deferred). The CA may rescind a deferment (AF and/or MF) at any time.
3. The CA may waive available MF with or without a request from the accused. The CA may
waive MF to the extent that the accused is entitled to pay and allowances (see Note 1 above).
4. MF may be waived until the earlier of: 1) a period not to exceed six months; 2) the accused’s
release from confinement; or 3) the last day the accused is otherwise entitled to pay and
allowances (see Note 1 above).
5. At action, the CA may waive all or a portion of the available MF (if previously waived,
waiver is memorialized in the action) for the benefit of the accused’s dependents. The CA may
disapprove, commute or suspend all or a portion of the AF to increase the amount of MF
available for the CA to waive. The CA may retroactively waive MF, starting 14 days after the
date on which the sentence was adjudged.

to (Sentence). The next step in the process is for the Convening Authority, (grade and name of
Convening Authority), to decide whether to approve all or any portion of the findings and
sentence. I am writing to let you know how you can provide input to (me) (the Convening
Authority’s Staff Judge Advocate (SJA)) for the Convening Authority’s consideration.
2. Now that (current grade and name of the accused) has been found guilty, (his/her) case will be

and sentence. Before the Convening Authority takes action, (I) (the Convening Authority’s SJA)
will, pursuant to Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM) 1106, submit a recommendation to (him/her),
with a copy to defense counsel. (I) (the Convening Authority’s SJA) will review the record of
trial and advise the Convening Authority on whether the court-martial was lawfully constituted
and had jurisdiction over the accused and each offense, whether any errors were committed
which materially prejudiced (his/her) substantial rights, whether there is enough evidence in the
record to support each finding of guilty, and whether the adjudged sentence is lawful. Per RCM
1107, the Convening Authority can approve the sentence as adjudged, approve a lesser sentence,
or disapprove the sentence entirely. The Convening Authority can also disapprove some or all of
the findings of guilt. However, (he/she) cannot take any action that makes the verdict or
sentence worse, i.e. (he/she) cannot add charges or more punishment.
3. You may submit a statement in writing to (me) (the Convening Authority’s SJA) for
consideration in advising the Convening Authority. The choice is entirely yours. This statement
could describe the impact (Current grade and name of the accused)’s crime had on your life.
You may also discuss whether you believe the Convening Authority should approve the findings
and sentence or grant some form of clemency. However, this statement should not reference any
crimes for which (Current grade and name of the accused) was not convicted of by the court-
martial in order to avoid any prejudice to (his/her) post-trial rights.
4. If you want to submit a statement, please provide it to me no later than (time/date) at the
following office or email address: (office address) (email address). Your signature is required
on any statement submitted. [I will then provide your letter to the Convening Authority’s SJA.]
If you submit a statement, we will provide it, along with all of the relevant trial related
documents, to (Current grade and name of the Accused) and (his/her) attorney. (Current grade
and name of the accused) and (his/her) attorney will then have an opportunity to provide our
office with anything they want the Convening Authority to consider when making (his/her)
decision on whether to approve the findings and sentence.
5. (If eligible)You may also consult with (a legal assistance attorney) or (Special Victims’
Counsel) on whether to submit a victim impact statement and the contents of such a statement

MEMORANDUM FOR (Grade and Name of Accused)

FROM: (JA Office)

SUBJECT: Submission of Matters to the Convening Authority – United States. v. (Grade and
Name of Accused)

1. Since you have been convicted and sentenced by court-martial, you have the right to submit
matters for consideration by the convening authority of your court-martial before the convening
authority takes action on your case. The matters you submit may include any matters that might
affect the convening authority’s decision to approve or disapprove any findings of guilt or any
part of the sentence in your case. These matters may include:

   a. Allegations of errors affecting the legality of the findings or sentence in your case.

   b. Portions or summaries of your ROT, or copies of evidence introduced at trial.

   c. Matters in mitigation that were not available for consideration at your trial.

    d. Clemency recommendations by any court member, the military judge, or any other
person.

     e. Any other matters you or your counsel believe the convening authority should be aware of
before taking action in your case, whether or not available or introduced into evidence at your
trial.
 170                                                                  AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   f. (If the accused is enlisted) Your desire for entry into the Return to Duty Program. See
AFI 31-205.

2. You should consult with your defense counsel to decide whether to submit such matters. The
convening authority will consider all matters you submit before taking action in your case.
Failure to submit matters within the time provided in paragraph 4 constitutes a waiver of your
right to do so.

3. If you decide not to submit matters for the convening authority’s consideration, you may
waive, in writing, the right to submit such matters. Such a waiver may expedite the post-trial
processing and review of your case, if that is what you desire. You should consult your defense
counsel before waiving your rights to submit matters. Once you make such a written waiver, it
may not be withdrawn or revoked. You may indicate any waiver of your rights to submit matters
on the indorsement to this letter or by submitting a separate written waiver.

4. [For a GCM or SPCM, insert:] You have 10 days to submit matters for consideration by the
convening authority from the date you receive a copy of the authenticated ROT or, if applicable,
the date both you and your defense counsel receive a copy of the recommendation of the staff
judge advocate, whichever is later. If you are unable to submit your matters within this period,
you may, for good reason, apply to the convening authority, through the convening authority’s
staff judge advocate for an extension of the period.

[For a SCM, insert the following as paragraph 4:] You have 7 days from the date your sentence
was announced to submit your matters for the convening authority’s consideration. Your matters
must be submitted by (date)(time). If you are unable to submit your matters within this period,
you may, for good cause, apply to the convening authority, through the convening authority’s
staff judge advocate, for an extension of the period.

5. In addition to the submissions described above, you may submit an application to the
convening authority, through the servicing SJA, to defer any forfeitures of pay or allowances,
reduction in grade, or service of a sentence to confinement. If you have dependents, you may
also submit an application to the convening authority, through the servicing SJA, to waive any
mandatory forfeitures of pay and allowances under Article 58b(b), UCMJ, with the amount
waived paid to your dependents. Applications for deferral and/or waiver may be submitted
immediately. In order for the convening authority to give such requests proper consideration,
they should normally be submitted no later than the time provided in paragraph 4 above.

SUBJECT: Waiver of Right to Submit Clemency Matters – United States v. (Grade and Name
of Accused)

1. I have been briefed by my defense counsel, (Name and Grade of Defense Counsel),
(Location), concerning my rights to submit matters to the convening authority, detailed in Article
60, UCMJ, (and) Rule for Court-Martial 1105 (and Article(s) 57a (and 58b), UCMJ), before
he/she takes action in my case. After considering my rights and the advice of my counsel, I
hereby elect that I will not submit any matters for the convening authority’s consideration. This
waiver is voluntary and no one has coerced me in any way or made any promises in regard to my
decision. I understand that this waiver is irrevocable once submitted.

2. I understand my rights and the time limitations to make submissions to the convening
authority. [For a GCM or SPCM insert:] I understand that I have 10 days from (the later of) my
receipt of a copy of the authenticated record of trial (or receipt of the Staff Judge Advocate’s
Recommendation (, or Addendum, if served upon me)) to submit matters. I understand that I
may request an extension of up to 20 additional days to submit matters and, for good cause, the
convening authority or that authority’s staff judge advocate may grant my request. [For a SCM,
insert:] I understand that I have 7 days from the date my sentence was announced to submit
matters for the convening authority's consideration. I understand that I may, for good cause,
apply to the convening authority, through the convening authority's staff judge advocate, for an
extension of the period.

3. I understand that the convening authority may, for any reason, disapprove findings of guilt to
any charge and/or specification, but may not change a finding of not guilty to guilty. I also
understand that the convening authority may, for any reason, disapprove a legal sentence,
mitigate [lessen] the sentence, or change a punishment to one of a different [but not more severe]
nature. I understand the convening authority may not increase the severity of the punishment.

4. My counsel has informed me that the convening authority has sole discretion to defer
sentences, including confinement, reduction in grade and (adjudged and/or mandatory)
forfeitures (as well as sole discretion to waive mandatory forfeitures of pay (and allowances)). I
hereby voluntarily elect that I will not submit any requests for a deferment or waiver.

consideration by the convening authority.

2. I have advised (Rank and Name of Accused) that (he)(she) may submit to the convening
authority any matters that may reasonably tend to affect the convening authority’s decision
whether to disapprove any findings of guilty or to approve all or any portion of the sentence.
This includes any allegations of errors affecting the legality of the findings or sentence; portions
of the record of trial and copies of documentary evidence offered or introduced at trial; matters in
mitigation which were not available for consideration at the court-martial; and clemency
recommendations from any person. I have also advised (him)(her) that the convening authority

mitigate (lessen) the sentence, or change a punishment to one of a different [but not more severe]
nature. I understand the convening authority may not increase the severity of the punishment.

4. My counsel has informed me that the convening authority has sole discretion to defer
sentences, including confinement, reduction in grade and (adjudged and/or mandatory)
forfeitures (, as well as sole discretion to waive mandatory forfeitures of pay (and allowances)).
I request that my prior request(s) be (approved)(reconsidered). (I do not specifically request any

4. [Note: If the defense raised legal errors in matters submitted under RCM 1105, address them

required forfeitures, and if applicable, include that upon application, the accused’s dependants
may also qualify for transitional compensation that may be approved in addition to any waived

6. I have considered all matters in the record of trial, including all matters presented in the pre-
sentencing portion of the trial. The sentence adjudged (is) (is not) appropriate for the offense(s)

                                          Chapter 10

                                COURT-MARTIAL ORDERS

10.1. General. A Court-Martial Order (CMO) is used to promulgate the result of trial and
action by the convening authority (initial action), and any subsequent action the convening
authority or higher authorities take on a case after the initial action (supplementary orders),
including the final order. Use the guidance in RCM 1114, Appendix 17, and Figures 10.1
through 10.9 to prepare and issue CMOs. See AFMAN 51-203, paragraph 10.5, for guidance on
convening authority action in SCMs.
10.2. Separate Orders. Use a separate CMO to announce the results for each accused tried,
whether or not they were tried jointly.
10.3. Authority to Publish Orders. This chapter is the sole authority for the publication of
CMOs. The appropriate convening authority publishes CMOs, or AFLOA/JAJM may direct
publication. Additionally, AFLOA/JAJ publishes final CMOs executing sentences in cases acted
on by TJAG, and AFLOA/JAJR publishes final CMOs in cases acted on by SecAF and the
President. In the event a convening authority’s command is deactivated, responsibility for
publication of orders falls to:
   10.3.1. The next higher level of command exercising GCMCA;
   10.3.2. A re-designated unit, when the initial order was published under its old designation;
   or
   10.3.3. A unit assuming the records, personnel, functions, etc., of an inactivated or
   transferred unit that published the initial order.
10.4. Authentication (Signature). The authority issuing the CMO signs it personally, or
delegates such authority. Paragraph 13.1.1. Do not designate a representative below the grade
of master sergeant. Include the signature block of the issuing authority and, if applicable, the
signature block of the person authenticating pursuant to a delegation. Only the person actually
authenticating the CMO signs it. The convening authority personally must sign a supplemental
order that comprises an action subsequent to the initial action. RCM 1114(b)(2).
10.5. Orders Promulgation. See Figures 10.1 through 10.9 for examples.
   10.5.1. Promulgate CMOs as follows:
       10.5.1.1. For GCMs, use a General Court-Martial Order. For SPCMs, use a Special
       Court-Martial Order. For SCMs, use a Summary Court-Martial Order. Prepare a
       summary court-martial order in SCMs resulting in acquittal of all charges and summary
       cases to promulgate a subsequent action of the convening authority.
       10.5.1.2. Number consecutively, starting with number one for each fiscal year.
       10.5.1.3. Above the heading of the first order of a fiscal year, cite the number of the last
       order published in the previous fiscal year. If no orders were published the preceding
       year, state there were no orders published in the previous fiscal year.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           193


       10.5.1.4. Continue CMOs of commands redesignated during a fiscal year in the same
       series of numbers. Cite the authority for the redesignation above the heading of the first
       page in the first order published after redesignation.
       10.5.1.5. For SCMs, CMOs are required for acquittals when the CA takes action after the
       initial action.
   10.5.2. Orders Logs.
       10.5.2.1. Have a separate CMO log for each type of court-martial and each convening
       authority. For example, a single-base GCMCA will have one log for SPCMs and one log
       for GCMs. Also, each SPCMCA at a base will each have his/her own log for SPCMs. A
       CMO log is in addition to the convening orders log.
       10.5.2.2. The log should reflect the CMO number assigned to a particular case. Hard
       copies, as opposed to electronic copies, of the original CMOs are stored with the CMO
       log.
10.6. Format. Use the following format. See also Figures 10.1 through 10.9:
   10.6.1. Single-sided on letter size paper.
   10.6.2. Margins. Leave a two-inch margin at the top and bottom of all pages, and a one-inch
   margin on the left and right side of all pages. On the first page of an order include the order
   number one-half inch from the bottom of the page at the left margin. Number the second and
   succeeding pages one-half inch from the bottom of the page at the left margin. On the first
   line of the second and succeeding pages, state the order number, headquarters and date of the
   CMO; e.g., SPCMO No. 3, HQ 71 FTW, Vance AFB, OK, 6 May 2011.
   10.6.3. Heading. Include “DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE,” the complete unit
   designation, the name of the MAJCOM abbreviated in parentheses, the mailing address, and
   the order number and date. See Figures 10.1 through 10.9.
   10.6.4. Body. Do not number paragraphs in the body. Center the headings titled
   “SENTENCE” and “ACTION” and use subparagraphs under each.
   10.6.5. Announcement of the Proceedings. State the accused’s grade at the time of
   arraignment, name, social security number, branch of service, and unit. State the location of
   the arraignment.
   10.6.6. Grade, Name. Always reflect the grade and name of an accused in capital letters.
   The first time the name is used, state the grade or title, first name, middle initial, last name.
   If the name is used again, use only the grade or title and last name. When referencing the
   accused after stating a reduction in grade was approved, use the accused’s reduced grade
   (e.g., when directing excess leave in the convening authority’s action).
   10.6.7. Abbreviations. Abbreviations from a standard dictionary, or AFH 33-337, The
   Tongue and Quill, may be used if they make the order clearer.
   10.6.8. Close. In the close, use the appropriate authority line depending on who
   authenticates the order, followed by the signature block of the person authenticating. For
   Department of the Air Force, use “BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR
   FORCE.” For the Air Force Academy, use “FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT.” For TJAG
   use “FOR THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL.” For all other units, use “FOR THE
 194                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   COMMANDER.” No authority line is required when the convening authority personally
   signs the CMO. Paralegals in grade E-7 thru E-9 must include duty titles.
10.7. Matters Unfit for Publication and Classified Matters.
   10.7.1. Unexpurgated and Expurgated CMOs. When the content of a CMO includes
   classified or other matters unfit for publication, prepare two versions of the CMO. The
   version with the content included is called the unexpurgated order. The version with the
   content replaced is called the expurgated order. Both the unexpurgated and the expurgated
   orders are the same order, and both carry the same order number and full distribution list. To
   avoid confusion between the recipients, on both versions mark the addressees of those who
   are to receive the unexpurgated copies with asterisks next to the number of copies and add,
   below the distribution list, “Recipients of unexpurgated CMO.” Make the following
   substitutions in the expurgated order:
       10.7.1.1. Names of children 16 years and under are always replaced with initials in both
       expurgated and unexpurgated CMOs (NOTE: Therefore, unless there is an independent
       reason to create an expurgated CMO, create only an unexpurgated CMO using just
       initials instead of names and mark the appropriate agencies for distribution for the
       unexpurgated copies);
       10.7.1.2. Names of adult sex offense victims are replaced with initials (regardless of
       verdict);
       10.7.1.3. Obscene language and matters are replaced with asterisks; and
       10.7.1.4. Classified information is replaced with asterisks (paragraph 10.7.2.2.)
   10.7.2. Distribution.
       10.7.2.1. Unexpurgated Orders. AFLOA/JAJM, AFPC/DPSFCM, the authorities of the
       command where the accused is held in custody or to which transferred, and the
       commander of the place where the accused is confined receive copies of the
       unexpurgated CMO.
       10.7.2.2. Expurgated Orders. Include the classified information only in the order
       provided to the command where the accused is held in custody or assigned and one copy
       of the order accompanying the original ROT forwarded to AFLOA/JAJM.
10.8. Initial Promulgating Orders. Initial CMOs promulgate the results of trial and any initial
action taken under Article 60, UCMJ. RCM 1114. It is important they accurately reflect the
proceedings of the court-martial.
   10.8.1. Preparing Orders. Prepare initial CMOs when the convening authority takes action
   on a case where the court returned any finding of guilty and a sentence.
       10.8.1.1. Orders in Cases without a Guilty Finding. Issue a CMO in trials terminated
       after arraignment but before findings (i.e., all charges dismissed or withdrawn, including
       upon declaration of a mistrial), and trials resulting in a finding of not guilty of all charges,
       including not guilty by reason of lack of mental responsibility and acquittals. Include the
       date of the termination or not guilty finding. Explain the circumstances of the
       termination. The date of the CMO is the same date it is published. Do not issue a CMO
       in trials terminated without findings before arraignment.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           195


     10.8.1.2. Rehearing or New Trial. Indicate in an initial CMO whether a case is a
     rehearing or new trial as shown in Figure 10.5.
  10.8.2. Form.
     10.8.2.1. Date. The date of the CMO is the same date the convening authority took
     action. If the convening authority did not take action (e.g., in an acquittal), the date of the
     CMO is the date it is published.
     10.8.2.2. Charges, Specifications, Pleas and Findings.          List the charges and
     specifications on which the accused was arraigned. After each charge and specification,
     abbreviate the plea and finding. Use “G” for guilty and “NG” for not guilty. If no plea
     was entered, state “None entered.” If an accused’s plea changed during trial, explain the
     circumstances surrounding the change. If no finding was entered, state the reason. The
     disposition of each charge and specification should be clear, including those amended,
     merged, withdrawn and/or dismissed.
        10.8.2.2.1. Summarized Specifications. RCM 1114(c) requires the promulgating
        order to contain at least a summary of the charges and specifications on which the
        accused was arraigned. Therefore, because the accused’s personal information is
        contained in the introductory paragraph of the CMO, it need not be repeated in the
        specification subparagraph. However, the remainder of the specification on which
        the accused was arraigned should be verbatim. Consider summarizing lengthy bad
        check specifications. Ensure any summarized specification includes factors such as
        value, amount or other such circumstances affecting maximum punishment. See
        Figures 10.1 through 10.5, 10.9.
        10.8.2.2.2. Lesser Included Offense (LIO); Exceptions and Substitutions. The charge
        should reflect any plea or findings of guilt to an LIO. When an accused pled or was
        found guilty by exceptions, the language in the specification being excepted should
        be verbatim. The plea or finding of the specification should accurately reflect the
        words being excepted and, if applicable, substituted. If found not guilty of the greater
        offense, but guilty of the LIO, then it should be NG of Art. X, but guilty of Art. Y.
        See Figures 10.1 and 10.2.
        10.8.2.2.3. Amendments. Indicate, in parentheses and after the affected portion of
        the specification, an amendment to a charge or specification made after arraignment.
        Figure 10.2.
        10.8.2.2.4. Renumbering of Charges. Use care in proofing CMOs involving charges
        and specifications withdrawn, dismissed or severed that result in renumbering of
        remaining charges and specifications. Charges and specifications withdrawn before
        arraignment do not appear in the CMO if the other charges were correctly
        renumbered. See paragraph 8.2.2; Figure 10.4.
     10.8.2.3. Sentence. State the forum that adjudged the sentence, the date the sentence was
     adjudged, and the adjudged sentence. When the convening authority orders a reprimand
     executed, place the language of the reprimand after the action and before the distribution.
     Make sure the reprimand language is included in the CA action.
 196                                                                  AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


       10.8.2.4. Action. Reflect the action taken by the convening authority under Article 60.
       On CMOs, the action may be summarized to the extent it does not repeat the accused’s
       personal information (which should be in the introductory paragraph). The remainder of
       the convening authority’s Action should be verbatim. When the convening authority
       mitigates an Action before publication or before the accused was notified of the action,
       the initial CMO reflects only the mitigated action. On CMOs, the wording of an action
       should follow the wording in the Action verbatim excluding the accused’s personal
       information. If an error occurs, CMOs should not be corrected, but rescinded and
       accomplished again.
10.9. Supplementary Orders. Promulgate any action taken on a case subsequent to the initial
action in a supplementary order. For example, use a supplementary order to suspend or remit a
sentence (RCM 1108), vacate an earlier suspension (RCM 1109), terminate deferment (RCM
1101(c)(7)), and take final action.
   10.9.1. Form. All supplementary orders contain the following:
       10.9.1.1. A cite to the initial CMO and any later CMOs modifying the findings, sentence
       or action.
       10.9.1.2. The date the sentence was adjudged and the trial forum.
       10.9.1.3. The ACM number assigned to the case.
   10.9.2. Convening Authority Signature. The convening authority personally signs all
   supplementary orders. See RCM 1114(b)(2).
   10.9.3. Order Vacating Suspension. To provide necessary data to confinement officers for
   computation of time to be served in confinement, include in CMOs promulgating the
   vacation of a suspension of confinement the information in MCM, Appendix 17(d), and the
   following additional information: the trial forum, the date the sentence was adjudged, the
   period of any deferment, any modification of confinement, and identifying data of any orders
   affecting the sentence to confinement.
   10.9.4. Article 64 Review. When the GCMCA is required to take action under RCM
   1112(e) in a non-BCD SPCM, ensure the CMO states the review is “pursuant to the authority
   of RCM 1112(f).” Ensure the cover and all CMOs are typed or stamped “64a Review,”
   signed and dated. See paragraph 11.4.
   10.9.5. Final Orders. A final order is a supplementary order used after appellate review is
   complete to promulgate a convening authority’s action and/or reflect modifications of
   findings and sentence. In addition, use a final order after withdrawal of appellate review and
   when the proceedings are abated upon the death of an accused during appellate review. A
   final order should reflect the post-trial and appellate history of the case, including actions
   taken by the convening authority, the appellate courts, SecAF and TJAG. Ensure that the
   GCMCA orders execute all dishonorable or bad conduct discharges, while SecAF orders
   execute all dismissals. RCM 1113(c)(1)(B) and (c)(2). In cases involving re-hearings, the
   final order reflects only modifications of the findings and sentence occurring after
   publication of the rehearing promulgating order.
   10.9.6. International Hold Situations. When the accused is overseas and being retained in a
   foreign country because of pending foreign criminal proceedings, consult AFJI 51-706 before
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         197


   issuing a CMO. This includes any order ordering the sentence executed; an initial order
   where Article 71, UCMJ, does not require further review before it may be ordered executed;
   or a supplemental order after completion of appellate action when the latter is required. See
   also AFI 51-703.
   10.9.7. Supplementary Orders When the Accused May Be Adjudged Two Punitive
   Discharges. An accused cannot be discharged twice from the same enlistment. If an accused
   has an approved punitive discharge from one court-martial and is facing another court-
   martial which may adjudge a more severe punitive discharge, execute the sentence from the
   first court-martial, except the discharge. If the accused receives a dishonorable discharge in
   the second court-martial after receiving a bad conduct discharge in the first court-martial,
   execute the dishonorable discharge after final appellate review of the second court-martial. If
   the approved sentence of the second court-martial includes a bad conduct discharge or no
   punitive discharge, do not delay execution of the first punitive discharge solely to wait for
   appellate review of the second court-martial. If the accused is discharged using the second
   punitive discharge, a supplementary order for the first court-martial must address the first
   discharge (e.g., the bad conduct discharge will not be executed because the accused was
   previously discharged in GCMO No. 1, this headquarters, dated 1 June 2011).
10.10. Corrected Copies.
   10.10.1. Do not amend CMOs. Issue a corrected copy to correct errors in the heading and
   close, the body of the order, the announcement of the proceedings, the action taken, and
   errors in typing or printing that make the order ambiguous. To correct a CMO, include the
   deleted matter with a line through it and leave it legible. If the correction is an addition,
   underscore the added matters. If the correction is a substitution, include both the deleted and
   the added matter, with the former lined out and the latter underscored. Identify it as a
   corrected copy in the heading by using “CORRECTED COPY – DESTROY ALL
   OTHERS.” NOTE: In cases involving sex offense and/or child victims (see paragraph
   10.7.1.1), if the corrected copy is expurgating an erroneously unexpurgated matter, do not
   include the previously unexpurgated text. The order number and date of the corrected copy
   remains the same as the original order. In the event additional corrections are required, the
   heading must reflect that the order is the second, third, etc., corrected copy. Incorporate
   changes from a previous corrected copy by deleting the language lined through and retaining
   the added language without the underscore. See Figure 10.4.
   10.10.2. Do not issue a corrected copy in any case in which a convening authority or
   reviewing authority withdraws an action and substitutes a new one. Prepare a new CMO
   rescinding the initial order. See Figure 10.9.
10.11. Distribution and Number of Copies. List recipients of the CMO distribution and the
number of copies beginning two spaces below the authentication signature element at the left
margin. Include the complete mailing address. For the most current distribution list see Figure
10.10. (NOTE: DO NOT mail additional copies of the CMO to AFLOA/JAJM because the
copies inserted in the record of trial are sufficient for what is required.)
10.12. Retention and Disposition of Original CMOs. SJAs are responsible for retaining the
original of their headquarters’ CMOs and retiring the record sets in annual blocks in accordance
with Air Force Records Disposition Schedule, Table 51-3.
 198                                                                  AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


10.13. Disposition of Stamped Orders. When orders are examined and noted as legally
sufficient under Article 64(a), UCMJ, permanently place 4 copies in the ROT. Only the original
must have an original signature. The others may be mechanically reproduced. Make distribution
in accordance with paragraphs 11.4.4. and 10.11.

                           CLEMENCY

Section 11A—General Information

11.1. Request for Appellate Defense Counsel. Include an AF Form 304, Request for Appellate
Defense Counsel, signed by the accused in every ROT forwarded for review by the Air Force
Court of Criminal Appeals or forwarded to The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) for
examination. AFMAN 51-203, Figure 4.1. The accused’s trial defense counsel assists the
accused in filling out the form, obtains the accused’s signature and submits it to the trial counsel
or appropriate SJA as soon as practicable after sentence announcement. If the member waives
appellate counsel, re-serve the AF Form 304 and obtain the member’s signature after the
convening authority has taken action on the case. Both copies of the AF Form 304 are placed in
the record of trial. The AF Form 304 provides the accused’s preferred mailing address (appellate
leave address, etc.) for all appellate review correspondence when the accused is not in a
confinement facility. An adequate address must be provided even if the accused waives
appellate review. Do not use the ADC office or the base organization address.
   11.1.1. If an accused’s death sentence by a court-martial has been approved by the President
   pursuant to Article 71, UCMJ, and the accused seeks to file a post-conviction habeas corpus
   petition in Federal civilian court concerning his/her court-martial, the accused may request a
   military defense counsel from The Judge Advocate General (TJAG). Upon receipt of the
   accused’s request, TJAG will detail military counsel under Article 70(e), UCMJ, to represent
   the accused in such proceedings and any appeals there from.
11.2. Withdrawal of Request for Appellate Defense Counsel. Use the following format to
withdraw a request for appellate defense counsel:
I consulted with my [military trial defense counsel] [civilian defense counsel], (insert counsel’s
name), and have been advised of the action taken by the court-martial convening authority in my
case. I received a copy of my record of trial for review. I am aware of my right to representation
by appellate counsel. I hereby withdraw the request for appellate counsel executed by me on
(insert date).

The accused may also decline appellate representation by checking the appropriate box on the
AF Form 304. If the accused initially declines appellate representation after sentence is
announced, the accused must be given another opportunity to elect or decline appellate
representation after the convening authority’s action is served upon the accused. See United
States v. Xu, 70 M.J. 140 (C.A.A.F. 2011) (Summary Disposition). In situations where the
accused has declined appellate representation after having been served the action, include both
versions of the AF Form 304 in the ROT. If the accused declines appellate representation,
forward only the original ROT to AFLOA/JAJM for appellate review.
11.3. Waiver or Withdrawal of Appellate Review. If an accused wishes to waive or withdraw
from appellate review, the procedures outlined in RCM 1110 must be followed. The request to
waive or withdraw from appellate review must be filed after the convening authority takes

action. The waiver or withdrawal of appellate review should be accomplished on a DD Form
2330, Waiver/Withdrawal of Appellate Rights in General and Special Courts-Martial Subject to
Review by a Court of Military Review, or DD Form 2331, Waiver/Withdrawal of Appellate
Rights in General Courts-Martial Subject to Examination in the Office of the Judge Advocate
General. MCM, Appendix 19 & 20. Waiver or withdrawal of appellate review bars review by
the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals and by TJAG under Article 69(a). It does not prevent
later submission of an Article 69(b) application. An Article 64(a) review is required for special
and general courts-martial where an accused waives appellate review. See Section 11B below
for additional information.
   11.3.1. A review by a judge advocate is required by RCM 1112. A judge advocate
   appointed by the SJA of the officer exercising GCM authority over the accused at the time of
   trial conducts the review. A memorandum must be prepared addressing issues in RCM
   1112(d) and inserted in the original record of trial, with copies inserted in all the copies of the
   record of trial and served on the accused. The case will be forwarded to the GCMCA for a
   supplemental order if: (1) the judge advocate who reviewed the case recommends corrective
   action; and, (2) the sentence approved by the convening authority includes a dismissal, a
   dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or more than six months confinement.

Section 11B—Article 64(a), UCMJ, Judge Advocate Reviews (RCM 1112)

11.4. Article 64(a) Review (RCM 1112). An Article 64(a), UCMJ, review is required in two
types of cases: 1) in any SPCM in which the approved sentence does not include a bad conduct
discharge and/or less than 12 months confinement; and, 2) in all SCMs. A judge advocate
appointed by the SJA of the officer exercising GCMCA over the accused at the time of trial
conducts the review. No review is required if the accused is found not guilty of all offenses, the
convening authority disapproved all findings of guilty or the accused is found not guilty for all
offenses only because of lack of mental responsibility for all offenses.
   11.4.1. Indicate compliance with Article 64(a) with a stamped or typed notation signed and
   dated by the reviewing officer on the cover of the first volume of all copies of the ROT and
   on all copies of the court-martial order. Only the original cover and court-martial order must
   have an original signature. The others may be mechanically reproduced.
   11.4.2. If all judge advocates on the GCM convening authority’s staff are disqualified from
   conducting such a review or the GCM convening authority is disqualified from taking any
   required action on the case, the MAJCOM SJA will select another GCM convening authority
   and SJA to perform the review and take any required action. If there is no eligible convening
   authority in the command, or if the major commander is the convening authority, the
   MAJCOM SJA may request another MAJCOM commander to act or to designate a
   commander exercising GCM convening authority within that other MAJCOM to take action
   on the case. If agreement cannot be reached between MAJCOMs, contact AFLOA/JAJM for
   assistance in identifying an officer exercising GCM convening authority to act on the case.
   11.4.3. Form and Content of the Review.
       11.4.3.1. Reviews of these courts-martial will contain only those matters required by
       Article 64(a). In those cases in which no corrective action is required by the convening
       authority, the review will consist of a stamped or typed entry on the cover of volume one
216                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


      of the original ROT, and on the back of the DD Form 2329, Record of Trial by Summary
      Court-Martial, and on all the court-martial orders for non-BCD SPCM cases. The entry
      shall be entitled, “Article 64(a), UCMJ, Review” and shall consist of the conclusions
      required in Article 64(a), the command of reviewer, the date, signature of the reviewer,
      and the reviewer’s signature block.
      11.4.3.2. In cases where the review addresses allegations of error by the accused, but no
      corrective action of the convening authority is required; the review will be prepared in
      writing IAW Article 64(b), dated and signed by the reviewer, will cover the matters
      required by Art 64(a), and will include a statement that the findings and sentence are
      correct in law and fact. The review will be attached to the ROT. The cover (DD Form
      490) of volume one and all copies of the court-martial order will be annotated with a
      typed or stamped notation consisting of the date, signature block, the command of the
      reviewer, and a statement that Article 64(a), UCMJ, has been complied with.
      11.4.3.3. When the officer exercising GCM jurisdiction over the accused at the time the
      court-martial was convened is required to take corrective or further action under Article
      64, UCMJ, the judge advocate’s review will be in writing, dated and signed by the
      reviewer, and will address the matters required in Art 64 (b) as well as whether the
      findings and sentence are correct in law and fact. After the convening authority takes
      action IAW Article 64(c), the review and action will be included in the ROT.
         11.4.3.3.1. In cases where the review stated that corrective action was required as a
         matter of law, and the convening authority refused to take action that was at least as
         favorable to the accused as that recommended by the reviewer, the ROT, review and
         action of the convening authority shall be transmitted to TJAG through
         AFLOA/JAJM for review under Article 69(b), UCMJ.
         11.4.3.3.2. If the officer taking action under Article 64, UCMJ, orders a rehearing,
         the ROT, action and court-martial order will be sent to the officer who convened the
         court-martial. That officer will determine whether a rehearing is practicable. See
         Section 11F. If a rehearing is to be held and the accused has been transferred to
         another command, the officer who convened the court-martial will make
         arrangements for the rehearing with the coordination of the officer presently
         exercising SPCM jurisdiction over the accused.
      11.4.3.4. Except cases requiring Article 69, UCMJ, review under RCM 1112(g),
      Secretarial action under Article 71, UCMJ, or rehearings, cases are final under Article 76,
      UCMJ, upon completion of the judge advocate’s review and any required action by the
      GCM convening authority. The GCM convening authority’s action may execute all
      unexecuted portions of the sentence except those portions requiring Secretarial approval
      under Article 71, UCMJ.
         11.4.3.4.1. If the GCMCA orders a rehearing, forward the review, ROT, action, and
         court-martial order to the convening authority that convened the court-martial. This
         convening authority determines whether a rehearing is practicable.
  11.4.4. Distribution of Article 64(a) Reviews. After completing the Article 64(a) review
  and, when applicable, any action by the GCMCA under RCM 1112(f), forward the original
  ROT and four copies of the court-martial order and any supplementary orders to
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          217


   AFLOA/JAJM indicating compliance with Article 64(a) as stated in paragraph 11.4.3.
   Provide one copy each of the annotated court-martial order indicating compliance with
   Article 64(a) to each addressee as required by paragraph 10.11, as applicable.

Section 11C—Article 69, UCMJ, Review

11.5. Article 69(a) Review (RCM 1201(b)(1)). The ROT in each GCM that is not otherwise
reviewed under Article 66 shall be examined in the Office of The Judge Advocate General if
there is a finding of guilty and the accused does not waive or withdraw his right to appellate
review under Article 61.
   11.5.1. Submission of Matters by the Accused. The accused may submit matters for TJAG’s
   consideration. Any matters must be submitted directly to AFLOA/JAJM on or before the
   thirtieth (30) day after the date the GCMCA approved the sentence, unless the accused
   establishes good cause for not filing matters within that time. Submissions must meet the
   requirements of paragraph 11.6.3.
   11.5.2. Notification of Article 69(a) Examination Results. AFLOA/JAJM notifies the
   convening authority’s SJA of the examination results. If TJAG does not direct a review by
   the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA), AFLOA/JAJM forwards a copy of the
   initial promulgating order to the convening authority’s SJA, reflecting the results of the
   review. AFLOA/JAJM serves one copy of the order upon the accused and obtains a receipt
   for it. If the defense counsel’s name and address is included in matters submitted by the
   accused, AFLOA/JAJM sends a copy of the results to the defense counsel.
   11.5.3. Other Action by TJAG. If TJAG orders a rehearing, the procedures in Section 11F
   will apply. If TJAG forwards the case for review by AFCCA, the GCMCA’s SJA will, upon
   request, send two copies of the ROT to AFLOA/JAJM.
11.6. Application for Relief under Article 69(b) (RCM 1201(b)(3)). The Judge Advocate
General may vacate or modify the findings or sentence, or both, reassess the sentence, or set
aside the findings or sentence and order a rehearing of a court-martial case which has become
final in law but has not been reviewed by the AFCCA or TJAG. RCM 1201(b). This applies to
GCMs, SPCMs, and SCMs including those cases forwarded under RCM 1112(g)(1). The
findings or sentence, or both, may be reviewed on any ground specified in RCM 1201(b)(3)(A).
Review of a finding of not guilty, only by reason of lack of mental responsibility, under this rule
may not extend to the determination of lack of mental responsibility. RCM 1201(b)(3)(A),
Discussion.
   11.6.1. Prerequisite of Finality of Review. An application may not be filed and will not be
   reviewed under Article 69(b), UCMJ, unless the convening authority has taken action, and a
   judge advocate completed the review and any other action required by Article 64, UCMJ.
   11.6.2. Submission of Application. The member sends the application directly to
   AFLOA/JAJM, and it is considered filed when received by that office.
       11.6.2.1. If the application concerns a trial by SCM with action taken before 1 Jul 96, the
       GCMCA’s SJA obtains the ROT, and any other statements, documents, matters admitted,
       or, in the alternative, summaries of the substance of such evidence, from the SJA for the
       installation at which the trial was held and forwards all the documents to AFLOA/JAJM.

   11.6.3. Contents of Application. Figure 11.1 is a sample format for applications. In all
   cases, the application must be written and signed by the accused, or the applicant’s legal
   representative, under oath or affirmation. Defense counsel does not receive a copy of
   TJAG’s action, unless counsel’s name is on the application. The application must also
   contain:
       11.6.3.1. The accused’s name, social security number, and present mailing address;
       11.6.3.2. The date and place of trial and type of court-martial;

       for the relief (a concise brief of the applicable law with appropriate citations is
       encouraged); and
       11.6.3.5. Any documentary or other evidence pertinent to the facts asserted under the
       specific grounds alleged, including copies of the court-martial order, if available.
       11.6.3.6. The application must be notarized.

under RCM 1201(b)(1), in which, upon petition by the accused and on good cause shown,
USCAAF has granted a review.
11.9. Petition for Supreme Court Review by Writ of Certiorari. Petitions for Supreme Court
review by writ of certiorari may be filed by the accused or the United States in those cases

   appoint appellate government counsel to represent the United States in any cases filed under
   Article 67a above.

Section 11E—Petitions for New Trial (RCM 1210).
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           219


11.10. Petition for New Trial. Petitions for new trial are prepared and processed under RCM
1210, and are filed with AFLOA/JAJM on behalf of The Judge Advocate General. A petition for
new trial may be submitted because of newly discovered evidence or fraud on the court in any
kind of court-martial within two years after approval of the sentence by the convening authority.
   11.10.1. General Information. The petition must be in writing and contain the matters
   required by RCM 1210(c). When practicable, the petition should be typewritten and double-
   spaced. The petition will be signed under oath or affirmation by the petitioner, a person
   possessing the power of attorney of the petitioner for that purpose, or a person with the
   authorization of an appropriate court of law to sign the petition as the petitioner’s
   representative. The member forwards the original and two copies of the petition and

   11.10.3. TJAG Review of the Petition. If the petitioner’s case is not pending before a court,
   TJAG or the officer(s) designated by TJAG shall review the petition. Upon request by the
   designated officer(s), TJAG shall appoint appellate defense counsel and appellate
   government counsel to act in the case. Upon such appointment, the designated officer(s)
   shall forward one copy of the petition and all documents to each appellate counsel. The
   designated officer(s) may direct appellate defense and government counsel to provide briefs
   in the case and upon written request or, if the designated officer(s) deem(s) it appropriate,
   may order oral arguments to be presented before the officer(s).
       11.10.3.1. Process for Filing Briefs Requiring TJAG Review of the Petition.
           11.10.3.1.1. Form and Number of Briefs. Briefs are to be typewritten, double spaced
           on letter size white paper in an original and three copies. Counsel shall be limited to
           filing one brief per side unless TJAG or the designated officer(s) reviewing the
           petition otherwise permit(s).
           11.10.3.1.2. Time for Filing. The brief on behalf of the petitioner shall be filed with
           AFLOA/JAJM within 20 days after appellate defense counsel has been appointed by
           TJAG and a copy of the petition and supporting documents have been provided
           counsel. Appellate government counsel may file a brief within 20 days of when the
           petitioner’s brief has been filed. If counsel for the petitioner has filed no brief,
           appellate government counsel will file a brief within 20 days after expiration of the
           time allowed for the filing of a brief on behalf of the petitioner. Upon written request,
 220                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


           the time for filing briefs by either counsel may be extended at the discretion of TJAG

           petitioner has the right to make opening and closing arguments.
           11.10.3.2.4. Failure to Appear. Appellate counsel’s failure to appear at the time and
           place set for oral argument may be regarded as a waiver thereof and the designated
           officer(s) may proceed on the case as submitted without argument or may continue
           the case for argument at a later date, giving due notice thereof.
           11.10.3.2.5. Presence of Petitioner. The petitioner does not have a right to be present
           at the time of oral arguments before the designated officer(s).

       action as may be necessary to carry out the orders of TJAG as contained in the action.

Section 11F—Rehearings and Other Remedial Actions

11.11. Cases Remanded by the Appellate Courts. When a decision of the Supreme Court,
USCAAF, or AFCCA directs or authorizes further proceedings, such as a rehearing, a limited
hearing, or a new action by the convening authority (CA), reasonable efforts must be made to
locate the accused and provide the accused with a copy of the decision. Further proceedings in
AFCCA cases need not be delayed, however, solely to permit an accused to petition for a grant
of review or otherwise appeal the matter. Any special instructions deemed necessary to carry out
the mandate of the Court will be transmitted by AFLOA/JAJM with the remanded ROT.
   11.11.1. Pursuant to Article 76(a), an accused may only be placed on involuntary appellate
   leave when the approved sentence includes a punitive discharge. When an appellate court
   sets aside the action or the sentence, the accused should be taken off of appellate leave.
   Figure 11.2.
11.12. Procedure When Rehearing is Authorized (RCM 810). When an order of a reviewing
or convening authority, an order of TJAG, a decision of AFCCA, a mandate issued by USCAAF,
or a judgment of the Supreme Court authorizes a rehearing on the findings or sentence, the
following procedures apply:
   11.12.1. Notification of the CA and Identification of the Responsible CA. AFLOA/JAJM,
   or the Article 64, UCMJ, reviewing officer, as appropriate, sends a transmittal letter, and a
   copy of the pertinent decision, mandate, or order to the original CA’s SJA (or the current CA
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         221


  if the original CA no longer exists). If the accused is no longer within the command of the
  original CA, a courtesy copy will be forwarded to the accused’s current CA with jurisdiction
  to convene the type of court-martial involved.
     11.12.1.1. The original court-martial CA is the CA who approved the accused’s
     sentence. The original CA is the responsible CA if the accused is still under his or her
     jurisdiction.
     11.12.1.2. If the accused is no longer under the jurisdiction of the original CA, the
     original CA decides whether to remain the responsible CA or transfer his or her
     responsibilities for the case to the officer presently exercising authority over the accused
     to convene the type of court-martial involved. If transferred, the current CA becomes the
     responsible CA.
         11.12.1.2.1. If the original CA remains the responsible CA and determines that a
         rehearing should be held, he or she will request that the accused be returned for the
         purpose of rehearing or will reach an understanding as to situs with the officer
         presently exercising court-martial CA over the accused or with another officer
         exercising court martial CA.
     11.12.1.3. If the original CA no longer exists, the accused’s current CA, exercising
     authority over the accused to convene the type of court-martial involved, is the
     responsible CA.
  11.12.2. Receipt of Decision and Speedy Trial Clock. Receipt of decision by the original
  CA’s (or the current CA if the original CA no longer exists) SJA triggers the speedy trial
  clock for both rehearings on findings and rehearings on sentence only. In a sentence-only
  rehearing, an accused is “brought to trial” at the first Article 39(a) session. United States v.
  Becker, 53 MJ 229 (CAAF 2000); RCM 707(b)(3)(D).
  11.12.3. Notification of the Accused and Counsel. When a post-trial review or action directs
  or authorizes further proceedings, the responsible CA’s SJA must make reasonable efforts to
  locate and provide both the accused and trial defense counsel with a copy of the document
  requiring additional action. Ensure receipts are accomplished.
  11.12.4. Action. The responsible CA should ensure action is taken consistent with the post-
  trial directions from the reviewing or appellate authority. The responsible CA will publish a
  supplementary court-martial order indicating either:
     11.12.4.1. A rehearing is ordered before another court-martial to be designated. See
     Figure 10.5 for sample language for rehearing on sentence; or
     11.12.4.2. If a rehearing on sentence is impracticable, that the sentence has been set-
     aside and a sentence of no punishment is approved; or
     11.12.4.3. If a rehearing on findings is impracticable, that the findings of guilt and the
     sentence have been set aside and the charges are dismissed.
  11.12.5. Ensure appropriate coordination is made with all counsel, and military judge.
  11.12.6. Sentence Reassessment. When partial findings have been approved and a rehearing
  as to other offenses and the sentence ordered, the convening authority may, if specifically
  authorized by either AFCCA or USCAAF, reassess the sentence based on the approved
 222                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   findings of guilty and dismiss the remaining charges, if any. RCM. 1107(e)(1)(B)(iii),
   Discussion.
11.13. Referral. Whether re-referring the matter to a rehearing in full or for a limited purpose,
ensure that the following actions are accomplished:
   11.13.1. The responsible CA directs the rehearing. This may be done at any location the
   convening authority determines to be appropriate. If the rehearing is held at a location
   requiring the accused to travel, the accused should be placed on TDY. See Figure 6.8.
   11.13.2. A military judge is detailed. The military judge may be the same as in the original
   trial or a new one may be detailed.
   11.13.3. A new convening order is published with all new members.
   11.13.4. A new referral indorsement in the same form as on page 2 of the Charge Sheet, DD
   Form 458, is completed following normal rules of referral.
       11.13.4.1. The appropriate instructions concerning the rehearing are incorporated on the
       referral form.
       11.13.4.2. The new referral is attached to the original referral. See paragraph 4.9.
11.14. Record of Trial and Post-Rehearing Concerns.
   11.14.1. The original ROT and any copies must remain intact, except for documents needed
   for reintroduction at rehearing, such as the charge sheet and exhibits, if required.
   11.14.2. Any documents withdrawn from the original ROT and used at the rehearing should
   be substituted in the record and all copies with a description of the document, reasons for
   withdrawal, and new location of the document should be included. Do not withdraw the
   original copies of a decision of a court, action of a convening authority, post-trial review or
   recommendation, pretrial advice, and Article 32 report of investigation.
   11.14.3. If the accused served confinement resulting from the original trial, the convening
   authority’s new action must reflect that the accused will be credited for the time served.
   11.14.4. The promulgating order must indicate the case is a rehearing. See Figure 10.5.
   11.14.5. The record of the rehearing is a separate volume from the original ROT. Place the
   record of rehearing on top of the original ROT. Other volumes are renumbered as
   appropriate.
   11.14.6. A verbatim transcript is required for a rehearing proceeding. Forward the original
   and two copies of the verbatim rehearing record, along with the original ROT, to
   AFLOA/JAJM.
11.15. DuBay Hearing. A DuBay hearing is a post-trial hearing ordered by an appellate court
for the limited purpose of obtaining further evidence on a matter under consideration by the
court. While the MCM does not explicitly address this type of limited fact-finding hearing,
DuBay procedure is a well-established means to address an ambiguity or omission in the record;
or to dispose of a claim of error before necessary witnesses disperse, memories fade, or
witnesses became unavailable. United States v. DuBay, 37 C.M.R. 411 (C.M.A. 1967). DuBay
hearings on various matters may be directed by the CAAF, AFCCA, convening and supervisory
authorities, or the detailed military judge on his or her own motion prior to authentication of the
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          223


ROT, so long as the subject of the proceeding is “one that can be verified without material
prejudice to the substantial rights of the accused.” U.S. v. Brickey, 16 M.J. 258 (C.M.A. 1983).
The following procedures apply when a DuBay hearing is ordered:
   11.15.1. Notification of CA. AFLOA/JAJM sends a letter of transmittal and a copy of the
   pertinent mandate or order to the SJA of the CA who exercised such authority over the
   accused at the time of the trial (or the current CA if the original CA no longer exists). If the
   accused is no longer within the command of the original CA, a courtesy copy will be
   forwarded to the accused’s current CA who has the authority to convene the type of court-
   martial involved.
       11.15.1.1. The responsible CA, as identified in paragraph 11.13.1, must ensure action is
       taken consistent with the post-trial directions from the authority directing the DuBay
       hearing. The responsible CA will publish a supplementary court-martial order reflecting
       post-trial action on the case.
       11.15.1.2. Receipt of Decision and Time Standards. There are no formal time standards
       for completion of the hearing, however the matter should be expedited as appellate
       review is pending. Additionally, the appellate court directing the hearing generally
       specifies a date by which the process must be completed. Any time extension requests
       require coordination with AFLOA/JAJG through AFLOA/JAJM.
   11.15.2. Notification of the Accused and Counsel. When a post-trial review or action directs
   a DuBay hearing, the responsible CA’s SJA must make reasonable efforts to locate and
   provide both the accused and trial defense counsel with a copy of the document requiring
   additional action. Ensure receipts are accomplished.
       11.15.2.1. The accused should be returned to active duty status for the limited purpose of
       participating in the DuBay hearing. Figure 11.3.
       11.15.2.2. Appointment Letter. The SJA prepares a letter for the responsible CA to sign
       directing the DuBay hearing to take place. Figure 11.4.
   11.15.3. Detail of a Military Judge. After appropriate coordination, the SJA drafts a letter
   for the CA requesting a military judge be detailed and directing a hearing date to be
   scheduled. A military judge is detailed to a DuBay hearing in the same manner as detailed to
   any court-martial.
   11.15.4. DuBay hearings are conducted in accordance with Article 39(a), UCMJ.
   11.15.5. Exhibits. Number items admitted as evidence at the hearing numerically, beginning
   with “Hearing Exhibit 1.”
   11.15.6. Record of Hearing and Post Hearing Action. Prepare a verbatim record of the
   hearing, unless otherwise directed by the authority ordering the hearing. Authenticate the
   transcript of the hearing in the same format as required for ROTs. Return the original ROT
   and the original DuBay transcript and two copies of the DuBay transcript to AFLOA/JAJM.

Section 11G—Remission and Suspension Under Article 74, UCMJ

11.16. General Information. After the action is published or the accused has been officially
notified of the action, the SecAF has the authority to remit or suspend any part or amount of the
 224                                                                  AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


unexecuted part of any sentence, except one approved by the President, unless the SecAF
delegated such authority in this section.
   11.16.1. The term “unexecuted part of a sentence” includes that part which has been
   approved and ordered executed but which has not been carried out (e.g., punitive discharges
   or dismissals not ordered into execution, unserved confinement, hard labor without
   confinement or restriction, and uncollected forfeitures).
11.17. Authority Reserved to SecAF. Only SecAF may remit or suspend, any part or amount
of the unexecuted part of the sentences listed below. This limitation does not apply to the
convening authority’s powers under RCM 1107; Article 60, UCMJ.
   11.17.1. Any sentence of a person convicted by a military tribunal, under SecAF’s
   jurisdiction, resulting from the President’s commutation of a sentence of death to a lesser
   punishment (RCM 1206 (b)(3);
   11.17.2. Any sentence SecAF approved and ordered into execution;
   11.17.3. A dismissal, dishonorable discharge, or bad conduct discharge that is imposed for
   the conviction of an offense when a sentence to death is authorized by the MCM;
   11.17.4. Those referred to SecAF for action by commanders authorized to exercise Article
   74, UCMJ, authority. Commanders are encouraged to forward to AFLOA/JAJR for SecAF
   decision those cases involving issues most appropriate for resolution at the Air Force policy
   level.
11.18. Authority of TJAG. TJAG may exercise SecAF authority under Article 74(a), UCMJ,
and remit or suspend in whole or in part any unexecuted part of a sentence, with the exception of
those cases specified in paragraph 11.17. The Director, USAF Judiciary, may act for TJAG to
remit or suspend up to 90 days of an approved sentence to confinement.
11.19. Authority of the Accused’s Commander. Except in cases listed in paragraph 11.17 and
where TJAG has not acted, the commander of the accused who has the authority to convene a
court-martial of the kind which adjudged the sentence may suspend or remit any part or amount
of the unexecuted part of an accused’s sentence adjudged by a summary court-martial or a
SPCM, except for a BCD, regardless of whether the person acting has previously approved the
sentence.
   11.19.1. A commander exercising only SPCMCA over the command to which the accused is
   assigned may not remit a BCD, but may suspend a BCD only in the initial action.
   11.19.2. A commander exercising GCMCA over the command to which the accused is
   assigned may remit or suspend any part or amount of the unexecuted part of any sentence
   except in cases listed in paragraph 11.17.
   11.19.3. If the accused is transferred to a Level II Regional Confinement Facility or a long-
   term corrections facility, as defined in AFI 31-205, or to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and
   the accused has been assigned to HQ AFSFC/SFC, this authority will be exercised only by
   the Commander, AFDW, the officer exercising GCMCA over Air Force personnel in those
   institutions.
11.20. Publication of SecAF Actions under Article 74, UCMJ. Promulgate actions taken by
the SecAF in cases specified in paragraph 11.17 in appropriate GCM orders. RCM 1114(b).
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           225


The Director, Air Force Personnel Council and TJAG are authorized to announce the action
taken by SecAF in all other cases.

Excess Leave.
MEMORANDUM FOR (Accused)

FROM: HQ 11 WG/CC
      (Address)

SUBJECT: Required Excess Leave for (accused)

1. On 15 May 2009, your sentence to a bad-conduct discharge was approved by the convening
authority for 11 WG and you were directed to take involuntary leave pursuant to Article 76(a),
Uniform Code of Military Justice. On 6 July 2011, the [Air Force Court of Criminal
Appeals][United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces] set aside the [action of the
convening authority][findings of guilt and the sentence][sentence].

[Set aside action of the convening authority]

2. Because the Court set aside the action of the convening authority, you must elect one of the
following options:

   a. Continue on voluntary appellate leave, in a non-pay status, until a new action of the
convening authority is taken in your case; or

  b. Be restored to active duty and placed in a casual status at HQ 11 Wing, Joint Base
Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington.

3. If your sentence, which included a bad-conduct discharge, is approved, your voluntary excess
leave, should you elect it, will be cancelled and you will then be required, under Article 76(a),
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), to take involuntary leave pending completion of
appellate review of your conviction by court-martial.

4. While on voluntary excess leave, you will remain a member of the United States Air Force on
active duty and subject to the UCMJ, to lawful orders and regulations, and to recall from
required leave as provided in paragraph 5. You and your family members are entitled to medical
care, use of military exchange facilities and commissaries, and other military welfare benefits.
Because these entitlements may be curtailed or terminated for cause, you and your family
members must maintain proper conduct while using them and follow all applicable rules. In
order for you to make use of these benefits, you and your family members will be issued
appropriate identification cards of limited duration.

5. It is important that you provide a correct leave address and report any changes in address.
Failure to do so may result in loss of valuable opportunities to recoup pay and allowances to
which you may be entitled if your sentence is disapproved or set aside, and it could prevent you
from receiving important instructions. Further, you are subject to recall from voluntary excess
leave. Failure to return promptly to your unit, if so directed by order delivered to you in person
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           227


or mailed to you at your leave address, could result in your being placed in absent without leave
or desertion status.

[Set aside findings of guilt and sentence][sentence]

2. Because the [Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals][United States Court of Appeals for the
Armed Forces] set aside the [findings and sentence][sentence] in your case, you are no longer on
required excess leave and will be restored to active duty. You are required to contact the Force
Support Flight at JB Andrews on (date). If you have any questions, contact 11 FSS/DPM, at
(phone number).

FROM: (Convening Authority)

SUBJECT: DuBay Hearing - United States v. (Grade and Name of Accused)

1. As the (general) (special) court-martial convening authority in the case of United States v.
(Name of Accused), I request that you convene a limited hearing at (Air Force Base and State) in
the above styled case. The hearing should be conducted in accordance with Article 39(a),

                                          Chapter 12

   AUTOMATED MILITARY JUSTICE ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
                            (AMJAMS)

Section 12A—General Information

12.1. Purpose. The purpose of AMJAMS is to collect data pertaining to investigations,
nonjudicial punishment imposed pursuant to Article 15, UCMJ, trials by court-martial, and
related military justice activity. The information collected is required:
   12.1.1. To conduct statistical studies that measure disciplinary rates and trends and evaluate
   military justice involvement as it affects the quality of the force and the personnel needs of
   the service;
   12.1.2. To provide various management reports to judge advocate personnel at all levels;
   12.1.3. To provide statistical data to the Department of Defense concerning military justice;
   12.1.4. To provide raw data to the Defense Incident Based Reporting System (DIBRS); and,
   12.1.5. To reply to inquiries concerning military justice.
12.2. Program Uses. AMJAMS collects detailed information on offenses and processing
timelines as well as demographic information on the participants in the judicial and nonjudicial
punishment process. The information from AMJAMS provides effective management tools for
use by Headquarters USAF, major commands, general and special court-martial jurisdictions, the
judiciary, and the appellate divisions. When used properly, the information will assist in
eliminating or highlighting excessive processing delays and in monitoring the current status of
military justice actions from the investigation stage through to completion of the appellate
process.
12.3. Policy. AMJAMS inputs are to be timely, complete, and accurate. Timely collecting,
reporting, and processing of military justice information is essential to staff judge advocates at
all levels. Inputs are to be completed as soon as possible after a military justice “event” occurs
in a case, beginning with the Investigation Module. For the purpose of this Instruction, “events”
are defined as data fields in AMJAMS. If the data field is applicable to a case, an input should
be made as soon as the data is available and updated as the need arises. Refer to the online Help
Topics in AMJAMS for detailed instructions on data entry.

Section 12B— Data Entry

12.4. Responsibilities.
   12.4.1. Base and GCM staff judge advocate personnel are primarily responsible for all
   AMJAMS data entry except appellate data. AMJAMS data should be complete and accurate
   upon input.
   12.4.2. GCM staff judge advocate personnel are primarily responsible for reviewing all
   AMJAMS inputs for completeness and accuracy with regard to those entries for which they
   are responsible, not to include appellate data.
 230                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   12.4.3. AFLOA/JAJM and appellate court personnel are primarily responsible for data entry
   in the TJAG and appellate folders.

Section 12C—Investigations

12.5. Investigations. New cases should be opened in AMJAMS as investigations immediately
upon becoming aware of a potential Article 15, court-martial, or circumstances reportable as a
special interest case. When data entry would potentially compromise an investigation, delayed
data entry is authorized. Report circumstances of incident via email.
   12.5.1. Member data. This section has six tabs: Member, Race, Career/Pay, Duty Status,
   Prior Actions, and Commander. All of them are equally important and for the most part,
   self-explanatory. The information found in these tabs is pulled into AMJAMS from a file
   that is loaded from AFPC monthly. These fields should be edited or manually entered if
   changes have occurred in personal data since the AFPC update or if an area is left blank by
   AFPC. Fields not populated by the AFPC data pull may require user inputs. Manual input of
   Reserve members will likely be required.
   12.5.2. Text Fields. Three text fields are provided for specific types of data. Information
   that is or should be entered in a specific field elsewhere in the database should not be entered
   in any text field.
       12.5.2.1. Case Status. Enter data describing the current status of the case. Valid data for
       this field may include information regarding situations that may delay or otherwise affect
       the processing of the case, i.e. “Commander TDY until_____________; Accused
       hospitalized until; Defense counsel unavailable until;” etc. Enter a “Current as of” date
       each time this field is updated.
       12.5.2.2. Case Notes. Legal offices may enter day-to-day notes in this field that provide
       useful information in the administrative processing of the case. Text fields, if applicable,
       should be entered in reverse chronological order (i.e. current information on top).
       12.5.2.3. Narrative Description. Enter enough information in sufficient detail to provide
       a clear understanding of the facts and circumstances involved in the case (who, what,
       when, where, how) for each offense investigated. This field should be updated as
       significant events occur. Also, do not put any information in this field that could
       compromise an ongoing investigation.
   12.5.3. Special Interest Cases. If the case contains one of the qualifying criteria listed in
   Section 13E of this Instruction, designate the case as a special interest case by selecting
   “YES,” NAF/MAJCOM reporting required. If the case is disposed of through an Article 15
   and falls within the reporting requirements of Section 13E, report the case to AFLOA/JAJM
   by SIR until punishment is imposed. If the case is disposed of through court-martial and falls
   within the reporting requirements of Section 13E, report the case to AFLOA/JAJM by SIR
   until sentence is announced or other terminating disposition. If the case does not qualify for
   special interest reporting to AFLOA/JAJM, but does meet MAJCOM or NAF special interest
   reporting requirements, select “YES” NAF/MAJCOM reporting required on the
   NAF/MAJCOM Reporting pane. Even if the case is disposed of by an administrative action
   (separation, LOR, LOA, etc.) continue to report the case to AFLOA/JAJM by SIR until
   completion.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           231


   12.5.4. Investigative Info. Add the appropriate investigating agency, jurisdiction, date of the
   report of investigation, and date the offense was discovered.
   12.5.5. Pending Offenses. All offenses and violations being investigated must be entered in
   this module regardless of jurisdiction. For civilian investigations, input offenses that closely
   coincide with the civilian code violations. Offenses should not be deleted from this area once
   the case has been disposed.
       12.5.5.1. Case Information. Complete each field to include the STC Consultation on
       Sexual Assault Cases. Consultation with STC/JAJG is encouraged prior to the preferral
       or disposition of the allegation in sexual assault cases. If Other/No contact reason is
       marked, enter the reason in the text field.
   12.5.6. Investigation Personnel. The folder has three tabs – Defense Counsel, Investigation
   POC, and Base POC. Use the local look-up tables to add these persons under their affiliated
   tabs. If there is more than one counsel, add them as appropriate. When the investigation is
   converted to an Article 15 or court-martial, these names will copy down to Article 15
   personnel folder or trial personnel folder. Do not delete personnel from this folder if they
   had any involvement in the case. If personnel are later replaced, add new personnel and
   indicate on the tab that they are the current contact person.
   12.5.7. Restraint. If restraint is imposed on the member (military or civilian) during the
   investigation phase, add this folder and enter the type of restraint imposed, dates imposed,
   and date of the pretrial hearing if applicable. Keep in mind that restriction imposed as a
   result of an investigation is considered a form of restraint.
   12.5.8. Case Disposition. Cases must be disposed of immediately upon the commander’s
   determination of forum. For cases processed by civilian authorities, the cases will remain in
   the investigation status until resolution of alleged offenses.

Section 12D—Pretrial

12.6. Pretrial. All folders and corresponding fields that apply to a particular case must be
completed in their entirety. AMJAMS report criteria and logic may be dependent upon any
number of fields in AMJAMS and not necessarily those used at base or NAF level. It is
imperative for database integrity that the fields within the area of control at base and NAF level
be completed if applicable to the case.
   12.6.1. Folders. Add folders to the AMJAMS case tree as cases progress through the
   military justice process. Do not add folders that do not apply (e.g. If the member did not
   request IMDC, do not add that folder, etc.).
       12.6.1.1. Pretrial Information. This folder contains the Case Ready Date. The date is
       copied to this folder from the Investigation module and can only be edited in the
       Investigation module. It also calculates the Speedy trial date. Input fields that recalculate
       the speedy trial date are located in the Trial delay folder.
       12.6.1.2. Discharge Request. Annotate whether the member requested discharge in lieu
       of trial or for officers, resignation for the good of the service (RILO). This field is
       mandatory even if the member does not request discharge. If the member initially does
232                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


      not request discharge, but later changes his option, update the discharge fields using the
      same discharge folder to reflect the request and the action taken.
      12.6.1.3. Pretrial Restraint. The restraint folder may be added at any time the need
      arises. Add every instance of pretrial restraint, reflect all hearing dates, and the date
      restraint was terminated in this folder. If pretrial restraint does not terminate until the
      date of sentence or acquittal, the termination date will be entered automatically.
      12.6.1.4. Charges Preferred. Pending offenses from the Investigation module will be
      copied to the Charges Preferred folder. If an offense entered in Pending Offenses will not
      be preferred, delete that offense from Charges Preferred. If an offense will be added that
      was not in Pending Offenses, add the offense in the Charges Preferred module. Once an
      offense has been preferred, only AMJAMS Administrators can delete the preferral date
      and offense. After all applicable data is entered in the “Charges Preferred” module, print
      the Charge Sheet (DD Form 458) from AMJAMS.
         12.6.1.4.1. Accuser. Enter data on the accuser (individual causing charges to be
         preferred) and the officer that administered the oath.
      12.6.1.5. Special Offense Identifiers. Offenses requiring separate, individualized
      tracking have been assigned special offense identifiers. If the case involves offenses
      falling within the special offense category, please identify the offense by selecting the
      corresponding special offense identifier. A drop down list of potential identifiers is
      available for your convenience. Note: More than one special offense identifier may
      apply to each offense, i.e., 120-A, Rape, could use both “40” sex offender registration
      and “45” DNA processing required.
      12.6.1.6. Trial Personnel. Enter data pertaining to all trial participants in their respective
      categories (i.e., Defense Counsel, Trial Counsel, Court Reporter, etc.). Add as many
      participants as applicable, with the exception of the military judge. Use this tab first to
      reflect the military judge assigned to the case. If you need to add another military judge,
      add a separate JUDGE item. The Central Docketing Office (CDO) will complete the
      judge’s information. Do not delete personnel that participated in any part of the case if
      they are subsequently replaced or removed from the case. Ensure “current” is checked if
      the person is the current participant. Mark this block even if the participant is the only
      one in their category.
      12.6.1.7. Judge. This input is normally completed by the CDO.
      12.6.1.8. Article 32 Investigations. (General courts-martial only). If the accused waives
      the Article 32 hearing, annotate the date waived in this module. Enter the applicable
      dates of the Article 32 hearing from the date the Investigating Officer is appointed to the
      date the report was completed. If additional charges are later preferred and a second
      Article 32 is convened, add a separate Article 32 folder. In cases where an Article 32 is
      reopened, change the date completed on the original Article 32 folder.
         12.6.1.8.1. Referral Package. Enter the date the referral package was forwarded to
         the GCM SJA and the date the referral package was received by the GCM SJA. Enter

     be added in this folder. DO NOT attempt to add them to the original preferral. Ensure all
     fields are completed to include the specification text. Again, fill in accuser data as you
     would in the original preferral.
     12.6.1.14. SPCMCA Disposition. If the special court-martial convening authority
     dismisses or changes the forum of the case prior to referral, use this module to reflect the
     disposition. Contact AFLOA/JAS to change the forum of the case.
     12.6.1.15. GCMCA Disposition. If the general court-martial convening authority
     dismisses or changes the forum of the case prior to referral, use this module to reflect the
     disposition. Contact AFLOA/JAS to change the forum of the case.
     12.6.1.16. Charges Dropped. If charges are dropped after preferral, but before referral,
     use this module to clear them from the list. DO NOT delete them from the Charges

       delays approved by the convening authority prior to referral. Personnel enter delays
       approved by the military judge subsequent to referral. Indicate whether the delay days
       are excluded from the speedy trial rule.

Section 12E—Trial

12.7. Trial. All folders that apply to your case must be added as the event occurs (i.e., Article
39(a) Session, Trial Information, Adjudged Sentence), in the order that it occurs. Adding folders
out of sequence could affect some of the system logic and cause incorrect data to be displayed on
the AMJAMS reports.
   12.7.1. Article 39(a) Session. Record the arraignment 39(a) session convened in courts-
   martial. If motions occur during the arraignment session, there is no need to add an
   additional Article 39(a). These sessions are recorded and reflected as arraignment sessions.
   If the military judge has arraignment sessions and motions sessions that result in separate
   TDYs, add another Article 39(a) folder to reflect the separate sessions. (For SCM add the
   preliminary proceedings folder to indicate the date of arraignment.)
       12.7.1.1. Prior to Pleas. Motions to dismiss one or more offenses submitted prior to
       pleas should be reflected in this tab. If a motion is granted, annotate the event and reflect
       the date of the dismissal. Add the charges dismissed to this module by clicking the
       “View charges dropped” link and selecting the dismissed offenses from the list.
       12.7.1.2. Subsequent to Pleas. Motions submitted subsequent to pleas to dismiss or for a
       finding of not guilty for one or more offenses, or for a mistrial should be reflected on this
       tab. Charges withdrawn, dropped, or dismissed subsequent to pleas must be listed on the
       promulgating order. Therefore, you must completely annotate any of the above
       applicable actions on this tab. Enter the date the military judge granted the motion. Add
       the charges dismissed to this module by clicking the “View charges dismissed or finding
       of not guilty granted” link and selecting the dismissed offenses from the list. If the
       military judge declares a mistrial in the case after pleas, annotate the date in this section.
   12.7.2. Trial Information. Indicate whether the case is a single trial or joint trial, if any
   conditional pleas have been filed, and whether the accused elected to be tried by military
   judge alone, officers, or a panel with enlisted members.
       12.7.2.1. Conditional Pleas. With the approval of the military judge and the consent of
       the Government, an accused may enter a conditional plea of guilty, reserving the right, on
       further review or appeal, to review of the adverse determination of any specified pretrial
       motion. If the accused prevails on further review or appeal, the accused shall be allowed
       to withdraw the plea of guilty. (This is not to be confused with a PTA).
   12.7.3. Adjudged Sentence.
       12.7.3.1. Pleas and Findings. Enter pleas and adjudged findings in this section. Any
       charges dismissed or withdrawn subsequent to pleas will automatically be included in this

  and other high interest incidents involving personnel from “cradle to grave.” The authority
  for this system is DoD Directive 7730.47, 15 Oct 96 and its implementing guidance is DoD
  7730.47-M, Manual for Defense Incident-Based Reporting System. The system was designed

     administrative, offense, property, victim, offender/arrestee, commander’s action, results
     of trial, and corrections. SF and AFOSI are primarily responsible for the segments and,
     in most cases, will initiate the reporting process when they receive a credible report of a
     criminal incident. JA is only responsible for the “results of trial” segment. The data for
     this segment is gathered through the use of AMJAMS and most of it is already entered by
     a paralegal. There is also data that is required for VWAP reporting.

Staff Judge Advocates.” Use these titles for pretrial advice, post-trial recommendations and
court-martial orders. The Senior Assistant Staff Judge Advocate signs “Acting as the Staff Judge
Advocate” when the Staff Judge Advocate is absent or ineligible to act in a particular case. In all
other matters, titles such as “Deputy Staff Judge Advocate,” “Chief, Military Justice Division,”
and “Executive Officer,” may be used.
   13.1.1. Convening authorities may delegate military justice administrative duties to the Staff
   Judge Advocate (SJA) or any other attorney assigned to the servicing SJA’s office. Figure
   13.1 is a sample delegation letter. In addition to the duties listed in Figure 13.1, convening
   authorities may delegate any other military justice administrative duties not expressly
   requiring convening authority action. When signing a military justice matter for the
   convening authority, use the signature element, “FOR THE COMMANDER.”

13.3. AFLOA/JAJM Requests for Information.
   13.3.1. In General. AFLOA/JAJM routinely receives inquiries concerning military justice
   actions against Air Force members and relies heavily on information from bases to answer
   the inquiries. A complete, accurate and timely response to requests for information is
   critical. Do not construe requests as criticism of case handling, nor view them as a mandate
   for particular action. AFLOA/JAJM may communicate directly with any organizational
   level. When providing information, send informational copies of replies to intermediate
   levels of command and through MAJCOM level to AFLOA/JAJM to ensure all are informed.

   the AF Form 3070, Record of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings); and discharge action
   contemplated, if any.
   13.3.5. Responses Regarding Civilian Charges. In addition to matters in paragraph 13.3.2,
   provide the following as appropriate:
       13.3.5.1. Jurisdiction involved (if in a foreign jurisdiction, indicate whether a waiver of
       jurisdiction has been requested).
       13.3.5.2. Charges;

with Congress, Chapter 3, provides additional guidance.
 242                                                                  AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


Section 13D—Extrajudicial Statements to the Public Relating to Criminal Proceedings and
Release of Court-Martial Records

13.5. General. Information may not be disseminated if it could reasonably be expected to
interfere with law enforcement proceedings or deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an
impartial adjudication in a criminal proceeding. The determination of whether a release is
permissible includes an assessment of the type and details of information to be released and its
source, the type of proceeding, and the stage of the proceeding. The release of information
relating to a criminal proceeding is subject to the Air Force Rules of Professional Conduct, the
Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice, implementing directives, security requirements,
judicial orders protecting information, and applicable laws such as the Privacy Act, the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA), and the Victim and Witness Protection Act. See paragraph 13.6.1.1
with respect to the FOIA’s balancing test concerning the privacy rights of an accused.
   13.5.1. Air Force representatives must not encourage or assist news media in photographing
   or televising an accused being held or transported in custody.
   13.5.2. This section does not apply to the release of information by military or civilian
   defense counsel. However, defense counsel, both military and civilian, must comply with the
   Air Force Rules of Professional Conduct and the Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice,
   portions of which address trial publicity by defense counsel. Military defense counsel must
   comply with the requirements and restrictions of the FOIA and the Privacy Act with respect
   to the release of Air Force records.
13.6. Extrajudicial Statements. Extrajudicial statements are oral or written statements made
outside of a criminal proceeding that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by
means of public communication. There are valid reasons for making certain information
available to the public in the form of extrajudicial statements, when such release otherwise
complies with applicable rules and regulations as described in paragraph 13.5. However,
extrajudicial statements should not be used for the purpose of influencing the course of a
criminal proceeding. Usually, extrajudicial statements should include only factual matters and
should not offer subjective observations or opinions. The question of whether a statement is
extrajudicial will depend upon the circumstances.
   13.6.1. Under the Privacy Act, information from a system of records, such as a court-martial
   file maintained in a JA office about an individual, may not be released to the public without
   the individual’s consent unless release is required by the FOIA. FOIA requires release
   except when specified circumstances exist, one of which is when release would constitute an
   unwarranted invasion of an individual’s personal privacy. (See 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b) and 5
   U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) & 552(b)(7)(C).)
       13.6.1.1. An unwarranted invasion of personal privacy exists when an individual’s
       privacy interests outweigh the public’s interest in disclosure of the information. See
       Chang v. Dep’t of the Navy, 314 F. Supp. 2d 35 (D.D.C. 2004); Schmidt v. Dep’t of the
       Air Force, 2007 WL 2812148 (C.D. Ill 2007). The public’s interest portion of the
       balancing test is defined as the degree to which disclosure sheds light on the performance
       of an agency’s statutory function. Dep’t of Justice v. Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. 749,
       773 (1989). This can include information about how the government holds its employees
       accountable. See Schmidt at 11.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                        243


     13.6.1.2. Whether disclosure of data regarding the accused and his alleged offenses
     constitutes an unwarranted invasion of privacy depends upon the assessment of whether
     the accused has a reasonable expectation of privacy as measured by various factors,
     including, but not limited to, the accused’s rank, duties, alleged offense(s), existing
     publicity about the allegation(s), and stage of the proceedings. Considering the fact that
     anyone subject to the UCMJ can act as an accuser under the UCMJ, the accused normally
     retains a reasonable expectation of privacy upon preferral of charges. When the
     convening authority directs the charges toward a public forum, such as an Article 32
     hearing or referral to trial, the accused’s reasonable expectation of privacy begins to
     decline.
  13.6.2. Extrajudicial Statements That Generally May Be Made Only After Disposition
  Decision by the Convening Authority (CA) Directing an Article 32 Investigation or Directing
  Referral. Following the FOIA balancing test above, the following information may normally
  be provided after a CA has disposed of preferred charges by directing an Article 32
  investigation or has referred the charges to a court-martial (exceptional cases may warrant
  earlier release but only after applying a public interest balancing test; assessing the
  reasonable expectation of privacy factors; and exercising due caution):
     13.6.2.1. The accused’s name, unit and assignment;
     13.6.2.2. The substance or text of charges and specifications, provided there is a
     statement included explaining that the charges are merely accusations and that the
     accused is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty. As necessary, redact all
     Victim and Witness Protection Act and Privacy Act protected data from the charges and
     specifications (such as the names of all victims, signature of the accuser, and SSN of the
     accused).
     13.6.2.3. The scheduling or result of any stage in the judicial process;
     13.6.2.4. Date and place of trial and other proceedings, or anticipated dates, if known;
     13.6.2.5. Identity and qualifications of appointed counsel;
     13.6.2.6. Identities of convening and reviewing authorities;
     13.6.2.7. A statement, without comment, that the accused has no prior criminal or
     disciplinary record or that the accused denies the charges; and
     13.6.2.8. The identity of the victim where the release of that information is not otherwise
     prohibited by law. Generally, however, do not release the names of victims of sex
     offenses, the names of children or the identity of any victim when release would be
     contrary to the desire of the victim or harmful to the victim.
  13.6.3. Disclosing the Identities of Court Members and the Military Judge. Do not volunteer
  the identities of the court members or the military judge in material prepared for publication.
  This information may normally be released, if requested, after the court members or the
  military judge have been identified in the court-martial proceeding and the SJA to the
  convening authority determines release would not prejudice the accused’s rights or violate
  the member’s or the military judge’s privacy interests.
  13.6.4. Requests for Information from Law Enforcement Agencies: Disclose data about the
  accused, the charges, and the evidence in accordance with Blanket Routine Uses and System
244                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


  of Records Notice (SORN) Routine Uses concerning military justice records. See
  http://dpclo.defense.gov/privacy/SORNs/component/airforce/index.html; F051 AFJA I,
  Military Justice and Magistrate Court Records.
  13.6.5. A written or oral request for information from the media or public is not required
  prior to release, nor does a media request indicate that information is automatically
  releasable.
  13.6.6. Extrajudicial Statements That May Be Made Under Some Circumstances Regardless
  of the Stage of the Proceedings. The following extrajudicial statements may be made when
  deemed necessary regardless of the stage of the proceeding:
      13.6.6.1. General information to educate or inform the public concerning military law
      and the military justice system;
      13.6.6.2. If the accused is a fugitive, information necessary to aid in apprehending the
      accused or to warn the public of possible dangers;
      13.6.6.3. Requests for assistance in obtaining evidence and information necessary to
      obtain evidence;
      13.6.6.4. When requested or otherwise in the best interest of the Air Force, after applying
      FOIA exemption principles, as appropriate: facts and circumstances of an accused’s
      apprehension, including the time and place of apprehension;
      13.6.6.5. The identities of investigating and apprehending agencies, and the length of the
      investigation, only if release of this information will not impede an ongoing or future
      investigation, and the release is coordinated with the affected agencies;
      13.6.6.6. Information contained in a public record, without further comment; and
      13.6.6.7. Information that protects the military justice system from matters that have a
      substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing the proceedings. Information in the form
      of extrajudicial statements shall be subject to paragraph 13.6.1 and limited to that which
      is necessary to correct misinformation or to mitigate the substantial undue prejudicial
      effect of information or publicity already available to the public. This can include, but is
      not limited to, information that would have been available to a spectator at an open
      Article 32 investigation or an open session of a court-martial. Unless The Judge
      Advocate General (TJAG) has withheld the authority to coordinate on command release
      of this information for individual cases or types of cases, the MAJCOM SJA (or
      equivalent) shall coordinate on release of this information by the appropriate command
      authority. If TJAG has withheld the authority to coordinate on release of extrajudicial
      statements, requests for TJAG coordination shall be forwarded through the MAJCOM
      SJA to AFLOA/JAJM by the most expeditious means appropriate to the sensitivity of the
      information.
 13.6.7. Extrajudicial Statements Which Generally May Not Be Made. Extrajudicial
 statements relating to the following matters ordinarily have a substantial likelihood of
 prejudicing a criminal proceeding and generally should not be made:
      13.6.7.1. The existence or contents of any confession, admission or statement by the
      accused or the accused’s refusal or failure to make a statement;
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          245


       13.6.7.2. Observations about the accused’s character and reputation;
       13.6.7.3. Opinions regarding the accused’s guilt or innocence;
       13.6.7.4. Opinions regarding the merits of the case or the merits of the evidence;
       13.6.7.5. References to the performance of any examinations, tests or investigative
       procedures (e.g., fingerprints, polygraph examinations, and ballistics or laboratory tests),
       the accused’s failure to submit to an examination or test, or the identity or nature of
       physical evidence expected to be presented;
       13.6.7.6. Statements concerning the identity, expected testimony, disciplinary or criminal
       records, or credibility of prospective witnesses;
       13.6.7.7. The possibility of a guilty plea or other disposition of the case other than
       procedural information concerning such processes;
       13.6.7.8. Before sentencing, facts regarding the accused’s disciplinary or criminal
       record, including nonjudicial punishment, prior court-martial convictions, and other
       arrests, indictments, convictions, or charges. Generally, do not release information about
       nonjudicial punishment or administrative actions even after sentencing unless admitted
       into evidence. This rule does not prohibit, however, a statement that the accused has no
       prior criminal or disciplinary record; and
       13.6.7.9. Information that trial counsel knows or has reason to know would be
       inadmissible as evidence in a trial.
   13.6.8. Responsibility for Extrajudicial Statements. The release of extrajudicial statements
   is a command responsibility. The convening authority responsible for the criminal
   proceeding makes the ultimate decision about release of extrajudicial statements relating to
   that criminal proceeding. MAJCOM (or equivalent) commanders may withhold release
   authority from subordinate commanders
       13.6.8.1. The installation SJA and the installation public affairs officer (PAO) must work
       closely together to provide informed advice to the commander. SJAs should consult with
       their MAJCOM SJAs when there is a question about the nature of a statement proposed
       for release. If the extrajudicial statement is based on information contained in agency
       records, the OPR for the record should also coordinate on the extrajudicial statement
       prior to release. In high interest cases, the SJA and the PAO should consult with their
       MAJCOM representatives, and AFLOA/JAJM and AFLOA/JAA as necessary.
       13.6.8.2. The SJA, trial counsel and defense counsel must ensure investigators, law
       enforcement personnel, employees and other persons assisting or associated with the
       respective counsel do not make extrajudicial statements counsel are prohibited from
       making.
13.7. Release of Information from Records of Trial or Related Records: Once a completed
record is forwarded, AFLOA/JAJM is the disclosure authority for all records and associated
documents. This subsection does not apply to documents or records that originate outside the
military justice system of records (e.g., AFOSI reports). The disclosure authority for such
documents and records is the OPR for those records under the provisions of the, AFI 33-332,
Privacy Act Program, and/or DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302, DoD Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) Program.
 246                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   13.7.1. Release of Court-Martial Record of Trial. RCM 1103(b)(2) defines a court-martial
   record of trial. The court-martial record of trial is subject to release determination under the
   Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act. Information marked as classified, controlled,
   or sealed by judicial order should not be released absent an authoritative determination of
   releasability. A transcript of oral proceedings is not a record until authentication. When
   releasing records of trial under this paragraph, redact all Victim and Witness Protection Act
   and Privacy Act protected data, to include the names of victims of sex offenses, the names of
   children (under the age of 18), and the identity of victims who could be harmed by disclosure
   of their identity.
   13.7.2. Release of Other Military Justice Documents or Records. All other documents or
   records, including documents which will become part of a record of trial, and including those
   which are attached to the court-martial record of trial but not made a part of the record of trial
   under the provisions of RCM 1103 (for example, an Article 32 report and its attachments) are
   also subject to release determination under the Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act.
   However, due regard will be given to the potentially heightened privacy interests of an
   accused where a case has not been fully adjudicated as well as to whether any exemption,
   such as those included to protect ongoing deliberative processes or investigative processes
   should be invoked. Information marked as classified, controlled, or sealed by judicial order
   should not be released absent an authoritative determination of releasability. When releasing
   military justice documents or records under this paragraph, redact all Victim and Witness
   Protection Act and Privacy Act protected data, to include the names of victims of sex
   offenses, the names of children, and the identity of victims who could be harmed by
   disclosure of their identity.
   13.7.3. Cases Disposed of by Acquittal or Action Other Than Court-Martial. When the
   charges against an accused were disposed of by an action other than court-martial, or when a
   court-martial results in an acquittal, due consideration must be given to the likelihood that the
   accused may have increased privacy interests in the protection of information contained in
   military justice documents or records. Less serious misconduct, which is handled
   administratively rather than judicially, generally is not considered of sufficient public interest
   to outweigh the privacy interest of the individual.

Section 13E—Special Interest Reports (SIRs)

13.8. Reporting Special Interest Cases to HQ USAF. Certain offenses committed by Air
Force members generate requests for information within HQ USAF, regardless of the member’s
grade or disposition by military or civilian authorities. Similarly, an accused’s grade itself may
generate requests for information, or necessitate HQ USAF knowledge of an alleged offense.
SJAs must be sensitive to reporting requirements in this chapter, and make complete and timely
reports. Reporting Special Interest cases is a base level responsibility. Reports should be
prepared and forwarded within 24 hours of learning of the incident to AFLOA/JAJM by the base
legal office prosecuting the case or, if the case is in a civilian court, the base legal office
servicing the unit where the accused is assigned. None of the reporting requirements are
intended to preclude a commander’s complete evaluation of a case before deciding what action,
if any, to take.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                        247


  13.8.1. Officer, Cadet, CMSgt and SMSgt Cases. Regardless of offense, report all
  investigations into allegations involving officers, cadets, CMSgts, and SMSgts.
  13.8.2. Serious Crimes. Regardless of grade, report cases involving the following crimes,
  including attempts, conspiracies, and solicitations to commit these crimes:
     13.8.2.1. homicide;
     13.8.2.2. sexual assault;
     13.8.2.3. espionage, subversion, aiding the enemy, sabotage, spying, or violations of
     punitive regulations or statutes regarding the handling of classified information or the
     foreign relations of the United States;
     13.8.2.4. environmental crimes, including civilian felony prosecution;
     13.8.2.5. fraternization and unprofessional relationships; and
     13.8.2.6. anthrax or smallpox refusals.
  13.8.3. Cases with Command or Media Interest.
     13.8.3.1. Report any case where the local chain-of-command for the accused or subject
     would likely provide information about the case to the MAJCOM commander and/or
     Headquarters Air Force (HAF). SJAs should also work with their respective command
     post to ensure they are made aware of criminal activity and other legal-related events or
     incidents reported to higher headquarters via OPREP3 as provided for in AFI 10-206,
     Operational Reporting.
     13.8.3.2. Report any other case with potential community reaction, or potential or actual
     media coverage.
  13.8.4. Report Format. Use the Special Interest Report in AMJAMS to generate reports.
  Ensure the initial report includes a detailed summary of the case by filling in all AMJAMS
  data fields. Include a thorough description of offenses, dates, UCMJ articles allegedly
  violated, the number of specifications under each offense, sufficient detail to provide senior
  leadership with a clear understanding of the facts and circumstances involved, whether media
  attention is anticipated, and any other unusual or significant features of the case. Identify
  incomplete facts in the report and follow-up as soon as possible.
     13.8.4.1. Ensure sensitive investigative information is not included in the SIR without
     concurrence of the AFOSI Detachment Commander/Special Agent-in-Charge (SAC) or
     other investigating agency. See paragraph 13.31 for examples of sensitive investigative
     information.
     13.8.4.2. For matters investigated by commander-directed investigation (CDI), IG or
     MEO, summarize the allegations, and when final, identify both substantiated and
     unsubstantiated findings.
     13.8.4.3. For cases disposed of by NJP or administrative action (e.g. LOR or LOC),
     identify the wrongdoing or offenses alleged (e.g. “On (date), Subject served NJP/LOR
     for…”).
     13.8.4.4. For cases disposed of by civilian authorities, include information that identifies
     the court and jurisdiction and summarize the charges, pleas, findings and sentence.
 248                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


       13.8.4.5. If a matter was disposed of without action, explain why.
       13.8.4.6. With sexual assault cases, make sure to put whether or not an STC was
       consulted under the “Pending Offense” subfolder, “Case Information” tab.
   13.8.5. When to Report. Submit reports:
       13.8.5.1. Within 24 hours after learning of an incident in any of the above-mentioned
       categories;
       13.8.5.2. When a significant event in a reported case occurs after initial reporting.
       Significant events include disposition of investigation, when jurisdiction is obtained from
       civilian authorities, preferral of charges, trial, results of trial, Convening Authority action,
       date Article 15 offered, date Article 15 punishment imposed, and media interest;
       13.8.5.3. Continue to submit reports until completion of administrative or disciplinary
       action, to include the decision whether to file the action in an OSR, or as directed by AF,
       MAJCOM or NAF legal offices. Exception: in officer cases involving involuntary
       separation, continue to report until completion of discharge processing.
   13.8.6. When updating or reporting initial SIRs in accordance with triggering events listed in
   the previous paragraph, use the following format for the e-mail subject line as appropriate:
   (FOUO) NEW SIR: CASE ID # - RANK SURNAME – BASE; (FOUO) UPATED SIR:
   CASE ID # - RANK SURNAME – BASE.
       13.8.6.1. All current event updates to a SIR should be completed no later than the 25th of
       each month.
   13.8.7. AMJAMS Process. All special interest reporting should be accomplished via
   AMJAMS using the reports located on the AMJAMS reports page. Reporting special interest
   cases is a base responsibility. Updates should be made after every significant event until
   final disposition (e.g., Article 15, administrative action, preferral, Article 32, referral).
       13.8.7.1. SAF and NAF/MAJCOM SIR buttons are located in the Special Interest Folder
       of AMJAMS. Click the “Special Interest reporting required” button for all cases listed in
       the paragraphs 13.8.1 to 13.8.4. The “NAF/MAJCOM SIR” button is selected when a
       NAF/MAJCOM requires additional reporting not required by this AFI and the
       information is for use by each individual NAF and MAJCOM.
       13.8.7.2. Transmitting SIRs to AFLOA/JAJM. In addition to the requirement in
       paragraph 13.8.4, updates are made in AMJAMS by going to the AMJAMS Reports page
       on the web and selecting Special Interest Report. Next, put in the case ID and select case
       notes and run the report. Save a “pdf” copy of the SIR and send it to AFLOA/JAJM via
       e-mail to JAJM.SIR@pentagon.af.mil.

Section 13F—Reporting Referral of Additional Charges in Cases Pending Review

13.9. Reporting Referral of Additional Charges in Cases Pending Review. If a case is
pending review under Articles 66, 67 or 69, UCMJ, the headquarters referring new charges must
notify AFLOA/JAJM of the facts relating to the new charges.

Section 13G—Reporting Foreign National USAF Member Cases
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         249


13.10. Foreign National USAF Member. A foreign national USAF member is a member of
the USAF who is a national of a foreign country and who is not a citizen or national of the
United States. For purposes of this section, any USAF member who claims to be a foreign
national shall be considered so.
   13.10.1. Notification. Notify HQ USAF/JAO when a foreign national USAF member is:
      13.10.1.1. Apprehended under circumstances likely to result in confinement or trial by
      court-martial and states that he/she is a foreign national;
      13.10.1.2. Ordered into arrest or confinement;
      13.10.1.3. Held for trial with or without any form of restraint; or
      13.10.1.4. Pending court-martial charges which have been referred for trial.
   13.10.2. The notification shall include:
      13.10.2.1. The name, grade, SSN, organization and station of the foreign national USAF
      member;
      13.10.2.2. Any evidence, including information from the member’s military record,
      which is inconsistent with a claim of foreign nationality;
      13.10.2.3. A thorough description of offenses, including dates, UCMJ articles allegedly
      violated, the number of specifications under each offense, and sufficient detail to provide
      clear understanding of the facts and circumstances involved, and any other unusual or
      significant features of the case;
      13.10.2.4. The name of the military and/or civilian defense counsel, if any; and
      13.10.2.5. The exact location of the foreign national USAF member (e.g., JB Andrews
      confinement facility).
   13.10.3. Whenever charges against a foreign national USAF member are referred for trial,
   the SJA of the SPCMCA shall have the member’s military records examined to ascertain the
   member’s nationality even if that member has not entered a claim of foreign nationality.
   13.10.4. Notification is not required:
      13.10.4.1. When disciplinary action under Article 15, UCMJ, or administrative action is
      taken; or
      13.10.4.2. If the foreign national USAF member is apprehended or confined in
      anticipation that only such actions will be taken.
   13.10.5. The section does not apply when a foreign national is charged with a crime,
   arrested, confined or detained in custody by the civil authorities of the United States, or any
   political subdivision, possession or territory thereof, or by the authorities of any foreign
   government. AFJI 51-707, Consular Protection of Foreign National Subject to the Uniform
   Code of Military Justice.

Section 13H—Time Management of Case Processing

13.11. Case Processing Time.
250                                                                  AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


  13.11.1. In General. SJAs must give managerial attention to all time standards prescribed by
  the MCM, statutes, case law and regulations.
  13.11.2. Coordination with AFOSI. SJAs should develop local procedures with their
  servicing AFOSI detachment commander to coordinate with agents as early as possible in the
  investigative stages of a case.
  13.11.3. Time Management. Expeditious processing of courts-martial is essential to
  minimize disruptions in the Air Force mission, the lives of victims, witnesses, and the
  accused, and to minimize Air Force costs. The impartial and timely administration of
  military justice helps sustain good order and discipline. SJAs and chiefs of military justice,
  at all levels of command, should regularly analyze available AMJAMS data relating to each
  segment of court processing over which they have significant control to determine specific
  areas for improvement and implement appropriate management measures to maximize
  effectiveness and efficiency. The following Air Force court-martial metrics are established
  to assist in expediting the administration of justice.
      13.11.3.1. Prefer charges in 80% of all general and special courts-martial within 30 days
      of the date the AFOSI, SFOI, or CDI Report of Investigation (ROI) is published.
      NOTE: Charges may always be preferred prior to the publication of the ROI. If charges
      are preferred prior to the publication of the ROI, AMJAMS should reflect “0” days
      between publication of the ROI and preferral.
      13.11.3.2. Convene 80% of all courts-martial (arraignment) on a Docketed Trial Date
      within 45 days after the accused is served (RCM 602).
      13.11.3.3. Complete 80% of all GCM (Preferral Date - CA Action Date) within 160
      days.
      13.11.3.4. Complete 80% of all SPCM (Preferral Date - CA Action Date) within 75 days.
      13.11.3.5. Complete 80% of all SCM (Date of Discovery - CA Action Date) within 60
      days.
      13.11.3.6. Forward all court-martial ROTs to AFLOA/JAJM within 14 days of CA
      action.
      13.11.3.7. Complete 80% of all Article 66, UCMJ, appellate reviews within 270 days
      (Date AFLOA/JAJM receives the ROT - Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals Decision
      Date).
      13.11.3.8. SJAs are expected to enable expeditious processing of all cases by closely
      monitoring activities and providing legal guidance to investigative agencies from the date
      of discovery of the offense through preferral. Early and regular SJA assistance to
      investigative agencies is essential in helping to foster efficient processes while ensuring
      sufficient investigative results and ROIs. In cases in which an ROI is published, the
      following measures have been established for purposes of calculating the date of
      discovery to convening authority action. In general courts-martial, the measure for
      completing the ROI is within 75 days of the date of discovery of the offense. In special
      courts-martial, the measure is for completing the ROI within 30 days of the date of
      discovery of the offense. These are internal JAGC measures to assist in the efficient and
      expeditious investigation of cases.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         251


      13.11.3.9. The following measures have been established to assist in expediting the
      administration of justice. In GCMs, CA Action should be completed within 265 days of
      the date of discovery of the offense. In SPCMs, CA Action should be completed within
      135 days of the date of discovery of the offense.
      13.11.3.10. The date of discovery of the offense is defined as the date when an
      investigative agency (e.g., AFOSI, SFOI, IG), legal office, commander, supervisor, or
      first sergeant becomes aware of an allegation and a subject has been identified, including
      when notification is made by civilian authorities. In a case involving a CDI, the date of
      discovery of the offense is when a commander is notified of an allegation that an offense
      has been committed and a subject has been identified. If an allegation is investigated by
      CDI and is subsequently turned over to an investigative agency for further investigation,
      use the date the commander first became aware of the allegation and initiated the CDI. In
      all cases where additional allegations against an identified subject are discovered, use the
      earliest date of discovery of all offenses.

Section 13I—Status of Discipline

13.12. Status of Discipline Meetings. Status of Discipline (SOD) meetings, run by the wing
commander or equivalent authority, shall be conducted on at least a quarterly basis.
   13.12.1. The SJA will facilitate SOD meetings and invite the following personnel to
   participate at the meetings: group commanders, squadron commanders, and first sergeants.
   Other legal office staff will attend SOD meetings at the direction of the SJA.
   13.12.2. On all closed cases, the following items must be discussed at SOD meetings:
      13.12.2.1. Court-martial processing times from discovery of offense to CA action for all
      squadrons.
      13.12.2.2. NJP processing times from discovery of offense to SJA legal review for all
      squadrons.
      13.12.2.3. The average NJP processing time from discovery of offense to SJA legal
      review for each squadron (including tenant squadrons) for the current calendar year.
   13.12.3. On all closed cases, the following items may be discussed at SOD meetings (this is
   not an exhaustive list):
      13.12.3.1. Type of offense(s) and demographic data on individuals who were court-
      martialed. Do not disclose individuals’ names.
      13.12.3.2. Type of offense(s) and demographic data on individuals who received NJP.
      Do not disclose individuals’ names.
      13.12.3.3. Number of driving under the influence incidents and whether the incidents
      occurred on-base or off-base. Do not disclose individuals’ names.
      13.12.3.4. Special interest items as identified by the wing commander or equivalent
      authority or the SJA.

Section 13J—Specific Search, Seizure, and Apprehension Matters
 252                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


13.13. Authorization to Administer Oaths for Search, Seizure, and Apprehension. Air
Force commanders and military magistrates are authorized to administer oaths or affirmations for
purposes of authorizing searches, seizures, and apprehensions based upon probable cause. Use
the AF Form 3226, Authority to Apprehend in Private Dwelling, to document authorization to
apprehend someone from a private dwelling. When required by the circumstances of a particular
case, oral authorization may be given.
13.14. U.S. Mail and Government Information Systems.
   13.14.1. U. S. Mail. Refer to DoD 4525.6-M, Department of Defense Postal Manual,
   paragraph C10.7, for procedures for the inspection, search, and seizure of mail in the custody
   of the military postal service. The U.S. Postal Service operates post offices on CONUS
   installations and opening of mail is allowed only pursuant to a valid search warrant executed
   by a federal magistrate or judge.
   13.14.2. Government Information Systems. Government information systems are subject to
   monitoring, interception, search, and seizure for all authorized purposes in accordance with
   the DoD Consent Banner placed on government computer systems.
       13.14.2.1. The DoD Consent Banner does not extend to include the content of privileged
       communications or work product related to personal representation or services by
       attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, to include their assistants. Users should annotate
       their privileged communications in e-mails and documents to ensure such information is
       kept confidential and not inappropriately accessed or read during authorized search,
       seizure, interception, or monitoring activities. Investigators should consult with the
       appropriate legal office or AFOSI/JA prior to and during such activities to ensure
       privileged communications are appropriately protected and remain confidential.
       13.14.2.2. Under normal circumstances, a person does not have a reasonable expectation
       of privacy in government property that is not issued for personal use. M.R.E. 314(d).
       Furthermore, the presence of the DoD Consent Banner and/or subject's user agreement is
       evidence of implied consent to monitoring on the government information system.
       United States v. Larson, 66 M.J. 212, 216 (C.A.A.F. 2008). See also United States v.
       Milian-Rodriguez, 759 F.2d 1558, 1563-64 (11th Cir. 1985). Implied consent exists
       when circumstances indicate a party to a communication was "in fact aware" of
       monitoring and nevertheless proceeded to use the system. See United States v. Workman,
       80 F.3d 688 (2d Cir. 1996). Government employees may waive some of their Fourth
       Amendment rights pursuant to the conditions of employment. See, e.g., United States v.
       Simons, 206 F.3d 392, 398 (4th Cir. 2000) (government employee had no reasonable
       expectation of privacy in computer in light of computer use policy); American Postal
       Workers Union, Columbus Area Local AFL-CIO v. United States Postal Service, 871
       F.2d 556, 559-61 (6th Cir. 1989) (postal employees retained no reasonable expectation of
       privacy in government lockers after signing waivers). Only if the totality of the facts and
       circumstances indicate that the subject has a reasonable expectation of privacy (for
       example, no DOD banner in place, no user agreement, or local policy inadvertently
       creates an expectation of privacy) is obtaining a search authorization warranted.
13.15. Military Defense Counsel. If a search authorization is to be issued against an ADC or
SDC, or his/her house or office, precautions must be taken to protect the confidentiality of
attorney-client materials to the maximum extent possible. Obtaining a search authorization
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         253


against defense personnel or their quarters, property, or offices, is an action warranting special
consideration and guidance. A search authorization against defense personnel should only be
pursued when there is no other feasible alternative for securing critical evidence.
   13.15.1. SJAs will inform the commander, Air Force Legal Operations Agency
   (AFLOA/CC), or the Director, USAF Judiciary (AFLOA/JAJ), before such search
   authorizations are executed or as soon as practicable if exigent circumstances exist.
   13.15.2. If a search authorization is not required due to exigent circumstances IAW MRE
   315(g), notify AFLOA/CC or AFLOA/JAJ of the search as soon as practicable.
   13.15.3. The purpose of this notification is to provide information—not to seek assistance in
   obtaining or authorizing a search or other process against defense personnel. If a search
   authorization is granted, its execution should be planned to minimize disruption to the
   operation of the defense office and should occur at a time when defense clients are unlikely
   to be present.
   13.15.4. If this situation arises, review United States v. Calhoun, 49 M.J. 485 (1998), where
   a base SJA contacted AFLOA/CC and discussed searching an ADC office. In upholding the
   case, the court found that AFLOA/CC's role was limited to being informed of the search and
   discussing it with the SJA, not in seeking or authorizing it. The court further found the Air
   Force took extraordinary precautions to ensure that only independent personnel would be
   involved in the search and subsequent review of materials seized. These precautions
   included: (1) having an investigator from another base, assisted by a reserve judge advocate,
   conduct the search; (2) ordering the searchers not to disclose the matter with anyone else and
   to seal any evidence recovered; and (3) having a reserve military judge review papers seized
   to determine what material was responsive to the warrant and how to handle other seized
   material.

Section 13K—Appointment of Judges to the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals

13.16. Appointing Judges to AFCCA. Pursuant to Article 66, UCMJ, TJAG appoints judge
advocates to the AFCCA.

Section 13L—Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration under
Federal Law

13.17. General Provision. If the member has been convicted of a sexually violent offense or
certain offenses against a minor, the Air Force is required to provide notice to state and local
officials prior to the member’s release from confinement, and the member may be required to
register as a sex offender under state law. See the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children
and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act (1994); Pub. L. 105-119, Title I, §
115(a)(8(C)(i), 111 Stat. 2466 (1997);Megan’s Law (1996); the Final Guidelines for the Jacob
Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act and
Megan’s Law (1998); Pam Lyncher Sex Offender Tracking and Identification Act (1996); Jacob
Wetterling Improvements Act (1997); Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act (1998);
and, Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (2006). The Acts are available at the United
States Department of Justice (DOJ) website http://www.ojp.usDoJ.gov/smart/legislation.htm.
 254                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


13.18. Compliance With Federal/State Laws. The Security Forces (SF) corrections officer, or
designee at the facility in which the prisoner is detained ensures compliance with federal/state
laws. See AFI 31-205, The Air Force Corrections System. This includes the corrections officer
notifying appropriate state and local law enforcement officials and state sex offender registration
officials using the DD Form 2791, Notice of Release/Acknowledgement of Convicted Sex
Offender Registration Requirements. It also includes the corrections officer notifying the
member about his or her registration responsibilities and obtaining the member’s
acknowledgment of these responsibilities.
13.19. Base-Level SJA Responsibilities. If a member is convicted of an offense that triggers
the notification requirement, indicate on the Report of Result of Trial, that compliance with this
section is required. A determination that a member committed a qualifying offense has important
consequences. Figure 13.3 is a list of offenses which trigger sex offender notification
requirements. It should be noted, however, that sex offender registration requirements vary by
state and may be triggered by offenses not listed in Figure 13.3. Therefore, a member convicted
of an offense that does not trigger sex offender notification requirements may nonetheless be
required to register as a sex offender under state law. When a question arises whether a
conviction triggers notification requirements, SJAs should seek guidance from a superior
command level legal office. Further questions about whether an offense triggers notification
requirements may be directed to AFLOA/JAJM.
   13.19.1. No Post-trial Confinement. When compliance with Section 13L is required, but
   confinement is not part of the adjudged punishment (or sufficient pretrial or illegal pretrial
   confinement credit completely offsets the term of confinement imposed at trial), the SJA will
   notify the appropriate corrections officer (or the Security Forces commander, if there is no
   corrections officer), in writing, within 24 hours of the member’s conviction. For purposes of
   this section, conviction includes announcement of the sentence. The corrections officer, or
   the Security Forces commander, as appropriate, will ensure that the notifications required in
   paragraph 13.17 and AFI 31-205 are made.
   13.19.2. Convictions by a Host Country. Service members, military dependents, DoD
   Contractors, and DoD Civilians can be convicted of a sex offense outside normal DoD
   channels by the host nation while assigned overseas. When compliance with Section 13L is
   required of the aforementioned individuals, the SJA will notify the appropriate individuals.
   It is the SJA’s responsibility to ensure the individual completes the DD Form 2791 (or
   equivalent document) upon release from the host nation. Furthermore, the DD Form 2791
   and copies of the ROT should be provided to federal, state, and local law enforcement by the
   DoD.

Section 13M—Compliance with DNA Collection under Federal Law

13.20. General Provision. DNA collection is required when: a person subject to the UCMJ has
been apprehended for an offense which makes DNA collection mandatory; fingerprints are taken
in connection with an investigation for offenses listed in DoDI 5505.11, Fingerprint Card and
Final Disposition Report Submission Requirements, and where the investigator concludes there
is probable cause that the subject committed the offense; charges are preferred; after completion
of the 72-hour commander’s memorandum approving continued pretrial confinement; and upon
an accused’s entry into confinement as a result of a general or special court-martial conviction.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         255


IAW DoD Instruction 5505.14, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Collection Requirements for
Criminal Investigations, Enclosure 3, the military criminal investigator must consult with a judge
advocate prior to making a probable cause determination. Note: collection of a DNA sample is
not required if a DNA sample has already been collected and submitted to the USACIL.
13.21. Base-Level SJA Responsibilities. Base-level SJAs will brief their commanders about
the new DNA processing requirements. DNA collection is mandatory under the following
circumstances.
   13.21.1. Pretrial confinement.       If a 72-hour commander’s memorandum (RCM
   305(h)(2)(C)) has approved continued pretrial confinement (whether or not charges have
   been preferred) and a DNA sample has not already been collected from the accused and
   submitted to the USACIL, the SJA uses Figure 13.2 (Notification of DNA Processing
   Responsibilities) to notify immediate commanders about their responsibilities.
   13.21.2. Preferral. If charges are preferred and a DNA sample has not already been
   collected from the accused and submitted to the USACIL, the SJA uses Figure 13.2
   (Notification of DNA Processing Responsibilities) to notify immediate commanders about
   their responsibilities.
   13.21.3. Conviction. If an accused is convicted of any offense at a general or special court-
   martial, indicate “DNA PROCESSING REQUIRED” in the SENTENCE block of the Report
   of Result of Trial memorandum.
       13.21.3.1. SJAs must ensure promulgating orders prepared for individuals convicted of
       an offense contain the annotation “DNA Processing Required. 10 U.S.C. § 1565 and 42
       U.S.C. § 14135a.” in 14-point boldface type on the first page of the order. The
       annotation must be one line, centered, and one inch from the top of the page. If a DNA
       sample has not already been collected from the accused and submitted to the USACIL, or
       the adjudged confinement, if any, would not allow sufficient time to collect a DNA
       sample, the SJA uses Figure 13.2 (Notification of DNA Processing Responsibilities) to
       notify immediate commanders about their responsibilities.
   13.21.4. Other Disposition. When a court-martial results in an acquittal of all charged
   offenses, or findings of guilty are disapproved or set aside, or the case is disposed of by
   referral to summary court-martial, Article 15, or administrative action, the SJA will advise
   commanders and military criminal investigators whether expungement is authorized, if a
   member submits a request for expungement.

Section 13N—Compliance with the Domestic Violence Amendment to the Gun Control Act of
1968 (known as “The Lautenberg Amendment”)

13.22. General Provision. The Lautenberg Amendment makes it a felony for any person to sell
or otherwise dispose of firearms or ammunition to any person whom he or she knows or has
reasonable cause to believe has been convicted of a “misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.”
Additionally, persons convicted of such crimes are also prohibited from: (1) shipping or
transporting in interstate commerce or foreign commerce, (2) possessing in or affecting
commerce, any firearm or ammunition, or (3) receiving any firearm or ammunition which has
been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. A “crime of domestic violence”
is an offense that has as its factual basis one of the following: (1) the use or attempted use of
 256                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


physical force, or (2) the threatened use of a deadly weapon. One of the factors must be coupled
with a crime committed by a current or former spouse, parent or guardian of the victim; by a
person with whom the victim shares a child in common; by a person who is cohabitating with or
has cohabitated with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian; or, by a person similarly situated
to a spouse, parent or guardian of the victims. Qualifying convictions include a “crime of
domestic violence” tried by general or special court-martial which otherwise meets the elements
of a crime of domestic violence even though not classified as a misdemeanor or felony. 18
U.S.C. § 922(d) and (g). The term “qualifying conviction” does not include summary courts-
martial or the imposition of nonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ.
13.23. Base-Level SJA Responsibilities. If an accused is convicted at a special or general
court-martial of an offense constituting a crime of domestic violence, indicate this on the Report
of Result of Trial. SJAs must also ensure promulgating orders prepared for individuals
convicted of a qualifying offense contain the annotation “Crime of Domestic Violence. 18
U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).” The annotation must be one line, centered, in 14-point boldface type, and
one inch from the top of the page. SJAs are responsible for informing commanders of the impact
of the conviction on the accused’s ability to handle firearms or ammunition as part of their
official duties; briefing commanders on retrieving all Government-issued firearms and
ammunition and suspending the member’s authority to possess Government-issued firearms and
ammunition; and advising members of their commands to lawfully dispose of their privately
owned firearms and ammunition. For additional guidance addressing qualifying offenses, as
well as substantive and procedural requirements under the Act, See 18 U.S.C. §§ 921 and 922.

Section 13O—Staff Judge Advocate’s Responsibilities to Defense Counsel

13.24. The ADC Program. The ADC Program is one of the great strengths of the Air Force
military justice system and will continue to be so as long as the defense function is, and is
perceived to be, independent. A critical responsibility of the SJA is to foster that independence
in words and actions and to treat the ADC as an equal at the bar of justice with the prosecution
function.
13.25. SJA Responsibilities.
   13.25.1. A primary responsibility of the SJA is to ensure that the military justice system is
   fair in perception and in fact. It is important to keep in mind that although the SJA is the
   senior attorney in an office that administers military justice, he or she is not the “chief
   prosecutor.” While it is the SJA’s responsibility to ensure that the government is well
   represented and prepared, the SJA must also see to it that the entire process is properly
   administered, including maintaining a professional relationship with defense counsel. In that
   regard, SJAs should periodically ask defense counsel about their opinions and perceptions
   regarding the various aspects of the military justice system.
   13.25.2. The SJA’s position and seniority demands that he or she take the primary role in
   setting the tone of the relationship with the ADC. This includes promoting civility in the
   relationship with the ADC and in the trial process. The SJA must never make denigrating,
   demeaning, or hostile comments about the ADC, especially in public, nor condone such
   comments by others. Instead, when the SJA considers it necessary to question or criticize the
   actions of the ADC, he or she must raise such matters through the ADC’s supervisory and
   command chain. At all times, the SJA must remember that professionalism requires civility,
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                         257


   a continuous, cordial relationship with the defense bar, vigorous promotion of defense
   independence, and appropriate recognition of the ADC’s achievements.
   13.25.3. The quality of the ADC’s facility and equipment must be equal to or better than that
   of the base legal office. Clients and others who visit ADC offices will not perceive that the
   system is operating on a level playing field unless defense facilities and equipment achieve
   this standard. SJAs are responsible for assisting ADCs in obtaining and maintaining suitable
   facilities and equipment.

Section 13P—Facilitating the Investigation to Disposition Process

13.26. General Provision. An effective military justice process starts with a timely, thorough,
and accurate investigation. JA and investigative personnel, particularly AFOSI, must develop a
collaborative relationship focused on integrating investigative efforts and the legal process. The
goal is thorough, case-ready Reports of Investigation (ROIs), robust litigation preparation, and
timely resolution of military justice cases. Although the remainder of this Section applies
primarily to AFOSI and JA procedures, SJAs will establish local procedures to implement these
goals for all investigations.
13.27. Initial Process. An effective team approach starts at the beginning of the military justice
process. In matters involving alleged violations of the UCMJ or where MEJA may apply, the
AFOSI detachment will notify the local JA when substantive criminal investigations are
initiated. At a minimum, the SJA will designate an attorney to provide initial counsel to the
AFOSI case agent on the new investigation.
13.28. Investigative Support Team. The SJA will designate an investigative support team as
early as practicable in the investigative process. The investigative support team will be
composed of judge advocate(s), as well as civilian attorney(s) and paralegal(s) when appropriate,
who will work with the AFOSI case agent(s) during the investigation to provide legal support.
Members of the investigative support team are not investigators and they must be careful not to
depart from their role. The team should properly safeguard all attorney work-product material.
Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947); United States v. Romano, 46 M.J. 269 (C.A.A.F. 1997);
United States v. Vanderwier, 25 M.J. 263, (C.M.A. 1987).
13.29. Investigative Plan Development. The attorney designated by the SJA and/or the
investigative support team will receive a briefing on the initial investigative steps. The
designated attorney or the investigative support team will continue the collaborative process
during the development of the Investigative Plan and work with the AFOSI case agent in
identifying potential criminal offenses for investigation, comparing the evidence in the case with
the elements of proof for a given offense. JA will coordinate with the AFOSI case agent on
subject interviews.
13.30. Case Development.
   13.30.1. The investigative support team and AFOSI case agents will continue their
   collaborative efforts as the investigation proceeds. As appropriate, designated investigative
   support team members or JA staff members will attend AFOSI case review meetings.
   Likewise, AFOSI personnel are encouraged to attend relevant JA military justice meetings.
   13.30.2. The investigative support team will review and update the initial proof analysis
   crafted by trial counsel to address the elements, evidence, anticipated objections, and
 258                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


   potential defenses for each specification as appropriate, but at least on a monthly basis, for
   JA use. JA will discuss the results of the analysis with AFOSI. A final proof analysis is
   typically attorney work-product material, and will be completed contemporaneously with the
   publication of the ROI. This will also assist in pre-trial preparation efforts.
   13.30.3. In accordance with AFI 51-1001, the SJA will initiate the coordination process as
   early as possible for MEJA cases.
13.31. Disclosure and Reporting of Sensitive Case Information. As a case develops, both the
SJA and AFOSI are required to provide case information and status to higher commands through
their respective reporting channels. To avoid compromising an on-going investigation, the SJA
will not allow disclosure of sensitive investigative information without the AFOSI Detachment
Commander’s/SAC’s concurrence. Some examples of sensitive investigative information would
include AFOSI investigative techniques, case leads, and confidential source information. Once a
case proceeds to trial, the rules of discovery will control the release of any sensitive investigative
information. In addition, AFOSI Form 40s should not be released outside of JA channels
without prior detachment concurrence.
13.32. Lessons Learned. Within 30 calendar days of the conclusion of trial, the SJA and
available members of the trial team will conduct a “hot wash” with AFOSI to review case
lessons learned. Other legal office personnel may attend at the SJA’s and AFOSI detachment
commander’s/SAC’s discretion.

Section 13Q—Support of Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID)

13.33. Defense Sexual Assault Incident Database (DSAID). DSAID is a centralized, case-
level DoD database for the uniform collection of data regarding sexual assaults involving
persons covered by DoD Directive 6495.01, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR)
Program, and DoD Instruction 6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program
Procedures. DSAID captures available information, not limited by Restricted Reporting or
otherwise prohibited by law, about the nature of the assault, the victim, the offender, and the
disposition of reports associated with the assault. DSAID is intended to implement
congressional reporting requirements. DSAID is maintained at base level by the installation
Sexual Assault Response Coordinator and requires information, as necessary, from appropriate
base agencies to complete designated data fields.
   13.33.1. The base SJA will provide the SARC with disposition data on cases entered into
   DSAID. Data to be provided will include information on pretrial confinement, whether the
   case was substantiated as defined in DoDI 6495.02, command action, and the relevant dates.
   Other DSAID data may also be required as necessary.
   13.33.2. The requested DSAID data will be accurate and complete and provided to the
   SARC as soon as possible after the triggering event occurs.

FROM: (JA Office)

SUBJECT: Notification of DNA Processing Responsibilities

1. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. § 1565, 42 U.S.C. § 14135a, 28 C.F.R. § 28.12, and DOD
Instruction 5505.14, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) Collection Requirement for Criminal
Investigations, Enclosure 3, a DNA sample must be collected from (Rank/Full Name of
Member). DNA collection is required because [(charges were preferred) (a 72-hour
commander’s memorandum has approved continued pretrial confinement)(the accused was
convicted by general or special court-martial)].

2. As this member’s immediate commander, you must:

        a. Obtain a DNA collection kit from [(Security Forces) (the Air Force Office of Special
Investigations)(the Air Force Correctional Facility at __________ AFB)(a facility designated by
HQ AFSFC/SFC to maintain such kits, by calling DSN 945-5608 or (210) 925-5608)].

Figure 13.3. Listing of Offenses Requiring Sex Offender Processing in accordance with
DoDI 1325.07, Appendix 4 to Enclosure 2
             LIST OF OFFENSES REQUIRING SEX OFFENDER PROCESSING

A Service member who is convicted in a general or special court-martial of any of the offenses
listed below must register with the appropriate authorities in the jurisdiction (State, the District
of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana
Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, and Indian Tribes) in which he or she will reside, work,
or attend school upon leaving confinement, or upon conviction if not confined. Generally, this
registration must take place within three days of release from confinement or within three days
of conviction if not confined.

Appropriate DoD officials, as designated in implementing Service regulations, must inform the
person so convicted of his or her duty to register and must inform the appropriate officials in the
offender’s stated jurisdiction of residence as soon as possible after conviction (if not confined)
and prior to the prisoner’s release (if confined). Any failure of the appropriate DoD officials to
notify offenders required to be notified of their duty to register will not relieve those offenders of
their duty to register.

A Service member convicted of any offenses listed below or convicted of offenses similar to
those offenses listed below, shall be advised that the individual jurisdictions in which the
offender might live, work, or attend school may require registration for offenses not listed below.
Each registration jurisdiction sets its own sex offender policy and laws.

Effective immediately, reporting (and notice to convicted persons) is required based on a
conviction of any offense listed below, without regard to the date of the offense or the date of the
conviction for anyone currently incarcerated or under supervision (parole or mandatory
supervised release).

The offenses defined before 1 October 2007, are also included to facilitate identification of those
prisoners who were convicted of offenses occurring before 1 October 2007; however, reporting
could still be required if the offense for which convicted occurred before 1 October 2007, but
contained elements that would require reporting if the offense had occurred on or after 1 October
2007.

Notwithstanding the offenses listed below, offense under Article 120 or 134 of the UCMJ that
constitute only public sex acts between consenting adults do not require sex offender registration
(i.e. indecent exposure). An offense involving consensual sexual conduct between adults is not a
reportable offense, unless the adult victim was under the custodial care of the offender at the
time of the offense. Additionally, an offense involving consensual sexual conduct is not a
reportable offense if the victim was at least 13 years old and the offender was not more than 4
years older than the victim (as determined by date of birth).

 AIR FORCE STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND JUDICIAL CONDUCT
 AND DISCIPLINE OF AIR FORCE TRIAL AND APPELLATE MILITARY JUDGES

Section 14A—Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice; Uniform Rules of Practice Before
Air Force Courts-Martial

14.1. Summary. This section transmits the Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice (AFSCJ,
or The Standards) and the Uniform Rules of Practice Before Air Force Courts-Martial (Rules of
Court) which are contained at Attachments 2 and 3 of this Instruction, respectively.
14.2. Background.
   14.2.1. Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice. The Standards have been specifically
   adapted to the unique needs and demands of Air Force legal practice. Although counsel are
   still obligated to their licensing bar authorities, the Standards govern Air Force practice.
   They were adapted from the American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice in
   order to minimize inconsistent ethical requirements. However, when there is a difference
   between state and Air Force standards, the Air Force provisions will control. The AFSCJ
   was first issued by the Corps on 4 December 1989.
   14.2.2. Uniform Rules of Practice Before Air Force Courts-Martial. The Rules of Court
   provide rules for the conduct of Air Force general and special courts-martial and the orderly
   administration of justice by stating in a more formal manner the practices and procedures
   now followed in Air Force courts-martial.
14.3. Applicability.
   14.3.1. The AFSCJ applies to all military and civilian lawyers, paralegals, and nonlawyer
   assistants in the Judge Advocate General’s Corps, USAF. This includes host nation lawyers,
   paralegals, and other host nation personnel employed overseas by the Department of the Air
   Force; to the extent the Standards are not inconsistent with their domestic law and
   professional standards. They also apply to all lawyers, paralegals and nonlawyer assistants
   who practice in Air Force courts and other proceedings, including civilian defense counsel
   (and their assistants) with no other connection to the Air Force. SJAs and Air Force military
   defense counsel are aware of the Standards and have ready access to them.
       14.3.1.1. Be sensitive to the potential for conflict with the expansion of legal assistance
       for victims of crime. See AFI 51-504, paragraph 1.4.16.
   14.3.2. The Rules of Court apply to all military judges and counsel in all general and special
   courts-martial involving Air Force accuseds, including those in which military judges
   assigned to other Services preside.

Section 14B—Judicial Conduct and Discipline of Air Force Trial and Appellate Military
Judges; Air Force Uniform Code of Judicial Conduct; Regulations and Procedures for
Judicial Discipline; Air Force Judicial Ethics Advisory Council Charter
 266                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


14.4. Summary. This section transmits the Air Force Uniform Code of Judicial Conduct (the
Code), the Regulations and Procedures for Judicial Discipline (RPJD), and the Air Force
Judicial Ethics Advisory Council Charter, which are contained at Attachments 4, 5, and 6,
respectively. These three documents provide the framework for establishing and enforcing
standards of conduct among Air Force trial and appellate military judges.
14.5. Background. Respect for the judiciary is essential to maintaining confidence in, and a
high regard for, the military justice system. Therefore, the proper administration of military
justice demands that trial and appellate military judges abide by the law and ethical standards,
which include standards that apply to them due to their judicial duties.
14.6. Applicability. Pursuant to Rule for Courts-Martial 109, Manual for Courts-Martial, The
Judge Advocate General (TJAG) has adopted the Code and the RPJD for Air Force trial and
appellate military judges. The canons and sections of the Code establish mandatory standards
unless otherwise indicated. Where conflicts exist, the more restrictive provisions of law,
regulation, directive, or the Code, shall control.
14.7. Overview.
   14.7.1. Air Force Uniform Code of Judicial Conduct. Attachment 5 requires a judge to
   maintain the integrity and independence of the judiciary, avoid behaving with impropriety or
   the appearance of impropriety, perform judicial duties diligently and impartially, preside or
   participate in a professional and orderly court, determine and apply justice promptly, and
   ensure the preservation of the rights of individual service members.
   14.7.2. Regulations and Procedures for Judicial Discipline. Attachment 6 provides a
   framework for investigating and disposing of allegations of misconduct by Air Force trial or
   appellate military judges.
   14.7.3. Air Force Judicial Ethics Advisory Council Charter. Attachment 7 contains the
   charter for the Air Force Judicial Ethics Advisory Council. This council is established to
   provide a means of obtaining advisory opinions on questions relating to the propriety of
   judicial conduct under the Code.
14.8. Responsibilities.
   14.8.1. The Judge Advocate General.
       14.8.1.1. Reliance on the Code and RPJD. TJAG designates judge advocates as military
       trial and appellate judges pursuant to the provisions of Article 26, Uniform Code of
       Military Justice. Inherent within this authority is TJAG’s obligation to properly
       investigate and fairly dispose of allegations of misconduct or impropriety against any trial
       or appellate military judge. Accordingly, TJAG will be guided by the Code and the
       RPJD in the exercise of this important discretionary function and the provision of due
       process protections to the judges and other persons who are affected by actions taken
       under this policy memorandum.
       14.8.1.2. Establishment of the Air Force Judicial Ethics Advisory Council. By separate
       directive, TJAG establishes the Air Force Judicial Ethics Advisory Council, appoints
       members, and designates a chairman.
   14.8.2. The Chief Judge, United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. The Chief
   Judge shall comply with the provisions of this section and shall ensure that each appellate
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                     267


  military judge is provided a copy. The Chief Judge shall also perform the actions required
  under the RPJD.
  14.8.3. The Chief Trial Judge, USAF Trial Judiciary (USAF/JAT). The Chief Trial Judge
  shall comply with the provisions of this section and shall ensure that each Air Force trial
  judge is provided a copy. The Chief Trial Judge shall also perform the actions required
  under the RPJD.
  14.8.4. Each Trial or Appellate Military Judge. Each trial or appellate military judge shall
  become familiar with the terms of the Code and shall exert his or her best efforts to comply
  with its provisions. Each judge shall also perform the actions required under the RPJD.

                   AIR FORCE STANDARDS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE

The Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice (AFSCJ or the Standards) are directly adapted
from the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards for Criminal Justice. The Standards have
been specifically adapted to the unique needs and demands of Air Force legal practice. Although in
adapting the Standards every effort was made to resolve inconsistencies, in the event of conflict,
the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), MCM, Air Force Instructions (AFI), the Air
Force Rules of Professional Conduct (AFRPC or the Rules), case law, and the Air Force
Uniform Code of Judicial Conduct (AFUCJC) will control. In the event of conflict between the
Standards and the ethics rules of a lawyer’s licensing state, the Standards will control in trials by
courts-martial and related proceedings.

The AFSCJ applies to all military and civilian lawyers, paralegals, and nonlawyer assistants in The
Judge Advocate General’s Corps, USAF. This includes host nation lawyers, paralegals, and other
host nation personnel employed overseas by the Department of the Air Force, to the extent the
Standards are not inconsistent with their domestic law and professional standards. They also apply
to all lawyers, paralegals and nonlawyer assistants who practice in Air Force courts and other
proceedings, including civilian defense counsel (and their assistants), with no other connection to
the Air Force. Staff judge advocates (SJA) and Air Force military defense counsel working with
defense counsel from outside the Air Force should ensure outside counsel are aware of the
Standards and have ready access to them.

Some of the ABA standards are not applicable to the unique requirements of military practice,
and consequently, were not included. Air Force standards that contain substantive modifications
are annotated accordingly. Terminology changes made to conform a standard to Air Force
practice are not so annotated. The following chapters of the ABA Standards apply to Air Force
practice, except as indicated or qualified in the text.

                               THE PROSECUTION FUNCTION

                                SECTION I. General Standards

Standard 3-1.1. The Function of the Standards
These standards are intended to be used as a guide to professional conduct and performance.
They are not intended to be used as criteria for the judicial evaluation of alleged misconduct of
the prosecutor to determine the validity of a conviction. They may or may not be relevant in
such judicial evaluation, depending upon all the circumstances.

Standard 3-1.2. The Function of the Prosecutor

(a) [Omitted]
(b) The prosecutor is both an administrator of justice and an advocate. The prosecutor must
exercise sound discretion in the performance of his or her function.
(c) [Modified] As a trial counsel, the prosecutor represents both the United States and the
interests of justice. The duty of the prosecutor is to seek justice, not merely to convict.
(d) [Modified] It is the duty of the prosecutor to know and be guided by the standards of conduct
applicable to military counsel by the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ); Manual for
Courts-Martial (MCM); AFI 51-201, Administration of Military Justice; and the Air Force Rules
of Professional Conduct (AFRPC or “Rule(s)”).
(e) [Modified] As used in this chapter, the term “unprofessional conduct” denotes conduct
which, in either identical or similar language, is or should be made subject to disciplinary
sanctions pursuant to codes of professional responsibility in force. Where other terms are used,
the standard is intended as a guide to honorable professional conduct and performance.

DISCUSSION
The term “prosecutor” as used throughout this section includes not only the trial counsel, but also
the office of the SJA. Inclusion of the SJA within the definition of the term “prosecutor” should
not be construed to suggest that it reflects a general, disqualifying partiality by SJAs. Where
the standard refers to “trial counsel,” it specifically means the lawyer detailed to the court-
martial. See Rule 3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Trial Counsel; Rule for Courts-Martial
(R.C.M.) 502(d)(5), Duties of Trial and Assistant Trial Counsel. Prosecutors are also obligated
to know and follow the AFRPC and the other standards under subsection (d). Although Trial
Counsel should be cautious to avoid the appearance of undue command influence, Trial Counsel
should normally be allowed to identify his or her client as the “United States” and advocate on
behalf of client. See RCM 502(d)(5) (“[t]he trial counsel shall prosecute cases on behalf of the
United States ….”); Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935) (“[t]he United States
Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty
whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and
whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice
shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the
twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with
 294                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


earnestness and vigor—indeed he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at
liberty to strike foul ones.”); United States v. Golston, 53 M.J. 61, 63 (C.A.A.F. 2000) (“trial
counsel at a court-martial is the representative of the United States Government, and he or she
should act accordingly.”)

Standard 3-1.3. Conflicts of Interest

(a) [Modified] A prosecutor should avoid the appearance or reality of a conflict of interest with
respect to official duties. In some instances, as defined in the AFRPC, failure to do so will
constitute unprofessional conduct.
[(b) – (h) omitted]

DISCUSSION
Particular care must be exercised when the trial counsel has had any previous professional
contact with the accused, either through the legal assistance program or otherwise. In such
circumstances, he or she must notify the SJA, defense counsel and the military judge (if
appropriate) as soon as possible. See United States v. Rushatz, 31 M.J. 450 (C.M.A. 1990);
United States v. Reynolds, 24 M.J. 261 (C.M.A. 1987); United States v. Stubbs, 23 M.J. 188
(C.M.A. 1987); and United States v. Payton, 23 M.J. 379 (C.M.A. 1987). See also Rules 1.7 to
1.13.

Standard 3-1.4. Public Statements
(a) A prosecutor should not make or authorize the making of an extrajudicial statement that a
reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication if the
prosecutor knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial likelihood of
prejudicing a criminal proceeding.
(b) A prosecutor should exercise reasonable care to prevent investigators, law enforcement
personnel, employees, or other persons assisting or associated with the prosecutor from making
an extrajudicial statement that the prosecutor would be prohibited from making under this
standard.

DISCUSSION
All trial counsel and SJAs should also be aware of the provisions of AFI 51-201, Administration
of Military Justice, Chapter 12, regarding releasing information to members of the news media.
See also Rule 3.6, Trial Publicity; and Standards 8-1.1 and 8-2.2.

Standard 3-1.5 Duty to Respond to Misconduct

(a) [Modified] Where a trial counsel knows that another person associated with the legal office is
engaged in action, intends to act or refuses to act in a manner that is a violation of a legal
obligation or violation of the law, the trial counsel should ask the person to reconsider the action
or inaction which is at issue if such a request is aptly timed to prevent such misconduct and is
otherwise feasible. If such a request for reconsideration is unavailing, inapt or otherwise not
feasible or if the seriousness of the matter so requires, the trial counsel should refer the matter to
the SJA.
(b) [Modified] If the SJA insists upon action, or a refusal to act, that is clearly a violation of the
law, the trial counsel may take further remedial action, including revealing the information
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            295


necessary to remedy this violation to appropriate government officials outside the legal office,
including superior lawyers in the functional chain.

Standard 3-2.2.    Interrelationship of Prosecution Offices within a State
Standard 3-2.3.    Assuring High Standards of Professional Skill
Standard 3-2.4.    Special Assistants, Investigative Resources, Experts
Standard 3-2.5.    Prosecutor’s Handbook; Policy Guidelines and Procedures
[All omitted]

Standard 3-2.6. Training Programs
[Modified] Training programs should be established within legal offices and regional offices for
new personnel and for continuing education of the staff.

DISCUSSION
The SJA of the special court-martial convening authority is responsible for training the trial
counsel in his or her office. The senior trial counsel should also take an active role in training
trial counsel within his or her region. See Rule 1.1, Competence.

Standard 3-2.7. Relations With the Police [Omitted]

Standard 3-2.8. Relations with the Courts and Bar
(a) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel intentionally to misrepresent matters of fact or
law to the court.
(b) A trial counsel’s duties necessarily involve frequent and regular official contacts with the
military judge or military judges of the prosecutor’s jurisdiction. In such contacts, the trial
counsel should carefully strive to preserve the appearance as well as the reality of the correct
relationship which professional traditions and canons require between advocates and military
judges.
(c) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel to engage in unauthorized ex parte discussions
with or submission of material to a military judge relating to a particular case which is or may
come before the military judge.
(d) A trial counsel should not fail to disclose to the court legal authority in the controlling
jurisdiction known to the trial counsel to be directly adverse to the trial counsel’s position and
not disclosed by defense counsel.
(e) A trial counsel should strive to develop good working relationships with defense counsel in
order to facilitate the resolution of ethical problems. In particular, trial counsel should assure
defense counsel that if counsel finds it necessary to deliver physical items which may be relevant
to a pending case or investigation to the trial counsel, the trial counsel will not offer the fact of
such delivery by defense counsel as evidence before members for purposes of establishing
defense counsel’s client’s culpability. However, nothing in this standard shall prevent a trial
counsel from offering evidence of the fact of such delivery in a subsequent proceeding for the
purpose of proving a crime or fraud in the delivery of the evidence.

DISCUSSION
 296                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


See the standards in Chapter 3 for more specific guidance with respect to the limits placed on ex
parte contacts between detailed military judges and counsel. See also Rule 3.3, Candor Toward
the Tribunal; Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel; Rule 3.5, Impartiality and
Decorum of the Tribunal; United States v. Copening, 32 M.J. 512 (A.C.M.R. 1990); and United
States v. Berman, 28 M.J. 615 (A.F.C.M.R. 1989).

Standard 3-2.9. Prompt Disposition of Criminal Charges
(a) A trial counsel should avoid unnecessary delay in the disposition of cases. A trial counsel
should not fail to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in prosecuting an accused.
(b) A trial counsel should not intentionally use a procedural device for delay for which there is
no legitimate basis.
(c) The prosecution function should be so organized and supported with staff and facilities to
enable it to dispose of all criminal charges promptly. The trial counsel must be punctual in
attending court and in the submission of all motions, briefs and other papers. The trial counsel
should emphasize to all witnesses the importance of punctuality in attending court.
(d) It is unprofessional conduct intentionally to misrepresent facts or otherwise mislead the court
in order to obtain a continuance.
(e) An SJA, without attempting to get additional resources, should not carry a workload that, by
reason of its excessive size, interferes with the rendering of quality representation, endangers the
interests of justice in the speedy disposition of charges, or may lead to the breach of professional
obligations.

DISCUSSION
In military practice, in some circumstances, noncompliance with procedural rules and
unnecessarily delaying a trial is itself an offense. See Article 98, UCMJ; Rule 3.2, Expediting
Litigation; Rule 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal, subsection (a)(1); and Rule 3.4, Fairness to
Opposing Party and Counsel, subsections (a), (c), and (d).

Standard 3-2.10. Supercession and Substitution of Prosecutor [Omitted]

Standard 3-2.11. Literary or Media Agreements
[Omitted as inapplicable; see DOD 5500.7R, Chapter 2, and Rule 1.8, Conflict of Interest:
Prohibited Transactions.]

SECTION III. Investigation for Prosecution Decision

Standard 3-3.1. Investigative Function of the Prosecutor
(a) A trial counsel ordinarily relies on police and other investigative agencies for investigation of
alleged criminal acts, but the trial counsel has an affirmative responsibility to investigate
suspected criminal activity when it is not adequately dealt with by other agencies.
(b) An SJA should not invidiously discriminate against or in favor of any person on the basis of
race, religion, sex, sexual preference, or ethnicity in exercising discretion to investigate or
recommend prosecution. An SJA should not use other improper considerations in exercising
such discretion.
(c) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel knowingly to use illegal means to obtain
evidence or to employ, instruct or encourage others to use such means.
(d) [Modified] A trial counsel should not improperly discourage or obstruct communication
between prospective witnesses and defense counsel. It is unprofessional conduct for the
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           297


prosecutor to advise any person or cause any person to be advised to decline to give to the
defense information which such person has the right to give.
(e) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel to secure the attendance of persons for
interviews by use of any communication which has the appearance or color of a subpoena or
similar judicial process unless the prosecutor is authorized by law to do so.
(f) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel to promise not to prosecute for prospective
criminal activity, except where such activity is part of an officially supervised investigative or
law enforcement program.
(g) Unless a trial counsel is prepared to forgo impeachment of a witness by the trial counsel’s
own testimony as to what the witness stated in an interview or to seek leave to withdraw from the
case in order to present the impeaching testimony, a trial counsel should avoid interviewing a
prospective witness except in the presence of a third person.

DISCUSSION
Although a witness may not be obligated to submit to an interview with defense counsel under
all circumstances, trial counsel must not induce a refusal to speak with the defense. See United
States v Irwin, 30 M.J. 87 (C.M.A. 1990); United States v. Morris, 24 M.J. 93 (C.M.A. 1987);
Rule 1.1, Competence; Rule 3.7, Lawyer as Witness; Rule 3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Trial
Counsel; and Rules 4.1 to 4.4, Transactions With Persons Other Than Clients.

Standard 3-3.2. Relations with Prospective Witnesses
(a) [Modified] It is unprofessional conduct to compensate a witness, other than an expert, for
giving testimony, but it is not improper to reimburse an ordinary witness for the reasonable
expenses of appearing in court, attendance for depositions pursuant to statute or court rule, or
attendance for pretrial interviews. Payments to a witness may be provided consistent with
guidance in the Joint Travel Regulations, provided there is no attempt to conceal the fact of
reimbursement.
(b) A trial counsel should advise a witness who is to be interviewed of his or her rights against
self-incrimination and the right to counsel whenever the law so requires. It is also proper for a
trial counsel to advise a witness whenever the trial counsel knows or has reason to believe that
the witness may be the subject of a criminal prosecution. However, a trial counsel should not so
advise a witness for the purpose of influencing the witness in favor of or against testifying.
(c) The trial counsel should readily provide victims and witnesses who request it information
about the status of cases in which they are interested.
(d) The trial counsel should seek to insure that victims and witnesses who may need protections
against intimidation are advised of and afforded such protections where feasible.
(e) The trial counsel should ensure that victims and witnesses are given notice as soon as
practicable of scheduling changes which will affect the victims’ or witnesses’ required
attendance at judicial proceedings.
(f) The trial counsel should not require victims and witnesses to attend judicial proceedings
unless their testimony is essential to the prosecution or is so required by law. When their
attendance is required, the trial counsel should seek to reduce to a minimum the time they must
spend at the proceedings.
(g) The trial counsel should seek to insure that victims of serious crimes or their representatives
are given timely notice of: (1) judicial proceedings relating to the victim’s case; (2) disposition
of the case, including pretrial agreements, trial and sentencing; and (3) any decision or action in
the case which results in the accused’s provisional or final release from custody.
 298                                                                       AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


(h) Where practical, the trial counsel should seek to insure that victims of serious crimes or their
representatives are given an opportunity to consult with and to provide information to the trial
counsel prior to the decision whether or not to prosecute, to pursue a disposition by plea, or to
dismiss the charges.


DISCUSSION
Payments to witnesses in the military are governed by the Joint Travel Regulations.

In the circumstances described in subsection (b), prosecutors generally should advise the
prospective witness of his or her Article 31, UCMJ, rights. In these situations, Article 31(b)
warnings are warranted based on the prosecutor’s relationship to the witness, United States v.
Duga, 10 M.J. 206, 210 (C.M.A. 1981), (“because of military rank, duty, or other similar
relationship, there might be subtle pressure on a subject to respond to an inquiry”); and on the
purpose of the questioning, United States v. Loukas, 29 M.J. 385, 387 (C.M.A. 1990) (inquiry
must be part of a law enforcement or disciplinary investigation). A rights advisement is not
required every time a military member questions another military member whom the questioner
suspects of having committed an offense. The relationships of the individuals and the particular
circumstances will determine the need. See Rules 4.1 to 4.4, Transactions with Persons Other
than Clients.

Standard 3-3.3. Relations with Expert Witnesses
(a) A trial counsel who engages an expert for an opinion should respect the independence of the
expert and should not seek to dictate the formation of the expert’s opinion on the subject. To the
extent necessary, the trial counsel should explain to the expert his or her role in the trial as an
impartial expert called to aid the fact finders, and the manner in which the examination of the
witnesses is conducted.
(b) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel to pay an excessive fee for the purpose of
influencing the expert’s testimony or to fix the amount of the fee contingent upon the testimony
the expert will give or the result in the case.

DISCUSSION
See United States v. Mansfield, 24 M.J. 611 (A.F.C.M.R. 1987), concerning relationships with
expert witnesses, and Rule 4.1, Truthfulness in Statements to Others.

Standard 3-3.9. Discretion in the Charging Decision
(a) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel to institute, or cause to be instituted, or to
permit the continued pendency of criminal charges when it is known that the charges are not
supported by probable cause. A trial counsel should not institute or permit the continued
pendency of criminal charges in the absence of admissible evidence to support a conviction.

DISCUSSION
The convening authority ultimately determines what charges will be referred and whether to
convene a court-martial. Trial counsel must inform the SJA for the convening authority
immediately upon discovering that there is insufficient evidence to support a conviction of any
charge. Judicial economy would suggest that an accused should be charged with all known
offenses and tried once; however, this is not required. See R.C.M. 307(c)(4). An accused should
not be brought to trial on charges greater in number or degree than can be reasonably supported
with evidence at the trial. Allegations of offenses should be disposed of in a timely manner at
the lowest appropriate level of disposition. See R.C.M. 306(b). See also Rule 3.8, Special
Responsibilities of a Trial Counsel.

Standard 3-3.10. Role in First Appearance and Preliminary Hearing
[Omitted]

Standard 3-3.11. Disclosure of Evidence by the Prosecutor
(a) [Modified] It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel to intentionally fail to disclose to
the defense, as soon as practicable, the existence of evidence known to the trial counsel which
reasonably tends to negate the guilt of the accused as to an offense charged, or which reasonably
tends to reduce the degree of guilt of the accused of an offense charged, or which reasonably
tends to reduce the punishment of the accused.
(b) The trial counsel should not fail to make a reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally
proper discovery request.
(c) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel intentionally to avoid pursuit of evidence
because he or she believes it will damage the prosecution’s case or aid the accused.

DISCUSSION
For specific guidance on discovery in general, see R.C.M. 701(a); Rule 3.4(d), Fairness to
Opposing Party and Counsel; Standards 11-2.1 to 11-2.6; and United States v. Trimper, 28 M.J.
460 (C.M.A. 1989).

                                SECTION IV. Plea Discussions

Standard 3-4.1. Availability for Plea Discussions
(a) The trial counsel should be willing to consult with defense counsel concerning disposition of
charges by plea.
[(b) omitted]
(c) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel knowingly to make false statements or
representations as to fact or law in the course of plea discussions with defense counsel or the
accused.

DISCUSSION
Pretrial agreement negotiations may be initiated by the accused, defense counsel, trial counsel,
the SJA, convening authority, or their duly authorized representatives. See R.C.M. 705(d).

Standard 3-4.2. Fulfillment of Plea Discussions
(a) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel to make any promise or commitment
concerning the sentence which will be imposed or concerning a suspension of the sentence. A
 300                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


trial counsel may properly advise the defense what position will be taken concerning disposition.
(b) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel to imply a greater power to influence the
disposition of a case than is actually possessed.
(c) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel to fail to comply with a plea agreement, unless
an accused fails to comply with a plea agreement or other extenuating circumstances are present.

Standard 3-4.3     Record of Reasons for Nolle Prosequi Disposition [Omitted]

                                    SECTION V. The Trial

Standard 3-5.1. Calendar Control [Omitted]

Standard 3-5.2. Courtroom Professionalism
(a) The trial counsel should support the authority of the court and dignity of the trial courtroom
by strict adherence to the rules of decorum, and by manifesting an attitude of professional respect
toward the military judge, opposing counsel, witnesses, accused, court members, and others in
the courtroom.
(b) When court is in session, the trial counsel should address the court, not opposing counsel, on
all matters relating to the case.
(c) A trial counsel should comply promptly with all orders and directives of the court, but the
trial counsel has a duty to have the record reflect adverse rulings or judicial conduct which the
trial counsel considers prejudicial. The trial counsel has a right to make respectful requests for
reconsideration of adverse rulings.
 (d) Trial counsels should cooperate with courts and the organized bar in developing codes of
decorum and professional etiquette for each jurisdiction.

DISCUSSION
The Chief Trial Judge, USAF Trial Judiciary (HQ USAF/JAT), and/or the Chief Regional
Military Judge for the trial judiciary region in which the trial is located may promulgate rules for
courts-martial within that region. See also Standard 6-3.1; Rule 3.2, Expediting Litigation; Rule
3.3, Candor Toward The Tribunal; and Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel.

Standard 3-5.3. Selection of Court Members
(a) The trial counsel should prepare himself or herself prior to trial to discharge effectively the
prosecution function in the selection of the court and the exercise of challenges for cause and
peremptory challenges.
(b) In those cases where it appears necessary to conduct a pretrial investigation of the
background of court members, investigatory methods of the trial counsel should neither harass
nor unduly embarrass potential court members or invade their privacy and, wherever possible,
should be restricted to an investigation of records and sources of information already in
existence.
(c) The opportunity to question court members should be used solely to obtain information for
the intelligent exercise of challenges. A trial counsel should not intentionally use the voir dire to
present factual matters which the trial counsel knows will not be admissible at trial or to argue
the trial counsel’s case to the court members.

DISCUSSION
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           301


This standard refers specifically to voir dire and trial counsel’s preparation for voir dire. See
R.C.M. 912, regarding questionnaires submitted to detailed court members. If the trial counsel
is aware of any matters which might be grounds for a valid challenge for cause against a
member, he or she should so advise the SJA for the convening authority prior to trial. See also
United States v. Credit, 2 M.J. 631 (A.F.C.M.R. 1976).

Standard 3-5.4. Relations with Court Members
(a) [Modified] It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel to communicate privately with
court members concerning a case before or during trial. The trial counsel should avoid the
reality or the appearance of any such improper communications.
(b) The trial counsel should treat court members with deference and respect, but should avoid the
reality or appearance of currying favor by a show of undue solicitude for their comfort or
convenience.
(c) [Modified] After discharge of the members from further consideration of a case, it is
unprofessional conduct for the trial counsel to intentionally make comments to or ask questions
of a court member for the purpose of harassing or embarrassing the member in any way which
will tend to influence judgment in future cases.

DISCUSSION
It is permissible for the trial counsel to ask a court member for a critique of his or her
performance in the trial, so long as such request does not involve soliciting from the court
member his or her vote on the findings and/or sentence. It is also permissible for the trial counsel
to communicate the time and place court members should report or other similar administrative
matters. See Rule 3.5, Impartiality and Decorum of the Tribunal.

Standard 3-5.5. Opening Statement
The trial counsel’s opening statement should be confined to a statement of the issues in the case
and remarks on evidence the trial counsel intends to offer which the trial counsel believes in
good faith will be available and admissible. It is unprofessional conduct to allude to any
evidence unless there is a good faith and reasonable basis for believing that such evidence will be
tendered and admitted in evidence.

Standard 3-5.6. Presentation of Evidence
(a) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel knowingly to offer false evidence, whether by
documents, tangible evidence, or the testimony of witnesses, or fail to seek withdrawal thereof
upon discovery of its falsity.
(b) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel knowingly and for the purpose of bringing
inadmissible matters to the attention of the military judge or court members to offer inadmissible
evidence, ask legally objectionable questions, or make other impermissible comments or
arguments in the presence of the military judge or court members.
(c) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel to permit any tangible evidence to be
displayed in the view of the military judge or court members, which would tend to prejudice fair
consideration by the military judge or members until such time as a good faith tender of such
evidence is made.
(d) It is unprofessional conduct to tender tangible evidence in the view of the court members if it
would tend to prejudice fair consideration by the members, unless there is a reasonable basis for
its admission in evidence. When there is any substantial doubt about the admissibility of such
 302                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


evidence, it should be tendered by an offer of proof and a ruling obtained.

DISCUSSION
In a trial before members, if the trial counsel has reason to believe that there will be an objection
to an item of evidence, the evidence should be offered in an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, and a
ruling on admissibility obtained from the military judge. See Military Rules of Evidence
(M.R.E.) 103(c).

Standard 3-5.7. Examination of Witnesses
(a) The interrogation of all witnesses should be conducted fairly, objectively, and with due
regard for the dignity and legitimate privacy of the witness, and without seeking to intimidate or
humiliate the witness unnecessarily.
(b) [Modified] The trial counsel’s belief that the witness is telling the truth does not preclude
cross- examination, but may affect the method and scope of cross-examination. A trial counsel
should not abuse the power of cross-examination to discredit or undermine a witness if the trial
counsel knows the witness is testifying truthfully.
(c) A trial counsel should not call a witness in the presence of court members who the trial
counsel knows will claim a valid privilege not to testify.
(d) It is unprofessional conduct for a trial counsel to ask a question which implies the existence
of a factual predicate for which a good faith belief is lacking.

DISCUSSION
If the trial counsel is informed in advance that a witness will claim a privilege, and the trial
counsel wishes to contest the claim or demonstrate the witness’s unavailability, the matter should
be treated without the members present in an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session. See M.R.E. 104 and
Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel. This rule by no means precludes trial counsel
from legitimately impeaching witnesses as to the accuracy and completeness of their
recollections, their biases, their ability to perceive the facts and events, etc.

Subsection (b) has been modified to recognize a trial counsel’s dilemma when faced with a
witness who incorrectly believes he or she is testifying truthfully, or who offers an ill-considered,
but true, opinion. In the second sentence of the subsection, the word “use” in the ABA Standard
has been replaced by the word “abuse.”

Standard 3-5.8. Argument to the Court Members
(a) The trial counsel may argue all reasonable inferences from evidence in the record. It is
unprofessional conduct for the trial counsel intentionally to misstate the evidence or mislead the
court members as to inferences that they may draw.
(b) It is unprofessional conduct for the trial counsel to express his or her personal belief or
opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimony or evidence, or the guilt of the accused.
(c) The trial counsel should not use arguments calculated to inflame the passions or prejudices of
the court members.
(d) The trial counsel should refrain from any argument which would divert the court from its
duty to decide the case on the evidence.
(e) [Added] It is the responsibility of the military judge to ensure that argument to the court
members is kept within proper, accepted bounds.
DISCUSSION
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                              303


Arguments on findings are governed by R.C.M. 919. Sentencing arguments are regulated by
R.C.M. 1001(g). It is permissible, in sentencing argument, to refer to deterrence of others from
committing a similar offense as that of the accused, as long as such argument is reasonably
balanced with the other sentencing goals. The military judge always has a sua sponte obligation
to ensure that arguments are proper, and, if improper argument occurs, to immediately give
appropriate curative instructions, even in the absence of objection by the defense. See also Rule
3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal; and Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel.

Standard 3-5.9. Facts Outside the Record
It is unprofessional conduct for the trial counsel to intentionally refer to or argue on the basis of
facts outside the record whether at trial or on appeal, unless such facts are matters of common
public knowledge based on ordinary human experience or matters of which the court may take
judicial notice.

DISCUSSION
This standard in military practice would apply not only to the trial counsel, but also to counsel
from the Appellate Government Division who are assigned to the case on appeal. See Rule 3.3,
Candor Toward the Tribunal; Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel; and Standard 4-
7.9. C.f., M.R.E. 201 and 201A.

Standard 3-5.10. Comments by Prosecutor after Trial
The prosecutor should not make public comments critical of the findings or sentence, whether
rendered by military judge or court members.

DISCUSSION
See AFI 51-201, Chapter 12; ABA Standard 8-1.1, Extrajudicial Statements by Lawyers; and
Rule 3.6, Trial Publicity.

                                    SECTION VI. Sentencing

Standard 3-6.1. Role in Sentencing
(a) The trial counsel should not make the severity of sentences the index of his or her
effectiveness. To the extent that the trial counsel becomes involved in the sentencing process, he
or she should seek to insure that a fair and informed judgment is made on the sentence and to
avoid unfair sentence disparities.
[(b) and (c) omitted]

DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 1001.

Standard 3-6.2. Information Relevant to Sentencing [Omitted]

DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 1001 for sentencing procedures. The trial counsel will disclose to the defense, upon
request, the information described in R.C.M. 701(a)(5).

                                  THE DEFENSE FUNCTION

                             SECTION I. Role of Defense Counsel

Standard 4-1.1. The Function of the Standards
These standards are intended to be used as a guide to professional conduct and performance.
They are not intended to be used as criteria for the judicial evaluation of alleged misconduct of
defense counsel to determine the validity of a conviction. They may or may not be relevant in
such judicial evaluation, depending upon all the circumstances.

Standard 4-1.2. Role of Defense Counsel
(a) Counsel for the accused is an essential component of the administration of criminal justice.
A court properly constituted to hear a criminal case must be viewed as an entity consisting of the
military judge, court members (where appropriate), trial counsel and defense counsel.
(b) The basic duty the defense counsel owes to the administration of justice and as an officer of
the court is to serve as the accused’s counselor and advocate with courage and devotion and to
render effective, quality representation.
(c) [Omitted]
(d) The defense counsel should seek to reform and improve the administration of criminal
justice. When inadequacies or injustices in the substantive or procedural law come to defense
counsel’s attention, he or she should stimulate efforts for remedial action.
(e) The defense counsel, in common with all members of the bar, is subject to standards of
conduct stated in statutes, rules, decisions of courts and codes, canons, or other standards of
professional conduct. The defense counsel has no duty to execute any directive of the accused
which does not comport with law or such standards. The defense counsel is the professional
representative of the accused, not the accused’s alter ego.
(f) It is unprofessional conduct for a defense counsel intentionally to misrepresent matters of fact
or law to the court.
(g) Defense counsel should disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction
known to defense counsel to be directly adverse to the position of the accused and not disclosed
by the prosecutor.
(h) It is the duty of defense counsel to know and be guided by the standards of professional
conduct as defined in codes and canons of the legal profession, applicable in defense counsel’s
jurisdiction. The functions and duties of defense counsel are the same whether defense counsel is
assigned or (in the case of civilian lawyers) privately retained.
(f) As used in this chapter, the term "unprofessional conduct" denotes conduct which, in either
identical or similar language, is or should be made subject to disciplinary sanctions pursuant to
codes of professional responsibility. Where other terms are used, the standard is intended as a
guide to honorable conduct and performance.
Standard 4-1.3. Delays: Punctuality (a) Defense counsel should act with reasonable diligence
and promptness in representing a client.
(b) Defense counsel should avoid unnecessary delay in the disposition of cases. Defense counsel
should be punctual in attending court and in the submission of all motions, briefs and other
papers. Defense counsel should emphasize to the client and all witnesses the importance of
punctuality and attending court.
(c) It is unprofessional conduct for defense counsel intentionally to misrepresent facts or
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           305


otherwise mislead the court in order to obtain a continuance.
(d) Defense counsel should not intentionally use procedural devices for delay for which there is
no legitimate basis.
[(e) omitted]

DISCUSSION
Implicit in this standard is the understanding that defense counsel must provide effective
representation to each and every client. The term "unnecessary delay" should be interpreted as
delays beyond the time reasonably necessary to adequately prepare and represent each client.
What is "reasonably necessary" will vary based upon several factors, including the number and
complexity of cases counsel is responsible for, the availability of resources and witnesses and a
variety of other factors.

By way of illustration, the omitted subsection (e) addresses lawyers who accept more
employment than they can effectively handle. While military defense counsel do not enjoy the
luxury of voluntarily limiting the number of clients they represent, they must be equally mindful
of the limits of their effectiveness. Such limitations may affect appointment of counsel. See
Rule 1.2, Establishment and Scope of Representation; Rule 1.3, Diligence; Rule 3.2, Expediting
Litigation; and Rule 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal.

Standard 4-1.4. Public Statements
Defense counsel should not make or authorize the making of an extrajudicial statement that a
reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication if
defense counsel knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial likelihood of
prejudicing a criminal proceeding.

DISCUSSION
See Rule 3.6, Trial Publicity, and Standard 8-1.1.

Standard 4-1.5 Advisory Committee on Professional Responsibility and Standards
[Modified] Counsel should be aware of The Judge Advocate General’s Advisory Committee on
Professional Responsibility and Standards. The committee consists of the Directors of Civilian
Professional Development, Plans and Programs, the USAF Judiciary, and Civil Law and
Litigation. Defense counsel inquiries to the Advisory Committee that are submitted through the
Trial Defense Division enjoy the same confidentiality as the client is entitled to through the
lawyer-client relationship. The Advisory Committee may issue binding advisory opinions with
the concurrence of The Judge Advocate General.
Standard 4-1.6. Trial Lawyer’s Duty to Administration of Justice [Omitted]
DISCUSSION
Generally, this standard encourages all experienced trial lawyers to qualify themselves and stand
ready to undertake the defense of an accused. It was omitted as not entirely consistent with the
establishment and administration of an independent defense bar within the Air Force.
Conceivably, it could apply in the case of individually requested counsel, who must be qualified
and certified under Article 27(b), UCMJ, in order to act in that capacity. The same standards
govern a defense counsel’s conduct regardless, of whether or not he or she is assigned to the Air
 306                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013

DISCUSSION
See AFI 51-201

                          SECTION III. Lawyer-Client Relationship

Standard 4-3.1. Establishment of Relationship
(a) Defense counsel should seek to establish a relationship of trust and confidence with the
accused and should discuss the objectives of the representation and whether defense counsel will
continue to represent the accused if there is an appeal. Counsel should explain the necessity of
full disclosure of all facts known to the client for an effective defense, and the extent to which
counsel’s obligation of confidentiality makes privileged the accused’s disclosures.
 (b) To ensure the privacy essential for confidential communication between a lawyer and client,
adequate facilities should be available for private discussions between counsel and accused in
jails, prisons, courthouses, and other places where accused persons must confer with counsel.
(c) Personnel of jails, prisons, and custodial institutions should be prohibited by law or
administrative regulations from examining or otherwise interfering with any communication
between client and lawyer relating to any legal action arising out of charges or incarceration.

DISCUSSION
See generally, M.R.E. 502; AFI 31-205, The Air Force Corrections System; Rule 1.4,
Communication; and Rule 1.6, Confidentiality of Information.

Standard 4-3.2. Interviewing the Client
(a) As soon as practicable the defense counsel should seek to determine all relevant facts known
to the accused. In so doing, counsel should probe for all legally relevant information without
seeking to influence the direction of the client’s responses.
(b) It is unprofessional conduct for the Defense counsel to instruct the client or to intimate to the
client in any way that the client should not be candid in revealing facts so as to afford the defense
counsel free rein to take action which would be precluded by counsel’s knowing of such facts.

Standard 4-3.3. Fees
[Omitted]

DISCUSSION
Military lawyers do not charge or collect fees; however, civilian lawyers practicing before Air
Force courts- martial are bound by state and federal bar standards. See ABA Rule 1.5, Fees.

Standard 4-3.4. Obtaining Publication Rights from the Accused
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            307


[Omitted as inapplicable; see DOD 5500.7R, Chapter 2, and Rule 1.8, Conflict of Interest:
Prohibited Transactions.]

Standard 4-3.5. Conflicts of Interest
(a) Defense counsel should not permit his or her professional judgment or obligations to be
affected by his or her own political, financial, business, property, or personal interests.
(b) Defense counsel should disclose to the accused at the earliest feasible opportunity any
interest in or connection with the case or any other matter that might be relevant to the accused’s
selection of a lawyer to represent him or her or the lawyer’s continued representation. Such
disclosure should include communication of information reasonably sufficient to permit the
client to appreciate the significance of any conflict or potential conflict of interest.
(c) Except for preliminary matters such as initial hearings, counsel should not undertake to
defend more than one accused in the same criminal case if the duty to one accused may conflict
with the duty to another. The potential for conflict of interest is so grave that ordinarily a lawyer
should decline to act for more than one of several co-defendants, except in unusual situations
when, after careful investigation, it is clear either that no conflict is likely to develop at trial,
sentencing, or at any other time in the proceeding or that common representation will be
advantageous to each of the accused represented, and in either case, that:
 (i) each accused gives an informed consent to such multiple representation; and
(ii) the consent of each accused is made a matter of judicial record.
In determining the presence of consent by each accused, the military judge should make
appropriate inquiries respecting actual or potential conflicts of interest of counsel and whether
each accused fully comprehends the difficulties that a defense counsel sometimes encounters in
defending multiple clients.

502(d)(2); and Rules 1.7 to 1.9, Conflict of Interest.

Standard 4-3.6. Prompt Action To Protect the Accused
Many important rights of the accused can be protected and preserved only by prompt legal
action. Defense counsel should inform the accused of his or her rights at the earliest opportunity
and take all necessary action to vindicate such rights. Counsel should consider all procedural
steps which in good faith may be taken, including, for example, moving to seek pretrial release
of the accused, obtaining psychiatric examination of the accused when a need appears, moving
for change of venue or continuance, moving to suppress illegally obtained evidence, moving for

Standard 4-3.7. Advice and Service on Anticipated Unlawful Conduct
(a) It is a defense counsel’s duty to advise a client to comply with the law, but the lawyer may
 308                                                                       AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


advise concerning the meaning, scope, and validity of the law.
(b) It is unprofessional conduct for a Defense counsel to counsel a client in or knowingly assist a
client to engage in conduct which counsel knows to be illegal or fraudulent but defense counsel
may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct with a client.
(c) [Modified]It is unprofessional conduct for a Defense counsel to agree in advance of the
commission of a crime that counsel will serve as counsel for the accused, except as part of a
bona fide effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning, or application of the law.
(d) A defense counsel shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the
client consents after consultation, except for disclosures that are implicitly authorized in order to
carry out the representation, and except as stated in paragraph (e).
(e) [Added] A defense counsel may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer reasonably
believes necessary:
         (i) to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that the defense counsel believes
is likely to result in imminent death or substantial bodily harm, or substantial impairment of
national security or the readiness or capability of a military unit, vessel, aircraft, or weapons
system; or
         (ii) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the defense counsel in a controversy
between counsel and client, to establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against
counsel based upon conduct in which the client was involved, or to respond to allegations in any
proceeding concerning a defense counsel’s representation of the client.
         (iii) to prevent the client from attempting suicide or causing serious bodily harm to
herself or himself; or
         (iv) to assist Air Force authorities in locating the client when those authorities believe the
client may attempt suicide or cause serious bodily harm to herself or himself.

DISCUSSION
Subparagraph (d) was substituted and subparagraph (e) was added in order to eliminate
inconsistency with Rule 1.6, Confidentiality. A defense counsel’s duty to a client is a strong
one. There may be situations where a defense counsel can act to avoid and prevent ongoing or
potential misconduct without violating client confidences, and these alternatives should be
considered first. Only in the very extreme and limited circumstances described above may a
lawyer be excused from his fundamental obligation to preserve client confidences. Submissions
by an appellant under United States v. Grostefon, 12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A. 1982), are included in the
category of complaints against counsel discussed in subsection (e)(2); however, counsel may not
reveal confidences that are either beyond the scope or irrelevant to such complaints. See Rule
1.2, Establishment and Scope of Representation; Rule 1.6, Confidentiality of Information; and
Standard 4-7.7.

Subparagraphs (e)(iii) and (e)(iv) were added to preclude even the appearance of an ethical
violation if a counsel discloses either confidences or information pertaining to the representation
of a client to prevent a client from attempting suicide or physically harming himself or herself.
These additions derive primarily from the fact that self-injuries are criminal acts under the
UCMJ. Counsel in such circumstances should disclose only so much information as is
necessary to prevent the client from harming himself or herself and should not forego
opportunities to prevent clients from harming themselves via means other than disclosure of
protected information.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                        309


Standard 4-3.8. Duty To Keep Client Informed
(a) Defense counsel has a duty to keep the accused informed of the developments in the case and
the progress of preparing the defense and should promptly comply with reasonable requests for
information.
(b) Defense counsel should explain developments in the case to the extent reasonably necessary
to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.

DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 502(d)(6) and Rule 1.4, Communication.

4.3.9.   Obligations of Hybrid or Standby Counsel [Omitted]

                       SECTION IV. Investigation and Preparation

Standard 4-4.1. Duty To Investigate
(a) Defense counsel should conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and
to explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the
event of a conviction. The investigation should always include efforts to secure information in
the possession of the prosecution and law enforcement authorities. The duty to investigate exists
regardless of the accused’s admissions or statements to the defense counsel of facts constituting
guilt or the accused’s stated desire to plead guilty.
(b) Defense counsel should not seek to acquire possession of physical evidence personally or
through use of an investigator where defense counsel’s sole purpose is to obstruct access to such
evidence.
DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 502(d)(6); R.C.M. 701; Rule 1.1, Competence; and United States v Polk, 32 M.J.
150 (C.M.A. 1991).

Standard 4-4.2. Illegal Investigation
It is unprofessional conduct for defense counsel knowingly to use illegal means to obtain
evidence or information or to employ, instruct, or encourage others to do so.

DISCUSSION
See Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel; Rule 5.1, Responsibilities of a
Supervisory Lawyer; and Rule 5.3, Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants.

Standard 4-4.3. Relations with Prospective Witnesses
(a) Defense counsel, in representing an accused, should not use means that have no substantial
purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person, or use methods of obtaining
evidence that violate the legal rights of such a person.
(b) It is unprofessional conduct to compensate a witness, other than an expert, for giving
testimony, but it is not improper to reimburse a witness for the reasonable expenses consistent
with guidance in the Joint Travel Regulations, provided there is no attempt to conceal
reimbursement.
(c) It is not necessary for defense counsel or an investigator for the defense, in interviewing a
prospective witness, to caution the witness concerning possible self-incrimination and the need
for counsel.
(d) A defense counsel should not discourage or obstruct communication between prospective
 310                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


witnesses and the trial counsel. It is unprofessional conduct to advise any person, other than a
client, or cause such person to be advised to decline to give to the trial counsel or counsel for co-
defendants information which such person has a right to give.
(e) Unless defense counsel is prepared to forgo impeachment of a witness by counsel’s own
testimony as to what the witness stated in an interview or to seek leave to withdraw from the case
in order to present such impeaching testimony, counsel should avoid interviewing a prospective
witness, except in the presence of a third person.

DISCUSSION
See Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel; Rule 3.7, Lawyer as Witness; Rule 4.1,
Truthfulness in Statements to Others; Rule 4.2, Communication With Person Represented by
Counsel; Rule 4.3, Dealing with Unrepresented Person; and Rule 4.4, Respect for Rights of
Third Persons. But see United States v. Baca, 27 M.J. 110 (C.M.A. 1988), and United States v.
Cook, 27 M.J. 212 (C.M.A. 1988).

Subsection (c) recognizes that a defense counsel need not advise a prospective military witness
of his or her rights. Contra United States v. Duga, 10 M.J. 206, 210 (C.M.A. 1981) ("because of
military rank, duty, or other similar relationship, there might be subtle pressure on a subject to
respond to an inquiry"). But see United States v. Loukas, 29 M.J. 385, 387 (C.M.A. 1990)
(inquiry must be part of a law enforcement or disciplinary investigation).

Standard 4-4.4. Relations with Expert Witnesses
(a) A defense counsel who engages an expert for an opinion should respect the independence of
the expert and should not seek to dictate the information of the expert’s opinion on the subject.
To the extent necessary, counsel should explain to the expert his or her role in the trial as an
impartial witness called in to aid the fact finders, and the manner in which the examination of
witnesses is conducted.
(b) It is unprofessional conduct for a defense counsel to pay an excessive fee for the purpose of
influencing the expert’s testimony or to fix the amount of the fee contingent upon the testimony
the expert will give or the result in the case.

DISCUSSION
See United States v. Mansfield, 24 M.J. 611 (A.F.C.M.R. 1987); Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing
Party and Counsel; Rule 4.1, Truthfulness in Statements to Others; and Rule 4.3, Dealing With
Unrepresented Person.

Standard 4-4.5. Compliance with Discovery Procedure
Defense counsel should make a reasonably diligent effort to comply with a legally proper
discovery request.

DISCUSSION
See generally, R.C.M. 701(b); Rule 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal; Rule 3.4, Fairness to
Opposing Party and Counsel; and AFSCJ, Chapter 5.

4-4.6. Physical Evidence
(a) Defense counsel who receives a physical item under circumstances implicating a client in
criminal conduct should disclose the location of or should deliver that item to law enforcement
authorities only: (1) if required by law or court order, or (2) as provided in paragraph (d)
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            311


(b) Unless required to disclose, defense counsel should return the item to the source from whom
the defense counsel received it, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d). In returning the
item to the source, defense counsel should advise the source of the legal consequences pertaining
to the possession or destruction of the item. Defense counsel should also prepare a written
record of these events for his or her file, but should not give the source a copy of such record.
(c) Defense counsel may receive the item for a reasonable period of time during which the
defense counsel: (1) intends to return it to the owner; (2) reasonably fears that the return of the
item to the source will result in destruction of the item; (3) reasonably fears that return of the
item to the source will result in physical harm to anyone; (4) intends to examine, inspect, or use
the item in any way as part of the defense counsel’s representation of the client; or (5) cannot
return it to the source. If defense counsel tests or examines the item, he or she should thereafter
return it to the source unless there is reason to believe that the evidence might be altered or
destroyed or used to harm another or return is otherwise impossible. If defense counsel retains
the item, he or she should retain it in his or her law office in a manner that does not impede the
lawful ability of law enforcement authorities to obtain the item.
(d) If the item received is contraband, i.e., an item possession of which is in and of itself a crime
such as narcotics, defense counsel may suggest that the client destroy it where there is no
pending case or investigation relating to this evidence and where such destruction is clearly not
in violation of any criminal statute. If such destruction is not permitted by law or if in defense
counsel’s judgment he or she cannot retain the item, whether or not it is contraband, in a way that
does not pose an unreasonable risk of physical harm to anyone, defense counsel should disclose
the location of or should deliver the item to law enforcement authorities.
(e) If defense counsel discloses the location of or delivers the item to law enforcement authorities
under paragraphs (a) or (d), or to a third party under paragraph (c)(1), he or she should do so in
the way best designed to protect the client’s interests.

                      SECTION V. Control and Direction of Litigation

Standard 4-5.1. Advising the Accused
(a) After informing himself or herself fully on the facts and the law, the defense counsel should
advise the accused with complete candor concerning all aspects of the case, including a candid
estimate of the probable outcome.
(b) It is unprofessional conduct for the defense counsel intentionally to understate or overstate
the risks, hazards, or prospects of the case to exert undue influence on the accused’s decision as
to his or her plea.
(c) The defense counsel should caution the client to avoid communication about the case with the
witnesses, except with the approval of counsel, to avoid any contact with court members or
prospective court members, and to avoid either the reality or the appearance of any other
improper activity.

DISCUSSION
See Rule 1.2, Establishment and Scope of Representation; Rule 1.4, Communication; Rule 2.1,
Advisor; Rule 3.1, Meritorious Claims and Contentions; Rule 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal;
and Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel.

Standard 4-5.2. Control and Direction of the Case
(a) [Modified] Certain decisions relating to the conduct of the case are ultimately for the accused
 312                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


and others are ultimately for defense counsel. The decisions which are to be made by the
accused after full consultation with counsel are:
         (i) which pleas to enter;
         (ii) whether to accept a pre-trial agreement
         (iii) whether to waive trial by court members, or if the accused elects trial by court
members, whether to request enlisted members; and
         (iii) whether to testify in his or her own behalf.
(b) Strategic and tactical decisions should be made by defense counsel after consultation with the
client where feasible and appropriate. Such decisions include what witnesses to call, whether
and how to conduct cross-examination, what court members to challenge, what trial motions
should be made, and what evidence should be introduced.
(c) If a disagreement on significant matters of tactics or strategy arises between the defense
counsel and the accused, the defense counsel should make a record of the circumstances,
counsel’s advice and reasons, and the conclusion reached. The record should be made in a
manner which protects the confidentiality of the lawyer-client relationship.

DISCUSSION
See Rule 1.2, Establishment and Scope of Representation; Rule 1.6, Confidentiality of
Information; R.C.M. 502(d)(6); R.C.M. 910; and Standard 4-8.2.

                           SECTION VI. Disposition without Trial

Standard 4-6.1. Duty to Explore Disposition without Trial
(a) Whenever the law, nature, and circumstances of the case permit, the defense counsel should
explore the possibility of an early diversion of the case from the criminal process.
(b) A defense counsel may engage in plea discussions with the convening authority through the
SJA. Under no circumstances should a defense counsel recommend that an accused accept a
plea agreement unless appropriate investigation and study of the case has been completed,
including an analysis of controlling law and the evidence likely to be introduced at trial.

DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 705 and 910(f)(1). Examples of "diversions" from the criminal process in military
practice are resignations for the good of the service, requests for administrative discharge in lieu
of court-martial, retirement requests, etc. See also Rule 1.2, Establishment and Scope of
Representation; Rule 1.4, Communication; and Rule 2.1, Advisor.

Standard 4-6.2. Plea Discussions
(a) Defense counsel should keep the accused advised of developments arising out of plea
discussions conducted with the trial counsel.
(b) Defense counsel should promptly communicate and explain to the accused all significant plea
proposals made by the trial counsel.
(c) It is unprofessional conduct for a defense counsel knowingly to make false statements
concerning the evidence in the course of plea discussions with the trial counsel.
(d) It is unprofessional conduct for a defense counsel to seek concessions favorable to one client
by any agreement which is detrimental to the legitimate interests of a client in another case.
(e) [Modified] Defense counsel representing two or more clients in the same or related cases
should not participate in making an aggregated agreement as to guilty pleas, unless each client
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           313


consents after consultation, including disclosure of the existence and nature of all the claims or
pleas involved.

DISCUSSION
See Rule 1.4, Communication; Rules 1.7 to 1.9, Conflict of Interest; Rule 3.3, Candor Toward
the Tribunal; Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel; R.C.M. 502, 705, and 910; and
AFI 51-201, Chapter 6. See also United States v. Newak, 24 M.J. 238 (C.M.A. 1987).

                                     SECTION VII. Trial

Standard 4-7.1. Courtroom Professionalism
(a) As an officer of the court, the defense counsel should support the authority of the court and
the dignity of the trial courtroom by strict adherence to the codes of professionalism, and by
manifesting a professional attitude toward the military judge, opposing counsel, witnesses, court
members, and others in the courtroom.
(b) Defense counsel should not engage in unauthorized ex parte discussions with or submission
of material to a military judge relating to a particular case which is or may come before the
judge.
(c) When court is in session, defense counsel should address the court and should not address the
trial counsel directly on all matter relating to the case.
 (d) The defense counsel should comply promptly with all orders and directives of the court, but
the defense counsel has a duty to have the record reflect adverse rulings or judicial conduct
which counsel considers prejudicial to his or her client’s legitimate interests. Defense counsel
has a right to make respectful requests for reconsiderations of adverse rulings.
(e) Counsel should cooperate with courts and the organized bar in developing codes of
professionalism for each jurisdiction.

DISCUSSION
The Chief Trial Judge, USAF Trial Judiciary may promulgate rules for courts-martial. See
United States v. Klein, 20 M.J. 26, 28 (C.M.A. 1985) ("Counsel should not hesitate, in the
zealous representation of their clients, to pin the military judge down to preserve an issue"). See
also Rule 3.5, Impartiality and Decorum of the Tribunal.

Standard 4-7.2. Selection of Court Members
(a) The defense counsel should prepare himself or herself before trial to discharge effectively his
or her function in the selection of court members, including the raising of any appropriate issues
concerning the method by which the court panel was selected and the exercise of both challenges
for cause and peremptory challenges.
(b) In those cases where it appears necessary to conduct a pretrial investigation of the
background of court members, investigatory methods of a defense counsel should neither harass
nor unduly embarrass potential court members or invade their privacy and, wherever possible,
should be restricted to an investigation of records and sources of information already in
existence.
(c) The opportunity to question court members personally should be used solely to obtain
information for the intelligent exercise of challenges. Defense counsel should not intentionally
use the voir dire to present factual matters which counsel knows will not be admissible at trial or
to argue the defense counsel’s case to the court members.
 314                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013



DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 912; Rule 3.3, Candor Toward The Tribunal; Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party
and Counsel; Rule 4.4, Respect for Rights of Third Persons; and United States v. Credit, 2 M.J.
631 (A.F.C.M.R. 1976).

Standard 4-7.3. Relations with Court Members
(a) [Modified]It is unprofessional conduct for defense counsel to communicate privately with
court members concerning the case before or during the trial. The defense counsel should avoid
the reality or appearance of any such improper communications.
(b) Defense counsel should treat court members with deference and respect, avoiding the reality
or appearance of currying favor by a show of undue solicitude for their comfort or convenience.
(c) After discharge of the court members from further consideration of the case, it is
unprofessional conduct for a defense counsel to intentionally make comments to or ask questions
of a court member in any way which will tend to influence judgment in future service as a court
member. If the defense counsel believes that the findings or sentence may be subject to legal
challenge, counsel may properly communicate with court members to determine whether such
challenge may be available.

DISCUSSION
Nothing precludes a lawyer from seeking a critique or clemency recommendation from a court
member. What is prohibited are "improper" communications which may be further defined by
the Uniform Rules of Practice Before Air Force Courts-Martial. See M.R.E. 606(b) and R.C.M.
923. It is permissible for defense counsel to ask a court member to critique his or her
performance in the trial, so long as the request does not involve soliciting the court member’s
vote on findings or sentence. See also Standard 3-5.4, and Rule 3.5, Impartiality and Decorum
of the Tribunal.

Standard 4-7.4. Opening Statement
Defense counsel’s opening statement should be confined to a brief statement of the issues in the
case and evidence counsel intends to offer which the counsel believes in good faith will be
available and admissible. It is unprofessional conduct to allude to any evidence unless there is a
good faith and reasonable basis for believing such evidence will be tendered and admitted into
evidence.

DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 502(d)(6); Rule 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal; and Rule 3.4, Fairness to
Opposing Party and Counsel.

Standard 4-7.5. Presentation of Evidence
(a) It is unprofessional conduct for a defense counsel knowingly to offer false evidence, whether
by documents, tangible evidence, or the testimony of witnesses, or fail to take reasonable
remedial measures upon discovery of its falsity.
(b) It is unprofessional conduct for a defense counsel knowingly and for the purpose of bringing
inadmissible matter to the attention of the military judge or court members to offer inadmissible
evidence, ask legally objectionable questions, or make other impermissible comments or
arguments in the presence of the military judge or court members.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            315


(c) It is unprofessional conduct to permit any tangible evidence to be displayed in the view of the
military judge or court members which would tend to prejudice fair consideration of the case by
the military judge or members until such time as a good faith tender of such evidence is made.
(d) It is unprofessional conduct to tender tangible evidence in the presence of the military judge
or court members if it would tend to prejudice fair consideration of the case, unless there is a
reasonable basis for its admission in evidence. When there is any substantial doubt about the
admissibility of such evidence, it should be tendered by an offer of proof and a ruling obtained.

DISCUSSION
In a trial before members, when defense counsel has reason to anticipate an objection to certain
evidence, the evidence should be offered in an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session outside the
members’ presence. See M.R.E. 103(c); Rule 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal; Rule 3.4,
Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel; and Rule 3.5, Impartiality and Decorum of the
Tribunal.

Standard 4-7.6. Examination of Witnesses
(a) The interrogation of all witnesses should be conducted fairly, objectively, and with due
regard for the dignity and legitimate privacy of the witness, and without seeking to intimidate or
humiliate the witness unnecessarily.
(b) A defense counsel’s belief or knowledge that the witness is telling the truth does not preclude
cross- examination.
(c) A defense counsel should not call a witness in the presence of the members who the lawyer
knows will claim a valid privilege not to testify.
(d) It is unprofessional conduct for a defense counsel to ask a question which implies the
existence of a factual predicate for which a good faith belief is lacking.

DISCUSSION
See M.R.E. 104; Rule 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal; Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party
and Counsel; and Rule 3.5, Impartiality and Decorum of the Tribunal.

Standard 4-7.7. Argument to the Court Members
(a) In closing argument to the court members, the defense counsel may argue all reasonable
inferences from the evidence in the record. It is unprofessional conduct for a defense counsel
intentionally to misstate the evidence or mislead the court members as to the inferences it may
draw.
(b) It is unprofessional conduct for a defense counsel to express a personal belief or opinion in
the accused’s innocence or personal belief or opinion in the truth or falsity of any testimony or
evidence.
(c) A defense counsel should not make arguments calculated to appeal to the prejudices of the
court members.
(d) A defense counsel should refrain from argument which would divert the court members from
their duty to decide the case on the evidence.
(e) [Added] It is the responsibility of the military judge to ensure that final argument to the court
members is kept within proper, accepted bounds.

DISCUSSION
Closing arguments on findings are regulated by R.C.M. 919. Sentencing arguments are
 316                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


controlled by R.C.M. 1001(g). Subsection (d) should be read as to apply to arguments on
findings. Defense counsel may argue broader issues and the consequences of the conviction
during sentencing arguments within the context of the appropriate purposes of sentencing. See
Rules 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal; 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel; and 3.5,
Impartiality and Decorum of the Tribunal. Compare Standard 3-5.8.

Standard 4-7.8. Facts Outside the Record
It is unprofessional conduct for a defense counsel intentionally to refer to or argue on the basis of
facts outside the record whether at trial or on appeal, unless such facts are matters of common
public knowledge based on ordinary human experience or matters of which a court can take
judicial notice.

DISCUSSION
See Rule 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal; Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel;
and M.R.E. 201 and 201A.

Standard 4-7.9. Post-Trial Motions
The trial defense counsel’s responsibility includes presenting appropriate motions, after findings
and before sentence, to protect the accused’s rights.

DISCUSSION
Examples include, but are not limited to, motions to hold charges multiplicious for sentencing
and motions for pretrial confinement credit, etc.

Standard 4-7.10. False Testimony by the Accused [Added]
(a) If the accused has admitted to defense counsel facts which establish guilt and counsel’s
independent investigation has established that the admissions are true, but the accused insists on
the right to trial, counsel must discourage the accused from taking the witness stand to testify
falsely.
(b) If, in advance of trial, the accused insists that he or she will take the stand to testify falsely,
the defense counsel may withdraw from the case, if that is feasible, seeking leave of the court if
necessary, but the court should not be advised of counsel’s reason for seeking to do so.
(c) If withdrawal from the case is not feasible or is not permitted by the court, or if the situation
arises immediately preceding trial or during the trial and the accused insists upon testifying
falsely in his or her own behalf, it is unprofessional conduct for the defense counsel to lend aid to
the perjury or use the perjured testimony. Before the accused takes the stand in these
circumstances, the defense counsel should make a record of the fact that the accused is taking the
stand against the advice of counsel in some appropriate manner. The defense counsel may
identify the witness as the accused and may ask appropriate questions of the accused when it is
believed that the accused’s answers will not be perjurious. As to matters for which it is believed
that the accused will offer perjurious testimony, counsel should not conduct direct examination.
A defense counsel may not later argue the accused’s known false version of the facts to the court
members as worthy of belief, and may not recite or rely upon the false testimony in his or her
closing argument.
(d) [Added] In the event that the accused clearly testifies falsely on a material matter, despite
counsel’s advice and other actions to dissuade the accused from doing so, defense counsel shall
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           317


disclose the perjury to the court. In a trial by members, defense counsel should disclose the
perjury to the military judge ex parte.

DISCUSSION
Lawyers should be cautioned that the "lying client" situation is rare. These rules apply when
the lawyer knows the accused has committed perjury. Lawyers should recognize that "the most
honest witness may recall (or sincerely believe he recalls) details that he previously overlooked."

(a) and (b), the client has ultimate authority to decide whether he or she will testify. The lawyer
may not attempt to preempt the "lying client" problem by refusing to allow the client to take the
stand.

Counsel must carefully balance the obligation to preserve client confidences (Rule 1.6) and the
duty of candor to the court (Rule 3.3). Although subsection (d) requires disclosure of false
testimony to the court, counsel must be careful to limit such disclosure in order to preserve all
other client confidences.

Just as subsection (c) admonished counsel to make appropriate records before trial when the
accused will take the stand against the advice of counsel, post-trial records should be equally
clear. In a situation where counsel has been surprised by a client’s unexpected perjury on the
stand, counsel should consult the chief senior defense counsel immediately after trial and prepare
a written record for his or her files.

This section was withdrawn by the ABA Standing Committee on Association Standards for
Criminal Justice before submission to the ABA House of Delegates in 1979. It is included here,
with significant modifications, to provide needed guidelines consistent with the requirements of
Rules 1.6 and 3.3, and the guidance provided in dicta in the Supreme Court plurality decision of
Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157, 106 S.Ct. 988 (1986).


                              SECTION VIII. After Conviction

Standard 4-8.1. Sentencing
(a) The defense counsel should, at the earliest possible time, be or become familiar with the
sentencing alternatives available to the court and with community and other facilities which may
be of assistance in a plan for meeting the accused’s needs. Defense counsel’s preparation should
also include familiarization with the court’s practices in exercising sentencing discretion, the
practical consequences of different sentences, and the normal pattern of sentences for the offense
involved, including any guidelines applicable at either sentencing or parole stages. The
consequences of the various dispositions available should be explained fully by the defense
counsel to the accused.
(b) [Modified] Defense counsel should present to the court any ground which will assist in
reaching a proper disposition favorable to the accused.
(c) [Omitted]
(d) Defense counsel should alert the accused to the right of allocution and to the possible dangers
of making a judicial confession in the course of allocution which might prejudice an appeal.
 318                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


(e) [Added] Trial defense counsel should take all appropriate post-trial actions to seek relief from
the convening authority in the form of clemency or approving findings or a sentence less severe
than that adjudged. United States v. Palenius, 2 M.J. 86 (C.M.A. 1977); United States v.
Titsworth, 13 M.J. 147 (C.M.A. 1982); United States v. Goode, 1 M.J. 3 (C.M.A. 1975).

DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 1001(c).

Standard 4-8.2. Appeal
(a) After conviction, the defense counsel should explain to the accused the meaning and
consequences of the court’s judgment and the accused’s appellate rights. The defense counsel
should give the accused his or her professional judgment as to whether or not there is a
meritorious ground for appeal and as to the probable results of an appeal. The defense counsel
should also explain to the accused the advantages and disadvantages of an appeal. The decision
to withdraw a case from appellate review must be the accused’s own choice.
[(b) Omitted]

DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 1102, 1105, and 1106(f); Rule 1.4, Communication; Rule 3.1, Meritorious Claims
and Contentions; and Standard 4-5.2.

Standard 4-8.3. Counsel on Appeal
(a) Appellate defense counsel should not seek to withdraw from a case solely on the basis of his
or her own determination that the appeal lacks merit.
(b) Appellate counsel should give a client his or her best professional evaluation of the questions
that might be presented on appeal. Counsel, when inquiring into the case, should consider all
issues that might affect the validity of the judgment of conviction and sentence including any
that might require initial presentation in a post conviction proceeding. Counsel should advise on
the probable outcome of a challenge to the conviction or sentence. Counsel should endeavor to
persuade the client to abandon a wholly frivolous appeal or to eliminate contentions lacking in
substance.
(c) If the client chooses to proceed with an appeal against the advice of counsel, counsel should
present the case, so long as such advocacy does not involve deception of the court. When
counsel cannot continue without misleading the court, counsel may request permission to
withdraw.
(d) [Omitted]
(e) [Omitted]

DISCUSSION
See Rule 1.16, Declining or Terminating Representation; and United States v. Grostefon, 12 M.J.
431 (C.M.A. 1982).

Standard 4-8.4. Conduct of Appeal
(a) Appellate counsel should be diligent in perfecting an appeal and expediting its prompt
submission to the appellate court.
(b) Appellate counsel should be accurate in referring to the record and the authorities upon which
counsel relies in the presentation to the court of briefs and oral argument.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            319


(c) [Modified] It is unprofessional conduct for Appellate Counsel to intentionally refer to or
argue on the basis of facts outside the record on appeal, unless such facts are matters of common
public knowledge based on ordinary human experience, matters of which the court may take
judicial notice, or other matters that are properly before the court.

DISCUSSION
Subsection (c) was slightly modified to add other matters properly before the court. This
recognizes unique aspects of military practice such as the fact finding powers of the Air Force
Court of Criminal Appeals (Article 66(c), UCMJ), and consideration of post-trial matters such as
the Goode response and other clemency materials. See generally, Rule 1.3, Diligence; Rule 3.3,
Candor Toward the Tribunal; Rule 3.4, Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel; Rule 3.5,
Impartiality and Decorum of the Tribunal; Articles 61-67 and 70, UCMJ; R.C.M. 1202 and 1205;
United States v. Grostefon, 12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A. 1982); and Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738,
87 S.Ct. 1396 (1967).

Standard 4-8.5. Post-Conviction Remedies
After a conviction is affirmed on appeal, appellate counsel should determine whether there is any
ground for relief under other post-conviction remedies. If there is a reasonable prospect of a
favorable result, counsel should explain to the appellant the advantages and disadvantages of
taking such action. Appellate counsel is not obligated to represent the accused in a post-
conviction proceeding unless counsel has agreed to do so. In other respects, the responsibility of
a lawyer in a post-conviction proceeding should be guided generally by the standards governing
the conduct of lawyers in criminal cases.

DISCUSSION
"Post-conviction remedies" refers to remedies beyond legal appeals, such as applications to the
Board for Correction of Military Records or submissions to the Clemency and Parole Board. See
Rule 1.4, Communication; Rule 2.1, Advisor; and Rule 3.1, Meritorious Claims and Contentions.

Standard 4-8.6. Challenges to the Effectiveness of Counsel
(a) If an appellate defense counsel, after investigation, is satisfied that another defense counsel
who served in an earlier phase of the case did not provide effective assistance, he or she should
not hesitate to seek relief for the accused on that ground.
(b) If an appellate defense counsel, after investigation, is satisfied that another defense counsel
who served in an earlier phase of the case provided effective assistance, he or she should so
advise the client and may decline to proceed further.
(c) If defense counsel concludes that he or she did not provide effective assistance in an earlier
phase of the case, defense counsel should explain this conclusion to the accused and seek to
withdraw from representation with an explanation to the court of the reason therefor.
(d) Counsel whose conduct of a criminal case is drawn into question is entitled to testify
concerning the matters charged and is not precluded from disclosing the truth concerning the
accusation to the extent defense counsel reasonably believes necessary, even though this
involves revealing matters which were given in confidence.

DISCUSSION
Counsel must continue to balance the obligation to preserve client confidences against his or her
right and need to respond to allegations of ineffective assistance or misconduct. Disclosures
 320                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


must be limited in order to preserve confidences beyond the scope and unrelated to the
allegations. Subsection (b) is limited by the application of United States v. Grostefon, 12 M.J.
431 (C.M.A. 1982). See Rule 1.6, Confidentiality of Information; Rule 3.1, Meritorious Claims
and Contentions; Rule 3.7, Lawyer as Witness; Rule 4.4, Respect for Rights of Third Persons;
and Rule 8.3, Reporting Professional Misconduct.
                                          CHAPTER 3
                   SPECIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE MILITARY JUDGE

                                  SECTION I. Basic Duties

Standard 6-1.1 General Responsibility of the Military Judge
(a) The military judge has the responsibility for safeguarding both the rights of the accused and
the interests of the public in the administration of criminal justice. The adversary nature of the
proceedings does not relieve the military judge of the obligation of raising on his or her
initiative, at all appropriate times and in an appropriate manner, matters which may significantly
promote a just determination of the trial. The only purpose of a criminal trial is to determine
whether the prosecution has established the guilt of the accused as required by law, and, if
necessary, to adjudge an appropriate sentence, and the military judge should not allow the
proceedings to be used for any other purpose.
(b) The military judge should require that every proceeding before him or her be conducted with
unhurried and quiet dignity, and should aim to establish such physical surroundings as are
appropriate to the administration of justice. The military judge should give each case individual
treatment, and the judge’s decisions should be based on the particular facts of that case. The
military judge should conduct the proceedings in clear and easily understandable language, using
interpreters when necessary.
(c) The military judge should be sensitive to the important roles of the trial counsel, defense
counsel, witnesses, court members and the interests of the accused, victim and public; and the
judge’s conduct toward them should manifest professional respect, courtesy, and fairness.

DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 801(a); AFI 51-201, paragraph 1.3; ABA Code of Judicial Conduct; and Rule 3.5,
Impartiality and Decorum of the Tribunal.

Standard 6-1.2. Community Relations
(a)The military judge may promote efforts to educate the community on the operation of the
criminal justice system. However, in endeavoring to educate the community, the judge should
avoid activity which would give the appearance of impropriety or bias.
(b) The trial judge should not discuss pending or impending cases, and should avoid responding
to personal criticism or complaints about particular decisions, other than to correct factual
misrepresentation in the reporting of the ruling.

Standard 6-1.3. Adherence to Standards
The military judge should be familiar with and adhere to the canons and codes applicable to the
judiciary, the codes of professional responsibility applicable to the legal profession, and
standards concerning the proper administration of criminal justice.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            321


DISCUSSION
Since the Air Force military judge is involved in the direct enforcement of discipline, his or her
own integrity and adherence to Air Force standards of conduct and appearance must be above
reproach. United States v. Berman, 28 M.J. 615 (A.F.C.M.R. 1989). See also AFI 51-201,
paragraph 1.3.

Standard 6-1.4. Appearance, Demeanor, and Statements of the Judge The military judge’s
appearance, demeanor, and statements should reflect the dignity of the judicial office and
enhance public confidence in the administration of justice. The wearing of the judicial robe in
the courtroom will contribute to these goals.

DISCUSSION
A judge must be particularly careful that his or her demeanor, facial expressions, and tone of
voice do not convey unintended messages to the court members or other trial participants. Air
Force practice dictates that military judges will wear the black judicial robe when presiding over
open sessions of courts-martial, except under combat or field conditions.

Standard 6-1.5. Obligation To Use Court Time Effectively and Fairly
(a) The military judge has the obligation to avoid delays, continuances, and extended recesses,
except for good cause. In the matter of punctuality, the observance of scheduled court hours, and
the use of working time, the military judge should be an exemplar for all other persons engaged
in the criminal case. The judge should require punctuality and optimum use of working time
from all such persons.
(b) The military judge should respect the personal and professional demands on the lives of
counsel, the accused, court members, witnesses, and victims, and should schedule and utilize
court time remaining sensitive to these needs.

DISCUSSION
This standard again emphasizes the need for the military judge to have total control over the
proceedings. The judge must remain sensitive to the perceptions of the accused, court members,
and any spectators. If the court is recessed until a specified time, and in the interim the military
judge grants an extension to the recess, the judge should ensure that all participants in the trial
are aware of the extension and of the new time for reconvening. When the court is reconvened,
it is good practice for the judge to announce on the record the fact that an additional delay was
granted.

Standard 6-1.6. Duty To Maintain Impartiality
(a) The military judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all
activities, and should conduct himself or herself at all times in a manner that promotes public
confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. The judge should not allow military,
family, social, or other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment.
(b) During the course of official proceedings, the military judge should avoid contact or
familiarity with the accused, victims, witnesses, counsel, or members of the families of such
persons which might give the appearance of bias or partiality
(c) A military judge should not hold membership in any organization that practices invidious
discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, national origin, disability, age or sexual
orientation.
 322                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


(d) [Modified] It is the responsibility of the military judge to attempt to eliminate, both in
chambers and in the courtroom, bias or prejudice due to race, sex, religion, national origin,
disability, age, or sexual orientation.
(e) A military judge should not be influenced by actual or anticipated public criticism in his or
her actions, rulings, or decisions.

DISCUSSION
See United States v. Berman, supra.

Standard 6-1.7. Judge’s Duty Concerning Record of Judicial Proceedings
[Modified] The military judge has a duty to see that the reporter makes a true, complete, and
accurate record of all proceedings, and to ensure that events in the trial are accurately described
for the record and that all parties present in the courtroom are accounted for whenever the court
is convened or reconvened.
Standard 6-1.8. Proceedings In and Outside of the Courtroom
(a) The military judge should maintain a preference for live public proceedings with all parties
physically present.
(b) All significant proceedings, whether or not public, should be on the record. Relevant
decisions in proceedings not on the record should be reflected in the record.
(c) The military judge should place or permit counsel to place any germane matter on the record
which has not been previously recorded.
(d) When electronic procedures for transmission or recording are used, the proceedings
transmitted or recorded should reflect the decorum of the courtroom. When the right to counsel
applies, such procedures should not result in a situation where only the prosecution or defense
counsel is physically present before the judge.

Standard 6-1.9. Obligation to Perform and Circumstances Requiring Recusal
(a) The military judge should recuse himself or herself whenever the judge has any doubt as to
his or her ability to preside impartially in a criminal case or whenever the judge believes his or
her impartiality can reasonably be questioned.
(b) Military judges have an obligation to perform their judicial function and avoid recusal when
not warranted.

DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 902. A military judge must disqualify himself or herself if any of the conditions
listed in R.C.M. 902(b) exist. The military judge shall, upon motion of either party or sua
sponte, decide whether he or she is disqualified.

Standard 6-1.10. Issuance or Review of Warrants
Standard 6-1.11. Communications Concerning Prisoner Status
[All omitted]

                SECTION II. General Relations with Counsel and Witnesses

Standard 6-2.1. Ex Parte Discussions of a Pending Case
The military judge should insist that neither the trial counsel nor the defense counsel, nor any
other person, discuss a pending case with the judge ex parte, except after adequate notice to all
other parties and when authorized by law or in accordance with approved practice. The military
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           323


judge should ensure that all such ex parte communications are subsequently noted on the record.

DISCUSSION
It is acceptable, in Air Force practice, for the military judge to discuss matters with trial or
defense counsel individually which are administrative in nature, which deal with the logistics of
the trial, or which involve the control of the judge’s docket. Judges must also consider the
effect of R.C.M. 802 on ex parte discussions. See United States v. Garcia, 24 M.J. 518
(A.F.C.M.R. 1987).

Standard 6-2.2. Duty To Witnesses
The military judge should permit full and proper examination and cross-examination of
witnesses, but should require the interrogation to be conducted fairly and objectively and with
due regard for the dignity and legitimate privacy of the witnesses

Standard 6-2.3. Duty To Control Length and Scope of Examination
The military judge should permit reasonable latitude to counsel in the examination and cross-
examination of witnesses, but should not permit unreasonable repetition or permit counsel to
pursue clearly irrelevant lines of inquiry.

DISCUSSION
The members may request and the military judge may require that a witness be recalled, or that a
new witness be summoned, or other evidence produced. The members or military judge may
direct trial counsel to produce additional evidence. See M.R.E. 614. In taking such action, the
court must not depart from an impartial role. See also United States v. Stroup, 29 M.J. 224
(C.M.A. 1989); United States v Lents, 32 M.J. 636 (A.C.M.R. 1991).

Standard 6-2.4. Duty of Judge on Counsel’s Objections and Requests for Rulings
The military judge should respect the obligation of counsel to present objections to procedures
and to the admissibility of evidence, to request rulings on motions, to make offers of proof, and
to have the record show adverse rulings and reflect conduct of the judge which counsel considers
prejudicial. Counsel should be permitted to state succinctly the grounds of his or her objections
or requests; but the judge should nevertheless control the length, manner and timing of argument.

Standard 6-2.5. Duty of Judge to Respect Privileges
The military judge should respect the obligation of counsel to refrain from speaking on
privileged matters and should avoid putting counsel in a position where counsel’s adherence to
the obligation, such as by a refusal to answer, may tend to prejudice the client. Unless the
privilege is waived or is otherwise inapplicable, the military judge should not request counsel to
comment on evidence or other matters where counsel’s knowledge is likely to be gained from
privileged communications.

DISCUSSION
See Discussion, Standard 4-7.7.

Standard 6-2.6. Duty to Court Members
(a) The military judge has the responsibility to treat the court members with dignity. This
includes the responsibility both to inform the court members of anticipated scheduling and to
assure that the court members have an opportunity to deliberate on a reasonable schedule. The
 324                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


military judge should also endeavor to assure that the court members have comfortable
surroundings.
(b) The military judge should conduct the trial in such a way as to enhance the court members’
ability to understand the proceedings and to perform its fact-finding function.

                     SECTION III. Maintaining Order in the Courtroom

Standard 6-3.1. Special Rules for Order in the Courtroom
The military judge, preferably before a criminal trial or at its beginning, should prescribe and
make known the ground rules relating to conduct which the parties, the trial counsel, the defense
counsel, the witnesses, and others will be expected to follow in the courtroom, and which are not
set forth in the MCM or in the published rules of court.

DISCUSSION
The presiding military judge has the ultimate authority as to procedures to be followed in an
individual court-martial.

Standard 6-3.2 Security in Court Facilities
The military judge should endeavor to maintain secure court facilities. In order to protect the
dignity and decorum in the courtroom, this should be accomplished in the least obtrusive and
disruptive manner, with an effort made to minimize any adverse impact.

Standard 6-3.3. Colloquy between Counsel
The military judge should make known before trial that no colloquy, argument, or discussion
directly between counsel in the presence of the judge or court members will be permitted on
matters relating to the case, except that, if a brief conference between counsel might tend to
expedite the trial, the judge will grant them leave to confer.

Standard 6-3.4. Courtroom Demeanor
(a) The military judge should be a model of dignity and impartiality. The judge should exercise
restraint over his or her conduct and utterances. The judge should remain neutral regarding the
proceedings at all times, suppress personal predilections, control his or her temper and emotions,
and be patient, respectful, and courteous to defendants, court members, witnesses, victims,
lawyers, and others with whom the military judge deals in an official capacity. The military
judge should not permit any person in the courtroom to embroil him or her in conflict, and
should otherwise avoid personal conduct which tends to demean the proceedings or to undermine
judicial authority in the courtroom.
(b) The military judge should require similar conduct of staff, court officials and others subject to
the military judge’s direction and control.

Standard 6-3.5. Judge’s Use of Powers to Maintain Order
(a) The military judge should maintain order and decorum in judicial proceedings. The military
judge has the obligation to use his or her judicial power to prevent distractions from and
disruptions of the trial.
(b) When it becomes necessary during the trial for the military judge to comment upon the
conduct of witnesses, spectators, counsel, or others, or upon the testimony, the military judge
should do so outside the presence of the court members, if possible. Any such comment should
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             325


be in a firm, dignified, and restrained manner, avoiding repartee, limiting comments and rulings
to what is reasonably required for the orderly progress of the trial, and refraining from
unnecessary disparagement of persons or issues.

Standard 6-3.6. The Accused’s Election to Represent Himself or Herself at Trial
(a) An accused should be permitted, at the accused’s election, to proceed in his or her trial
without the assistance of counsel only after the military judge makes thorough inquiry and is
satisfied that the accused:
        (i) has been clearly advised of the right to the assistance of counsel, including the right to
the assignment of counsel when the accused is so entitled;
        (ii) is capable of understanding the proceedings; and
        (iii) has made an intelligent and voluntary waiver of the right to counsel.
(b) When a litigant undertakes to represent himself or herself, the court should take whatever
measures may be reasonable and necessary to ensure a fair trial.

DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 506(d), regarding waiver of the right to counsel by the accused. The military judge
may grant the request after pointing out to the accused that he or she has no legal training, that
there are dangers and disadvantages in failing to raise motions and objections in a timely fashion
and in conducting improper examination and cross-examination of witnesses, and that no special
consideration can be granted merely because the accused proceeds pro se. See also United
States v. Beatty, 25 M.J. 311 (C.M.A. 1987); United States v. Bowie, 21 M.J. 453 (C.M.A. 1986),
cert. denied 107 S.Ct. 8 (1987).

Standard 6-3.7. Standby Counsel for Pro Se Accused
(a) When an accused has been permitted to proceed without the assistance of counsel, the
military judge should consider the appointment of standby counsel to assist the accused when
called upon. Standby counsel should always be appointed in capital cases and in cases when the
maximum penalty is life without the possibility of parole. Standby counsel should ordinarily be
appointed in cases expected to be long or complicated, or in which there are multiple accused,
and in any case in which a severe sentence might be imposed.
(b) The military judge should clearly notify both the defendant and standby counsel of their
respective roles and duties.
(c) When standby counsel is appointed to provide assistance to the pro se accused only when
requested, the military judge should ensure that counsel not actively participate in the conduct of
the defense unless requested by the accused or directed to do so by the court. When standby
counsel is appointed to actively assist the pro se accused, the military judge should ensure that
the accused is permitted to make final decisions on all matters, including strategic and tactical
matters relating to the conduct of the case.

DISCUSSION
The standby counsel must be certified under Article 27(b), UCMJ, and may remain at the
counsel table available to assist the accused throughout the trial. See United States v. Beatty and
United States v. Bowie, both supra.


Standard 6-3.8. The Disruptive Accused
 326                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


An accused may be removed from the courtroom during trial when the accused’s conduct is so
disruptive that the trial cannot proceed in an orderly manner. Removal is preferable to gagging
or shackling the disruptive accused. If removed, the accused should be required to be present in
the court building while the trial is in progress. The removed accused should be afforded an
opportunity to hear the proceedings and, at appropriate intervals, be offered on the record an
opportunity to return to the courtroom upon assurance of good behavior. The offer to return
need not be repeated in open court each time. A removed accused who does not hear the
proceedings should be given the opportunity to learn of the proceedings from defense counsel at
reasonable intervals.

DISCUSSION
Trial may proceed without the presence of an accused who has disrupted a court-martial, but
only after at least one warning by the military judge that such behavior may result in removal
from the courtroom. The record of trial must clearly reflect the reasons for removing the
accused. See R.C.M. 804(b), Discussion. Disruptive behavior of the accused may also constitute
contempt. See R.C.M. 809.

Standard 6-3.9. Misconduct of Pro Se Accused
If an accused who is permitted to proceed without the assistance of counsel engages in conduct
which is so disruptive, including disobeying or failing to respond to judicial orders or rulings,
that the trial cannot proceed in an orderly manner, the court should, after appropriate warnings,
revoke the permission and require representation by counsel. If standby counsel has previously
been appointed, the counsel should be asked to represent the accused. When appropriate, the trial
should be recessed only long enough for counsel to make the necessary preparations to go
forward with the trial.

DISCUSSION
The right of the military accused to proceed pro se may be revoked if the accused is disruptive or
fails to follow basic rules of decorum and practice. See R.C.M. 506(d) and R.C.M. 804.

Standard 6-3.10. Misconduct of Spectators and Others
(a) Any person who engages in conduct which disturbs the orderly process of the trial may be
admonished or excluded, and, if such conduct is intentional, may be punished for contempt. Any
person whose conduct in a criminal proceeding tends to menace the accused, an attorney, a
victim, a witness, a juror, a court officer, the military judge, or a member of the accused’s or
victim’s family may be removed from the courtroom.
(b) When a victim or a member of a victim’s or an accused’s family is removed from the
courtroom during trial, he or she should ordinarily be allowed to return upon assurance of good
behavior.

DISCUSSION See R.C.M. 806.

Standard 6-3.11. Lawyers from Other Jurisdictions [Omitted]

                         SECTION IV. Use of the Contempt Power

Standard 6-4.1. Power to Impose Sanctions
The court has the inherent power to protect the integrity and fair administration of the criminal
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             327


justice process by imposing sanctions. The military judge has the power to cite and, if necessary,
punish summarily anyone who, in the judge’s presence in open court, willfully obstructs the
course of criminal proceedings.

DISCUSSION
See Article 48, UCMJ, and R.C.M. 809(a) and its discussion for procedures and limitations on
the contempt power in military practice. See also United States v. Burnett, 27 M.J. 99 (C.M.A.
1988).

Standard 6-4.2. Imposition of Sanctions
If the military judge determines to impose sanctions for misconduct affecting the trial, the
military judge should ordinarily impose the lease severe sanctions appropriate to correct the
abuse and deter repetition and should do so outside the presence of the court members, if
possible. In weighing the severity of the possible sanction for disruptive courtroom conduct to
be applied during the trial, the military judge should consider the risk of further disruption, delay,
or prejudice that might result from the character of the sanction or the time of its imposition.

Standard 6-4.3. The Sanction of Contempt
The sanction of contempt should not be imposed by the military judge unless:
(a) it is clear from the identity of the offender and the character of his or her acts that the
disruptive conduct was willfully contemptuous; or
(b) the conduct warranting such sanction was preceded by a clear warning that such conduct was
impermissible and that specified sanctions might be imposed for its repetition.

Standard 6-4.4. Notice of Intent to Use Contempt Power; Postponement of Adjudication
(a) The military judge should, as soon as practicable after he or she is satisfied that courtroom
misconduct requires contempt proceedings, inform the alleged offender of the judge’s intention
to institute such proceedings.
(b) The military judge should consider deferring adjudication of contempt for courtroom
misconduct of an accused, an attorney, or a witness until after the trial, and should defer such a
proceeding unless prompt punishment is imperative.

DISCUSSION
See Burnett, supra.

Standard 6-4.5. Notice of Nature of the Conduct and Opportunity to Be Heard
Before imposing any punishment for criminal contempt, the military judge should give the
offender notice of the nature of the conduct and at least a summary opportunity to adduce
evidence or argument relevant to guilt or punishment.

Standard 6-4.6. Imposition of Sanctions and Referral to Another Judge
The judge before whom courtroom misconduct occurs may impose appropriate sanctions,
including punishment for contempt, but should refer the matter to another judge whenever the
presiding judge has any doubt about his or her ability to preside over the matter impartially, or if
the presiding judge’s objectivity can reasonably be questioned.

                        SECTION I. Conduct of Lawyers in Criminal Cases.
Standard 8-1.1. Extrajudicial Statements by Lawyers
(a) A lawyer should not make or authorize the making of an extrajudicial statement that a
reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication if the
lawyer knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial likelihood of prejudicing
a criminal proceeding.
(b) Statements relating to the following matters are ordinarily likely to have a substantial
likelihood of prejudicing a criminal proceeding:
         (1) the prior criminal record (including arrests, indictments, or other charges or crime) of
a suspect or accused;
         (2) the character or reputation of a suspect or accused;
         (3) the opinion of the lawyer on the guilt of the accused, the merits of the case or the
merits of the evidence in the case;
         (4) the existence or contents of any confession, admission, or statement given by the
accused, or the refusal or failure of the accused to make a statement;
         (5) the performance of any examinations or tests, or the accused’s refusal or failure to
submit to an examination or test, or the identity or nature of physical evidence expected to be
presented;
         (6) the identity, expected testimony, criminal records, or credibility of prospective
witnesses;
         (7) the possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged, or other disposition; and
         (8) information which the lawyer knows or has reason to know would be inadmissible as
evidence in a trial.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b), statements relating to the following matters may be
made:
         (1) the general nature of the charges against the accused, provided that there is included
therein a statement explaining that the charge is merely an accusation and that the accused is
presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty;
         (2) the general nature of the defense to the charges or to other public accusations against
the accused, including that the accused has no prior criminal record;
         (3) the name, age, residence, occupation, and family status of the accused;
         (4) information necessary to aid in the apprehension of the accused or to warn the public
of any dangers that may exist;
         (5) a request for assistance in obtaining evidence;
         (6) the existence of an investigation in progress, including the general length and scope of
the investigation, the charge or defense involved, and the identity of the investigating officer or
agency;
         (7) the facts and circumstances of an arrest, including the time and place, and the identity
of the arresting officer or agency;
         (8) the identity of the victim, where the release of that information is not otherwise
prohibited by law or would not be harmful to the victim;
         (9) information contained within a public record, without further comment; and
         (10) the scheduling or result of any stage in the judicial process.
(d) Nothing in this standard is intended to preclude the formulation or application of more
restrictive rules relating to the release of information about juvenile offenders, to preclude the
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            329


holding of hearings or the lawful issuance of reports by legislative, administrative, or
investigative bodies, to preclude any lawyer from replying to charges of misconduct that are
publicly made against him or her, or to preclude or inhibit any lawyer from making an otherwise
permissible statement which serves to educate or inform the public concerning the operations of
the criminal justice system.

DISCUSSION
Ordinarily, the general nature of a defense to the charges in Standard 8-1.1(c)2 should only be
given by defense personnel.
Standard 8-1.2. Rule of Court [Omitted]

                  SECTION II. The Conduct of Law Enforcement Officers,
                      Judges, and Court Personnel in Criminal Cases

Standard 8-2.1. Release of Information by Law Enforcement Agencies
(a) The provisions of Standard 8-1.1 are applicable to the release of information to the public by
law enforcement officers and agencies.
(b) Law enforcement officers and agencies should not exercise their custodial authority over an
accused individual in a manner that is likely to result in either:
        (1) the deliberate exposure of a person in custody for the purpose of photographing or
televising by representatives of the news media; or
        (2) the interviewing by representatives of the news media of a person in custody, except
upon request or consent by that person to an interview after being informed adequately of the
right to consult with counsel and of the right to refuse to grant an interview.
(c) Nothing in this standard is intended to preclude any law enforcement officer or agency from
replying to charges of misconduct that are publicly made against him or her or from participating
in any legislative, administrative, or investigative hearing, nor is this standard intended to
supersede more restrictive rules governing the release of information concerning juvenile
offenders.

Standard 8-2.2. Disclosures by Court Personnel
Court personnel shall not disclose to any unauthorized person information relating to a pending
criminal case that is not part of the public records of the court and that may be prejudicial to the
right of the United States or the accused to a fair trial.

DISCUSSION
AFI 51-201, Chapter 13, Section D sets out the information which may be provided to the media.

Standard 8-2.3. Conduct of Military Judges
Military judges should refrain from any conduct or the making of any statements that may be
prejudicial to the right of the United States or of the accused to a fair trial.

DISCUSSION
Military judges will refer all press requests received by them to the servicing SJA and the
installation public affairs officer.

           SECTION III. The Conduct of Judicial Proceedings in Criminal Cases

Standard 8-3.1. Prohibition of Direct Restraints on Media
Absent a clear and present danger to the fairness of a trial or other compelling interest, no rule of
court or judicial order should be promulgated that prohibits representatives of the news media
from broadcasting or publishing any information in their possession relating to a criminal case.

Standard 8-3.2. Public Access to Judicial Proceedings and Related Documents and
Exhibits
[Omitted]

Standard 8-3.3. Change of Venue or Continuance [Omitted]

Standard 8-3.4. Severance
In cases in which there is a substantial likelihood that one or more of the accused will not receive
a fair trial because of potentially prejudicial publicity against another accused, the court shall
grant severance on motion of either the prosecution or the defense.

Standard 8-3.5. Selecting the Court Members
The following standards govern the selection of a court panel in those criminal cases in which
questions of possible prejudice are raised.
(a) [Modified] If there is a substantial possibility that individual court members will be ineligible
to serve because of exposure to potentially prejudicial material, the examination of each member
with respect to exposure shall take place outside the presence of other chosen and prospective
court members. An accurate record of this examination shall be kept by the court reporter. The
questioning shall be conducted for the purpose of determining what the prospective court
member has read and heard about the case and how any exposure has affected that person’s
attitude toward the trial, not to convince the prospective member that an inability to cast aside
any preconceptions would be a dereliction of duty.
[(b) through (d) omitted]

DISCUSSION
Grounds for challenge for cause of a court member are included in R.C.M. 912(f). An accurate
record of voir dire proceedings will automatically be obtained in Air Force practice, since a
sworn court reporter must record all open sessions of the trial.

Standard 8-3.6. Conduct of the Trial
The following standards govern the conduct of a criminal trial when problems relating to the
dissemination of potentially prejudicial materials are raised.
(a) Whenever appropriate, in view of the notoriety of a case or the number or conduct of news
media representatives present at any judicial proceeding, the court shall ensure the preservation
of decorum by instructing those representatives and others as to the permissible use of the
courtroom and other facilities of the court, the assignment of seats to news media representatives
on an equitable basis, and other matters that may affect the conduct of the proceeding.
[(b) through (c) omitted]
(d) In any case that appears likely to be of significant public interest, an admonition in
substantially the following instruction shall be given before the end of the first day if the court
members are not sequestered:
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            331


During the time you serve on this court-martial panel, there may appear in the newspapers or on
radio or television reports concerning this case, and you may be tempted to read, listen to, or
watch them. Please do not do so. Due process of law requires that the evidence to be considered
by you in reaching your findings meet certain standards; for example, a witness may testify about
events personally seen or heard but not about matters told to the witness by others. Also,
witnesses must be sworn to tell the truth and must be subject to these standards, and if you read,
listen to, or watch these reports, you may be exposed to information which unduly favors one
side and to which the other side is unable to respond. In fairness to both sides, therefore, it is
essential that you comply with this instruction. If the process of selecting a court-martial panel is
a lengthy one, an admonition shall also be given to each member as he or she is selected. At the
end of each day of the trial, and at other recess periods if the court deems necessary, an
admonition in substantially the following form shall be given: For the reasons stated earlier in
the court-martial, I must remind you not to read, listen to, or watch any news reports concerning
this case while you are serving on this court.
(e) [Omitted]

DISCUSSION
Since Air Force court panels are not sequestered, it is necessary for the military judge to be
sensitive to the possibility of exposure of the court members to information about the case from
various news media, and instructions such as the ones in this standard would be necessary in
appropriate cases. The members are usually instructed that, if they become aware of information
about the case from sources other than evidence properly admitted at trial, they must
immediately inform the military judge, so that an inquiry may be conducted to determine their
suitability for further service on the panel.

Standard 8.3.7. Setting Aside the Verdict [Omitted]

Standard 8.3.8. Broadcasting, Televising, Recording and Photographing Courtroom
Proceedings [Omitted]

                  DISCOVERY AND PROCEDURE BEFORE TRIAL

                               SECTION I. General Principles

Standard 11-1.1. Objectives of Pretrial Procedures
(a) Procedure prior to trial should, consistent with the constitutional rights of the accused:
        (i) promote a fair and expeditious disposition of the charge, whether by diversion, plea, or
trial;
        (ii) provide the accused with sufficient information to make an informed plea;
        (iii) permit thorough preparation for trial and minimize surprise at trial;
        (iv) reduce interruptions and complications during trial and avoid unnecessary and
repetitious trials by identifying and resolving prior to trial any procedural, collateral, or
constitutional issues;
        (v) minimize the procedural and substantive inequities among similarly situated accused;
and
        (vi) effect economies in time, money, judicial resources, and professional skills by
minimizing paperwork, avoiding repetitious assertions of issues, and reducing the number of
 332                                                                       AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


separate hearings; and
       (vii) minimize the burden upon victims and witnesses
(b) These needs can be served by:
       (i) full and free exchange of appropriate discovery;
       (ii) simpler and more efficient procedures; and
       (iii) Procedural pressures for expediting the processing of cases.

Standard 11-1.2. Applicability
[Modified] These standards should be applied in all criminal cases.

DISCUSSION
In military practice, discovery standards apply in all courts-martial.

Standard 11-1.3. Definition of “Statement”
(a) When used in these standards, a “written statement” of a person shall include:
        (i) any statement in writing that is made, signed, or adopted by that person; and
        (ii) the substance of a statement of any kind made by that person that is embodied or
summarized in any writing or recording, whether or not specifically signed or adopted by that
person. The term is intended to include statements contained in police or investigative reports,
but does not include attorney work product.
(b) When used in these standards, an “oral statement” of a person shall mean the substance of
any statement of any kind by that person, whether or not reflected in any existing writing or
recording.

             SECTION II. Discovery Obligations of the Prosecution and Defense

Standard 11-2.1. Prosecutorial Disclosure
(a) The trial counsel should, within a specified and reasonable time prior to trial, disclose to the
defense the following information and material and permit inspection, copying, testing, and
photographing of disclosed documents or tangible objects:
          (i) All written and all oral statements of the accused or co-accused that are within the
possession or control of the prosecution and that relate to the subject matter of the offense
charged, and any documents relating to the acquisition of such statements.
          (ii) The names and addresses of all persons known to the prosecution to have information
concerning the offense charged, together with all written statements of any such person that are
within the possession or control of the prosecution and that relate to the subject matter of the
offense charged. The prosecution should also identify the persons it intends to call as witnesses
at trial.
          (iii) The relationship, if any, between the prosecution and any witness it intends to call at
trial, including the nature and circumstances of any agreement, understanding or representation
between the prosecution and the witness that constitutes an inducement for the cooperation or
testimony of the witness.
          (iv) [Modified] Any reports or written statements of experts made in connection with the
case, including results of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests, experiments, or
comparisons. With respect to each expert whom the prosecution intends to call as a witness at
trial, the prosecutor should also furnish to the defense a curriculum vitae.
          (v) Any tangible objects, including books, papers, documents, photographs, buildings,
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             333


places, or any other objects, which pertain to the case or which were obtained for or belong to the
accused. The prosecution should also identify which of these tangible objects it intends to offer
as evidence at trial.
         (vi) [Modified] Any record of prior criminal convictions, pending charges, or
probationary status of the accused or any co-accused.
         (vii) Any material, documents, or information relating to lineups, soups, and picture or
voice identifications in relation to the case.
         (viii) Any material or information within the prosecutor’s possession or control which
tends to negate the guilt of the accused as to the offense charged or which would tend to reduce
the punishment of the accused.
(b) If the trial counsel intends to use character, reputation, or other act evidence, the prosecution
should notify the defense of that intention and of the substance of the evidence to be used.
(c) If the accused’s conversations or premises have been subjected to electronic surveillance
(including wiretapping) in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case, the trial
counsel should inform the defense of that fact.
(d) If any tangible object which the trial counsel intends to offer at trial was obtained through a
search and seizure, the trial counsel should disclose to the defense any information, documents,
or other material relating to the acquisition of such objects.

DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 701 and its Discussion. See also Rule 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal; Rule 3.4,
Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel; and Rule 3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Trial
Counsel.

Discovery under military law is generally broader and more direct than in most civilian courts.
See United States v. Mougenel, 6 M.J. 589 (A.F.C.M.R. 1978).

Article 46, UCMJ, provides that the prosecution and defense shall have equal opportunity to
obtain witnesses and other evidence, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed
Forces has interpreted Article 46 to mean that "the defense is entitled to equal access to all
evidence, whether or not it is apparently exculpatory." United States v. Garries, 22 M.J. 288,
293 (C.M.A. 1986); United States v. Reece, 25 M.J. 93 (C.M.A. 1987). See also R.C.M. 703(f).

Standard 11-2.2. Defense Disclosure
(a) The defense should, within a specified and reasonable time prior to trial, disclose to the
prosecution the following information and material and permit inspection, copying, testing, and
photographing of disclosed documents and tangible objects:
        (i) The names and addresses of all witnesses (other than the accused) whom the defense
intends to call at trial, together with all written statements of any such witness that are within the
possession or control of the defense and that relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the
witness. Disclosure of the identity and statements of a person who will be called for the sole
purpose of impeaching a prosecution witness should not be required until after the prosecution
witness has testified at trial.
        (ii) [Modified] Any reports or written statements made in connection with the case by
experts whom the defense intends to call at trial, including the results of physical or mental
examinations and of scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons that the accused intends to
offer as evidence at trial. For each such expert witness, the defense should also furnish to the
 334                                                                       AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


trial counsel a curriculum vitae.
         (iii) Any tangible objects, including books, papers, documents, photographs, buildings,
places or any other objects, which the defense intends to introduce as evidence at trial.
(b) If the defense intends to use character, reputation, or other act evidence not relating to the
accused, the defense should notify the prosecution of that intention and of the substance of the
evidence to be used.
(c) [Modified] If the defense intends to rely upon a defense of alibi, innocent ingestion or lack of
mental responsibility, the defense should notify the prosecution of that intent and of the names of
the witnesses who may be called in support of that defense.

DISCUSSION
See R.C.M. 701 and its Discussion.

Standard 11-3.1. Obtaining Nontestimonial Information from Third Parties [Omitted]

Standard 11-3.2. Preservation of Evidence and Testing or Evaluation by Experts
(a) If either party intends to destroy or transfer out of its possession any objects or information
otherwise discoverable under these standards, the party should give notice to the other party
sufficiently in advance to afford that party an opportunity to object or take other appropriate
action.
(b) Upon motion, either party should be permitted to conduct evaluations or tests of physical
evidence in the possession or control of the other party which is subject to disclosure. The
motion should specify the nature of the test or evaluation to be conducted, the names and
qualifications of the experts designated to conduct evaluations or tests, and the material upon
which such tests will be conducted. The court may make such orders as are necessary to make
the material to be tested or examined available to the designated expert.
         (i) The court should condition its order so as to preserve the integrity of the material to be
tested or evaluated.
         (ii) If the material is contraband material or a controlled substance, the entity having
custody of the material may elect to have a representative present during the testing of the
material.


                        SECTION IV. Timing and Manner of Disclosure

Standard 11-4.1. Timely Performance of Disclosure
(a) [Omitted]
(b) [Omitted]
(c) Each party should be under a continuing obligation to produce discoverable material to the
other side. If, subsequent to compliance with these standards or orders pursuant thereto, a party
discovers additional material or information which is subject to disclosure, the other party should
promptly be notified of the existence of such additional material. If the additional material or
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             335


information is discovered during or after trial, the court should also be notified.

Standard 11-4.2. Manner of Performing Disclosure
Disclosure may be accomplished in any manner mutually agreeable to the parties. Absent
agreement, the party having the burden of production should:
(a) notify opposing counsel that material and information, described in general terms, may be
inspected, obtained, tested, copied, or photographed during specified reasonable times; and
(b) make available to opposing counsel at the time specified such material and information and
suitable facilities or other arrangements for inspection, testing, copying, and photographing of
such material and information.

Standard 11-4.3. Obligation to Obtain Discoverable Material
(a) The obligations of the trial counsel and of the defense attorney under these standards extend
to material and information in the possession or control of members of the attorney’s staff and of
any others who either regularly report to or, with reference to the particular case, have reported
to the attorney’s office.
(b) The trial counsel should make reasonable efforts to ensure that material and information
relevant to the defendant and the offense charged is provided by investigative personnel to the
trial counsel’s office.
(c) If the trial counsel is aware that information which would be discoverable if in the possession
of the prosecution is in the possession or control of a government agency not reporting directly to
the trial counsel, the trial counsel should disclose the fact of the existence of such information to
the defense.
(d) Upon a party’s request for, and designation of, material or information which would be
discoverable if in the possession or control of the other party and which is in the possession or
control of the others, the party from whom the material is requested should use diligent good
faith efforts to cause such material to be made available to the opposing party. If the party’s
efforts are unsuccessful and such material or others are subject to the jurisdiction of the court, the
court should issue suitable subpoenas or orders to cause such material to be made available to the
party making the request.
(e) Upon a showing that items not covered in the foregoing standards are material to the
preparation of the case, the court may order disclosure of the specified material or information.




                                    SECTION V. Depositions

Standard 11-5.1. Depositions to Perpetuate Testimony [Omitted].]

Standard 11-5.2. Discovery Depositions [Omitted]

                     Section VI. General Provisions Governing Discovery

Standard 11-6.1. Restrictions on Disclosure
(a) Disclosure should not be required of legal research or of records, correspondence, reports, or
 336                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


memoranda to the extent that they contain the opinions, theories, or conclusions of the trial
counsel or defense counsel, or members of the attorney’s legal staff.
(b) Disclosure of an informant’s identity should not be required where such identity is a
government secret and where a failure to disclose will not infringe on the constitutional right of
the accused. Disclosure should not be denied regarding witnesses or material to be produced at a
hearing or trial.
(c) [Modified] The court may deny, delay, or otherwise condition discovery under this Section of
the standards if it finds that there is a substantial risk of grave prejudice to national security
resulting from such disclosure, and where a failure to disclose will not infringe on the
constitutional rights of the accused.
(d) Disclosure should not be required from the defense of any communications of the defendant,
or any other materials which are protected from disclosure by the Constitution, statutes or other
law.
(e) The court should have the authority to deny, delay, or otherwise condition disclosure
authorized by these standards if it finds that there is a substantial risk to any person of physical
harm, intimidation, or bribery resulting from such disclosure which outweighs any usefulness of
the disclosure.

Standard 11-6.2. Failure of a Party to Use Disclosed Material at Trial
The fact that a party has indicated during the discovery process an intention to offer specified
evidence or to call a specified witness is not admissible in evidence at a hearing or trial.

Standard 11-6.3. Investigations Not to Be Impeded
Neither the counsel for the parties nor other prosecution or defense personnel should advise
persons (other than the accused) who have relevant material or information to refrain from
discussing the case with opposing counsel or showing opposing counsel any relevant material,
nor should they otherwise impede opposing counsel’s investigation of the case.

Standard 11-6.4. Custody of Materials
Any materials furnished to an attorney pursuant to these standards should be used only for the
purposes of preparation and trial of the case, and should be subject to such other terms and
conditions as the court may provide.

Standard 11-6.5. Protective Orders
Upon a showing of cause, the court may at any time order that specified disclosures be restricted,
conditioned upon compliance with protective measures, or deferred, or make such other order as
is appropriate, provided that all material and information to which a party is entitled is disclosed
in sufficient time to permit counsel to make beneficial use of the disclosure.

Standard 11-6.6. Excision
When some parts of material or information are discoverable under these standards and other
parts are not discoverable, the discoverable parts should be disclosed. The disclosing party
should give notice that nondiscoverable parts have been withheld and the nondiscoverable parts
should be sealed, preserved in the records of the court, and made available to the appellate court
in the event of an appeal.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             337



DISCUSSION
Any issues relating to perceived abuses of discovery should be raised by a motion for appropriate
relief, prior to the entry of pleas by the accused. Otherwise, the issue may be deemed to be
waived on appeal.

Standard 11-6.7. In Camera Proceedings
Upon request of any person, the court may permit any showing of cause for denial or regulation
of disclosures, or any portion of such showing, to be made in camera. A record should be made
of both in court and in camera proceedings. Upon the entry of an order granting relief following
a showing in camera, all confidential portions of the in camera portion of the showing should be
sealed, preserved in the records of the court, and made available to the appellate court in the
event of an appeal.

                                      Section VII. Sanctions

Standard 11-7.1. Sanctions
(a) If an applicable discovery rule or an order pursuant thereto is not promptly implemented, the
court should do one or more of the following:
         (i) order the noncomplying party to permit the discovery of the material and information
not previously disclosed;
         (ii) grant a continuance;
         (iii) prohibit the party from calling a witness or introducing into evidence the material not
disclosed, subject to the accused’s right to present a defense and provided that the exclusion does
not work an injustice either to the prosecution or the defense; and/or
         (iv) enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.
(b) The court may subject counsel to appropriate sanctions, including a finding of contempt,
upon a finding that counsel willfully violated a discovery rule or order.

                                          PREAMBLE

These rules govern the trial of courts-martial within the United States Air Force. They are
intended to inform staff judge advocates, military judges, and counsel of the basic rules of
practice and to promote uniformity in courts-martial practice. The rules are not all-inclusive nor
are they intended to be.

Rule 1.1. OBJECTIVE OF THESE RULES
Pursuant to R.C.M. 108, these rules, hereinafter referred to as the “Rules of Court,” provide rules
for the conduct of Air Force general and special courts-martial and the orderly administration of
justice by setting forth the practices and procedures now followed in Air Force courts-martial.

Rule 1.2. APPLICATION OF RULES OF COURT
The Rules of Court apply to the trial of all general and special courts-martial involving Air Force
accused, including those in which military judges assigned to other Services preside. Counsel, as
Officers of the Court, are obliged to be familiar with and to comply with these rules, as well as
those contained in The Judge Advocate General’s Corps Professional Responsibility Program
(including the Air Force Rules of Professional Conduct; the Air Force Standards for Civility in
Professional Conduct; The Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice; and the TJAGD
Professional Responsibility Program), the Manual for Courts-Martial, military case law, and
applicable Department of the Air Force Instructions.

Rule 1.3. CONSTRUCTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES OF COURT

        (A) Construction: The Rules of Court will be construed so as to ensure simplicity in
procedure, fairness in administration, reduction in cost and speedy disposition of charges against
the accused. The military judge is the ultimate arbiter of fairness in the trial arena. Accordingly,
the military judge has inherent power to permit or require variations from the Rules of Court
(see, e.g., RCM 801(a)(3)).

        (B) Reporting Violations: Should any counsel, or any other person involved in the trial
process choose to report a violation of the Rules of Court, the report should be made to the
detailed trial judge through counsel. At the conclusion of the trial, the detailed trial judge will
report alleged violations to the Chief Regional Military Judge (CRMJ) and the Chief Trial Judge
(CTJ), regardless of whether action was taken by the detailed judge regarding the alleged
violation.

         (C) Enforcement by Detailed Judge: Non-compliance with the Rules of Court, in and of
itself, gives rise to no rights or remedies to the Government or the accused, and the rules will be
interpreted in this context. However, the trial judge is not restricted in granting rights or
remedies for actions which independently violate other standards applicable to trial practitioners,
i.e., rules against contempt of court, sanctions for discovery violations, or ethical violations,
solely because the conduct in question also violates the Rules of Court. In the case of violations
of the Uniform Rules of Practice Before Air Force Courts-Martial, the military judge may, upon
application of a party or sua sponte, take such action as may be warranted by the attendant
circumstances and the interests of justice. This action may include, but is not limited to,
 342                                                                       AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


addressing the alleged conduct on the record during the course of trial.

        (D) Enforcement by the CTJ or the CRMJ: Upon report of alleged violations of the
Rules of Court forwarded by the detailed military judge, the CTJ or the CRMJ may, in the case
of military counsel, forward the complaint of violation to the supervising attorney for action.
The decision to forward such complaints is within the sound discretion of the CTJ or the CRMJ,
taking into account the nature and circumstances of the alleged violation. The CTJ or the CRMJ,
or any other person, may also take other appropriate action as provided for by the Rules of Court
or other standards applicable to trial practitioners, i.e., ethical and professional standards.

                                 PRELIMINARY MATTERS

Rule 2.1. DOCKETING

         (A) Docketing of courts-martial is a judicial function. The CTJ has world-wide
responsibility for the docketing of courts-martial and detailing of military judges. The CTJ
delegates the authority to the CRMJs of Europe and the Pacific to docket courts-martial and
detail judges within their respective regions. The CTJ also delegates the authority to the Deputy
Chief Trial Judge (DCTJ) to docket cases world-wide. To assist the CTJ, the Central Docketing
Office (CDO) serves as the focal point for all court-martial docketing and detailing decisions, to
include the detailing of CONUS judges for OCONUS courts-martial.

        (B) The CDO maintains a current docket of all pending CONUS and OCONUS courts-
martial and all other forums in which a military judge has been detailed or assigned, such as
Article 32, UCMJ, investigations and administrative discharge proceedings.

Rule 2.2. NOTIFICATIONS TO CDO
To facilitate efficient docketing management, each Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) office will
immediately notify the CDO (and OCONUS CRMJ and/or detailed military judge, as
appropriate) of the following events in the manner provided:

       (A) Preferral of court-martial charges when a general court-martial (GCM) or special
court-martial (SPCM) is contemplated -- e-mail a copy of the complete charge sheet to the CDO.

       (B) Imposition of any form of pretrial restraint and any status change -- e-mail a copy of
the confinement order to the CDO.

       (C) Referral of charges to trial by GCM or SPCM -- e-mail a copy of the complete
charge sheet and all convening orders to the CDO after service of the charges on the accused.
Note: do not send the pretrial advice, court member nomination list or court member data sheets.

        (D) Chapter 4 or resignation request -- indicate whether permission to proceed to trial
will be sought, or whether trial will be directed to proceed, and notify the CDO and the detailed
judge of the action taken on the request.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            343


      (E) Withdrawal, dismissal, or other disposition short of trial -- e-mail a copy of the
convening authority action to the CDO.

       (F) Major modification of charges and specifications after referral -- e-mail a copy of the
modified charge sheet to the CDO and the detailed judge.

       (G) Other events or circumstances that might interfere with trial of a case as scheduled --
e-mail motions to delay or continue to the CDO and the detailed judge. Note: e-mail all other
motions to the detailed judge only.

OCONUS SJAs must also provide this information to their respective CRMJ.

Rule 2.3. DETAILING OR RETAINING OF COUNSEL

        (A) As soon as possible after preferral, military trial and defense counsel will provide the
CDO a written notice of detailing; civilian defense counsel will provide a written notice of
representation. The notice will contain counsel’s full name; rank and duty title (as applicable);
position (e.g., trial counsel, assistant trial counsel, detailed defense counsel, etc.); office phone
number; e-mail address and mailing address in the case of civilian counsel. In addition, civilian
counsel’s notice will identify the jurisdiction(s) in which the counsel is admitted to practice.
Upon referral, such notices constitute the formal notice of appearance of such counsel.

        (B) The detailed defense counsel has the duty to provide civilian counsel a copy of these
rules; and the Air Force Rules of Professional Conduct; the Air Force Standards for Civility in
Professional Conduct; the Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice; and TJAGC Professional
Responsibility Program.

Rule 2.4. WITHDRAWAL BY COUNSEL
Prior to referral, if counsel withdraws from the case, counsel shall notify the CDO. Any
substitute detailing or retention of counsel will be filed in accordance with Rule 2.3. After
referral, counsel may withdraw only in the following manner:

        (A) TRIAL COUNSEL. Trial counsel may not withdraw unless substitute qualified
counsel is detailed prior to or simultaneously with the relief of the withdrawing counsel. Notice
of the withdrawal and new detailing will be filed immediately with the military judge.

        (B) MILITARY DEFENSE COUNSEL. Detailed and individual military defense
counsel may not withdraw from representation of the accused without the military judge’s
approval, whether or not the accused desires to release the military counsel. If counsel seeks
permission to withdraw before the case is docketed for trial, send the request to the CDO for
action by the CTJ or DCTJ.

       (C) CIVILIAN DEFENSE COUNSEL. Civilian defense counsel may not withdraw
from representation of the accused without the military judge’s approval, whether or not the
accused desires to release the civilian counsel. Willful failure of a fee-paying client to comply
with the terms of the contract for representation may provide grounds for counsel to request to
 344                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


withdraw. The failure to pay the fee does not, however, terminate the attorney’s obligations as
an officer of the court. If counsel seeks permission to withdraw before the case is docketed for
trial, send the request to the CDO for action by the CTJ or DCTJ.

Rule 2.5. ESTABLISHING TRIAL DATES

        (A) GENERALLY. There are several factors which must be considered in setting a trial
date, to include: conflicts with docketed cases, estimated length of the trial, availability of a
military judge, witnesses, consultants, experts, local and regional or civilian counsel and court
reporter, discovery, forensic tests, medical or psychiatric evaluation, and the existence of any
pending requests for individual military counsel, discharge, resignation, or retirement in lieu of
trial. These factors should be discussed by both sides prior to calling in the case. Trials will be
scheduled to start and end on duty days, unless circumstances dictate otherwise.

        (B) POST-REFERRAL. While the Convening Authority may decide not to refer
forwarded charges to trial in any given case, the parties must be prepared to engage immediately
in the event charges are referred.

               (1) Procedure. Immediately after referral and service of the charges on the
accused, the legal office prosecuting the case will notify the CDO as outlined in Rule 2.2(C)
along with the memo at Appendix A (template located at the AF/JAT website).

                 (2) The CDO will contact the detailed counsel to request they provide their
respective schedules, the earliest date they can try the case and their estimate of how long it will
take to try the case. Military defense counsel do not need to provide the CDO a copy of their
schedule if their schedule is current in the Judiciary Docket System.

               (3) Docketing Conference.

                        a. The Clerk of Trial Courts or docketing judge will hold a docketing
conference with counsel in all cases. The docketing conference should be held within two duty
days (CDO local time) following the day of notice of referral. After determining how long
counsel estimate it will take to try the case, the Clerk of Trial Courts will set a “presumptive trial
date.” This is the earliest day that a military judge is available to try the case after the statutory
waiting period (see R.C.M. 602) has elapsed, based on the estimated length of the trial. If the
parties are unable to proceed to trial on the “presumptive trial date,” they will be required to
account for their inability to do so during the docketing conference.

                        b. It is incumbent upon the responsible base SJA to identify the likely
detailed trial counsel and to notify the responsible Defense Counsel at the point the charges are
forwarded to the Convening Authority for a referral decision so the parties can coordinate their
schedules, determine availability of prospective witnesses and co-counsel, and discuss potential
trial dates well before the docketing conference.

                      c. It also is incumbent upon military defense counsel to coordinate with
civilian defense counsel well ahead of the docketing conference to discuss the same matters and
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             345


alert the civilian counsel to the pendency of the docketing conference. After holding the
docketing conference, the Clerk of Trial Courts or docketing judge will coordinate an initial trial
date and any request to exclude time from accountability under R.C.M. 707 with the CTJ or
DCTJ. The CTJ or DCTJ will decide whether to exclude time from R.C.M. 707 accountability.

                 (4) Docketing Memorandum. Within 24 hours after a trial date is established, the
CDO will prepare a docketing memorandum setting out the initial trial date, identification of the
detailed trial judge, exclusions of time under R.C.M. 707 (if any), and any other relevant data,
including the “presumptive trial date” and government and defense “case ready” dates. The
memorandum will be e-mailed to the detailed trial and defense counsel, and civilian defense
counsel.

Rule 2.6. PRETRIAL RCM 802 SCHEDULING CONFERENCE

         (A) Experience shows that early dialogue between the military judge and counsel is
critical to timely and orderly progress of the case. This dialogue should identify issues that are
outstanding or foreseeable and capable of early resolution -- e.g., approval of experts, discovery,
evidentiary motions, requests for sanity boards.

       (B) Accordingly, in each general and special court-martial, the military judge will,
pursuant to R.C.M. 802, conduct a Pretrial Scheduling Conference (“Scheduling Conference”) as
soon as possible and not later than seven calendar days after the case is docketed for trial.
Scheduling conferences should be held either face-to-face or via video teleconference. The
scheduling conference may be held telephonically when the military judge determines that this
method will be most expeditious and effective. Upon request from the military judge, trial
counsel will coordinate all conference communications. During the conference, the military
judge will undertake a detailed examination of all potential issues with counsel to ensure trial is
held on (or before) the initial trial date. Counsel will apprise the detailed judge of all issues that
may affect the scheduled trial date, such as providing discovery, availability of witnesses and
experts, submission of motions, sanity concerns or any other relevant issue.

Rule 2.7. SCHEDULING ORDER

        (A) After the 802 Scheduling Conference, the military judge will, except where found to
be unnecessary, issue a Scheduling Order to establish timelines, resolve issues, and move the
case forward most effectively. A sample of a Scheduling Order is provided at Appendix C.

       (B) The military judge will proactively manage case progress. To this end, the military
judge will conduct additional conferences as appropriate. If the military judge determines that a
separate Article 39(a)/arraignment session is necessary, the military judge will schedule separate
sessions. These matters are covered in more detail in Rules 3.4 and 3.5.

        (C) The military judge will remain alert to the opportunity to move the trial date forward
in time. The trial date may be advanced at the discretion of the military judge.
 346                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


                                     PRETRIAL MATTERS

Rule 3.1. COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE MILITARY JUDGE

       (A) EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS. Except as provided by the Manual for Courts-
Martial, ex parte communications between counsel and the military judge concerning a case
pending before that military judge are prohibited. Routine administrative matters are excluded
from this prohibition.

       (B) WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS. Except in the case of an authorized ex parte
communication, counsel will—on all written communications with the military judge—send a
copy of the communication to opposing counsel.

        (C) ORAL COMMUNICATIONS. On oral communications with the military judge, the
military judge will determine whether the communication needs to be reduced to writing and if
so, by which party.

Rule 3.2. PRETRIAL NOTICE REQUIREMENTS
Unless an extension or waiver is granted by the military judge for good cause, the following
notice requirements apply.

        (A) PLEAS AND FORUM. Defense counsel will file a notice of probable pleas and
choice of forum with the Court (with a copy to trial counsel and the court reporter) in writing not
later than 24 hours after the accused is served with the referred charges or seven calendar days
prior to the scheduled trial date, whichever is later. The pleas will be expressed in the precise
form counsel anticipate announcing them in open court. Defense counsel will promptly notify
the judge and trial counsel of any change in anticipated plea or choice of forum. If defense
counsel learns that a case previously scheduled as a litigated trial has turned into a guilty plea,
defense counsel shall notify the CDO of the change in plea. If feasible, the CDO and/or the
military judge will conduct an additional docketing conference to see if the trial can be moved to
an earlier date.

        (B) PRETRIAL AGREEMENTS. Defense counsel will notify the military judge that a
pretrial agreement offer has been submitted to the Government. If the Government accepts an
accused’s offered pretrial agreement, the trial counsel will immediately provide a copy of the
offer portion of the pretrial agreement to the military judge. In addition, trial counsel will
provide the military judge any stipulation of fact.

        (C) ALTERNATE DISPOSITION. Trial and defense counsel will notify the military
judge immediately whenever a request for discharge or resignation or retirement in lieu of court-
martial has been submitted.

        (D) MOTIONS. Counsel for both sides will file a notice of the substance of any
anticipated motions, including motions in limine, in accordance with any Scheduling Order or
other order of the military judge, and, in any event, not later than fourteen calendar days prior to
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            347


trial, in order to permit the Court and opposing counsel to research the issues in advance of the
trial or scheduled hearing.

        (E) WITNESS LISTS. Counsel for both sides will file a list containing each anticipated
witness’ full name, unit/duty station (as applicable), address and telephone number not later than
five days after receipt of discovery or the date specified in the military judge’s Scheduling Order,
whichever is earlier. Counsel will amend and update their lists as appropriate with the Court
(with a copy to opposing counsel and the court reporter).

        (F) VOIR DIRE. Counsel for both sides will provide a written copy of their proposed
voir dire to the military judge and opposing counsel not later than three duty days prior to trial or
the date specified in the military judge’s Scheduling Order, whichever is earlier. Unless the
military judge directs otherwise, counsel will conduct voir dire, based on the questions approved
by the military judge from the written submissions.

        (G) PROPOSED INSTRUCTIONS. Requests for special instructions will be in writing
and presented to the military judge and opposing counsel as required by any Scheduling Order or
as early as possible during the trial proceedings.

        (H) OTHER REQUIRED NOTIFICATIONS. Counsel for both sides will file other
notifications required by the Manual for Courts-Martial or other authority—such as notice of
certain defenses and notices under M.R.E. 412, 413 and 414 in accordance with any Scheduling
Order or other order of the military judge.

Rule 3.3. DISCOVERY

       (A) Counsel are to review, be familiar with, and adhere to R.C.M. 701 – 703. Early,
responsive discovery is strongly encouraged and leads to orderly, on-time trials.

        (B) Requests for discovery will be made to the opposing side as soon as possible and
otherwise in accordance with any Scheduling Order or other order of the military judge. In the
absence of a Scheduling Order, parties will file the initial discovery request within five calendar
days of the docketing conference. Formal replies will be made within two duty days. Counsel
for both sides will promptly respond to and comply with all requests for discovery. If some
items require additional time, counsel will file a partial response and notify the opposing party
and the court of the anticipated completion date. The military judge will be notified at the initial
RCM 802 Scheduling Conference, or subsequently as matters arise whenever discovery issues
require judicial engagement/resolution.

       (C) INITIAL DISCLOSURE. Before or upon service of charges, the SJA or trial
counsel will provide defense counsel with copies of the charge sheet, the commander’s
forwarding memo, convening order(s), pertinent investigative reports, and statements relating to
an offense charged in the case, and any R.C.M. 701(a)(6) evidence.

Rule 3.4. PRETRIAL CONFERENCES
As noted in Rule 2.6(B), pretrial conferences, in addition to the Scheduling Conference with the
 348                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


military judge and counsel for both sides, will be held as necessary to keep the case on track.
The accused is neither required nor prohibited from attending any such conference. Conferences
may be held to inform the military judge of unusual problems or issues arising after the
Scheduling Conference and to seek judicial engagement/resolution. However, pretrial
conferences will not be used to litigate or decide contested issues. See R.C.M. 802 and
Discussion.

Rule 3.5. ARTICLE 39(a) SESSIONS
The military judge may set an Article 39(a) session, to include arraignment, as part of the pretrial
Scheduling Order or by subsequent order. Military judges should consider Article 39(a) sessions
prior to the date of trial to conduct arraignment and resolve outstanding legal issues. Such
sessions may be conducted via video teleconference in accordance with the provisions of AFI
51-201, paragraph 8.21 and Rule 3.8, below.

Rule 3.6. MOTIONS

        (A) NOTICE AND FILING. IAW Rules 2.6 and 3.2(D), counsel for both sides will
notify the military judge and opposing counsel of any motions, evidentiary objections or other
issues which may be litigated before or at trial. Motions will be in writing and filed in
accordance with the Scheduling Order or other order of the military judge. Every motion,
pleading or other document submitted to the Court by a party will be signed by at least one
counsel of record.

       (B) SPECIFIC MOTIONS. Counsel are to review and be familiar with the various types
of motions as outlined in R.C.M. 906 – 907.

        (C) OTHER REMEDIES. Prior to filing a motion, counsel will make reasonable efforts
to secure the requested relief from opposing counsel. These rules do not operate to relieve the
moving counsel from complying with applicable provisions of the Manual for Courts-Martial, to
include any requirement to seek relief from the convening authority before seeking such relief
from the court.

        (D) CONTENTS. Motions will include a caption indicating the parties to the case, the
personal data of the accused, and the title of the motion. “Personal data” includes rank, name,
and duty assignment; the member’s social security number should not be included. Motions will
include: (1) the specific relief requested, (2) a statement of relevant facts; (3) the applicable law;
(4) argument and (5) a conclusion. Motions will include a statement of whether the moving
party requests or waives an Article 39(a) session to present argument or evidence. Replies will
indicate agreement or disagreement with the stated facts. Affidavits may be attached when
controverted factual issues are involved. A sample motion is at Appendix B.

        (E) RULINGS. Rulings upon pretrial motions will be announced by appropriate court
order. The order (where written), the motion and the response will be designated as appellate
exhibits in the record of trial.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                              349


Rule 3.7. SPEEDY TRIAL CHRONOLOGY
In those cases where the defense moves to dismiss the charges and specifications on the grounds
of denial of speedy trial, the trial counsel will prepare a written chronology of events prior to trial.
The chronology will be in the format approved in United States v. Ramsey, 28 M.J. 370, 374
(C.M.A. 1989). If counsel are unable to stipulate to the events and dates, areas of disagreement
should be identified and litigated when the appropriate motion is presented.

Rule 3.8. USE OF VIDEOTELECONFERENCING (VTC)
Video teleconferencing is authorized for all preliminary matters prior to the entry of pleas by the
accused, to include conferences held under R.C.M. 802 and Article 39(a) sessions. If either party
proposes to use alternatives to testimony after the court is assembled, such as VTC (or other
audiovisual) technology, in accordance with R.C.M. 703(b)(1), 804(b), 805(a), 805(c), and/or
R.C.M. 914B (and AFI 51-201 para 8.21), the proponent shall serve notice of its intent on the
Court and opposing counsel not later than ten duty days prior to trial. Any objection shall be
filed within two duty days of receipt.

                                         DURING TRIAL

Rule 4.1. CONVENING THE COURT
The military judge will establish the time and date of the initial convening of the Court and all
sessions thereafter. All personnel of the court will be present and ready to proceed at the
scheduled time.

Rule 4.2. MILITARY JUDGE
All persons in the courtroom, other than the court reporter, will rise when the military judge
enters or leaves the courtroom. If a nameplate is provided for the judge, it will designate the
judge as “Judge        ”. Military rank will not be placed on the nameplate.

Rule 4.3. ROBES
The judicial robe will be worn by the military judge in all Air Force general and special courts-
martial.

Rule 4.4. COURT MEMBERS
All persons, other than the military judge and court reporter, will rise when the members as a
group enter and leave the courtroom.

       (A) INFORMATION PROVIDED TO COURT MEMBERS BEFORE ASSEMBLY.
Court members will not be advised of: (1) the reasons or responsibility for any delay in trial; (2)
requests for sanity boards or administrative separation; or (3) projected pleas or forum. Either
party may apply to the detailed military judge for an order to the court members warning them to
avoid anticipated pretrial publicity.

        (B) QUESTIONNAIRES PROHIBITED. Other than to obtain the normal United States
v. Credit, 2 M.J. 631 (C.M.A. 1976), information for potential members, no pretrial
questionnaires will be sent to any court member, except upon approval of the military judge. No
post-trial questionnaires or surveys will be sent to any member, except upon approval of the
 350                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


military judge. Defense requests for clemency recommendations will be limited solely to that
purpose and do not require the approval of the military judge. R.C.M. 1105(b)(2)(D).

        (C) TELEPHONE STANDBY. Unless otherwise directed by the military judge, court
members will be on 15-minute telephone standby until completion of the preliminary Article
39(a) session. Members will not be released until a judge alone request has been approved on
the record.

       (D) APPROACHING MEMBERS. Unless directed otherwise by the military judge,
counsel may not – without prior permission – approach the court members.

        (E) MEMBERS’ OATH. Trial counsel will swear the members in accordance with the
oath for members in R.C.M. 807(b)(2). The parenthetical “(upon a challenge or)” will be
omitted. No other modifications will be made.

Rule 4.5. PUNCTUALITY
All parties will be punctual for all sessions of the court-martial.

Rule 4.6. UNIFORM AND CIVILIAN ATTIRE
The default military uniform for all courts-martial is military service dress. The military judge
may designate an alternate uniform if a military exigency exists. Civilian attorneys will wear
appropriate business attire suitable for appearance before a federal court.

Rule 4.7. SIDEBAR CONFERENCES
Sidebar conferences will not be used. If matters must be discussed outside the presence of the
court members, an Article 39(a) session will be used.

Rule 4.8. SPECTATORS

        (A) Spectators are welcome to attend any session of a court-martial except those sessions
at which spectators must be excluded, as determined by the military judge. Counsel will ensure
that the military judge is notified if any spectator may be called as a witness, unless the spectator
becomes a witness by observing trial events. (A spectator may observe a providency hearing and
become a witness without prior notification.)

       (B) Consult the military judge in advance if potential spectators exceed normal seating
capacity, before adding chairs inside the bar, or reserving seats for media or family members.
Ordinarily standing-room access will not be approved.

        (C) In a bench trial, the court member seats may be used as spectator seating with
approval of the military judge, and with the understanding that ingress and egress to such seats
will be limited to court recesses. Spectators should be dressed appropriately, befitting the
seriousness of the proceedings.

Rule 4.9. CONDUCT OF SPECTATORS AND PARTICIPANTS DURING TRIAL
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             351


        (A) Spectators ordinarily may enter or leave the courtroom while court is in session.
Spectators will not disturb the proceedings in any way, including verbal expressions, whispering,
shaking or nodding of the head, or similar displays. Spectators will refrain from any activities
indicative of inattention to the proceedings, such as sleeping, clipping nails, reading any material,
and watching, listening to, or playing with any electronic device or game.

        (B) All beepers, audible pagers, and cell phones must be turned off prior to entering the
courtroom. Trial counsel will post signs indicating this requirement outside the courtroom where
spectators and the court members enter. Counsel for both sides are responsible for informing
their witnesses of this requirement.

      (C) Military and civilian law enforcement spectators will not enter the courtroom bearing
arms while the court is in session without the prior approval of the military judge. [See also Rule
6.5.]

        (D) Spectators who violate any rules may be warned that their behavior will not be
tolerated and, at the discretion of the military judge, may be excluded from the courtroom.
Contempt proceedings may be initiated in appropriate cases.

Rule 4.10. SMOKING, FOOD AND BEVERAGES
Smoking, eating food, and drinking beverages will not be permitted in the court-room during
open sessions (except water or other non-alcoholic beverage in an unmarked container for the
trial participants). Trial participants will not chew gum or use any form of tobacco product in the
courtroom.

Rule 4.11. PHOTOGRAPHY AND RECORDINGS
Photographs, sound and video recordings (except those made for the limited purpose of
preparing an official record of the proceedings or for evaluating the performance of any trial
participant) and radio and television broadcasts will not be made in or from the courtroom during
trial proceedings. A closed circuit television system may be used under the circumstances set
forth in M.R.E. 611(d), R.C.M. 804(c), and R.C.M. 914A, when an accused has been removed
from the courtroom, or to accommodate members of the public who have been unable to obtain
space in the courtroom. [See also R.C.M. 806(c)]

Rule 4.12. READING BACK PORTIONS OF THE RECORD
Portions of the record of trial including prior questions or answers will be reread or replayed
back to the Court only at the direction of the military judge.

Rule 4.13. DELIBERATIONS
A deliberation room for use by the court members will be provided in every trial with court
members. The court members will not deliberate in the courtroom unless exigent circumstances
are found by the military judge. The bailiff must ensure that counsel, the accused, spectators,
and witnesses do not stand at or near the doors or windows of the deliberation rooms.
 352                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


Rule 4.14. BAILIFF
A bailiff should be present at every court-martial, if practicable. No person will be detailed as a
bailiff who is undergoing correctional custody or who is assigned bailiff duties as a result of
nonjudicial punishment. The bailiff should not have an interest in the case, or a close association
with the accused or with a victim. Ordinarily, the bailiff should be senior in grade to the accused.
The trial counsel will ensure the bailiff is oriented to the courtroom and instructed on bailiff
duties by a base legal office member. If no bailiff is available, trial counsel or assistant trial
counsel will perform the bailiff duties.

Rule 4.15. COURTROOM SECURITY

        (A) SECURITY CONCERNS. If counsel for either side becomes aware of any potential
security concerns counsel will immediately advise the military judge of such concerns.

        (B) PREVENTIVE SECURITY MEASURES. At the initial R.C.M. 802 conference, the
trial counsel will advise the military judge of any special security features of the courtroom, (e.g.,
a “panic button,” bullet resistant plating, or phone connection to law enforcement) and any
planned security actions (e.g., searching spectator’s parcels or metal detector “wanding”).

        (C) GUARDS. After notifying the military judge in advance, the trial counsel will
provide for guards whenever necessary to secure high value evidentiary items or to provide
security for the accused or other trial participants. Guards will not be permitted into the bar of
the Court unless it is necessary for them to carry out their mission. Guards will not be armed,
unless such arming is specifically approved in advance by the military judge.

        (D) CUSTODY OF ACCUSED. The duties of prisoner escort are inconsistent with the
duties of counsel at a court-martial. Neither trial counsel nor defense counsel nor the bailiff will
sign for a prisoner, before or during trial. Ordinarily, a prisoner escort should be detailed from
the accused’s squadron. However, if confinement is adjudged, the trial counsel is responsible for
custody of the accused until the confinement is deferred or the accused is received for
confinement by security forces.

       (E) SECURITY OF ACCUSED. The accused will not be shackled or unshackled, or
physically restrained in the presence of court members except upon prior approval of the military
judge for good cause shown.

                                   CONDUCT OF COUNSEL

Rule 5.1. RESPONSIBILITY OF COUNSEL
Counsel owe a duty both to the client and to the Court. Counsel will assist the military judge in
maintaining a dignified atmosphere within a military setting.

Rule 5.2. INTEGRITY
Conduct of counsel before the court and with opposing counsel will be characterized by candor,
fairness, and civility. Counsel will not violate any established rule of procedure or standing
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                              353


order or ruling of the Court. Counsel’s actions will be tested by a “good faith” standard.
Counsel will not encourage the Court or court members to ignore the law.

Rule 5.3. COURTESY
Counsel will stand when addressing the military judge, court members, or witnesses and when
conducting all trial actions such as examination of witnesses and argument. Counsel will address
the military judge as “Your Honor” and will address the members and the accused by their grade
and name. Unless directed otherwise by the military judge, counsel may, without prior
permission, approach the bench or the court reporter to provide or retrieve evidence.
Inappropriate or rude behavior or language, or any actions calculated to intimidate a witness,
provoke opposing counsel, or improperly impede the proceedings is prohibited. Stated
affirmatively, counsel will treat others civilly and with respect. If the bailiff does not, trial
counsel will say “all rise” whenever the military judge or the entire court member panel enters or
leaves the courtroom.

Rule 5.4. FINDINGS AND SENTENCING WORKSHEET
During trial with court members, trial counsel shall prepare tailored findings and sentencing
worksheets, using the formats in Appendix B, DA Pamphlet 27-9, and submit them to the judge
and opposing counsel at least two duty days prior to trial. Any lesser included offenses likely to
be in issue will be reflected on the findings worksheet.

Rule 5.5. AVOID UNDUE FAMILIARITY
Counsel will refrain from undue familiarity between themselves, with the members, witnesses,
spectators, or the military judge while court is in session, or in front of the accused, spectators,
witnesses or the members.

Rule 5.6. ONE COUNSEL PER CAUSE
Except with the permission of the military judge, only one counsel for each side or for each
accused will examine any one witness or address the court on any issue, motion, objection or
argument.

Rule 5.7. ENGLISH REQUIRED
Counsel will be fluent in written and spoken English.

Rule 5.8. PERSONAL OPINIONS
Counsel will not, during trial, assert personal knowledge of the facts in issue, except when
testifying as a witness. Counsel will not assert a personal opinion as to the justness of a cause,
the credibility of a witness, or the guilt or innocence of the accused except that counsel may
argue for any position or conclusion based on an analysis of the evidence with respect to the
matter stated. Counsel will not express a personal belief or opinion as to an appropriate sentence
or portion thereof.

Rule 5.9. STATE OBJECTION
When making objections, counsel will first state only the objection and the specific basis for it
without further elaboration. Counsel may present argument only on invitation by the military
judge.
 354                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013



Rule 5.10. OBLIGATION TO PRESENT CONTRARY AUTHORITIES
In presenting matters to the Court for ruling, counsel will disclose contrary legal authority known
to counsel and not already disclosed by opposing counsel.

Rule 5.11. RELATIONS WITH THE NEWS MEDIA
Counsel will comply with the Air Force Standards for Criminal Justice, especially Chapter 4,
Fair Trial and Free Press. Military judges will refer all media requests to the servicing staff
judge advocate and installation public affairs office.

Rule 5.12. LEAVING THE COURTROOM
Counsel will not leave the courtroom during trial without first obtaining permission from the
military judge.

                                          WITNESSES

Rule 6.1. COURTESY TO WITNESSES
Witnesses will be treated with fairness and consideration and will not be treated in an abusive
manner. Counsel will examine a witness at a reasonable distance and will not approach a
witness without permission from the military judge.

Rule 6.2. PRETRIAL INSTRUCTIONS TO WITNESSES
Counsel will instruct their witnesses on the physical layout of the courtroom and on proper
decorum while in the courtroom. Specifically, counsel will instruct witnesses to avoid chewing
gum or tobacco, wearing sunglasses, or using profanity, slang or colloquialisms except as
required as part of their testimony. Witnesses will be instructed to avoid casual conversation
with the military judge or court members.

Rule 6.3. SALUTING IN COURT
Military witnesses will not salute the military judge or the President of the Court.

Rule 6.4. AVAILABILITY
Counsel will make arrangements to ensure that witnesses will be immediately available when
called. Counsel will inform the bailiff of the witness’ whereabouts and coordinate with each
other to minimize delays.

       (A) ON-CALL STATUS. Apply common sense. Convenience to the witnesses and a
smooth orderly trial are not inconsistent goals when counsel plan ahead. It is preferable to have
three witnesses waiting rather than have to recess the trial to wait for each of them. On the other
hand, an occasional recess to notify a senior officer or medical officer who is on immediate
telephone standby is acceptable.

       (B) WAITING AREA. Sound discretion often requires segregation of witnesses from
each other or others waiting for service in the legal office. Victim witnesses will be treated as
required by common sense, federal statute, and Air Force Instructions.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            355


        (C) PRESENCE IN COURTROOM. A witness being called at the conclusion of a
recess should be present at the witness stand upon resumption of trial. Prospective witnesses will
not be present in the courtroom during proceedings except upon agreement by both sides and
approval of the military judge, or as otherwise required by law.

        (D) RELEASE OF WITNESSES. No witness will be released beyond recall until the
court is adjourned, without the approval of the military judge.

Rule 6.5. ATTIRE
Military members should normally testify in service dress uniform. If approved by the military
judge in advance, military members may testify in an alternative clean, neat, duty uniform.
Whether or not on duty, military witnesses who wear uniforms in the course of their duty should
testify in uniform. However, military witnesses called or recalled unexpectedly during off-duty
hours may testify in civilian attire to avoid inordinate delay. Civilian witnesses should testify in
appropriate, clean, neat attire. Military investigators who routinely work in civilian attire may
wear appropriate clean, neat attire. With advance notice to the military judge, on-duty military
and civilian law enforcement personnel normally armed in the course of their duties with a
holstered sidearm – whether or not concealed – may remain so armed during their testimony.
[See also Rule 4.9.]

                                           EVIDENCE

Rule 7.1. MARKING EXHIBITS
Items intended to be used or introduced as prosecution or defense exhibits at trial will be given to
and marked by the court reporter prior to trial. A combination of numeric and alphabetical
exhibit markings should not be used (e.g., Pros Ex 1A, or Def Ex A1). Mark original documents
(e.g., performance reports, citations, etc.) lightly in pencil or on an attached label so that the
document is not permanently defaced.

        (A) PROSECUTION EXHIBITS. Prosecution exhibits will be marked consecutively
with Arabic numerals and will be labeled “for identification.” If more than one page in length,
use the legend “Page __ of __ pages.”

         (B) DEFENSE EXHIBITS. Defense exhibits will be marked consecutively with capital
letters, using no more than double letters (i.e., A-Z, AA, AB, AC-AZ, BA-BZ, CA-CZ, etc.), and
will be labeled “for identification.” If more than one page in length, use the legend “Page __ of
__ pages.”

      (C) COURT EXHIBITS. Court Exhibits will be numbered consecutively with Arabic
numerals at the direction of the military judge and will be labeled “for identification.”

       (D) APPELLATE EXHIBITS. Appellate Exhibits will be numbered consecutively with
Roman numerals at the direction of the military judge; however, the judge may permit Appellate
Exhibits to be marked consecutively with Arabic numerals if there are a large number of them.
 356                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


       (E) INDEXING EXHIBITS. Multiple exhibits, such as defense sentencing documents
should be preceded by a descriptive index, marked as a defense exhibit. In complex cases with
numerous exhibits the prosecution may do likewise. This will expedite the proceedings by
eliminating the necessity to describe the exhibits orally on the record.

       (F) REJECTED EXHIBITS. With consent of the side proffering a rejected exhibit, it
may be withdrawn at the direction of the military judge to reduce bulk in the record. Likewise, if
an exhibit is modified prior to consideration by the fact-finder, the original version may be
withdrawn with the consent of the parties.

        (G) COPIES. Counsel offering an exhibit shall ordinarily have copies made for the
judge and opposing counsel. When counsel requests to publish a document to the members, that
counsel will have previously made copies for each court member. When counsel are offering an
exhibit for which they wish a copy or reproduction to be substituted in the record, the counsel
should be prepared with an exact copy or reproduction or accurate representation when offering
the exhibit. The copy or reproduction should mirror the actual exhibit as closely as possible, to
include the use of color copies for photographs, or 8 ½ x 11 paper copies for charts or
PowerPoint slides, as appropriate.

Rule 7.2. GUARDING EVIDENCE
The counsel sponsoring the exhibit will exercise care to prevent loss or inappropriate use (e.g.,
drugs, weapons). In addition, counsel will ensure that exhibits not yet received into evidence, or
exhibits which have been offered and rejected, are not displayed before the court members.
Counsel will notify the military judge prior to trial whenever any weapon, ammunition, or
explosive is to be brought into the courtroom during trial.

        (A) CUSTODY OF EVIDENCE. The counsel offering an exhibit remains responsible
for safeguarding the exhibit until turned over to the reporter or evidence custodian at the
conclusion of trial. If chain-of-custody may be in issue, counsel will not sign for the evidence
until admissibility is decided. In that event, the evidence custodian may remain in the courtroom
or at counsel table with the approval of the military judge.

        (B) WEAPONS AS EVIDENCE. Weapons – or objects capable of use as a weapon –
will be treated with appropriate respect and precaution, and will be kept at all times under the
personal supervision of the counsel offering them.

               (1) Firearms. Any firearm brought into the courtroom as evidence will be
“broken” or disabled in a manner to make it VISIBLY INOPERABLE to all persons in the
courtroom. Additionally, a yellow wooden pencil will be inserted prominently into the chamber
end of the barrel (or a nylon “zip-cuff” or a bicycle lock may be securely fastened through the
barrel and chamber) to demonstrate that no round is present in the firing position. If counsel has
the SLIGHTEST DOUBT as to the meaning of this rule, or any terminology in this rule, or how
to properly handle the firearm, counsel will seek and obtain appropriate expert guidance PRIOR
to trial. Do NOT point the barrel of ANY firearm at ANY person.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                              357


               (2) Ammunition. Live rounds of ammunition for any firearm will not be present
in the courtroom at the same time as the firearm.

                (3) Other Weapons. Other weapons (or items capable of use as a weapon) will be
kept out of the reach of the accused, witnesses, and spectators, except upon explicit approval of
the military judge for purposes of identification or carefully supervised demonstration.
Explosives, flammable or caustic liquids, or other hazardous materials will be not be brought into
the courtroom except on prior approval of the judge.

                                      TRIAL PROCEDURE

Rule 8.1. PROCEDURE GUIDE
The Procedure Guide for use in Air Force courts-martial will be DA Pamphlet 27-9, as modified
by the Chief Trial Judge, US Army Trial Judiciary, and the Chief Trial Judge, US Air Force Trial
Judiciary. Nothing in this rule prohibits military judges from exercising their discretion to depart
from the procedure guide, where appropriate, and from fashioning appropriate instructions,
notwithstanding those set forth in DA Pamphlet 27-9.

Rule 8.2. OFFERS OF PROOF
Offers of proof are not evidence. Essential findings will not be based on offers of proof. Offers
of proof will be utilized only in those circumstances set out in M.R.E. 103(a)(2).

Rule 8.3. UNSWORN STATEMENT BY THE ACCUSED
An accused may make an unsworn oral statement from a location approved by the military judge.
The unsworn statement may contain any matters allowed by law or precedent.

Rule 8.4. STIPULATIONS
Counsel will attempt to narrow the issues to be litigated as much as possible by the use of
stipulations of fact and testimony. Stipulations will normally be in writing. Oral stipulations
will be offered only when circumstances have prevented preparation of a written stipulation.

                                      RECORDS OF TRIAL

Rule 9.1. SUBSTITUTING EXHIBITS IN THE RECORD OF TRIAL
If an exhibit is not to be included in the record of trial because of its size (e.g., an automobile, a
piano), it may be photographed and the photograph substituted in the record, or it may be
described by its relevant physical or identification characteristics (e.g., one 1985 Pontiac, Model
Grand Prix, blue, two door, serial number 1234-45-6789, with a large dent in the right front
fender). If an exhibit is not to be included in the record because of its nature (e.g., drugs,
money), it may be photographed or described. A description is generally preferable to a
photograph because a description conserves time and resources. Counsel will obtain the
permission of the military judge to substitute for an item of evidence in the record.

Rule 9.2. PREPARATION AND AUTHENTICATION OF RECORDS OF TRIAL
 358                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


         (A) In all courts-martial, the trial counsel is responsible for completion of the record of
trial. In discharging this duty, trial counsel will review the procedures outlined in R.C.M. 1103,
1103A and 1104.

        (B) The military judge—or the court reporter as authorized by the military judge in
appropriate cases—is responsible for authenticating the record of trial. However, such
authentication is limited to examining the trial transcript “record of proceedings” and exhibits,
and no other documents which comprise the entire record of trial—e.g., the pretrial investigation
and allied papers.

         (C) The defense counsel has the opportunity to examine and comment upon the record of
trial prior to authentication.

       (D) Experience has shown that the adoption of four practices will produce an accurate
and speedily accomplished record of trial. (These four practices are highly encouraged but not
mandatory.) These four practices are:

               (1) The military judge and the court reporter, immediately following adjournment
of the court-martial, ensure that all offered exhibits are accounted for and left in the custody of
the court reporter.

                (2) The military judge leaves a signed, but undated, authentication page with the
court reporter. Upon the later direction of the military judge, the court reporter dates and inserts
the previously signed authentication page in the record of trial.

                (3) In a trial of more than one day in duration, the court reporter prepares the
transcript in 50-page electronic increments for in turn review by the trial counsel, defense
counsel and military judge. Such increments enable the counsel and military judge to
accomplish review in “digestible” portions—this enables better and more focused review. Such
increments also enable the court reporter to adopt changes and compile the final record in
segments. Finally, such increments also give the military judge and all concerned quick insight
as to any developing problems or bottlenecks in the review process—thus enabling swift
engagement and remediation of the same.

                (4) Corrections to the record of trial by all involved are made and sent by the
electronic “Track Changes” method. To this end, the sender ensures the intended recipient
actually received the e-mail. While this process eliminates the historical “errata sheet” practice
of identifying the changes made, it has the benefit of eliminating unnecessary time spent on
mailing. It also enables counsel and the military judge to easily make minor changes that might

                                            MOTION

The Defense raises a Motion to Dismiss, with prejudice, Specification 1 of the Charge because it
alleges conduct which occurred before the five year Statute of Limitations. The authority for this
Motion is Article 43, U.C.M.J. and R.C.M. 907(b)(2)(B).

                                             FACTS

1. [Procedural background of the case.]

2. [Contention of the alleged victim about the dates the offenses occurred (last offense occurred
on 1 Dec 01.)]

3. The sworn charges were received by the Summary Court-Martial Convening Authority on 9
Jan 07.

                                               LAW

4. Article 43, U.C.M.J., sets forth the applicable Statute of Limitations for alleged violations of
the punitive articles of the U.C.M.J. In recent history, the Statute of Limitations was five years
from the receipt of sworn charges and specifications by an officer exercising summary court-
martial jurisdiction for the vast majority of alleged offenses, unless otherwise specified.

5. [More law.]

6. [More law.]

                                          ARGUMENT
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                                                                         361


7. The acts alleged by ABC are claimed to have occurred more than five years prior to preferral
of the resulting charge and specification and receipt thereof for the officer exercising Summary
Court-Martial Convening Authority (9 Jan 07) in this case.

8. In two recent cases, Army and Navy-Marine Corps trial judges have held that the Statute
extension cannot be applied retroactively. Those respective service appellate courts, however,
which are traditionally quite conservative, have recently overturned what the Defense contends
was the correct application of the law by trial judges. See, United States v. Ratliff, 65 M.J. 806
(N.M.Ct.Crim.App. 2007); Lopez de Victoria, 65 M.J. 521. 1 The Defense, like the respective
trial judges, asserts the applicable Statute of Limitations that applies in this case is the five-year
statute of limitations set forth in U.C.M.J. Article 43 for all non-rape child sexual abuse
allegations which allegedly occurred before the FY 2004 National Defense Authorization Act,
Public Law 108-136.

9. In making a decision on this issue, the Defense believes the Court should also take into
account the Air Force’s failure to pursue this case in 2001 when the allegations were brought to
the attention of both SSgt Accused’s Commander at the time, as well as officials at Anybase
AFB, TX. Consequently, the Air Force had access to all available information about the 2001
allegations, at that time, at two separate levels, and chose to take no action. Accordingly, the
Government should not now be permitted to complain that the 04 NDAA must be applied
retroactively to revive a prosecution they declined when it was originally reported – at a time
when all available evidence was fresh, as well as witness memory.

10. Based on the arguments articulated above, our position is that the allegations embraced by
Specification 1 of the Charge are time-barred by the law that existed at the time of the alleged
acts and by the state of current military law with precedential impact. The exceptions to the
previous five-year statute of limitations provided for by the 2004 NDAA do not apply to the
allegations in this case. The allegations in this case do not fall under any other exception to the
Article 43 five-year statute. Consequently, Specification 1 of the Charge should be dismissed
with prejudice.

                                                      RELIEF REQUESTED

11. THEREFORE, the Defense respectfully requests this Honorable Court grant the Motion to
Dismiss (with prejudice) Specification 1 of the Charge for violation of the applicable Statute of
Limitations.




1 Interestingly, the Army Court in Lopez de Victoria, in distinguishing its result from Richardson and Toussie, exhibited its willingness to step
into the legislature’s shoes when the offense concerns child victims, while concluding that perpetrators who evaded the Vietnam War draft might
properly yield a different outcome. 65 M.J. at 529-30.1 But the legal principles at issue are the same in both cases. They should apply equally to
all defendants, regardless of whether the crimes of one set of defendants are deemed more repugnant than those of another.

V. APPLICATION OF THE CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT


                                PART I. INTRODUCTION

        In 1924, the American Bar Association (ABA) formulated the original Canons of Judicial
Ethics. In 1972, the ABA adopted the Code of Judicial Conduct, which was slightly amended in
1984. That code, with some modification, has been adopted by the Judicial Conference of the
United States and most states. In late 1988, after a conference of appellate military judges, the
service Courts of Military Review appointed a working group composed of a judge from each of
the Courts of Military Review to study the ABA Code of Judicial Conduct and make
recommendations to their respective Judge Advocate Generals (TJAG) about the advisability of
adopting a uniform code of judicial conduct for trial and appellate military judges. During the
time of the working group’s study, the ABA issued a draft revision of its Code of Judicial
Conduct. While that draft revision was not a final product sanctioned by the ABA, the working
group considered the draft. Later in the project, the Chief Trial Judges of each service joined
the group to consider developing regulations and procedures relating to judicial discipline.

        The working group presented the results of their study first to their fellow judges for
review and then worked with representatives of the respective TJAGs for their input and further
considerations. This version of the draft Code of Judicial Conduct was accepted in principle by
the Air Force TJAG but was not accepted by the TJAGs for the other services.

      The American Bar Association revised and then adopted the Model Code of Judicial
Conduct in August 1990. The Working Group’s draft was then revised to conform with this
 366                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct (August 1990) and to accommodate the unique aspects of
service as an Air Force trial or appellate military judge.


                                    PART II. PREAMBLE

        Our legal system is based on the principle that an independent, fair, and competent
judiciary will interpret and apply the laws that govern us. The role of the judiciary is central to
American concepts of justice and the rule of law. Intrinsic to all sections of this code is the
notion that judges, individually and collectively, must respect and honor the judicial office as a
public trust and strive to enhance and maintain confidence in our legal system. The judge is at
once an arbiter of facts and law for the resolution of disputes and a highly visible symbol of
government under the rule of law.

         The Air Force Uniform Code of Judicial Conduct (the Code) is intended to establish
standards for ethical conduct of judges. It consists of broad statements called Canons, specific
rules set forth in Sections under each Canon, a Terminology Part (Part III), an Application Part,
(Part V), and Commentary and References throughout. The text of the Canons and its Sections,
along with the Terminology and Application Parts, is authoritative. The Commentary, by
explanation and example, provides guidance with respect to the purpose and meaning of the
Canons and Sections. The Commentary is not intended as a statement of additional rules. The
References provide authority but are not all-inclusive. When the text uses "shall" or "shall not,"
it is intended to impose binding obligations, the violation of which can result in disciplinary
action. When "should" or "should not" is used, the text is intended to be advisory and a
statement of what is or is not appropriate conduct but it is not intended to be a binding rule under
which a judge may be disciplined. When "may" is used, it denotes permissible discretion or,
depending on the context, it refers to actions that are not covered by specific proscriptions.

        The Canons and Sections are rules of reason. They should be applied consistent with
constitutional requirements, statutes, departmental directives, Air Force instructions, other court
rules, and decisional law, and in the context of all relevant circumstances. The Code is to be
construed so it does not impinge on the essential independence of judges in making judicial
decisions.

        The text of the Canons and Sections is intended to govern conduct of judges and to be
binding upon them. It is not intended, however, that every transgression will result in
disciplinary action. Whether disciplinary action is appropriate, and the degree of discipline to
be imposed, should be determined through a reasonable and reasoned application of the text and
should depend on such factors as the seriousness of the transgression, whether there is a pattern
of improper activity, and the effect of the improper activity on others or on the judicial system.
In addition, this Code and the Canons and Sections are not to be construed as a general order or
regulation within the meaning of Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ); nor are
they designed or intended as a basis for civil liability or criminal actions under the UCMJ.
Furthermore, the purpose of the Code would be subverted if the Code were invoked by lawyers
for mere tactical advantage in a proceeding or by judges for their own personal benefit.

       Accordingly, nothing in the Code should be deemed to augment any substantive legal
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             367


duty of judges or add to the extra-disciplinary consequences of violating such a duty.

        The Code is not intended as an exhaustive guide for the conduct of judges. Judges
should also be governed in their judicial and personal conduct by general ethical standards. The
Code is intended, however, to state basic standards which should govern the conduct of all
judges and to provide guidance to assist judges in establishing and maintaining high standards of
judicial and personal conduct.

        The Code promulgated herein is designed to apply to both active duty and reserve trial
and appellate military judges; but its application to reserve trial and appellate military judges is
limited to those aspects of their service which relate only to their military duties.


                                 PART III. TERMINOLOGY

“Appropriate authority” denotes the authority with responsibility for initiation of the
disciplinary process with respect to the violation to be reported. See Sections 3D(1) and 3D(2).

“Continuing part-time judge” denotes a judge who serves repeatedly on a part-time basis such
as a reserve trial or appellate military judge. The definition also includes a retired judge subject
to recall who is permitted to practice law. See Part V, Subpart C.

“Court personnel” does not include the lawyers in a proceeding before a judge. See Sections
3B(7)(c) and 3B(9).

“De Minimis” denotes an insignificant interest that could not raise reasonable question as to the
judge’s impartiality. See Section 3E(1)(c) and 3E(1)(d).

“Economic interest” denotes ownership of a more than de minimis legal or equitable interest, or
a relationship as officer, director, advisor, or other active participant in the affairs of a party,
except that:

        (i) ownership of an interest in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities
is not an economic interest in such securities unless the judge participates in the management of
the fund, or a proceeding pending or impending before the judge could substantially affect the
value of the interest;

        (ii) service by a judge as an officer, director, advisor, or other active participant in an
educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organization, or service by a judge’s spouse,
parent, or child as an officer, director, advisor, or other active participant in any organization
does not create an economic interest in securities held by that organization;

        (iii) a deposit in a financial institution, the proprietary interest of a policy holder in a
mutual insurance company, of a depositor in a mutual savings association, or of a member in a
credit union, or a similar proprietary interest, is not an economic interest in the organization
unless a proceeding pending or impending before the judge could substantially affect the value of
 368                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


the interest; and

        (iv) ownership of government securities is not an economic interest in the issuer unless a
proceeding pending or impending before the judge could substantially affect the value of the
securities.

See Sections 3E(1)(c) and 3E(2).

“Fiduciary” includes such relationships as executor, administrator, trustee, and guardian. See
Sections 3E(2) and 4E.

“Judge” includes military judge, and is intended to refer to Air Force military judges, both
active duty and reserve, who are serving in a trial or appellate level position.

“Knowingly,” “knowledge,” or “knows” denotes actual knowledge of the fact in question. A
person’s knowledge may be inferred from circumstances. See Sections 3D and 3E(1).

“Law” denotes court rules, as well as statutes, constitutional provisions, Air Force instructions,
and decisional law. See Sections 2A, 3A, 3B(2), 3B(7), 4B, 4C, 4D(5), 4F, and 4I.

“Member of the judge’s family” denotes a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, or
other relative or person with whom the judge maintains a close familial relationship. See
Sections 4D(3), 4E, and 4G.

“Member of the judge’s family residing in the judge’s household” denotes any relative of a
judge by blood or marriage, or a person treated by a judge as a member of the judge’s family,
who resides in the judge’s household. See Section 3E(1) and 4D(5).

“Nonpublic information” denotes information that, by law, is not available to the public.
Nonpublic information may include but is not limited to: information that is sealed by statute or
court order, impounded, or communicated in camera; and information offered in grand jury
proceedings, presentencing reports, dependency cases, or psychiatric reports. See Section
3B(11).

“Periodic part-time judge” denotes a judge who serves or expects to serve repeatedly on a part-
time basis, but under a separate appointment for each limited period of service or for each matter.
A reserve trial or appellate military judge may come within this definition. See Part V, Subpart
D.

“Pro tempore part-time judge” denotes a judge who serves or expects to serve once or only
sporadically on a part-time basis under a separate appointment for each period of service or for
each case heard. A reserve trial or appellate military judge may come within this definition. See
Part V, Subpart E.

“Require.” The rules prescribing that a judge “require” certain conduct of others are, like all of
the rules in this Code, rules of reason. The use of the term “require” in that context means a
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             369


judge is to exercise reasonable direction and control over the conduct of those persons subject to
the judge’s direction and control. See Sections 3B(3), 3B(4), 3B(5), 3B(6), 3B(9), and 3C(2).

“Third degree of relationship.” The following persons are relatives within the third degree of
relationship: great-grandparent, grandparent, parent, uncle, aunt, brother, sister, child, grandchild,
great-grandchild, nephew, or niece. See Section 3E(1)(d).


                                      PART IV. CANONS

                                             CANON 1

         A JUDGE SHALL UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY AND INDEPENDENCE
                           OF THE JUDICIARY.

1A. An independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to justice in our society. A
judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, and enforcing high standards of
conduct, and shall personally observe those standards so that the integrity and
independence of the judiciary will be preserved. The provisions of this Code are to be
construed and applied to further that objective.

Commentary:

        Deference to the judgments and rulings of courts depends on public confidence in the
integrity and independence of judges. The integrity and independence of judges depends in turn
upon their acting without fear or favor. Although judges should be independent, they must
comply with the law, including the provisions of this Code. Public confidence in the
impartiality of the judiciary is maintained by the adherence of each judge to this responsibility.
Conversely, violation of this Code diminishes public confidence in the judiciary and thereby does
injury to the system of government under law.

        Military judges must apply the principles of this Code in all their written and orally
announced decisions and opinions. The judiciary enhances the perception of its independence
and integrity by fully adhering to recognized court standards, Rules for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.),
and the general principle that a court should explain the bases for its decisions regarding issues in
a case submitted for its review.

        Traditionally, some people have thought that military justice is concerned solely with
providing the discipline for the preservation of morale and good order. Military justice is also
properly focused on preserving rights of service members while meeting the needs of military
discipline. Congress and the public expect the military to have a judicial system that is
responsive to the unique needs of discipline in the armed services but safeguards rights of service
members. To this end, Congress has created a military judiciary which is intended to be
independent. Accordingly, judges must recognize and safeguard against any affront to the
independence of a court, such as attempted unlawful influence by a commander or other superior,
or invasion of the deliberative process.
 370                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


        Moreover, any perception of the foregoing similarly must be addressed. Military judges
must ensure that their conduct comports, and is perceived to comport, with the principle of
judicial independence and integrity. That principle includes maintaining the confidentiality of
the deliberative process and the invocation, when necessary, of qualified judicial privilege. The
judiciary’s independence and integrity ultimately depend upon the personal and professional
conduct of the individual judge.

                                             CANON 2

        A JUDGE SHALL AVOID IMPROPRIETY AND THE APPEARANCE OF
              IMPROPRIETY IN ALL OF THE JUDGE’S ACTIVITIES.

2A. A judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner
that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.
Commentary:
        Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by
judges. A judge must avoid all impropriety and appearance of impropriety. A judge must
expect to be the subject of constant public scrutiny. A judge must therefore accept restrictions
on his or her conduct that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen and do so
freely and willingly.

          The prohibition against behaving with impropriety or the appearance of impropriety
applies to both the professional and personal conduct of a judge. Because it is not practicable to
list all prohibited acts, the proscription is necessarily cast in general terms that extend to conduct
by judges that is harmful, although not specifically mentioned in the Code. Actual
improprieties under this standard may include violations of law, court rules, or other specific
provisions of this Code. The test for appearance of impropriety is whether the conduct would
create in reasonable minds a perception that the judge’s ability to carry out judicial
responsibilities with integrity, impartiality, and competence is impaired.

2B. A judge shall not allow family, social, political, or other relationships to influence the
judge’s judicial conduct or judgment. A judge shall not lend the prestige of judicial office
to advance the private interests of the judge or others; nor shall a judge convey or permit
others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the judge.
A judge shall not testify voluntarily as a character witness.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           371


Commentary:
        Maintaining the prestige of judicial office is essential to a system of government in which
the judiciary functions independently of the executive and legislative branches. This is even
more important, and difficult, in a judicial system such as the court-martial system because it is
within the executive branch. Respect for the judicial office facilitates the orderly conduct of
legitimate judicial functions. Judges should distinguish between proper and improper use of the
prestige of office in all of their activities. For example, it would be improper for a judge to
allude to his or her judgeship to gain a personal advantage such as deferential treatment when
stopped by a police officer for a traffic offense. Similarly, judicial letterhead must not be used
for conducting a judge’s personal business affairs. Judges should comply with applicable
regulations on the use of judicial staff and appurtenances of judicial office for personal business.

        A judge must avoid lending the prestige of judicial office for the advancement of the
private interests of others. For example, a judge must not use the judge’s judicial position to
gain advantage in a civil suit involving a member of the judge’s family. As to acceptance of
awards, see Section 4D(5)(a) and accompanying Commentary. This area is further restricted by
Department of Defense (DoD) regulation.

        Although a judge should be sensitive to possible abuse of the prestige of office, a judge
may, based on the judge’s personal knowledge, serve as a reference or provide a letter of
recommendation. However, a judge must not initiate the communication of information to a
sentencing judge or a corrections officer, but may provide to such persons information for the
record in response to a formal request.

        Judges may participate in the process of judicial selection by cooperating with appointing
authorities and screening committees seeking names for consideration, and by responding to
official inquiries concerning a person being considered for a judgeship.

        A judge must not testify voluntarily as a character witness because to do so may lend the
prestige of the judicial office in support of the party for whom the judge testifies. Moreover,
when a judge testifies as a witness, a lawyer who regularly appears before the judge may be
placed in the awkward position of cross-examining the judge. A judge may, however, testify
when properly summoned. Except in unusual circumstances where the demands of justice
require, a judge should discourage a party from requiring the judge to testify.

2C. A judge shall not hold membership in any organization that practices invidious
discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, or national origin.
Commentary:
        Membership of a judge in an organization that practices invidious discrimination may
create the undesirable perception that the judge’s impartiality is impaired. Section 2C refers to
the current practices of the organization. Whether an organization practices invidious
discrimination is often a complex question to which judges must be sensitive. The answer
 372                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


cannot be determined from a mere examination of an organization’s current membership rolls,
but rather depends on how the organization selects members and other relevant factors, such as
that the organization is dedicated to the preservation of religious, ethnic, or cultural values of
legitimate common interest to its members, or that it is in fact and effect an intimate, purely
private organization whose membership limitations could not be constitutionally prohibited.
Absent such factors, an organization is generally said to discriminate invidiously if it arbitrarily
excludes from membership on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin persons who
would otherwise be admitted to membership.

        Although Section 2C relates only to membership in organizations that invidiously
discriminate on the basis of race, sex, religion, or national origin, a judge’s membership in an
organization that engages in any discriminatory membership practices prohibited by the law of
the jurisdiction also violates Canon 2 and Section 2A and gives the appearance of impropriety.
In addition, it would be a violation of Canon 2 and Section 2A for a judge to arrange a meeting at
a club that the judge knows practices invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion,
or national origin in its membership or other policies, or for the judge to regularly use such a
club. Moreover, public manifestation by a judge of the judge’s knowing approval of invidious
discrimination on any basis gives the appearance of impropriety under Canon 2 and diminishes
public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary, in violation of Section 2A.

                                             CANON 3

        A JUDGE SHALL PERFORM THE DUTIES OF THE JUDICIAL OFFICE
                     IMPARTIALLY AND DILIGENTLY.

3A. Judicial Duties in General. The judicial duties of a judge take precedence over all
the judge’s other activities. The judge’s judicial duties include all the duties of the judge’s
office prescribed by law. In the performance of these duties, the following standards
apply.

3B. Adjudicative Responsibilities.

3B(1) A judge shall hear and decide matters assigned to the judge, except those in which
disqualification is required.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                          373


3B(2) A judge shall be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it. A
judge shall not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism.

3B(3) A judge shall require order and decorum in proceedings before the judge.

3B(4) A judge shall be patient, dignified, and courteous to the litigants, court members,
witnesses, lawyers, and others with whom the judge deals in an official capacity, and shall
require similar conduct of lawyers, and of staff, court officials, and others subject to the
judge’s direction and control.

Commentary:

        The duty to hear all proceedings fairly and with patience is not inconsistent with the duty
to dispose promptly of the business of the court. Judges can be efficient and businesslike while
being patient and deliberate.

3B(5) A judge shall perform judicial duties without bias or prejudice. A judge shall not,
in the performance of judicial duties, by words or conduct manifest bias or prejudice,
including but not limited to bias or prejudice based upon race, sex, religion, national origin,
disability, age, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status, and shall not permit staff, court
officials, and others subject to the judge’s direction and control to do so.

Commentary:

        A judge must refrain from speech, gestures, or other conduct that could reasonably be
perceived as sexual harassment and must require the same standard of conduct of others subject
to the judge’s direction and control.

        A judge must perform judicial duties impartially and fairly. A judge who manifests bias
on any basis in a proceeding impairs the fairness of the proceeding and brings the judiciary into
disrepute. Facial expressions and body language, in addition to oral communication, can give to
parties or lawyers in the proceeding, court members, the media, and others an appearance of
judicial bias. A judge must be alert to avoid behavior that may be perceived as prejudicial.

3B(6) A judge shall require lawyers in proceedings before the judge to refrain from
manifesting, by words or conduct, bias or prejudice based upon race, sex, religion, national
origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status, against parties,
witnesses, counsel, and others. This Section does not preclude legitimate advocacy when
race, sex, religion, national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status,
or other similar factors are issues in the proceedings.

3B(7) A judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding, or
that person’s lawyer, the right to be heard according to law. A judge shall not initiate,
permit, or consider ex parte communications, or consider other communications made to
the judge outside the presence of the parties concerning a pending or impending
proceeding except that:
 374                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013



3B(7)(a) Where circumstances require, ex parte communications for scheduling,
administrative purposes, or emergencies that do not deal with substantive matters or issues
on the merits are authorized; provided:

3B(7)(a)(i) the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain a procedural or tactical
advantage as a result of the ex parte communication, and

3B(7)(a)(ii) the judge makes provision promptly to notify all other parties of the
substance of the ex parte communication and allows an opportunity to respond.

3B(7)(b) A judge may obtain the advice of a disinterested expert on the law applicable to
a proceeding before the judge if the judge gives notice to the parties of the person consulted
and the substance of the advice, and affords the parties reasonable opportunity to respond.

3B(7)(c) A judge may consult with court personnel whose function is to aid the judge in
carrying out the judge’s adjudicative responsibilities or with other judges.

3B(7)(d) A judge may, with the consent of the parties, confer separately with the parties
and their lawyers in an effort to mediate or settle matters pending before the judge.

3B(7)(e) A judge may initiate or consider any ex parte communications when expressly
authorized by law to do so.
Commentary:
       The proscription against communications concerning a proceeding includes
communications from lawyers, law teachers, and other persons who are not participants in the
proceeding, except to the limited extent permitted.

     To the extent reasonably possible, all parties or their lawyers shall be included in
communications with a judge.

        Whenever presence of a party or notice to a party is required by Section 3B(7), it is the
party’s lawyer, or if the party is unrepresented the party, who is to be present or to whom notice
is to be given.

        An appropriate and often desirable procedure for a court to obtain the advice of a
disinterested expert on legal issues is to invite the expert to file a brief amicus curiae.

        Certain ex parte communication is approved by Section 3B(7) to facilitate scheduling and
other administrative purposes and to accommodate emergencies. In general, however, a judge
must discourage ex parte communication and allow it only if all the criteria stated in Section
3B(7) are clearly met, subject to R.C.M. 802, as applicable. A judge must disclose to all parties
all ex parte communications received regarding a proceeding pending or impending before the
judge.

       A judge must not independently investigate facts in a case and must consider only the
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             375


evidence presented. This provision does not preclude appellate courts from taking judicial
notice during consideration of a case. This provision does not prevent a military judge from
calling for additional evidence to be presented during trial (see Article 46, UCMJ, and R.C.M.
913(c)(1)(F)); nor does it prevent the Court of Criminal Appeals from exercising the fact finding
powers provided by statute (Article 66(c), UCMJ).

       A judge may request a party to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law,
so long as the other parties are apprised of the request and are given an opportunity to respond to
the proposed findings and conclusions.

        A judge must make reasonable efforts, including providing appropriate supervision, to
ensure that Section 3B(7) is not violated through the actions of law clerks or other personnel on
the judge’s staff.

       If communication between the trial judge and the appellate court with respect to a
proceeding is permitted, a copy of any written communication or the substance of any oral
communication must be provided to all parties.
3B(8) A judge shall dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently, and fairly.
Commentary:
        In disposing of matters promptly, efficiently, and fairly, a judge must demonstrate due
regard for the rights of the parties to be heard and to have issues resolved without unnecessary
cost or delay. Containing costs while preserving fundamental rights of parties also protects the
interests of witnesses and the general public. A judge should monitor and supervise cases so as
to reduce or eliminate dilatory practices, avoidable delays, and unnecessary costs. A judge
should encourage and seek to facilitate settlement, but parties should not feel coerced into
surrendering the right to have their controversy resolved by the courts.

        Prompt disposition of the court’s business requires a judge to devote adequate time to
judicial duties, to be punctual in attending court and expeditious in determining matters under
submission, and to insist that court officials, litigants, and their lawyers cooperate with the judge
to that end.

3B(9) A judge shall not, while a proceeding is pending or impending in any court, make
any public comment that might reasonably be expected to affect its outcome or impair its
fairness or make any nonpublic comment that might substantially interfere with a fair trial
or hearing. The judge shall require similar abstention on the part of court personnel
subject to the judge’s direction and control. This Section does not prohibit judges from
making public statements in the course of their official duties or from explaining for public
information the procedures of the court. This Section does not apply to proceedings in
which the judge is a litigant in a personal capacity.

Commentary:

       The requirement that judges abstain from public comment regarding a pending or
impending proceeding continues during any appellate process and until final disposition. This
Section does not prohibit a judge from commenting on proceedings in which the judge is a
 376                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


litigant in a personal capacity, but in cases such as a writ of mandamus where the judge is a
litigant in an official capacity, the judge must not comment publicly. The conduct of lawyers
relating to trial publicity is governed by Air Force Rules of Professional Conduct (AFRPC) Rule
3.6 and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 51-201, Administration of Military Justice, paragraph 12.6.

3B(10) A judge shall not commend or criticize court members for their findings or
sentence other than in a court order or opinion in a proceeding, but may express
appreciation to the court members for their service to the judicial system and the
community.
Commentary:
       Commending or criticizing court members for their verdict may imply a judicial
expectation in future cases and may impair a court member’s ability to be fair and impartial in a
subsequent case.
3B(11) A judge shall not disclose or use, for any purpose unrelated to judicial duties,
nonpublic information acquired in a judicial capacity.

3C. Administrative Responsibilities.

3C(1) A judge shall diligently discharge the judge’s administrative responsibilities
without bias or prejudice and maintain professional competence in judicial administration,
and should cooperate with other judges and court officials in the administration of court
business.

3C(2) A judge shall require staff, court officials, and others subject to the judge’s
direction and control to observe the standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to the
judge and to refrain from manifesting bias or prejudice in the performance of their official
duties.

3C(3) A judge with supervisory responsibility for the judicial performance of other
judges shall take reasonable measures to assure the prompt disposition of matters before
them and the proper performance of their other judicial responsibilities.

Article 37, UCMJ.

3D. Disciplinary Responsibilities.

3D(1) A judge who receives information indicating a substantial likelihood that another
judge has committed a violation of this Code should take appropriate action. A judge
having knowledge that another judge has committed a violation of this Code that raises a
substantial question as to the other judge’s fitness for office shall inform the appropriate
authority.

3D(2) A judge who receives information indicating a substantial likelihood that a lawyer
has committed a violation of the AFRPC should take appropriate action. A judge having
knowledge that a lawyer has committed a violation of the AFRPC that raises a substantial
question as to the lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects
shall inform the appropriate authority.

3D(3) Acts of a judge, in the discharge of disciplinary responsibilities, required or
permitted by Sections 3D(1) and 3D(2) are part of a judge’s judicial duties and shall be
absolutely privileged, and no civil action predicated thereon may be instituted against the
judge.
Commentary:
        Military judges have a responsibility to ensure that the highest standards of justice and
ethical responsibility are observed throughout the military justice system. This responsibility
includes taking appropriate action upon observing conduct that might reasonably raise adverse
perceptions about military justice. "Appropriate action" in the context of this rule is intended to
mean that the judge is required to report to a disciplinary authority misconduct of lawyers and
other judges and to encourage judges to take other remedial steps as appropriate, such as
referring the judge or lawyer whose conduct is in question to a substance abuse treatment
program. The rule was designed to reflect the standards for reporting professional misconduct
that appear in AFRPC Rule 8.3. A military judge may report misconduct by other trial or
appellate military judges or by lawyers to their chief judge or to The Judge Advocate General.

3E. Disqualification.

3E(1) A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge’s
impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where:
Commentary:
        Under this rule, a judge is disqualified and should recuse himself or herself whenever the
judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, regardless of whether any of the specific
rules in Section 3E(1) apply.

       A judge should disclose on the record information that the judge believes the parties or
 378                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


their lawyers might consider relevant to the question of disqualification, even if the judge
believes there is no real basis for disqualification.

        By decisional law, the rule of necessity may override the rule of disqualification. For
example, a judge might be the only judge available in a matter requiring immediate judicial
action, such as a hearing on witness production, speedy trial, or a temporary restraining order.
In the latter case, the judge must disclose on the record the basis for possible disqualification and
use reasonable efforts to transfer the matter to another judge as soon as practicable.
Reference:
United States v. Berman, 28 M.J. 615 (A.F.C.M.R. 1989).

3E(1)(a) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party or personal
knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding;

3E(1)(b) the judge served as lawyer in the matter in controversy, or a lawyer with whom
the judge previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning
the matter, or the judge or such lawyer has been a material witness concerning it;
Commentary:
       A lawyer in a governmental agency does not ordinarily have an association with other
lawyers employed by that agency within the meaning of Section 3E(1)(b); a judge formerly
employed by a government agency, however, should disqualify himself or herself in a
proceeding if the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned because of such
association.
References:
R.C.M. 902.
United States v. Sherrod, 26 M.J. 30 (C.M.A. 1988).
3E(1)(c) the judge knows that the judge, individually or as a fiduciary, or the judge’s
spouse, parent, or child wherever residing, or any other member of the judge’s family
residing in the judge’s household, has an economic interest in the subject matter in
controversy or is a party to the proceeding or has any other than de minimis interest that
could be substantially affected by the proceeding; and
3E(1)(d) the judge or the judge’s spouse, or a person within the third degree of
relationship to either of them, or the spouse of such a person:
3E(1)(d)(i) is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party;

3E(1)(d)(ii) is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding;

3E(1)(d)(iii) is known by the judge to have a more than de minimis interest that could be
substantially affected by the proceeding; or
3E(1)(d)(iv) is to the judge’s knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding.
Commentary:
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           379



        The fact that a lawyer in a proceeding is affiliated with a law firm with which a relative
of the judge is affiliated does not of itself disqualify the judge. Under appropriate
circumstances, the fact that "the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned" under
Section 3E(1), or that the relative is known by the judge to have an interest in the law firm that
could be "substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding" under Section 3E(1)(d)(iii)
may require the judge’s disqualification.

3E(2) A judge shall keep informed about the judge’s personal and fiduciary economic
interests, and make a reasonable effort to keep informed about the personal economic
interests of the judge’s spouse and minor children residing in the judge’s household.

3F. Remittal of Disqualification. A judge disqualified by the terms of Section 3E and
R.C.M. 902(a) may disclose on the record the basis of the judge’s disqualification and may
ask the parties and their lawyers to consider, out of the presence of the judge, whether to
waive disqualification. If, following disclosure of any basis for disqualification other than
personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, the parties and lawyers, without
participation by the judge, all agree that the judge should not be disqualified, and the judge
is then willing to participate, the judge may participate in the proceeding. The agreement
shall be incorporated in the record of the proceeding.
Commentary:
        A remittal procedure provides the parties an opportunity to proceed without delay if they
wish to waive the disqualification. To assure that consideration of the question of remittal is
made independently of the judge, a judge must not solicit, seek, or hear comment on possible
remittal or waiver of the disqualification unless the lawyers jointly propose remittal after
consultation as provided in the rule. A party may act through counsel if counsel represents on
the record that the party has been consulted and consents. As a practical matter, a judge may
wish to have all parties and their lawyers sign the remittal agreement.

 380                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


4A(2) demean the judicial office; or

4A(3) interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties.

Commentary:

        Complete separation of a judge from extra-judicial activities is neither possible nor wise;
a judge should not become isolated from the community in which the judge lives. Military
judges must follow carefully, and appear to follow carefully, the provisions of statutes, executive
orders, and any applicable Air Force instructions prescribing rules to uphold the integrity and
public confidence in military and federal public service.

        Expressions of bias and prejudice by a judge, even outside the judge’s judicial activities,
may cast reasonable doubt on the judge’s capacity to act impartially as a judge. Expressions
which may do so include jokes or other remarks demeaning individuals on the basis of their race,
sex, religion, national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status. See
Section 2C and accompanying Commentary.

4B. Avocational Activities. A judge may speak, write, lecture, teach, and participate in
other extra-judicial activities concerning the law, the legal system, the administration of
justice, and non-legal subjects, subject to the requirements of this Code.
Commentary:
         As a judicial officer and person specially learned in the law, a judge is in a unique
position to contribute to the improvement of the law, the legal system, and the administration of
justice, including revision of substantive and procedural law and improvement of the military
justice system. To the extent that a judge’s time permits, a judge is encouraged to do so, either
independently or through a bar association, judicial conference, or other organization dedicated
to the improvement of the law. Judges may participate in efforts to promote the fair
administration of justice, the independence of the judiciary, and the integrity of the legal
profession, and may express opposition to the persecution of lawyers and judges in other
countries because of their professional activities.

        In this and other Sections of Canon 4, the phrase “subject to the requirements of this
Code” is used, notably in connection with a judge’s governmental, civic, or charitable activities.
This phrase is included to remind judges that the use of permissive language in various Sections
of the Code does not relieve a judge from the other requirements of the Code that apply to the
specific conduct.

4C. Governmental, Civic, or Charitable Activities.

4C(1) A judge shall not appear at a public hearing before, or otherwise consult with, an
executive or legislative body or official except on matters concerning the law, the legal
system or the administration of justice or except when acting pro se in a matter involving
the judge or the judge’s interests.
Commentary:
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                              381


       See Section 2B regarding the obligation to avoid improper influence.

        This Section does not apply to military judges who are required to attend conferences,
professional military education courses, and other military gatherings associated with the
obligation as officers of the United States Air Force; nor does it affect their obligation to assist in
the continuing legal education and professional education of attorneys in or out of military or
government service.

4C(2) A judge shall not accept appointment to a governmental committee or commission
or other governmental position that is concerned with issues of fact or policy on matters
other than the improvement of the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice.
A judge may, however, represent a country, state, or locality on ceremonial occasions or in
connection with historical, educational, or cultural activities.
Commentary:
        Section 4C(2) prohibits a judge from accepting any governmental position except one
relating to the law, legal system, or administration of justice as authorized by Section 4C(3).
Insofar as this provision might interfere with an appointment in the United States Air Force as a
regular or reserve officer, this provision does not apply to trial or appellate military judges. The
appropriateness of accepting extra-judicial assignments must be assessed, in light of the demands
on judicial resources created by crowded dockets and the need to protect the courts from
involvement in extra-judicial matters that may prove to be controversial. Judges should not
accept appointments that are likely to interfere with the effectiveness and independence of the
judiciary.

        Section 4C(2) does not govern a judge’s service in a nongovernmental position. See
Section 4C(3) permitting service by a judge with organizations devoted to the improvement of
the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice and with educational, religious,
charitable, fraternal, or civic organizations not conducted for profit.

4C(3) A judge may serve as an officer, director, trustee, or non-legal advisor of an
organization or governmental agency devoted to the improvement of the law, the legal
system, or the administration of justice or of an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal,
or civic organization not conducted for profit, subject to the following limitations and the
other requirements of this Code.
Commentary:
       Section 4C(3) does not pertain to a judge’s service in a governmental position
unconnected with the improvement of the law, the legal system or the administration of justice;
see Section 4C(2).

        See Commentary to Section 4B regarding use of the phrase “subject to the following
limitations and the other requirements of this Code.” As an example of the meaning of the
phrase, a judge permitted by Section 4C(3) to serve on the board of a fraternal institution may be
prohibited from such service by Sections 2C or 4A if the institution practices invidious
discrimination or if service on the board otherwise casts reasonable doubt on the judge’s capacity
to act impartially as a judge.
 382                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013



        Service by a judge on behalf of a civic or charitable organization may be governed by
other provisions of Canon 4 in addition to Section 4C. For example, a judge is prohibited by
Section 4G from serving as a legal advisor to a civic or charitable organization.
4C(3)(a) A judge shall not serve as an officer, director, trustee, or non- legal advisor if it is
likely that the organization:
4C(3)(a)(i) will be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the judge, or

4C(3)(a)(ii) will be engaged frequently in adversary proceedings in the court of which the
judge is a member or in any court subject to the appellate jurisdiction of the court of which
the judge is a member.

Commentary:
        The changing nature of some organizations and of their relationship to the law makes it
necessary for a judge regularly to reexamine the activities of each organization with which the
judge is affiliated to determine if it is proper for the judge to continue the affiliation.

4C(3)(b) A judge as an officer, director, trustee, or non-legal advisor, or as a member of
an organization:

4C(3)(b)(i) may assist the organization in planning fund-raising and may participate in
the management and investment of the organization’s funds, but shall not personally
participate in the solicitation of funds or other fund-raising activities, except that a judge
may solicit funds from other judges over whom the judge does not exercise supervisory
authority;

4C(3)(b)(ii)    may make recommendations to public and private fund-granting
organization on projects and programs concerning the law, the legal system, or the
administration of justice;

4C(3)(b)(iii) shall not personally participate in membership solicitation if the solicitation
might reasonably be perceived as coercive or, except as permitted in Section 4C(3)(b)(i), if
the membership solicitation is essentially a fund-raising mechanism; and

4C(3)(b)(iv) shall not use or permit the use of the prestige of judicial office for fund-raising
or membership solicitation.
Commentary:
         A judge may solicit membership or endorse or encourage membership efforts for an
organization devoted to the improvement of the law, the legal system, or the administration of
justice, or for a nonprofit educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organization so
long as the solicitation cannot reasonably be perceived as coercive and is not essentially a fund-
raising mechanism. Solicitation of funds for an organization and solicitation of memberships
similarly involve the danger that the person solicited will feel obligated to respond favorably to
the solicitor if the solicitor is in a position of influence or control. A judge must not engage in
direct, individual solicitation of funds or memberships in person, in writing, or by telephone,
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           383


except in the following cases: (1) a judge may solicit, for funds or memberships, other judges
over whom the judge does not exercise supervisory or appellate authority; (2) a judge may solicit
other persons for membership in the organizations described above if neither those persons nor
persons with whom they are affiliated are likely ever to appear before the court on which the
judge serves and; (3) a judge who is an officer of such an organization may send a general
membership solicitation mailing over the judge’s signature.

        Use of an organization letterhead for fund-raising or membership solicitation does not
violate Section 4C(3)(b), provided the letterhead lists only the judge’s name and office or other
position in the organization, and, if comparable designations are listed for other persons, the
judge’s judicial designation. In addition, a judge must also make reasonable efforts to ensure
that the judge’s staff, court officials, and others subject to the judge’s direction and control do
not solicit funds on the judge’s behalf for any purpose, charitable or otherwise. In evaluating the
application of this guidance, the judge should consult the applicable DoD regulation.

       A judge shall not be a speaker or guest of honor at an organization’s fund-raising event,
but mere attendance at such an event is permissible if otherwise consistent with this Code and the
applicable DoD regulation.

4D. Financial Activities.

4D(1) A judge shall not engage in financial and business dealings that:
4D(1)(a) may reasonably be perceived to exploit the judge’s judicial position, or

4D(1)(b) involve the judge in frequent transactions or continuing business relationships
with those lawyers or other persons likely to come before the court on which the judge
serves.
Commentary:
        The Time for Compliance provision of this Code postpones the time for compliance with
certain provisions of this Section in some cases.

        When a judge acquires in a judicial capacity information, such as material contained in
filings with the court, that is not yet generally known, the judge must not use the information for
private gain. See Section 2B; see also Section 3B(11).

        A judge must avoid financial and business dealings that involve the judge in frequent
transactions or continuous business relationships with persons likely to come either before the
judge personally or before other judges on the judge’s court. In addition, a judge should
discourage members of the judge’s family from engaging in dealings that would reasonably
appear to exploit the judge’s judicial position. This rule is necessary to avoid creating an
appearance of exploitation of office or favoritism, and to minimize the potential for
disqualification.

        Participation by a judge in financial and business dealings is subject to the general
prohibitions in Section 4A against activities that tend to reflect adversely on impartiality, demean
the judicial office, or interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties. Such
 384                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


participation is also subject to the general prohibition in Canon 2 against activities involving
impropriety, the appearance of impropriety, and the prohibition in Section 2B against the misuse
of the prestige of judicial office. In addition, a judge must maintain high standards of conduct
in all activities, as set forth in Canon 1. See the Commentary for Section 4B regarding use of
the phrase “subject to the requirements of this Code.”

4D(2) A judge may, subject to the requirements of this Code, hold and manage
investments of the judge and members of the judge’s family, including real estate, and
engage in other remunerative activity.
Commentary:
       This Section provides that, subject to the requirements of this Code, a judge may hold and
manage investments owned solely by the judge, investments owned solely by a member or
members of the judge’s family, and investments owned jointly by the judge and members of the
judge’s family.

4D(3) A judge shall not serve as an officer, director, manager, general partner, advisor, or
employee of any business entity, except that a judge may, subject to the requirements of
this Code, manage and participate in:

4D(3)(a) a business closely held by the judge or members of the judge’s family, or

4D(3)(b) a business entity primarily engaged in investment of the financial resources of
the judge or members of the judge’s family.

Commentary:
        Subject to the requirements of this Code, a judge may participate in a business that is
closely held either by the judge alone, by members of the judge’s family, or by the judge and
members of the judge’s family.

        Although participation by a judge in a closely-held family business might otherwise be
permitted by Section 4D(3), a judge may be prohibited from participation by other provisions of
this Code when, for example, the business entity frequently appears before the judge’s court or
the participation requires significant time away from judicial duties. Similarly, a judge must
avoid participating in a closely-held family business if the judge’s participation would involve
misuse of the prestige of judicial office.

      See also the requirements contained in TJAG Policy Memorandum, TJS-7, Off-Duty
Employment of Judge Advocates and Civilian Attorneys.

4D(4) A judge shall manage the judge’s investments and other financial interests to
minimize the number of cases in which the judge is disqualified. As soon as the judge can
do so without serious financial detriment, the judge shall divest himself or herself of
investments and other financial interests that might require frequent disqualification.

4D(5) A judge shall not accept or knowingly permit a member of the judge’s family
residing in the judge’s household to accept a gift, bequest, favor, or loan from anyone
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           385


except for:
Commentary:
        Because a gift, bequest, favor or loan to a member of the judge’s family residing in the
judge’s household might be viewed as intended to influence the judge, a judge must inform those
family members of the relevant ethical constraints upon the judge in this regard and discourage
those family members from violating them. A judge cannot, however, reasonably be expected
to know or control all of the financial or business activities of all family members residing in the
judge’s household.

4D(5)(a) a gift incident to a public testimonial, books, tapes, or other resource materials
supplied by publishers on a complimentary basis for official use, or an invitation to the
judge and the judge’s spouse or guest to attend a bar-related function or an activity
devoted to the improvement of the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice;
Commentary:
       Acceptance of an invitation to a law-related function is governed by Section 4D(5)(a);
acceptance of an invitation paid for by an individual lawyer or group of lawyers is governed by
Section 4D(5)(h).

        A judge may accept a public testimonial or a gift incident thereto only if the donor
organization is not an organization whose members frequently comprise or represent the same
side in litigation, and the testimonial and gift are otherwise in compliance with other provisions
of this Code. See Section 4A(1) and 2B.

4D(5)(b) a gift, award, or benefit incident to the business, profession, or other separate
activity of a spouse or other family member of a judge residing in the judge’s household,
including gifts, awards, and benefits for the use of both the spouse and other family
member and the judge (as spouse or family member), provided the gift, award, or benefit
could not reasonably be perceived as intended to influence the judge in the performance of
judiciary duties;

4D(5)(c) ordinary social hospitality;

4D(5)(d) a gift from a relative or friend, for a special occasion, such as a wedding,
anniversary, or birthday, if the gift is fairly commensurate with the occasion and the
relationship;
Commentary:
        A gift to a judge, or to a member of the judge’s family living in the judge’s household,
that is excessive in value raises questions about the judge’s impartiality and the integrity of the
judicial office and might require disqualification of the judge where disqualification would not
otherwise be required. See, however, Section 4D(5)(e).

4D(5)(e) a gift, bequest, favor, or loan from a relative or close personal friend whose
appearance or interest in a case would in any event require disqualification under Section
 386                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


3E;

4D(5)(f) a loan from a lending institution in its regular course of business on the same
terms generally available to persons who are not judges;

4D(5)(g) a scholarship or fellowship awarded on the same terms and based on the same
criteria applied to other applicants; or

4D(5)(h) any other gift, bequest, favor, or loan, only if the donor is not a party or other
person who has come or is likely to come or whose interests have come or are likely to come
before the judge.
Commentary:
         Section 4d(5) prohibits judges from accepting gifts, favors, bequests, or loans from
lawyers or their firms if they have come or are likely to come before the judge; it also prohibits
gifts, favors, bequests, or loans from clients of lawyers or their firms when the clients’ interests
have come or are likely to come before the judge.

       Section 4D(5)(h) of the approved ABA Uniform Code of Judicial Conduct includes a
requirement that gifts, bequests, favors, or loans may be accepted only if the judge reports any
such gift, bequest, favor, or loan in excess of $150.00. That provision was not adopted for trial
and appellate military judges because their conduct is already extensively regulated by DoD
Directive 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, which in turn implements the Ethics in Government
Act and provides for appropriate financial disclosure reporting.

4E. Fiduciary Activities.

4E(1) A judge shall not serve as executor, administrator, or other personal representative,
trustee, guardian, attorney-in-fact, or other fiduciary, except for the estate, trust or person
of a member of the judge’s family, and then only if such service will not interfere with the
proper performance of judicial duties.

4E(2) A judge shall not serve as a fiduciary if it is likely that the judge as a fiduciary will
be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the judge, or if the estate,
trust, or ward becomes involved in adversary proceedings in the court on which the judge
serves or one under its appellate jurisdiction.

4E(3) The same restrictions on financial activities that apply to a judge personally also
apply to the judge while acting in a fiduciary capacity.
Commentary:
        The Time for Compliance provision of the Code postpones the time for compliance with
certain provisions of this Section in some cases.

        The restrictions imposed by this Canon may conflict with the judge’s obligation as a
fiduciary. For example, a judge should resign as trustee if detriment to the trust would result
from divestiture of holdings, the retention of which would place the judge in violation of Section
4D(4).
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            387



        Section 4E applies to trial and appellate military judges only when a party or parties for
whom the judge serves as executor, administrator, or other personal representative or other
fiduciary may appear in the judge’s court.

4F. Service as Arbitrator or Mediator. A judge shall not act as an arbitrator or
mediator or otherwise perform judicial functions in a private capacity, unless authorized
by law.
Commentary:
       Section 4F does not prohibit a judge from participating in arbitration, mediation, or
settlement conferences performed as part of judicial duties.
4G. Practice of Law. A judge shall not practice law, except in the performance of his or
her judicial responsibilities. Notwithstanding this prohibition, a judge may act pro se and
may, without compensation, give legal advice to, and draft or review documents for a
member of the judge’s family.
Commentary:
        This prohibition refers to the practice of law in a representative capacity and not in a pro
se capacity. A judge may act for himself or herself in all legal matters, including matters
involving litigation and matters involving appearances before or other dealings with legislative
and other governmental bodies. However, in so doing, a judge must not abuse the prestige of
office to advance the interests of the judge or the judge’s family. See Section 2B.

        The Code allows a judge to give legal advice to and draft legal documents for members of
the judge’s family, so long as the judge receives no compensation. A judge must not, however,
act as an advocate or negotiator for a member of the judge’s family in a legal matter.
4H. Standards of Conduct. A judge is bound by the Ethics in Government Act and all
DoD regulations governing standards of conduct of military personnel.
Commentary:

        This provision has been modified from the approved draft of the ABA Uniform Code of
Judicial Conduct. Trial and appellate military judges are bound by federal statutes, DoD
regulations, and Air Force instructions governing their financial activities, to include the
acceptance of gifts, bequests, honoraria, etc. Where this Code conflicts with federal, DoD, or
Air Force law or directive, the law or directive governs. This Code provides general guidelines
that should assist the military judge in determining the propriety of his or her activities under
federal, DoD, or Air Force law or directive when those provisions may not be clear on a
particular issue.

        The Code does not prohibit a judge from accepting honoraria or speaking fees provided
that the compensation is reasonable and commensurate with the task performed. A judge
should ensure, however, that no conflicts are created by the arrangement. A judge must not
appear to trade on the judicial position for personal advantage. Nor should a judge spend
significant time away from court duties to meet speaking or writing commitments for
 388                                                                       AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


compensation. In addition, the source of the payment must not raise any question of undue
influence or the judge’s ability or willingness to be impartial.

4I. Disclosure of a judge’s income, debts, investments, or other assets is required only to
the extent provided in this Canon and in Sections 3E and 3F, or as otherwise provided by
law or directive.

Commentary:

        Section 3E requires a judge to disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which
the judge has an economic interest. See “economic interest” as defined in the Terminology Part
(Part III). Section 4D requires a judge to refrain from engaging in business and from financial
activities that might interfere with the impartial performance of judicial duties. A judge has the
rights of any other citizen, including the right to privacy of the judge’s financial affairs, except to
the extent that limitations established by law and regulation are required to safeguard the proper
performance of the judge’s duties and insure public confidence in the judiciary.

        The trial and appellate military judge should be aware that not all private investments are
free of ethical considerations. A pertinent example is the purchase of shares in a firm which has
a contract with the Air Force or the DoD to perform drug testing.


                                             CANON 5

 A JUDGE OR JUDICIAL CANDIDATE SHALL REFRAIN FROM INAPPROPRIATE
                        POLITICAL ACTIVITY.

Commentary:

         Canon 5 is not adopted for trial and appellate military judges because the judge’s duties,
rights, and responsibilities in this area are already clearly defined by Air Force instructions and
customs of the service.


          PART V. APPLICATION OF THE CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT

A. Anyone, whether or not a lawyer, who is an officer of a judicial system and who
performs judicial functions, including an officer such as a magistrate, court commissioner,
special master, or referee, is a judge within the meaning of this Code. All judges shall
comply with this Code except as provided below.

Commentary:

       The four categories of judicial service in other than a full-time capacity are necessarily
defined in general terms because of the widely varying forms of judicial service. For the
purposes of this Section, as long as a retired judge is subject to recall the judge is considered to
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                            389


“perform judicial functions.” The determination of which category and, accordingly, which
specific Code provisions apply to an individual judicial officer, depend upon the facts of the
particular judicial service.

B. Retired Judge Subject to Recall. A retired judge subject to recall who by law is not
permitted to practice law is not required to comply:

(1) except while serving as a judge, with Section 4F; and

(2) at any time with Section 4E.
Commentary:
       This provision is meant to apply only to retired reserve military judges who may be
prohibited by the laws of their state from practicing law.

C. Continuing Part-Time Judge. A continuing part-time judge:

(1) is not required to comply

(a) except while serving as a judge, with Section 3B(9), and

(b) at any time with Sections 4C(2), 4D(3), 4E(1), 4F, 4G, and 4H; and

(2) shall not practice law in the court on which the judge serves or in any court subject to
the appellate jurisdiction of the court on which the judge serves, and shall not act as a
lawyer in a proceeding in which the judge has served as a judge or in any other proceeding
related thereto.
Commentary:
        When a person who has been a continuing part-time judge is no longer a continuing part-
time judge, including a retired judge no longer subject to recall, that person may act as a lawyer
in a proceeding in which he or she has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related
thereto only with the express consent of all parties pursuant to AFRPC Rule 1.12(a).

D. Periodic Part-Time Judge. A periodic part-time judge:

(1) is not required to comply

(a) except while serving as a judge, with Section 3B(9),

(b) at any time, with Sections 4C(2), 4C(3)(a), 4D(1)(b), 4D(3), 4D(4), 4D(5), 4E, 4F, 4G,
and 4H; and

(2) shall not practice law in the court on which the judge serves or in any court subject to
the appellate jurisdiction of the court on which the judge serves, and shall not act as a
lawyer in a proceeding in which the judge has served as a judge or in any other proceeding
 390                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


related thereto.
Commentary:
        When a person who has been a periodic part-time judge is no longer a periodic part-time
judge (no longer accepts appointments), that person may act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which
he or she has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related thereto only with the express
consent of all parties pursuant to AFRPC Rule 1.12(a).

E. Pro Tempore Part-Time Judge. A pro tempore part-time judge:

(1) is not required to comply

(a) except while serving as a judge, with Sections 2A, 2B, 3B(9), and 4C(1),

(b) at any time with Sections 2C, 4C(2), 4C(3)(a), 4C(3)(b), 4D(1)(b), 4D(3), 4D(4), 4D(5),
4E, 4F, 4G, and 4H;

(2) a person who has been a pro tempore part-time judge shall not act as a lawyer in a
proceeding in which the judge has served as a judge or in any other proceeding related
thereto, except as otherwise permitted by AFRPC Rule 1.12(a).

F. Time for Compliance. A person to whom this Code becomes applicable shall comply
immediately with all provisions of this Code except Section 4D(2), 4D(3), and 4E, and shall
comply with these Sections as soon as reasonably possible and shall do so in any event
within the period of one year.
Commentary:
        If serving as a fiduciary when selected as judge, a new judge may, notwithstanding the
prohibitions in Section 4E, continue to serve as fiduciary, but only for that period of time
necessary to avoid serious adverse consequences to the beneficiary of the fiduciary relationship
and in no event longer than one year. Similarly, if engaged at the time of judicial selection in a
business activity, a new judge may, notwithstanding the prohibitions in Section 4D(3), continue
in that activity for a reasonable period, but in no event longer than one year.

                                     I. INTRODUCTION

         These regulations and procedures are based on the federal statute dealing with the
discipline of federal judges, 28 U.S.C. Section 372(c), the ABA Model Standards of Judicial
Discipline, and the most recent judicial precedent addressing the initiation, screening,
investigation, review, and appeal of judicial disciplinary proceedings. Information obtained
from the Administrative Office of United States Courts, the Judicial Conference of the United
States, the National Center for State Courts, the National Judicial College, and the American Bar
Association has also been consulted. In addition, numerous law review articles addressing the
issue of judicial disciplinary procedures, including analyses of specific rules and procedures
adopted by state and federal courts, have been reviewed. The basic premise of these authorities
is that to preserve the independence and integrity of the judiciary—judges should judge judges.
That premise is the benchmark of these regulations and procedures.

                                          II. POLICY
 392                                                                      AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013



         These regulations and procedures relating to judicial discipline are established to ensure
that allegations of unprofessional conduct by trial and appellate military judges are examined by
the military judiciary and that proper determination and action is taken regarding that conduct to
preserve and promote the integrity, independence, and impartiality of the military judiciary.
This purpose and these regulations and procedures are independent of any other investigation or
actions regarding alleged misconduct of trial and appellate military judges. The deliberative
processes of the military judiciary, however, shall be preserved from public disclosure in all
instances to the extent possible under recognized qualified judicial privilege precedent. In the
absence of an allegation of fraud or a corrupt motive on the part of a judge, these regulations and
procedures for judicial discipline must not be used as a means for taking action against a judge
for reaching an erroneous factual or legal conclusion or misapplying the law in any particular
case. An erroneous decision by a judge must be left to the regular appellate process. See
Chandler v. Judicial Council, 382 U.S. 1003 (1966), 398 U.S. 74 (1970).

                                          III. PURPOSE

        The purpose of the complaint procedure is to ensure application of the highest standards
of judicial conduct and competence in the court-martial process. The maintenance of such
standards is the responsibility of The Judge Advocate General (TJAG), as set forth in Rules for
Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) Rule 109. These regulations and procedures include taking action
when judges have engaged in conduct that does not meet the standards expected of military
judicial officers. All military judges, trial and appellate, former and currently assigned, are
subject to the application of these rules and regulations for any unprofessional conduct which is
alleged to have occurred during their assignment as judges. These procedures will contribute to
the integrity of court-martial proceedings and thereby preserve and enhance public confidence in
the fairness and correctness of military justice.

                                     IV. TERMINOLOGY

Air Force Uniform Code of Judicial Conduct (the Code) refers to the code which is Attachment
1 to this policy memorandum.

Air Force Judicial Ethics Advisory Council (JEAC) refers to the council established by
Attachment 4 to this policy memorandum.

Chief Trial Judge. The Chief Trial Judge of the USAF Trial Judiciary.

Complaint refers to an allegation of unprofessional conduct. See definition infra.

Complained-against-judge is the person holding a military judicial assignment with either the
trial or appellate military court, who has had a complaint of misconduct filed against him or her.

Deliberative process is defined by the law related to Military Rules of Evidence Rule 509 as
follows: “Except as provided in Mil.R.Evid. 606, the deliberations of courts and grand and petit
juries are privileged to the extent that such matters are privileged in trial of criminal cases in the
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                               393


United States district courts, but the results of the deliberations are not privileged.”

Discipline means action taken pursuant to these rules and procedures as a result of the filing of a
complaint of unprofessional conduct on the part of a trial or appellate military judge.

Judge refers to a trial military judge who has been certified in accordance with Article 26,
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), or an appellate military judge assigned to the Air
Force Court of Criminal Appeals in accordance with Article 66, UCMJ, and who is assigned to
judicial duties on a full-time basis, or part-time basis (detailed to at least one case), at the time of
the alleged unprofessional conduct.

The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) refers to The Judge Advocate General of the United
States Air Force.

Judicial Inquiry Commission (JIC) is a one-judge or multi-judge body appointed by the Chief
Trial Judge or TJAG, as appropriate, to conduct an investigation into alleged unprofessional
conduct subsequent to a finding of sufficient cause.

Judicial privilege is a privilege in law applying to the judicial process, which protects the
confidentiality of communications among judges and their staff relating to official judicial
business, most particularly the deliberative processes, such as voting, the basis for a decision,
and the framing and researching of opinions, orders, and rulings.

Judicial Privilege Review Commission (JPRC) is an ad hoc body composed of judges
appointed by TJAG to resolve issues involving a claim of judicial privilege by trial or appellate
military judges.

Sufficient cause is the screening standard that must be met before a JIC is appointed to
investigate a complaint alleging unprofessional conduct. Sufficient cause to proceed means that
the complaint against the judge alleges unprofessional conduct.

Unprofessional conduct is any conduct that violates a provision of the Code. It does not
require a finding of a violation of the UCMJ. Examples of unprofessional conduct include, but
are not limited to:

1. conviction of a serious offense (felony or equivalent conviction);

2. willful misconduct in office (acting in bad faith while acting in a judicial capacity, including
the interference or attempted interference with the independence, integrity, or impartiality of the
judge);

3. willful misconduct which, although not related to judicial duties, brings the judicial office
into disrepute (minor criminal offenses);

4. conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice or conduct unbecoming a judicial officer,
whether conduct in office or outside of judicial duties, that brings the conduct that gives the
 394                                                                     AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


appearance of impropriety; and

5. any conduct that constitutes a violation of the rules of professional conduct for lawyers.

                                     V. INVESTIGATION

A. Confidentiality. Confidentiality is required during the initial investigatory procedures
undertaken pursuant to this regulation so that a judge is protected from frivolous complaints. If
all complaints were publicly announced, meritless complaints could have irreversible
ramifications not only for the complained-against-judge but for the military justice system as a
whole. Furthermore, confidentiality encourages litigants and attorneys to report their complaints
without fear of reprisal from the judge or other authority.

B. Judicial Privilege. The judicial privilege is a qualified privilege. A judge invoking a
claim of judicial privilege before a JIC has the burden of demonstrating that the matters under
inquiry fall within the confines of the privilege. Once the judge has met the burden, those
matters are presumptively privileged and need not be disclosed unless the JIC determines that its
need for the materials is sufficiently great to overcome the privilege.

        The privilege is qualified in that it must sometimes yield to other considerations. In
making that determination, the JIC will consider such factors as the importance of the inquiry for
which the privileged information is sought, the relevance of that information to its inquiry, and
the difficulty of obtaining the desired information through alternative means.

        The JIC must then weigh the demonstrated need for the information against the degree of
intrusion upon the confidentiality of privileged communications necessary to satisfy that need. If
the JIC determines that the qualified judicial privilege must yield, the JIC shall record its reasons
by making written essential findings.

        The complained-against-judge can appeal to the appointing authority the findings and
ruling of the JIC that the qualified judicial privilege must yield. The appointing authority must
consult on this issue with the JPRC. The appointing authority shall conduct a de novo review in
assessing the appeal of the JIC’s findings and ruling on judicial privilege. The appointing
authority shall advise the judge claiming the privilege of the appointing authority’s decision in
writing.

Judicial Council of the Eleventh Circuit v. Mercer, 783 F.2d 1438, 1520-1525 (11th Cir. 1986).

C. Judicial Ethics Advisory Council. During any stage of the investigation, the Judicial
Ethics Advisory Council may be consulted. The Judicial Ethics Advisory Council is composed
of three persons appointed by TJAG pursuant to Part III of this policy memorandum. The
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                             395


opinions of the Judicial Ethics Advisory Council are not binding.

D. Judicial Privilege Review Commission. Before the appointing authority determines that
any claim of judicial privilege must yield, he or she shall obtain an opinion from the JPRC.
TJAG shall appoint three Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals judges who should ordinarily be
of the same or higher grade as the complained-against-judge, to resolve a claim of judicial
privilege as a whole claims judicial privilege, a Commission composed of at least three judges
sitting on other service Courts of Criminal Appeals shall be appointed by TJAG with the
approval of the other service Judge Advocate Generals from whose service Courts of Criminal
Appeals the members are drawn.

E. Temporary Suspension Authority. The Chief Trial Judge, with respect to trial judges, or
TJAG, with respect to any judge, may temporarily suspend, without prejudice, a judge from the
performance of the judge’s judicial duties at any stage of an investigation into alleged judicial
misconduct.

F. Complaint Procedure.

1. Submission of Complaint.

a. Any person may submit a complaint, orally or in writing, giving a brief statement of the facts
constituting such conduct. Any complaint shall be forwarded to any judge advocate or law
specialist, preferably a staff judge advocate, legal officer, or military judge.

b. Any judge who believes that his or her judicial independence or integrity has been or is
being threatened, in addition to any other remedies available to him or her pursuant to Air Force
instructions, may submit a complaint to the Chief Trial Judge, if the complainant is a trial judge,
or to TJAG, if the complainant is the Chief Trial Judge or an appellate judge.

c. If the complaint received involves a judge’s concern that his or her judicial independence or
integrity has been or is being threatened by someone who is not a judge, such complaint shall be
processed in accordance with Articles 98 or 138, UCMJ, the Manual for Courts-Martial, or other
applicable Air Force instructions.

2. Referral of Complaint.

a. If the complained-against-judge is a trial judge, the officer receiving such complaint shall
forward it promptly to the Chief Trial Judge.

b. If the complained-against-judge is an appellate judge or the Chief Trial Judge, the officer
receiving such complaint shall forward it promptly to TJAG.

c. The Chief Trial Judge (unless he or she is the complained-against- judge) with respect to trial
judges, or TJAG with respect to any judge, may find, sua sponte, sufficient cause to appoint a
JIC.
 396                                                                   AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


3. Screening of Complaint.

a. Trial judges. Upon receipt of a complaint against a trial judge filed under paragraph 1a of
this subsection, the Chief Trial Judge, or his or her appointee (who must be a currently assigned
trial military judge or appointed appellate military judge, who should ordinarily be of the same or
higher grade as the complained-against-judge, and who must not be subordinate in the
performance rating chain to the complained-against-judge) shall promptly record the receipt of
the complaint and screen the complaint for sufficient cause.

b. Appellate judges or Chief Trial Judge. Upon receipt of a complaint against an appellate
military judge or the Chief Trial Judge filed under paragraph 1b of this subsection, TJAG or his
or her appointee (who must be a currently assigned trial military judge or appointed appellate
military judge, who should ordinarily be of the same or higher grade as the complained-against-
judge, and who must not be subordinate in the performance rating chain to the complained-
against-judge) shall promptly record the receipt of the complaint and screen the complaint for
sufficient cause.

4. Results of Screening. After the complaint has been expeditiously screened and a sufficient
cause determination made, the Chief Trial Judge, or TJAG, as appropriate, by written order
stating the reasons, may:

a. if there is not sufficient cause to proceed, dismiss the complaint and transmit copies of any
written order to the complainant, if known, and the complained-against-judge; or

b. if sufficient cause is found, refer the complaint to a JIC. Under R.C.M. 109(c)(4), prior to
the commencement of an initial inquiry, the complained- against-judge shall be notified that a
complaint has been filed and that an initial inquiry will be conducted.

G. Judicial Inquiry Commission.

1. Appointment. Where sufficient cause is found, the Chief Trial Judge, or TJAG, as
appropriate, shall appoint a JIC. The Chief Trial Judge may appoint himself or herself as the
JIC. If the Chief Trial Judge designates another judge as the JIC, or when TJAG appoints a
judge to a JIC, that judge must be a currently assigned military trial or appellate judge, who
should ordinarily be of the same or higher grade as the complained- against-judge, and who must
not be subordinate in the performance rating chain to the complained-against-judge. The JIC
shall investigate the complaint, and after giving the complained-against-judge the opportunity to
respond to the allegations, make findings of fact, including whether unprofessional conduct
occurred.

2. Conduct of investigation. The JIC appointed hereunder shall conduct an investigation
which is as extensive and as formal as it considers necessary, and shall expeditiously file a
comprehensive written report thereon with the Chief Trial Judge or TJAG, as appropriate. The
purpose of the JIC in conducting an investigation is solely to gather information, make findings
of fact based upon its evaluation of the evidence and information received, and submit a written
report of its investigation, including its findings of fact, to the authority who appointed it.
AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013                                                                           397



        Findings of fact must be as specific as possible, with each fact made a separate finding, if
possible. See R.C.M. 905(d). Findings of fact include finding that the allegation of
unprofessional conduct is or is not substantiated. The JIC shall not report opinions or
recommendations. It has the authority to administer oaths (see Article 136, UCMJ; AFI 51-504,
Legal Assistance, Notary, and Preventive Law Programs). The Military Rules of Evidence are
not binding but may be used as a guide. The complained-against-judge has no right to a
personal appearance before the JIC, nor a right of confrontation or cross-examination, but does
have the right to review all evidence against him or her and to present any matters to the JIC
before findings of fact are made.

    VI. ACTION ON THE REPORT OF THE JUDICIAL INQUIRY COMMISSION

Upon receipt of a report filed from a JIC, the Chief Trial Judge or TJAG, as appropriate, shall:

1. conduct or direct any additional investigation considered necessary;

2. approve or disapprove the findings or make findings of his or her own;
3. close the case and inform the complained-against-judge if he or she finds the alleged
unprofessional conduct is not substantiated;

4. take appropriate action if he or she finds the alleged unprofessional conduct is substantiated;

5. refer the matter to other authorities for appropriate disposition whether or not the allegation
of unprofessional conduct is or is not substantiated;

6. immediately provide written notice to the complainant, if known, that the matter has been
concluded; and

7. immediately notify the complained-against-judge of any action taken under this paragraph or
contemplated under Part VII.

     VII. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACTION BY THE CHIEF TRIAL JUDGE
                  OR THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL

A. Non-Adverse Action. Where the Chief Trial Judge or TJAG makes a final decision that
the allegation of unprofessional conduct is not substantiated, the case is closed.

B. Due Process Rights before Certain Adverse Actions are Taken. Where TJAG
determines that an allegation of unprofessional conduct has been substantiated and that he or she
may take adverse action that includes removal of the judge from his or her assignment as a trial
or appellate military judge, decertification from judicial duties, or referral to the complained-
against-judge’s state bar, then the complained-against-judge is entitled to written notice of the
contemplated adverse action, the assistance of counsel, the opportunity to submit a written
response, and the opportunity for a personal appearance before TJAG. The complained-against-
judge has 15 days after receipt of notification to inform TJAG of his or her decision to exercise
any and all of these due process rights.

                                        VIII. FINALITY

        TJAG’s decision to authorize further investigation is within his or her discretion and is
final. TJAG’s decision on the resolution of judicial privilege issues is final. TJAG’s decision
as to any adverse action taken pursuant to these rules and procedures relating to judicial
discipline is also final.

                                          Attachment 7
              THE AIR FORCE JUDICIAL ETHICS ADVISORY COUNCIL

I. ESTABLISHMENT

        A Judicial Ethics Advisory Council (Council) shall be established pursuant to Rule for
Courts-Martial 109(d) for the purpose of issuing advisory opinions on questions relating to the
propriety of judicial conduct under the Uniform Code of Judicial Conduct (the Code). Opinions
of the Council shall be provided to military judges at their request, Judicial Inquiry
Commissions, Judicial Privilege Review Commissions, or to persons or agencies designated by
The Judge Advocate General (TJAG) or his designee.

II. PURPOSE

        The Council shall provide advisory opinions on the scope and meaning of the Code and
its practical application.

III. COMPOSITION

        The Judicial Ethics Advisory Council shall be appointed by TJAG for a minimum of one
year. The Council shall be composed of at least three active duty or reserve judge advocates: one
will be a currently-certified military trial judge, one will be a currently-certified military
appellate judge, and one will be a judge advocate serving in another capacity. No member of the
Council may serve concurrently on a Judicial Inquiry Commission or a Judicial Privilege Review
Commission.

IV. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COUNCIL

       The Judicial Ethics Advisory Council shall:

(1) by the concurrence of a majority of its members, express, in writing, its opinion on the
propriety of judicial conduct with respect to the provisions of the Code;

(2) make periodic recommendations to TJAG for amendment of the Code; and

(3) adopt rules relating to the procedures to be used in expressing opinions, including rules to
assure a timely response to inquiries.

V. ACTION PENDING OPINION

        When the Council has been requested to provide an opinion concerning a question of
judicial ethics and there is an urgent need for resolution of the question such that the
administration of military justice may otherwise be impeded, the requesting judge should notify
the Council of the urgency for resolution of the question before it. The Council should then
provide an opinion expeditiously. An oral opinion followed by written confirmation is
acceptable. Pending an opinion of the Council, a judge should normally refrain from
 400                                                                    AFI51-201 6 JUNE 2013


participating in the conduct to which the question before the council relates. If some immediate
action is required, the judge should consider other procedures for resolution of the matter (e.g.,
notification of the parties, voir dire, or recusal).

VI. RELIANCE ON OPINIONS

        Opinions of the Council are not binding; however, TJAG and any Judicial Inquiry
Commission will consider any good faith reliance on a Council’s opinion in determining the
propriety of questioned judicial conduct that is the subject of a disciplinary proceeding. A judge
who has requested and complied with an opinion should not normally be disciplined for conduct
consistent with that opinion. A Council opinion may always be used as mitigation or, when
appropriate, as a defense.

VII. PUBLICATION

        Opinions issued pursuant to this rule shall be filed with the Office of TJAG. Such
opinions are confidential and not public information unless TJAG so directs. TJAG, however,
shall cause an edited version of each opinion to be prepared, in which the identity and
geographic location of the person who has requested the opinion, the specific court involved, and
the identity of other individuals, organizations or groups mentioned in the opinion are not
disclosed. Opinions so edited shall be published and circulated in a timely manner to all sitting
trial and appellate military judges. The Chief Trial Judge will number such opinions
consecutively and retain the record copy.

        In order to make these opinions available to other jurisdictions, each opinion should also
be reviewed and a determination made whether to send a copy to the Center for Judicial Conduct
Organizations. The Center for Judicial Conduct Organizations is an informational source and
study center for judicial discipline operated by the American Judicature Society (Web site:
http://www.ajs.org).
