                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. The 97th Operations Support Squadron (97 OSS) Weather Flight (WF) provides
or arranges weather services and support to the 97 AMW and other associate units assigned to
AAFB. The WF is the OPR for all weather services for AAFB. This instruction establishes
requirements and outlines duties and responsibilities of the WF and for reciprocal support
requirements with other AAFB agencies.
1.2. Implementation. This instruction covers daily operations to include exercise and
contingency operations. Unless superseded by Emergency War Orders (EWO), this instruction
will be followed during wartime operations.
1.3. Concept of Operations. The WF is the single point of contact for weather information and
will provide or arrange all weather services for units assigned to AAFB. The WF leverages the
support of the 26th Operational Weather Squadron (26 OWS) for 30-hour Terminal Aerodrome
Forecasts (TAFs), Meteorological Watch (METWATCH), resource protection, and flight
weather briefing services.
     1.3.1. Delineation of Duties. Weather duties are split between the WF and the 26 OWS.
     The WF is the focal point for all weather support at AAFB.
     1.3.2. Airfield Operating Hours. During airfield operating hours, the WF provides weather
     observations, “eyes-forward” support for the 26 OWS, Mission Weather Products (MWPs),
     METWATCH, Mission Watch (MISSIONWATCH), flight weather briefings, staff weather
     services, climatological data, observed warnings and advisories, Pilot-to-Metro-Service
     (PMSV) and resource protection. In addition, the WF maintains the capability and if
     required, augments the 26 OWS in producing Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF) and
     forecast watches, warning and advisories (WWAs).
     1.3.3. Airfield Closure Hours. During hours of airfield closure, weather services are
     provided by the 26 OWS IAW AFI 15-128, Air Force Weather Roles and Responsibilities.
     At a minimum, services provided include METWATCH, resource protection in the form of
     forecasted/observed WWAs, and flight weather briefing support. During hours of closure,
     the WF will have a technician on-call to provide weather support for severe weather events,
     operational/contingency missions, or any other resource protection issues.
     1.3.4. Contact Information. The physical location of the AAFB WF is 603 E Avenue,
     Building 185, Altus AFB, OK 73523. The official unit mailing address is 101 S. 6th Street,
     Altus AFB, OK 73523. The weather technician is available at DSN 866-7522 or commercial
     (580) 481-7522; Flight Chief: DSN 866-6837 or commercial (580) 481-6837; Flight
     Commander: DSN 866-5896 or commercial (580) 481-5896; FAX: DSN 866-7862 or
     commercial (580) 481-7862 and email 97oss.osw@us.af.mil.
1.4. Duty Priorities. The WF duty priorities are outlined in Table 1.1. These were developed
IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, Air and Space Weather Roles and Responsibilities-Exploitation.
These priorities exist to balance limited manning and mission critical tasks. Duty priorities focus
efforts during peak work periods prone to task saturation and priority conflicts. Weather
ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013                                                                   7


technicians will use sound judgment when complying with these duty priorities, especially where
there is imminent danger to life and property.

Table 1.1. WF Duty Priorities.
 Priority     Duties
 1            Perform Emergency War Order (EWO) Taskings
 2            Execute Weather Flight Evacuation/Continuity of Operations Procedures
 3            Respond to Aircraft/Ground Emergencies
 4            Provide Severe Weather Action Procedure (SWAP) Operations
 5            Respond to Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV) Contacts
 6            Provide Supervisor of Flying (SOF) support
 7            Provide Resource Protection (Issue Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories)
 8            Observe and Disseminate Surface Weather Observations Locally and Longline
 9            Conduct Coordinated METWATCH/MISSIONWATCH and “Eyes Forward” Support
              with the 26 OWS
 10           Disseminate Urgent (UUA) Pilot Reports (PIREPS)
 11           Prepare and Disseminate Mission Weather Products (MWPs)
 12           Disseminate Routine (UA) PIREPS Locally and Longline
 13           Provide MWP Briefing Support
 14           Provide Other Weather Products, Information, and Briefings
 15           Accomplish Weather Function Training
 16           Accomplish Administrative Tasks
1.5. Assumption of Duties. During significant outages and evacuation of the 26 OWS
facilities, responsibility for the AAFB TAF, WWAs and transient flight briefings will transfer to
the 97 OSS/OSW until back-up support is assumed by another Characterization Unit (CU).
1.6. Alternate Operating Location (AOL)/Continuity of Operations Procedures
(COOP). The WF maintains an AOL to continually provide/support weather requirements when
the primary duty location (weather station) is evacuated; however, the mission essential WF
personnel will NOT evacuate during exercises and will be available to provide continued support
under such conditions. Should conditions warrant the WF’s evacuation of the primary duty
location, the 26 OWS will assume all responsibilities for mission weather support briefings until
such time the WF can reestablish support capabilities.
      1.6.1. Location. The designated AOL is the 2nd Floor Conference/Training room within the
      Air Traffic Control (ATC) Tower (Building 525). To gain access to the ATC Tower, WF
      personnel will allow ATC personnel to scan/input Common Access Card (CAC) information
      into the Stanley Cipher Lock operating system. This access does not include access to the
      control tower room on the top floor. WF personnel will be removed from the cipher lock
      operating system for permanent change of station orders and deployments/Temporary Duty
      Assignments (TDYs) over 60 days.
      1.6.2. Communications. The AOL is equipped with Local Area Network (LAN)
      communications that mirror the primary WF duty location. HOT KEYS on the telephone
      located at the AOL provide immediate connectivity to the ATC Tower, Radar Approach and
      Control (RAPCON), Supervisor of Flying (SOF), 97 AMW Command Post (CP), and 26
      OWS. All WF contact numbers are identical to primary WF location. Additionally,
8                                                          ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013


    sufficient communication capabilities and references are available for maintaining the ability
    to communicate with other supported units. Computer LAN connectivity is also readily
    available.
    1.6.3. AOL Operations/COOP. In the event of an evacuation, support limitations will be
    highly dependent upon the operational status of LAN communications, the Joint
    Environmental Toolkit (JET) (the WF’s primary means of disseminating weather
    information), and/or the AN/FMQ-19 (the primary Automated Meteorological Observing
    System (AMOS)).
       1.6.3.1. The first priority is for the weather technician to take and disseminate augmented
       weather observations, assuming JET and AN/FMQ-19 systems are still operational and
       accessible, within 15 minutes of arriving at the AOL and during redeployment to the
       primary operating location IAW AFMAN 15-111, Surface Weather Observations.
       1.6.3.2. If the AN/FMQ-19 sensors or JET system is not operating, or there is no
       communication interface available to augment the observation, WF personnel will use the
       Kestrel 4500 and other back-up meteorological equipment or techniques to prepare
       observations. Additionally, all wind and pressure data will be estimated. The WF will
       contact ATC Tower, RAPCON, and 26 OWS with the most current observation data as it
       becomes available.
       1.6.3.3. Mission services will revert to the 26 OWS until the WF is able to re-establish
       mission services at the AOL. Once established, the mission weather technician will liaise
       with the 26 OWS, CP, SOF, and primary customers to resume mission services locally.
    1.6.4. The following limitations to normal weather services can be expected in the event of
    WF evacuation from the primary duty location:
       1.6.4.1. Briefing and/or forecasting services may be curtailed or temporarily suspended
       until additional manning can be recalled and work priorities allow. Aircrews can expect
       some briefing delays due to limited resources. They may be referred to the 26 OWS for
       briefing and planning support.
       1.6.4.2. Planning briefs, staff briefs, maintenance briefs, and any other previously
       coordinated mission support services may not capable of being supported from the AOL.
       1.6.4.3. Use of tactical meteorological equipment and limited access to satellite imagery,
       lightning detection, and WSR-88D radar equipment will likely degrade the accuracy and
       timeliness of some forecasts and observations.
       1.6.4.4. There is no direct PMSV capability for WF personnel. Prior to evacuating the
       weather station or immediately upon relocating to the AOL, the weather technician will
       contact the ATC tower and request they monitor the PMSV frequency (239.8 MHz) until
       the WF can return to the primary duty location. Weather personnel will request that ATC
       tower personnel pass PMSV contacts to WF personnel via phone patch.
       1.6.4.5.
ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013                                                                     9


Table 1.2. identifies the weather observing limitations from the AOL.

Table 1.2. AOL Observing Limitations
 #    Limitation
 1    The ATC tower AOL room has one small window facing the runway. Rapid changes in the
      weather (i.e., the start and stop of precipitation) may go unnoticed for a short time.
 2    Buildings, parked aircraft and trees block portions of the sky as well as ground visibility
      reference markers, especially north through northeast.
 3    There are few adequate ground visibility reference markers beyond 1 ½ miles. This especially
      degrades determination of nighttime visibility.

1.7. Operating Assumptions.
     1.7.1. The WF assumes adequate resources, communications, personnel, and facilities will
     be available to execute all AAFB weather support requirements.
     1.7.2. The 26 OWS assumes adequate resources, communications, and facilities will be
     available to execute the identified requirements outlined on the 26 OWS-97 OSS/OSW
     Installation Data Page, and there will be sufficient weather information available on which to
     base weather operations and production.
1.8. Release of Weather Data to Non-Department of Defense (DOD) Agencies and
Individuals. No weather data will be released to non-DOD agencies or personnel without the
express approval of 97 AMW Public Affairs (97 AMW/PA) and/or 97 AMW Staff Judge
Advocate (97 AMW/JA) legal offices.
1.9. Additional Weather Support. Direct all requests for additional weather support to WF
leadership (Flight Commander and/or Flight Chief). WF leadership will arrange or direct
services IAW this instruction, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) directives, AFIs,
AFMANs, and AFPDs.

                            WEATHER FLIGHT OPERATIONS

2.1. WF Responsibilities. The WF is the single point of contact for weather information at
AAFB. It provides and/or arranges all strategic, operational, and tactical-level weather
information for AAFB and its tenant units.
   2.1.1. The WF Commander (WF/CC) and/or Flight Chief provides or arranges for all
   weather support and services to AAFB and its tenant units IAW AFI 15-128.
2.2. Hours of Operation.
   2.2.1. The WF will have personnel on duty when supported units are performing their
   primary operation, duty, or mission and/or when ATC is open and no automated observing
   system capability exists. The WF sustains 24-hour operations Monday through Friday
   (beginning 0000L Monday through the end of flying Friday). Additionally, WF personnel
   will be on duty as required on weekends and holidays to support mission requirements.
      2.2.1.1. A WF technician will be on stand-by beginning at the end of flying Friday
      through 2359L the following Sunday night, and is charged to respond to WWAs issued
      by 26 OWS during weather station closure.
      2.2.1.2. The WF is not required to be on duty when ATC is closed, unless Severe
      Weather Action Procedures (SWAP) have been implemented and it is necessary to
      provide the “eyes forward” function, or to supplement for tornadic activity. See
      paragraph 5.2.4.1 for further details.
      2.2.1.3. WF leadership will notify the 26 OWS Operations Superintendent or Regional
      Flight Commander/NCOIC when temporary changes to duty hours occur (i.e., Family
      Day, Training Day, other closures/extensions). This notification will be made NLT 24
      hours in advance of closure to allow the 26 OWS to reallocate resources, as required.
   2.2.2. During hours of airfield closure, the 26 OWS will provide METWATCH, resource
   protection, and flight weather briefing services for AAFB. The WF maintains at least one
   weather technician on stand-by at all times to be recalled for duty while the airfield is closed.
   2.2.3. When the WF closes, the weather technician transfers resource protection
   responsibilities and flight weather briefings (as applicable) to the 26 OWS and notifies the 97
   AMW/CP. Upon returning to duty, the weather technician will call the above agencies to
   reclaim responsibility, to include gaining environmental situational awareness of current and
   forecast conditions, discussing any active/imminent resource protection products and
   receiving a handover of flight briefing responsibility from the 26 OWS.
   2.2.4. In the event any of the following criteria is met at scheduled closure time, the WF will
   not close until the criteria is no longer a factor.
      2.2.4.1. A watch or warning has been issued by the 26 OWS for severe weather as
      defined in Table 7.1.
      2.2.4.2. AAFB airfield remains open for any other reason.
2.3. Stand-by Weather Technician Recall.
ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013                                                                  11


   2.3.1. The WF maintains a weather technician on-call to respond to significant weather
   events after hours (normally weekends and holidays when no flying is otherwise scheduled).
   This technician is available to be recalled anytime the 26 OWS issues watches or warnings
   for severe weather as defined in Table 7.1 or WF leadership notifies him/her of a need
   (operational, meteorological, or as per 97 AMW/CP or 26 OWS) to reopen. Upon recall, the
   stand-by weather technician will report to the weather station and will notify the 26 OWS
   and the 97 AMW/CP upon arrival.
   2.3.2. In the event any of the following criteria occur during airfield closure hours, the on-
   call weather technician will be recalled.
       2.3.2.1. A watch or warning has been issued by the 26 OWS for severe weather as
       defined in Table 7.1.
       2.3.2.2. Airfield movements require the airfield to open for departures or arrivals.
       2.3.2.3. AAFB airfield is required to open for any reason.
2.4. Meteorological Equipment. The WF uses a wide range of equipment to determine the
current state of the atmosphere. These critical systems are used continuously to provide
customers with the most timely, accurate and relevant weather intelligence possible. Below is the
meteorological equipment installed and utilized by the WF
   2.4.1. WSR-88D Open Principal User Processor (OPUP) also known as Next Generation
   Radar (NEXRAD). The WF is a principal member of the Unit Radar Committee for the
   NEXRAD Radar Product Generator (RPG) located in Norman, OK. The WF uses the OPUP,
   which displays graphic and alphanumeric data critical to the timely detection of severe
   weather (i.e., tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and heavy precipitation). The OPUP obtains
   data via a dedicated digital line to the RPG and is the most important piece of equipment for
   the WF in terms of maintenance/communications restorative priorities. The WF maintains the
   OPUP while the radar and RPG are maintained by the National Weather Service (NWS). If
   the OPUP is inoperative, some backup radar data is available over the internet.
   2.4.2. AN/FMQ-19 Automated Meteorological Observing System. The AN/FMQ-19 is an
   integrated system of multiple weather sensors and data automation components that
   continually measure environmental conditions to provide responsive, reliable, accurate, real-
   time weather data to all supported agencies. The AN/FMQ-19 measures airfield weather
   conditions to include, but not limited to wind direction, wind speed, present weather, runway
   visual range, visibility, cloud heights as well as coverage, temperature, dew point
   temperature, atmospheric pressure, and lightning detection. Refer to Attachment 7 for sensor
   locations.
2.5. Communications Equipment.
   2.5.1. Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) is the Air Force’s primary weather communication
   and dissemination computer system. Air Force Weather (AFW) units utilize the JET
   hardware and web based software to transmit data to, and receive data from weather agencies
   worldwide via the internet.
       2.5.1.1. The JET system consists of a dedicated collection sensor device, maintained by
       the 97th Communications Squadron (97 CS) IAW 24 AF-AF/A3OW-JET Project
       Management Office (PMO) Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), along with hardware
 12                                                          ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013


         that allows for a connection to the AAFB Airfield Automation System (AFAS) or IDS-5
         server located in the RAPCON facility. Theses servers, integrated through the LAN,
         provide weather information to both the ATC tower and RAPCON. Additionally, the 26
         OWS has the capability to access the JET system in the absence of WF personnel.
         2.5.1.2. The WF and 26 OWS use JET locally to disseminate observations, forecasts, and
         WWAs to the CP, ATC agencies, and the Maintenance Operations Control Center
         (MOC). If there are any JET system malfunctions, that office should immediately inform
         the WF for troubleshooting and repair. If the WF cannot resolve the outage they will
         refer the problem to the JET Help Desk at Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), and will
         track the outage daily until the issue is resolved.
         2.5.1.3. JET outages can range from partial to catastrophic impacts to AAFB operations.
         For JET back-up procedures, refer to paragraph 5.3 for observation dissemination;
         paragraph 5.4.3 for TAF dissemination; and paragraph 7.12 for WWA dissemination.
      2.5.2. PMSV. The WF is assigned frequency 239.8 MHz for PMSV. See paragraph 4.6 for
      more information on PMSV.
      2.5.3. Local Area Network (LAN). The LAN is a vital tool for the WF. Information
      available over the internet and intranet is used to acquire weather data to provide mission
      essential briefings and forecasts. In the event of LAN failure, all services are significantly
      degraded.
      2.5.4. Telephone. The WF has several multi-line phones in the operations area, with many
      others nearby that can be used to relay information. Telephones in the operations area also
      have hotlines to the ATC Tower, RAPCON, SOF, CP, and AMOPS, and MOC.
2.6. The WF Web Page. Online WF products may be obtained through the 97 AMW
SharePoint      site     https://97amw.portal.altus.af.mil/sites/OG/oss/weather/default.aspx.
Products include, but are not limited to Altus AFB Climatology, 5-Day Forecast, and MWPs.
2.7. Facility Power. The WF offices have an independent back-up power generator in the event
of a total electrical outage. The generator is maintained by the 97th Civil Engineer Squadron
(CES), and CES is the point of contact for associated power or any other Bldg. 185 issues.
2.8. WF Limitations.
      2.8.1. AN/FMQ-19 Sensor Limitations.
         2.8.1.1. The official point of observation is the active AN/FMQ-19 sensor. The sensor
         may not always represent conditions throughout the entire base or along runway approach
         tracks.
         2.8.1.2. The AN/FMQ-19 lacks the capability to detect and report all specified airfield
         visibility minima criteria specified in Attachment 2. The system reports visibility in 1/4
         statute mile (SM) increments up to 2 SM and the 1/2 SM increments up to 3 SM.
         2.8.1.3. The following conditions may degrade the accuracy of the AN/FMQ-19 sensor
         readings.
             2.8.1.3.1. The AAFB airfield complex is surrounded from the Northwest through
             South by open irrigated fields causing localized dense fog.
ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013                                                                 13


         2.8.1.3.2. Grass surrounds all AN/FMQ-19 sensor sites.
         2.8.1.3.3. The 35R sensors have a shallow ditch/creek of water that affects
         visibility/RVR sensors.
  2.8.2. Augmentation Limitations.
     2.8.2.1. When weather technicians perform augmentation duties from the weather
     station, the official point of observation is located on the south side of Bldg 185 next to
     the back-up rain gauge. See paragraph 5.2.3 for additional augmentation limitations.
     2.8.2.2. When augmenting from the AOL, the official point of observation is around the
     ATC Tower. Refer to Table 1.2 for AOL observing limitations.
  2.8.3. The WF has coordinated a Cooperative Weather Watch with AAFB ATC and other
  appropriate base agencies and is reliant on weather data passed to construct representative
  weather reports. See paragraph 5.7 for details on the Cooperative Weather Watch.
  2.8.4. Optimum forecast and observing support is dependent on fully operational
  communication and meteorological sensing equipment.
  2.8.5. The AN/FMQ-19 lightning detection system is used to determine the approximate
  direction and distance of lightning strikes around the airfield complex. Equipment
  limitations and operational status would limit lightning detection.
  2.8.6. Certain services, such as staff briefings and SOF training may not be available without

                                      MISSION SERVICES

4.1. General. Mission services are administered by the WF in conjunction with the 26 OWS
directly relating to the mission of the 97 AMW and its tenant units. This chapter explains
AAFB’s mission weather support including METWATCH, MISSIONWATCH, Resource
Protection, Disaster Support, Forecast Verification, Tactical Decision Aid Support, Mission
Weather Products (MWPs), and the respective dissemination processes.
      4.1.1. Duty Hours. Mission services are provided Monday through Friday (beginning 0000L
      Monday through the end of flying Friday). Services are not normally provided on weekends,
      federal holidays, training holidays or when the airfield is closed.
      4.1.2. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). The WF and 26 OWS conduct METWATCH
      to provide controlled and organized situational awareness of the current and future
      meteorological situation for AAFB. The WF serves in an “eyes forward” role to collaborate
      and advise with the 26 OWS on current conditions and how they may affect weather
      products. Upon detecting an un-forecast change, weather technicians will notify all
      supported units and begin the process to amend the forecast and/or Mission Weather
      Products (MWPs).
      4.1.3. MISSIONWATCH. The WF will monitor aerospace weather during specific missions
      focusing on mission-limiting meteorological impacts to ongoing military operations as
      described in Table 4.1.

4.2. Mission Weather Products (MWPs). The WF produces a suite of MWPs to include the
Mission Execution Forecast (MEF), flight weather briefings, MEF-1s, and DD Form 175-1s.
See Attachment 10 for sample products, formats, delivery methods, and decoding information.
      4.2.1. MEF. The primary MWP produced by the WF is the MEF. The MEF is developed
      using a constant two-tiered approach of both administrative and operational processes as
      outlined in AFMAN 15-129V2. During these processes, WF personnel create the MEF by
      fusing and tailoring products created by strategic and regional weather centers, as well as
      information supplied by local units and agencies. The end result is a product designed to
      provide timely, accurate and relevant weather information to customers. MEFs must be
      horizontally consistent with, but not necessarily mirror, products issued by the 26 OWS and
      AFWA. During rapidly changing conditions, the WF will amend the MEF to reflect accurate
      conditions and brief the customer, then back-brief 26 OWS if crossing TAF categories IAW
ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013                                                                      17


   duty priorities. MEFs are developed daily to support the 97 AMW flying missions and are
   available at the forecast counter located in Bldg 185 or electronically on the WF SharePoint
   page. These briefings are typically prepared within three hours of designated briefing times
   supplying mission weather data for AAFB aircrews as indicated on daily flight schedules.
   The MEF will be amended for mission impacting criteria that are observed or later forecast to
   decrease to less than, or if below, increase to equal or exceed any of the values outlined in
   Table A8.12.
   4.2.2. AAFB Planning Weather. A generated product provided by the WF and is provided
   for mission planning and training and is NOT amended. This information is issued during
   swing shift for the next flying day.
       4.2.2.1. Local Planning Weather. Weather data is in TAF format to include clouds,
       visibility, weather, winds, hazards and solar-lunar data. In addition, a two-hour
       breakdown of forecast maximum temperature, minimum altimeter, and pressure altitude
       is provided.
       4.2.2.2. Air Refueling Routes. General forecast conditions broken down by AR track
       identifying sky condition at flight level, forecast visibility, winds at several flight levels
       and whether turbulence, icing and/or thunderstorms are expected on the route.
       Temperature and temperature deviation are also produced.
       4.2.2.3. Military Training Routes. Weather information is forecast for a 24-48 hour valid
       time broken into 4-hour increments. Cloud cover, to include bases and tops, and any
       forecast hazards are drawn on DOD Area Planning Military Training Route maps and
       posted to the SharePoint weather page. Forecast winds/temperatures are provided for
       flight levels 005, 010, 015, 030, 050 and 100.
       4.2.2.4. Transition Bases. Weather data is in TAF format to include clouds, visibility,
       weather, winds, and hazards. In addition, a four-hour breakdown of forecast maximum
       temperature, minimum altimeter and pressure altitude is provided.
       4.2.2.5. Dropzones. Weather data is in TAF format to include clouds, visibility, weather,
       winds, and hazards. In addition, forecast winds/temperatures are provided for surface,
       flight levels 005, 010, 015, and 030.
   4.2.3. Take off/Landing Planning Data. Automatically generated each time the MEF is
   updated. This product is created for AAFB, Clinton Sherman, and Amarillo. Information is
   broken into 2-hour increments to indicate temperature, altimeter, pressure altitude and winds
   for all locations. Hard copies are available on the forecaster counter in the WF.
   4.2.4. MEF-1. These off-station flight weather briefings are developed utilizing the WF
   MEF. They are available to the aircrew at the WF forecast counter located in Bldg 185 or
   may be electronically disseminated directly to the aircrew via e-mail or fax. The WF
   prepares these briefings upon request and/or 97 AMW missions that require an aircraft to
   remain over night at another airfield.
4.3. Flight Weather Briefings (FWBs). The WF will provide FWBs to all aircrew as duty
priorities permit. Aircrews of non-scheduled flights and/or transient aircrews should request
FWBs from the WF at least 2 hours prior to brief time. The WF will provide a MEF, DD 175-1
FWB, or verbal briefing to all aircrews, as duty priorities allow.

  supported unit provides advanced notification of intent to conduct operations, and the WF is
  unable to provide MWPs.
  4.3.4. The WF will coordinate requests for briefing support with the 26 OWS on larger
  flying operations when the WF cannot provide MWPs to the supported unit(s) due to
  manning levels or temporary duty commitments.
 4.3.5. Transient Aircrew Services. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, transient aircrews requesting
 support from the WF will receive a briefing or update to an existing briefing form IAW duty
 priorities. In the event WF is unable to provide transient aircrew support, then the aircrew
 will be directed to the dedicated Airfield Operations-maintained web-based briefing terminal
 located in the flight planning room in Bldg 185 or access to a computer to self-brief or
 schedule a flight weather briefing from the 26 OWS. The WF leadership maintains a
 Transient Aircrew Weather Support binder located in the flight planning room. This
 provides detailed contact information and instructions on accessing/navigating the 26 OWS
 web site. The 26 OWS stands ready to brief any transient aircrew 24 hours-a-day and may
 also be reached Commercial (318) 529-2651/2652/2653 or DSN 331-2651/2652/2653; by

       4.3.5.2. Air Combat Command Air Operations Squadron (ACC AOS) Controlled
       Missions. If tasked to support launch, alternate, abort and destination bases for ACC
       AOS-controlled missions, the WF will brief aircrews using ACC AOS/AOSW Controlled
       Mission Weather products (CMWPs), coordinate deviations from CMWPs with ACC
       AOS/AOSW, and debrief arriving aircrews at destination bases and report any deviations
       from the CMWP (weather not as forecast) to ACC AOS/AOSW.
4.4. Forecast Amendments. Amendment criteria are defined as mission weather thresholds
that will impact completion of a mission.
   4.4.1. Required Amendments. The thresholds identified in Table A8.12 are considered to be
   required amendment criteria from 1 hour prior to takeoff times until the mission is complete.
   Amendments will be issued as soon as possible IAW duty priorities.
   4.4.2. Representative Amendments. Forecasts may be amended at any other time the WF
   deems it to be unrepresentative of the current or forecast conditions at any location on the
   MEF.
4.5. Forecast Verification. The WF and 26 OWS conduct post-mission analysis of their
forecasts to verify the operational effectiveness of their processes/procedures, which aids in
identifying areas of needed improvement and the base-line for the metrics program.
   4.5.1. Metrics Programs. Although the WF provides most of the verification data utilized by
   the 26 OWS, both units maintain separate metrics programs.
       4.5.1.1. WF Metrics. Derived from real-time meteorological data, PIREPS, and aircrew
       feedbacks, the WF metrics program compiles the information provided into graphical
       form. Monthly metrics notifications will be sent to 97 OG Workflow, 54 ARS/DO, 58
       AS/DO, Altus 730 AMTS Workflow and 97 OSS/DO via email and is uploaded to the
       AETC/A3OW Community of Practice (CoP) and WF SharePoint page. The MEF will
       also be tailored to incorporate metrics.
       4.5.1.2. 26 OWS Metrics. The 26 OWS verifies its TAF and watch/warning lead-times
       versus false-alarm rates. Each month the 26 OWS posts warning and watch metrics onto
       their                                    web                                    page
       https://ows.barksdale.af.mil/Tech_Ref/metrics/index.cfm?UID=&BW=H&UF=M&

      4.5.2. MWP Reviews. The WF will conduct MWP reviews to improve forecast capabilities
      and processes. These will be forwarded to AETC/A3OW and if warranted to the 26 OWS
      for inclusion in local training.
4.6. Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV). The WF provides weather observations and forecasts to
aircrews, while in flight or on the taxiway, using the PMSV radio (239.8 MHz) or via phone
patch via the CP or ATC tower. By giving weather personnel PIREPs over the PMSV, aircrews
enhance situational awareness to atmospheric conditions experienced in data-sparse areas.
      4.6.1. When contacted by aircrew on the PMSV, the WF will provide timely, relevant and
      accurate weather data to include observations, forecasts, and/or WWAs.
      4.6.2. During WF closures and extended outages, aircrews may obtain PMSV briefs from the
      26 OWS via phone patch by dialing Commercial (318) 529-2651/2652/2653 or DSN 331-
      2651/2652/2653.
      4.6.3. The WF will solicit a PIREP during each PMSV contact with aircrew, and will log it
      on the PMSV/Reliable Source Log. PIREPs are a tool for aircrews to help the WF better
      serve them and enhance flight safety.
      4.6.4. Outages. The WF will notify ATC personnel of any PMSV outage and request
      assistance in monitoring frequency 239.8 MHz. Additionally, the WF will contact 97
      OSS/OSAA AMOPS to annotate long term outages via Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) until
      repairs are complete. During WF PMSV outages, aircrews can contact the WF via phone
      patch at DSN 866-7522, Commercial (580) 481-7522, via the 97 AMW/CP at frequency
      349.0 MHz and then phone patch to the WF; or via the ATC tower frequency 255.6 MHz and
      then phone patch to the WF. Once PMSV service is restored, the WF technician will notify
      the back-up agency that the WF assumes full PMSV support and AMOPS to cancel the
      NOTAM.
4.7. Space Weather. The WF provides space weather impacts on each MWP focusing on
communications and navigation systems to include High Frequency (HF), Ultra High Frequency
(UHF), and Global Positioning Systems (GPS).
      4.7.1. Space weather products are produced and available directly from the Air Force
      Weather Web Service (AFW-WEBS) page via links from the WF SharePoint page or the 26
      OWS web page. Sample space weather products and descriptions are found in Attachment
      11.
      4.7.2. The WF SharePoint page contains a link to the CONUS space weather products page.
      The WF will submit any reported space weather impacts through the AFW-WEBS. For more
      information about space weather products, please contact the WF.
      4.7.3. Local Space Weather Criteria. The criteria listed in Tables 4.3-4.6 are used in the

                                     AIRFIELD SERVICES

5.1. Airfield Services. Airfield Services include those actions and areas that affect AAFB.
Airfield Services include weather observing, resource protection (WWAs), and PMSV support.
Observing services include providing “Eyes Forward” support to the 26 OWS. “Eyes Forward”
support is defined as WF personnel relaying all significant, time-sensitive meteorological
information to the 26 OWS.
5.2. Weather Observations. Observations will be taken and disseminated IAW AFMAN 15-
111. The AN/FMQ-19 is the AF standard system for automated observations, with WF
technicians augmenting the system when required. While in automated mode, the AN/FMQ-19
continually senses and reports the following weather elements:                 wind, visibility,
precipitation/obstructions to vision, cloud height, sky cover, temperature, dew point, altimeter
(ALSTG), and lightning. Note: The FMQ-19 reports weather elements over a more limited area,
concentrating on the approach end of the active runway. The AN/FMQ-19 takes readings every
minute, and uses time averaging of elements for more consistent observations.
      5.2.1. Types of Observations. There are three types of observations: Aviation Routine
      Weather Report (METAR), Special (SPECI) Observations, and Local (LOCAL)
      Observations. All observations are taken from the official observation point.
         5.2.1.1. METAR (Routine Meteorological Observation Report). A METAR is a
         regularly scheduled observation taken and disseminated every hour at 55-59 minutes after
         the hour. A METAR observation may also include special weather criteria that were met
         during the given observing period. METAR observations are disseminated locally and
         longline.
         5.2.1.2. SPECI (Special Observation). A SPECI is an unscheduled observation taken
         and disseminated when any special criteria in AFMAN 15-111 or local criteria listed in
         Attachment 2 has been observed. SPECI reports will be prepared and transmitted after
         the last relevant criteria is observed and will be disseminated locally and longline.
         5.2.1.3. LOCAL (Local Observation). A LOCAL is an unscheduled observation,
         reported to the nearest minute during back-up of the AMOS pressure sensor. LOCAL
         altimeter setting observations are taken at an interval not to exceed 35 minutes when
         there has been a change of 0.01 inch Hg (0.3 hPa) or more since the last ALSTG value.
         A METAR or SPECI taken within the established time interval will meet this
         requirement. LOCALs are taken and disseminated to ATC agencies as soon as possible
         after the relevant altimeter setting change is observed.
      5.2.2. Official Point of Observation. The official point of observation is the active
      AN/FMQ-19 sensor. When augmenting the AN/FMQ-19, the point of observation is located
      on the south side of Bldg 185 next to the back-up rain gauge. The cab in the weather station
      may be used by weather personnel to determine ceiling and visibility elements. When
      augmenting from the AOL, the official point of observation is around the ATC tower.
      5.2.3. Backup Observation Site Limitations. The official point of observation located on the
      south side of Building 185 near the rain gauge does not allow a clear, unobstructed 360
ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013                                                                   25


   degree view around the runway complex. The technician’s view from southwest through
   north is obstructed by trees, buildings, and hangars. The obstructions interfere with accurate
   visibility measurements and may obscure features moving in from the stated directions.
   Aircraft engine noise may impede the forecaster’s ability to hear thunder. High intensity
   lights located around the airfield complex and security lights on nearby buildings hinder the
   technician’s ability to determine sky condition and visibility at night. For AOL observing
   limitations,                                      refer                                     to
   Table 1.2.
   5.2.4. AN/FMQ-19 Operations. The WF will operate the AN/FMQ-19 in full automated
   mode to provide the official METAR and SPECI observations for AAFB, except when
   augmentation is required IAW AFMAN 15-111 and/or this publication.
      5.2.4.1. Augmentation. Augmentation is the process of having position-qualified
      weather technicians manually add or edit data to observations generated by a properly
      sited AMOS such as the AN/FMQ-19.             The two augmentation processes are
      supplementing and back-up.
          5.2.4.1.1. Supplementing.    Supplementing is a method of manually adding
          meteorological information to an automated observation that is beyond the capability
          of the AN/FMQ-19 to detect and/or report.
              5.2.4.1.1.1. Technicians will perform a Basic Weather Watch (BWW) and be
              prepared to supplement observations when the airfield is open and the conditions
              in Table 5.1 are observed and/or are forecast to occur within 1 hour.
              5.2.4.1.1.2. Technicians will be ready to perform a BWW and be prepared to
              supplement observations when the airfield is open and the visibility is less than 3
              SM and/or is forecast to occur within 1 hour.
              5.2.4.1.1.3. Technicians are required to log on to JET, place JET in augment
              mode, and be prepared to supplement whenever a watch or warning has been
              issued for tornadic activity.
              5.2.4.1.1.4. Technicians will only supplement the automated weather observation
              during airfield closure hours when SWAP has been implemented and it is
              necessary to provide the eyes forward function or whenever a watch or warning
              has been issued for tornadic activity.
              5.2.4.1.1.5. Technicians always take Operational Risk Management (ORM) into
              consideration when deciding whether or not to supplement observations. Safety
              of the technician always comes first and safety of flight and resource protection is
              paramount.
              5.2.4.1.1.6. Immediate reporting of a tornado or funnel cloud takes precedence
              over other phenomena.

 Volcanic Ash (VA)
 Ice Pellets (IP)
 Snow Depth (4/sss)
 (only during airfield operating hours and if heavy snow warning has been issued and
 snowfall is occurring)
          5.2.4.1.2. Back-up. Back-up is the method of manually providing meteorological
          data and/or dissemination to an AN/FMQ-19 observation when the primary
          automated method is not operational or unavailable due to sensor and/or
          communication failure. Technicians use guidance in AFMAN 15-111, Para. 3.4 and
          Attachments 2 and 3 to determine which observation elements to back-up.
              5.2.4.1.2.1. There is no requirement to back-up the system/sensor when the
              airfield is closed. However, the technician will back-up the system/sensor (as
              needed) when recalled to perform SWAP operations.
              5.2.4.1.2.2. When an AN/FMQ-19 sensor is no longer working properly, the
              technician will ensure supported ATC agencies are notified of all outages prior to
              contacting any maintenance agency. Once notifications are made, technicians
              will make every attempt to report the outage and perform back-up on logged out
              sensor(s) until fixed. The technician will enter the corrected or missing
              element(s) in the METAR/SPECI.
              5.2.4.1.2.3. Altimeter Updates. When backing up the AN/FMQ-19 pressure
              sensor, ALSTG update LOCALs will be taken at an interval not to exceed 35
              minutes when there has been a change of 0.01 inch Hg (0.3 hPa) or more since the
              last reported ALSTG value. A METAR or SPECI taken within the established
              time interval meets this requirement. LOCALs are taken and disseminated to
              ATC agencies as soon as possible after the relevant altimeter setting change is
              observed.
       5.2.4.2. The technician will maintain situational awareness of local weather conditions
       and the AN/FMQ-19 observations during airfield operating hours. Weather technicians
       will also monitor area observation and forecast products to keep abreast of changes
       expected to affect AAFB.
   5.2.5. Weather Watch. The AN/FMQ-19 system performs a Continuous Weather Watch
   (CWW). When the FMQ-19 requires augmentation, WF personnel will conduct a BWW (see
   paragraph 5.6).
5.3. Back-up Dissemination Procedures. During JET or communications outages, the WF will
disseminate weather observations locally to agencies shown in Table 5.2 (in order), and record
dissemination on Local Dissemination Log. During extended outages when JET is down, the
WF will send observations longline via the AFW-WEBS website. If the network is down or the
webpage is not working, technicians will call another weather unit or the 26 OWS for assistance
in transmitting products longline via AFW-WEBS. “Eyes-forward” support to the 26 OWS will
also continue via telephone.

5.4. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF).
   5.4.1. AAFB TAFs are produced and disseminated by the 26 OWS. For TAF format,
   specification, and amendment criteria, see Attachment 4. TAFs are issued at the times
   outlined in this instruction.
   5.4.2. TAFs are issued at the following times when the airfield is open and in conjunction
   with MEF production times: 0900 Zulu (Z) [(0400L Central Daylight Time (CDT)/0300L
   Central Standard Time (CST)]; 1700Z (1200L CDT/1100L CST); and 0100Z (1900L
   CDT/1800L CST).
   5.4.3. The 26 OWS disseminates the TAF locally and longline utilizing JET; however,
   forecast information is available via the internet through various weather-related websites.
   Once the TAF has been disseminated, it is viewable by all JET users on AAFB. In the event
   of a 26 OWS JET malfunction, the 26 OWS will contact the WF, which will in-turn
   disseminate the TAF. If the event is a widespread JET failure, the WF will contact 26 OWS,
   obtain the TAF, and email, fax, or phone to ATC agencies (Tower and RAPCON).
   5.4.4. The WF will maintain and periodically exercise with 26 OWS, the ability to produce
   TAFs if for any reason the 26 OWS is incapable of providing this service.
   5.4.5. TAF amendments are described in Attachment 4. Amendment criteria are based on
   airfield minima and conditions that meet WWA criteria.
   5.4.6. The AAFB MEF is considered the official flight planning forecast for the 97 AMW.
5.5. Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. The 26 OWS and the WF perform resource
protection for AAFB. Resource protection is detailed in Chapter 7.
5.6. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). A BWW will be conducted when the airfield is open and
during periods when any of the mandatory augmentation of the AN/FMQ-19 is required. Due to
these other weather duties, weather technicians on duty may not detect and report all weather
changes as they occur. The BWW observing program has been implemented to establish the
minimum requirements needed to ensure the proper level of weather watch is maintained.
During a BWW, weather technicians will recheck weather conditions, at intervals not to exceed
20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to determine the need for a SPECI observation,
when any of the conditions listed in Tables 5.3-5.5 are observed to be occurring or are forecast to
occur within 1 hour.

5.7. Cooperative Weather Watch. The WF will maintain a Cooperative Weather Watch
program with ATC personnel, SOF, 97th Security Forces Squadron (SFS), and Flying
Squadrons. Of primary concern is the report of tower visibility different from the prevailing
surface visibility, local PIREPS and any occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions
that could affect flight safety or be critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations
and resources.
ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013                                                                 29


  5.7.1. A WF technician will:
     5.7.1.1. Provide training and certify ATC personnel as limited weather observers.
     Training, at a minimum will include:
         5.7.1.1.1. Evaluating and reporting tower visibility to the WF when tower visibility is
         less than 4 Statute Miles (SM) and is different from surface prevailing visibility.
         5.7.1.1.2. PMSV procedures.
         5.7.1.1.3. Decoding surface weather observations and forecasts.
     5.7.1.2. Provide WF orientation for the ATC personnel and SOF upon request.
     5.7.1.3. Evaluate weather information provided by ATC personnel to determine that
     AN/FMQ-19 data is accurate. If AN/FMQ-19 data is determined to be erroneous, ATC
     agencies will be notified first and then it will be logged out IAW back-up procedures
     outlined in paragraph 5.2.4.1.2.
     5.7.1.4. Evaluate information received from aircraft in the local pattern for possible
     inclusion into MEF, surface observations, and/or PIREPS.
     5.7.1.5. Relay all PIREPS to the 26 OWS.
  5.7.2. ATC personnel and SOF, as applicable, will:
     5.7.2.1. Review the cooperative weather watch training seminar. Once complete, they
     will complete a written exam. A certified 7-level (or higher) weather technician will
     grade the test and conduct a review of any missed questions with the trainee. A
     minimum score of 90% is required for passing. After passing the written exam, ATC
     personnel certification is documented in the individual’s training record.
     5.7.2.2. Notify the WF when tower visibility is less than 4 SM and is different from
     prevailing surface visibility.
     5.7.2.3. When duties permit, notify the WF when lightning is first observed, thunder is
     heard, obscuring phenomenon (i.e., fog, haze, smoke), precipitation is first
     observed/stops, or ceiling/sky cover appears to rise, lower, or dissipate to a degree that
     would result in a change to the airfield status (i.e., Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)/Visual
     Flight Rules (VFR)).
     5.7.2.4. Relay PIREPS to WF personnel for dissemination and possible incorporation
     into local weather products (observations, MWP) no later than 5 minutes after receipt.
     5.7.2.5. Notify the WF of any active runway changes.
     5.7.2.6. Report changes in the high intensity runway light (HIRL) setting to the weather
     technician. This ensures the RVR, based on the HIRL setting of 3, 4 or 5 is
     representative of existing RVR.
     5.7.2.7. Aid the WF in verifying conditions resource protection WWAs.
     5.7.2.8. Notify the WF of any observed Tornado or funnel cloud.
     5.7.2.9. Any other significant meteorological condition.

      5.7.3. 97 SFS personnel will relay any hazardous weather reports or sightings (tornado,
      funnel cloud, hail, freezing precipitation (rain freezing on impact and/or forms a glaze on the
      ground or other surfaces) etc.) to WF personnel. Unofficial reports of severe weather from
      credible sources within 15 miles will be appended in the remarks of the observation and
      disseminated longline and locally during augmentation of the AN/FMQ-19.
      5.7.4. Flying Squadron personnel will relay PIREPS to the WF either directly or through
      telephone, PMSV, ATC Tower, or RAPCON.
5.8. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). The term METWATCH is used to provide an
organized approach for weather personnel to maintain situational awareness of both current and
future meteorological situations with the primary focus on un-forecasted changes in the weather.
The 26 OWS will perform a continuous METWATCH for AAFB, with the WF providing “eyes
forward” support as defined by AFMAN 15-129V1 and 2. Changes in the status of weather
elements result in notifications disseminated from the WF or 26 OWS to base agencies.
      5.8.1. The METWATCH process encompasses WWA criteria (Tables 7.1-7.2) and SPECI
      observation criteria (Attachment 2).
      5.8.2. The WF will relay significant, time-sensitive meteorological information not found in
      coded meteorological reports to the 26 OWS to assist in characterization operations.
      5.8.3. The WF will alert the 26 OWS to developing situations not coded in meteorological
      reports that potentially drive amendments to forecast products from the 26 OWS or impact
      flight safety.

                               STAFF WEATHER SERVICES

6.1. General. The senior weather officer serves as the WF/CC and staff weather officer for the
97 AMW and its commanders. The WF/CC provides weather and space-environment expertise
to various committees, advisory groups, and the 97 AMW/CC’s Senior Staff to ensure
comprehensive consideration of natural environment effects on base operations. When needed,
WF/CC duties may be delegated to other qualified weather personnel. The WF/CC creates and
redefines staff weather services as needed to add maximum value to AAFB operations. Staff
weather services are normally provided Monday through Friday from 0730-1630L and will be
provided outside of these normal hours with prior coordination from 97 AMW leadership (i.e.
tropical weather support, short-notice humanitarian relief taskings, etc.). Sample staff weather
products described below are available on the WF SharePoint webpage by selecting the “Sample
Weather Products” link on the left-side of the webpage and in Attachment 9.
6.2. Staff Weather Brief. The WF provides the 97 AMW Commanders and Staff with the
current weather synopsis and planning forecast. The briefing format changes to effectively
describe weather impacts on the mission of the day and to incorporate technological
advancements.
6.3. Crisis Action Team (CAT) Staff Brief. During CAT activations, the WF/CC or
designated WF representative will provide detailed weather information as it impacts all facets
related to the activation. Slide presentations are prepared as time permits. In the event the
preparing of slides is not feasible, the WF/CC will verbally provide weather information.
6.4. Deployment/Concept Briefings. During mobility concept briefs and/or deployment briefs,
the WF/CC will provide mobilizing personnel with the current weather picture and planning
forecast for AAFB and deployment locations, as well as climatic data for deployment locations
upon request.
6.5. 5-Day Forecast. The WF will produce a daily 5-Day forecast for AAFB with the
predominant conditions expected for the next five days. Forecast weather parameters include
sky condition, precipitation type and high and low temperatures and potential limiting conditions
to the mission.
6.6. Tropical Weather Support. The WF will provide tropical updates using the most current
Tropical Threat Analysis Product (TC-TAP) produced by the 26 OWS derived from the
National Hurricane Center when projected landfall is forecast to impact any Air Force Base or a
Category 3 or higher hurricane has potential to impact a “major” city (i.e., New Orleans,
Houston, etc.). Wing leadership will be briefed at the Maintenance (Mx) briefing when needed
and no deviations from NHC/26 OWS will be made. Supported agencies should also understand
that 48-hour and 72-hour outlooks (or longer if issued) contain a high degree of uncertainty, are
for planning purposes only, and are subject to change.
6.7. Climatology Support. The WF leverages the support of the 14th Weather Squadron
Strategic Climatic Information Service for climate statistics all over the world. Units requiring
climate information should contact the WF/CC or Flight Chief for mission specific
climatological information.
 32                                                       ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013


6.8. Special Occasion Briefs. When requested, the WF has the capability to provide current
weather synopsis and/or planning forecast for air shows, change of command ceremonies, or
other official events.
6.9. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Weather Updates. The WF is responsible for
ensuring all AAFB weather information in the FLIP is accurate, to include Radar Instrument
Approach Minimums, local NOTAMs, and changes in airfield minima affecting SPECI/LOCAL
criteria, PMSV contact information, 26 OWS contact information, and airfield services hours.
All weather related updates will be requested through AMOPS. Information will be updated as
soon as a change is confirmed, and the FLIP information will be checked for accuracy as soon as
published.
6.10. Weather Training. The 97th Civil Engineer Squadron’s Readiness Flight provides
weather-safety training during the Newcomer’s in-briefing, the annual Severe Weather briefing,
and the annual Winter Safety briefing; however, the WF/CC or designated representative
provides the following training to base personnel whose jobs depend on proper weather
interpretation:
   6.10.1. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC). A 30-minute weather-safety brief provided
   upon request via the WF’s SharePoint page to pilots during the IRC. Describes aviation-
   weather hazards and explains how to avoid those hazards. Additionally, the briefing reviews
   local climatology and how to gain the most out of available military weather services.
   6.10.2. Local Weather Orientation. Provides the SOF, ATC Tower, and RAPCON
   personnel with the weather information they need to conduct their duties and participate in
   the AAFB Cooperative Weather Watch described in paragraph 5.7. The WF/CC or Flight
   Chief also offers this orientation to any other unit on base that needs a better understanding
   of weather to accomplish their mission. Personnel requiring local weather orientation should
   schedule an appointment with the Flight Chief at least 24 hours in advance.
6.11. Weather Plans.
   6.11.1. Local/base plans/annexes. The WF/CC (or designated representative) will attempt to
   document weather support in existing parent/host unit plans and directives (i.e., IEMP 10-2)
   and any other applicable plans containing an Annex H or weather appendix IAW AFI 15-
   128.
   6.11.2. 26 OWS-97 OSS/OSW Installation Data Page (IDP). WF leadership (WF/CC and
   Flight Chief) will review the IDP hosted on the 26 OWS webpage within 90 days of
   assignment or annually, whichever occurs first, to ensure consistency with supported unit
   requirements. WF leadership will inform the 26 OWS of any changes that occur at AAFB to
   update the IDP.

                                 RESOURCE PROTECTION

7.1. General. This section details actions undertaken by the WF and 26 OWS to provide
resource protection to AAFB through the use of weather watches, warnings, and advisories.
7.2. Delineation of Duties. The 26 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecast watches and
warnings for AAFB. The WF provides “eyes forward” for the 26 OWS and is responsible for
issuing all observed warnings and advisories. In the event of imminent threat to life and property
requiring an urgent dissemination, the WF will issue warnings normally issued by 26 OWS. In
these cases, the WF will inform 26 OWS as time permits.
   7.2.1. Expanded “Eyes Forward.” Expanded “eyes forward” support will be provided
   whenever Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP) is in place. “Eyes forward” support to the 26
   OWS will focus on the specific severe weather event which initiated SWAP.
   7.2.2. WF personnel will utilize the Cooperative Weather Watch to aid in augmentation of
   the AN/FMQ-19 and perform enhanced METWATCH procedures as applicable prior to and
   during the onset of severe weather.
7.3. Unit Requirements. Units are responsible for coordinating additional WWA support.
   7.3.1. Customers requesting support must validate the requirement by providing the WF with
   a list of protective actions taken each time the WWA is received.
   7.3.2. If the request falls within the operational capabilities of the WF and/or 26 OWS, then
   weather personnel will monitor and advise of such significant weather formations.
7.4. Weather Watches. Weather Watches provide special notice to AAFB units alerting them
to the potential for weather conditions to pose a hazard to life or property within 5 NM of the
base. A weather watch can be thought of as a “heads up” that base agencies and personnel need
to consider making plans to take appropriate protective actions should an actual weather warning
be issued at a later time. A complete list of AAFB Weather Watches and their desired lead-times
can be found in Table 7.1. Rules for issuing, amending, extending, and canceling weather
watches can be found in Table 7.3. See Attachment 5 for watch format.
7.5. Forecast Weather Warnings. A Weather Warning alerts units to an imminent or in-
progress weather event within 5 NM of the base that poses a hazard to life and/or property.
When warnings are issued, all personnel should take protective actions immediately. A complete
list of AAFB Weather Warnings and their desired lead-times can be found in Table 7.1. Rules
for issuing, amending, extending, and canceling weather warnings can be found in Table 7.3. See
Attachment 5 for example warning format.
7.6. Observed Weather Warning. An Observed Weather Warning will be issued for lightning.
An observed warning will only be issued when the condition occurs within 5 NM of the base.
Rules for issuing, amending, extending, and canceling observed weather warnings can be found
in Table 7.3. See Attachment 5 for sample warning format.

 The 26 OWS will not issue a watch or warning for sand storms or dust storms, or watches for
 strong winds or moderate thunderstorms.
 * AAFB leadership in cooperation and support of the operational risk management of units within
 the 97 AMW have elected to tailor the desired lead times of warnings in Table 7.1 (annotated with
 an asterisk) from the standard desired lead times prescribed in AFMAN 15-129V1, Table 4.1.
 † The WF will issue a severe thunderstorm watch and/or warning message via the cable audio
 override message for tornados, damaging winds > 65 mph, and/or hail > 1 1/2” in diameter. The
 97 AMW/CP will issue these same messages via the weather alert radios IAW local procedures.
 ± The WF will initiate then Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP) whenever a watch or warning is
 issued for these criteria (see paragraph 7.13 for additional information on SWAP).
7.7. Tornadic Activity. A localized and violently destructive windstorm occurring over land
characterized by a funnel-shaped cloud extending toward the ground. Tornadic activity is a
blanket term that includes tornadoes, funnel clouds, and/or waterspouts.
   7.7.1. Tornado Warning. A tornado warning will be issued by the 26 OWS and/or the WF
   when a tornado has been detected by WSR-88D Radar or visually observed and is anticipated
   to impact AAFB within 15 minutes. (Conditions for issuance of this warning are derived
   based on tornado characteristics, location observed, and speed of movement. Based upon the
   case-by-case characteristics of these factors, earlier warning may be provided).
   7.7.2. Tornado Warning Dissemination. When the criteria meets the conditions for issuance
   of a tornado warning, dissemination will occur via ATHOC and AAFB Alert Radios through
   the 97 AMW/CP and the Base Cable Audio Override system through the WF.
   7.7.3. Base Siren Activation (**). The Base Siren system will be sounded by the CP when
   the threat of an existing tornado or disastrous wind event is determined to be an imminent
   threat to impact AAFB within 5 minutes.
ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013                                                                  35


7.8. Lightning within 5 NM. The 26 OWS will issue a lightning watch when thunderstorm
potential exists within 5NM of AAFB within the next 30 minutes. The WF will issue a observed
lightning warning when conditions are observed within 5NM of AAFB.
7.9. Blizzard. A Blizzard is defined as: Duration of > 3 hours, sustained winds or gusts > 30
knots, considerable falling and/or blowing snow, with surface visibility < 1/4 mile/0400 meters
(all criteria must be met).
7.10. Observed Weather Advisories. Observed Weather Advisories provide special notice to
AAFB units notifying them that non-severe weather conditions, which could affect operations,
are occurring within 5NM of the base. An observed weather advisory is issued on the first
occurrence of the designated criteria. Rules for issuing, amending, extending, and canceling
weather advisories can be found in Table 7.3. A complete list of AAFB Observed Weather
Advisories can be found in Table 7.2. Example advisory format is found in Attachment 5.

 1      A Watch is not a substitute for a Warning. Units will issue Warnings, as required,
        regardless of whether or not a Watch had previously been issued.
 2      All Watches and Warnings are issued for specific and distinct locations.
        - The area affected by a Watch or Warning will be clearly indicated in the text of the
        Watch/Warning. Warnings will be issued for a 5NM radius of AAFB.
 3      The lightning watch and the observed lightning warning are separate entities and do not
        supersede previously issued Watches or WWs for other criteria
 4      A separate valid time will be specified for each criterion when warranted.
        - All times used in a Watch or Warning will be expressed in Coordinated Universal Time
        (UTC) and Local Time.
        - Exception: A valid time is not used in observed warnings or advisories. In place of valid

          not be issued. This will be accounted for as a miss.
6         The 26 OWS will issue observed warnings when the WF is not on duty or if the WF is
          unable to issue, as capability exists. Observed advisories that affect airfield operations
          (annotated with an asterisk in Table 7.2) will be issued by the 26 OWS when the WF is not
          on duty or if the WF is unable to issue, as capability exists.
7         More than one advisory may be in effect at the same time for the same location, but only
          one will be in effect for a particular phenomenon at the same time.
8         Under rare circumstances the WF may, without prior coordination, issue Warnings to
          facilitate resource protection actions when sufficient time does not exist to communicate a
          change in weather with the 26 OWS. The WF will forward pertinent information to the 26
          OWS to ensure the warning is entered into JET.
9         The WF will issue observed WWAs to include lightning warnings while on duty.
Rule      Rules for Amending, Extending, and Canceling WWAs
#
1         When a Warning or advisory no longer adequately describes the phenomenon’s expected
          occurrence, a completely new warning or advisory with a new number will be issued.
2         WWAs may be extended provided the extension is issued prior to the expiration of the
          original notice.
3         How the amended or extended WWA affects any previously issued notice will be stated.
4         WWAs issued for previously forecast/observed conditions which are no longer occurring
          and are not expected to recur, will be canceled.
5         Lightning Watches are canceled only when the potential for lightning within the next 30
          minutes is no longer forecast. Lightning Watches will not be canceled if there is potential
          for another thunderstorm within 30 minutes.
6         Observed Lightning Warnings will be canceled when thunderstorms have dissipated or
          passed beyond 5 NM of AAFB and lightning is no longer occurring within 5NM of AAFB.
          For lightning warning cancellations, a statement indicating its effect on any previously
          issued warnings, such as “WEATHER WARNING #XX-XXX remains in effect” or
          “WEATHER WATCH #XX-XXX FOR LIGHTNING REMAINS IN EFFECT.” will be
          included.
          Note: The WF (or 26 OWS when the WF is off duty) will cancel the lightning warning.
7.11. Special Weather Message Statements.
    7.11.1. ICEMAN. A phone message will be transferred to the SOF and OSS/DO when
    airframe frost is expected to occur. The WF technician will contact the SOF on duty in the
    ATC tower and the OSS/DO via phone NLT 1500 the day prior to expected frost. The SOF
    and OSS/DO will use the forecast to determine whether deicing equipment is needed to be
    in-place and costly takeoffs can be avoided.
      7.11.2. SNOWMAN. A phone message will be transferred to the OSS/DO whenever snow
      accumulation greater than 1/2” is expected to occur at AAFB. This may be done shortly after
      the weather watch or warning for heavy snow is issued by the 26 OWS. The WF technician
      will contact the OSS/DO via phone NLT 1500 the day prior to the expected occurrence of
      1/2” or more of snowfall. The OSS/DO will use the forecast to determine whether de-icing
      equipment is needed to be in-place and costly takeoffs can be avoided.
ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013                                                                   37


   7.11.3. 26 OWS Special Weather Statements (SWS). The 26 OWS will issue SWS products
   to notify military decision makers of widespread severe weather events affecting military
   installations serviced by the OWS. SWSs will be routinely updated as conditions warrant. A
   SWS is a stand-alone product normally issued 48-72 hours in advance of the forecast event.
   SWS will be an alphanumeric product describing the type, onset, duration, and area impacted
   by the event and will be disseminated via common user communications. SWS may also
   include graphical depiction of the forecast event. The 26 OWS disseminates SWSs to WF
   personnel for evaluation and possible further dissemination/integration into the 97 AMW’s
   risk management decision cycle.
7.12. Dissemination. Dissemination of WWAs, extensions, and cancellations are done via the
Integrated Weather Warnings Capability (IWWC) in JET. In the event a WWA does not reach
the intended agency, the WF and/or 26 OWS is responsible for notifying agencies listed in
Table 7.4 as identified in the supported agency data page. See Attachment 5 for more
information on dissemination.

7.13. Severe Weather Action Plan (SWAP). IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, the WF has
established procedures ensuring sufficient personnel are available to respond and address
necessary preventive, protective actions required during potential/actual severe weather events or
during meteorological/operational events to safeguard resources 24-hours a day, 7 days-a-week.
The purpose of SWAP is to provide a means for the WF to systematically and collectively
manage the additional strain and decision making processes that accompany severe weather.
SWAP is a cooperative effort between the 26 OWS and the WF in which each agency has
specific roles and responsibilities as defined by AFMAN 15-129V1 and 2.
7.14. Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT). SWAT encompasses a primary and alternate
technician as the “Stand-by” person subject to recall during WF downtime. Table 7.1 identifies
events subject to recall with a ± symbol.
   7.14.1. “Stand-by” Technician. This individual serves as the designated SWAT leader until
   the WF/CC or Flight Chief is recalled. During WF downtime, the 97 AMW/CP informs the
   WF each time the 26 OWS issues, extends or cancels a severe weather watch or warning
   listed in Table 7.1 (appended with a ± symbol). The stand-by weather technician returns to
   the weather station to initiate a local METWATCH during the valid period of each watch or
   warning.
   7.14.2. Recall Procedures. When recalled, the stand-by weather technician makes contact
   with 26 OWS and 97 AMW/CP immediately upon opening the weather station.
 38                                                          ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013


         7.14.2.1. The stand-by weather technician notifies and/or recalls the WF/CC and/or
         Flight Chief for assistance with the METWATCH when a watch or warning is issued as
         listed in Table 7.1 (appended with a ±).
         7.14.2.2. Notification will not occur earlier than 4-hours prior to the forecast impact of
         the severe weather event.
         7.14.2.3. If the stand-by weather technician cannot be reached by the 97 AMW/CP, the
         CP will contact the WF/CC, Flight Chief, or Element NCOICs IAW Local Policy.
   7.14.3. At a minimum, the WF and 26 OWS will conduct and document an annual exercise
   of coordinated SWAP. An actual severe weather event meets the intent of an exercise.
   7.14.4. During hours of airfield closure, the 26 OWS will pass all WWAs to the 97
   AMW/CP, who will then pass any severe watches or warnings to the stand-by weather
   technician or the WF/CC or WF Flight Chief if the stand-by weather technician not available.
   The stand-by weather technician will assess the situation and determine the need to activate
   the SWAP.
7.15. Operational Reports (OPREP). IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, AFI 10-206, Operational
Reporting, (including the AETCSUP), and AFI 10-229, when the 97 AMW/CP initiates the
process of reporting the impact of significant weather to higher headquarters, the WF will
provide the following to the 97 AMW/CP, 97 OSS/CC, 26 OWS/CC, 26 OWS/DO, 26 OWS

   communication and meteorological equipment that is maintained by contract.
   8.15.2. Ensure scheduled maintenance does not degrade the MISSIONWATCH performed
   by the WF during periods of inclement weather and notify the WF technician prior to routine
   maintenance. NOTE: When Airfield Systems Flight technicians perform periodic
   maintenance of the AN/FMQ-19 precipitation gauge, they are required to inject water into
   the tipping bucket. Because the sensor is an analog sensor, and even though it is disabled,
   the sensor memory remembers the injected amount of water and reports it when the sensor is
   re-enabled. The algorithms process this data and then report it into the daily and monthly
   summary messages. The weather technician must ask how much water was injected,
   annotate the amount, and later backup (edit) appropriately and remove the amount from the
   daily precipitation readings. Even though the issue of analog sensor and reporting may be
   corrected in the future, if sensors are not carefully managed during maintenance, errors can
   occur. Airfield Systems Flight technicians must ensure WF is notified promptly that the
   precipitation gauge is undergoing maintenance.
   8.15.3. Maintain and update all Technical Orders and will advise operators of any significant
   changes, as received.
8.16. 97 CS/SCOSC. 97 CS/SCOSC (Communications Focal Point) will:
   8.16.1. Upon notification by WF personnel, react to meteorological equipment
   outages/problems, record outage reports, issue job control numbers, contact appropriate
   maintenance personnel and monitor maintenance actions. WF personnel will provide
   mission impact statements when equipment outages degrade mission-support capability. The
   WF Airfield Services Element NCOIC (or representative) determines the operational impact
   of outages and consults with communications personnel. WF personnel will contact
   Communications Focal Point at DSN 866-7000 for assistance.
   8.16.2. Provide 24-hour internet access.
   8.16.3. Ensure dissemination procedures are in place so meteorological products originating
   from 26 OWS and/or the WF are routed through the JET server. Network access and

Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA)—A strategic weather center at Offutt AFB NE, providing
atmospheric data and analysis/forecast products required by the regional OWSs and the WFs
worldwide. AFWA provides the centralized repository for global observations and forecasts that
are data based at AFWA and, in turn, disseminated to DOD weather data users worldwide. In
addition to global observations and forecasts collected from worldwide sources, AFWA collects
meteorological satellite data from multiple sources. Based on global analysis of available data,
AFWA creates global analysis and forecast products to meet the forecast requirements of its
supported users.
Alternate Operating Location—The location to which the WF will move in the event that Bldg
185 is evacuated.
Basic Weather Watch—A method of observing, recording, and disseminating significant
changes in weather conditions to essential customers.
Cooperative Weather Watch—A method of collective observing shared by the weather
observer, tower personnel, and SOF, to enhance the mission of BWW. The weather observer
collates information from other sources and disseminates as needed.
Desired Lead Time (DLT)—The total amount of time required to disseminate a forecast WWA
from the 26 OWS through the local dissemination tree to all affected end-users plus the amount
 50                                                        ALTUSAFBI15-101 14 JUNE 2013


of advance notice a supported organization requires to complete mandatory protective actions
before the onset of a particular weather phenomenon.
Flight Information Publication—Booklet containing aircraft approach, landing, and takeoff
guidance at various airfields, to include AAFB. Also lists weather restrictions on airfields.
Installation Data Page—A document defining the specific environmental support requirements,
technical data, reference material, and contact information for each organization receiving TAF
and WWA support from the 26 OWS.
Instrument Refresher Course—Continuation training for aircrews. The WF provides
instructors and material for the weather segment of the course upon request.
Issue Time—The time when an agency is notified of a WWA. When more than one agency is
notified, the issue time is the time the last agency is notified. Follow-up notifications are not
considered when determining issue time.
METAR—A regular observation, taken and disseminated locally and longline.
Meteorological Watch— A deliberate process for monitoring the terrestrial weather or space
environment in an area or region. The purpose of a METWATCH is to identify when and where
observed conditions significantly diverge from forecast conditions and determine courses of
action to update or amend a forecast product or group of products and notify designated
agencies.
Mission Execution Forecast—A mission execution forecast is how flight weather information
is passed to the flying customer. It can take the form of a verbal briefing, a 175-1 briefing, a
weather flimsy, or other forms.
Mission Weather Product—Any weather product or group of weather products generated by
the WF that is integrated into the military decision making process. MWPs may be planning or
execution products and are not limited to aviation missions.
MISSIONWATCH—A deliberate process of monitoring terrestrial weather or the space
environment for specific mission-limiting environmental factors that may adversely impact
missions in execution. The MISSIONWATCH process is performed by the WF and is intended
to identify previously unidentified environmental threats and alert decision-makers at the
operational unit and/or airborne mission commanders, enabling dynamic changes to mission
profiles that may mitigate the environmental threat and optimize the chance of mission success.
Operational Weather Squadron—A regional forecast and weather watch center. Commonly
referred to as a “hub,” AAFB’s servicing OWS is the 26 OWS located at Barksdale AFB,
Louisiana.
Severe Thunderstorm—A thunderstorm presenting a threat to lives or property that requires
agencies to enhance resource protection measures. Generally, thunderstorms producing hail
greater than or equal to 3/4 inch diameter and/or surface wind greater than or equal to 50 knots.
Terminal Aerodrome Forecast—A coded weather bulletin providing forecast information for
an aerodrome complex to facilitate flight planning and command and control. TAFs are
formatted IAW AFMAN 15-124, Meteorological Codes, and amended IAW AFMAN 15-129V1,
Air and Space Weather Operations-Characterization.

Figure A3.1. Example Observation Decoding.




A3.2. Observation Formats.
   A3.2.1. METAR/SPECI Format
      A3.2.1.1. (1) Type of Observation. Either an Aviation Routine Weather Report
      (METAR) or Special Observation (SPECI).
      A3.2.1.2. (2) Station Identifier.     KLTS is the long-line header for Altus AFB
      observations.
      A3.2.1.3. (3) Date/Time Group. The date/time group (UTC) that the last element of the
      observation was observed.
      A3.2.1.4. (4) Mode of observation. This will either state AUTO or will be blank.
      AUTO in this example indicates the observation was calculated and disseminated by the
      AN/FMQ-19 without any augmentation by the weather technician.
      A3.2.1.5. (5) Wind. This portion of the observation provides the wind direction (first
      three numbers, VRB for variable, or 000 for Calm), sustained wind speed (next 2 or 3
      numbers), and winds gusts (any numbers following the ‘G’) if there have been any
      measured in knots.
      A3.2.1.6. (6) Visibility. Recorded in statute miles or fraction of a statute mile. Any

A3.3. PIREP Format. A PIREP is a report of meteorological phenomena encountered by an
aircraft in flight. All PIREPs received by the WF that do not meet the standard dissemination
criteria outlined in paragraph A3.3.1 but are significant to flying operations and flight safety will
be verbally passed along to aircrews, ATC agencies/SOF (if received from another credible
source since JET doesn’t allow the local dissemination of PIREPS. All PIREPS meeting
standard dissemination criteria will be transmitted longline via JET. Back-up options include
using the AFW-WEBS Alphanumeric upload option.
   A3.3.1. At a minimum, a PIREP must contain the transmitting organization, a message type,
   location, time, flight level, type of aircraft, and at least one other element.

A4.3. TAF Specification and Amendment Criteria. The 30-hour forecast specifies the time
of occurrence (to the nearest hour), the duration, and the intensity (where applicable) of the
weather elements listed below. The weather elements listed in Table A4.1 must be considered
when issuing the TAF for AAFB and if expected to occur will be included in the forecast. If at
any time the conditions listed in this section occur but are not correctly forecast or are forecast to
occur and do not occur by the specified predominant change group ending time, the TAF must be
amended.

A4.4. TAF Amendment Actions. 26 OWS is primarily responsible for TAF amendment. In
the event that 26 OWS is unable to amend, the WF will amend the TAF during duty hours.
A4.5. Remarks. The 26 OWS utilizes the following remarks accordingly.                 NOTE:
YYGG/YYGG = Date/Time Group.
   A4.5.1. Limited METWATCH. The 26 OWS will append the last line of the TAF with the
   words “LIMITED METWATCH YYGG TIL YYGG” when the airfield is open and no
   weather personnel are on duty and an operational automated sensor is not in use.
   A4.5.2. Last No Amendments. The 26 OWS will append the last line of the TAF with the
   words “LAST NO AMDS AFT YYGG NEXT YYGG” when the airfield is closed and a
   TAF is not required.

                       WATCH/WARNING/ADVISORY FORMAT

A5.1. General. This attachment explains format and notification procedures for AAFB WWAs.

Figure A5.1. Weather Watch Example.




Figure A5.2. Weather Warning Example.




Figure A5.3. Weather Advisory Example.




A5.2. Basic Format Elements. The following criterion identifies the basic elements required in
generating a WWA and identifies the validity of the alarm.
   A5.2.1. AAFB header and WWA number. Format numbering sequence is identified with
   the two-digit month, followed by the consecutive number of WWAs generated during that
   month. For example, “Weather Watch 04-025 for Altus AFB (KLTS)” would indicate that
   this is the 25th weather watch generated in the month of April.
   A5.2.2. WWA valid times. The start and end times of WWAs are indicated in UTC (CST or
   CDT) to UTC (CST or CDT). For example, “Valid 18/1900Z (18/1300L) to 19/0100Z
   (18/1900L)” indicates the time period of validity assuming the +6 hr conversion to UTC.
   A5.2.3. Text of the WWA. Provides detailed explanation to the watch, warning or advisory
   and any additional remarks required (i.e. maximum value expected). For example, “Potential
   for Lightning exists within 5 nm at Altus AFB” indicates that a lightning watch is in effect
   for AAFB; lighting is expected to occur within 5NM.
A5.3. Dissemination. AAFB employs a pyramid notification network process to promptly
disseminate, extend or cancel weather watches, warnings and advisories. Figure A5.4, shown
below, identifies the agencies immediately notified. Agencies may monitor the status of
watches,     warnings     and   advisories    via   the    WF      SharePoint   page     at
https://97amw.portal.altus.af.mil/sites/OG/oss/weather/default.aspx by clicking on the
“Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories” link at the top of the webpage or by directly
accessing             the             26           OWS               webpage             at

Figure A5.4. Weather Watch/Warning/Advisory Notification Pyramid.




   A5.3.1. The 26 OWS and/or WF Role. The 26 OWS and/or WF initiates the notification
   process by disseminating, extending or canceling WWAs via JET.
   A5.3.2. 97 AMW/CP Role. The CP assumes responsibility for further dissemination via a
   variety of different methods dependent on the specific weather watch, warning, and/or
   advisory. The CP will initiate local checklists based upon the watch, warning or advisory
   issued. Figure A5.5 identifies the agencies listed on CP checklists that receive watch,
   warning, and/or advisory notifications.

advisories.




   A5.3.3. AAFB Agency Responsibilities. Individual organizations will follow internal
   notification procedures to inform subordinate units.
A5.4. Outages. In the event JET or its communication channels are disrupted, the WF and/or
26 OWS will utilize e-mail, fax, or phone calls to disseminate the information of watches,
warnings and advisories to agencies listed in Figure A5.4.

A10.1. Planning Weather. Planning weather is available on the WF SharePoint page. The data
is produced during the weather technician’s swing shift for the next flying day. When the airfield
is closed on weekends and holidays, planning weather for the next flying day is compiled on the
WF swing shift prior to airfield closing and will be posted prior to the airfield reopening. Figures
A10.1-A10.6 provide the planning weather sample, format, and decoding.
