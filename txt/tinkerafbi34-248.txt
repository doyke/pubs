                            DV GREETER PROGRAM OUTLINE

A2.1. Distinguished Visitor (DV) Greeters meet arriving and departing DVs at AM Ops. Tinker
serves as a main hub for many DVs traveling across country. DVs stopping here have always
looked forward to their stopovers to Tinker because of the outstanding hospitality shown to
them. DV Greeters represent Tinker Air Force Base and the Installation Commander. To many
DVs, this will be their first impression of Tinker therefore is it up to the DV Greeter to ensure the
first impression is positive.
A2.2. Newly assigned DV Greeters will be provided a list of important contact/reference phone
numbers. All must schedule training through the 72 ABW Protocol Office (72 ABW/CCP) and
an AM Ops orientation prior to their first DV Greeter duty. 72 ABW/CCP can be reached at
739-3330. AM Operations can be reached at 734-2191.
A2.3. The monthly DV Greeter schedule will be distributed by 72 ABW/CCP normally by the
25th day of the month prior to duty. All changes to the DV Greeter schedule will be coordinated
via email to 72 ABW/CCP, or if a change occurs on a weekend by contacting the Tinker AFB
Command Post, at 734-7313.
A2.4. Duty day for the DV Greeter begins on the assigned calendar day at 0800 and continues
through 0800 the following day. Uniform will be uniform of the day/duty uniform unless
otherwise specified for a particular visitor by OC-ALC Command Offices.
A2.5. AM Ops will email a Daily DV Schedule for the following day at approximately 1600L to
the Tinker DV Greeter Notification Distribution Group (MS Outlook Mail Group maintained by
72 ABW/CCP) to notify DV Greeters and other interested parties of upcoming scheduled DV
arrivals/departures. A combination of codes from the Branch of Service Codes table and the
VIP/DV Code table below will be used.

A2.6. The Tinker Command Post will make telephone notifications of scheduled
arrivals/departures and schedule changes to the DV Greeter and appropriate command sections
as soon as practical. The Tinker Command Post will advise the DV Greeter of the visitor’s ETA
and inform him/her if released for the respective DV.
A2.7. The DV Greeter will report to AM Ops, Bldg 240, no later than 30 minutes prior to the
scheduled arrival/departure of the DV. The following duties must be performed by the DV
Greeter or Protocol in the Tinker DV Lounge prior to the DV’s arrival/departure:
       Turn all lights on (including restrooms).

       Turn TV on (sound at a level just below conversation) and tuned to channel 200 (CNN).

       Make sure the room, the counter and surrounding area are clean. If there are outdated
       Tinker Takeoffs on the coffee table, ensure they are discarded and replaced with 2-3 current
       editions.

       Make coffee. Check icemaker, if there is no ice available in the icemaker, use the ice
       machine in the break room near the parking lot.

NOTE: The Tinker DV Lounge is for use by DVs and their guests only. If Space “A” personnel
and crewmembers request drinks or snacks, direct them to the vending machines in the break
room and/or the flight planning room.
A2.8. When the DV plane arrives, once on the ground, the DV greeter will go the “Red Carpet”
area outside AM Ops to greet. The Red Carpet area is a “No Hat Area” so do not wear one.
When the plane has taxied and is about to come to the parking area, the DV greeter(s) will render
honors to the aircraft as below:
       As the aircraft turns into the parking space, snap to attention. If you are military and
greeting a general officer, salute the aircraft after it completes its turn into the parking space and
hold the salute until the aircraft stops.

       If you are greeting an SES, only stand at attention.

NOTE: When civilians greet the aircraft, regardless if the DV is a general or an SES, they come
to attention after the aircraft completes its turn into the parking space and remain so until the
aircraft stops.
A2.9. When a DV is departing, notify the DV when the aircraft is ready for boarding and offer
to carry their bags to the aircraft. Position yourself a safe distance away from the aircraft; at
least 30 feet. If you are on the red carpet position, stand at the bottom of the "T". When the
"chalks" are pulled, the aircraft will begin to roll forward and that is when you "snap" to
attention.
       If the aircraft is carrying a general officer, salute the aircraft.

       If it is carrying a Senior Executive Service (SES) member, remain at attention.
A2.10. If a DV requests the use of the STU III phone, the key must be signed out from AM Ops
and the DV Greeter must ensure that personnel have a SECRET security clearance before the
STU III can be used. Ensure the DV has privacy to conduct his/her phone call and that the STU
III key is secure until such time it has been returned to AM Ops personnel.
A2.11. If the DV requests a meal or snack, the Exchange Food Court is open until 1900 and
Burger King is open until 2000 hours (drive through is open until 2100) except Sundays (1800
for both dine-in and drive-through). If a box lunch is preferred, AM Ops normally has menus for
box lunches provided by the Flight Kitchen. The Bowling Center is another quick stop for any
type fast food, contact them for summer/winter hours of operation. If transportation is required,
call base transportation at 734-2803.
A2.12. If the DV requests that you leave or insists that you do not need to stay, use your
judgment on whether to stay or leave. Keep in mind, once you leave, if there are no other unit
representatives or protocol staff members available and if the plane has problems, no one will be
available to provide assistance to the DV if he/she is delayed or cannot depart.
A2.13. Once the DV’s aircraft has successfully departed, the DV greeter must ensure the DV
Lounge is straightened up and the room is made ready for the next DV to arrive/depart.
TINKERAFBI34-248 25 AUGUST 2011                                                                 9


A2.14. Unless accompanied by another DV, the OC-ALC Commander or Director, Executive
Director, and Vice Commander prefer not to be met by the DV Greeter when they are traveling.
A2.15. DVs from another Major Command or military branch may be met by a representative or
representatives from another Tinker organization. Therefore, if a counterpart or associate meets
the visiting DV, there may be no requirement for the scheduled DV Greeter to participate. The
same applies if a protocol party meets the DV. The DV Greeter must confirm with the respective
counterpart, associate, or Tinker Command Post that the DV arrival/departure is appropriately
covered by another representative. There is no need for duplicate greeters.
A2.16. The OC-ALC Protocol office (OC-ALC/CCP) will assist in greeting Lieutenant
Generals, equivalents, and above, or other DVs as directed by the OC-ALC command section. If
enough notice is provided, OC-ALC/CCP will contact the visiting DV’s office and offer/provide
assistance in ordering/picking up any meals, specific drinks, or specific snacks the DV’s request.
