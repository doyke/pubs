1. Background.
     1.1. Kadena Air Base and other installations operated by the 18 WG on Okinawa, Japan,
     reside on property owned, occupied, and farmed by individual landowners prior to the
     establishment of military installations by American military forces during World War II. As
     mission requirements allow and when requested by municipal offices for land parcels located
     within its municipal boundaries, access has historically been granted by the 18 WG to tenants
     for the purpose of crop farming. For the purposes of this instruction, a tenant farmer is
     defined as a farmer sponsored by the applicable municipality and approved by the 18 WG
     who engages in or desires to engage in crop farming within installations on Okinawa that are
     administered by the 18 WG.
     1.2. There are various security, fire, environmental, and safety concerns associated with
     granting tenant farmers access to 18 WG installations. Lack of past oversight of the tenant
     farming operations has led to issues such as fires, illegal dumping, construction of
     unauthorized structures, and expansion of farming plots. The purpose of this instruction is to
     resolve past issues associated with tenant farming by clearly defining the roles and
     responsibilities of a tenant farmer and 18 WG organizations involved in the oversight of
     tenant farming.
2. Tenant Farmer Access Approval Process.
     2.1. The process for approving tenant farmer access to 18 WG installations is depicted
     graphically on Attachment 2 of this instruction and detailed in the following paragraphs.
     2.2. Individuals farming property under the control of the 18 WG who have not previously
     registered as a Tenant Farmer may request approval as a Tenant Farmer. The farmer must
KADENAABI32-9003 3 DECEMBER 2014                                                               3


  submit a map of the land parcel currently being farmed and their name, address and phone
  number. The information must be delivered to Kadena’s Pass and Identification Center
  located at Kadena Gate 1 and routed to the 718th Civil Engineer Squadron, Installation
  Management Flight (718 CES/CEI).
     2.2.1. The information will be reviewed by 718 CES/CEI. 718 CES/CEI will inform the
     farmer if this initial request is tentatively approved or disapproved.
     2.2.2. If tentatively approved, the farmer can proceed with the approval steps in
     paragraphs 2.3 through 2.8
     2.2.3. If disapproved, the farmer must discontinue activities on the land parcel or will be
     considered to be trespassing on an 18 WG installation.
  2.3. The tenant farmer must provide the municipality within which the land parcel lies with
  the following items in order to request access to property under the control of the 18 WG.
     2.3.1. A signed tenant farming access agreement (see Attachment 3).
     2.3.2. A completed Fifth Air Force (5 AF) Form 98EJ, Standard Pass, Request Packet
     (see Attachments 4 and 5).
     2.3.3. The tenant farmer’s vehicle identification information.
     2.3.4. The tenant farmer must submit a map of the property showing the boundaries of
     the parcel being farmed.
  2.4. The municipality must route in information specified in paragraph 2.3 to 718 CES/CEI.
  2.5. Requests for base access that are not coordinated through the local municipality will be
  denied.
  2.6. Approved tenant farmers may request temporary access for helpers for specific actions,
  such as harvest season. Requests shall be submitted on an Unescorted Entry Authorization
  List (UEAL) Request (see Attachment 6). The municipality must route the required
  information to 718 CES/CEI.
  2.7. Renewals of farmer base passes or unescorted entry authorization listings must be
  requested within 30 days of expiration to avoid gaps in base access. Renewals are
  accomplished in accordance with the steps specified in paragraphs 2.3. through 2.6.
  2.8. Upon receipt of a base access submittal from the local municipality, the 18 WG will
  review the access request sequentially among the following three units: (1) 718 CES/CEI;
  (2) 18th Munitions Squadron, Systems Flight (18 MUNS/MXWKC) (if the request is within
  the munitions storage area); and (3) 18th Security Forces Squadron, Pass and Registration
  (18 SFS/S5B).
     2.8.1. 718 CES/CEI will ensure that current and planned land use at the site is
     compatible with farming, that current operations at the farming parcel are in accordance
     with real estate and environmental quality requirements, and update the 18 WG’s
     geographic information system to ensure tracking of parcel boundaries. 718 CES/CEI
     will maintain the signed access agreements and all documentation of parcel boundaries
     provided by local municipality.

        2.8.2. 18 MUNS will ensure requested farming does not interfere with munitions
        operations and maintain accurate EALs.
        2.8.3. 18 SFS/S5B will verify that the individual requesting access is not prohibited from
        entering 18 WG installations, enter the individual into Defense Biometric Identification
        System (DBIDS), and approve an access pass for a period of no more than one (1) year.
        18 SFS must receive an approved 5 AF Form 98EJ request packet from the applicable
        municipality to issue access passes.
     2.9. If at any point in the review process an organization denies the access request, they will
     inform 718 CES/CEI and other units that have previously approved the request of why the
     request is being denied. For disapproval, the 718 CES/CEI will provide advanced notice to
     the 18th Mission Support Group Commander (18 MSG/CC) and the 18th Wing Public
     Affairs Office (18 WG/PA) and then notify the appropriate local municipality. Otherwise,
     upon being informed of approval, 718 CES/CEI will notify the local municipality that the
     request has been approved and a base pass will be issued at the Gate 1 Pass and Registration
     Office.
     2.10. If a tenant farmer is found to be in violation of the requirements of this agreement,
     718 CES/CEI will provide written notification detailing the items that must be corrected.
     The farmer will be granted ten (10) days from written notification to correct the deficiencies.
     Under certain circumstances and on a case-by-case basis, 18 MSG/CC may grant the tenant
     farmer more than ten (10) days to correct the deficiencies. If a violation is not corrected
     within the 10-day period, the farmer will be notified that all items must be removed from the
     property within 5 days. At the end of that 5-day period, the farmer’s pass will be revoked
     and the individual will lose Tenant Farmer status. The individual must discontinue use of the
     land parcel or be considered to be trespassing on an 18 WG installation. Nothing in this
     paragraph limits 18 WG personnel from immediately revoking a tenant farmer’s access if
     security or safety warrants such revocation.
3. Tenant Farmer Requirements
     3.1. The requirements that all tenant farmers must comply with in order to maintain access to
     18 WG installations are detailed within this section. Additionally, these requirements are

     access to 18 WG installations. The procedures for submitting Attachment 3 are detailed in
     Section 2. Periodic inspections of tenant farming operations by security forces, real property,
     fire, safety and environmental personnel may occur. Failure to comply with the provisions of
