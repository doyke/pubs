                                           Chapter 1

            AIR AND SPACE EXPEDITIONARY FORCE (AEF) CONCEPTS

1.1. General. The AEF is the Air Force‘s methodology for organizing, training, equipping, and
sustaining rapidly responsive air and space forces to meet defense strategy requirements.
Through the AEF, the Air Force supports defense strategy requirements using a combination of
both permanently assigned and rotational (allocated) forces.
   1.1.1. How to use this AFI. This AFI governs Unit Type Code (UTC) status reporting. This
   instruction should be followed in the context of AFI 10-401 Air Force Operations Planning
   and Execution, which contains planning considerations for these UTCs and a full description
   of AEF concepts. Chapter 1 contains the basic description of the AEF and AEF UTC
   Reporting Tool (ART). Chapter 2 outlines roles and responsibilities in UTC reporting.
   Chapter 3 describes assessment and reporting policies.
1.2. Force Presentation. The Air Force aligns its war fighting capabilities into a baseline of 10
AEFs, each intended to contain an equivalent capability from which to provide forces. During
periods of increased requirements, capability areas from these 10 AEFs may be realigned within
the Global AEF construct to a Tempo Band that provides a deeper pool of capability, deploying
that capability at a more stringent deploy-to-dwell rate. The Air Force develops and tailors force
packages to meet mission requirements. Specifically tailored forces are presented to theater
commanders as Air and Space Expeditionary Task Forces (AETFs). Refer to Air Force Doctrine
Document (AFDD) 2 for doctrinal guidance on force presentation. The AEF will include
strategic ―enabler‖ or common user assets, such as long-range mobility, Special Operations
Forces (SOF), and space forces, that will provide support to authorized organizations within and
outside of the Department of Defense (DOD), including Air Force movements of AEF forces.
Also postured as enablers, the Air Force‘s High Demand/Low Supply (HD/LS) assets (U2, E-8
JSTARS, E-3 AWACS, RC-135 RIVET JOINT, SOF, CSAR, etc.), will play critical roles in
AEF operations.
1.3. Spectrum of Operations. The National Military Strategy dictates that the Air Force be
prepared to support requirements across the spectrum of operations from humanitarian and
disaster relief operations up to and including major war (MW). The Air Force will meet its day-
to-day steady-state deployed operational commitments using the UTCs assigned to the two on-
call AEFs, one on-call AEW, and available enabler forces. Any substantial or sustained
commitment of forces beyond this level will constitute a surge for the Air Force, which will
require some degree of reconstitution of the involved forces after the surge ends.
1.4. Force Management. The AEF libraries contain a finite amount of capability that at any
given time identifies forces that constitute the total force that has been made available or
allocated for scheduling. The 10 AEFs are paired (e.g. AEF 1 and 2, AEF 3 and 4, etc.) into five
4-month contingency on-call/deployment eligibility period every 20 months. Most LS/HD assets,
as defined in GMFP, are not formally assigned to individual AEFs but are postured in the
Enabler library and will rotate as operational requirements dictate. Deployment levels must be
consistent with GMFP guidelines. Air refueling forces and medium-range airlift forces (currently
consisting of C-130 units) will be assigned to AEFs and enabler operations, subject to careful
scheduling to avoid over tasking.

1.5. Reporting AEF Status - General. To view the health of forces in the ten (10) designated
AEF's, AEWs, lead mobility wings and enablers, Air Force senior leadership determined a need
to collect UTC readiness status data from all AEF-allocated UTCs of sufficient detail to support
the following goals:
     1.5.1. Provide HQ USAF, AF Component Commanders, MAJCOM's, and AFPC/DPW
     readiness information to employ, manage, and sustain AEF operations.
     1.5.2. Provide units a mechanism to report a UTC‘s current and future (6 months out) ability
     or inability to fulfill its Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) across the full ROMO, to
     include contingency and rotational operations, and highlight associated deficiencies within
     the UTC.
     1.5.3. Provide information to aid resource allocation and tasking decisions during steady
     state and crisis actions.
1.6. System Description: The AEF UTC Status Reporting Tool (ART) is designed to support
the goals listed above. ART allows AEF-allocated units the ability to report UTC level readiness
data. It provides one central location to archive reported data. It allows immediate updates and
ready access to an aggregate UTC status for all levels of command with sufficient depth of
information to make informed decisions on the employment of forces for AEF operations. It
further provides a means for identifying and analyzing actionable indicators of change.
     1.6.1. ART is a web-based, non-intrusive, html-environment tool with associated databases
     to support collection, collation, and report generation of unit and aggregate UTC readiness
     data. It resides on the SIPRNET (https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil/) for secure
     access. Units that are levied UTC taskings under AEF, view and report their status against
     these taskings directly within the ART application.
     1.6.2. ART's report generating capability allows all levels of command to arrange data to
     produce tailored written reports and graphics. The reports section is read-only and can be
     accessed by anyone with SIPRNET access.
     1.6.3. A       fully   functional    training      site    exists      on    the     NIPRNET
     (https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.mil/). This site also allows personnel to review the ART
     tutorial and other guidance. There are no restrictions on this site; anyone can login and enter
     training data or experiment with the report section. DO NOT enter real world data on the
     training site.
     1.6.4. Operationally, ART supports the goals stated above by collecting and collating unit-
     reported data to answer, in whole or in part, the following associated questions:
        1.6.4.1. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their MISCAP defined mission if
        tasked
        1.6.4.2. Are AEF allocated UTCs able to accomplish their component tasked mission?
        1.6.4.3. Do adequate resources exist and is training available in order to accomplish and
        sustain the AEF mission(s)?
     1.6.5. ART complements readiness data reported in Status of Resources and Training
     Systems (SORTS). ART focuses reporting on the modular scalable capability-based UTC‘s
     designed to meet the needs of the 21st century force while SORTS is unit-centric with
AFI10-244_ACCSUP_JBLANGLEY-EUSTISSUP_I 2 MAY 2012                                              7


  reporting based on major war (MW) commitments. The basis for both systems is the AEF
  Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) library (Once the UTC Availability Module
  (UTA) is available in DCAPES, it will be the basis.). The tasking baseline contained in ART
  is derived from the AEF Time Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD) library which
  supports the range of military operations (ROMO). Readiness assessments for MW and AEF
  tasking must be considered together; however, the reporting guidelines for each may be
  independent. A unit‘s C level as reported in SORTS may not directly correlate to its ability to
  support a specific UTC tasking as indicated in ART.

                           ORGANIZATION RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. ART Reporting. Unit commander assessments reported in ART present the status of each
UTC in the AEF library; and they provide higher levels of command the necessary information
to make force and resource allocation decisions to effectively support theater commanders.
Within the AEF construct, the UTC assessments are used to determine the most effective force
tasking. Effective management of Air Force resources requires accurate information at all levels.
For these reasons integrity in reporting an accurate status is paramount. ART is not a report card,
but a method of identifying a UTCs ability to perform its MISCAP and identify shortages of
resources therefore, commanders must "tell it like it is."
2.2. Headquarters USAF.
     2.2.1. Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF). Responsible for organizing, training, and
     equipping aerospace forces to meet CCDR requirements. Final approving authority for

     forms to the wing or equivalent records manager to determine appropriate records
     management and to ensure management of data does not adversely impact on the AF
     Records Management Program.
        2.7.3.7.1. (Added-ACC) Responsibilities. Clearly specify responsibilities for
        individuals (e.g. wing commander, group commander, unit commander, section
14                  AFI10-244_ACCSUP_JBLANGLEY-EUSTISSUP_I 2 MAY 2012


     chiefs, wing ART managers, etc.) involved in               training   personnel   and
     preparing/ensuring the accuracy of unit ART reports.
        2.7.3.7.1.1. (Added-JBLANGLEY-EUSTIS) Unit ART monitors serve as the
        focal point for the unit. They are responsible for making all appropriate updates
        in ART. Unit ART monitors will present the information contained in ART to the
        unit commander to ensure UTCs are reported correctly.
     2.7.3.7.2. (Added-ACC) Training. Specify training requirements for ART POCs
     identifying mandatory criteria and time schedules. Personnel will be required as a
     minimum to review AFI 10-244, the training aids found under the help dropdown
     menu on the ART website and a review of chapters 1 though 8 and appendix 1 and 2
     of the ART 3.0 User‘s Manual (which can also be found under the help menu).
        2.7.3.7.2.1. (Added-JBLANGLEY-EUSTIS) Unit commanders will appoint
        the Unit ART monitor in writing to 633 LRS/LGRDX. Unit ART monitors will
        receive initial training from 633 LRS/LGRDX within 30 days of being assigned.
        Unit ART monitors will not be granted an ART account without initial training.
     2.7.3.7.3. (Added-ACC) Reporting Procedures. Include step-by-step procedures
     accomplished in compiling and submitting ART reports. Wings should delegate the
     responsibility to rate UTCs in ART to the lowest organizational level responsible for
     the UTC (i.e., the squadron commander or equivalent of the unit the UTC is postured
     against) and ensure SIPRNET access.
        2.7.3.7.3.1. (Added-JBLANGLEY-EUSTIS) Reporting Procedures: The unit
        ART monitor will enter updated data in each assigned UTC at a minimum of
        every 30 calendar days. In order to generate a Commander‘s Approval –
        Readiness Assessment Report, all UTCs must be placed in CC Review. The unit
        commander must review and sign the commander‘s approval in the ART
        database. Note – It is the unit ART Monitor‘s responsibility to report on UTCs in
        the correct timeline when there are more than 30 days in a month.
        2.7.3.7.3.2. (Added-JBLANGLEY-EUSTIS) Unit ART monitors will maintain
        each signed Commander‘s Approval Report used for the last ART update in an
        approved safe.
        2.7.3.7.3.3. (Added-JBLANGLEY-EUSTIS) The wing ART monitor will
        review additions, changes, and deletions in the ART database daily and notify
        affected units. If a UTC is ―overdue‖ in the MAJCOM Compliance Report, an
        assessment of that UTC is over 30 days old. If a UTC is ―invalid,‖ the UTC
        readiness assessment is invalid and must be re-accomplished (typically due to a
        Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging (MEFPAK) change). If a UTC is
        ―not reported,‖ no UTC readiness assessment has been accomplished or a change
        in UTC has occurred. The three UTC statuses above are reporting deficiencies
        until corrected by the unit ART monitor.
        2.7.3.7.3.4. (Added-JBLANGLEY-EUSTIS) Unit ART monitors will update
        the UTCs within 24 hours of notification of deficient UTCs.
        2.7.3.7.3.5. (Added-JBLANGLEY-EUSTIS) Unit ART monitors will log into
AFI10-244_ACCSUP_JBLANGLEY-EUSTISSUP_I 2 MAY 2012                                          15


             ART every 15 calendar days to pull an aggregated UTC report to ensure their
             UTCs will not go overdue.
             2.7.3.7.3.6. (Added-JBLANGLEY-EUSTIS) When UTC reporting deficiencies
             are not corrected IAW this instruction, they will be forwarded to the unit
             commander for immediate action and briefed to the Wing Commander monthly.
     2.7.3.8. (Added-ACC) Wing ART manager or equivalent will disseminate MAJCOM
     ART POC correspondence of interest (i.e., ART policy messages, etc.) to unit
     commanders and unit ART POCs, as required, on a timely basis to ensure prompt
     response to HHQ requirements.
     2.7.3.9. (Added-ACC) Wing ART manager or equivalent will establish and maintain
     ART continuity folder(s) or binder(s) IAW the AF RDS to contain as a minimum the
     following documents:
         2.7.3.9.1. (Added-ACC) Copies of the appointment letters for wing and subordinate

         organizations, DSN, and classified and unclassified e-mail addresses. A classified e-
         mail address must be included for write-access to the ART to be granted. If the user
         does not have their own account, they may provide an office or supervisor's email
         address.
         2.7.4.2.2. (Added-ACC) Unit ART POCs will establish and maintain ART
         continuity folder(s) or binder(s) IAW the AF RDS to contain the following

          Procedures should ensure all concerned offices coordinate on or provide the required
          data to the unit ART POC prior to the unit commander's approval to enter the UTC
          rating in ART.
          2.7.4.3.2. (Added-ACC) Unit commanders must be continually cognizant of current
          and projected resource status in order to provide accurate Get Well Date (GWD)
          projections when submitting ART assessments.
          2.7.4.3.3. (Added-ACC) Commanders shall approve all unit UTC assessments prior
          to the unit ART POC updating the ART database.
      2.7.4.4. Ensure data and remarks adequately and accurately reflect the UTC's capability.
      2.7.4.5. Ensures report submissions meet established time lines.
      2.7.4.6. Review discrepancies noted in previous reports and actions being taken to
      correct them. Release the report for entry into the ART system.
      2.7.4.7. If discrepancies are noted between other deployment tasking databases and the
      UTA information loaded in ART, it is incumbent on the unit to research the disconnect
      and work to resolve the issue with MAJCOM FAMs.
      2.7.4.8. DELETED
   2.7.5. Units Required to Report. All Air Force units including Air National Guard and
   Reserve components owning UTCs allocated in an AEF or designated an enabler will report
   the status of their UTCs IAW this instruction.
2.8. Total Force Integration (TFI) Readiness Reporting Policy
   2.8.1. TFI units are critical to Air Force operations. They are organizational constructs that
   functionally integrate units from the regular Air Force, Air National Guard, and Air Force
   Reserve. Each unit in the association (host and associate) will independently report their
   readiness in ART.

                                  REPORTING POLICIES

3.1. Classification. ART contains real world deployment and personnel data. It is incumbent on
all personnel to be aware of the classification of data entered in ART. A UTC assessments in
ART is classified confidential, aggregate unit UTC reports are classified secret IAW Executive
Order (EO) 12958. Do not enter data that is classified under other guidance such as "Special
Access Required" information.
3.2. ART Data Classification. Executive Order (EO) 12958, Classified National Security
Information, requires us to protect classified information while striking a balance between
protection and the need to inform the American public of their governmental activities.
Additionally, this EO increases and emphasizes personal responsibility for classification and
declassification decisions.
   3.2.1. Derivative Classification. Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing,
   restating, or generating in a new form information that is already classified, and marking the
   newly developed material consistent with the classification markings that apply on the source
   information.
       3.2.1.1. Derivative Classifier. Persons applying derivative classification markings must
       carry forward to any newly created document the classification markings from the
       original source or document.
       3.2.1.2. ART assessment data (i.e., color codes, missing resources detailed in remarks,
       and limiting factors) for a single UTC, is classified at a minimum CONFIDENTIAL.
       3.2.1.3. Aggregate ART assessments (two or more UTC assessments) are classified
       SECRET. ART data converted to a new type information must be evaluated for its impact
       on national security if released.
       3.2.1.4. Data classification. Raw resource data used to derive UTC assessments is
       classified IAW it‘s original source. When data is directly associated with an ART rating
       or used in an ART worksheet, the data becomes classified IAW this guidance.
       Preformatted worksheets should be clearly marked with instructions on classification.
       3.2.1.5. Classification Authority. As with SORTS, ART combines elements of the
       JOPES database with assessments of the ability of units to provide combat capability.
       The assessments are used in the Air Force war-planning effort as a readiness feed to the
       Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segments (DCAPES) which
       parallels SORTS and JOPES war-planning capability. The Joint Staff SORTS database is
       classified SECRET. Information extracted from this database is classified IAW, CJCSI
       3401.02 and must contain derivative classification markings consistent with EO 12958,
       except where authorized otherwise. Derivative classification rules apply when extracts
       contain exempted data. ART will follow this same rule set and classification guidance.
       3.2.1.6. Classification Marking. ART data or extracts are classified by this AFI. Mark
       documents or data ―DERIVED FROM: AFI 10-244 dated 12 Sep 05, Declassify on:
       (date).‖ The date of declassification is 4 years from the date of the document for each
       level of classification. Declassification timeline is 4 years for CONFIDENTIAL, 8 years
 18                       AFI10-244_ACCSUP_JBLANGLEY-EUSTISSUP_I 2 MAY 2012


       for SECRET. See DOD 5200.1r, Information Security Program and CJCSM 3150.02
       Global Status of Resources and Training for additional classification guidance.
       3.2.1.7. Downgrading Authority. Initial downgrading of force readiness data and
       aggregate information will be determined by CJCS. HQ USAF/A3/5 is the authority to
       extend or accelerate downgrading classification of ART and SORTS data following an
       initial determination by CJCS.
3.3. What to Report. Commanders will report the unit‘s current ability through the next six
months to support each allocated UTC. NOTE: ART uses an extract of the approved UTC/UIC
AEF assignment of forces in the UTC Availability. A-UTCs are not currently reported in ART.
ART is a source for AEF UTC/UIC alignment for the unit commander.
   3.3.1. Units reporting SORTS with UTCs allocated to an AEF or identified as an enabler
   shall continue to report SORTS IAW their Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statement
   and AFI 10-201, in addition to reporting in ART.
3.4. UTC Assessments. Assessments are based on all aspects of the UTC to include: (1) the
ability to perform the capability defined by the Mission Capability (MISCAP) Statement, (2) can
fulfill the standard manpower requirements, and (3) can fulfill the complete equipment
requirements.     The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) Logistics Detail
(LOGDET) and Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) of the Manpower and
Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK) will be used to maintain the manpower and
equipment requirements.
   3.4.1. Response Time. A UTC readiness assessment is based on resources that are expected
   to be mission ready and available within their DOC response time, (if the UTC is referenced
   in the unit‘s DOC statement), or within 72 hours of tasking or less depending on the UTC
   requirements. A UTC is eligible to be tasked to perform its mission at any time.
   3.4.2. The Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) provides a brief description of the
   capability for which the UTC is designed.
   3.4.3. The Logistic Force Packaging Subsystem (LOGFOR) provides a list of equipment the
   UTC requires to perform the mission.
   3.4.4. The Manpower Force Packaging System (MANFOR) contains the manpower detail
   required to provide the capability for a standard UTC.
   3.4.5. Commanders provide an assessment of UTC readiness based on the unit's ability to
   provide the UTC for mission execution at any time.
   3.4.5. (ACC) Unit commanders may use all ACC resources within their unit or wing if
   those resources will be available to the unit for contingency use. Personnel are considered
   available if they are assigned to a unit, are physically present at home station, or can be
   present within the prescribed unit response time and are not restricted from deploying or
   employing with the unit. Resources belonging to another unit will not be counted in UTC
   ratings unless some type of agreement is documented IAW AF RDS prior to using the
   resources for reporting purposes. Resources used to assess one unit's capability may not be
   used for the same purpose by another unit. Double counting of personnel or equipment is
   prohibited.
AFI10-244_ACCSUP_JBLANGLEY-EUSTISSUP_I 2 MAY 2012                                          19


  3.4.6. Commanders are not constrained by the unit SORTS "C" rating when assessing the
  health of the UTC.
  3.4.7. Commanders rate each UTC against the unit's current ability to deploy and employ
  the UTC. Areas to be considered are personnel, equipment, training, and equipment
  condition. Personnel must be worldwide mobility qualified and have all required mission and
  skill level training complete IAW applicable directives and instructions. Equipment must be
  serviceable and available for deployment.
     3.4.7.1. Equipment and supplies on hand reporting includes the status of LOGFOR
     equipment and supplies required to support the UTC. It may indicate budget and supply
     problems when details are known. Commanders determine the readiness status based on
     the availability of mission required equipment and supplies. Items are considered
     available if they are assigned to the unit and are physically present at the unit for
     deployment.
         3.4.7.1.1. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For
         ―rainbowed‖ UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements,
         but shares the equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should
         be assessed as Red, since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to
         deployment. For a rainbowed UTC a comment should be entered to indicate the status
         of the shared equipment.
            3.4.7.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) Personnel/equipment on temporary duty (TDY).
            Consider personnel and /or equipment who are TDY (as opposed to deployed
            under a tasking) available for UTC rating/tasking under the following conditions:
            if the personnel and/or equipment are expected to be able to return to the unit
            within the unit DOC response time or 72 hours if no response time is given, report
            as GREEN. However, the commander has the discretion to report personnel
            and/or equipment as YELLOW if there is a concern the TDY personnel may not
            be able to return within the DOC response time or 72 hours. Commanders should
            not report TDY personnel and equipment as RED unless they are positive the
            employed resources will not be able to return as directed. In this case, place a
            GWD estimate in ART of when they will return to the unit. In remarks, indicate
            where they are TDY, name of operation, and any other details known.
            3.4.7.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) When a unit temporarily transfers (lends) personnel
            to another unit, the supplying unit will continue to measure and report the
            personnel unless otherwise directed by the MAJCOM. Likewise, a unit receiving
            personnel from another unit will not measure or count those personnel unless
            otherwise directed by the MAJCOM. Temporary assignment of personnel will
            not be justification for improved readiness levels.
            3.4.7.1.1.3. (Added-ACC) It would be illogical to count each and every item on
            the Logistics Detail (LOGDET), until further notice, equipment and supplies are
            defined as those mobility coded (use code A) items listed in the Allowance
            Standards (AS). NOTE: Shortages of some non-"A" coded items may affect
            mission accomplishment and should be considered in the assessment.
20                      AFI10-244_ACCSUP_JBLANGLEY-EUSTISSUP_I 2 MAY 2012


     3.4.7.2. The equipment condition area is used to determine the combat essential and
     support equipment that can be made ready within the UTC's response time to undertake
     the mission. Units assess the equipment condition for combat essential and support
     equipment based on the availability of required equipment.
         3.4.7.2.1. Units should report the status of UTCs as stand-alone requirements. For
         ―rainbowed‖ UTCs where a UTC has both personnel and equipment requirements,
         but shares the equipment with a sister organization already deployed, the UTC should
         be assessed as Red, since it does not currently have the required equipment prior to
         deployment. For a rainbowed UTC a comment should be entered to indicate the status
         of the shared equipment.
     3.4.7.3. The training assessment area indicates the status of training needed to support
     the mission for which a UTC is designed (MISCAP). All personnel assigned to a UTC
     must have all required mission and skill level training completed IAW applicable
     directives and instructions at the time of assessment. Individual training not required by
     the UTC (MISCAP or manpower detail) will not affect the readiness assessment but will
     be captured for deployment readiness tracking.
     3.4.7.4. DELETED
  3.4.8. Commanders are expected to use their judgment during assessments of missing or
  deficient capabilities (i.e. shortage of one computer may not make a UTC red; shortage of
  one generator may, similarly a member on a 72 hour medical profile would not require a
  UTC status change, whereas a person with a broken leg would). Remarks should reflect
  training requirements and/or resource actions necessary to improve the readiness status.
  3.4.9. In addition and independent of the stoplight (Green, Yellow, Red) assessment, each
  unit will indicate if a UTC is tasked to deploy and, if tasked, whether it can meet theater
  specific requirements including line remarks IAW timing criteria.
  3.4.10. When substitutions, not explicitly allowed in the MISCAP but authorized IAW AFI
  10-401 guidance, are used in ART reporting, they will be noted using the Standard
  Assessment Remark of AFSC, Skill Level Training or Grade, and drive at a minimum a
  "Yellow" UTC assessment.
  3.4.11. If a portion of a UTC is tasked to deploy, the remaining assets continue to be
  available for the entire deployment eligibility window. Commanders should indicate this in a
  remark.
  3.4.12. Commanders will continue to submit an overall UTC assessment that treats the
  deployed portion of that UTC as available and healthy unless circumstances/information
  warrants otherwise. Commanders will also continue to submit an overall UTC assessment for
  complete UTCs that have deployed. If a UTC is deployed and was being assessed as Green,
  commanders will continue to assess the UTC as Green unless circumstances/information
  warrants otherwise. For UTCs that were deployed while being assessed Yellow or Red,
  commanders will continue with that assessment until circumstances/information warrants
  upgrading the assessment.
AFI10-244_ACCSUP_JBLANGLEY-EUSTISSUP_I 2 MAY 2012                                                21


3.5. Assess the overall health of a UTC. The UTC represents a capability that is assessed
using the category areas described in paragraph 3.4.7. The overall assessment will be rated using
the following guidelines and the ART Monitor Assessment checklist (Attachment 2).
   3.5.1. Green. The complete UTC to include the exact MANFOR and LOGFOR equipment
   with only MISCAP explicit substitutions and all training for the AEF allocated UTC are
   available for deployment within 72 hours of notification or sooner if subject to more stringent
   criteria.
   3.5.2. Yellow. The UTC has a missing or deficient MANFOR or LOGFOR requirement; but
   that missing or deficient capability does not prevent the UTC from being tasked and
   accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation. This includes AFI 10-403
   approved standard substitutions. Provide a detailed explanation in remarks. Describe the
   condition, the corrective action and provide a projected get-well date. In the event that a skill
   level or grade is dependent only on a members‘ promotion it still needs to be noted and still
   drives a ‗Yellow‘ state.
   3.5.3. Red = No Go. The UTC has a missing or deficient capability that prevents the UTC
   from being tasked and accomplishing its mission in a contingency and/or AEF rotation.
   Provide detailed explanation of the shortfall in remarks. Describe the shortfall, the corrective
   action and provide a get-well date.
   3.5.4. Incorrectly Postured. This rating is to be used when a UTC is postured against a unit
   in ART and the unit commander believes this to be in error. Assigning this rating in ART
   will generate an email to the MAJCOM ART POC, raising the issue with the MAJCOM
   FAM to help determine whether or not the UTC is correctly postured. A detailed explanation
   is to be provided in the email of why the UTC should not be postured against your unit. This
   information will be forwarded to the MAJCOM UTC FAM ,who postured the UTC against
   the unit, for coordination and resolution.
   3.5.5. Think of the monthly assessment as a Yes/No process (Figure 3.1). Additionally, a
   Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it can meet
   theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2).
   3.5.6. (Added-ACC) Incorrectly Postured/Allocated = Questionable. Use this rating when
   a UTC is postured against a unit in ART and the unit commander believes this to be in error,
   to raise the issue with the HQ ACC FAM as to whether they correctly postured the UTC.
   Assigning this rating in ART will generate an email to the ACC ART POC (A3OR). Provide
   a detailed explanation in the email of why the UTC should not be postured against your unit.
   This information will be forwarded to the UTC FAM responsible for posturing the UTC for
   coordination and resolution. A common error is rating a UTC incorrectly postured when no
   individual is assigned. Funded authorizations from the unit manning document are used to
   create UTCs. If there is no individual assigned to the authorization it does not mean the UTC
   is incorrectly postured. In this instance rating the UTC red or yellow and using the ―vacant‖
   personnel deficiency category would be appropriate.

Figure 3.1. Monthly Assessment Process.




3.6. Tasked to Deploy Assessment. Upon deployment notification, commanders owning
UTC‘s tasked to deploy, in whole or in part, are required to assess the UTCs ability to meet
theater specific requirements to include line remarks. Each unit commander‘s UTC tasking
assessment is the Air Force‘s certification of forces. This assessment is independent of the
overall UTC stoplight assessment. As an example, a UTC may not have a person with specific
skill level and experience required by line remarks, however the UTC status (Green, Yellow,
Red) does not change since the stoplight assessment is based on the UTCs ability to deploy
anywhere in the world at the time of the assessment. Another example is a Red UTC assessment
due to equipment which could be tasked to support a personnel only theater requirement. Even
though it can meet that specific deployment tasking, the overall status is still Red.
   3.6.1. A Yes/No process can be used when assessing if a UTC is tasked to deploy and if it
   can meet theater specific requirements (Figure 3.2).
AFI10-244_ACCSUP_JBLANGLEY-EUSTISSUP_I 2 MAY 2012                                               23


Figure 3.2. Tasked to Deploy Assessment Process.




3.7. Remarks. Plain language supplemental remarks are a critical component of the ART report
and are used as a management tool. Remarks are required if a unit is less than fully capable in
any reportable area. Remarks are used to identify trends and to redirect resources if necessary.
Remarks are mandatory for UTCs assessed Yellow and Red. All status remarks will be
standardized remarks from Standard Assessment Remarks listing maintained within ART (ART
Guidance under Information Tab) only. However, the Commander‘s Remarks section is an
additional avenue that should be utilized to relay vital information that affects the readiness or
availability of the UTC. This area of ART can be utilized regardless of the readiness status of the
UTC (i.e., Green, Yellow, or Red).
   3.7.1. Commanders use the remarks and associated get-well-dates (GWD) to explain and
   amplify data contained in ART reports. Write remarks in plain text English and ensure they
   contain all appropriate details such as AFSCs, projected improvements, workarounds, etc.
   Remarks should be sufficient to allow responsible managers to take specific corrective
   action. The remarks sections are not size limited.
   3.7.2. As applicable, list resource types with associated deficiencies; state numbers required,
   assigned, and available; explain the cause of the problem, if known; identify previously
   requested assistance; identify remedial actions in progress, highlight further actions required,
   and provide a projection of when the readiness status will change.
       3.7.2.1. (Added-ACC) Identify exactly why the UTC is RED or YELLOW. If it is
       short of personnel, list how many short of each AFSC, what is the impact and what you
       are doing to get more personnel e.g., short two 2G071s can‘t accomplish logistics support

      for beddown of 12 PAA; working with HQ ACC FAM for more manpower. GWD: 5
      March 2002).
      3.7.2.2. (Added-ACC) If training is needed, identify what AFSCs needs what training.
      Identify how and when your commander is going to fix it (e.g., two 3E051 need Silver
      Flag training. Without training, the individuals are not prepared to provide bare base
      electrical support. Individuals scheduled for class on 30 November 2008.).
      3.7.2.3. (Added-ACC) If the UTC is short on equipment or supplies, identify exactly
      what equipment is short or not in a condition to deploy e.g., short two 60-kw generators.
      Without the generator the kitchen tent will not have power. We are working with the
      FAM for funding to order replacement generators.
   3.7.3. Air Force standard abbreviations are acceptable. However, non-common, unique, or
   unit/system/functional specific acronyms will be defined when first used in a report. Do not
   refer to previous reports (ART is dynamic and will not retain previous remarks).
   3.7.4. Wing Commanders should challenge inadequate remarks. MAJCOMs will sample,
   review, and assess adequacy of unit remarks.
3.8. When to Report. All Air Force and Air Force gained units will submit and update UTC
assessments every 30 calendar days. The Air Force goal for on-time reporting is 97%.
   3.8.1. Upon notification of a significant event that changes the assessment of a UTC the unit
   commander will submit an out-of-cycle report within 24 hours of the change. This includes
   notification of a UTC change or addition.
   3.8.2. Additionally, commanders owning UTC's tasked to deploy will submit via ART an
   assessment of their ability to support the tasking, including theater specific requirements,
   within five (5) days of receipt of a deployment notification.
   3.8.3. Units owning a UTC tasked to deploy will reset the deployment status from "Yes" to
   "No" not later than five (5) calendar days after the tasked resources return to home station.
3.9. Where to Report. ART is accessed from the AFPC/DPW homepage located at the
following URL https://aefcenter.afpc.randolph.af.smil.mil/. Click on the ―AEF UTC
Reporting Tool‖ link. Users are required to have SIPRNET access in order to submit ART
updates.

             Table A2.1. ART Monitor Assessment Checklist.
All units MUST use this checklist as a tool to assess UTC Personnel, Training, Equipment/ Supplies and        Current AEF
Equipment Condition (PTEC) monthly in ART. ALWAYS consider what the UTC's MISCAP states when
assessing.
GREEN = There are absolutely NO UTC deficiencies in any of the four assessed areas                        G
YELLOW = UTC can meet MISCAP but there are deficiencies to be noted                                             Y
RED = UTC cannot meet MISCAP due to too many deficiencies                                                             R
BLACK = UTC is postured incorrectly and requires MAJCOM FAM attention.

Check the appropriate shaded block (G, Y, R) below, depending on how you answer the question. The lowest rating in any
area will drive the overall rating of the UTC. Any deficiencies must have remarks and Get Well Dates (GWD); check each
month for expiration. Only the FINAL rating is used in ART.

Refer to the MISCAP, MANFOR, LOGFOR, MILPDS, AFI 10-244 (Ch 3), AFI 10-401 and AFI 10-403.

Once an individual is associated to an AEF they cannot be changed without obtaining a MAJCOM/CV waiver IAW AFI 10-401,
