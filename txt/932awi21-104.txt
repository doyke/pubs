1. General: This instruction establishes debriefing policies and procedures. This program is
essential to ensure malfunctions identified by aircrews are properly reported and documented.
Clear and concise maintenance debriefing is essential to effectively troubleshoot and repair
aircraft discrepancies.
2. Responsibilities: Operations and Maintenance Group commanders, and their unit
commanders, are responsible for compliance with this publication. All aircraft debriefings are
conducted in a thorough and professional manner. The Maintenance Group commander ensures
local procedures are established to document the causes and corrective actions of all aborts and
in-flight emergencies, and to ensure data is reviewed by the performing work center supervisor,

aircraft maintenance supervision, Quality Assurance (QA), and maintenance data systems
analysis (MDSA).
3. Procedures: To ensure that proper information is received and entered into the Maintenance
Information System (MIS), use the following local guidelines:
     3.1. If the MIS is inoperable, the Debriefing Section will retain all necessary documentation
     until the MIS is operable.
        3.1.1. During flight operations, aircrews will report any in-flight discrepancy to the
        Command Post approximately twenty minutes prior to landing. The Command Post will
        notify the Maintenance Operations Center (MOC), who will contact the appropriate work
        center to have them report to the aircraft or the Debrief Section as required.
        3.1.2. Normal Debrief At Home Station:
            3.1.2.1. All sorties will be debriefed in the Maintenance Operations Center. As a
            minimum, the Aircraft Commander and the Crew Chief will be in attendance.
            3.1.2.2. The Aircraft Commander will ensure that all discrepancies are identified and
            documented as clearly as possible in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance
            Discrepancy and Work Document.
            3.1.2.3. The Crew Chief will ensure that all required aircraft forms are complete and
            accurate.
            3.1.2.4. The debriefer will use a locally developed debriefing continuity book, AFI
            21-101 AFRC Sup I, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, and/or any
            other applicable guidance to complete the debrief.
        3.1.3. When Debrief Section Is Unavailable:
            3.1.3.1. The Aircraft Commander will ensure that all discrepancies are identified and
            documented as clearly as possible in the AFTO Form 781A.
            3.1.3.2. The Crew Chief will ensure that all required aircraft forms are complete and
            accurate.
            3.1.3.3. The aircraft forms binder will be retained by the Maintenance Squadron until
            the Debrief Section is available.
            3.1.3.4. The Debrief Section will complete the debrief as soon as possible after
            availability.
        3.1.4. Off Station Aircraft:
            3.1.4.1. The Aircraft Commander will ensure that all discrepancies are identified and
            documented as clearly as possible in the AFTO Form 781A.
            3.1.4.2. The Crew Chief will ensure that all required aircraft forms are complete and
            accurate.
                3.1.4.2.1. Manual job control numbers identified in 932 MXGOI 21-110, Manual
                Documentation and Job Control Number Assignement, will be used for all
                discrepancies discovered while off station.
                3.1.4.2.2. The AMC Form 278, Debriefing and Recovery Plan, (or locally
932AWI21-104 22 JULY 2011                                                                      3


            developed equivalent) and AFTO Form 781 for each mission leg will be sent
            daily, or as soon as the mission allows, to the MOC via e-mail or fax.
                3.1.4.2.2.1. When e-mail or fax is unavailable, the MOC will be contacted by
                the Crew Chief via telephone and given all necessary information.
        3.1.4.3. The Debrief Section will enter the discrepancies from the AMC Form 278
        (or locally developed equivalent) and the flying data from the AFTO Form 781 for
        each mission leg into the MIS no later than the next duty day after receiving the faxed
        forms.
            3.1.4.3.1. A final debrief will be performed in accordance with Paragraph 3.1.2
            upon return to home station. The Debrief Section will ensure that all previous
            mission legs have been debriefed and are accurately entered into the MIS.
     3.1.5. Aircraft Incident Reporting:
        3.1.5.1. If the aircrew reports an aircraft incident (abort, in-flight emergency, bird
        strike, lightning strike, etc.) to the Debrief Section, the debriefer will load incident-
        specific work package as required and ensure the incident is documented in as much
        detail as possible in the AFTO Form 781A and in the MIS.
