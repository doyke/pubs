1. Program.
     1.1. Program Objectives. Air Force golf courses are MWR activities providing a
     recreational outlet to enhance the mental and physical well-being of Air Force members and
     their families. Golf courses offer other services such as retail, snack bars, rental equipment,
     and instructional programs. Golf Course Operations Chiefs and their staffs offer their
     customers quality programs and facilities.
     1.2. Program Funding. Nonappropriated funds (NAFs) are the primary funding source for
     Air Force golf courses and are supported according to AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated
     Funds. Appropriated fund (APF) support is authorized in AFI 65-106, Appropriated Fund
     Support of Morale, Welfare and Recreation Programs (MWR) and Nonappropriated Fund
     Instrumentalities( NAFIS), for certain indirect APF support to all locations and some direct
     APF support to those locations classified as remote and isolated by the Office of Secretary of
     Defense (OSD).
     1.3. Program Participation. Follow the procedures in AFI 34-262, Services Programs and
     Use Eligibility, to establish eligibility, priority requirements, and approval authority for
     personnel using Air Force golf facilities.
        1.3.1. Tournaments or events sponsored by non-DoD organizations are not permitted
        without advance approval in accordance with AFI 34-262. Such usage is approved only
        if the approving authority determines on an individual basis each event or program
        benefits the Air Force by contributing to overall community relations. If the event is
        conducted as a fund-raising event, it must meet the requirements of AFI 36-3101,
        Fundraising Within the Air Force and AFI 34-223 Private Organizations (PO) Program.
        The following public use programs are authorized, provided they meet the above criteria:
             1.3.1.1. Annual base open house where all base facilities are open to the public.
             1.3.1.2. Base-hosted or co-hosted events connected with national, state, city, or local
             tournaments sponsored by non-DoD organizations with which Air Force personnel
             are affiliated.
             1.3.1.3. Events to support on- and off-base schools.

          personnel and non-DoD civilians.
      1.3.2. Use of Air Force facilities as outlined above and any use not listed require written
      statements from the owners or operators of local civilian golf facilities within 10 miles or
      30 commuting minutes stating they do not object. Other areas of concern about
      participation are:
          1.3.2.1. Do not use NAFs to subsidize the programs addressed above.
          1.3.2.2. Prohibit the free use of facilities or the purchase of trophies or other related
          items from NAFs for these types of events. Exception: When holding reciprocal
          rotational events provided the installation commander approves each event.
          1.3.2.3. Generating income for Force Support activities supported by the base
          Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund (MWRF) are not used as justification to
          conduct these programs.
          1.3.2.4. Golf tournaments and prizes for golf tournaments must follow United States
          Golf Association (USGA) guidelines and rules (paragraph 3.3 Merchandise Gift
          Certificates).
   1.4. Junior Golf Programs.

      development of a junior golf program, Golf Course Operations Chiefs should establish a

      warrants. When offering a junior program, consider the following:
          1.4.1.1. Provide group or individual lessons at affordable rates.
          1.4.1.2. Include golf rules, etiquette, and life skills teachings.

       registered in the PGA’s Professional Golf Management (PGM) program, or is in the
       process of applying for the PGM. Contractors are not considered staff members.
       1.6.4. Hire golf professionals on an individual service contract as outlined in AFMAN

           Regulation must be satisfied. Golf Course Operations Chiefs or assistant managers
           cannot teach on an individual service contract.
       1.6.5. All fees charged for golf lessons are collected and accounted for through the golf
       shop cash register or point of sale system (POS).
    1.7. Golf Advisory Committee. This is an optional committee. The purpose of the Golf
    Advisory Committee is to make recommendations on local play, programs, course rules of

     in the layout and design of the golf shop. Use available marketing, merchandising, and
     design professionals available through Civil Engineering (CE), MAJCOM, or HQ AFSVA.
     Use a professional design consultant on all projects. Further guidance on the design of golf
     course facilities is available in the Air Force Clubhouse Design Guide (UFC 4-750-01 NF)
     under the Facilities area of the Air Force Services Agency web site.
     3.3. Merchandise Gift Certificates. Gift certificates won at installation tournaments can be
     redeemed in the golf shop for merchandise, range balls, green fees, and golf car rentals. In
     conjunction with USGA Rules of amateur status, gift certificates cannot be redeemed for
     cash or previously purchased merchandise. Gift certificates purchased as gifts are redeemed
     for any item or service per the discretion of the golf course manager. AFMAN 34-212,
     Control Procedures for Protecting NAF Assets, outlines procedures for issuance and
     controlling gift certificates. AFMAN 34-214 outlines procedures to account for gift
     certificates. Refer to AFI 34-202, Protecting Nonappropriated Fund Assets, for storing and
     protecting gift certificates.
     3.4. Special Order Programs. A special order is any item ordered not normally carried in
     stock/inventory and specially ordered for a customer from a vendor. Collect a deposit of at
     least 25% of the resale price for special order purchases as per AFMAN 34-214. In-house

4. Golf Course.
     4.1. Fees and Charges. Persons authorized to use Air Force golf facilities must pay
     established fees. Free play (except as noted below in paragraphs 4.1.1., 4.1.1.1., and 4.1.1.2),
     free use of facilities and equipment, or discounted fees, (except as noted in paragraph 4.1.4.1
     below) are not authorized.
        4.1.1. The Golf Course Operations Chief, assistant manager, the golf course
        superintendent, and assistant superintendent are exempt from paying green fees when
        playing on a non-recurring basis for the purpose of reviewing the course and the turf
        conditions. Recurring and frequent course reviews are coordinated and approved by the
        flight chief.
            4.1.1.1. Any registered PGA professional or Golf Course Superintendents
            Association of America (GCSAA) member may play an Air Force course on a space
            available basis, without paying green fees, but must make a courtesy phone call to the
            facility manager to request permission.
            4.1.1.2. Free rounds of golf may be given for promotional or customer satisfaction
            purposes but must be identified in an approved OI, annotated in a log, and properly
            accounted on the financial statement.
        4.1.2. The Golf Course Operations Chief recommends fees and charges through the NAF
        Council.
AFI 34-116 24 JUNE 2011                                                                        9


      4.1.3. Establish fees in the following categories: 9 hole, 18 hole, advanced, twilight,
      punch cards (cards which offer a discount when purchasing a locally established quantity
      of golf rounds), and guest fees.
      4.1.4. Establish three fee structures. The first for E1-E4; the second for authorized users
      including active duty, DoD civilians (active or retired), and currently employed
      contractors assigned to the base; and the third for guests. The E1-E4 rate must be set at
      75% or less of the second structure.
         4.1.4.1. Advanced green fees are defined as a discounted fee for a 12-month period
         and are paid in a one-time lump sum payment. (For seasonal courses open less than
         12 months, the advance fee period must not exceed the number of months the course
         is open, and the inclusive months are indicated on the advance fee card.)
         4.1.4.2. Monthly payment of annual green fees is only authorized if billed through
         the Club Plus, or the contracted Air Force Services POS. The Club Plus software and
         manual can be downloaded from the HQ AFSVA web site. Coordinate use with the
         resource manager. The monthly payment option may be charged at a minimum of
         5% higher than 1/12 of the advance fee for each person. Customers electing
         automatic monthly charges for green fees must sign an agreement outlining the
         payment policies.
         4.1.4.3. The Air Force does not extend advance greens fee privileges to community
         leaders or other non-DoD civilians.
         4.1.4.4. A golf course may set up a family green fee plan with a fee for each family
         member or a single rate for all family members. Issue a separate greens fee card for
         each person in a family plan.
         4.1.4.5. Spouses and other relatives designated as authorized family members pay
         according to their sponsor's rate. When both husband and wife use the facility, the
         individual with the highest grade is considered the sponsor for annual green fee
         purposes.
         4.1.4.6. If the sponsor is not a golfer but other family members play, the course
         charges an annual fee at the sponsor’s rate.
         4.1.4.7. Guests (non-authorized users of Air Force facilities) pay the established and
         approved daily guest rate. Non-authorized users are not entitled to advance fees or
         punch cards.
         4.1.4.8. Retired military and their family members pay fees according to their retired
         military grade.
         4.1.4.9. DoD civilians, who are retired military, pay the higher of the two established
         rates.
         4.1.4.10. Include military and civilian grades in fee structures.
      4.1.5. Advance green fee customers are issued a controlled, pre-numbered card.
      Documentation is completed and signed by the purchaser, outlining the use of the card,
      refund policy, TDY policy, and reciprocal play policy. If the advance fee is based on the
      number of months the course is open, inclusive dates on the card indicates the months
10                                                                   AFI 34-116 24 JUNE 2011


     included in the payment of the advance fee. (If the golf facility is closed during non-
     seasonal play, the open and operation months must be reflected as start and ending dates
     on the card).
         4.1.5.1. The prorated portion of an advance greens fee card is refunded to the
         cardholder upon receiving permanent change of station (PCS), separation, retirement
         orders, valid and documented medical reasons, official notification of death, or when
         clearing the installation. When refunding on a PCS move, the advance fee card and a
         copy of PCS orders must be provided to the golf course before a refund is given.
         4.1.5.2. PCS refunds. The annual fee card may be retained and used in route to the
         new duty station as a full reciprocal privilege when showing PCS orders; however, it
         may not be used at the new home duty station to obtain reciprocal golf fees. The card
         must be returned to the base where issued and refunded from the date of mailing,
         based on the annual fee refund policy in effect at that base.
         4.1.5.3. Deployed personnel have advance green fee payment requirements waived if
         deployed for 30 days or more to a contingency location where a golf course is not
         available. This is accomplished by placing the person in a ―no fee‖ status during the
         deployment period, refunding a prorated amount of the advance payment, or
         extending the period of payment by the length of the deployment at no additional
         charge. Extend punch card expiration dates equal to the deployment time.
         4.1.5.4. As a guide to establishing daily or advance green fees, use the green fee
         formula located on the HQ AFSVS golf web page to assist in determining the proper
         fee.
     4.1.6. If golf club and locker storage spaces are available, authorize patrons to use on a
     first-come, first-served basis with priority given to active duty personnel. At overseas
     bases, DoD civilians may receive equal priority as active duty personnel.
     4.1.7. Private golf cars or storage of private golf cars is not authorized. Any private cars
     currently authorized for use, must be phased out by 31 December 2013. Private use of
     golf cars specifically designed for physically handicapped players are authorized
     providing proper medical documentation is presented; however, storage of these cars is
     not permitted. Establish owner liability requirements and trail fee before allowing use.
     Liability insurance is required.
  4.2. Reciprocal Play. Individuals with a current advanced green fee card and on official
  TDY orders are granted full reciprocal green fee privileges. When not on TDY orders, those
  with a current advance greens fee card, from their home course are given at least a 25 percent
  discount off the established per round rate after showing proper identification. Punch cards
  may not be used for reciprocal play.
     4.2.1. In locations with more than one Air Force golf facility (e.g., San Antonio TX;
     Colorado Springs CO; Ft. Walton Beach FL), installation commanders may develop local
     policies for reciprocal play as long as they are consistent with the facility usage priorities
     in AFI 34-262.
  4.3. Tee-Time Policies. The Golf Course Operations Chief develops tee-time policies for
  the approval of the Installation Commander. Tee-time priorities are in accordance with AFI
AFI 34-116 24 JUNE 2011                                                                        11


   34-262 (use Table A2.1., Unlimited Program Eligibility and Use Priority, and Table A2.2.,
   Limited Program Eligibility and Use Priority, to determine program access).
   4.4. Severe Weather Conditions. The golf course manager establishes written procedures
   for advising players of weather watches and warnings. As guidance, use AFI 10-229,
   Responding to Severe Weather Events; and AFOSH 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line - Ground
   Operations and Activities. The local base weather flight or designated Operational Weather
   Squadron (OWS) is responsible for making the initial notification and final cancellations to
   predetermined support agencies. Those agencies, in turn, will notify golf course personnel.
      4.4.1. A Lightning Watch is issued by the supporting weather unit and in effect 30
      minutes prior to thunderstorms being forecast within a five nautical mile radius of the
      designated base reference point. (Contact the local base weather flight or OWS to
      determine the designated base reference point for the base/installation and the golf
      course’s location to that point.) During a Lightning Watch, accomplish the following:
          4.4.1.1. Operations or activities may continue; however, all personnel must be
          prepared to implement Lightning Warning procedures without delay.
          4.4.1.2. Be alert for any lightning activity, to include audible thunder, and advise
          supervisory personnel of any observations.
          4.4.1.3. Advise players on the course and in the surrounding clubhouse and practice
          areas of the lightning watch.
      4.4.2. A Lighting Warning is issued and in effect whenever any lightning is occurring
      within a five nautical mile radius of the designated base reference point. Notify golfers to
      discontinue play and seek shelter. The golf course and all associated activities such as
      practice areas will be closed.
          4.4.2.1. Golf courses located further than five nautical miles from the designated
          installation reference point will contact their local weather flight to coordinate
          weather watch/warning support. If requested support is not available, golf courses
          will purchase lightning detection equipment or use web-based lightning data to meet
          requirements.
      4.4.3. Courses located in areas that commonly see heavy thunderstorm activity should
      provide appropriate protective shelters for players on course grounds.
          4.4.3.1. Signage such as the USGA Lightning Safety Tips will be posted in prominent
          areas. Non-lightning safe structures must be posted as such in shelters located on golf
          facility grounds and must include the location of the nearest lightning safe structure.
      4.4.4. Develop written lightning safety procedures for course maintenance workers.
   4.5. Rain Checks. The Golf Course Operations Chief develops a rain check policy
   documented with written procedures and approved by the Force Support Squadron
   Commander/Director.
   4.6. Professional Memberships. Do not use NAFs for personal memberships in
   organizations like the PGA or GCSAA, however, one ―desk‖ membership is authorized as
   prescribed in AFI 34-201, paragraph 4.1.2., for each professional organization.
 12                                                                  AFI 34-116 24 JUNE 2011


   4.7. Rental Clubs. Provide two levels of rental clubs. The first level, offered at the lowest
   rental rate, are clubs for the general golfing public. The second level, offered at a slightly
   higher rental rate, are clubs of an upgrade quality.
   4.8. Key Control. Control all keys and establish a key control log. Refer to AFI 34-202
   and AFMAN 34-212.
   4.9. Checklists. Establish opening and closing checklist for all operational sections
   including, but not limited to pro shop, snack bar, course maintenance, driving range, and golf
   carts.
5. Snack Bar Operations.
   5.1. Scope. The Golf Course Operations Chief establishes and maintains standards for
   customer service, preparation, presentation, and serving of food items. Total quality
   customer service is obtained by staff empowerment and development of sound organizational
   practices. Managers practice continuous employee training and stay abreast of industry
   trends and changes. Sound internal controls, quality purchasing, effective merchandising,
   and accurate assessments of customer markets are keys to success. The use of internal
   controls for controlling food and beverage items is the most important element in managing
   the cost of goods. Controlling waste, portions, deliveries by vendors, and theft is critical to
   the financial stability of the snack bar operation. Use standardized recipes, menu cost cards,
   POS data, and scatter sheets to more effectively control food costs. Refer to AFMAN 34-
   228, Air Force Club Program Procedures, for additional guidance on food controls.
   Procedural guidance is also found in AFI 34-202, AFI 34209, and AFI 34-219, Alcoholic
   Beverage Program.
      5.1.1. Golf course snack bars primarily sell fast-moving products and must attain a
      monthly inventory turnover rate and cost of goods in accordance with the Air Force Golf
      Standards, found at the HQ AFSVA web site.
      5.1.2. Combined cost of sales and cost of labor are in accordance with standards found
      on the HQ AFSVA web site.
   5.2. Purchasing. The golf course manager must follow these purchasing guidelines:
      5.2.1. Establish par stocks with reorder points for food and supply items. Base purchases
      on forecasted requirements. Local situations and contracts dictate the frequency and
      system of ordering. Consider cooperative buying with other Force Support activities
      using the Prime Vendor Program.
      5.2.2. Buy for specific needs. The intended use of an item dictates the quality required.
      5.2.3. Buy the portion size providing the best edible yield, at the best price, and suits the
      menu and consumption rate.
      5.2.4. Keep inventories as low as possible and within approved inventory levels.
   5.3. Receiving Procedures. The Golf Course Operations Chief designates, in writing,
   personnel authorized to receive purchases (personnel performing ordering function cannot be
   receivers). Every purchase is inspected for quantity or weight against the invoice.
      5.3.1. Document the receipt of free items on the receiving report.
AFI 34-116 24 JUNE 2011                                                                         13


      5.3.2. For food safety inspection frequencies, see AFI 48-116, Food Safety Program, or
      the USDA Food Code.
   5.4. Food Storage. Control refrigerator temperatures to prevent spoilage, maintain quality,
   and prevent food poisoning. The golf course manager must:
      5.4.1. Keep storage loss to a minimum. Storage includes refrigeration (both freezer and
      chilled), dry storage, in-use storage, and leftover storage.
      5.4.2. Use first-in, first-out procedures.
      5.4.3. Provide thermometers for all refrigeration units and record the temperature
      readings at the beginning and end of each day, per AFMAN 34-228 para 3.4.3.
          5.4.3.1. Have signs posted on the outside of walk-in cooler doors stating, ―Ensure
          no one is inside before closing or locking.‖
          5.4.3.2. Coordinate with the flight chief or another activity manager for designated
          emergency cold storage.
          5.4.3.3. Display a prominent sign in the refrigeration area, reading, ―The emergency
          number to be called for loss of refrigeration is ______.‖
   5.5. Portion Control. Portion control is one of the most important factors of food cost. The
   golf course manager ensures each food item served is assigned the exact weight, volume,
   size, or count as established on menu cost cards. Convenience or prepackages items provide
   desired portion control.
   5.6. Menu Cost Cards. The golf course manager develops menu cost cards for each menu
   item served. As a minimum, use established Club menu cost cards for like items.
      5.6.1. Menu cost cards are reviewed quarterly and revised as required.
      5.6.2. Menu cost cards include recipe title, selling price, ingredients, portion size, recipe
      cost, desired food cost percentage, number of servings, and contribution margin (profit).
   5.7. Beverage Sales. AFI 34-219 provides instructions on the sale of alcoholic beverages
   for all Air Force activities. Refer to AFI 34-272 for specific guidance on operating an
   effective beverage management program. Activities supported by the base MWRF may sell
   those alcoholic beverages authorized by the installation commander.
   5.8. Food and Beverages from Outside Sources. Only food and beverages sold on the
   premises can be consumed in/on the facility or grounds. Golf course management, with
   proper coordination and approval from base public health, may consider case-by-case
   exceptions of specialty food items not provided by the golf course.
   5.9. Equipment Maintenance. Maintain an equipment log containing a description of each
   piece of equipment, date acquired, maintenance, cleaning schedules, and agency responsible
   for maintenance.
      5.9.1. The Golf Course Operations Chief must establish cleaning and preventive
      maintenance schedules for all equipment in accordance with the manufacturer’s
      maintenance schedules.
 14                                                                  AFI 34-116 24 JUNE 2011


          5.9.1.1. Keep a work order log to track repairs and report unresolved problems to the
          flight chief.
          5.9.1.2. Forecast when equipment will wear out and budget for replacement.
          5.9.1.3. Sanitation. The kitchen, food preparation areas, and food storage areas can
          present major sanitation problems. These areas must be kept clean, neat, and orderly
          at all times.
   5.10. Training and Employee Development. An effective employee training program is
   essential to a successful food and beverage operation. The golf courses’ Income and
   Expense budget must include funding for employee training and development. Include
   training for NAF food and beverage management as well as the staff. Be sure to budget for
   all costs related to training (payroll, supplies, tuition, and travel) include food handlers and
   serve safe training. Send staff members to appropriate HQ AFSVA and MAJCOM
   sponsored courses, and applicable locally available education and training.
      5.10.1. The Golf Course Operations Chief ensures all employees serving and selling
      alcoholic beverages receive initial and annual training in dram shop theory, alcohol abuse
      awareness, alcohol deglamorization, and the Air Force Driving While Intoxicated (DWI)
      Prevention Program. Document this training in accordance with AFI 34-219.
6. Driving Range Operations.
   6.1. Facility. The key to a successful range operation is maintaining the highest possible
   standards for equipment and grounds. Market and advertise the driving range along with
   other areas of the operation.
      6.1.1. Driving range minimum standards are:
          6.1.1.1. Range clubs available for use or rent.
          6.1.1.2. Yardage signs, flags, or target greens.
          6.1.1.3. Provide clean range balls free of cuts or worn dimples.
          6.1.1.4. Post range safety, operational policies, and hours of operation.

          6.1.1.7. Offer ball dispensers with multi-payment options such as coins, bills,
          debit/credit cards, or tokens.
          6.1.1.8. Provide a bill-changing machine.
          6.1.1.9. To maximize the range operation and associated customer service, consult
          available sources such as the PGA, USGA, and the NGF (National Golf Foundation).
   6.2. Funds Collection Procedures. AFI 34-202, paragraph 3.20. and 3.21.; and AFMAN
   34-212, paragraph 6.2. and 6.3. provide mandatory guidance on funds harvested from the ball
   dispenser and change machine.
7. Golf Course Maintenance and Carts.
AFI 34-116 24 JUNE 2011                                                                              15


   7.1. Grounds Maintenance Objectives and Program. The golf course superintendent is
   the key link in establishing a viable program assuring the best possible turfgrass conditions
   for the best price. The superintendent plays an important role, not only in the success of the
   facility, but also to the vitality of the game itself. It is highly desirable the superintendent is a
   member of the GCSAA. They are responsible for every facet of the day-to-day and long-
   term management of what is likely to be your facility's most valuable asset. The
   superintendent is supervised by the golf course manager, working in tandem through regular
   coordination and communication to ensure the program reaches the program goals of all
   concerned. Procedural guidance is found in the following instructions: AFI 32-1053, Pest
   Management Program, AFI 32-1022, Planning and Programming Nonappropriated Fund
   Facility Construction Projects; AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management;
   and DoDI 4150.07, DoD Pest Management Program.
   7.2. Maintenance Plan. The golf course greens superintendent develops an annual
   maintenance plan and coordinates with the golf course manager prior to the manager
   scheduling tournaments for the year.
   7.3. Course Safety. The golf course superintendent must:
       7.3.1. Clearly mark all safety hazards on course that may cause injury to a customer.
       7.3.2. Post signs at all appropriate course water hazards that state ―Do Not Drink,‖ ―No
       Swimming,‖ and ―No Fishing‖ if the situation dictates warning signs for safety reasons.
       7.3.3. Supply sufficient drinking water on the course where and when needed.
           7.3.3.1. Water coolers are provided and maintained in accordance with the USGA
           ―Best Management Practice for Golf Course Water Cooler‖ available on HQ AFSVA

      industry and should attend on an annual basis to provide the best possible playing
      conditions and customer satisfaction.
      8.5.5. The golf course may establish an employee training program to enhance their
      work performance and knowledge of the game to include introductory golf lesson
      program participation and on-course play during non peak hours. This is formalized with
      an approved operating instruction through the Force Support Squadron
      Commander/Director.
   8.6. Planning. The Golf Course Operations Chief develops a 5-year plan updated annually
   and approved by the flight chief. The plan should include construction, renovation,
   equipment replacement, programs, and goals.
   8.7. Marketing. The Golf Course Operations Chief is required to develop an effective
   marketing plan annually using the standards in AFI 34-104, Services Marketing and Publicity

   units, private organizations, or unofficial activities or organizations (such as off-base
   organizations) are not authorized to use the commercial sponsorship program to offset
   program or activity expenses, even if held at a Force Support activity. The sale of
   advertising is authorized in/on established NAF funded media to include benches, tee
   markers, score cards and more. The Force Support Squadron marketing office is responsible
   for the advertising program IAW AFI 34-407 and AFMAN 34-416, Air Force Commercial
   Sponsorship and Sale of NAFI Advertising Procedures.
   8.9. Essential Products Program (EPP). EPP, part of the Commander’s Smart Buy
   Program, is designed to maximize purchasing leverage in the marketplace on products that
   are essential to NAF operations. The EPP effectively standardizes both quality and price for
   selected requirements, and its use is mandatory. Golf products are included in this program.
   The program provides an opportunity to purchase items at significant savings. EPP catalogs
   can be obtained from the AFNAFPO or viewed on their HQ AFSVA web site.
   8.10. Web-Based Golf Course Data. HQ AFSVA provides a comprehensive database for
   customers, golf managers, and greens superintendents. The golf course manager must update
   the database annually. Obtain access to the database through the web-based HQ AFSVA
   Information System.
