exclusively by the Department of the Air Force, as outlined in real estate documents or letters of
agreement. It directs the use of desktop applications as appropriate to Airfield Operations (AO).
This manual may be supplemented at any level, but all supplements that directly implement this
publication must be routed to the HQ Air Force Flight Standards Agency, Director of Airfield
Operations (HQ AFFSA/A3A) for coordination prior to certification and approval. Refer
