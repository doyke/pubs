1. Scope: This instruction is applies to the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center (WR-ALC) assigned
units, to include the 330th Aircraft Sustainment Wing (ASW), 542nd Combat Sustainment Wing (CSW),
402nd Maintenance Wing (MXW), 78 th Air Base Wing (ABW), WR-ALC/EN, WR-ALC/IT, and
WR-ALC/XP. This instruction does not include purchasing of commercial-off-the-shelf technologies and
does not change existing weapon system modification processes.

2. Purpose: This instruction standardizes the technology insertion process across WR-ALC by establish-
ing an institutionalized, repeatable and effective technology insertion process. The process will identify
and prioritize technology needs according to center goal and objectives, establish and identify the roles
and responsibilities of the participants, and formulate a comprehensive and integrated technology inser-
tion strategy over both near and long-term. This publication does not apply to Air Force Reserve Com-
mand (AFRC), individual mobilization augmentees, and other individual reservists administered by HQ
AFRC.

3. Process: WR-ALC/EN is responsible for the Technology Insertion Process (TIP). Figure 1. shows the
top level technology insertion process. As shown in Figure 1., technology insertion can start and stop at
various stages in the overall process. Maturity of the project, viability of the proposed solutions, and cen-
ter objectives are some of the drivers for various entry and exit points. Figure 2. is the detailed process
flow and shows the four major phases of a technology insertion effort – requirements generation, advo-
cacy, execution and implementation.

    3.1. Submit Concept. The TIP begins when the concept originator identifies a technology need. The
    TIP is structured to take an idea from any organization or individual. There are two avenues for sub-
    mitting technology needs for consideration: The Wing prioritized list or send an email to technol-
    ogy.proposals@robins.af.mil. The four primary sources are the Wing Technology Councils (WTC),
    individuals, industry and academia.
       3.1.1. Wing Technology Council. Each of the four wings shall have a wing technology council
       (WTC). Each council is co-chaired by the wing’s Director of Engineering (DoE) or Technology
       Director (TD) and a representative from the WR-ALC Technology and Reliability Branch. The
       78th ABW/CC will appoint a co-chair to represent their wing. WR-ALC/EN Technology and Reli-
       ability Branch (WR-ALC/ENFM) personnel will attend the WTC meeting and assist with the
       administrative functions (agenda, minutes, etc), brief status on projects, provide information on
       any submittals to funding sources and help maintain focus during the meeting. The wing co-chair
       will bring the appropriate participants (chief engineers, lead engineers, forward thinkers, etc) to
       the meeting and help solicit discussion and ideas.
           3.1.1.1. WTC Proposed Structure. The WTC structure may be implemented with a bottom up
           process. Each flight brings forth needs to the group; the group consolidates and prioritizes the
           needs, which they bring forward to the WTC. The WTC consolidates and prioritizes the group
ROBINSAFBI61-101 19 JULY 2007                                                                            5


         needs in to one wing list. This process should occur at least annually in response to a Center
         technology data call issued by WR-ALC/EN.
     3.1.2. Individuals. Any individual can submit an idea/need in accordance with paragraph 3.2.
     3.1.3. Industry. Any potential technology need identified by industry must first be presented to an
     organization or individual within one of the wings for sponsorship. The sponsor can then submit
     the idea/need in accordance with paragraph 3.2.
     3.1.4. Academia. Any potential technology need identified by academia must first be presented to
     an organization or individual within one of the wings for sponsorship. The sponsor can then sub-
     mit the idea/need in accordance with paragraph 3.2.
  3.2. Gather Information on Concept: Upon receiving a technology idea/need, it becomes a tech-
  nology “candidate need” and the WR-ALC/ENFM will do the following:
     3.2.1. Request identification of the wing technical point of contact and wing program manager for
     the need. These may be the same individual.
     3.2.2. Identify stakeholder organizations for formation of an IPT to guide the technology from
     concept definition to implementation.
     3.2.3. Identify a potential funding source(s) for each need. WR-ALC/ENFM maintains a list of all
     previously used and potential funding sources. If a need is determined to be Commer-
     cial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS), it is referred to the Capital Purchase Program or other depot expense
     funding sources.
     3.2.4. Contact the wing POC to collect information needed to describe and assess the need candi-
     date, focusing on proposed funding source(s) requirements. The information shall include metrics,
     return on investment (ROI), and success criteria for the project. Sufficient detail shall be collected
     to ensure the project is viable in the various technology programs.
     3.2.5. Check for duplicate effort against previous efforts, current programs, existing needs,
     Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC), Scientific and Technical Information Office
     (STINFO), Air Force Research Labs and the other centers for duplication of effort.
     3.2.6. Query other organizations to determine if the need also exists in other Centers or services.
     If so, coordinate with that organization on merging the requirements.
     3.2.7. Assign an initial prioritization placement of the candidate need on the Center Master List
     (CML). Ensure that need is consistent with the Center Strategic Technology Plan.
     3.2.8. Communicate to the concept originator and the wing POC with the duplicate effort check
     (paragraph 3.2.4.) and the prioritization (paragraph 3.2.5.).
     3.2.9. Work with the wing POC to draft a technology transition plan. The draft is necessary to
     begin preparing for any long-lead items required to implement the technology. These long-lead
     items could be Program Objective Memorandum/budget inputs, future floor space preparation,
     interfacing with other programs/systems, training, etc. The Technology Transition Plan (TTP) will
     also identify how the benefits of the program will be measured.
  3.3. Validate Concept: At least semi-annually, the WR-ALC/ENFM will present the CML to the
  Technology Strategy Group (TSG). The Technology Strategy Group is a chartered subpanel of the
  Engineering Advisory Board. The TSG will determine if the need is cross cutting across wings or
6                                                                ROBINSAFBI61-101 19 JULY 2007


    other organizations. The CML will depict both existing needs and the new candidate needs in the pro-
    posed priority order. The TSG will validate all needs and their prioritization.
    3.4. Approve Needs: Within one month following Technology Strategy Group validation, WR-ALC/
    ENFM will present the CML to the Engineering Advisory Board for approval of existing needs, the
    candidate needs and the prioritization. Upon approval, candidate needs will no longer be classified as
    “candidate.” Once on the CML, a technology need exits the “ID Need” step of the TIP and enters the
    “Submit and Track” step of the process (Figure 1.). Once a need is on the CML it can only be
    removed from the list when the need is funded and completed or the need is removed by the Engineer-
    ing Advisory Board as no longer being necessary. The approved CML will then be used to answer the
    various technology data calls that come into WR-ALC. If the need is not approved, a rationale shall be
    recorded and provided back to the submitter and wing POC.
    3.5. Gather Additional Information Based on Proposed Funding Source: With the Engineering
    Advisory Board approved CML, the WR-ALC/ENFM will do the following:
       3.5.1. Contact the funding source and solicit early review.
       3.5.2. Work with the wing POC and funding source to improve write-up for the specified technol-
       ogy program.
       3.5.3. At least semi-annually review all write-ups for currency, clarity and completeness.
    3.6. Submit Package: WR-ALC/ENFM is the focal point for all technology data calls. Any call
    received outside of the Technology and Reliability Branch will be forwarded to WR-ALC/EN so that
    a response can be prepared. Table 1. lists examples of data calls that will be answered using the
    approved CML. Any additions beyond what is pulled from the CML will be coordinated through the
    wings. Answering these data calls will be transparent to the wings. WR-ALC/ENFM will:
       3.6.1. Prepare and submit the package based upon the approved CML. Projects based on the CML
       require no formal coordination from the wings; however courtesy notifications will be provided to
       the Wings to allow for submission of new requirements. Any additions beyond what is pulled from
       the CML will require coordination through the sponsoring wings and WR-ALC/XP. WR-ALC/XP
       provides Center level strategic guidance and coordination with requirements and acquisition pro-
       cesses.
       3.6.2. Prepare the submission in the correct format and on-time.
       3.6.3. List submissions in priority order as approved by the Engineering Advisory Board and doc-
       umented in the CML.

    3.8. Receive Funding/Project Approval. Once funded, a technology need exits the “Submit and
    Track” phase of the TIP and enters the “Manage Projects” phase of the process (Figure 1.). WR-ALC/
    EN technology office will:
       3.8.1. Inform the WTCs, wing POC and DoE of project selection or funding authorization.
       3.8.2. Verify the program manager (PM) assigned to this program. The wing technical POC may
       act as the PM.
       3.8.3. Update the CML database to reflect technology need submittal status change.
    3.9. Prepare Program Documentation. The PM will prepare an updated transition plan. The coor-
    dinated plan will include long-lead items including POM/budget inputs, future floor space prepara-
    tion, interfacing with other programs/systems, training, etc. The TTP will also identify how the
    benefits of the program will be measured. Additional program specific documentation may also be
    required.
       3.9.1. Status chart(s). Standard quad-chart used to brief the TSG and Engineering Advisory
       Board.
       3.9.2. Other documentation as required by the funding source.
    3.10. Execute Program. Once the contract is complete, the technology need exits the “Manage
    Projects” phase of the TIP and enters the “Transition/Implementation” phase of the process (Figure
    1.). At the end of the agreed upon development period (contract period of time, funding limit, etc.),
    one of the following actions will occur:
       3.10.1. PM will execute the program following the prepared Technology Transition Plan and
       other programmatic documentation as defined by their organization.
       3.10.2. If the program yields the desired technology solution, the PM will initiate the transitioning
       of the technology in accordance with the Technology Transition Plan.
       3.10.3. If this program does not yield the desired technology solution, the wing DoE/TD will pro-
       vide further instructions on disposition of the unrealized technology need. The wing POC and
       WR-ALC/EN will jointly collect lessons learned.
       3.10.4. The PM will provide the WR-ALC/EN technology office with status chart(s) (paragraph
       3.9.4) for Engineering Advisory Board and TSG briefings (paragraph 3.3., paragraph 3.4., and
       paragraph 3.6.3.) and other program status/lesson learned as required to enter into the CML data-
       base. The WR-ALC/EN technology office will also notify the other ALCs for their information.
       3.10.5. PM will ensure all close out actions are done in accordance with the TTP and contract.
    3.11. Monitor Project Status. PM will:
       3.11.1. Track and monitor the program to ensure schedule/cost in accordance with the TTP.
       3.11.2. Provide WR-ALC/EN technology office with quarterly status chart(s) (paragraph 3.9.4.)
       for Engineering Advisory Board and TSG briefings (paragraph 3.4., paragraph 3.5., and para-
       graph 3.9.4) and other information as required to maintain the CML database.
       3.11.3. PM will attend TSG and Engineering Advisory Board briefings as required.
    3.12. Execute Technology Transition Plan. PM will finalize (coordinate) and execute the TTP in
    order to implement the technology into the day-to-day operations of the wing.
ROBINSAFBI61-101 19 JULY 2007                                                                                9


   3.13. Track Status: PM will provide quarterly status to WR-ALC/EN technology office (paragraph
   3.9.4).
       3.13.1. This may include funds status, schedule status, benefits, risk analysis, and exit criteria.
       3.13.2. The WR-ALC/EN technology office will brief the status to Engineering Advisory Board
       during quarterly reviews (paragraph 3.8.3.).
   3.14. Validate Benefits. PM will collect and verify program benefits in accordance with the TTP
   (paragraph 3.9.3) and provide them to the WR-ALC/EN technology office. The WR-ALC/EN tech-
   nology office will update the database with the program benefits. This will continue until deemed no
   longer necessary after the implementation of the technology to assure that sufficient data is collected
   to analyze the benefit. WR-ALC/EN will keep a list of projects for use in validating benefits, perform-
   ing initial screening mentioned in paragraph 3.2.5. and for metrics collection.
   3.15. Transition Complete. Once the transition/implementation of technology has been accom-
   plished according to the implementing wing as defined in the Technology Transition Plan, the technol-
   ogy need exits the “Transition/Implementation” phase of the process and completes the TIP (Figure
   1.).

any current intelligence shortfalls impacting time, cost, performance, or any other risk to the target pro-
gram, as well as any intelligence-related costs that can be assessed. Indicate whether any intelligence
requirements have been developed and submitted at this time. The fidelity of this section may vary
depending upon the maturity of the technology being transitioned and the existing requirements of the
system receiving the new technology.)
3. Transition Bridge Strategy (Suggested length is one page. Describe the plan for integrating the tech-
nology development program with the target acquisition strategy so that it maximizes the potential for the
technology to be included in the resulting target weapon system or process. A number of times in the past,
the laboratory program has reached conclusion without the weapon system or maintenance activity pick-
ing up the technology. These failures to transition may possibly occur because of a lack of business strat-
egy enabling the acceptance of the technology to be included in the weapon system or process. Up front
planning is essential to maximize the potential for transition of the technology into target weapon systems
and processes. Approaches to ensuring a successful bridge may include establishing associate contractor
agreements, awarding multiple development or transition contracts to enhance the probability of a con-
tractor becoming a subcontractor to a prime contractor, or developing a technology development approach
that includes prime contractor subcontracting to the best (competition) technology development contrac-
tor for developing the technology. Another common issue is lack of funding during the time gap after
technology development and prior to the availability of funds from the POM process. A possible strategy
to overcome this funding gap is to compete for other sources of funding such as OSD-sponsored Technol-
ogy Transition Initiative (TTI), Quick Reaction Funds (QRF), and AF Warfighter Rapid Acquisition Pro-
gram (WRAP).)
