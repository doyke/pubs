 READINESS AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT (R&EM) FLIGHT STRUCTURE
                AND EM SECTION RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Purpose. The AF must have an Emergency Management (EM) capability to be employed
alone or as part of an AF, Joint, Interagency, or Coalition force, to support Combatant
Commanders and AF objectives. This manual primarily focuses on guidance and procedures for
the EM Section of the R&EM Flight to manage and execute the installation EM program.
1.2. Structure.
   1.2.1. The active duty R&EM Flight (Figure 1.1) supports the Base Civil Engineer (BCE)
   by managing both the Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) program and the EM
   program. Some R&EM Flights will have reserve Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMA)
   positions assigned to the flight. Careful, deliberate planning and forecasting is needed to
   properly utilize assigned IMAs.

Figure 1.1. Readiness & Emergency Management Flight Structure.




Note: Civilian-based (civilian and contractor) R&EM Flights are “offices” and may not have an
Expeditionary Engineering Section. MAJCOM Civil Engineers will determine the best structure
for the civilianized flights.
   1.2.2. The Expeditionary Engineering Section. The Expeditionary Engineering Section
   sustains unit readiness through organization, training and equipping of unit personnel to
   accomplish contingency operations.
   1.2.3. The EM Section supports the cross-functional EM program integrating preparedness,
   response, recovery, and mitigation activities in an all-hazards physical threat environment to
   help commanders maintain and restore mission capability. The EM Section has a planning
   and management as well as an emergency response component within the Air Force Incident
   Management System (AFIMS).
   1.2.4. Reserve flights on active duty installations are postured with one to two full-time
   positions that are Air Reserve Technicians (ART). The ARTs manage the requirements
 8                                                                AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013


     needed for the monthly unit training assembly and are responsible for coordination with the
     host for all host tenant support required according to AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency
     Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations.
        1.2.4.1. The flight also has traditional reservists that are postured according to the
        4FPW-series unit type codes (UTCs) assigned and UTC skill level requirements.
        1.2.4.2. Reserve personnel primary duty is to train to meet the mission capability
        statement requirements.
1.3. EM Missions. As stated in AFI 10-2501, the primary missions of the AF EM program are
to save lives; minimize the loss or degradation of resources; and continue, sustain, and restore
operational capability in an all-hazards physical threat environment at AF installations
worldwide. The R&EM Flight leadership ensures processes are in place to accomplish these
missions by transforming the Commander’s priorities and expectations into actions that
complement core EM mission sets. These EM missions are Planning, Preparedness and EM
Operations:
     1.3.1. Planning. Effective emergency management relies on thorough integration of
     emergency plans at all levels of the organization. Emergency Management facilitates the
     development of the installation emergency management plan, focuses on resource and risk
     management planning, and has situational awareness of all other contingency plans on the
     installation.
     1.3.2. Preparedness. Department of Defense Instruction (DODI) 6055.17, DOD
     Installation Emergency Management identifies the following as preparedness activities: risk
     management; establishing interim and long-term actions to reduce and/or eliminate identified
     hazards and/or threats to the installation; establishing interim and long-term actions to reduce
     the impact of hazards and/or threats that cannot be eliminated; training; exercises;
     interagency coordination; and equipping response forces. Specifically, preparedness activities
     need to include training and education, and exercises, personnel qualifications, equipment
     certification, and the integration of planning and procedures.
     1.3.3. Operations. This involves providing direct support to the Incident Commander (IC)
     and/or Recovery Operations Chief during natural events, human-caused events (accidental
     and intentional) or technologically caused events. EM operations primarily involve providing
     support in the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and
     Nuclear (CBRN) Control Center, Unit Control Center (UCC) or on-scene as required. During
     CBRN responses, support and integration into the Incident Command System (ICS) involves
     more tactical operations such as specialized detection and contamination control support.
1.4. EM Section Responsibilities. The EM Section, under the host organization BCE, is the
single focal point for the EM program on the installation and considered the installation
commander’s office of primary responsibility (OPR) for EM program execution. It is comparable
to off-base Office of Emergency Management (OEM) counterparts. As such, they will execute
the installation EM program through the establishment of core EM mission sets. A tenant Air
Reserve Component (ARC) R&EM Flight is not responsible for installation program
management. For Joint-Base installations where the sister service owns the EM program, Air
Force EM Sections are the key EM representative for the senior AF authority and will perform
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                       9


duties necessary to properly train and educate Airmen on AF specific requirements (e.g., CBRN
passive defense, etc.). The EM Section will:
   1.4.1. Employ ways to gain the greatest value from manpower and financial resources used
   to execute the installation EM program. Ensure program responsibilities are consistent with
   commander’s mission priorities.
   1.4.2. Analyze and recommend changes in equipment maintenance, training, administrative,
   tactics, techniques, procedures and concepts of operation to improve the effectiveness of
   existing capabilities. Up-channel recommended changes to the Major Command
   (MAJCOM).
   1.4.3. Meet all training and equipment requirements to respond to incidents using AFIMS as
   defined in AFMAN 10-2502, Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS) Standards
   and Procedures.
1.5. Expeditionary Engineering Section Responsibilities. The Expeditionary Engineering
Section will:
   1.5.1. Ensure the resources and training required to undertake a unit's wartime mission(s) are
   consistent with tasked Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement and unit
   commander's priorities.
   1.5.2. Accomplish program requirements in accordance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-
   210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) Program, and Air Force Pamphlet
   (AFPAM) 10-219, Volume 8, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) Management.
1.6. Flight Leadership Responsibilities. Senior EM Flight personnel report to the BCE or
equivalent and, as it relates to the EM program, will:
   1.6.1. Serve as the installation Emergency Manager. Send a copy of this appointment to the
   local OEM.
   1.6.2. Serve as the EOC Manager. This should be able to support 24/7 operations.
   1.6.3. Develop localized guidance as needed expanding upon the requirements in AFI 10-
   2501. This guidance can take various forms such as an AFI supplement, base instruction, or
   included in the Basic Plan within the Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2,
   etc.
   1.6.4. Assist commanders and functional area supervisors with developing and maintaining
   plans, policies and programs supporting EM program objectives. Coordinate installation EM
   support with MAJCOM A7 Emergency Management Functional Staffs.
   1.6.5. Manage CBRN passive defense and consequence management activities using
   AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-
   Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Environment, AFI 10-2501, and applicable AF Tactics,
   Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTPs).
   1.6.6. Coordinate local EM policies and procedures with local civilian EM counterparts.
   MAJCOMs will determine Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) requirements.
10                                                           AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013


  1.6.7. Facilitate installation Emergency Management Working Group (EMWG) meetings
  according to AFI 10-2501. This includes taking detailed minutes and tracking open items
  identified by the EMWG until closed.
  1.6.8. Represent as CBRN and EM subject matter experts on installation working groups
  such as the Threat Working Group, Anti-terrorism Working Group and other installation
  working groups.
  1.6.9. Brief installation, group, unit commanders, ARC R&EM Flight Superintendents, Air
  Reserve Technicians, and senior leaders on EM policies and commanders’ EM
  responsibilities. Provide commanders EM expertise to assist them as they budget for, equip,
  and organize their unit Disaster Response Force (DRF) components.
     1.6.9.1. Customize unit briefings based on the mission and responsibilities of each
     particular commander. General and specific unit responsibilities can be found in AFI 10-
     2501.
     1.6.9.2. Emphasize partnerships while orienting commanders by explaining not only
     what EM can do for a unit but what the unit needs to do to ensure preparedness and
     readiness.
  1.6.10. Ensure completion of the EM program’s vulnerability, risk and capabilities
  assessment. Develop work-arounds for identified EM gaps. Consider Mutual Aid
  Agreements (MAAs), Memorandums of Agreements (MOAs) and Memorandums of
  Understanding (MOUs) with surrounding R&EM Flights, Guard/Reserve units, and/or off-
  base capabilities. Ensure these efforts complement the development of the IEMP 10-2.
  1.6.11. To successfully execute the R&EM Flight financial management responsibilities,
  Flight leadership must work closely with the Civil Engineer (CE) squadron Resource Advisor
  (RA), functional area managers and the EMWG to develop, coordinate and execute a
  coordinated budget with available funding.
  1.6.12. Staff additional appointments as required. Implementing the installation EM program
  is a priority. Figure 1.2, illustrates key duties governed by other AF programs that support
  execution of the EM program and are typically required:
  1.6.12.1. Develop a flight safety program according to Chapter 2 and requirements outlined
  by the unit and wing safety program.
  1.6.13. Ensure training classes are provided to support the installation EM program
  according to AFI 10-2501.
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                      11


Figure 1.2. Typical EM Duties.




   1.6.14. Establish an on-the-job training (OJT) program according to guidance provided by
   the Unit Training Manager and current procedures.
      1.6.14.1. Develop a master task listing according to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training
      Program for upgrade training and position qualification.
      1.6.14.2. Ensure all EM personnel are trained, exercised and qualified to proper skill-
      level standards and requirements listed in the Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) 3E9X1
      Emergency Management Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) through a
      comprehensive in-house training program. Incorporate drills and functional exercises into
      the in-house training program.
      1.6.14.3. Forecast formal and specialty training requirements according to Chapter 3.
      1.6.14.4. Evaluate EM instructor fundamentals semi-annually using the Air Education
      and Training Command (AETC) Form 281, Instructor Evaluation Form. Provide follow-
      up on instructor fundamental deficiencies as required. ARC EM instructors must be
      evaluated at least annually.
   1.6.15. Equip EM Section response forces for EM operations according to Chapter 4.
   1.6.16. Provide installation EM planning according to Chapter 5.
   1.6.17. Ensure Flight information management duties are accomplished according to
   Chapter 6.
   1.6.18. Advocate for Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) capability and

   as well as the EOC.
 12                                                            AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013


   1.6.19. Ensure unit EM programs are managed according to Chapter 7.
   1.6.20. Develop, manage, and execute the R&EM Flight budget according to Chapter 8.
   1.6.21. Implement the installation EM Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) Program.
   1.6.22. Supervise an annual self-inspection using checklists and procedures provided by the
   parent MAJCOM according to Chapter 9.
       1.6.22.1. If MAJCOM assistance is requested, the request must come from the unit
       commander.
       1.6.22.2. Coordinate, prepare for, budget, and host the MAJCOM EM SAV according to
       AFI 90-201, Air Force Inspection System, and MAJCOM guidance.
   1.6.23. Provide support to the installation Wing Inspection Team (WIT). This includes
   maintaining a close partnership with the exercise office and offering subject matter expertise
   in EM program training and exercise scenario development.
   1.6.24. Develop and document processes for managing the R&EM Flight and supporting the
   installation EM program. Operating instructions, checklists, flight operating guides, or
   standard operating procedures are all acceptable tools to develop these procedures. Review
   AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for specific guidance on operating
   instructions. Document a review of these processes at least annually. Chapter 6, provides a
   recommended list of EM Section processes.
   1.6.25. Develop an installation “Be Ready” awareness campaign.
1.7. Manning. The R&EM Flight is typically led by a Company Grade Officer or Senior
Civilian. Ideally, the EM Section follows the enlisted force structure with junior Airman, Non-
Commissioned Officers and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers. This will vary in civilian and
contracted flights. However, actual assigned personnel often do not match authorizations.
Manning shortfalls require leadership to prioritize work assignments.
   1.7.1. If the installation has an established augmentation duty program as outlined in
   AFPAM 10-243, Augmentation Duty, determine the manpower requirements for, size, and
   scope of the installation Emergency Management Support Team (EMST). Base requirements
   for EMST on difference between available EM forces and requirements needed to meet the
   mission specific to the location. OCONUS locations may have to increase their EMST
   requirements based on the wartime requirement as driven by the threat. When the installation
   does not have a structured augmentation program in place, use the EMWG as the vehicle to
   properly identify requirements and specify who will provide the manpower.
1.8. Air Force Certified Emergency Manager (AFCEM) Program. This program
professionalizes the career field and allows members in the AF Emergency Management
community to be awarded one of the three levels of accreditation: Air Force Certified All
Hazards Responder (AFCAHR), Air Force Certified Associate Emergency Manager
(AFCAEM), or Air Force Certified Emergency Manager (AFCEM).
   1.8.1. The AFCEM program is completely voluntary but highly recommended.
   1.8.2. This Program is closely aligned with the International Association of Emergency
   Managers (IAEM) Certified Emergency Manager (CEM) and Associate Emergency Manager
   (AEM) process. Completion of the AFCEM program does not constitute complete reciprocity
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                         13


   credit with the IAEM. However, many of the accomplishments required to obtain an AFCEM
   or AFCAEM will provide a large portion of the requirements for award of the CEM and
   AEM.
   1.8.3. In order to apply to this program, the applicant must be a 3E9X1 Emergency Manager,
   Readiness Flight Officer, government civilian or Air Force contractor working in the R&EM
   Flight, Air Force Emergency Management Instructors, Emergency Management Functional
   at MAJCOM, Direct Reporting Unit (DRU), Forward Operating Agency, or working in an
   EM position on Inspector General Staffs.
   1.8.4. The process of being certified is based on the individual’s Air Force skill-level,
   education, experience and professional contributions.
   1.8.5. The AFCEM program application package can be obtained electronically on the
   Readiness and Emergency Management Flight Community of Practice (CoP).
      1.8.5.1. The package will be submitted electronically to the appropriate approving

                       INTELLIGENCE, SECURITY, AND SAFETY

Section 2A—Intelligence

2.1. Objectives. EM operations require an understanding and implementation of sound
intelligence, security, and safety practices.
2.2. Intelligence Requirements.
   2.2.1. Homeland Defense (home-station) Assessments. Participate in core Homeland
   Defense planning groups. (e.g., Force Protection Working Group, Threat Working Group,
   etc).
   2.2.2. Research specific DOC tasking locations and maintain a file on each site. Much of the
   information may be found if the deployed location has an expeditionary site plan. AFI 10-
   404, Base Support and Expeditionary (BAS&E) Site Planning, Attachment 13, CBRN
   Defense Operations provides specific guidance. As a minimum, consider the following:
   mission and threat assessments, maps, host nation EM or CBRN capabilities, facility plans
   and point of contact.
   2.2.3. For information not available through the aforementioned, initiate a Request For
   Information (RFI) to the local intelligence squadron. RFIs should be specific, outline the
   need for the information and are most often classified.
   2.2.4. Access to intelligence information requires access to SIPRNET and proper clearance.

Section 2B—Security

2.3. Physical Security Requirements.
   2.3.1. Protecting information is critical to mission accomplishment. The R&EM Flight
   typically maintains classified or sensitive information necessary for the flight or CE
   Squadron to manage the EM and Prime BEEF programs as well as CBRN defense activities.
   2.3.2. All flight personnel should be familiar with AFI 31-401, Information Security
   Program Management, specifically as it pertains to handling, storing, generating or
   transporting classified information.
   2.3.3. Most R&EM Flights maintain classified containers for the unit and, as such, may have
   to grant access to the safe to other unit personnel outside the flight. According to AFI 31-401,
   personnel who have authorized possession, knowledge, or control of classified information
   grant individuals access to classified information when required for mission essential needs
   and when the individual has the appropriate clearance and has a need to know the
   information.

Section 2C—Safety Programs

2.4. Ground Safety Programs. R&EM Flights may be required to participate in, and therefore
should be familiar with, the following health and safety programs. Document training on AF
 16                                                            AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013


Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record, for every flight member as prescribed by AFI 91-
302, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection and Health (AFOSH)
Standards.
   2.4.1. Environmental Management System, Hazardous Communications.
   2.4.2. Respiratory Protection Program. Bioenvironmental Engineers (BEE) are responsible
   for the Respiratory Protection Program as outlined in Air Force Occupational Safety and
   Health Standard (AFOSHSTD) 48-137, Respiratory Protection Program.
   2.4.3. Blood Borne Pathogen Program.
   2.4.4. Laser Safety. Ensure all flight personnel that operate, maintain and store the First
   Defender Spectrometer are trained annually using material provided by the Base
   Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE) Flight/Base Laser Safety Officer (LSO).
2.5. Job Safety Analysis (JSA). The JSA is well suited to identify the hazards associated with
some EM operations to include the CBRN Defense Survival Skills Course and active CBRN
response. Supervisors’ duties and responsibilities should include identifying hazards associated
with tasks and:
   2.5.1. Knowing the safety and occupational health standards that apply to EM areas.
   2.5.2. Analyzing the job environment and tasks for hazards through proper operational risk
   management techniques.
   2.5.3. Developing job safety standards or training outlines for assigned work areas and train
   personnel on standards to follow and hazards to avoid.
   2.5.4. Taking appropriate actions to promptly mitigate safety and health hazards and correct
   deficiencies.
   2.5.5. Using a JSA can reduce workplace injuries by reducing each job to its fundamental
   steps, then identifying the hazards associated with each of those steps, and finally,
   developing solutions to control those hazards. Once the JSA is completed, it serves the
   additional benefit of providing a training tool to new employees so that they are aware of the
   hazards and controls.
2.6. Personal Safety Responsibilities. Individuals have the responsibility to support a safe
workplace to include:
   2.6.1. Complying with personal protective equipment requirements that apply to the work
   situation, including its use, inspection, and care.
   2.6.2. Giving due consideration to personal safety and the safety of fellow workers while
   doing assigned tasks.
2.7. Additional Intelligence, Security, and Safety Resources: are available in Table 2.1.

Notes:
1. Augmentation means using people in other than their assigned Control Air Force Specialty
Code duties. After BCEs exhaust their military personnel resource pool, recommend they look
within their organization to see if there are skilled and/or trained Department of the Air Force
(DAF) civilian members who can perform the duty prior to seeking assistance from other
organizations through the ARB.
2. Consider local needs and conditions when determining augmentation requirements.
Augmentation requirements are used primarily to support temporary, short-term workload surges
during wartime, contingency, natural disaster, and exercise situations.
3. Units using augmentees decide augmentee duties and train the augmentees to perform those
duties. The augmented unit tracks all required training.
4. Augmented units should fund for required training, necessary equipment, uniform items (rain
gear, cold weather gear, etc.), and safety gear (steel toed boots, leatherwork gloves, reflective
belts, etc.).
5. Before DAF civilian employees are used for augmentation duties all legal, regulatory and
bargaining agreement stipulations should be followed closely.
6. Collocated ARC units may be utilized to fill known augmentee requirements. Close
coordination and scheduling with the ARC units is required to ensure availability of personnel
and funding to meet the augmentation needs.
7. All 3E9X1 personnel are classified as emergency responders and should not be assigned to
any type of augmentee duties that will conflict with their emergency response duties.
   3.3.4. Establish local logistics requirements, budget, and procure equipment specific to the
   EMST mission for EMST personnel responding to incidents.
   3.3.5. EMST tasks may include, but are not limited to: CCS, ESF-5, CBRN Control Center,
   incident command post operations, EOC administration, and other EM support duties.

Section 3B—EM Training

3.4. IEM Training and Education Objectives. EM courses provide installation personnel with
the required knowledge and skills to, prepare for, respond to, and recover from incidents
requiring AF response. The EM Training Element will:
   3.4.1. Coordinate installation EM training according to AFI 10-2501. All EM instructors
   must be task certified in a course before they can teach it. Use AF Form 1098, Special Task
   Certification and Recurring Training, as prescribed by AFI 36-2201, to document task
   certification.
   3.4.2. Develop a training schedule and post it on the Automated CE System – Personnel
   Readiness (ACES-PR) Unit Scheduler Module for units to view and use to schedule classes.
22                                                            AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013


  Consider scheduling a majority of CBRN Defense Survival Skills classes within the Air and
  Space Expeditionary Force (AEF) training windows. Account for variances related to
  exercises, leaves, other Temporary Duty (TDYs) and deployments in order to cover your
  minimum requirements.
  3.4.3. Determine requirements for training, such as training sites, facilities, classroom
  furniture, audio-visual equipment, supplies, and student materials.
  3.4.4. Determine the minimum class size for all EM courses the flight instructs. Publish
  minimum class sizes and any “no show” policies approved by the installation EMWG in
  local guidance. Typically, a recommended class size for CBRN Defense Survival Skills will
  be 10-15 students. The number of classes required will depend upon many factors, such as
  the number of specialized team members assigned and the turnover rate of the team
  members.
  3.4.5. Develop an instructor schedule for all EM installation training. Consider
  implementing instructor-to-student ratios of one instructor for every 30 students. The
  exception is the CBRN Defense Survival Skills which requires one instructor for every 15
  students. Table 3.3, Example Training Forecast Matrix provides an example of a matrix for
  determine training workloads.
     3.4.5.1. Coordinate the installation training schedule through the EM elements, and gain
     approval through R&EM Flight leadership prior to publicizing.
     3.4.5.2. All assigned EM personnel must teach at least one class a quarter to maintain
     instructor proficiency. This may include a lesson during in-house training (IHT). ARC
     EM instructors must teach at least one class per year.
  3.4.6. Develop and maintain master lesson plans for instructor-led courses utilizing available
  instructor guides created by AFCEC/CXR. Tailor lesson plans to local conditions. Review
  and update lesson plans annually or when guidance, such as publications or Technical Orders
  (TO), changes. Use AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook For Air Force Instructors, for any locally
  developed courses. Use multi-media and educational handouts to support training. Develop
  products if AFCEC training tools do not exist for the subject being taught.
  3.4.7. Maintain and publish training statistics for all courses conducted. Provide trend
  analysis on unit scheduling, attendance rates, and classroom utilization rates to the EMWG
  and higher headquarters as required by MAJCOM direction.
  3.4.8. When the situation changes, just-in-time training (e.g. Contamination Control Team
  (CCT), or Shelter Management Team (SMT)) will require re-prioritizing existing workload
  in order to get all specialized teams scheduled and trained.

Notes:
1. Minimum scheduling frequency required regardless of students requiring training. (For
example, the Base Emergency Preparedness Orientation (BEPO), is scheduled every third
Thursday without knowing how many students are required or will show.)
2. Recurring training frequency. (For example, local procedures may dictate UCC members be
trained quarterly and EMST members be trained monthly.) These frequencies are only examples.
3. M = Monthly, Q = Quarterly, A = Annually, N/A = Not Applicable
   3.4.9. Update the ACES-PR database with training conducted. Document completion of Air
   Force EM education and training utilizing AF Form 4450, Emergency Management Training
   Report.
   3.4.10. Use the procedures in Attachment 2, Mask Confidence Training, if mask confidence
   training is incorporated into the local CBRN defense skills training.
   3.4.11. Supplement the CE Operations Flight Facility Manager’s Training with EM
   information, such as shelter-in-place procedures.
   3.4.12. Tailor the BEPO training only to the threats and unique requirements of the
   installation. De-conflict topics that may be covered by Fire Emergency Services (FES), Anti-
   terrorism or the Wing Safety office.
3.5. In-House Training (IHT). A well planned training program will assist with the career
progression from Responder to Emergency Manager. IHT procedures are defined in Attachment
3.
3.6. Emergency Management Career Progression. The CFETP 32EX for officers and 3E9X1
for enlisted provide a comprehensive education and training document identifying life-cycle
education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum requirements for

an Air Force specialty. Civilians occupying associated positions should use Part II of the 3E9X1
CFETP as a guide to support duty position qualification training.
   3.6.1. EM Trainers and Task Certifiers. Ensure trainers are recommended by their
   supervisor, qualified to perform the task being trained, and have completed the Air Force
   Training Course. AFI 36-2201 lists task certifier qualifications and responsibilities.
   3.6.2. EM Proficiency Documentation. Use AF Form 1098, (or electronic equivalent), to
   list Air Force, MAJCOM-specific, and installation-specific EM Proficiency training
   requirements and to document training. This form may be overprinted and filed in the AF
   Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, as prescribed by AFI 36-2201. The Air Force
   Civil Engineer has mandated the use of the Air Force Training Record (AFTR), which is the
   enlisted OJT record system for personnel in upgrade training.
   3.6.3. EM Flight Formal Training Courses. EM personnel attend several formal courses
   throughout their careers. Forecast course requirements with the unit training manager,
   government contracting officer (for contracted personnel) and MAJCOM. Maintain a list of
   flight personnel who require training to fill allocations effectively. Monitor AF Incident
   Management Course requirements for all installation target audience members listed in AFI
   10-2501 to properly balance personnel requiring training. Track these personnel who have
   the training to ensure appropriate forecasting for future classes. See Table 3.4, for a list of
   courses in addition to those required by AFI 10-2501. Also, 3E9X1 CFETP lists training
   courses and resources applicable to the EM career field.
3.7. Prime BEEF Training. Prime BEEF training is managed and documented according to

                                       LOGISTICS

4.1. General. This chapter provides the EM Logistics equipment management information. The
specific equipment inventory will vary depending on the installation’s mission, location,
functions, size, and specific threat. AFCEC and MAJCOMs ensure baseline and supplemental
equipment requirements and guidance are provided to the installation R&EM Flight to support
incident response and training.
4.2. Equipment Inventory Process. Effective inventory management is key to logistics. For
fiscal responsibility, efficiency and preparedness in a crisis it is important to know what
equipment is available, what equipment is needed and ensure all equipment is in operational
order. A simple inventory management process includes four basic steps: determining
requirements; accounting for equipment on-hand; maintaining the equipment available; and
actively addressing the shortfalls and overages. The process is shown in Figure 4.1

Figure 4.1. Sample Flight Equipment Inventory Management Process.




   4.2.1. Identify Requirements.
      4.2.1.1. Know what equipment is needed to meet the mission. Know what equipment is
      on the UTCs and how it’s used to meet the mission. Identify equipment items needed to
      support the home station mission, including IEMP 10-2 contingency operations,
      classroom training, “Be Ready” campaign materials, installation CBRN response
      equipment, weapons and munitions, warehouse equipment, war reserve material,
      administrative supplies, communications equipment for both office and response use, and
      exercise support equipment.
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                      27


     4.2.1.2. Look at each mission set listed throughout this manual and determine the
     equipment needed to accomplish each activity.
     4.2.1.3. Integrate logistics processes between the Emergency Management Section and
     Expeditionary Engineering Section to gain efficiencies and eliminate redundancies.
  4.2.2. Inventory On Hand Items.
     4.2.2.1. Establish accountability for all UTC and high-value non-UTC assets to include:
     commercial off the shelf (COTS) items, non-UTC equipment valued over $1000 and any
     other assets requiring recurring maintenance and sustainment by the R&EM Flight. Use
     the Barcode Inventory Tracking System (BITS) to maintain this accountability/inventory.
     4.2.2.2. Establish an inventory schedule. Identify and properly manage shelf life items in
     according to DOD 4140-27M, Shelf Life Item Management Manual.
  4.2.3. Maintain Equipment and Supplies.
     4.2.3.1. Maintain equipment and supplies according to TOs or applicable guidance or
     MAJCOM guidance. Determine equipment required for local response and maintain that
     equipment in an operationally ready status. Ready status is defined as equipment that
     must be used for response at a moment’s notice.
     4.2.3.2. Label individual protective equipment (IPE) that is maintained in the flight for
     training use only according to the applicable equipment TO. Store “Training Only”
     equipment separately from operational or dual-purpose equipment.
     4.2.3.3. Identify items in the inventory that require periodic inspections and calibrations.
     Establish a flight inspection and calibration program according to T.O. 00-20-14, Air
     Force Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) Program. Stagger equipment calibration
     dates so sufficient assets are available for immediate response. Plan for lead times and
     backlogs. Use Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 244, Industrial/Support
     Equipment Record to maintain records of inspections.
     4.2.3.4. Joint Deficiency Reporting System (JDRS). JDRS is a cross-service web
     enabled automated tracking system designed to initiate, process and track equipment
     deficiency reports from the Warfighter through the investigation process. If a flight
     receives a defective or deficient piece of equipment through the federal acquisition
     system, they should log on to www.JDRS.mil and initiate a deficiency report.
     4.2.3.5. Joint Acquisition Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear (CBRN)
     Knowledge System (JACKS). JACKS is a web-based DOD knowledge management
     system for information related to the acquisition and support of CBRN defense products.
     JACKS provides detailed search capability to include: CBRN equipment specifications
     and standards; equipment fact sheets; shelf life information; advisory messages; new
     equipment training; and contact information.
     4.2.3.6. Review EM-related allowance standards and equipment supply listings (ESL)
     regularly to determine if authorizations for accountable equipment items have been
     added, deleted, or changed. The primary EM-related allowance standards 459 and 016
     can be located at https://earms2.wpafb.af.mil/sites/asrs/home.asp.

       4.2.3.7. Coordinate with the Operations Element to prepare checklists for equipment
       after equipment is received. Checklists should tell how, where, and by whom equipment
       will be used, especially CBRN detection, identification, and monitoring equipment.
       4.2.3.8. Update Automated Civil Engineers System – Resources Module (ACES-RM) to
       provide Status of Resources and Training System reportable and Air and Space
       Expeditionary Force Reporting Tool reportable equipment statistics to the unit Prime
       BEEF Program Manager for reporting.
   4.2.4. Address the “Delta”. Determine the difference between the requirements and the
   inventory. The result is the delta, which may be shortages or overages.
       4.2.4.1. Identify shortages to flight leadership for funding. Update shortages in ACES-
       RM.
       4.2.4.2. For equipment overages, contact MAJCOM for disposition instructions. Dispose
       of non-CBRN overages through re-distribution to other units, turn-in to Logistics
       Readiness Squadron or turn-in to Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services.
4.3. EM Personnel Response Bags. EM personnel may be required to respond to the scene of a
major accident or other incidents with little or no notice. Responding could place EM technicians
in austere environments with minimum time to transition from working in a climate-controlled
office to responding outside during in-hospitable conditions. Therefore, personnel must maintain
a response bag at the office. Table 4.1, provides a recommended list of items for EM and EMST
personnel. Further develop the personnel response bag inventory locally based on environments,
hazards and missions.

Table 4.1. Recommended EM Personnel Response Bags.
Recommended Items
                                                   Sunscreen

Mess kit, Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) - 3 day supply (see note below)
Note: Common items such as MREs, water, sleeping bags and mats do not have to be
maintained at the flight at all times. However, the flight must pre-coordinate a plan to ensure
these items can be obtained and issued quickly to flight personnel. The R&EM Flight Chief or
Superintendent will determine when these items will be obtained and issued.
4.4. Response Vehicles and Trailers. Perform and document emergency response
vehicles/trailers inspections and operations checks according to the Flight’s established
standards. Table 4.2, outlines the maximum trailer requirements for the transport of the 4F9WM
UTC equipment package. Existing trailers exceeding these requirements can be used, with an

   4.4.1. Emergency Response Vehicle inspections should be conducted daily and documented
   on AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report. Flight leadership will
   determine minimum operations checks on other non-registered support vehicles such as all-
   terrain vehicles unless already directed by MAJCOM. Additionally, check equipment such as
   trailers, generators, communication equipment, and weather monitoring equipment.
   Contracted flights should develop a similar process to ensure safe and rapid response.
   4.4.2. Each R&EM flight should designate a general purpose vehicle for emergency
   response. As such, the vehicle should be clearly identified with appropriate lights and decals
   on the vehicle. Emergency lighting typically serves the following purposes: clear the right of
   way or warn of potential hazards. Contact the installation Security Forces (SF) squadron for
   specific rules/regulations guiding the use of emergency vehicle lighting.
4.5. Interagency Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Database of
Responsibilities, Authorities, and Capabilities (INDRAC). Maintain Civil Engineer
Emergency Management data in the INDRAC website indrac.dtra.mil or indrac.dtra.smil.mil.
   4.5.1. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) Strategic Command Center (SCC)
   maintains the INDRAC website. The website maintains a list of specialized United States
   (U.S.) CBRN response capabilities and provides the Combating Weapons of Mass
   Destruction (CWMD) community a web-based strategic level reference resource for
   understanding CWMD roles, authorities, and capabilities of the DOD and other U.S.
   Government departments and agencies.
   4.5.2. Commanders maintain the list of specialized U.S. nuclear weapon incident and other
   nuclear and radiological incident non-counterterrorism response capabilities on the INDRAC
   website.
   4.5.3. For Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) for domestic consequence
   management operations in response to a CBRN incident, the DTRA/SCC-WMD operates and
   maintains the listing of all DOD CBRN consequence management assets capable of
   supporting operations within the INDRAC System.

                                           PLANNING

5.1. Planning Objectives, Roles, and Responsibilities.
   5.1.1. Planning Objectives. EM planning for the protection of personnel encompasses all
   military, DOD, and host nation civilians, contractors, dependents, and guests including those
   geographically separated units (GSU) and off base facilities supported by the installation.
   Planning also addresses resources and activities for installation units to prepare for, respond
   to, and recover from the threats and hazards specific to the installation. This also includes
   special events such as air shows, distinguished visitors, and installation ceremonies.
   5.1.2. Roles and Responsibilities:
       5.1.2.1. R&EM typically serves as the CE plans representative. The BCE will make this
       decision.
       5.1.2.2. The EM Planning Element will serve as the OPR for CBRN passive defense and
       consequence management planning. Ensure this process involves all stakeholders on the
       installation. Table 5.1, provides a list, not all inclusive, of typical installation plans of
       interest to the EM program:

       5.1.2.4. Use the IEMP 10-2 template available on the CoP to develop the IEMP 10-2.
       Expand, modify and tailor the template to meet the specific or unique circumstances at
       each installation or deployment location.

      5.1.2.5. Review the IEMP 10-2 every two years. Review the plan before the review date
      if there has been a significant mission change or change to the threats affecting the base.
      (e.g. a new nuclear power plant was built in the community.) Update when significant
      changes occur in installation response policies and capabilities. The review should be
      documented on the “Security Instructions and Record of Changes” page.
      5.1.2.6. Provide functional checklist templates from the IEMP 10-2 to installation units.
      5.1.2.7. Review and coordinate other installation units’ EM-related plans and checklists.
      Unit reviews must include all assigned, attached, and tenant units, including ARC units,
      located on and off the installation. Develop and implement a method to track the review
      and approval of emergency response plans and checklists that support IEMP 10-2. Use a
      tracking method (electronic or paper copy) such as the example in Table 5.3

      5.1.2.8. Conduct the CBRN and EM portions of the installation risk management process
      according to AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiterrorism (AT) Standards, AFI 10-2501, and
      supporting manuals.
      5.1.2.9. Support the CE Engineering Flight (Environmental Section) in developing the
      chemical warfare agent section of the hazardous waste collection and disposal plan
      according to AFMAN 10-2503.
      5.1.2.10. Review and coordinate on EM-related MAAs, MOAs, and MOUs. Integrate
      joint service, MAA, and host tenant support agreements into the installation EM program.
      5.1.2.11. Coordinate with first responders and local civilian authorities to ensure the
      DRF uses standardized off-base maps with the same off-base grid and Military Grid
      Reference System.
5.2. Effective Emergency Management Planning.
   5.2.1. An effective planning process will:
      5.2.1.1. Address all incidents likely to affect the installation, including recurring and/or
      planned special events. Planning covers all aspects of emergency preparedness, response,
      recovery and address mitigation concerns as well.
      5.2.1.2. Integrate all response agencies and entities into a single, seamless system, from
      the Incident Command Post, through EOCs and UCCs. Utilize an all-hazards approach
      and be flexible enough to apply in all emergencies—even unforeseen events.
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                      33


       5.2.1.3. Be risk-based.
       5.2.1.4. Address a public information system.
       5.2.1.5. Identify and type resources according to established standards.
       5.2.1.6. Determine all personnel requiring training for the job(s) they perform.
       5.2.1.7. Emphasize communications interoperability and redundancy.
       5.2.1.8. Integrate decision points at critical junctions to ensure commander’s intent and
       priorities are met.
   5.2.2. Emergency planning is not a one-time event. Rather, it is a continual cycle of
   planning, training, exercising, and revision that takes place throughout the phases of the
   emergency management cycle.
5.3. All-Hazards Approach. EM planning should focus on an all-hazards approach applicable
to the threats at the installation identified through a comprehensive risk assessment. This
approach encompasses terrorist attacks, major disasters, and all other emergencies natural or
man-made, including those defined in DODI 6055.17, that warrant action to protect the life,
property, health, and safety of military members, dependents, civilians at risk, and minimize any
disruptions of installation operations. All-hazards planning focuses on developing capabilities
critical to preparedness for a full spectrum of emergencies or disasters.
   5.3.1. All-hazards planning identifies many actions and processes that must be taken in an
   emergency, and develops a generalized framework to respond regardless of the emergency
   (e.g., whether an ice storm or hurricane occurs, the hospital still needs supplies).
   5.3.2. This approach recognizes that all emergencies cause similar problems and that many
   response actions to emergencies are generic (power outages, casualty management,
   command/control, etc.). There is also a recognition that one emergency may cause others. At
   the same time, the approach recognizes that many risks require specific prevention, response
   and recovery measures.
5.4. Emergency Planning Process. Emergency Managers should use a planning approach
consistent with processes already familiar to most planners. When the planning process is used
consistently during the preparedness phase, its use during operations becomes second nature.
Figure 5.1, depicts steps in the planning process. At each step in the planning process, EM
planners should consider the impact of the decisions made on training, exercises, equipment and
other requirements.

Figure 5.1. Planning Process.




   5.4.1. Step 1. Form a collaborative planning team. Operational planning is best performed
   by a team. Using a team or group approach helps organizations define the role they will play
   during an operation.
      5.4.1.1. Consider establishing a core team consisting of planners from the following
      units:
          5.4.1.1.1. First and Emergency Responders (Fire Emergency Services (FES),
          Security Forces Squadron (SFS), Medical Group (MDG) to include Public Health and
          Bioenvironmental Engineers, Emergency Management, etc.).
          5.4.1.1.2. Civil Engineer (e.g. planners with engineering, environmental, operations,
          natural resources backgrounds).
          5.4.1.1.3. Force Support Squadron (e.g. planners with services, mortuary affairs, etc.
          backgrounds).
          5.4.1.1.4. Functional expertise will be required during specific portions of plan
          development (e.g. Safety, Communications, Public Affairs, Local Emergency
          Planning Committees (LEPC), etc.).
   5.4.2. Step 2. Understand the situation. Understanding hazards and threats are the general
   problems facing the installation. Researching and analyzing information about potential
   hazards and threats facing the installation brings specificity to the planning process.
   Understanding the situation includes a identifying the threats and hazards and assessing risk.
   5.4.3. Step 3. Determine goals and objectives. By using information from the hazard profile
   developed as part of the analysis process, the planning team thinks about how the hazard or
   threat would evolve on the installation and what defines a successful operation. Starting with
   a given intensity for the hazard or threat, the team imagines an event’s development from
   prevention and protection efforts, through initial warning (if available) to its impact on the
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                         35


   installation and surrounding jurisdiction (as identified through analysis) and its generation of
   specific consequences (e.g., collapsed buildings, loss of critical services or infrastructure,
   death, injury, or displacement).
   5.4.4. Step 4. Develop the plan. Plan development includes developing and analyzing
   courses of actions, identifying resources, and identifying information and intelligence needs.
      5.4.4.1. Developing and analyzing courses of action is a process of generating,
      comparing, and selecting possible solutions for achieving the goals and objectives
      identified in step 3. The same scenarios used during problem identification are used to
      develop potential courses of action. For example, some courses of action can be
      developed that may require a significant initial action (such as hardening a facility) or
      creation of an ongoing procedure (such as checking identity cards.). Planners consider the
      needs and demands, goals, and objectives to develop several response alternatives.
      5.4.4.2. Identify Resources. Once courses of action are selected, the planning team
      identifies resources need to accomplish tasks.
   5.4.5. Step 5. Prepare, review, and approve the plan. The planning team develops a rough
   draft of the basic plan, functional or hazard annexes, or other parts of the plan as appropriate.
   As the planning team works through successive drafts, the members add necessary tables,
   charts, and other graphics. A final draft is prepared and circulated to organizations that have
   responsibilities for implementing the plan to obtain their comments.
      5.4.5.1. Criteria commonly used to help in the review of the plan include:
          5.4.5.1.1. Adequacy, determining if the plan can accomplish the assigned mission.
          5.4.5.1.2. Feasibility, determining if the installation can accomplish the assigned
          mission and critical tasks by using available resources to tasks within the time
          contemplated by the plan.
          5.4.5.1.3. Acceptability, determining if it meets senior leaders based on cost and
          statutory guidance.
          5.4.5.1.4. Completeness, determining if the plan incorporates all tasks to be
          accomplished and all required capabilities.
   5.4.6. Step 6. Implement and maintain the plan. Exercising the plan and evaluating its
   effectiveness involve using training and exercises and evaluation of actual events to
   determine whether the goals, objectives, decisions, actions, and timing outlined in the plan
   led to a successful response. The planning team should also consider reviewing and updating
   the plan after the following events:
      5.4.6.1. A major accident/incident.
      5.4.6.2. A formal update of planning guidance and standards.
      5.4.6.3. Change in senior leadership.
      5.4.6.4. Major exercises.
5.5. Unit Implementing Instructions.
 36                                                             AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013


   5.5.1. There are several types of implementing instructions that organizations may develop
   to include: Operating Instructions, Operating Guides, Standard Operating Procedures, QRCs,
   etc.
   5.5.2. Implementing instructions to the IEMP 10-2 must be reviewed and approved by the
   unit commander every two years. They should only require R&EM Flight coordination when
   the IEMP 10-2 is revised. Implementing instructions will be reviewed during unit staff
   assistance visits. . When reviewing the implementing instructions, look for:
      5.5.2.1. Step-by-step instructions for carrying out specific responsibilities.
      5.5.2.2. Resources needed to perform the task.
      5.5.2.3. Standards to which the task must be performed.
      5.5.2.4. Information that may contradict the IEMP 10-2.
5.6. Support and Mutual Aid Agreements.
   5.6.1. It is essential that the EM planning process includes a thorough understanding of the
   agreements in place at the installation. MOAs and MOUs are used to define areas of broad
   agreement between two or more parties.
      5.6.1.1. MOAs are memorandums that define general areas of conditional agreement
      between two or more parties – the actions of the other party depend on what the other
      party does (e.g., one party agrees to provide support if the other party provides the
      materials).
      5.6.1.2. MOUs are memorandums that define general areas of understanding between
      two or more parties. MOUs explain what each party plans to do. However, what each
      party does is not dependent on the actions of the other party (e.g., does not require
      reimbursement or other support from receiver).
      5.6.1.3. Mutual Aid. Typically, installations have entered into earlier mutual assistance
      agreements (“mutual aid”) with the local community in the areas of firefighting, medical
      evacuation and/or other areas as appropriate. For situations where the requested support
      falls within the mutual assistance agreement, the installation responds based on that
      agreement.

Section 6A—Information Management

6.1. Information Management Tasks. If the flight does not have an assigned Information
Management specialist, flight leadership will assign tasks as necessary.
6.2. File Plan. Establish and maintain a flight file plan, including electronic files, according to
AFRIMS. According to AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, each unit should develop a
vital records plan. The plan is a description of records that are vital to continue operations. Only
those record series or electronic information systems (or portions of them) most critical to
emergency operations should be so designated. As a minimum, designate the IEMP 10-2 and
EOC implementing instructions as vital records and maintain a back-up copy on the respective
MAJCOM EM site to meet the off-site storage requirement.
6.3. Standard Publications. Maintain standard AF publications, such as AFIs, AFMANs,
MAJCOM supplements, installation instructions and supplements, related plans, and other
publications according to AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. AF publications
are available on the AF Electronic Publishing web-site at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil.
6.4. Operating Guides. Develop, maintain, and schedule annual review of EM implementing
instructions. Table 6.1, lists recommended EM Operating Guides or topics that can be combined
into continuity procedures.

   whenever generated at the installation level. Forward approved AFTO Form 22 to the
   MAJCOM EM Functional Manager.
   6.6.3. Review TO changes to ensure equipment is stored, marked, serviced, and used
   correctly, including training equipment.
   6.6.4. Coordinate TO changes with the other elements within the Flight to ensure training
   plans, implementing instructions, and operational plans are current. Brief flight personnel on
   TO changes that affect their responsibilities.
6.5. Suspense File. Develop and maintain a R&EM Flight suspense file.
6.6. Air Force Time Compliance Technical Order Process.

Section 6B—Community of Practice

6.7. Collaboration and Social Media Sites.
   6.7.1. Provide installation EM information via a flight CoP, milSuite, or internal website.
   Table 6.2, provides suggested items for posting to the installation R&EM collaboration site.

Table 6.2. Suggested Installation R&EM Collaboration Site Posting Items.
                                   Collaboration Site Items

Links to EM-related websites
EM “Be Ready” Awareness campaign materials (Visual Aids, Newsletters, Reference Material,
etc.)
Flight contact information
   6.7.2. Social Media Utilization. Social media applications such as milSuite may be utilized
   to disseminate EM information to the installation general populace.
       6.7.2.1. Keep in mind that information on social media sites must not be sensitive in
       nature, as all social media platforms are open to the general public.
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                       39


      6.7.2.2. Prior to creating an official social media page, contact the installation public
      affairs office to determine all local guidance and ensure compliance with AFI 35-113,
      Internal Information, Section 15 (Social Media) and AFI 35-107, Public Web
      Communications, provides guidance for demonstrating the need to have a social media
      presence.

Section 6C—Installation “Be Ready Awareness” Campaign

6.8. Purpose. In support of requirements identified in DODI 6055.17 and AFI 10-2501,
establishes the Air Force “Be Ready” Awareness Campaign designed to provide Emergency
Managers at every Air Force installation a standardized, yet diverse method to disseminate
hazard and basic awareness information. The program meets EM educational requirements by:
   6.8.1. Providing emergency managers a standardized method to disseminate information
   spanning major topic areas; basic planning, natural disasters, man-made events, and after a
   disaster.
   6.8.2. Enhancing the emergency manager’s ability to publicize their installation’s emergency
   management program in a professional and affordable manner.
   6.8.3. Marketing the capabilities of the AF EM program. It is designed to bring customers to
   the R&EM Flight as the recognized emergency management experts on the installation.
6.9. Process. Setting up an effective “Be Ready” Awareness Campaign process requires the
following steps:
      6.9.1. Hazard Analysis. The campaign must target the hazards facing the installation.
      6.9.2. Identify Resources. Determine what products have been developed that could
      support the installation’s local awareness campaign.
          6.9.2.1. Utilize the AF EM “Be Ready” Awareness Campaign Product Catalog to
          identify products. This catalog is available on the R&EM CoP and provides a
          consolidated list of products and description of products.
          6.9.2.2. AFCEC/CXR will centrally manage the ordering and printing of products
          and coordinates with the Government Printing Office (GPO) as the single product
          ordering source. Using GPO institutionalizes and standardizes formatting across the
          AF and reduces overall cost per item delivered.
              6.9.2.2.1. AFCEC/CXR will periodically conduct a bulk print ordering period
              which allows an installation to order products shown in the catalog.
              6.9.2.2.2. Each installation receives the best pricing possible for products through
              bulk printing processes. Although an estimated cost for each product is announced
              at the time of the ordering period, actual costs will be determined based on the
              volume of products ordered by all offices world-wide.
      6.9.3. Determine the type and quantity of products needed to adequately support a local
      awareness campaign. Quantities should be based on population, lifespan of the products,
      planned need (i.e., training, exercises, and inspections).
 40                                                              AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013


       6.9.4. Establish a budget baseline and adjust requirements as necessary. Consider
       stock/overstock concerns. Incorporate this requirement into the overall flight budget. This
       is part of the R&EM Flight Financial model.
       6.9.5. Create a plan for how to execute the campaign. Consider how to get the campaign
       message out.
           6.9.5.1. Use the AFCEC/CXR developed solutions, along with local sources such as
           social media, installation public websites, commander's calls, newspapers, and
           installation marquees.
           6.9.5.2. Continuously look for opportunities to market your awareness message to the
           installation community. Examples include booths at the Exchange or Chapel and
           interaction with the installation's Public Affairs office – be creative.
       6.9.6. Evaluate the campaign’s effectiveness. For example, analyze trends by
       determining any increases/decreases in:
           6.9.6.1. Customers coming to the flight requesting information.
           6.9.6.2. Calls and emails with inquiries.
           6.9.6.3. Visits to the social media and installation’s public websites.
           6.9.6.4. Requests for briefings at commander’s call or other similar functions.
           6.9.6.5. Observations or strengths identified during local exercises.

Section 6D—Communications

6.10. Home Station Land Mobile Radio Requirements. In addition to a dedicated EM net,
EM Sections should have access to a minimum of the following radio nets: airfield control tower,
fire/crash, CE, SF, and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). If the EM Section does not have a
dedicated EM net, work with the Installation Spectrum Manager (ISM).
   6.10.1. Contractors must submit frequency requests in direct support of AF contracts through
   the AF representative (normally the ISM if on an AF base) to the MAJCOM responsible for
   administering the contract.
   6.10.2. Under emergency conditions, several government agencies (e.g., FEMA operations)
   may operate on, or near, frequencies assigned to AF organizations. When this occurs, one of
   the involved agencies should coordinate with the affected AF organization to arrange
   frequency sharing during the emergency. AF units will cooperate fully during emergencies
   unless frequency sharing would jeopardize mission-essential operations.
6.11. Secondary Crash Network (SCN). Requirements for the EM Section’s secondary crash
net are outlined in AFI 13-204 Volume 3, Airfield Operations Procedures and Programs. This
AFI identifies minimum requirements for agencies to be added to the SCN. Typically the SCN
will be activated for certain activities. The EM Section must have established processes in the
event of SCN activations listed in Table 6.3, below.
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                  41

                                     MISSION SUPPORT

Section 7A—Unit EM Programs

7.1. Unit Level EM Program. Ensure each unit assigned or attached to the installation has a
viable EM program. This means a practical, realistic program that ensures a unit can prepare to
respond and recover from various hazards/threats facing the installation.
7.2. Unit EM Program Scoping Factors. Not every unit EM program has the same
requirements and should be tailored based on the unit’s mission and EM responsibilities. The
EMWG should approve the scope or depth of each unit EM program. Consider factors such as
the unit’s size, mission, IEMP 10-2 responsibilities, and UTC taskings. The EM Section may
need to adjust scoping at deployed locations.
7.3. Unit EM Program Tiers. Recommend dividing EM programs into two tiers based on
Table 7.1 The purpose is to identify EM programs that have a more direct impact on the DRF.
Units that meet the majority of the qualifications listed determine the respective tier.

Table 7.1. Unit EM Program Tiers.

                                            Maintain an EM information program.
Notes:
1. The SFS provides a clear example of a Tier I program. SFS directly supports the DRF
because it is represented in the EOC; they have First/Emergency Responders;
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                          43


response/recovery teams (e.g. military working dog team); critical unit control center
activities; and large mobility commitments.
2. The local high school located on the installation does not directly support the DRF but
still needs to ensure personnel can respond to incidents on the installation. This could be
one example of a Tier II program or consolidated under the responsibility of a Tier I
program such as the Force Support Squadron.
      7.3.1. Consolidate unit EM programs when it makes sense to do so. For example, the Wing
      Staff is usually comprised of the Antiterrorism (AT) office, Finance, Legal, etc. It may not be
      practical for every wing staff agency to have a separate unit EM program.
7.4. Unit EM Report. The Unit EM Report is a tool EM Sections can use to summarize the
status of a unit’s EM program and, with proper signatures, replace the need for independent
appointment letters.
      7.4.1. Collect Unit EM Reports quarterly. The EMWG can determine a more stringent
      frequency. MAJCOMs are authorized to establish a less stringent frequency through a
      supplement to this manual. Note: If the report is used as an appointment letter, a new report
      should be generated within 72 hours of when EM positions (i.e. EOC, UCC) are staffed.
      Table 7.2, outlines the recommended information required in a unit EM Report.

   7.4.3. The Unit EM Report needs to be a tool used to effectively manage the unit program.
   There should be value-added or a reason for any data collected on the report otherwise the
   information is an unnecessary workload. For example:
       7.4.3.1. Do not collect personal information, such as home phone numbers, unless there
       is a direct EM requirement for the use of the personal information. For example there is
       no reason to collect home phone numbers of the Communication Squadron’s UCC
       members if it’s not used.
       7.4.3.2. If collecting OPEN SAV observations, they should be incorporated into a SAV
       trend analysis.
       7.4.3.3. Training data should be used to determine classes or highlight training process
       deficiencies such as classroom utilization (are too many or too few classes scheduled?).
       7.4.3.4. Do not add information to the Unit EM Report that can be obtained from
       existing sources. For example, ACES-PR already provides data on the number of
       personnel scheduled for classes versus the actual students attending.
       7.4.3.5. Security data might be used to create an EOC EAL.
7.5. Unit Appointment Letters. Appointment letters serve as a confirmation of a unit
commander’s delegation of responsibilities to appropriate personnel for the respective positions
they are to fill; e.g., EM Rep, EMST, EOC, ESF, etc.
   7.5.1. When opportunities exist and with appropriate coordination, the Unit EM Report
   could serve both the program accountability actions and appointment of personnel.
   7.5.2. If not combined with the Unit EM Report, units will develop a standardized method
   for ensuring commander’s appoint personnel as necessary; MAJCOM Information
   Management Tool (IMT), locally developed IMT, or Memorandum for Record, etc.
7.6. Unit EM Representatives. Maintain steadfast contact with unit EM representatives and
emphasizes the responsibility to meet AFI 10-2501 requirements for unit commanders. The EM
Section will develop a method for distributing information; tracking and scheduling other EM
related training; performing recurring EM Representative training; and coordinating plans,
checklists, or other administrative documents through the units. It is important to relay the
message to unit EM representatives they are managing a unit program on behalf of their
commanders. Members from the EM Section will serve as the primary and alternate unit EM
representatives for the Civil Engineer Squadron.
7.7. Unit EM Continuity Plan. The unit EM program focuses primarily on protecting the lives
of unit members and protecting unit resources. The EM Section must ensure unit EM program
representatives are familiar with their unit’s mission and relationship to the installation EM
program. Assist unit EM representatives in maintaining a unit EM continuity plan. The unit EM
continuity plan should outline the size and scope the program, identifies offices of primary
responsibilities for: planning, training, exercises. The unit EM continuity plan should list all of
the supported units included in the program. See Attachment 4, Example Unit EM Continuity
Plan.
7.8. EM Program Documentation. One key to an efficient unit EM program is documentation.
Documentation includes but is not limited to appointment letters, EM reports, training
certificates, SAV reports, replies, correspondence, class rosters, implementing instructions, and
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                      45


EM exercise/real-world after action reports/documentation. A collaboration site is the ideal
location to store these documents.

Section 7B—Facilities

7.9. Facility Requirements.
   7.9.1. AFMAN 32-1084, Facility Requirements, provides the baseline for emergency
   management facilities and covers requirements for classrooms, control centers, secure
   storerooms, administrative space, decontamination/shower area and latrine, demonstration
   yard, student lounge, standby area, and special requirements for a mask-confidence facility.
   7.9.2. Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-141-04, Emergency Operations Center Planning
   and Design, presents a unified approach for the planning and design of EOCs. This document
   is not intended to establish the requirement for an EOC or establish the operational
   procedures of an EOC. Commanders, security personnel, planners, designers, architects, and
   engineers use this document when planning or designing an EOC so the EM Section should
   be familiar with the publication to provide useful inputs if a new construction is forecasted.

Section 7C—EM Relations with Civil Authorities

7.10. Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs). LEPCs were established by the
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), which include emergency
planning and community right-to-know requirements.
   7.10.1. AFI 10-2501 requires the installation commander to appoint an installation
   representative to the LEPC. A copy of this appointment letter should be sent to the Chairman
   of the LEPC with a courtesy copy to the local OEM.
   7.10.2. The LEPCs were originally created to focus solely on hazardous chemical response,
   but most have taken an all-hazards approach to planning and response. The purpose of the
   LEPC is:
       7.10.2.1. Development, training, and testing of the Hazardous Substances Emergency
       Response Plan for the community.
       7.10.2.2. Development of procedures for regulated facilities to provide informational and
       emergency notification to the LEPC.
       7.10.2.3. Development of procedures for receiving and processing requests from the
       public under EPCRA.
       7.10.2.4. Provision for public notification of LEPC activities.
       7.10.2.5. A major role for LEPCs is to work with industry and the interested public to
       encourage continuous attention to chemical safety, risk reduction, and accident
       prevention by each local stakeholder.
   7.10.3. AFI 10-2501 states that one purpose of appointing a primary and alternate
   installation emergency manager is to facilitate coordination with civilian agencies. More than
   likely, the LEPC may be the forum used in the community to address all-hazard issues. The
   appointed emergency manager and LEPC member may be the same person. Whether they are
   the same person or not, coordination with civilian agencies should include, as a minimum:
 46                                                            AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013


      7.10.3.1. Attending LEPC meetings and bringing issues back/forth to installation
      leadership.
      7.10.3.2. Engaging the local OEM on EM-related initiatives.
      7.10.3.3. Exploring opportunities for joint training and exercise opportunities.
      7.10.3.4. Sharing information and collaborating on procedures to build or maintain a
      COP.
      7.10.3.5. De-conflicting response and recovery issues.
7.11. Additional emergency management mission support resources are available in the
following Table 7.3.

                               FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

8.1. General. The BCE is responsible for providing the R&EM Flight with the funding required
to sustain installation Emergency Management and CE Prime BEEF Program capabilities. The
BCE assigns a RA as overall financial manager for CE programs. The R&EM Flight supports the
BCE and RA through financial planning, program advocacy and funds execution.
8.2. R&EM Financial Program Areas. The R&EM Flight manages funding under the
Facilities Operation and CBRN Defense functional areas and accounts for funding with multiple
sub-areas within each of these functions. Requirements must be entered under the program area
that best supports the need and to provide accurate cost accountability. Cost accountability
guidance is provided for each area. It includes the associated Program Element (PE) and
Responsibility Center/Cost Center (RC/CC) information that financial mangers use to plan, track
and account for funding within each area. Procedures to provide funding for R&EM Flight
military and civilian manpower is not addressed in this publication. For manpower funding
questions, contact the unit manpower office and refer to AFI 38-201, Management of Manpower
Requirements and Authorizations.
   8.2.1. Facilities Operation, Readiness Engineering. Readiness Engineering is the title of the
   Facilities Operation function that includes the R&EM Flight. The installation Facilities
   Operation Program includes CE functions that are performed on an installation that are
   directly related to real property. The R&EM Flight Facilities Operation responsibilities fall
   under the Readiness Engineering function and include emergency management and
   expeditionary engineering capabilities. Cost accounting for the Facilities Operation Program
   is PE XXX79F (See Table 8.1). Guidance for this program is found in AFI 32-10140,
   Programming and Resourcing Appropriated Fund Facilities Operation Requirements,
   Chapter 10, Readiness Engineering.

8.3. Financial Management Operations.
   8.3.1. Local guidance for managing the R&EM budget and financial programs are
   established by the installation and CE squadron RA. AF/A7CX and MAJCOM Civil
   Engineers may provide supplemental financial guidance on the use of CE managed funds for
   the current or next fiscal year. The intent of this supplemental guidance is to synchronize
   funding efforts between MAJCOMs and installations and ensure similar and complementary
   capabilities are fielded at all installations worldwide.
   8.3.2. Use the R&EM Flight Budget Template to develop the baseline funding requirements
   for the flight. Use the AF CWDE Baseline Calculator to validate Groundcrew CWDE
   requirements and the AF Aircrew Flight Equipment Baseline Calculator for aircrew funding.
   These and other financial management tools are available on the R&EM CoP under the
   Installation Financial Management area.
   8.3.3. R&EM Flight leadership and financial managers must attend installation level training
   courses or orientations to effectively manage the flight programs. The CE squadron RA is the
   primary point of contact to request this training.
8.4. Unfunded Requirements. Identify unfunded requirements as part of the CE squadron
budget process. Maintain a current list of these items throughout the year and add or delete
requirements as needed. Include information such as the functional area, execution OPR,
description, quantity, cost, mission impact and priority. Keep the list current throughout the year
and provide requirements to the CE squadron RA and MAJCOM EM staff on a monthly basis.
Coordinate closely with the execution OPR to ensure that requirements remain valid and that the
organization is prepared to rapidly execute funds.

                                          Chapter 9

                            ASSESSMENTS AND EXERCISES

Section 9A—EM Staff Assistance Visit (SAV) Program

9.1. Purpose. This chapter provides the guidance and procedures for installation-level Unit EM
SAVs. It also directs a self-inspection for the R&EM Flight and each installation unit. The
installation SAV program is a commander’s tool to help units support the AF, MAJCOM, and
installation EM program.
9.2. Emergency Management Staff Assistance Visit Guidance.
   9.2.1. The objective of unit EM SAVs is to enhance the organization’s ability to execute its
   assigned mission.
   9.2.2. SAVs provide a method to assist unit EM representative meet program compliance
   with directives and evaluate/correct problem areas.
   9.2.3. Use MAJCOM guidance for SAV report formats, requirements for formal replies,
   routing, and suspense dates for correcting deficiencies. Deficiencies noted in SAVs should be
   tracked within established self-inspection programs.
   9.2.4. R&EM Flights will program funding for any necessary travel expenses associated
   with conducting SAVs on GSUs.
9.3. Staff Assistance Visit Checklist.
   9.3.1. Develop a localized SAV checklist based upon MAJCOM guidance or the sample
   installation SAV checklist located on the R&EM Flight CoP.
       9.3.1.1. Through the EMWG, highlight program critical and non-critical items. This will
       provide focus for a unit’s EM representative’s efforts and increase trend analysis value.
       9.3.1.2. Once the installation has developed its SAV checklists, ensure that each unit EM
       representative receives a copy.
   9.3.2. Unit EM representatives should use the SAV checklist to perform self-assessments six
   months after last SAV and two-to-four weeks prior to next scheduled SAV. Additional self-
   assessments may be required by MAJCOM or determined locally.
   9.3.3. Unit EM representatives must track open deficiencies until closed. Units with open
   items will have a plan and an estimated completion date to resolve the deficiency.
9.4. Staff Assistance Visit Schedule.
   9.4.1. Develop, coordinate, and distribute a SAV schedule on an annual basis and conduct
   annual SAVs on units identified by the installation EMWG. The annual SAV schedule is
   tentative. Each visit should be coordinated with the unit EM representative and commander
   at least two weeks before the visit.
   9.4.2. Explore and implement efficiencies when developing a SAV plan by aligning units
   functionally, depending upon the installation organizational structure. For example, perform
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                     51


   SAVs on all units within a group together in order to provide the group commander a roll-up
   assessment.
   9.4.3. The active duty host performs a SAV on the Reserve wing through the Reserve
   R&EM Flight ART. The Reserve R&EM ART conducts SAVs on the Reserve units for
   Reserve EM program requirements and ensures the Reserve wing is in compliance with host
   unit EM program.
   9.4.4. Balance the SAV schedule with AEF training windows and other areas of high
   workload, such as installation exercises or higher headquarters inspections. Work with the
   installation gatekeeper to coordinate major calendar events.
9.5. Conduct the Staff Assistance Visit.
   9.5.1. Before conducting the SAV, review supporting documents such as:
       9.5.1.1. The unit’s IEMP 10-2 taskings.
       9.5.1.2. Previously documented SAV results.
       9.5.1.3. The unit’s EM Report.
       9.5.1.4. Exercise and evaluation reports.
       9.5.1.5. Unit EM training statistics.
   9.5.2. Formal in-briefs to the unit commander and the unit EM representative set the stage
   for a cooperative visit. This courtesy should be offered to every unit commander. However,
   out-briefs should be part of the entire SAV process and actively coordinated to ensure the
   opportunity to summarize the readiness of the unit to the commander. Allow time to validate
   observations, organize notes, etc. Leave a list of observations and recommendations with the
   unit visited.
   9.5.3. When conducting the visit, observe and review unit EM accomplishments and
   activities. Identify commendable areas and problems. Explain how to correct problems that
   cannot be corrected immediately.
   9.5.4. R&EM Flight leadership will submit the written SAV report to the CE Commander
   within five duty days after the out-brief. After the CE Commander signs the report (signature
   may be electronic), forward the report to the unit commander. The report should include
   commendable areas, improvement areas, problems identified, suggested solutions, assistance
   provided, and MAJCOM guidance.
   9.5.5. Provide and document follow-up visits as required by the MAJCOM.
   9.5.6. The unit EM SAV for the CE unit is not synonymous with the required self-
   assessment. Do not have the same person conduct both the SAV and self-inspection. With
   advanced coordination, this could be an emergency manager from another AF installation, an
   ARC tenant unit, or as a minimum someone else in the flight.
9.6. Staff Assistance Visit Trend Analysis.
   9.6.1. Establish methods to track SAV replies and corrective actions. See Figure 9.1
   9.6.2. Include a SAV trend analysis during the EMWG and provide to MAJCOMs as
   directed.

Section 9B—Self-Assessment

9.7. Self-Assessment. The R&EM Flight will most likely have a requirement to conduct a self-
assessment of each and every program the flight is responsible for.
   9.7.1. Unit self-assessment should be coordinated with the appointed CE Squadron self-
   inspection monitor and conducted according to AFI 90-201.
   9.7.2. Deficiencies beyond the capability of the R&EM Flight should be elevated to the CE
   commander as soon as possible to put corrective actions in place.

Section 9C—Exercise Support and Planning

9.8. Exercise Support. Emergency management capabilities need to be evaluated even if not
part of the installation exercise program. This includes coordinating cross-functional drills with
other base agencies such as FES and BE.
   9.8.1. DODI 6055.17, states that the installation exercise evaluation teams be staffed with
   subject matter experts in EM who are familiar with the Homeland Security Exercise and
   Evaluation Program (HSEEP), Volume III. HSEEP is a capabilities and performance-based
   exercise program which provides a standardized policy, methodology, and terminology for
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                          53


   exercise design, development, conduct, evaluation, and improvement planning. Although the
   responsibilities of the installation exercise program do not fall on the R&EM Flight, it’s
   important for EM personnel to understand and utilize key HSEEP aspects.
   9.8.2. Optimally, EM personnel involved in exercise planning should attend the HSEEP
   Training Course. The HSEEP Training Course is an intermediate-level training course that
   incorporates exercise guidance and best practices from the HSEEP Volumes.
9.9. Exercise Planning Process. The EM Section supports the installation exercises by
providing evaluators and training. The EM Section should work with the installation WIT as
subject matter experts in the development of readiness exercises. The CE squadron typically has
a team of exercise evaluators to test and evaluate the myriad of CE capabilities (i.e., utility
repairs, firefighting operations, EM ACR, etc.).
   9.9.1. The following steps will facilitate developing and tracking unit exercise objectives.
       9.9.1.1. Step 1. Define the capabilities to evaluate. Prior to providing the installation
       exercise objectives for scheduled exercises, know the BCE’s priorities of what CE
       capabilities need to be evaluated. In broad terms, one should identify capabilities to
       evaluate, CE OPRs, and the type of exercise most applicable for the evaluation. Sample
       exercise capabilities are shown in Table 9.1
       9.9.1.2. Step 2. Identify the critical tasks associated with each identified capability.
       Knowing what actions need to be evaluated for each capability will keep focus on the
       evaluation. If these tasks are not already pre-identified, document the tasks prior to the
       evaluation. Sample critical exercise tasks are shown in Table 9.2

Table 9.1. Sample Exercise Capabilities.

       9.9.1.3. Step 3. Tailor Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Task-Oriented
       (SMART) objectives. The objectives should identify the conditions, actions required and
       standards. Sample SMART objectives are shown in Table 9.3
       9.9.1.4. Step 4. Trend the objectives. The installation exercise office should have an
       established process to track discrepancies. However, it’s important for unit exercise
       planners to have visibility on how well CE met exercise objectives. Analyzing CE
       exercise trends and any conditions that may have changed can be used to determine if the
       evaluation needs to be repeated in future exercises. Sample exercise trend objectives are
       shown in Table 9.4

   and observations. Work closely with the CE self-inspection monitor to develop corrective
   actions and elevate issues to the CE Commander if help is required to close open action
   items. Most deficiencies can be addressed through improved training, developing or
   improving existing checklists/processes, or obtaining required equipment.

                                          Attachment 2
                          MASK CONFIDENCE TRAINING (MCT)

A2.1. Qualitative Fit Testing (QLFT). Building confidence in the wear of the mask may be a
supplemental objective of CBRN Defense Skills training. The purpose of this objective is to
check the fit and operation of the mask and instill mask confidence, also referred to as qualitative
fit testing QLFT.
   A2.1.1. QLFT exercises determine whether or not someone can detect various scents or
   flavors or can experience a negative reaction to a substance that can cause burning, watering
   eyes. This is an assurance test that ensures the wearer of the mask can confidently use the
   military protective mask in a CBRN test environment. Although this fit factor is subjective
   and doesn’t replace the requirement for a quantitative fit factor (QNFT), there are still
   benefits.
   A2.1.2. Mask Confidence Training (MCT) exercises, if employed, must use the methods
   approved by the Air Force Surgeon General's Office. The approved methods include:
       A2.1.2.1. Stannic Chloride.
       A2.1.2.2. Isoamyl Acetate (banana oil).
       A2.1.2.3. Camphor        crystals,   ochlorobenzylidene      malononitrile      (CS)     and
       chloroacetophenone (CN). CS is the preferred agent; use CN when CS is not available.
       Note: The Office of the Surgeon General strongly rejects any MCT procedures involving
       the use of CS or CN "which require personnel to enter a training facility unprotected,
       remain so until instructed to mask, and then stay in place until the student clears the mask
       of agent."
   A2.1.3. The nominal logistical requirements for Stanic Chloride and Isoamyl acetate (i.e.
   ability to conduct training inside the classroom) makes their use more practical than
   Camphor, CS, and CN which have very stringent standards.
A2.2. Responsibilities. Offices conducting MCT will develop training/safety procedures that
comply with this manual.
A2.3. Reaction to Agents. Direct anyone suffering adverse reactions, other than temporary
coughing or minor burning or tearing of the eyes, to the installation medical treatment facility for
evaluation and treatment. If immediate action is needed, the instructor or assistant must notify
medical personnel. The installation medical unit will evaluate these adverse reactions as
occupational illnesses and identify each incident to their MAJCOM SGP and A7C. MAJCOM
SGPs will identify adverse trends to AFMSA/SGO and AFCEC/CX.
A2.4. Basic Requirements. The following applies to all MCT.
   A2.4.1. Challenge Agents. Use CS or CN, stannic chloride, isoamyl acetate (banana oil), or
   camphor crystals.
   A2.4.2. Facilities. For CS or CN operations, the facility must be at least 100 meters from
   any occupied structure. If a tent is used, earth should be banked around the tent's base to help
   prevent escape of CS or CN. During training, all challenge agent vapors and aerosols should
   be contained within the facility to the greatest extent possible.
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                         67


       A2.4.2.1. The facility should have adequate lighting. Separate entry and exit doorways
       are preferred.
       A2.4.2.2. An eyewash station satisfying AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated
       Occupational Safety Instruction, must be readily available.
       A2.4.2.3. Conduct a safety inspection of the facility before training exercises. Ensure a
       fire extinguisher is available and note its location.
   A2.4.3. Training Exercises. Students will perform exercises listed in Table A2.1, within
   the training environment using the military CBRN respirator.

Table A2.1. MCT Training Exercises.
Normal Breathing - In a normal standing position, without talking, the subject breathes
normally.
Deep Breathing - In a normal standing position, the subject breathes slowly and deeply, taking
care not to hyperventilate.
Turning head side-to-side - Standing in place, the subject slowly turns his/her head from side to
side between extreme positions on each side. The subject holds his/her head at each extreme
momentarily to allow the subject to inhale at each side.
Moving head up and down - Standing in place, the subject slowly moves his/her head up and
down. Instruct the subject to inhale in the up position (i.e., when looking toward the ceiling).
Rotating chin – Standing in place, the subject moves his/her jaw in a circular pattern, holding
the mouth slightly open to simulate speaking.
A2.5. CS, CN, and Camphor Procedures:
   A2.5.1. Safety Precautions:
       A2.5.1.1. One instructor per six students is suggested. Instructors will be certified in
       cardiopulmonary resuscitation and basic first aid. There will be two instructors as a
       minimum per MCT facility. The instructors must be clearly identifiable by wearing
       clothing such as coveralls, high-density polyethylene fiber suits, or brightly colored vests.
       One primary instructor will be located inside the facility and one secondary instructor,
       acting as a safety backup, will be located outside the facility.
       A2.5.1.2. CS, CN, and camphor require a heat-generating device (e.g., canned heat,
       candle, or hot plate). Wear heat resistant gloves when handling.
       A2.5.1.3. To avoid exposure to the challenge agents, students will don, clear and seal the
       mask and don the Groundcrew Chemical Ensemble (GCE) before entering the MCT
       facility.
       A2.5.1.4. Before donning the mask, women will remove hair fasteners (hair clips, pins)
       and let hair hang freely, tucked within the GCE jacket.
       A2.5.1.5. Pregnant women or women who may be pregnant, and those with appropriate
       medical waivers, will not participate in MCT. After medical approval, the unit will
       reschedule these subjects for MCT.
       A2.5.1.6. Should a student become ill inside the MCT facility, immediately remove
       him/her into fresh air and contact medical services as necessary.
 68                                                             AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013


   A2.5.2. Pre-MCT Actions:
       A2.5.2.1. CS and CN. Prepare an aerosol concentration in the facility according to
       installation BE recommendations. The CS or CN vapor level should not exceed 10
       milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3). Don't use more than one capsule in facilities 200
       cubic meters (7062 cubic feet) or smaller. For larger facilities, estimate the number of
       capsules using the following formula: Room Volume in Cubic Meters x 0.0107 =
       Estimated Number of Capsules Needed.
       A2.5.2.2. Camphor. Vaporize the camphor. Normally, use 1 to 2 ounces of camphor
       crystals placed on a heat generator. The camphor does not need to be completely
       vaporized for an initial concentration. Remove or extinguish the heat source after initial
       vapor concentration is established, then reheat as necessary to maintain the concentration.
       A2.5.2.3. Instructor Actions. See Table A2.2

Table A2.2. CS, CN, and Camphor MCT Instructor Actions.
1. Brief students on the purpose of the training, type of agent being used, MCT actions, and
safety requirements.
2. Preposition students waiting to enter the facility upwind to avoid potential exposure to the
challenge agent before masking.
3. Have students don masks and properly clear, seal and check for problems. Assist students with
mask or GCE problems before entering the MCT.
4. Have students enter the MCT facility individually or in small groups. Six students per
instructor is recommended.
5. Perform training exercises according to Table A2.1.
6. If the training agent is detected during the MCT, have the student immediately leave the
facility. The secondary instructor will identify and correct the problem.
7. Once the problem has been corrected, have the student reenter the facility.
8. When the instructor has determined that the masks are operating properly, have one student at
a time face the instructor, remove his/her mask, and immediately leave the MCT facility.
Continue until all students have left.
9. Before leaving the MCT, extinguish the heat-generating device.
10. Face students into the wind until their eyes have cleared.
11. Ensure water and paper towels are available for students to wash their faces and any exposed
skin.
12. Brief students on problem areas.
13. As part of the training, ensure students clean and properly store masks.
A2.6. Isoamyl Acetate (Banana Oil) Procedures:
   A2.6.1. Safety Precautions. Conduct an isoamyl acetate vapor test outdoors (calm winds)
   or in a well-ventilated indoor location. Caution: Isoamyl acetate is flammable; prohibit
   smoking or open flames near the MCT area. Conduct the MCT wearing rubber gloves to
   prevent the isoamyl acetate from contacting the fingers. After MCT, wash hands with soap
   and water. Dispose of used ampoules or swabs in outdoor trash containers.
   A2.6.2. Instructor Actions. See Table A2.3
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                           69


   A2.6.3. Post-MCT Actions. Each student passing the banana oil test will be given a
   sensitivity screening check to confirm he/she can detect the smell of banana oil. If the agent
   in the air has already dissipated, hold the swab about two inches from the student’s head. If
   the student detects the smell, the test was valid. Failure to detect the smell voids the fit test.
   Redo the test using a different qualitative mask confidence protocol (normally, stannic
   chloride).

Table A2.3. Isoamyl Acetate MCT Instructor Actions.
1. When using agent from the bottle, dip a cotton swab and squeeze out excess liquid. Use
ampoules according to manufacturer's instructions. Normally, use one swab or ampoule for at
least 10 students.
2. Present the agent about two inches from the student's mask. Move around the facepiece (don't
touch the mask or wearer), outlet valve/voicemitter assembly, eyelenses, and air intakes.
3. Training Exercises. Have students perform training exercises according to Table A2.1.
4. If the agent is detected during the MCT, help the student correct the problem (e.g., adjust
straps) and resume the test.
A2.7. Stannic Chloride Procedures:
   A2.7.1. Safety Precautions. QLFT uses a subject's response to the irritating chemicals
   released in the "smoke" produced by a stannic chloride smoke tube to detect leakage into the
   respirator.
       A2.7.1.1. The smoke can be irritating to the eyes, lungs, and nasal passages. The test
       administrator must take precautions to minimize the test subject's exposure to irritant
       smoke.
       A2.7.1.2. Training will be conducted in an area with adequate ventilation to prevent
       exposure of the person conducting the fit test or buildup of irritant smoke in the
       atmosphere.
       A2.7.1.3. MCT Instructor Actions. See Table A2.4

Table A2.4. Stannic Chloride MCT Instructor Actions.
1. Using a squeeze bulb, direct the stream of irritant smoke from the smoke tube toward the
faceseal area of the student.
2. Begin at least 12 inches from the facepiece and move the smoke stream around the entire
perimeter of the mask.
3. Gradually make two more passes around the perimeter of the mask, moving to within six
inches of the mask.
4. Training Exercises. Have students perform training exercises according to Table A2.1.
5. If the agent is detected during the MCT, the instructor helps the student correct the problem
(e.g., adjust straps) and resumes the test.
   A2.7.2. Post-MCT Actions. Each test subject passing the irritant smoke test without
   evidence of a response (involuntary cough, irritation) will be given a sensitivity screening
   check with the smoke from the same smoke tube used during the fit test once the mask has
   been removed to determine whether he/she reacts to the smoke. Failure to evoke a response
   voids the test. Repeat the test using a different qualitative mask confidence protocol.

                                          Attachment 3
                        IN-HOUSE TRAINING (IHT) PROCEDURES

A3.1. Introduction. The purpose of this attachment is to assist flights with the development of
a comprehensive-capabilities based training plan. While this guide will standardize in-house
training across the career field, it will still allow flights to customize training plans to fit the
specific needs and site requirements of each installation and MAJCOMs.
   A3.1.1. Proficiency training provides an opportunity for all EM personnel, whether they are
   active duty, guard, reserve, or civilian, to update and maintain their technical and
   professional skills. When accomplished correctly, proficiency training provides, “return on
   investment” training, higher productivity, better teamwork, improved quality, increased
   initiative, enhanced motivation, an imaginative approach to the job, inspiring innovation,
   creative problem-solving.
A3.2. Research. The starting point for an effective IHT program are reviewing publications
that contain career field training requirements such as the CFETP, AF Form 1098, Special Task
Certification and Recurring Training, Air Force Qualification and Training Packages (AFQTPs),
and AFI 10-210. The training program should focus on local requirements: mission, local threats
and duty specific training and acknowledge/identify the strengths and weaknesses within the
R&EM Flight.
   A3.2.1. CFETP. This document is a comprehensive education and training document
   identifying life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and
   minimum requirements for the 3E9X1 specialty. Use these requirements as a starting point to
   form a robust IHT program.
   A3.2.2. AF Form 1098. This form identifies additional Emergency Management
   proficiency task requirements for maintaining qualification in the individual’s duty position.
   1098s are established by the Career Field Manager, MAJCOM Functional Area Manager, or
   Unit Level Functional Area Manager and lays out task requirements for maintaining the
   designated proficiency training.
   A3.2.3. AFQTP. AFQTPs are instructional packages, either paper or web-based, which aids
   in qualification, in a duty position, program, or on a piece of equipment. AFQTPs can greatly
   enhance the flight’s IHT program by providing standardized training materials used
   throughout the career field.
   A3.2.4. AFI 10-210. This instruction governs the Prime BEEF program. Within this
   guidance, 3E9X1 Home Station Training requirements are identified by topic, frequency, and
   training source. This reference is a valuable source to find out which core Prime BEEF
   wartime/contingency standards Emergency Managers need to focus on.
A3.3. Identify the Workload. Once training requirements are identified, determine how much
time is needed annually to accomplish the training. This depends on which items are recurring,
which concepts need more time for review, how much time is needed to perform a practical
application, and so on.
   A3.3.1. Based on this information, develop an IHT schedule to meet the established
   objectives. Assign instructors based upon flight personnel expertise and experience. Provide
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                        71


   the training schedule to EMST members, FES, ARC EM and BE personnel who may benefit
   from participating in the training. Coordinate joint and cross functional training with outside
   agencies. Combining training will produce a synergistic installation response force.
   Additionally, it will aid in the development and validation of cross functional checklists, and
   cohesive response processes. The EM Section should be obtaining the annual and monthly
   training schedules from the following agencies: FES, EOD, Bioenvironmental, SFs, ARC
   units on the installation and Local EM Offices and response agencies. Combining EM
   proficiency training with these other agencies can increase agency confidence and
   interoperability. Table A3.1, provides examples of training that can be combined.

Table A3.1. Example Combined Training Activities.
 Participate with FES during HAZMAT training/exercises
 Integrate into EOD/SF Night Vision Goggle classes
 Sample analysis exercises with Bioenvironmental
 Participate and use the EM emergency response vehicle during local exercises and/or SF/EOD
 response exercises
 Install detection equipment on EODs robot during a suspect item, Improvised Explosive
 Device, response exercise or HAZMAT response exercise
 Coordinate with SF and Office of Special Investigations for scene preservation, evidence
 handling and chain of custody procedures
   A3.3.2. Proficiency training enhances flight personnel’s ability to perform wartime duties.
   Consider manning, mission needs, competing squadron and installation activities. Ensure
   flexibility to react to unforeseen circumstances like natural disasters, exercises,
   mobilizations, accidents/incidents, and so forth. When the schedule is built and approved it is
   time to implement. The goal is to set aside at least one day a week to focus on IHT schedule
   items. Utilize AF Form 4451, Emergency Management (EM) In-House Training Forecast to
   forecast training quarterly. This form will require unit commander’s signature for approval.
A3.4. Identify Training Sources. Proficiency training may be in-residence, exportable, or
OJT. Exercises and annual CE bivouacs provide additional venues for EM proficiency training.
Valuable training also occurs on a daily basis through everyday interactions with other on or off-
base agencies and that training should also be captured in the training records. Examples are staff
meetings, Prime BEEF days, conferences, exercises, TDYs, and real-world responses. IHT,
upgrade training, and outside training experiences will work hand-in-hand in the development of
the knowledge, skills, and abilities of flight members. It is not always possible for flight
leadership to be at every training event. However, it is encouraged that they attend on a topic
specific basis.
   A3.4.1. For EM personnel to effectively execute response and management capabilities, time
   must be dedicated for proficiency training. All EM personnel require a standardized common
   knowledge and skill set that is interoperable across the MAJCOMs. This guide will outline
   the best way to achieve those results.
A3.5. Training Scenarios. Functional exercises provide an opportunity to stay current on
capabilities and improve proficiency in a risk free environment. Scenarios should reinforce and
hone the knowledge, skills and abilities reviewed during in-house training. The goal is to allow
 72                                                             AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013


personnel to formulate plans, select and use equipment, manage personnel, and direct operations
to respond to a situation before there is an actual need.
   A3.5.1. Trainers will establish and define training objectives and standards to all flight
   members prior to the start of each exercise. Each exercise, as a minimum, should include
   demonstration of: notification procedures, equipment selection/load-out, response, safety
   briefing, command and control, proper use of personal protective equipment, research, after
   actions, and situational reports.
   A3.5.2. When possible, conduct exercises with other response agencies. This will reinforce
   roles and responsibilities as they relate to combined efforts, resources, and team dynamics.
   Consider weekends and non-duty hours for conducting joint training/exercises as these times
   often are detached from flying operations or other daily activities that prevent units such as
   SFS or FES from being able to participate.
   A3.5.3. Specialty Training Standard (STS) items may be accomplished during specific
   training events. STS line items may be employed differently depending on the type of
   scenario to which they are applied, so it may be necessary to use STS items multiple times.
A3.6. IHT Tool. This workbook-based tool was established by AFCEC/CXR to assist EM
flights with determining, facilitating, and scheduling training requirements. The tool is formatted
in a series of tabbed spreadsheets to include AF Form1098, Prime BEEF, and additional training
requirements. An integrated schedule generator will populate requirements, as well as displaying
which training requirement is coming due. This tool can be obtained from the R&EM Flight
CoP.
AFMAN32-1007 30 MAY 2013                                                                      73
