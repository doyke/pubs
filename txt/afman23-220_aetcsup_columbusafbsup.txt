SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This supplement is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.


       8.3.5. Commanders will ensure appropriate actions are taken for lost, damaged or
       destroyed government property; particularly losses under unusual or recurring
       circumstances, regardless of dollar value. Coordinate with the Reports of Survey (ROS)
       program manager to document/identify trends. ROS program manager will include in
       trend analysis to management.
       8.4.4. ROS program manager is delegated authority to approve not processing a ROS
       when the value is under $500 and a ROS is not required.
9.1. The Commander, 14th Mission Support Group (14 MSG/CC), is “designated” the
appointing authority “to take action on ROS when the loss or damage is less than $2000, and
there is no evidence of negligence, willful misconduct or deliberate unauthorized use.”

11.2. 14 MSG/LGLO is the office responsible for administering the ROS Program.

11.8. The initiator/investigating officer will immediately notify the ROS program manager if the
responsible person is scheduled for separation so that efforts are made to expedite completion of
the ROS investigation. 14 CPTS/FMF will be notified of impending debt.

              14.4.2.4. Persons who have lost, damaged, or destroyed government property
              valued at $500 or less may voluntarily pay for the property IAW AFMAN 23-220
              paragraphs 14.4 and 16.1.
              16.1.6.4. If the responsible individual(s) elects to make voluntary payment for the
              lost/damaged/destroyed property, the Wing ROS manager prepares DD Form 362,
              Statement of Charges/Cash Collection Voucher or DD Form 1131, Cash
              Collection Voucher. Voluntary payment documents must contain the statement,
              “Used in lieu of a ROS”. The responsible individual coordinates with 14
              CPTS/FMF for processing. 14 CPTS/FMF ensures the ROS manager obtains a
              copy of final payment. ROS manager provides a copy to the applicable agencies,
              e.g. Wing Information Technology Equipment Custodian Officer, Equipment
              Accountability Office, Land Mobile Radio Officer, etc.
