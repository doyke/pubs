SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This publication adds and clearly defines additional roles and responsibilities for key wing
personnel.

Organizational chart to the Family Advocacy Office upon request.

family maltreatment to the FAO.
1.6.1.13. (Added) (45SW) Activates the CSMRT when allegations of child sexual maltreatment
are received. FAP will not conduct family interviews until the CSMRT has determined the best
response for the case. "Just-in-time" training will be held at the beginning of each CSMRT
activation to ensure members are current in their knowledge of the responsibilities of the
CSMRT and their respective roles.
1.6.1.13.1. (Added) (45SW) Activates the CSMRT in response to allegations of child sexual
maltreatment in DoD-sanctioned facilities and ensures immediate notification to the 45
MDG/CC. Completes and forwards the high interest worksheet to HQ FAP within 24 hours.
1.6.1.14. (Added) (45SW) Activates the HRVRT when there is concern that family members
may be in imminent danger of harm from other family members or a FAP staff member may be
in imminent danger from a current or former FAP client. "Just-in-time" training will be held at
the beginning of each HRVRT activation to ensure members are current in their knowledge of
the responsibilities of the HRVRT and their respective roles.
1.6.1.14.1. (Added) (45SW) Activates the HRVRT in response to allegations of death due to
maltreatment and ensures immediate notification to the 45 MDG/CC. Completes and forwards

of partner violence, an initial 72-hour No Contact Order should be given to the active duty
member to ensure the opportunity to coordinate with the Family Advocacy Office for assessment
and further safety planning. If the active duty member is the alleged victim, it may be reasonable
to coordinate with the SF and JA to determine if a temporary barment from base of a civilian
offender is warranted. In cases of child maltreatment allegations, the CC/CCF will verify that
the Florida Department of Children and Families has been notified and will ensure that the
member cooperates with the investigation. Commanders will support/enforce "no contact
orders" issued by civilian authorities.

the First Sergeant roster to the Family Advocacy Intervention Specialist on a monthly basis.

guidance on notification requirements.).
