sonnel involved in the day-to-day management of the AMC Reserve Associate Program. Subsequent ref-
erences to Air Force Reserve Associate personnel, units, etc., will be referred to as "Reserve Associate
personnel, units, etc."
NOTE: Certain Air Force Reserve organic units are collocated with, supported and commanded by
Reserve Associate Wing Commanders. Such units as aerial port squadrons, civil engineering squadrons
(except Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Flights), and other similar organizations are not governed
by this instruction.

1.2. Background:
    1.2.1. The objective of the Air Force Reserve associate program is to provide trained personnel to be
    the initial and primary source of augmentation of the active forces in any emergency requiring rapid
    and sustaining expansion of the strategic airlift and air refueling capabilities. Additionally, the Air
    Force Reserve associate units perform peacetime missions as an adjunct to, or corollary of, training.
    AMC and AFRC, respectively, must ensure that the active duty host and Air Force Reserve associate
    units are indoctrinated and trained to achieve this objective.
    1.2.2. The Reserve associate units use aircraft, training equipment, aerospace ground equipment,
    facilities, and spares with the active duty wings. Augmentation by these Reserve Associate units will
    ensure full utilization of AMC aircraft under full mobilization. The Reserve Associate unit Air
    Reserve Technician (ART) maintenance complement is authorized manpower to train traditional
    reservists and to provide aircraft production capability in support of active duty and Reserve flying
    hour requirements.

1.3. Regulation Revision. The Headquarters AMC/AFRC staff agency listed as the OPR for each chap-
ter will be responsible for maintaining the validity and currency of its respective chapter. Revisions will
be processed and published as stated in paragraph 2.6.

1.4. Explanation of Terms:
    1.4.1. Reserve Associate Units. Organized Air Force Reserve (AFRC) units collocated with an active
    AMC wing. The Reserve Associate units use aircraft, equipment, and facilities of the collocated
    active AMC wing.
    1.4.2. Host Wing. Active AMC wing with which the Reserve Associate unit is collocated.
    1.4.3. Air Reserve Technician (ART). A full-time AFRC civil service employee assigned to an Asso-
    ciate unit, and a member of the Air Force Reserve with a Reserve assignment on the unit manpower
    document (UMD) of the Reserve Associate unit. The primary duties of the ART are to maintain a
    full-time unit management structure, provide support to the peacetime utilization rate, and to train
    other assigned Reserve personnel, all of which are to ensure unit readiness and productivity. Details
    of ART duties and requirements are provided in other chapters of this instruction.
AMCI36-2602 7 FEBRUARY 2005                                                                                7


   1.4.4. Traditional Reservist. Non-ART member of the Air Force Reserve, available for active duty
   service if mobilized.
   1.4.5. Civil Service Employee/Non-ART. For the purpose of this regulation, a civilian employee
   (non-ART) of the Associate unit who is not a traditional reservist and is not subject to mobilization
   with the Reserve associate unit.
   1.4.6. Operational Control. The authority to perform those functions of command over subordinate
   forces involving organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objec-
   tives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control
   includes authoritative direction over all aspects of military operations and joint training necessary to
   accomplish missions assigned to the command
   1.4.7. Administrative Control. Direction or exercise of authority over subordinate or other organiza-
   tions in respect to administration and support, including organization of Service forces, control of
   resources and equipment, personnel management, unit logistics, individual and unit training, readi-
   ness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and other matters not included in the operational mis-
   sions of the subordinate or other organizations.
NOTE: Chapter 8 outlines basic policies and procedures applicable to the delegation of responsibilities
associated with administrative control.
   1.4.8. Availability. A period of time determined by reservists during which they may be absent from
   their civilian occupation and present for training with the Reserve associate unit. All training activi-
   ties (including AMC tasked tanker/airlift missions) must be planned to ensure return to home base
   within the allotted time.
   1.4.9. Activation. The process of placing members of the selected reserves on active duty. Activation
   includes all forms of mobilization and service under the Presidential Selected Reserve Call-up as well
   as consensual, or voluntary, service under 10 U.S.C. 12301 (formerly 672d), generally referred to as
   volunteerism. The term nonmobilized is understood to be the opposite of activated; i.e., peacetime
   duty or training in the form of inactive duty for training, annual tours, additional flying training peri-
   ods or proficiency training and school tours.

1.5. Concept of Operations:
   1.5.1. The Reserve associate concept establishes Reserve units, without unit aircraft or equipment,
   collocated with active AMC units. These units share aircraft, equipment, vehicles, and other facilities
   of the active unit. They are composed of traditional reservists, civil service employees, and ARTs.
   Command and administrative control remain with the Reserve associate unit commander. When
   mobilized, Reserve associate unit personnel will maintain unit identity and will continue to fully inte-
   grate with the active duty mission effort. When activated under less than full mobilization, adminis-
   trative control will remain with the Reserve associate squadron, while operational control passes to
   the gaining MAJCOM. Under full mobilization, Reserve associate forces will be placed under opera-
   tional and administrative control of the active duty Air Force. Reserve associate personnel will
   occupy positions according to their proficiency and/or capability within functional areas.
   1.5.2. The Reserve associate aircrews and EOD teams will be qualified IAW USAF and AMC stan-
   dards. When Reserve associate crew members are used on an individual basis, each will be assigned
   crew duties commensurate with his/her qualifications, including pilot-in-command of a crew contain-
   ing active personnel.

    tional readiness to include scheduling and coordinating training requirements.
    1.6.4. Members of a Reserve associate unit on Active Duty Training (ADT) and Inactive Duty Train-
    ing (IDT) are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Jurisdiction for military jus-
    tice and administrative actions rests, primarily, with AFRC.
    1.6.5. Upon activation, operational control of personnel assigned to the AMC-gained Reserve associ-
    ate units transfers to AMC/CC. Administrative control remains with the Reserve associate unit Com-
    mander.

1.7. Channels of Communication:
    1.7.1. Members of Reserve associate units will communicate with counterpart members of the host
    unit. Correspondence related specifically to Reserve associate policy matters will be routed through

                                                 Chapter 3

                     FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND COMPTROLLER (A8)

3.1. General. Responsibilities of financial management and comptroller organizations at AMC wings are
specified in AMCI 65-601, AMC Financial Management for Operations. This chapter explains comptrol-
ler responsibilities of the active force and of the Reserve force as they relate to the Reserve Associate Pro-
gram.

3.2. Objectives. The financial management and comptroller position for this program is based on
requirements established by Public Law and the directives of OSD and USAF for compliance with the
law. Objectives in the financial management and comptroller area are delineation of funding responsibil-
ities and identification of required financial management and comptroller support.
     3.2.1. The first objective, delineation of funding responsibility, has two aspects. In the first, the
     Reserve associate unit is under command of AFRC which is hosted by an AMC base. The parent
     organization funds those expenses which are directly related to AFRC. Host operations and mainte-
     nance (O&M) funds will be used to support AFRC tenant units consistent with the general funding
     guidance prescribed in Chapter 7, Section 7B—Intraservice Relationships (Within the Air Force), as
     well as the specific terms contained in the support agreement between the host AMC base and the ten-
     ant Reserve associate unit. AMC bases fund all base operating support costs for Reserve associate
     units in the same manner as it provides for its host units while the Reserve associate units fund for any
     unique requirements specific to their mission.
     3.2.2. The second objective, identification of required financial management and comptroller support,
     is discussed in subsequent paragraphs.

3.3. Training. AMC wing financial management and comptrollers will ensure that training is given as
required by AFI 10-301 and AMCI 36-2604 (AMC Advisors to the Air Reserve Components (forthcom-
ing)).

3.4. Budget. AMC financial management and comptrollers will ensure that the requirements of the
Reserve associate units which are the financial responsibility of the active force are budgeted and funded
on an equitable basis. The Reserve associate unit has a civilian employee who performs the budget func-
tion for the AFRC area of responsibility. Fund source for expenses arising from the Reserve associate unit
concept will be as follows:
     3.4.1. Pay of Personnel:
        3.4.1.1. Reserve Personnel Appropriation (RPA) provides funds for pay, allowances, uniform
        clothing, subsistence, etc., of Reserve Associate members. Pay and allowances are charged to this
        appropriation for all inactive duty training periods and annual tours, special tours of active duty
        for training using RPA man-days, and tours to attend TTU training courses or courses under the
        Air Force Training Program. Detailed guidance is provided in AFMAN 36-8001; DFAS-DEM
        7073, Volume 3, Defense Joint Military Pay System—Reserve Component (DJMS-RC) and the
        DoD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlement Manual. Reserve associate members cannot qual-
        ify for pay for more than two periods of inactive duty training during a single calendar day. For
        AFTPs, a flight must be made during each AFTP.
AMCI36-2602 7 FEBRUARY 2005                                                                            15


       3.4.1.2. Military personnel appropriation (MPA), Air Force, funds the pay and allowances of
       Associate members who are ordered to special tours of active duty using MPA mandays (these are
       tours other than for training, even one day). Use of this appropriation is controlled by
       Headquarters USAF through allocation of active duty man-days and the "Reserve Personnel
       Report of Special Tours of Active Duty Chargeable to Military Personnel Appropriation," RCS:
       HAF-MPP(M)7115, both of which are the responsibility of HQ AMC/A1. Charges to this appro-
       priation include flying pay, subsistence, etc., applicable to the period of active duty.
       3.4.1.3. Pay and benefits of Air Reserve Technicians (ART), including minimal ART overtime at
       the discretion of the Associate unit commander, regularly scheduled ART holiday work, and other
       civilian employees of the Reserve associate unit are funded by AFRC. Funding of overtime, hol-
       iday work, and TDY include the following considerations:
          3.4.1.3.1. Approval of the senior ART. With discretion, the senior ART may further delegate
          this authority to the executive officer and/or the highest grade civilian employee (ART or
          non-ART) in the O&M function.
          3.4.1.3.2. Availability of funds.
          3.4.1.3.3. Compliance with funding policy of AFRC and AMC.
              3.4.1.3.3.1. Policy. AMC will reimburse AFRC for overtime and holiday work under the
              following circumstances:
                  3.4.1.3.3.1.1. Overtime Work/Pay. This is defined as maintenance overtime per-
                  formed by AFRC ARTs specifically in support of AMC aircraft when requested by the
                  AMC host logistics group commander. Overtime performed by AFRC ART personnel
                  for those aircraft maintenance activities which benefit AFRC will continue to be
                  funded by AFRC on a nonreimbursable basis, for example, overtime associated with
                  Reserve associate training activities, joint operational readiness inspections, etc. AMC
                  reimbursable overtime should not be used in lieu of available MPA man-days. All
                  overtime payment to ART personnel, other than those assigned to aircraft maintenance
                  functions, will continue to be the funding responsibility of AFRC. EXCEPTION:
                  Host unit will recompense for all overtime as a result of duty performed by civilian/
                  ART employees in direct support of the Host Wing/Group. Request can be made by
                  other than host Logistics Group Commander if work falls outside the logistics arena.
                  Requester must be authorized by the host commander.
                  3.4.1.3.3.1.2. Holiday Work/Pay. When the previously planned personnel work
                  schedule for a holiday is inadequate due to some unexpected workload and additional
                  ARTs are required to work the holiday, the holiday pay for these additional ARTs will
                  be funded by AMC.
NOTE: This will not include the ARTs who were scheduled to work the holiday as part of a reduced or
normal work force within their scheduled work week. AFRC ART personnel are an integral part of the
maintenance work force and therefore must be considered when scheduling the work force for legal holi-
days.
              3.4.1.3.3.2. Procedure. When Reserve associate personnel work overtime or on holidays
              in support of AMC missions as outlined in 3.4.1.3., the following procedures will be used:
16                                                                    AMCI36-2602 7 FEBRUARY 2005


                      3.4.1.3.3.2.1. Host designated representative (applicable group commander or desig-
                      nated representative) AMC is the requester and initiates the action.
                      3.4.1.3.3.2.2. Justification on AF Form 428, Request for Overtime, Holiday Pre-
                      mium Pay, and Compensatory Time, explains the need for overtime or holiday pay
                      and indicates the responsibility center/cost center (RC/CC) or the AMC unit to be
                      charged.
                      3.4.1.3.3.2.3. The senior ART or designated personnel (restricted to those listed in
                      paragraph 3.4.1.3.1.) is the approving authority.
                      3.4.1.3.3.2.4. Financial Service Office certifies the AFRC fund availability.
                      3.4.1.3.3.2.5. For AFRC budget preparation, AMC activities will assist the AFRC
                      Associate budget officer in estimating the amount of reimbursable premium pay for
                      overtime or holiday work planned.
                      3.4.1.3.3.2.6. AFRC will budget reimbursable AFRC O&M funds to support the indi-
                      cated AMC workload in sales code 50A (TWCF).
                      3.4.1.3.3.2.7. AMC bases will provide TDY funding for Associate Reserve personnel
                      on MPA mandays. These funds will be included in the base budget submission to HQ
                      AMC. See AMC supplement 1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Pro-
                      cedures, chapter 10, paragraphs 10.2.1.1.2.1 and 10.2.1.1.2.2 on TDY funding guid-
                      ance for Reserve associate units who request MPA mandays from HQ AMC.
     3.4.2. Quarters. Where on-base facilities are available, the AMC host base will make such facilities
     available to the Associate unit. Contract billeting may be provided for Reserve associate unit person-
     nel who cannot be accommodated on base.
     3.4.3. Travel:
        3.4.3.1. Travel pay between home and duty station is not authorized for Associate personnel per-
        forming inactive duty training according to Joint Federal Travel Regulations (JFTR), chapter 7,
        part G, and paragraph U7150C.2.
        3.4.3.2. Entitlement to travel pay between home and duty station for Reserve associate personnel
        who are on active duty for training, or annual training duty, is explained in JFTR, chapter 7, part
        G, and paragraph U7150A. When authorized, this expense is chargeable to RPA.
        3.4.3.3. Reserve associate personnel who are ordered to active duty and receive pay from MPA as
        outlined in paragraph 3.4.1.2. will be funded by AMC for travel pay, when authorized, for travel
        from home to duty station and return.
        3.4.3.4. Reserve associate personnel who perform Reserve training at a location other than the
        home station of their Reserve associate unit are entitled to travel pay regardless of whether they
        are on inactive duty training status, active duty for training (including annual training duty), or on
        a short tour of active duty. RPA is used for TDY expenses of unit personnel attending TTU train-
        ing courses, or for personnel directed to attend courses under the Air Force Training Program.
        AFRC funds the TDY expenses for unit personnel performing staff visits, attending conferences in
        connection with Air Force Reserve matters, and for crew personnel performing training flights.
        AMC funds, from the TWCF, C-5/C-17 crew TDY for Associate personnel who perform TWCF
        missions as basic or augmented crew members. AMC funds, from O&M 3400, KC-10/KC-135

     crew TDY for Reserve associate personnel who perform AMC missions as basic or augmented
     crew members. This includes cost of returning Reserve associate personnel crew members to unit
     of assignment when unexpected delays would cause their normal return to be extended beyond the
     tour termination date. TWCF also funds the TDY of C-5/C-17 Reserve associate unit mainte-
     nance personnel and AMC O&M 3400 funds the KC-10/KC-135 Reserve associate maintenance
     personnel who may be required to perform emergency service on these AMC-assigned aircraft
     away from home station.
  3.4.4. Facilities. Construction, initial alteration, or rehabilitation of facilities for sole use of the
  Reserve associate unit are funded by AFRC. If rehabilitation can be done in-house for the Reserve
  associate unit, the cost, if $2,000 or less, is charged to AMC appropriated funds together with the
  O&M costs of the sole use facility; if more than $2,000, the cost is charged to AFRC.
  3.4.5. Supplies and Equipment:
     3.4.5.1. AFRC funds all administrative supplies and equipment requisitioned by Reserve associ-
     ate units, items issued to the Reserve associate unit for training purposes, and equipment manage-
     ment office (EMO)-controlled expense equipment, including personal equipment and hand tools.
     3.4.5.2. AMC funds the expenses resulting from operation, maintenance, and support of TWCF
     aircraft.
  3.4.6. Utilities. AMC host wing will give the same utilities support as furnished to every other Air
  Force tenant funded by AMC O&M appropriation.
  3.4.7. Communications. Common user services will be funded by AMC appropriated funds. Long
  distance tolls and communications systems peculiar to AFRC are funded by AFRC.
  3.4.8. Rental of Equipment. Rental charge of equipment which is supplemental to equipment on
  AMC host equipment authorization inventory data (EAID), and supporting the AMC mission, is
  funded by AMC appropriation. Rental charge for equipment, which is supplemental to AFRC EAID,
  and supporting the AFRC mission is AFRC-funded.
  3.4.9. Vehicle Rentals. If a vehicle is rented to supplement AMC vehicle authorization, AMC funds
  are cited. Headquarters AFRC has funding responsibility for rental of vehicles supplementing AFRC
  vehicle authorization.
  3.4.10. Contract Maintenance of Equipment. Funding for maintenance of equipment performed by
  contract will be IAW the provisions of AFI 65-601, volume I; chapter 7, paragraph 7.5.5
  3.4.11. Host Support. AMC is responsible for providing the following support on a non reimbursable
  basis:
     3.4.11.1. Common base support.
     3.4.11.2. Data automation support required by the Reserve associate unit.
  3.4.12. At the direction of Commander, Air Force Reserve, AFRC reimburses AMC for the pro-
  grammed unilateral training portion of the approved Reserve Associate flying hour program. Billing

     ing to KC-10/KC-135 Reserve associate units on AMC bases only when the overtime is necessary as
     a direct result of AMC taskings. When computing reimbursement for ART overtime, the DFAS
     Omaha field site civilian payroll section matches the actual overtime hours worked by ART personnel
     with the approved AF Form 428 and, at the end of each payroll period, manually tabulates the
     amounts by RC/CC to be reimbursed from AMC to AFRC funds and processes the SF 1080, Voucher
     for Transfers Between Appropriations and/or Funds.

3.6. Mobilization Procedures. Financial management and comptroller procedures will be incorporated
in the mobilization plan prepared IAW AFI 10-402. These procedures will be consistent with the provi-
sions of the 17X-series of Air Force directives, AFI 10-402, AFI 10-221, Contingency and Wartime
Deployable Airfield Operations Management, and AFMAN 10-401, Operation Plan and Concept Plan
Development. See AMC Supplement 1 to AFI 65-601, Volume 1, chapter 10, paragraph 10.2.1.2.5

AMCI36-2602 7 FEBRUARY 2005                                                                              19


                                               Chapter 4

                                          OPERATIONS (A3)

4.1. General:
   4.1.1. The responsibility for recruiting and training qualified aircrew personnel rests with the Reserve
   associate unit commander. The responsibility for training is shared by the commander of the host wing
   (AMC); this support is the only means available to the Reserve associate unit commander for attaining
   and maintaining operational readiness.
   4.1.2. Scheduling of training and AMC tasked tanker/airlift missions for Reserve associate crew
   members will be done by the Reserve associate unit in coordination with the active wing and subordi-
   nate units of both wings. The active wing and TACC will attempt to provide stability to the Reserve
   associate schedule. When surge/contingency situations require increased flight operations (above the
   approved program rate for Reserve associate units), such increases, when within the capability of the
   Reserve associate unit to support, may be supported, provided budgeting and funding is IAW AFI
   10-301. Recognizing the Reserve associate flying hour/utilization rate is at a minimum for maintain-
   ing operational ready status, any actions which might reduce these hours must have prior coordination
   with AFRC.
   4.1.3. Reserve associate aircrew personnel may be assigned flight duties on an individual basis as a
   member of a mixed aircrew (part active and part Reserve associate) or constitute a complete aircrew.
   4.1.4. Reserve associate aircrew personnel available for weekend/evening training will be scheduled
   to optimize these periods of availability. Missions/flights will be scheduled to coincide with periods
   of Reserve associate aircrew availability and will be published accordingly in the wing flying sched-
   ule.
   4.1.5. Reserve associate unit will determine the number of local training flights/sorties and AMC
   tasked tanker/airlift /air evac missions necessary to initially train and maintain assigned aircrews in a
   current and proficient state in order to fulfill the unit’s mobilization role. The Reserve associate unit
   will submit requirements to the host wing in writing on a regular basis.
   4.1.6. The TACC is responsible for the effective management of aircrews when under their opera-
   tional control. An element of that responsibility is the efficient use of Reserve associate aircrew per-
   sonnel during their periods of availability. There is no guarantee that missions will always be
   completed at scheduled Mission End Time (MET). Therefore, it is incumbent upon Reserve associate
   crew members to make available sufficient time to accommodate unavoidable delays in returning to
   home station. Scheduled Return Time (SRT) will be the same as MET. SRT(s) for contingencies and
   missions of unknown duration will be determined by TACC in coordination with HQ AFRC. For
   stages, crew SRT(s) will be computed using the known ground times at stage locations. Twenty-four
   hours ground time will be used in those instances where the duration of stage ground times is
   unknown. SRT will be determined and placed on the flight authorization. The overall objective is to
   recover aircrews on schedule and provide scheduling stability. Two essential ingredients for this con-
   cept are realistic determination of SRT(s) based on mission duration and conscientious management
   by the TACC to ensure return of aircrews by MET. Except in uncontrollable or unusual circum-
   stances, Reserve associate crew members must be assured that their missions will be completed within
   the SRT. The Reserve associate aircraft commander will be provided a copy of mission itinerary
   changes. Delays in return of Reserve associate aircrew personnel beyond their SRT will be coordi-
20                                                                  AMCI36-2602 7 FEBRUARY 2005


     nated by the TACC and concurred with by the aircrew and the operating Reserve associate unit.
     Replacement crew members will be coordinated by TACC. The return of Reserve associate crew
     members to home station to meet the SRT will be IAW AMCI 11-206, Mobility Force Management
     and AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operation. If the SRT cannot be met by these provisions, and the
     Reserve associate aircrew (or members) cannot extend past the SRT, the TACC will verify whether
     military or contract means of transportation is available. If no such means is available, the TACC will
     request authority through channels from the Reserve associate unit to return the crew members to
     home station by the most expeditious means (see chapter 3 for funding provisions).
     4.1.7. Headquarters AFRC will provide the necessary man-days of active duty and inactive duty
     training periods and additional flying training periods to assure Reserve associate aircrew currency/
     proficiency. Budgeting and funding support for Reserve associate unit aircrews operating active force
     aircraft when augmenting the active force beyond the above mentioned prescribed drill periods will be
     IAW AFI 10-301.
     4.1.8. Reserve associate commanders will provide sufficient aircrew coverage to assure the unit's pro-
     grammed aircraft flying hour allocations are accomplished. The host wing commander will ensure
     that the Reserve associate unit is given sufficient AMC tasked tanker/airlift/training missions to meet
     the flying hour allocation, meet training objectives, and maintain aircrew currency.
     4.1.9. Insofar as practical, schedule maximum aircrew training in conjunction with airlift of Reserve
     associate and aeromedical evacuation crew members when such airlift is performed within the flying
     hours reimbursed by AFRC.

4.2. Readiness. Reserve associate units are responsible for achieving AMC-established training stan-
dards IAW AFI 10-301. The commander of the AMC host wing shares this responsibility with the
Reserve associate commander inasmuch as total support is the only means available to the Reserve asso-
ciate unit to attain and maintain operational readiness. Wartime readiness of the active and Reserve asso-
ciate units is dependent on both the active and Reserve associate operational capability. The day-to-day
combat readiness of active and Reserve associate units is measured separately by using the Status of
Resources and Training Systems Report (SORTS) as set forth in Joint Pub 1-03.3, Joint Reporting Struc-
ture Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS), and AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training
System. These publications are supplemented by AMC and AFRC, and provide the instructions for
reporting unit readiness.

4.3. Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation:
     4.3.1. Concept. Standard policies and procedures will be used by each Associate unit IAW current
     Air Force, AMC, and AMCI-series directives, as reviewed and approved by Headquarters AFRC IAW
     AFI 10-301. The aircrew standardization/evaluation program is directed toward obtaining quality air-
     crew performance and maintaining unit capability at the highest possible state of readiness.
     4.3.2. Reserve Associate Responsibilities. One ART for each crew position, per assigned weapons
     system, flight examiner qualified, will be assigned the aircrew standardization/evaluation responsibil-
     ity within each Reserve associate operations group. The ART is normally assigned at the group level,
     but may be at the squadron level when only one squadron exists. Squadron positions will be assigned
     as an additional duty. Selection, qualification, and duties will be in accordance with AFI 11-202 Vol
     2 and AMC Sup 1, Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Program. The use of a Reserve associate
     nurse for squadron standardization is authorized in those squadrons assigned a primary medical mis-
AMCI36-2602 7 FEBRUARY 2005                                                                              21


   sion. The ARTs performing additional duties as aircrew standardization/evaluation crew members
   within each wing/group/squadron will serve as an advisor to the unit commander for all matters per-
   taining to aircrew standardization/evaluation.
   4.3.3. AMC Responsibilities. AMC will monitor the Reserve associate aircrew standardization/eval-
   uation program to ensure standards of qualification and proficiency are maintained.
   4.3.4. Reserve associate wing will have overall responsibility for its standardization/evaluation pro-
   gram. Conduct flight evaluations IAW AFI 11-202 V2/AMC 1. Copies of all correspondence involv-
   ing aircrew readiness will be sent to the appropriate NAF/DO and AFRC/DOT.
       4.3.4.1. Staff Assistance Visits. The host wing aircrew standardization officer will ensure that a
       staff assistance visit is made upon request of the associate unit. Units will send copies of all cor-
       respondence involving aircrew readiness issues to the appropriate NAF/DO and AFRC/DOT.
   4.3.5. Aircrew Member Certification Board. The Reserve associate squadron will certify crew mem-
   bers in accordance with AFI 11-202 V2/AMC 1. Final certification for aircraft commanders and flight
   examiners will be performed by the Reserve Associate Wing/Group commander.
   4.3.6. Reporting: Reserve Associate units are responsible for reporting aircrew standardization/eval-
   uation data IAW AFI 11-202 V2/AMC 1.

4.4. Aircrew Training. AFRC/CC will ensure that training is conducted in accordance with those por-
tions of AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1s (e.g., AFI 11-2C-17 Vol 1, C-17 Aircrew Training). To avoid duplica-
tion and most effectively use existing programs, consolidated training will be done whenever possible.
   4.4.1. Formal School. All aircrew members will meet the basic requirements as outlined in applicable
   AFI 11-MDS Series publications. Initial Qualification training, Mission Qualification and Upgrade
   Training, and Continuation Training, will be conducted in accordance with these directives.
   4.4.2. Annual simulator training for pilots, navigators, and flight engineers will be provided by civil-
   ian contracted agencies as provided for by HQ AMC.
   4.4.3. AFRC will provide HQ AMC/A11E and HQ AMC/A37TF with the necessary data to establish
   quotas at AMC formal schools. Data will include requirements for newly activated units and the
   training of additional aircrews due to attrition from units previously activated.
       4.4.3.1. AMC formal school quotas will be controlled and assigned by HQ AMC/A11ET IAW
       AMCI 36-2204, AMC Major Command (MAJCOM) Mission Training Program. All Reserve for-
       mal school quotas will be forwarded to HQ AFRC/DOT for distribution to subordinate units.
       4.4.3.2. Quotas assigned to Reserve associate units must be filled 30 days prior to scheduled class
       start date per agreement with AFRC/DOT. If not filled, quotas will be offered to other units.
   4.4.4. Incremental training, as specified in AFI 36-2115, Assignments Within the Reserve Compo-
   nents, is authorized for Reserve associate unit personnel.
   4.4.5. AFRC will make man-days/other resources available to ensure that annual currency require-
   ments other than flying are accomplished.
   4.4.6. A consolidated unit training program will be used to the maximum extent to reduce duplication
   and provide for the most effective use of existing programs, facilities, and equipment.

                                                 Chapter 6

                                          MAINTENANCE (A4)

6.1. Purpose. This chapter provides standardized organization and management instructions applicable
to and directive on all AMC and AFRC Maintenance Groups and subordinate squadrons which operate
together as associated units. These organizations will work together as an integrated, Total Force team
operating seamlessly on flight lines, in shops and offices to maintain Air Mobility aircraft, optimize main-
tenance production, generate aircraft to meet mission tasking, and manage/allocate resources across their
respective active/associate wings. When activated, Reserve associate Maintenance Group personnel,
even though not mobilized as a unit, will maintain unit identity and will continue to fully integrate into the
active duty maintenance production effort. When activated under less than full mobilization, administra-
tive control will remain with the Reserve associate squadron, while operational control passes to the
active duty commander. Under full mobilization, Reserve associate forces will be placed under opera-
tional and administrative control of the active duty Air Force.

6.2. Organizational Concept. AMC and AFRC Maintenance Groups, with their subordinate squadrons,
will be structured as independent, mirrored organizations to the extent possible given authorized man-
power and mandated functional responsibilities. AMC and AFRC aircraft maintenance commanders,
managers, and supervisors will exercise the full range of command, personnel management, performance
review, career development, and administrative support responsibilities for members of their respective
units. The work center supervisor, whether active duty, ART, civilian, or traditional reservist, is empow-
ered to assign tasks. AMC and AFRC (ART and traditional reservist) aircraft maintenance personnel will
be trained, tasked, and employed as a unified team to meet mission tasking.
   6.2.1. Civilian performance appraisals, military performance reports, and other administrative and
   personnel management functions will be the responsibility of supervisors and commanders within the
   respective chain of command. Active duty supervisors and commanders will perform these functions
   for active duty personnel. Similarly, Associate Reserve supervisors and commanders will perform
   these functions for Associate Reserve personnel.
   6.2.2. Reserve associate units will be collocated with active duty units as facilities allow. When facil-
   ities do not permit collocation, every effort will be made to ensure long-term planning includes ade-
   quate space for this collocation. The intent of this collocation is to facilitate an integrated active duty
   and Reserve supervisory structure to plan and coordinate the processes necessary to accomplish
   launch, recovery, and repair of aircraft, while at the same time preserving the Reserve supervisory
   responsibility for the training of Reserve personnel.
   6.2.3. Within the AMC aircraft maintenance complex, work center supervisors and assistant work
   center supervisors may be ART, active duty, Reserve, or civilian. The establishment and designation
   of these positions will be by agreement between the AMC and AFRC Maintenance Group Command-
   ers.
       6.2.3.1. Each work center supervisor has full functional control over all personnel assigned to his/
       her area of responsibility, including active and Reserve associate, military and civilian. However,
       the supervision of traditional reservists present for training remains the responsibility of the senior
       reservist assigned to that work center, including reservists performing equivalent training.
       Reserve trainers will be assigned to work the same shift as their assigned trainees.
28                                                                    AMCI36-2602 7 FEBRUARY 2005


        6.2.3.2. Branch and work center Reserve associate personnel will assume control over assigned
        reservists during monthly UTAs. However, prior to UTAs, Associate personnel will coordinate
        with work center supervisors on what maintenance tasks are to be done during the UTA in con-
        junction with scheduled training. Advanced planning is the key factor to ensure reservists are
        given meaningful jobs during each UTA. Senior Reserve associate personnel in each work area
        are ultimately responsible to the work center supervisor for the accomplishment of assigned main-
        tenance tasks.
     6.2.4. Reserve squadrons will share production equipment, tools, personnel equipment, bench stocks,
     and radios. AMC unit commanders will ensure appropriate and equivalent work space, office space,
     desk space, etc., is available for the use of ART personnel in civilian status performing their daily
     functional responsibilities within AMC facilities.
     6.2.5. Dedicated Crew Chiefs (DCC) will be drawn from a combined pool of AMC and Reserve asso-
     ciate personnel. The exact level of DCC representation and designation will be locally determined
     based on a proportional ratio of active duty and Reserve associate personnel at the grade and skill lev-
     els required to perform these duties.
     6.2.6. The flexible participation of traditional reservists throughout the work week and on varying
     shifts is a highly desired objective. This objective will be achieved by the flexible scheduling of
     UTAs and the use of annual tours and RPA/MPA man-days.
     6.2.7. Daily, weekly, and long-term planning and execution of production and training events is a
     shared responsibility to be conducted at the lowest possible and practical level. Production and train-
     ing are joint and shared responsibilities of all supervisors, managers, and commanders, whatever their
     affiliation, component, or status. Production plans and tasking will be developed and executed on the
     basis of the mission of the combined parent wings. Wing training, qualification, and proficiency pro-
     grams will be developed and executed based on the requirements of all personnel (active duty, ART,
     and traditional reservists).
     6.2.8. Active duty, ART, and traditional reservists will be assigned production and training tasks as
     integrated teams where possible. Selection of personnel for production tasking will be based on
     supervisors assessments of production and training requirements and individual qualifications. Teams
     will be assigned immediately after roll call. Teams will not be formed using component affiliation as
     the sole or primary criterion. Team chiefs will be designated on the basis of rank, qualification, and
     experience.

6.3. Joint Responsibilities. Each objective listed below is a joint responsibility of the host (AMC) wing
Maintenance Group Commander, the Reserve associate Maintenance Group Commander/Senior ART,
and their subordinate commanders, managers, and supervisors. These responsibilities will be discharged
with the full coordination and cooperation of these senior leaders.
     6.3.1. Qualification and proficiency training of all assigned personnel (active duty, traditional reserv-
     ists, and ARTs) is a joint responsibility of the AMC and AFRC Maintenance Group Commanders and
     their subordinate commanders. All personnel will be trained to AF standards using host wing equip-
     ment and AF/AMC procedures, media, and methods to meet AMC proficiency criteria. Trainees will
     be formally assigned designated OJT trainers from their own squadrons. They may, however, receive
     task instruction from any qualified trainer, regardless of component, designated by their supervisor.
     Training will be IAW applicable Air Force, AMC, and AFRC directives. ART personnel will be

   allowed sufficient time to prepare for Reserve training. AMC and associate reserve units will support
   a unified maintenance qualification and training program (MQTP), to include instructors.
   6.3.2. Active duty and Associate Maintenance Group Commanders and their subordinate command-
   ers will organize/allocate aircraft maintenance resources and will manage and control these resources.
   They will manage aircraft maintenance functions to ensure successful mission (AMC and AFRC,
   peacetime and wartime) accomplishment. They will also:

       tions.
       6.3.2.2. Review UMDs annually to ensure all personnel are assigned to and working in the exact
       position authorized.
       6.3.2.3. Ensure that when uncommon tours of duty (includes Saturday and Sunday) and/or shift
       work are required, the level of ART authorizations assigned to these tours/shifts will reflect their
       proportionate fair share of the individual squadron force. Deviations are permitted during peak
       workloads, unusual mission requirements, or as agreed upon by the AMC and Reserve Associate
       Maintenance Group Commanders.
   6.3.3. Except as agreed upon by the AMC and Reserve associate Maintenance Group Commanders/
   Senior ART, key ART officers and squadron superintendents will be assigned to a standard day-shift
   schedule within their respective functional areas. With the concurrence of Reserve Associate Mainte-
   nance Group Commander/Senior ART, AMC unit commanders may temporarily require ART person-
   nel to serve on alternative shifts or in alternative functional areas during periods of increased
   readiness, surges, peak workloads, etc.
   6.3.4. Key AMC and Reserve Associate supervisory personnel will conduct periodic meetings to
   ensure cross-tell of information, discussion, and resolution of mutual problems.
   6.3.5. Duties and responsibilities of 2SOXX ART personnel assigned within the Maintenance Group
   will be that of Decentralized Supply Support (DSS) as identified in AMCI 23-101, Instruction for
   Decentralized Supply Support. The designated supervisor within DSS will maintain individual
   AF Forms 971, Supervisor's Employee Brief. The Maintenance Operations Squadron commander/
   senior ART will be the AF Form 860, Civilian Performance and Promotion Appraisal - Perfor-
   mance Plan, reporting official. Authorizations will be placed in FAC 2120C0 and given organiza-
   tional structure code (OSC) MXOS. Reserve command/control and administrative support remain a
   responsibility of the Associate Maintenance Group Commander/Senior ART.

6.4. Reserve Associate Maintenance Support Responsibilities. The Reserve Associate Maintenance

        the Reserve associate unit MPF, and scheduled by the host base MPF. ART and non-ART Reserv-
        ist training quotas are jointly scheduled by the host wing and Reserve associate unit maintenance
        training managers using AFRC funds. The Reserve associate unit MPF will obtain formal school
        training quotas for non-ART Reservists. AFRC approval must be obtained for training funds to
        include associate TDY, travel, and/or overtime costs as required.
     6.6.8. The conduct and supervision of Reserve associate unit maintenance training is the responsibil-
     ity of the Reserve associate unit.
     6.6.9. USAF, AMC, AFRC, contractor, as well as locally developed training media will be used for
     Reserve associate maintenance technical training. Maximum use will be made of the host unit level
     learning center. Procedures are listed in MCR 66-4, Contract Quality Assurance.
     6.6.10. ARTs will be qualified in their technical AFSC to train personnel as set forth in their job
     description.
     6.6.11. Qualified non-ART reservists may be used as instructors during UTA/AT.
     6.6.12. Host wing functional managers may direct active duty or civilian personnel to conduct train-
     ing for Reserve associate personnel when required. This training may be required in functional areas
     where Reserve associate personnel capabilities do not exist. Prior coordination is required to schedule
     military/civilian instructors if a workweek change is required.
     6.6.13. ART personnel must have sufficient time to prepare for Reserve associate training. However,
     the preparation time for training by ARTs should be arranged to minimize interference with mainte-
     nance tasks. Maintaining a required productivity factor by ARTs assigned to Labor Code 100 is
     important for the Reserve associate unit to support its mission. Preparation of training material,
     Reserves associate organizational duties, and other Reserve associate-related work will be deducted
     from the assigned man-hours, as required. ART personnel assigned to Labor Code 300 will perform
     these duties on an "as needed" basis and as part of their assigned duties.
     6.6.14. The host wing functional managers perform advisory support for the Reserve associate main-
     tenance program IAW AFI 10-301 and AMCR 36-2604.
     6.6.15. Reserve associate maintenance personnel will be given required proficiency training. ART
     personnel will be trained during their civilian workweek and will be enrolled in classes with host per-
     sonnel.
     6.6.16. Support agreements will reflect joint active duty/Reserve associate training concepts and rela-
     tionships.
     6.6.17. Reserve associate personnel will be merged with AMC functional elements for training. The
     success of the Reserve associate program depends on acknowledgment by all concerned that opera-
     tionally, all logistic support personnel are trained for the same goal, i.e., increasing wartime flying
     hour capability. In the functional training function, these other factors will be considered:
        6.6.17.1. The host wing will determine its ability to accomplish any training workload generated
        by absorbing responsibilities prescribed in AMCR 36-2604.
        6.6.17.2. The Reserve Associate Maintenance Group Commander/Senior ART is responsible for
        the conduct of Reserve Associate training during UTA, AT, and individual training periods.

                             MANPOWER AND ORGANIZATION (A51)

7.1. Purpose. This chapter provides guidance for actions affecting the manpower and organizational sta-
tus of Associate units.

7.3. General:
     7.3.1. HQ AMC/A51 is responsible for development of the wartime manpower requirements for
     Reserve associate units. These requirements are expressed in the gaining command's unit authoriza-
     tion file (UAF) and are based upon USAF and AMC manpower standards and wartime man-hour
     availability factors.
     7.3.2. HQ AFRC/XPM is responsible for developing and justifying Reserve associate manpower
     requirements needed to support the peacetime management of Reserve associate units. These Reserve
     associate authorizations will appear in both AFRC and AMC UAFs with a wartime available code
     appearing in the MNT column in accordance with AFM 26-749, chapter 17, table 17-2. If HQ AMC/
     A51 determines that peacetime Reserve associate requirements can be used to satisfy wartime require-
     ments, HQ AMC/A51 will adjust the unit's UAF to reflect the wartime commitment by changing the
     MNT code of the affected positions. HQ AFRC/XPM is responsible for the designation of ART posi-
     tions.
     7.3.3. Procedures for processing manpower authorization change requests originating at base level
     are:
        7.3.3.1. Requested changes to Reserve associate authorizations or organizational design which
        affect wartime manpower requirements. Manpower change requests (MCR) approved by the
        Reserve associate unit commander, with an annotated copy of the UMD containing the affected
        position, will be sent to the servicing AMC Wing/MO through the active duty wing commander.
NOTE: The commander of the Reserve Associate unit is responsible for the basic evaluation, justifica-
tion, and submission of any unit-proposed changes in manpower or organization of the Reserve associate
AMCI36-2602 7 FEBRUARY 2005                                                                           35


units. The commander of the active wing and servicing AMC Wing/MO are responsible for evaluating
the impact upon wartime manpower requirements. Since these units are designed under the provisions of
AFI 38-101, consideration of the effect of the proposed action on like Reserve associate units must be
included in the servicing AMC Wing/MO evaluation. AMC Wing/MO will evaluate the requested change
and forward it with appropriate comments to HQ AFRC/XPM, through the appropriate AFRC NAF with
an information copy to HQ AMC/A51. HQ AFRC/XPM will evaluate each change and forward it to
HQ AMC/A51 for final determination of wartime requirements. If approved, HQ AMC/A51 will notify
HQ AFRC/XPM that changes are being made to appropriate UMDs. Headquarters AFRC will allocate
authorizations if presently included within the budget or as soon as required increases have been pro-
grammed and included in the budget.
       7.3.3.2. Requested changes in ART authorizations in integrated AMC/AFRC work centers, as
       described in 7.3.2. above. MCRs approved by the Reserve associate unit commander will be sent
       to AMC Wing/MO through the Active Duty Host Commander. The servicing AMC Wing/MO
       will evaluate the requested change and forward it, with recommendations, to HQ AFRC/XPM
       through the appropriate AFRC NAF with an information copy to HQ AMC/A51. HQ AFRC/
       XPM will evaluate each change and forward it to HQ AMC/A51 for final determination when
       wartime requirements are affected. If approved, HQ AMC/A51 will notify HQ AFRC/XPMR that
       changes are being made to appropriate UMDs.
       7.3.3.3. Requested changes to manpower authorizations that support peacetime management of
       Reserve associate units. Requests will be submitted by the Reserve associate unit commander to
       HQ AFRC/XPM through the appropriate AFRC NAF. HQ AFRC/XPM will input approved
       changes into the AFRC UAF as peacetime management requirements. HQ AMC/A51 will peri-
       odically review these peacetime requirements to identify those which are capable of satisfying a
       wartime requirement. When such tasking is possible, HQ AMC/A51 will insert the appropriate
       wartime MNT codes into their UAF.
   7.3.4. Direct communication between the servicing AMC Wing/MO and the appropriate AFRC NAF
   is authorized.

7.4. Manpower Requirements Development, Documentation, and Reporting. AFRC manpower is
authorized on the basis of the gaining command's wartime requirements for the given unit. The Total
Force Policy is employed in computing active and Reserve associate requirements for the wartime mis-
sion of the unit. The active force component is manned to support the pre-mobilization emergency
requirement. The Reserve associate component manpower is based upon the additional requirement to
surge from the pre-mobilization emergency situation to the full wartime airlift mission.

7.5. Organization and Mission. The mission of Associate units is prescribed in AMC/AFRC mission
directives. Requests for changes in organizational configuration of Associate units approved by the Asso-
ciate unit commander will be forwarded to the servicing AMC Wing/MO for evaluation through the
active duty wing commander. The AMC Wing/MO will forward requests, with recommendations, to HQ
AMC/A51 with an information copy to HQ AFRC/XPM through the appropriate AFRC NAF. Requests
for changes to the organizational configuration of the peacetime ART and TITLE V civilian UAF Part A
will be sent by the senior Reserve associate commander through the appropriate AFRC NAF to
HQ AFRC/XPM.

7.6. Mobilization. Detailed mobilization procedures are contained in AFI 10-402; AMCI 36-2603,
Administrative Procedures for Mobilization of the Air Reserve Forces (forthcoming), and AFM 26-211.
     7.6.1. Upon mobilization, AMC Wing/MOs will provide an integrated UMD to units serviced. Until
     proposed data system changes will permit an integrated UMD to be published prior to mobilization,
     an interim product available from the servicing AMC Wing/MO should be used for planning. (For
     Host CM: Request the servicing AMC Wing/MOs, in conjunction with the host base personnel sys-
     tems manager (PM), run the Direct English Statement Information Retrieval System (DESIRE) pro-
     gram titled "Unit Manpower Document, Civilian, Active, Reserve Authorizations" and provide the
     output to the appropriate active and Associate wing planners).
     7.6.2. AFRC will retain operational and administrative control of reserve coded manpower authoriza-
     tions established in MAJCOM gained units for reserve support. Reserve coded assets are usually
     mobilized in-place to aid the mobilization/deployment process of the Reserve associate Wing/Group.
     In the event that AFRC no longer requires these assets, they will be released upon AFRC approval for
     utilization by other MAJCOMs.
     7.6.3. Operational and administrative control of wartime manpower authorizations in non-associate
     reserve units within a Reserve Associate Wing/Group will be gained by the applicable MAJCOM.
     These assets are usually mobilized to fill a wartime commitment/mobility tasking.

8.2. General. The commander of the Reserve associate unit is responsible for peacetime management
and control of assigned reservists, as well as for selecting, assigning, promoting, and reassigning all
reservists. All personnel administration will be done by the Reserve Military Personnel Flight (MPF)
assigned to the Reserve associate unit. The host base MPF has no direct responsibility in the peacetime
management of reservists nor operation of the Reserve MPF assigned to the Reserve associate unit. How-
ever, proper working relationships will be established whereby mutual assistance may be exchanged
between functional areas of both MPFs. This should be established by the unit support agreement.

8.3. Non prior Service (NPS) Program. HQ AFRC/RS is responsible for enlisting NPS airmen under
the provisions of AFRCR 33-1, Recruiting and Enlistment Procedures for the United States Air Force
Reserve (PA), for the Reserve associate units. Applicants will not be enlisted in the 2E, 2P, 42, or 43
career fields unless a technical school training quota is available. NPS quotas will not be given for OJT
unless a request is made in writing to HQ AFRC/RS/A4/DP requesting permission to place an individual

Section 8B—Civilian Personnel

8.10. General. In integrated functions in Associate units, overall personnel management over ARTs is
retained by the unit Commander/Senior ART or designee. Because of the dual status of the ART, the
AFRC unit commander/senior ART or designee may inform, as he/she determines appropriate, the host
commander/designee of significant actions affecting senior level ART employees or positions. Certain
key supervisory ART positions must be designated in writing by the unit commander/senior ART to act as
the commander's designee.

8.11. Position Classification Involving ART Positions in Integrated Functions. Integrated functions
are those functions in the aircraft maintenance activity and, in some units, in the aerial port squadron
where the ART works side-by-side with civilian/military employees.
NOTE: HQ AMC/A13 and HQ AFRC/DPC have agreed that HQ AFRC/DPCC will classify all ART
officer positions covered by the ART officer Career Program, and all ART enlisted positions regardless of
where they are located in the AFRC Associate unit. The classification of ART positions located in inte-
grated functions is determined through application of current OPM, DOD, and Air Force criteria in con-
junction with AFRC developed supplemental guidance. The guidance contained in this subsection
relative to the classification of ART positions pertains to both ART officer and ART enlisted positions.

            tify the positions as ART, include the requirement for training of reservists, flying in military
            aircraft for TDY purposes and identify the Reserve associate unit to which assigned. The
            incumbent’s regular duties are primarily ART duties; however, the incumbent may be assigned
            some non-ART duties.
            8.11.1.1.3. Assign ART 7-digit position number,
        8.11.1.2. The servicing Civilian Personnel Flight (CPF) will:
            8.11.1.2.1. Obtain the signature of the immediate supervisor (ART) on the position descrip-
            tion/core document, with the concurrence of the ART commander or designee.
        8.11.1.3. Classification appeals of ART positions located in integrated work activities are the
        responsibility of HQ AFRC/DPCC and will be processed IAW DOD and OPM guidance. The
        CPF will assist the employee in completing his/her appeal package. The CPF will forward the
        employee’s appeal package to HQ AFRC/DPCC for further processing, and advise the employee
        of such.
    8.11.2. Program Maintenance:
        8.11.2.1. Program maintenance for AMC integrated and non-integrated positions will be moni-
        tored by HQ AMC/A13.

   8.24.1. The ART supervisor of each maintenance functional area will have control of time and atten-
   dance reporting of ARTs and AF or non-ART employees.
   8.24.2. First-level supervisors will approve leave for active duty, ART, and non-ART personnel; how-
   ever, leave for ARTs must be coordinated with the ART unit commander or a designee to avoid con-
   flict with normal duty and training requirements.
   8.24.3. The immediate supervisor will request approval for and assign ART personnel to overtime
   work IAW local AMC procedures. Prior approval for paid overtime will be obtained from the Reserve
   associate Wing commander and prior approval for compensatory time off will be obtained from the
   Group Commander IAW AFRC policy if payment will be from AFRC funds. Refer to Comptroller,
   Chapter 3, this regulation, for guidance regarding overtime.

8.25. Shift Assignment. ART employees will not be assigned to a shift or tour of duty in civilian status
that falls on or interferes with a scheduled UTA.

8.26. Compensation Forms. Immediate supervisors will assure that Office of Workers' Compensation
forms are completed and signed for all employees under their supervision at the time of an accident.

8.27. Utilization. ART employees are in separate competitive levels from non-ART employees IAW Air
Force Personnel Center Procedures Guide.. ARTs will be used, at least 70 percent of their time, in duties
