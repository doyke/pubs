                                            Chapter 1

                                           GENERAL

1.1. Introduction. The Air Force (AF) uses telecommunications systems such as telephones,
cellular phones, radios, facsimile, pagers, computer networks, internet-based capabilities (IbC)
such as blogs, web-sites, social networking sites, etc., and other wired or wireless electronic
devices to conduct day-to-day official business. Adversaries can easily monitor these systems to
gather information regarding military capabilities, limitations, intentions, and activities. The
Telecommunications Monitoring and Assessment Program (TMAP) provides commanders with
an assessment as to the type and amount of information traversing telecommunications systems
at risk to adversary collection and exploitation. TMAP products should be used to evaluate
personnel compliance with Information Protection (IP) practices and coordination of Military
Deception or Signature Management activities. TMAP products are also used to support other
security programs/activities, enhance force protection, and focus training requirements. Note:
For the purposes of this AFI, the terms telecommunications systems, communications systems,
and information systems will be synonymous.              The terms telecommunications and
communications will also be synonymous.
1.2. Purpose. The Air Force conducts communications monitoring, through TMAP, to support
Operations Security (OPSEC) for each of the AF Core Functions: Nuclear Deterrence
Operations, Air Superiority, Space Superiority, Cyberspace Superiority, Global Precision Attack,
Rapid Global Mobility, Special Operations, Global Integrated Intelligence, Surveillance and
Reconnaissance, Command and Control, Personnel Recovery, Building Partnerships and Agile
Combat Support. TMAP involves the collection and analysis of information transmitted via
unsecured telecommunications systems. These systems can include radios and wired or wireless
telephones, facsimiles, or computer networks. The assessment function of this program can help
determine if these systems are transmitting critical, sensitive, or classified information. TMAP
products help evaluate an organization’s IP posture and determine the amount and type of
information available to adversary collection entities. TMAP is only accomplished by
designated units and within certain legal parameters.
     1.2.1. The AF monitors official unsecured and unprotected telecommunications systems to
     determine if they are being used to transmit critical, sensitive or classified information.
     Information collected is analyzed to determine if any sensitive or classified information
     transmitted on unsecured and unprotected systems could adversely affect US (and
     allied/coalition) operations. Information can be provided near real-time as a force protection
     tool or systematically collected, analyzed, data based, and reported to major command
     (MAJCOM), direct reporting units (DRU) and field operating agencies (FOA), as long-term
     information liabilities.
     1.2.2. The AF conducts two types of TMAP assessments no-notice and organization
     requested. A no-notice assessment is conducted at the direction of 24 AF/CC without having
     to receive concurrence or provide prior notification to the organization. Organization
     requested assessments are submitted by the AF, MAJCOM, DRU, or FOA OPSEC Program
     Manager (PM) to the 624th Operating Center (OC). All TMAP assessments are at no cost to
     the assessed organization. Refer to paragraph 3.1 for further details. Monitoring resources
AFI10-712 8 JUNE 2011                                                                           5


   may be adjusted during exercises, crises, contingencies, and conflicts. The monitoring and
   subsequent assessing of data are designed to thoroughly examine communications systems
   procedures associated with a specific weapons system, operation, or activity, and document
   their vulnerability to hostile signal intelligence exploitation. These assessments are also
   conducted to provide information and data into the information operations risk analysis
   process; gauge the overall effectiveness of a program or operation; and to support
   information assurance (IA) objectives.
   1.2.3. TMAP is an integral part of the AF OPSEC and Information Operations (IO) Red
   Teaming, and defense critical infrastructure (DCI) programs. It is a very effective tool to
   identify real world problems that can adversely affect the warfighter’s effectiveness. During
   assessments, items such as stereotyped patterns or administrative and physical security
   procedures routinely surface as possible sources of intelligence losses. The assessment
   provides the consumer with a product that provides known threat information.
   1.2.4. TMAP is not an Intelligence mission and organizations conducting TMAP are not
   required to comply with Intelligence Oversight directives with respect to those activities.
   1.2.5. TMAP mission subsets available to a commander include:
       1.2.5.1. Telephony Communications – assessment of AF unclassified voice networks
       which if exploited by adversaries, can negatively impact AF operations.
       1.2.5.2. Radio Frequency (RF) Communications - assessment of AF communications
       within the VHF, UHF, FM, HF, and SHF frequency bands (mobile phones, LMRs,
       wireless LANs) which if exploited by adversaries, can negatively impact AF operations.
       1.2.5.3. E-mail Communications – assessment of unclassified AF email traffic traversing
       the AFNet which if exploited by adversaries, can negatively impact AF operations.
       1.2.5.4. Internet based Capabilities (IbC) - assessment of information posted to all
       publicly accessible information capabilities and applications available across the internet
       in locations not owned, operated, or controlled by the Department of Defense (DoD) or
       the Federal Government, which originate within the AFNet. NOTE: TMAP units are
       only monitoring the information leaving the AFNet and not the IbC sites themselves.
       IbCs include collaborative tools such as social networking sites (SNS), social media,
       user-generated content, social software, e-mail, instant messaging, and discussion forums
       (e.g., YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Google Apps, etc.)
       1.2.5.5. Web Risk Assessment (WRA) – assessment of information posted on AF
       unclassified owned, leased, or operated public and private web sites in order to minimize
       exploitation of AF information by adversaries that can negatively impact AF operations.
       1.2.5.6. Cyber Operations Risk Assessment (CORA) – an assessment of data
       compromised through intrusions of AF networks with the objective of determining the
       associated impact to operations resulting from that data loss to adversaries.
1.3. Notice and Consent (N&C). All authorized users of telecommunications systems and
devices must receive legally sufficient notice that monitoring is conducted and that use of the
system or device constitutes consent to monitoring. All DoD telecommunications systems and
information systems are subject to monitoring for authorized purposes as prescribed by DoDI
8560.01, Communications Security (COMSEC) Monitoring and Information Assurance (IA)
 6                                                                      AFI10-712 8 JUNE 2011

                                            Chapter 2

                                       TMAP PRODUCTS

2.1. There are two basic types of TMAP products , consisting of reports and transcripts.
Products will not contain PPI, PII, or information that could reasonably identify individuals in
assessed offices, flights, or sections, such as titles, names, ranks, complete phone numbers,
complete e-mail addresses, etc. Office symbols may be released if the release of the office
symbol does not provide sufficient data to identify an individual. A product may contain names,
titles, or ranks when it is an integral part of the possible disclosure, unless it somehow identifies
one of the monitored parties. EXCEPTIONS: As described in paragraph 3.3.1.
2.2. Products. All TMAP products are at a minimum ―FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY‖ until
possible disclosures are thoroughly evaluated and any weaknesses corrected. Classify TMAP
products according to security classification guides, AFI 31-401, Information Security Program
Management, AFI 24-405, Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide, and/or the DoD
4500.54-M, Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Manual, geographic appendices, and/or
classified supplement. Mark products according to current policy and guidance.
2.3. Reports. The four TMAP reports are information protection alerts (IPA), immediate
reports, summary reports, and final reports. The customer determines the distribution,
frequency, and delivery times of these reports. Reports may include short quotes or extracts of a
communication when needed to clarify information presented, but not entire reproductions of
communications. Summary and final reports will also include applicable threat information.
Samples of IPA, immediate, and summary reports are available in Attachment 2. TMAP reports
provide operational commanders and planners with near real-time reports of classified or
sensitive information disclosures that may adversely affect US (and allied/coalition) operations.
Operational commanders and planners should use these reports for evaluating the effectiveness
of OPSEC measures, and developing measures to diminish the value of disclosed information.
They may also use these reports to identify and focus training requirements and to justify
developing and funding corrective actions.
   2.3.1. An IPA is a shortened reporting format used to notify the customer of possible
   disclosures upon discovery during the assessment. These reports may contain compromises
   of classified information, information of value to hostile intelligence services, critical
   information or information pertaining to the movement of high-level distinguished visitors
   (DV).
   2.3.2. An immediate report contains similar information as an IPA, but provides time-
   sensitive information, force protection information, and mission critical information during
   exercise and real world operations.
   2.3.3. A summary report is a summary of problem areas or possible disclosures noted during
   the assessment. This report is issued at varying intervals during the assessment, such as
   monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually. The customer can waive the requirement for this report
   entirely.
   2.3.4. A final report is similar to a summary report, but contains an executive summary (if
   applicable); recommendations; and all the identified disclosures from the assessment listed in
   chronological order. This report is typically issued within 30 calendar days after the
 16                                                                 AFI10-712 8 JUNE 2011


   completion of the assessment. The customer can grant extensions or waive the requirement
   for this report entirely.
2.4. Transcripts. A transcript can be part or all of a verbatim reproduction of an assessed
communication and may include certain identifying information. It may also contain
transcriber’s comments or remarks to clarify or enhance understanding of the information
presented. There are two types of transcripts -- sanitized and unsanitized.
   2.4.1. Sanitized transcripts are furnished upon request to expand on or enhance
   understanding of information presented in a report. A sanitized transcript is a true
   representation of a communication, but will not contain personal privacy information (PPI),
   personally identifiable information (PII), or information that could reasonably identify
   assessed offices, flights, or sections. They are resource intensive to prepare and should be
   requested sparingly. Transcripts are typically requested when a report reveals critical
   information disclosures that may affect operations or possible security violations. Release
   procedures are specified in paragraph 3.3.
   2.4.2. Unsanitized transcripts are true and complete representation of a communication. An
   unsanitized transcript includes both the sending and receiving communicator’s information
   (if available.)
2.5. Combining Products. Based on evolving information technologies TMAP products may
be combined with other products or used within the restrictions of paragraph 3.2.
AFI10-712 8 JUNE 2011                                                                            17

   4.5.1. Install the notice and consent log-on banner, Attachment 3, on all computers. The
   banner is automatically displayed upon boot-up and/or initial log-on for the computer system
   regardless of the access methodology (physical, network, remote access, dial-in, etc.). Place
   the banner on the computers in such a way that the user must press a key to get beyond it,
   thereby demonstrating acceptance of its provisions.
   4.5.2. For information systems where it is not technically feasible (due to character
   limitations, etc.) to install the complete notice and consent log-on banner cited in Attachment
   3, as determined by the MAJCOM or DRU/A6, perform the following requirements:
       4.5.2.1. Install the abbreviated log-on banner cited below on the information system:
                     “I’ve read & consent to terms in IS user agreem't.”

     4.10.3.2. Summary letters covering more than one physical installation (example: remote
     Air Base as a GSU) must clearly identify each installation. FOAs DRUs and tenants will
     be addressed per the following:


         4.10.3.2.1. FOA and DRU located on a host base will report their Notice and Consent
         compliance through the host Wing IA office.
         4.10.3.2.2. FOA and DRU not located on a host base will report their Notice and
         Consent compliance as a Wing IA office.
         4.10.3.2.3. All other tenant wings or organizations report their Notice and Consent
         compliance through the host installation Wing IA office.
  4.10.4. Following host base wing or communications commander signature, installation SJA
  endorsement and MAJCOM or DRU /SJA endorsement, the Wing IAO sends the installation
  summary package, with supporting documentation for review no later than 15 May. Wing
  IAOs also send an informational copy of only the summary letter to the MAJCOM and
  DRU/A6.
  4.10.5. The Installation Staff Judge Advocates (SJA) reviews the summary and attached
  documentation and provides written review (see Attachment 5 for SJA 1st endorsement
  format). This SJA review should ensure the actions taken are sufficient to establish
28                                                                   AFI10-712 8 JUNE 2011


  compliance with the requirements of this Instruction. The summary and its attachments
  should clearly demonstrate users of DoD telecommunications or information systems know
  such use constitutes consent to monitoring. If the SJA determines the documentation is
  deficient in any of the requirements, the package shall be returned for corrective action. If
  the package is determined to be legally sufficient, the Wing IA office includes the SJA’s
  written determination as part of the certification package. Upon endorsement, the installation
  SJA shall forward the summary back to the Wing IA Office for their tracking and submission
  to the MAJCOM or DRU SJA for endorsement. Final submissions to MAJCOM and DRU
  SJA must occur NLT 1 May.
  4.10.6. MAJCOM /A6 , in coordination with AFSPC/A6, ensures subordinate bases and
  installations adhere to established procedures and timelines within this guidance as well as
  respond to all summary report requests for correction or clarification within 14 duty days.
  4.10.7. MAJCOM SJA reviews the summary, attached documentation for legal compliance,
  and provides written review (see Attachment 5 for MAJCOM SJA 2nd endorsement format).
  If the MAJCOM SJA determines the documentation is deficient in any of the requirements,
  the package shall be returned for corrective action. If the package is determined to be legally
  sufficient, the MAJCOM SJA’s written determination becomes part of the certification
  package. The MAJCOM SJA returns the package to the Wing IA.
  4.10.8. AFSPC/JA approves all summary packages before submission to SAF/GC.
  4.10.9. Any deficiencies noted by AFSPC/JA are submitted to the Wing IAO. When
  necessary for compliance, coordination through the MAJCOM is required to ensure
  installations understand and accomplish necessary corrective actions. Once deficiencies are
  sufficiently addressed, corrected packages are reviewed by AFSPC/JA.
  4.10.10. AFSPC/A6 ensures all Air Force facilities submit inputs in order to receive biennial
  certification according to Table 4.1, Notice and Consent Certification Schedule. Sends the
  AFSPC/JA approved package with AFSPC/JA endorsement to SAF/GC, 1740 Air Force
  Pentagon, Suite 4C756, Washington, DC 20330-1740, by 15 July. If AFSPC/JA or SAF/GC
  determines a summary contains insufficient evidence of Notice and Consent actions as
  required by this Instruction, the Wing IA and Wing/JA will be notified to provide follow-on
  corrective action, with MAJCOM/A6 and MAJCOM/JA included as information addressees
  on the notification. AFSPC/A6 will collect process metrics where possible, monitor, and
  report processing times to AF/A3/A5, SAF/CIO A6, SAF/GC, and MAJCOM.
  4.10.11. SAF/GC certifies that there has been sufficient notice that the use of DoD
  telecommunications and information systems constitutes consent to monitoring. If SAF/GC
  determines the summary package contains insufficient evidence to establish full compliance
  with notice of monitoring requirements, the summary is returned for further corrective action
  prior to certification. Once all base summary reports contain legally sufficient actions for
  notice and consent, SAF/GC returns a certification listing to AFSPC/A6 by 1 September of
  each even-numbered fiscal year listing all installations approved for authorized monitoring
  activities. Upon receipt of the certification listing, AFSPC/A6 will forward copies to an
  authorized monitoring agency as prescribed by DoDI 8560.01. AFSPC/A6 will forward
  copies of the certification listing to 624 OC on or before 25 September of each even number
  fiscal year. Any updates to the certification listing will be forwarded to 624 OC immediately

A3.1. [Use this banner for desktops, laptops, and other devices accommodating banners of
1300 characters. The banner shall be implemented as a click-through banner at logon (to the
extent permitted by the operating system), meaning it prevents further activity on the information
system unless and until the user executes a positive action to manifest agreement by clicking on a
box indicating "OK."]
A3.2. You are accessing a U. S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is
provided for USG-authorized use only.

   authorized purpose.
   A3.3.4. This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to
   protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.
   A3.3.5. Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or
   CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or

         MANDATORY NOTICE AND CONSENT PROVISION FOR ALL DOD
               INFORMATION SYSTEM USER AGREEMENTS

A4.1. By signing this document you acknowledge and consent that when you access
Department of Defense (DoD) information systems:
A4.2. You are accessing a U. S. Government (USG) information system (IS) (which
includes any device attached to this information system) that is provided for U.S. Government
authorized use only.
A4.3. You consent to the following conditions:
A4.4. The U. S. Government routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this
information system for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing,
communications security (COMSEC) monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel
misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.
A4.5. At any time, the U. S. Government may inspect and seize data stored on this
information system. Communications using, or data stored on, this information system are not
private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used
for any U.S. Government-authorized purpose.
A4.6. This information system includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access
controls) to protect U.S. Government interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.
A4.7. Notwithstanding the above, using an information system does not constitute consent to
personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigative searching or
monitoring of the content of privileged communications or data (including work product) that are
related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their
assistants. Under these circumstances, such communications and work product are private and
confidential, as further explained below:
A4.8. Nothing in this User Agreement shall be interpreted to limit the user's consent to, or in
any other way restrict or affect, any U.S. Government actions for purposes of network
administration, operation, protection, or defense, or for communications security. This includes
all communications.
A4.9. The user consents to interception/capture and seizure of ALL communications and
data for any authorized purpose (including personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or
counterintelligence investigation). However, consent to interception/capture or seizure of
communications and data is not consent to the use of privileged communications or data for
personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence investigation against any party
and does not negate any applicable privilege or confidentiality that otherwise applies.
A4.10. Whether any particular communication or data qualifies for the protection of a
privilege, or is covered by a duty of confidentiality, is determined in accordance with established
legal standards and DoD direction. Users are strongly encouraged to seek personal legal counsel
on such matters prior to using an information system if the user intends to rely on the protections
of a privilege or confidentiality.
AFI10-712 8 JUNE 2011                                                                            39


A4.11. Users should take reasonable steps to identify such communications or data that the
user asserts are protected by any such privilege or confidentiality. However, the user's
identification or assertion of a privilege or confidentiality is not sufficient to create such
protection where none exists under established legal standards and DoD policy direction.
A4.12. A user's failure to take reasonable steps to identify such communications or data as
privileged or confidential does not waive the privilege or confidentiality if such protections
otherwise exist under established legal standards and DoD direction. However, in such cases,
the U.S. Government is authorized to take reasonable actions to identify such communication or
data as being subject to a privilege or confidentiality, and such actions do not negate any
applicable privilege or confidentiality.
A4.13. These conditions preserve the confidentiality of the communication or data, and the
legal protections regarding the use and disclosure of privileged information, and thus such
communications and data are private and confidential. Further, the U.S. Government shall take
all reasonable measures to protect the content of captured/seized privileged communications and
data to ensure they are appropriately protected.
A4.14. In cases when the user has consented to content searching or monitoring of
communications or data for personnel misconduct, law enforcement, or counterintelligence
investigative searching, (i.e., for all communications and data other than privileged
communications or data that are related to personal representation or services by attorneys,
psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants), the U.S. Government may, solely at its
discretion and in accordance with DoD direction, elect to apply a privilege or other restriction on
the U.S. Government's otherwise-authorized use or disclosure of such information.
A4.15. All of the above conditions apply regardless of whether the access or use of an
Information system includes the display of a Notice and Consent Banner ("banner"). When a
banner is used, the banner functions to remind the user of the conditions that are set forth in this
user agreement, regardless of whether the banner describes these conditions in full detail or
provides a summary of such conditions, and regardless of whether the banner expressly
references this user agreement.
