SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Minor grammatical corrections and style updates to align with other Fighter Wing Instructions.
Added Natural Disaster Immediate Responder (NDIR) recall procedures. Added NDIR
identification into pyramid diagrams (Attachment 7).
1. General
   1.1. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS. The primary method of recalling personnel is the Pyramid
   Recall System (PRS). It is the responsibility of each unit and staff agency assigned to the 35th
   Fighter Wing to develop and keep a current Pyramid Recall Roster (PRR) to facilitate
   immediate recall of personnel.
       1.1.1. Tenant units will be recalled at the discretion of the Installation Commander.
       Method of recall is at the tenant unit’s discretion.
       1.1.2. Each unit’s PRR will be updated by the last day of the month or earlier if necessary.
       All units assigned to Misawa AB will send electronic copies to their respective group
       commander’s office and the 35 FW Command Post (CP) within 5 duty days of the update.
       1.1.3. Each person residing off the installation will provide their PRR POC/ Unit Control
       Center (UCC) and supervisor with detailed directions and/or map to their residence, using
       well known landmarks as a guide. The directions and/or map will include the members
       Rank/Name, House Number, and Telephone Number (if applicable). Directions and/or
       maps will include instructions, with initial starting point at the Misawa Friendship Gate
       (Main) or Falcon Gate (POL) to the individual’s quarters.
       1.1.4. Crisis Action Team (CAT) members are responsible for keeping the CP informed of
       their location and preferred method of contact (ie. Office, Home Phone, Cell Phone, LMR).
       In the event they will not be available, they will immediately notify the CP of their
       alternate’s name and location. Members of the CAT are responsible for briefing their
       replacements on duties performed.
   1.2. RECALL/COMM-OUT ROSTER CONTENTS: To facilitate an orderly telephone recall,
   rosters should be organized in a logical sequence with key personnel, including UCC
   personnel who collect and report recall status, notified first. Whenever possible, consolidate
   individual small offices into a single roster to increase the speed of notifications.
       1.2.1. At a minimum, recall rosters must contain: Name, Grade, Residence Address,
       Residence Telephone Number, Pager/Cell Phone Number (if applicable), identified
       Natural Disaster Immediate Responders (if applicable), and common numbers (CP, 35
       SFS, Urgent Care Clinic, Emergency Operations Center (EOC), and UCC). Additionally,
       the name of the Primary/Alternate POCs and ‘Current as of’ dates will be included on the
       front page. Reference Attachments 7 and 8 for examples.
       1.2.2. The reverse of both the recall and the Comm-out roster shall contain a scripted
       narrative for members to use during recalls. Spaces will be provided in the narrative to
       relate/pass-on information including at a minimum recall type, FPCON, reporting location,
       required gear, and MOPP level (Attachment 7).
       1.2.3. Units may combine the Recall and Comm-out rosters. Reference Attachment 8 for an
       example.

   2.6.3. Carry a current copy of your unit recall roster at all times.
   2.6.4. Destroy old copies of recall rosters by any method that prevents compromise.
   Acceptable methods of destruction include burning or shredding, so long as personal data
   is not recognizable and information is destroyed beyond reconstruction.
   2.6.5. Once you have been notified that a recall has been initiated:
       2.6.5.1. Contact personnel beneath you on the roster. If there is no answer, move to the
       next person on the list to keep the integrity of the recall system. Once the next person is
       notified, try to contact the previous individual again. If the individual has still not been
       contacted, contact their respective work center/UCC. The work center/UCC will
       arrange for a runner to be sent to their residence. NOTE: If the work center/UCC
       cannot be contacted report the incident when you report in.
       2.6.5.2. Pass on the information that was given to you and verify the individual you

       according to the method of recall specified in the recall message, (do not shave,
       shower, or eat) wearing the required duty uniform and with the specified gear. NOTE:
          Individuals who are EOC Representatives will notify their unit work center/UCC upon
          reporting for duty at the EOC.
   2.7. Unit Control Centers Will:
      2.7.1. Upon activation identify personnel who are assigned/attached and personnel on
      TDY/leave.
      2.7.2. Prepare and consolidate strength accounting report IAW Pre-CIDs and your UCC
      Recall Checklist.
      2.7.3. The consolidated UCC initial strength or “available numbers” should not change in
      subsequent reports. Report only TOTALS in each category.
      2.7.4. Ensure those members required to report for duty sign in on an accountability roster
      with time notified and time arrived (Attachment 6). This procedure is used to maintain unit
      strength and to check recall response time.
      2.7.5. Contact their EOC representatives immediately when experiencing connectivity
      issues with TBMCS-UL.
      2.7.6. Send a runner out to individuals who have not been contacted (ensure individuals are
      not on leave outside the local area/TDY). This task may be delegated to a work center level
      in-order to streamline the recall process.
          2.7.6.1. Once units have exhausted all means for trying to locate missing personnel,
          UCCs will contact Security Forces regardless of real world or exercise and request a
          “Be On the Look Out” (BOLO) for missing individuals. During exercises, Security
          Forces will then contact 35 FW/IGI to confirm if the BOLO personnel are part of the
          exercise. Once contacted by Security Forces, 35 FW/IGI will release personnel back to
          their duty sections. If BOLO personnel are not part of the exercise Security Forces will
          implement their standard procedures.
   2.8. Emergency Operation Center (EOC) Representatives Will:
      2.8.1. Upon activation, contact UCCs with recall start time.
      2.8.2. If UCCs are unable to update TBMCS-UL due to connectivity problems, they will
      contact their EOC reps immediately. EOC reps will then update TBMCS-UL no later than
      reference start time (RST) +60, +120, and +180 minute cutoffs or until 100%
      accountability is reached.
3. Recall Methods
   3.1. OVERT RECALL PROCEDURES:
      3.1.1. Use all means available to recall base personnel. Consider the use of sirens, giant
      voice, Facebook, CAC, telephones, radios, public television, speaker equipped vehicles,
      Telephone Alerting System, (TAS) etc.
      3.1.2. Overt recalls include Alpha and Charlie recalls IAW Attachment 7.
   3.2. COVERT RECALL PROCEDURES:
      3.2.1. Use only telephone or personal contact to recall base personnel. Do not use sirens,
      giant voice, CAC, radios, public television, etc. Units should consider staggered arrival
      times for personnel to reduce the perception of mass recall operations. When directed by
      wing leadership, members should use discretion when carrying personal, chemical and
      individual protective equipment (IPE) bags to duty sections (e.g. stowing bags in vehicles).
      Comm-out procedures may be used to reduce telephonic surveillance.
      3.2.2. Covert recalls include Bravo and Delta recalls IAW Attachment 7.
   3.3. COMM-OUT RECALL PROCEDURES: Recall personnel when all communications
   systems are inoperative or cannot be used.
      3.3.1. Utilize directions and/or maps to notify individuals by personal contact only.
      3.3.2. Comm-out Rosters will be arranged according to housing area. See Attachment 8 for
      an example of a Comm-out Recall Roster and Map.
      3.3.3. Members will maintain directions and/or maps for all personnel in their
      column/section of the Comm-out roster.
   3.4. SIERRA OPTION PROCEDURES: Recall all personnel EXCEPT those on established
   shift schedules or crew rest. For those individuals, ensure 100% accountability via established
   unit procedures.
4. Types Of Recall
   4.1. GENERAL RECALL (ALPHA/BRAVO): A recall of all personnel to their duty stations.
   In a real world general recall situation, associate and attached units at Misawa may also be
   recalled at the 35 FW/CC’s discretion. Recall for these units will be initiated by the “Parent”
   agencies as depicted in Attachment 4.
      4.1.1. Unless directed otherwise, assigned military personnel will report to their duty
      section immediately after notification of a general recall IAW section 2.6. For example, if
      you receive the following message, “This is Lt Smalls. The 35 FW/CC has directed an
      Alpha Recall. Recall time is 1400L. Item numbers 1, 4, 10, and 14 apply. Complete your
      recall notifications and report to your appropriate place of duty.” Then you will report to
      your primary duty station regardless if you are a member of the CAT, EOC, or UCC.
      4.1.3. Upon hearing the base siren/giant voice recall notification, Senior Wing Leadership
      will notify the CP if they have not been notified of the recall prior to the giant voice
      announcement. Do not delay reporting for duty in favor of making this advisory call.
   4.2. RECALL FROM BASE FACILITIES: When directed 35 Force Support Squadron (FSS)
   will contact facilities equipped with public address systems (e.g. Exchange, Commissary,
   Theater, Child Centers, etc.) who will then notify military personnel of a recall during
   operating hours.
   4.3. SYSTEM TEST: Recall of specific units without a general recall of all personnel.
      4.3.1. When directed, the CP will notify the affected unit to initiate their pyramid recall.
      4.3.2. If recall is a telephonic test of the pyramid notification system, then the last
      individual to be notified will call the initiating person of the recall roster with the time they
      were notified.
      4.3.3. The results of the test will be passed to the agency that originated the recall.
      4.3.4. Can be Sq/CC initiated.
4.4. SELECTIVE RECALL (CHARLIE/DELTA): Recall of specific elements of the ICC,
EOC, and/or UCC without implementing a general recall. 35 FW/CC will select the most
appropriate tier recall for the situation and direct CP to initiate.
   4.4.1. For a C-1/D-1 recall the members of the CAT will report to the primary or alternate
   ICC. The CAT is comprised of the 35 FW/CC, 35 FW/CV, 35 OG/CC, 35 MXG/CC, 35
   MSG/CC, 35 MDG/CC, and 35 FW/XP. See Attachment 3.
   4.4.2. For a C-2/D-2 recall members of the CAT and CAT administration will report to the
   primary or alternate ICC. The CAT administration includes the CAT Coordinator and
   TBMCS IME.
   4.4.3. For a C-3/D-3 recall members of the CAT and CAT administration plus selected unit
   representatives will report to the primary or alternate ICC. The 35 FW/CC will contact the
   unit commander for an ICC representative as required.
   4.4.4. For a C-4/D-4 recall the all members of the CAT, CAT administration, and EOC will
   report to the primary or alternate ICC. Additionally, all members of the UCCs will report
   to their respective UCC area. The intent is to stand-up a fully functional ICC, not to recall
   all wing personnel to their primary duty stations.
       4.4.4.1 For C-4 Natural Disasters, all ICC (CAT/EOC/UCC) and individuals identified
       by their units as Natural Disaster Immediate Responders will attend to the immediate
       security and safety of their families and then automatically report for duty. All other
       individuals will determine if communications are available. If so, they will contact
       their UCC for accountability/guidance. If no communications are available,
       individuals will see to the immediate safety of their families and then report to their
       UCC/ duty location.
   4.4.5. If the 35 FW/CC needs to stand-up the ICC and recall all base personnel to their
   primary duty stations, the recall message will include Alpha/Bravo in addition to C-X,
   D-X. For example, if you receive the following message, “This is Lt Smalls. The 35
   FW/CC has directed a Charlie-Four Recall. Recall time is 1400L. Item numbers 1, 4, 10,
   and 14 apply. Complete your recall notifications and report to your appropriate place of
   duty.” Then as a member of the CAT, CAT administration, or EOC you will report to the
   ICC; UCC members will report to their respective UCC areas.
       4.4.5.1. On the other hand, if you receive the following message, “This is Lt Smalls.
       The 35 FW/CC has directed an Alpha, Charlie-Four Recall. Recall time is 1400L.
       Item numbers 1, 4, 10, and 14 apply. Complete your recall notifications and report to
       your appropriate place of duty.” Then as a member of the CAT, CAT administration,
       or EOC you will report to the ICC; UCC members will report to their respective UCC
       areas; all other members of the 35 FW will report to their primary duty locations.
4.5. EOC RECALL: The Installation Commander or Incident Commander may direct the
activation of the EOC in the event of a natural disaster (e.g. typhoon, earthquake) or major
incident (e.g. aircraft accident, chemical spill). See Attachment 2.
4.6. TENANT UNIT RECALLS: Tenant units are encouraged to conduct quarterly recall
exercises with a comm-out recall conducted at least once annually.
   4.7. TELEPHONE NOTIFICATION/100% ACCOUNTABILITY RECALL: Recall will be
   accomplished in the same fashion as a general recall using the PRS. The individual at the
   bottom of the recall chain will contact the individual at the top of their chain to report the
   number of personnel contacted.
      4.7.1. Units will establish internal methods of reporting to UCC. UCCs will report these
      numbers IAW Chapter 6.
5. Audible Signals
   5.1. AUTHORITY: All audible signals will be used at the discretion of the 35 FW/CC or
   designated alternate.
   5.2. BASE SIREN/GIANT VOICE: All personnel will contact the personnel in their recall
   chain immediately (before reporting to their duty stations). In between siren signals, the giant
   voice system will be activated and recall instructions announced. The siren will be sounded a
   minimum of two times.
   5.3. CAC: The CP will seize control of the CAC and make announcements at the instruction of
   35 FW/CC or designated representative.
   5.4. RADIO/TELEVISION BROADCAST: Armed Forces Network (AFN) is the sole
   authority to direct radio and television broadcasts in the event of a Japan-wide contingency.
   Public Affairs (PA) will coordinate with AFN, at the direction of the Wing Commander, to use
   AFN resources for recall/information distribution purposes.
6. Personnel Strength Reporting
   6.1. PERSONNEL: Personnel strength reporting is implemented in conjunction with the
   Reference Start Time (RST).
      6.1.1. Units must coordinate with their respective EOC representative to obtain the RST.
      6.1.2. UCCs are required to report personnel strength data at RST plus 60, 120, and 180
      minutes or until 100% accountability is reached (units should strive for 100%
      accountability NLT RST + 120).
      6.1.3. Accordingly, this data must be updated in TBMCS-UL prior to the prescribed cutoff
      times.
      6.1.4. During Covert Recalls, units will primarily use TBMCS to relay strength data to the
      EOC. Only secure calls on a STE or VOSIP will be used to talk between the UCC and
      EOC. As a last resort units will hand-carry the strength data and mission capability status
      to the unit EOC representative.
      6.1.5. EOC representatives will ensure UCCs update TBMCS-UL NLT the required cutoff
      time. EOC representatives will update accountability numbers if the UCC encounters
      connectivity problems. NOTE: The FW/CC, depending on the given situation, will
      determine whether individuals TDY or on leave must be individually contacted. By
      default, those members will not be contacted. Members on local area leave will be counted
      as available for exercise purposes. Members who would normally be able to arrive back in
      time to meet their Designated Operational Capability (DOC) tasking will be considered
      available.
6.2. TENANT UNITS: Tenant units will provide the 35 FW/CP with a monthly recall/standby
roster or a 24-hour phone contact in case of emergencies or disaster notification.
