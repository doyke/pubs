SUMMARY OF CHANGES
The document incorporates the ideas, principles, and concepts of risk management into several areas of
the instruction. Chapter 1 discusses using risk management during the Hazard Abatement Action. It also
adds risk management to all levels of Air Force personnel’s responsibility. This chapter also specifically
outlines responsibility for Installation Civil Engineer offices. Chapter 2 clarifies the need for adequate
and experienced safety manning in all disciplines. The chapter also adds Space Safety Officers, Manag-
ers, and Engineers as well as allowing FSNCOs to be maintenance, aircrew or career safety personnel.
This chapter also expands the information on the Table of Allowances for computer support and adds a
paragraph outlining the Major Range and Test Facility Base safety programs. Chapter 3 clarifies the role
of the safety office in program evaluations of contractor facilities and actions. Spot Inspections and High
Interest Area definitions and actions were also added. Chapter 5 changed the periodic summaries and the
issuance times to allow for better coverage of the topics. Added a significant paragraph on Mishap Anal-
ysis programs and methods as well as provides guidance on how to use the data. It chapter also discusses
the use and creation of metrics. Chapter 6 updated all class numbers and rearranged the paragraphs to
provide a clearer understanding of the course and their uses. An annual training requirements report is
now required to be submitted by the MAJCOMs. Chapter 7 expands the Aircraft Maintenance, Aero
Club Operations, and Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard areas. Chapter 8 requires ground safety personnel
to attend the Facility Utilization Board and clarified other areas of the chapter. Chapter 9 outlines the
new requirements of the program executive officer, program and system safety manager in all aspects of
system safety. Risk assessment was added to ensure its incorporation into all aspects of system safety.
Chapter 10 was modified by the addition of weapons safety personnel management requirements as well
as additions in the responsibilities of the weapons safety personnel. AFSC/SEW also added a paragraph
discussing weapons safety training. Chapter 11 expanded the roles, responsibility, and training require-
ments for space safety officers. It outlines the different types of space safety, both launch and orbital
safety. It also specifically discusses the training necessary for both types of safety training. Attachment
5 was added outlining the responsibilities of weapons safety manning. The bar (|) preceding a paragraph
indicates a major revision from the previous edition.

                                                Chapter 1

                                       PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1.1. The Mishap Prevention Process. Air Force host and tenant safety offices are responsible for imple-
menting the Air Force Safety Program. Any interorganization and interservice agreements will be
addressed in the Host/Tenant Support Agreement. The host safety office implements mishap prevention
programs and processes for all Air Force units and programs on base unless otherwise outlined in a Host/
Tenant Support Agreement. Safety staffs at all levels assist with implementation and integration of oper-
ational risk management into all Air Force operations and missions.

1.2. Determining Standards. Commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals, with the
host safety office’s help, identify rules, criteria, procedures, Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
tion (OSHA), Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH),
explosive safety, or other safety standards that could help eliminate unsafe acts or conditions that cause
mishaps.

1.3. Applying Standards. Applying sound standards is basic to preventing mishaps. All Air Force units
must apply standards by observing these fundamental principles:
   1.3.1. Commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals must all contribute to the mis-
   hap prevention program. An effective program depends on individuals integrating mishap prevention
   at every functional level and being responsible for complying with applicable safety standards.
   1.3.2. Units must establish specific procedures (for example, inspections) to ensure that all personnel
   and activities comply with the program standards.
   1.3.3. Every level of command is responsible for compliance with applicable safety standards.

1.4. Hazard Controls:
   1.4.1. Identifying Hazards. The primary responsibility for identifying workplace hazards, to include
   equipment and environmental situations that place workers, equipment, or facilities at risk, rests with
   the individual. Commanders, functional managers, supervisors, and individuals identify hazards by
   evaluating the work environment and job tasks. Safety, environmental, and medical staffs and
   fire-protection personnel provide technical assistance.
   1.4.2. Determining Hazard Abatement Action. The proper way to eliminate a particular hazard is
   often difficult to determine, and alternatives are limited by time and cost. After considering all fac-
   tors, choose the alternative that contributes the most to overall mission accomplishment. Consider
   these three categories of corrective actions:
       1.4.2.1. Planning and Engineering. Use risk management processes during the planning, design,
       and execution phases to eliminate hazards as early as possible when they will have the least cost
       and operational impact on the program. Continually review plans, specifications, and drawings to
       identify and eliminate hazards until the equipment or facility is operating. Eliminate hazards iden-
       tified after an item is deployed by modifying the item or installing protective devices or guards.
       The supervisor, with safety staff help, completes a job safety analysis (JSA) and operational haz-
       ard analysis (OHA) to ensure worker, equipment, and work environment compatibility. Proce-
8                                                           AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


       dures for JSA and OHA are contained in the Supervisors Safety Training (SST) handbooks,
       AFOSH Standard 91-31, Personal Protective Equipment, and AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupa-
       tional and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health (AFOSH).
       1.4.2.2. Procedural Actions. Develop procedures or restrictions to minimize risk if planning or
       engineering actions cannot be used to eliminate hazards. If necessary, impose restrictions such as
       operational limits, frequent inspections, protective equipment, or stopping the operation until cor-
       rective action is taken.
       1.4.2.3. Personnel Actions. People work more safely and effectively when properly trained and
       motivated. Supervisors must keep their people involved in risk management. AFI 91-213, Oper-
       ational Risk Management, outlines the basic tenets and processes of risk management. Opera-
       tional risk management is a systematic process of detecting, assessing and controlling measures to
       enhance total organizational performance.
    1.4.3. Taking Action. Commanders protect national resources, both human and material, and have
    the authority to take action in implementing safety measures.
       1.4.3.1. Functional managers correct hazards in their areas of responsibility.
       1.4.3.2. The safety office helps functional managers and commanders determine needed correc-
       tive actions and provide the commander with follow-up support until the hazard is eliminated or
       changes are in place.

1.5. Notifying Other Affected Units and Agencies. Relay hazard and mishap information to other units
and agencies with similar missions or equipment according to AFI 91-204, Investigating and Reporting
US Air Force Mishaps. AFI 91-204 and Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of this instruction explain what infor-
mation to relay and what communication systems to use. Mishap prevention data is worthless unless peo-
ple who need the information get it. No one cannot afford to have mishaps caused by problems already
known and solved by other units.

1.6. Program Responsibilities:
    1.6.1. The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) makes policy and gives guidance to
    ensure that technical and engineering criteria for developing and acquiring Air Force systems, facili-

                                  THE SAFETY ORGANIZATION

2.1. Safety Staff. One staff element should manage each organization's safety program. The safety staff
will perform and/or assists risk assessment of wing mission, contingency exercises, and operations. In
addition, the staff will review and help develop emergency plans and procedures to include, but not lim-
ited to, SAFE HAVEN, SAFE CONVOY, HAZMAT and disaster response required by AFI 32-4001 or
AFI 32-4002, and when required by law (Clean Air Act), or accidental release risk management programs
for explosives. The chief of safety must answer directly to the commander. Full-time safety personnel
must be qualified, trained to manage safety programs, and able to function at the staff level. Use the Air
Force Manpower Standard (AFMS) 106A to determine the required size of the safety staff. In units with-
out an authorized safety position, the commander must appoint a collateral duty safety individual to per-
form the safety functions. All requests for manpower changes to safety office personnel will be
coordinated with the applicable MAJCOM/SE office before submission to the local management engi-
neering team. Do not assign full-time safety personnel additional duties that are not directly associated
with the job duties described in the 91-series directives and their supplements.
   2.1.1. Chief of Safety. Supervises the mishap prevention program for the commander. The chief of
   safety must be qualified in the primary mission of the unit. Assigned individuals must complete the
   Chief of Safety Course (WCIP05B). For example, in units with an operational primary flying mis-
   sion, the chief of safety must be a rated officer, qualified and current in a unit mission aircraft. In a
   space satellite control unit the chief of safety must have experience in the satellite operations.
   2.1.2. Flight Safety Officer (FSO). Full-time FSOs are assigned to authorized unit positions by the
   AFMS. FSOs at squadron and wing level must be current in a unit mission aircraft. FSOs in higher
   headquarters positions should be rated officers with experience in headquarters-managed mission air-
   craft. Full-time FSOs must complete the Flight Safety Officer Course (WCIP05A) and should fill the
   position for a minimum of 2 to 3 years.. Commanders of flying units without an authorized flight
   safety officer (FSO) will appoint a collateral duty FSO.
   2.1.3. Ground Safety Managers (GSM). Full-time GSMs are assigned to positions authorized by
   the AFMS. Assigned individuals must complete the Ground Safety Management Course (WCIP05D)
   and the Advanced Occupational Safety Course at the earliest opportunity after being assigned as a
   GSM.
   2.1.4. Weapons Safety Managers (WSM). The AFMS authorizes full-time Weapons Safety posi-
   tions in units. WSMs must be qualified in their Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) or civil service
   equivalent in the maintenance or operation of nuclear weapons, missiles, or non-nuclear munitions.
   Full-time WSMs must complete the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) Weapons Safety
   Course. Persons selected as WSMs should be at least a 7-level in their specialty code.
   2.1.5. System Safety Officers, Managers, and Engineers. Some commands and staff agencies are
   authorized system safety positions. Individuals in these positions must complete the System Safety
   Management Course or the System Safety Analysis Course according to their particular job require-
   ments.

     2.1.6. Space Safety Personnel. Units performing orbital or launch missions are authorized space
     safety positions. These positions at squadron and wing level must be experienced in the unit’s mission
     and be trained as outlined in Chapter 11.
     2.1.7. Flight Safety NCO (FSNCO). The FSNCO is an integral part of the flight safety program and
     reports directly to the chief of safety or FSO. The FSNCO must have maintenance or aircrew experi-
     ence with the unit-assigned aircraft type or be a career safety person. Once appointed, individuals
     should complete the Flight Safety NCO and Jet Engine Mishap Investigation Courses.
     2.1.8. Career Safety Personnel. The Air Force has an enlisted career field (AFSC 1S0X1) and a
     civilian career field (GM/GS-018, Occupational Safety and Health Manager or Specialist, and GM/
     GS-803, Safety Engineer). These career safety personnel are assigned to positions authorized by the
     UMD. The enlisted safety career program is described in AFMAN 36-2108, Airman Classification.
     The civilian safety career program is described in AFI 36-601, Civilian Career Program Manage-
     ment. See Attachment 2 for the enlisted career program.

2.2. Organizing the Program. The same prevention techniques apply to all disciplines. In organizing
the safety staff:
     2.2.1. Ensure that safety staffs manage the mishap prevention program and report directly to the
     MAJCOM, DRU, FOA, or installation commander.
     2.2.2. Consolidate all safety disciplines under a single manager.

2.3. Managing the Program. Commanders must establish a management strategy that:
     2.3.1. Ensures that functional managers and supervisors (rather than the safety staff) take corrective
     action for deficiencies.
     2.3.2. Minimizes administrative tasks, details, and augmentation duties not directly associated with
     safety.
     2.3.3. Involves the safety staff in appropriate meetings, conferences, and councils.
     2.3.4. Integrates safety into all operations and missions of the wing’s organizations.
     2.3.5. Emphasizes risk management.
     2.3.6. Emphasizes accountability.

2.4. Safety Office Equipment. When setting up equipment requirements consider these elements:
     2.4.1. Vehicles and Communication. The safety staff must be mobile to do its job. In flying units,
     missile units, and units operating a test range, the staff must have the use of a two-way radio-equipped
     vehicle. Any radio net, appropriate to the mission, that allows the vehicle to move freely around the
     airfield or missile complex is acceptable.
     2.4.2. Tables of Allowance (TA). These TAs list items that safety offices use:
        2.4.2.1. TA 006, Organizational and Administrative Equipment.
        2.4.2.2. TA 009, Small Computer Systems. As a minimum, each full-time safety staff office
        should have: a 486 computer (or faster), with CD-ROM read capability and a laptop with portable
        CD-ROM suitable for reading Air Force publications for use by mishap investigation boards and
AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                         15


       using software compatible with Microsoft products (the Air Force standard). As part of the safety
       office’s computer support, to include the assigned laptop, it is highly recommend to have direct

       ments.
   2.4.3. Mishap Investigation Kits. Each MAJCOM determines the need for and the contents of
   investigation kits. A recommended list of contents is in AFP 127-1, US Air Force Guide to Mishap
   Investigations, Chapter 2. Safety staffs with host base responsibilities will maintain a mishap
   response and investigation kit sufficient to meet initial response and interim safety investigation board
   requirements.

2.5. Office Administration:
   2.5.1. ALSAFECOM Messages. Handle and distribute these messages as described in Chapter 5.
   2.5.2. Mishap, Safety Inspection, and Hazard Reports. Maintain and dispose of all reports created
   or received according to AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, AFI 37-138, Records Disposition
   - Responsibilities and Procedures, and AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule.

2.6. Publications Library. Air Force safety offices normally establish a publications library. When a
master publication library and technical order library are readily available, the safety office needs to main-
tain only those publications that specifically apply to the safety program.
   2.6.1. Documents may be hard copy or in electronic format. The library should include:
       2.6.1.1. DoD standards and handbooks.
       2.6.1.2. Air Force policy directives, instructions, pamphlets, and TOs.
       2.6.1.3. AFOSH standards.
       2.6.1.4. Copies of AFSP 91-1, Flying Safety, AFSP 91-2, Road & Rec, and AFSP 91-3, Nuclear
       Surety and Weapons Safety Journal.
       2.6.1.5. Pertinent National Fire Protection Association and American National Standard Institute
       standards.
       2.6.1.6. Federal and military specifications and standards, OSHA, National Institute of Occupa-
       tional Safety and Health, National Safety Council, and commercial publications.
   2.6.2. The DoD Index of Specifications and Standards (DoDISS) lists Federal and military specifica-
   tions and standards. Acquire publications that you cannot obtain through the supporting Publications
   Distribution Office (PDO) or Technical Order Distribution Office through the supporting library.

     2.6.3. The safety office advises the unit commander on how many magazines their units will need and
     ensures that they receive adequate distribution through the PDO or customer account representatives.
     AFI 37-160, Vol 7, Air Force Publications and Forms Management Programs--Publications Librar-
     ies and Sets, outlines responsibilities for keeping this type of library.

2.7. Air Force Councils and Committees. Safety councils and committees provide forums for discuss-
ing safety problems and keeping commanders, functional managers, and supervisors informed on the sta-
tus of the mishap prevention program. This allows for more proactive involvement at all functional levels
in mishap prevention and hazard identification.
     2.7.1. The wing or unit commander determines the need, frequency, agenda, and participants for all
     safety councils and committees except those required by public law. Commanders can form safety
     councils and committees at any level to focus group attention on safety or health problems. Any
     council or committee must satisfy a specific need and may not duplicate an existing management
     function.
     2.7.2. The occupational safety and health council is required by law and is convened according to
     AFI 91-301, Air Force Occupational and Environmental Safety, Fire Protection, and Health Pro-
     gram.

2.8. Non-US Air Force Councils and Committees. The Air Force supports federal, state, and local
safety councils and committees and encourages safety staffs to take part in them.

2.9. Major Range and Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Safety Programs. The Air Force operates several
ranges established under DoDD 3200.11, Major Range and Test Facility Base. Operation of these
MRTFB ranges carries with it specific responsibilities for public safety. The overall goal of the range
safety program is to ensure safety consistent with operational requirements, which includes the prevention
of test objects, space launch vehicles, or their hazardous effects from violating established limits. MAJ-
COMs will establish safety policy for MRTFB activities. The wing commander of the unit operating the
MRTFB is considered the activity commander. Under the direction of the MAJCOM concerned, the
activity commander will:
     2.9.1. Ensure safety is consistent with operational requirements. Risk should be quantified and
     acceptable limits established. Additional risk should be accepted at an appropriate level.
     2.9.2. Establish safety requirements and ensure all range users are in compliance.
     2.9.3. Establish allowable ground and flight safety conditions and take appropriate action to ensure
     that test articles do not violate the conditions. Where the reliability of the test object is not estab-
     lished, appropriate measures should be taken to ensure it will not endanger the public or their property.

                                                Chapter 3

      SAFETY INSPECTION, EVALUATION, ASSESSMENT, STAFF ASSISTANCE, AND
                               MONITORING

3.1. Safety Inspection. Safety inspections help identify hazards and measure compliance with safety
program requirements outlined in this instruction and AFI 91-301. Through inspections, the safety staff
helps the commander determine the condition of work areas, the safety of work practices, the degree of
compliance with safety and health standards, and the degree of compliance with safety program require-
ments. For GSUs, if the host base safety office conducts the facilities inspection annually, the GSU will
forward a copy of the report to the MAJCOM parent wing. The safety staff and functional managers will
ensure qualified inspectors inspect:
   All Air Force facilities and work areas once within a year, except as otherwise directed.
   High interest areas will be designated in writing and “spot” inspected monthly.
   At least 20 percent of unmanned missile launch facilities once a year. Select these launch facilities to
ensure that a representative segment of the unit's assets is inspected annually.
   3.1.1. Administrative areas. Collateral duty, task-qualified safety personnel may conduct these
   inspections when the safety staff determines the mishap potential is minimal. The base safety staff
   develops specific provisions for meeting inspection requirements and conducts over-the-shoulder
   assessments of the collateral-duty personnel to ensure that their safety inspections are sound.
   3.1.2. Non-Administrative areas. Functional managers, and supervisors inspect all work areas peri-
   odically, through spot inspections. The Chief of Safety will determine the frequency of spot inspec-
   tions and ensure activities that operate around-the-clock are adequately surveyed at times other than
   normal duty hours.
   3.1.3. Safety Inspection Responsibilities. The host safety staff inspects units that do not have an
   authorized, full-time safety position in a particular discipline. The host performs the required annual
   inspection for those safety areas:
       3.1.3.1. Unless a host-tenant agreement requires otherwise, the parent or gaining unit or com-
       mand inspects units not supported by an Air Force base.
       3.1.3.2. If their mishap potential is low, remotely located units of approximately 25 people or less
       may not need an annual inspection by a safety staff. In these cases, the MAJCOM determines
       other provisions for meeting annual inspection requirements.
   3.1.4. Safety Inspection Procedures:
       3.1.4.1. Scheduling Inspections. Safety staffs may designate inspections as "prior-notice" or
       "no-notice." Annual flight, ground, and weapons inspections should be conducted jointly when
       possible. Also, when possible, combine safety inspections with other inspections to reduce the
       number of inspections a unit receives.
       3.1.4.2. Personal Consultations. Inspectors must consult with workplace personnel and their
       union representatives on matters affecting their safety and health and give them the opportunity to
       identify unsafe and unhealthy working conditions, equipment, and practices. Conduct such con-
18                                                            AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


        sultations privately and do not identify employees who want to remain anonymous. Be careful not
        to offer anyone a formal grant of confidentiality.
        3.1.4.3. Inspection Checklists. Use inspection checklists, especially for items common to several
        units or facilities. Make checklists available to the supervisors of the activities slated for inspec-
        tion.
        3.1.4.4. Safety Inspection Reports. Report annual inspections in writing. Send formal reports to
        the unit commander, the supervisor, and functional manager. In tenant units, send a copy of the
        report to the parent safety office. These reports must contain:
            3.1.4.4.1. The unit, activity, or work area inspected.
            3.1.4.4.2. The date of the inspection.
            3.1.4.4.3. A description of any hazards or unsafe work practices, noted with reference.
            3.1.4.4.4. Causes of deficiencies and hazards noted.
            3.1.4.4.5. Recommendations for corrective action.
            3.1.4.4.6. Risk assessment codes (RAC) for identified hazards, where applicable.
            3.1.4.4.7. Management and supervisory support compliance.
        3.1.4.5. Follow-up actions. Use spot inspections and follow-up reporting to ensure corrective
        action is taken and the hazards are mitigated.

3.2. Safety Program Evaluation. At least once every three years, qualified safety personnel must eval-
uate the safety program management of each organization at wing or installation level and higher.
     3.2.1. Command Units--Wing Level and Above. The higher headquarters evaluates the safety pro-
     gram management of organizations at or above the wing level as required by OSHA. Conduct evalu-
     ations with prior notice.
     3.2.2. Evaluation Scope. Safety program management evaluations address the areas of command
     and functional manager support, compliance with program directives, and the effectiveness of mishap
     prevention programs.
     3.2.3. Evaluation Reports . Prepare a written report for each evaluation. Send a copy of the report
     to the commander and safety staff of the organization evaluated.

3.3. Assessments. Qualified safety personnel periodically assess the safety program management of each
organization below wing level as required by DoD and this instruction.. These assessments should cover
all safety disciplines. You may conduct assessments in conjunction with the annual safety inspection.
Conduct assessments with prior notice.
     3.3.1. Wings and groups with GSUs, Detachments, or Operating Locations (OL) will perform a safety
     program assessment of each activity at intervals not to exceed 3 years. Include a safety inspection as
     part of the safety program assessment of the activity.
     3.3.2. Wing and groups will conduct unit safety program assessments of all GSUs at intervals not to
     exceed 36 months. If requested by the GSU commander and if manpower and funds are available to
     support the GSUs request the assessment may be conducted more frequently.
AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                           19


   3.3.3. Assessment Scope. Safety program management assessments address command and func-
   tional manager support, compliance with program directives, and the effectiveness of mishap preven-
   tion programs, including an analysis of unit mishap reports and other management indicators.
   3.3.4. Assessment Reports. Prepare a written report for each assessment. You may include assess-
   ment reports with inspection reports, but you must prepare them as separate sections. Send a copy of
   the assessment report to the commander of the organization assessed.

3.4. Staff Assistance. Safety staffs at all command levels visit subordinate units when problems, defi-
ciencies, or special subjects require on-scene assistance. Visits may also be necessary when units imple-
ment new missions, equipment, or programs that impact mishap prevention programs. The objective is to
help develop solutions, not to inspect or evaluate. Give a report to the visited unit's commander, if
requested. Do not require replies unless the action started during the visit needs monitoring by the higher
headquarters safety staff or requires further staff action above the level of the visited unit. The staff assis-
tance visit program is designed to provide a high degree of flexibility in determining which units to visit
and the functional safety areas involved. The purpose of staff assistance program is to provide assistance
to unit safety personnel by reviewing their management and administrative procedures for effectiveness
and providing recommendations for improvement.

3.5. Contract Monitoring. If safety personnel are required to conduct a safety quality assurance evalua-
tions (QAE) function, QAE training is required locally through Base Contracting. NOTE: AF Safety
personnel must not put anything in a contract that establishes a requirement for the Air Force to protect
contractor employees or their equipment. Likewise, do not include anything in inspection or surveillance
programs to give the perception that the Air Force is supervising or observing contractor personnel to pro-
vide for their personal safety or to ensure the safety of their equipment. Requirements for protection of
the general public may be included, (for example, barriers around trenches). Air Force safety personnel
must avoid taking actions that put them in direct control of a work site or contractor employees. If an Air
Force inspector notices a potential OSHA violation, he/she should report the hazard to the contracting
officer, who can remind the contractor of the obligation under the contract to comply with all pertinent
regulations. Unless there is imminent danger, Air Force personnel (other than a contracting officer)
should avoid reporting safety violations directly to the contractor. Similarly, Air Force personnel should
not perform safety inspections of worksites and contract Statements of work (SOW) should not require
Air Force inspections.

3.6. High Interest Areas. These areas have the greatest risk to life or property damage, have experi-
enced repeated mishaps, or in the judgment of the appropriate (ground, flight, weapons, or space) safety
discipline requires added monitoring. These inspections may be no-notice or scheduled and the MAJ-
COM, Numbered AF, and/or host installation safety office establishes the documentation requirements.

3.7. Monitoring. Monitoring is a continuous, informal surveillance of operations to ensure adequate
control of hazards and compliance with safety program objectives. Spot inspections and surveillance are
ways to fulfill this requirement.
   3.7.1. Spot Inspections. Spot inspections are no-notice to check the day-to-day safety and health of
   an organization, workcenter, facility, etc. The MAJCOM, Numbered AF, and/or host installation
   safety office establishes documentation requirements for spot inspections. Minimum documentation
   will include date, inspector’s name, organization or activity inspected, unit point of contact, and a
20                                                           AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


     brief description of what was observed, if there was/was not a discrepancy and of the status (open/
     closed).
     3.7.2. Surveillance. Surveillance is a monitoring tool that can also assist in checking the day-to-day
     activities of an organization. No documentation is necessary for surveillance unless unsafe conditions
     or practices are noted and corrective action cannot be made without written notification. The follow-
     ing is a partial list of operations and areas that should be routinely checked.
        3.7.2.1. Aircraft ground handling and parking.
        3.7.2.2. Fuel servicing; hot refueling, integrated combat turnarounds, and concurrent servicing.
        3.7.2.3. Aircraft maintenance procedures and facilities (on all workshifts).
        3.7.2.4. Hazardous compressed gases and chemical storage, handling and use.
        3.7.2.5. Air freight cargo compatibility, handling, loading, and unloading.
        3.7.2.6. Work performed at elevated heights.
        3.7.2.7. Activities requiring use of personal protective equipment and clothing.

                                 HAZARD REPORTING PROGRAM

4.1. What Hazards To Report. Mishap prevention depends on personnel identifying, reporting, and
correcting hazards promptly and efficiently. Any person assigned, attached, or under contract to the Air
Force may report a hazard. Submit a hazard report on any event or condition that affects flight, ground,
weapons, or space safety. Reportable hazards include unsafe procedures, practices, or conditions. The
reporting requirement in this paragraph is exempt from licensing in accordance with AFI 37-123, para-
graph 2.11.6, The Information Collection and Reports Management Program: Controlling Internal, Pub-
lic, and Interagency Air Force Information Collection.

4.2. Reporting Criteria. Submit hazard reports unless personnel can take corrective action under this
AFI or any of these Air Force publications:
   4.2.1. AFI 11-215, Flight Manuals Program.
   4.2.2. AFI 91-204, Investigating and Reporting US Air Force Mishaps.
   4.2.3. TO 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System.
   4.2.4. TO 00-35D-54, USAF Materiel Deficiency Reporting System.
   4.2.5. AFI 51-1101, Air Force Procurement Fraud Remedies Program

4.3. Reporting Procedures:
   4.3.1. Report hazards to the responsible supervisor or local agency. If the hazard is eliminated on the
   spot, no further action is required unless it applies to other similar operations or to other units or agen-
   cies.
   4.3.2. If the hazard presents imminent danger, the supervisor or individual responsible for that area
   must take immediate action to correct the situation or apply interim control measures.
   4.3.3. Report hazards that cannot be eliminated immediately to the safety office by AF Form 457,
   USAF Hazard Report (HR), by telephone or in person. Reports can be submitted anonymously.
   4.3.4. The safety staff investigates the HR. The investigator discusses the HR with the member who
   submitted the report (if known), the responsible supervisor or manager, and other parties involved to
   validate the hazard and determine the best interim control and corrective action.
   4.3.5. If the hazard is validated:
       4.3.5.1. The investigator assigns a RAC, a HR control number, and monitors corrective action
       until complete.
       4.3.5.2. The investigator completes the HR's Part II, "Summary of Investigation," and sends it
       promptly to the individual responsible for making sure corrective action is completed and the haz-
       ard eliminated or controlled.
       4.3.5.3. The responsible individual completes Part II, "Action Taken," within 10 working days
       and returns the HR to the safety office for monitoring.
22                                                            AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


        4.3.5.4. The investigator tells the originator (if known) about the corrective action and conducts
        follow-up reviews until the action is completed. The investigator informs the originator (if
        known), about the completed action within 10 workdays after the report is closed.
     4.3.6. If the HR response is not satisfactory to the reporting member, the member may submit a
     reevaluation request according to AFI 91-301.
     4.3.7. HRs that generate an AF Form 3, Hazard Abatement Plan, may be closed and corrective action
     monitored through the hazard abatement process. See AFI 91-301 for further action required for AF
     Form 3 processing.

4.4. Additional Reporting Procedures:
     4.4.1. Transient personnel unable to report a hazard at a base where it is found, submits the HR to the
     next Air Force base they visit, or to the safety office at their home base. That safety office sends the
     report to the responsible base safety offices.
     4.4.2. The safety office sends reports on hazards that cannot be corrected at the local level to the
     agencies that can take appropriate action.
     4.4.3. Tenant personnel send hazard reports involving activities for which the host is responsible to
     the host base safety office for processing.
     4.4.4. Send hazard reports by message if they require urgent action. Send messages to the safety
     office at the headquarters where action can be taken. List units with similar equipment as information
     addressees.
     4.4.5. Persons identifying hazards involving weather forecasting must submit hazard reports as soon
     as possible to ensure that records are not destroyed. Promptly after landing, aircraft commanders
     advise the appropriate facility providing air weather services of their intention to submit a hazard
     report. If necessary, notify these facilities by message.
     4.4.6. Base safety offices send hazard reports that involve other military services, foreign nations, or
     agencies outside the Air Force to HQ USAF/SE, 9700 G Ave SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5670 and
     to the affected Air Force units and their chain of command as information addressees. AF Form 130
     should be submitted to HQ AFCIC/ITIA, 1250 AF Pentagon, Washington DC 20330 for a Report
     Control Symbol control number assignment.

4.5. Promoting the Program. The unit’s commander ensures the AF Form 457 is available to all unit
personnel. The base safety office will maintain a small quantity of the forms to help ensure availability by
base personnel. The safety office must respond promptly (within 10 working days) to the reporting mem-
ber on their findings, status of the AF Form 457, and any recommendations.

               MISHAP PREVENTION INFORMATION AND DATA ANALYSIS

5.1. Information Protection. Analyzing and distributing mishap prevention information are key ele-
ments in mishap prevention. All safety mishap reports, except Class A and B “8-hour” messages, are "For
Official Use Only" (FOUO). For FOUO handling procedures, see AFI 37-131, Air Force Freedom of
Information Act Program. Some safety mishap reports require additional handling restrictions as privi-
leged reports. See AFI 91-204 for further information and handling restrictions.
   5.1.1. Privileged and FOUO controls protect the parts of the report that personnel provided in confi-
   dence or conclusions investigators derived from those parts. Use mishap reports only for mishap pre-
   vention and limit access to these reports. The safety staff must brief everyone with access to
   privileged safety or privacy act information on the proper handling procedures annually. See AFI
   91-204 for more information.
   5.1.2. To provide wider dissemination, sanitize mishap information by removing the parts that make
   it privileged. AFI 91-204 describes the method for sanitizing privileged reports.

5.2. Action Information:
   5.2.1. Mishap Reports. Send reports of Air Force mishaps as directed by AFI 91-204. Many of
   these reports have recommendations needing urgent action by some addressees. Consider mishap
   reports to be action documents.
   5.2.2. ALSAFECOM Messages. The Air Force Chief of Safety (HQ USAF/SE) uses the ALSAFE-
   COM message to rapidly distribute critical safety information. HQ USAF/SE sends these messages to
   each MAJCOM commander and director (or chief) of safety. The messages convey mishap preven-
   tion data and often require action to eliminate hazards.
   5.2.3. After receiving an ALSAFECOM message, each director or chief of safety:
       5.2.3.1. Reviews the message and sends it to the agencies and units that need to take action.
       5.2.3.2. Keeps a file of ALSAFECOM messages that are applicable to the unit.
       5.2.3.3. Annotates the message to show its distribution and the actions the unit takes in response
       to the reported hazard or mishap.

5.3. Advisory Information:
   5.3.1. Recurring Publications. The AFSC, Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Air Force Reserve, and
   Air National Guard may produce recurring publications providing education and training in mishap
   prevention.
       5.3.1.1. Purpose and Scope. The goal of these documents is to prevent mishaps in operating and
       maintaining aircraft and associated equipment and facilities, storing and handling explosives, con-
       ducting industrial operations, operating government and privately owned vehicles, and participat-
       ing in off-duty sports and recreation. The publications also provide educational information on
       implementing OSHA standards and in establishing and maintaining nuclear surety and environ-
       mental safety programs.
24                                                            AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


        5.3.1.2. Air Force military members and civilian employees, including Air Force Reserve and Air
        National Guard units and members, are the primary audience of special publications. The second-
        ary audience is other DoD and non-DoD personnel supporting Air Force missions. A one-for-one
        safety publication exchange is authorized with foreign militaries where such action clearly sup-
        ports mishap prevention purposes and is in the US Government’s best interest. This exchange of
        information provides an open forum for mishap prevention ideas and programs.
        5.3.1.3. The Commander, AFSC, will issue recurring publications pertaining to the entire Air
        Force mishap prevention program. MAJCOMs, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard may
        issue recurring publications pertaining to mishap prevention in their unique missions.
        5.3.1.4. Operating Policies. The office of primary responsibility (OPR) for each document will
        determine the number of pages and frequency of publication.
            5.3.1.4.1. Each OPR will act as its own reviewing authority for document contents.
            5.3.1.4.2. Each OPR will establish a distribution ratio to control distribution of recurring pub-
            lications. Publication Distribution Offices (PDOs) will distribute the publications to organiza-
            tions at Air Force installations. The OPR will make distribution to units without a PDO by the
            most economical means.
     5.3.2. Periodic Summaries. HQ AFSC sends periodic mishap summaries to the MAJCOM safety
     staffs. These summaries include recent mishap experience, mishap statistics, analyses of current
     problem areas, and proposed changes in safety policy. Regular summaries include:
        5.3.2.1. Blue Four News. HQ AFSC/SEF sends monthly Blue Four News messages to safety
        offices throughout the Air Force, summarizing the previous month's Class A flight mishaps and
        commenting on the trends that the mishaps indicate. This summary is to be controlled as a “priv-
        ileged” report since dates, times, and mishap specifics.
        5.3.2.2. How Goes It in Ground Safety. HQ AFSC/SEG sends this message on an as needed basis
        but not less than semi-annually to all Air Force safety offices and the Army and Naval Safety Cen-
        ters to provide updates on ground safety issues and activities.
        5.3.2.3. Hurtline and OUCH. These HQ AFSC/SEG quarterly messages provide a summary and
        analysis of Air Force Class A, B, and C mishaps for all Air Force Safety offices.
        5.3.2.4. Ground Safety Spotlight. This HQ AFSC/SEG sends this message on an as needed basis
        but not less than quarterly to all Air Force offices to provide safety interest items from recent mis-
        haps, injuries, compensation cost data, or resource protection needs.
        5.3.2.5. OSHA Chronicles. HQ AFSC/SEG sends this message on an as needed basis but not less
        than semi-annually to all Air Force safety offices to provide information on OSHA visits to Air
        Force installations giving a synopsis of findings and citations to prevent reoccurrence.
        5.3.2.6. AFSP 91-1, Flying Safety. Focuses on all aspects of flying safety to include mishap
        investigations, the wildlife hazard reduction (BASH) program, as well as command-generated
        articles and mishap prevention concerns.
        5.3.2.7. AFSP 91-3, Nuclear Surety and Weapons Safety Journal. HQ AFSC/SEW writes articles
        focusing on all aspects of weapons and space safety as well as nuclear surety. In every issue of
        this journal, HQ AFSC/SEW discusses conventional and nuclear weapon mishap trends and
        potential methods of prevention.
AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                         25


       5.3.2.8. AFSP 91-2, Road & Rec. Focuses on all aspects of ground safety to include mishap
       investigations as well as command-generated articles and mishap prevention concerns.
   5.3.3. MAJCOM Publications. MAJCOMs should publish either a safety magazine, newsletter, or
   safety kit to aid in the dissemination of command-specific safety information.

5.4. Methods of Distribution. Select an appropriate distribution method by considering your content,
time available, and audience. Some suggested methods of distributing advisory information are:
   5.4.1. Periodic safety meetings.
   5.4.2. Supervisor safety briefings.
   5.4.3. Base newspapers and bulletins.
   5.4.4. Safety publications.
   5.4.5. AFSC or MAJCOM publications.
NOTE: The MAJCOM chief of safety decides whether to distribute summaries to subordinate units.

5.5. Mishap Analysis Programs. Full-time safety staffs at all levels should develop locally oriented
mishap analysis programs to evaluate mishap statistics and identify trends. Managers develop local pro-
grams to formulate intervention efforts by determining the root causes for mishaps. When setting up an
analysis program:
   5.5.1. Identify successes or problem areas and trends, measure safety program effectiveness, and
   guide prevention actions.
   5.5.2. Make sure that the program is flexible enough to allow for additional changes.
   5.5.3. Some healthy prevention programs are characterized by large numbers of reports (indicating
   safety awareness on the part of submitters), while others may see few or no reports (including a safe
   operating environment)

5.6. Standard Mishap Rates. Safety staffs at the MAJCOM level and above can compute the standard
rates for their organization. Care must be taken to ensure the statistic validity of the rates. Information on
mishap rates can be obtained by calling AFSC/SEC. The Air Force Safety Center uses standardized rates
for
   5.6.1. Flight mishaps
   5.6.2. Federal Employee’s Compensation Act Lost Time Injury/Illnesses
   5.6.3. On-Duty Ground Mishaps
   5.6.4. Off-duty Ground Mishap
   5.6.5. Combined On- and Off-duty Mishap

5.7. Mishap Prevention Analysis Methods. One way to approach analysis is to divide it into two broad
functions: monitor and study. The monitor function is an ongoing task, while the study function is a spe-
cific effort directed to a particular problem.
26                                                             AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


     5.7.1. Monitor Function. In this method, the safety staff selects categories of raw data and reviews
     them regularly in the form of tabulations or rates. The object is to identify trends and problem areas.
     Selection of the areas to be monitored depends on the available data and the needs of the organization.
     Mishap reports are a good place to start, but other areas should not be overlooked. Some other cate-
     gories that may be appropriate for analysis are:
        5.7.1.1. Hazardous Air Traffic Reports
        5.7.1.2. High Accident Potential (HAP)
        5.7.1.3. Deficiency Reports
        5.7.1.4. Inspection/Assessment Reports
        5.7.1.5. Foreign Object Damage Reports
        5.7.1.6. First-Aid Injury Reports
        5.7.1.7. Maintenance Logs or Reports
     5.7.2. Study Function. This process requires a much more detailed examination of a problem area.
     There are no specific ground rules on how to do it; the nature of the problem and the data available
     tend to dictate the way to go. First, it is best to draft an objective statement that describes the problem
     and limits the study. An example is: “Determine why ‘X’ is increasing.” Next identifying factors and
     data that affect the problem. Then develop a plan on how these factors and data area going to be col-
     lected, tabulated, compared, plotted, and calculated. Finally, collect the data, analyze it, and come up
     with conclusions that answer the objective statement. Without conclusions, the study is of no value.
        5.7.2.1. Limitations:
            5.7.2.1.1. Availability of Data. The type and depth of analysis that can be done at each level
            depends on the amount of data available. As a rule, small amounts of data cause large changes
            in rates and trends which can be misleading. To get large amounts of data, it is often better to
            add the exposure of several small units or to use data for a longer period of time. Another
            method is to add near mishaps to the reportable ones. This not only expands the data base but
            it often gives a better picture of the root causes. For example, when analyzing operational
            injuries, look at all the injuries that occurred on the job, not just the reportable ones.
            5.7.2.1.2. Rates. Mishap rates are often misused because the limitations are not considered.
            Rates do not reflect responsibility for mishaps. By themselves, rates do not measure or reflect
            all the factors that influence exposure. They should not be used as the sole basis for determin-
            ing the success of prevention efforts. Any raw data (aircraft tire failures, for example) can be
            divided by an exposure (number of landings) to give a rate. That, in itself, has no value unless
            it can be compared to other like rates or computed often to set a trend. Rates can also be mis-
            leading if the exposure is small or if the mishaps considered have little in common.
            5.7.2.1.3. Tabulations. Tabulations normally do not reflect trends because exposure is not
            considered. Tabulated data plotted per unit of time, such as number of injuries each month,
            can show a trend graphically. Trends derived in this way must be used with caution because
            the exposure factor may not be accurate. The number of injuries per month, for example,
            might be meaningless if population, mission, emphasis on treatment, or disability compensa-
            tion rules change.
AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                       27


           5.7.2.1.4. Trends. When the data base is small, a few mishaps can cause large changes in rates
           and make it difficult to determine trends. To get large amounts of data, it is often necessary to
           add the data from several units or weapons systems. The resulting trends may be mathemati-
           cally accurate but might not apply to any specific system. To set trends, it is best to use the
           most data available, defined in the narrowest way possible. There are several recognized ways
           of smoothing large clumps in rates to establish a reasonably valid trend. One way is to carry
           rates cumulatively for a period of 12 months rather than by calendar year. Starting rates at zero
           each year works well at the Air Force and MAJCOM level but may not at lower levels.

5.8. Use of Analysis Data. The purpose of analysis is to help prevent mishaps. Present conclusions
drawn in a useful format to the people who can use them directly in their prevention programs. The data
should also be available to other organizations with like equipment or problems. After taking corrective
actions, follow-up analysis may be done to measure the effectiveness of these actions.

5.9. Metrics.
   5.9.1. Mishap metrics (calculated as a number of successful events against some kind of total event
   exposure) are an effective way to compare the actions and accomplishments of your unit. Compari-
   sons between other organizations or MAJCOMs may be misleading based on differences in opera-
   tions, environment, equipment, or other variables. The metrics used by the safety community to this
   point have focused on results - the number of mishaps experienced over time relative to exposure.
   While this “bottom line” information is useful, it is incomplete. A mishap rate alone cannot explain
   the most critical information needed by commanders--feedback proving that a particular effort caused
   the result. In most safety offices today, we are pleased when the mishap rate is down, but we cannot
   satisfactorily explain why. When the mishap rate is up, we tend to choose short-term solutions to this
   long term-problem. The answer to the metrics dilemma is to decide on a set of safety performance
   measurements that precede mishap data and have a reasonable expectation of positively impacting the
   mishap rate.
   5.9.2. Most quality-based assessment programs advise against the use of “negative metrics.” The
   appropriate use of metrics is particularly important within the safety function, since some use of neg-
   ative indicators is unavoidable (see AFPD 91-2). While each mishap represents a “failure to prevent,”
   there is currently no corresponding way of measuring “successful prevention.”
   5.9.3. Hazardous air traffic reports (Chapter 7), hazard reports (Chapter 4), high accident potential,
   inspections and assessments (Chapter 3), and other reports submitted as a part of the Air Force Mis-
   hap Prevention Program under this instruction and AFI 91-204 are integral to the success of our over-
   all safety program. Significant numbers of such reports may indicate a developing adverse trend,
   while even a single Class C mishap report or hazard report could identify the potential for a far more
   serious loss. Accordingly, maximum reporting is an essential element of successful prevention and
   risk assessment and must in no way be discouraged. Therefore, the use of numbers of safety reports
   of any type as a metric is prohibited.
   5.9.4. Safety knowledge is one type of such data. Measuring safety knowledge is a good performance
   measurement that should be tracked with metrics. Poor judgment is a leading cause of Air Force
   reportable mishaps. In order to improve judgment decisions, individuals must have adequate knowl-
   edge and the right attitude (Good judgment = knowledge + attitude). Unit commanders and supervi-
   sors can positively influence their personnel by ensuring everyone maintains a high degree of safety
28                                                           AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


     knowledge. The level of safety knowledge can be measured by using surveys or tests, thus command-
     ers and supervisors reinforce the desired behavior. Individuals should be periodically surveyed for on
     and off-duty knowledge of basic safety principles, or job related safety standards. The safety knowl-
     edge areas that could be surveyed or tested:
        5.9.4.1. Seldom performed tasks such as emergency procedures
        5.9.4.2. Tasks that have a history of high mishap frequency
        5.9.4.3. Critical tasks where failure or mishap could jeopardize the mission
        5.9.4.4. Point-in-time, safety-related job knowledge could be displayed on a bar chart.
        5.9.4.5. Trend data for a particular AFSC could be displayed on a line or a control chart to observe
        the trend data over time.
     5.9.5. Feedback to safety-related behavior is essential. Below are three other potential metrics for
     measuring safety and hazard abatement.
        5.9.5.1. One such feedback mechanism is to link safety performance feedback to leadership
        requirements by identifying safety requirements as a stand-alone scoring item on feedback and
        performance reports. This metric would show leadership support for risk reduction management
        support and will increase the safety knowledge of the leadership and the individuals.
        5.9.5.2. The second possible metric would be to establish a metric that tracks letters of commen-
        dation, letters of admonishment, letters of counseling (positive and negative), letters of reprimand,
        and Article 15 actions for safety-related actions. This metric would show the units culture con-
        cerning safety-related activities.
        5.9.5.3. The last potential metric would be to track the cycle time for abatement actions. This
        would show the commander’s support for reducing the hazards in the unit by showing leaderships
        willingness to apply O&M dollars to abate hazards. Potential measurements can be:
            5.9.5.3.1. The number of days, months, or years that pass between problem recognition and
            problem resolution is clearly measurable. When measured and displayed, the information will
            display to the leadership the numbers of days that pass before significant safety problems are
            resolved.
            5.9.5.3.2. At the end of each reporting period, the major command could request closure time
            of all risk assessment code (RAC) items 1-4 assigned throughout the year. Risk assessment
            data to the RAC 4 level is meaningful since it shows a squadron leaderships resolve to fix the
            problem even the minor problems while RAC 1-3 are usually controlled by resources beyond
            the squadron financial and manpower capabilities.

after appointment. Unit Safety Representatives at GSUs will receive training from the host base safety
staff or by using a training course developed by the parent unit. Qualified safety personnel should con-
duct this training. Weapons Safety USRs could use the HQ AFSC provided Introduction to Weapons
Safety as part of their initial training. This CD-ROM is available through the host safety office.

6.3. Full-Time Safety Personnel. There are several safety courses available for full-time safety person-
nel. MAJCOM safety staffs make sure that persons assigned to full-time safety positions are trained
before beginning or as soon as possible after assuming the job. MAJCOMs will manage and track all
safety personnel and required training to include AETC, AFIT, AFSC, OSHA Training Institute (OTI)
Courses through the use of a computer data base program. This program tracks an individual’s training
30                                                           AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


throughout his/her safety career. It identifies what courses have been taken, what courses are needed and

                                           FLIGHT SAFETY

7.1. Program Management. Each unit conducting or supporting flight operations must have a flight
safety program to support its mission.
   7.1.1. The host safety office is responsible for the base flight safety program.
   7.1.2. Tenant units coordinate their flight safety programs with the host to avoid duplication. If the
   host does not have a FSO authorization, the largest tenant with an authorization manages the base
   flight safety program. If neither the host nor the tenant has a FSO authorization, flight safety respon-
   sibilities revert to the host chief of safety.

7.2. Oversight Requirements:
   7.2.1. The FSO must conduct an annual assessment of all assigned flying units' flight safety pro-
   grams.
   7.2.2. The host FSO assesses tenant unit support of the host base program.
   7.2.3. The tenant's higher headquarters assesses the tenant's internal program.

7.3. Monitoring. The assigned FSO and FSNCO monitor flight-related facilities or operations as part of
a continuous quality-improvement program. Areas for monitoring include:
   7.3.1. Programs:

7.5. Aircraft Maintenance. Assigned FSOs and FSNCOs must work closely with aircraft maintenance
operations to fully integrate all flightline maintenance personnel into the unit’s flight safety program.
Like the flight crews, all flightline maintenance personnel should be briefed on aircraft mishaps. FSOs
and FSNCOs monitor maintenance areas for continuous quality improvement. These areas should
include:
     7.5.1. Debriefing procedures.
     7.5.2. Functional check flight procedures.
     7.5.3. Product Quality Deficiency Reporting System.
AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                       35

   7.5.5. Distribution of safety publications.
   7.5.6. Aircraft marshaling, fueling, and towing procedures.
   7.5.7. Ground engine-run/taxi training procedures.
   7.5.8. Wildlife and bird strike reporting.

7.6. Mishap Board Training. The FSO trains unit personnel identified to serve as basic aircraft mishap
investigation board members. Positions and qualification requirements are in AFI 91-204. MAJCOMs
determine the most effective interval and mode of training.

7.7. US Air Force Hazard Reporting (HR) and Hazardous Air Traffic Report i ng (HATR) Pro-
grams RCS: HAF-SE (AR) 7602. The FSO investigates HRs according to Chapter 4 and HATRs
according to Attachment 3.

7.8. Aero Club Operations. The host unit commander appoints a FSO as an advisor to the base Aero
Club. If the host unit does not have an assigned FSO, the commander obtains the assistance of a tenant
unit FSO to provide safety assistance to the Aero Club. If there is no FSO available, the commander
appoints a member of the ground safety staff. The host safety office reports Aero Club mishaps according
to AFI 91-204, AFI 34-217, Air Force Aero Club Program, and 49 CFR, chapter VIII, National Transpor-
tation Safety Board, part 830, as appropriate. The Chief of Safety for the installation possessing the Aero
Club aircraft will use the procedures in AFI 91-204 chapters 7 and 11 for reporting these mishaps and will
determine the safety personnel who will investigate the mishap. For mishap prevention purposes, all Aero
Club aircraft are considered appropriated fund assets. All reports will be forwarded to HQ AFSC/SEF
and HQ AFSVA/SVPAR. Any Air Force investigation conducted under AFI 91-204 fulfills the Air Force
mishap reporting requirements of AFI 34-217 and shall not take precedence over or interfere with civil
aviation authorities or agencies investigating a non-Air Force aircraft mishap.

7.9. Airfield Maintenance and Construction. FSOs and FSNCOs monitor routine airfield maintenance
and major construction projects. On major construction projects, the FSO reviews the initial plan for
compliance with AFJMAN 32-1013, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design, (formerly AFR 86-14),
and attends the preconstruction conference or briefing to consider if it will effect unit operations. Con-
sider these factors:
   7.9.1. The inspection of areas before use.
   7.9.2. The impact of maintenance and construction on daily flying schedule and emergency situa-
   tions.
   7.9.3. The communications between the tower and contractor and the availability of the contracting
   agent.
   7.9.4. Controlling vehicular traffic on the airfield and designating haul routes for contractor trucks.
   7.9.5. Briefing pilots and transient air crews with updated information.
   7.9.6. Establishing the minimum allowable distance between equipment and the runway.
   7.9.7. Marking obstructions, controlling foreign objects, and assigning hearing protection.

     7.9.8. Explosive safety criteria.
     7.9.9. The potential impact of construction on wildlife hazards to airfield operations.

7.10. Midair Collision Avoidance (MACA) Program. Units with flying programs must establish a
MACA program. The unit safety office is responsible for its administration. The FSO works closely with
the MAJCOM-determined OPR and other interested parties such as the Chief Air Traffic Control Opera-
tions Officer (CATCO), the Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC), the airspace manager, and
the local Flight Standards District Officer (FSDO), to establish a comprehensive MACA program. Tailor
the MACA program to meet local needs. Consider these key objectives when developing a MACA pro-
gram:
     7.10.1. Ensure the free flow of MACA information between host and tenant organizations, effective
     communication between base and local airport managers and fixed base operators, and actively sup-
     port the HATR Program.
     7.10.2. Provide educational programs to increase the use of available radar services among civil air-
     craft.
     7.10.3. Use the resources and services of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) FSDO accident
     prevention specialists.
     7.10.4. Develop appropriate maps and graphics showing the base radar services and routes. Distrib-
     ute the maps to all civil airlines and pilots, base fixed operators, airports and other flying operations
     that use the surrounding airspace.
     7.10.5. Establish procedures to control VFR aircraft and minimize the air-traffic hazards.
     7.10.6. Deconflict MTRs as much as possible and acquaint the flying public with the location, config-
     uration, speeds, and altitudes of the base MTR and military operating areas through military and FAA
     personnel.
     7.10.7. Ensure that arrival and departure routes (including stereo routes and profile descents) mini-
     mize conflicts with runway traffic, nearby airfields, and local flying areas.
     7.10.8. Evaluate the midair collision potential with civil airlines and work with operators of nearby
     airfields to reduce risk and minimize the hazards.
     7.10.9. Develop a MACA pamphlet.
     7.10.10. Units may combine MACA programs with other military organizations in a 50-mile range of
     their base. This will require more coordination efforts but will result in a better product to be used by
     the area’s civilian population.

7.11. Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Program. Includes all wildlife aircraft strike hazards.
     7.11.1. Responsibilities for establishing and administering the Air Force BASH Program.

            7.11.1.4.1. Establish a BASH plan that meets command operational requirements.
            7.11.1.4.2. Each installation with flying operations must develop a contingency plan that lists
            responsibilities and procedures for wildlife control.
            7.11.1.4.3. Establish a Bird Hazard Working Group (BHWG) consisting of organizations
            involved in airfield bird control, habitat management, operations and safety. The BHWG must
            meet at least semi-annually with minutes maintained. The vice wing commander or equivalent
            will chair the meeting.
            7.11.1.4.4. Develop a Bird Hazard Warning System to inform aircrews of possible flight haz-
            ards due to bird activity in local areas. Bird Watch Condition (BWC) codes will be used to
            communicate local bird activity along with location, number and type of birds. BWC codes
            are defined as:
            7.11.1.4.5. SEVERE: Bird activity on or immediately above the active runway or other spe-
            cific location representing high potential for strikes. Supervisors and aircrews must thor-
            oughly evaluate mission need before conducting operations in areas under condition
            SEVERE.
            7.11.1.4.6. MODERATE: Bird activity near the active runway or other specific location rep-
            resenting increased potential for strikes. BWC moderate requires increased vigilance by all
            agencies and supervisors and caution by aircrews.
            7.11.1.4.7. LOW: Bird activity on and around the airfield representing low potential for
            strikes.
            7.11.1.4.8. Designate Phase I and Phase II periods of bird activity based on historical birds
            activity information. Phase II represents heavy bird activity, normally associated with migra-
            tory season. Publish Phase I and II designations in the appropriate DoD Flight Information
            Publications.
     7.11.2. Base Level BASH Program. Hose Air Force, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard,
     installations with flying operations must establish a BASH program. The BASH program will include
     all tenant flying units. The BASH program requires complete documentation of local wildlife haz-
     ards, effects on missions and possible solutions. Tenant units located on an airfield that is not hosted
     by the Air Force, Air Force Reserve, or Air National Guard will establish a BASH program with the
AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                       39


   host activity (civilian airport, Naval Air Station, Federal airfield, etc.). The BASH program will doc-
   ument coordination with the host activity on reducing wildlife hazards.
       7.11.2.1. The host flight safety office will establish the BASH plan, to include, defining the nature
       and extent of wildlife hazards and implementation of the plan. Plan implementation may require
       environmental controls and changes to bird dispersal techniques and operational procedures.
       Cooperative agreements for managing fish and wildlife resources require coordination with state
       and Federal conservation agencies prior to implementation.
       7.11.2.2. BASH programs at overseas locations depend on host nation support and regulations.
       MAJCOMs will evaluate those plans to ensure the spirit of AFI 91-202 is complied with to the
       maximum extent possible.
       7.11.2.3. Grass Height. Mow airfield to maintain a uniform grass height between 7 and 14 inches.
       Each installation BHWG will establish airfield mowing zone boundaries. Installations located in
       arid climates where growing grass is difficult may develop natural vegetation on the airfield to
       limit attractiveness to wildlife. These situations require comprehensive vegetation/wildlife hazard
       management and will be reviewed individually by AFSC/SEFW for approval. MAJCOM safety
       offices may request a waiver to grass height restrictions from AFSC/SEFW.
       7.11.2.4. Obtain additional information on wildlife strike hazard reduction from AFPAM 91-212,
       BASH Management Techniques and on wildlife strike reporting from AFI 91-204, Safety Investi-
       gations and Reports.
   7.11.3. Technical Assistance. Technical assistance is available through the USAF BASH Team, HQ
   AFSC/SEFW, 9700 G Avenue SE, Suite 266, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5670. DSN 246-5674/5679/
   5681/0698 or Comm (505) 846-xxxx, fax x0684.

7.12. Other Activities Related to Flight Safety. The FSO attends Air Traffic Control Board meetings,
Foreign Object Damage Prevention Committee meetings, and Standardization/Evaluation and Training
review meetings.

                                           GROUND SAFETY

8.1. Program Management. This chapter contains the minimum requirements for safety offices at all
command levels. Ground safety mishap prevention efforts include both on- and off-duty activities.
     8.1.1. Each installation ground safety manager oversees and implements a total base safety program.
     8.1.2. Wing subordinate units and tenant organizations implement a program that supports the instal-
     lation program.
     8.1.3. Host safety offices may not impose host command-unique requirements on tenant units unless
     specified in the host-tenant agreement. Tenant units without full-time qualified safety authorizations
     and with fewer than 400 people receive the same safety services as wing subordinate units. For tenant
     units greater than 400 people that don't have their own full-time safety personnel specify safety sup-
     port through the host-tenant agreement.
     8.1.4. Ground safety managers will use AFPD 91-series, other AFI 91-series and applicable federal,
     state, and AF guidance to establish the installation ground safety program.

8.2. Host Ground Safety Staff Responsibilities:
     8.2.1. Ensure mishaps are investigated and reported in accordance with AFI 91-204.
        8.2.1.1. (Added-374AW) Supervisors will investigate and complete PACAF Form 161, Notifica-
        tion of Civilian/Military Injury or USAF Property Damage Ground Mishap Report, for all mis-
        haps. The form is self-explanatory. Immediately notify 374 AW/SE via telephone after mishap
        occurrence. Supervisors should also ensure their unit Safety representative (USR) is notified and
        follow squadron mishap procedures. The USR will review the form for completeness and forward
        it to the unit commander for review and signature. The form must be completely filled in with the
        mishap-involved person’s information. A complete mishap investigation worksheet form will be
        required for all military and on-duty civilian injuries, government motor vehicle (GMV), special
        purpose vehicle (SPV), aircraft ground damage, or United States Air Force property damage mis-
        haps regardless of reportability. The USR will ensure a draft copy of the PACAF Form 161 is for-
        warded to 374 AW/SE by the next duty day after the occurrence. The final completed PACAF
        Form 161, with commander’s signature, will be forwarded to 374 AW/SE no later than (NLT) 5
        duty days after the mishap. The completed draft form(s) may be faxed or hand carried to 374 AW/
        SE by the next duty day after the mishap.
     8.2.2. Manage the US Air Force base ground safety program, including operational and occupational
     safety, industrial safety, contractual safety requirements, sports and recreation safety, and traffic
     safety.

                                           SYSTEM SAFETY

9.1. System Safety Principles. System safety disciplines apply engineering and management principles,
criteria, and techniques throughout the life cycle of a system within the constraints of operational effec-
tiveness, schedule, and costs. The degree of safety achieved in a system is directly dependent upon gov-
ernment and contractor management emphasis.
   9.1.1. System safety is an inherent element of system design and is essential to supporting system
   requirements. Successful system safety efforts depend on clearly defined safety objectives and sys-
   tem requirements.
   9.1.2. System safety must be a planned, integrated, comprehensive effort employing both engineering
   and management resources.
   9.1.3. Follow this order of precedence to satisfy system safety requirements and resolve identified
   hazards according to Military Standard (MIL-STD)-882, System Safety Requirements:
       9.1.3.1. Design for minimum risk.
       9.1.3.2. Incorporate safety devices.
       9.1.3.3. Provide warning devices.
       9.1.3.4. Develop procedures and training.
NOTE: The degree of safety achieved in a system id directly dependent upon government and contractor
management emphasis

9.2. System Safety Program Requirements:
   9.2.1. System safety engineering is an element of the systems engineering function and a part of the
   mishap prevention program. System safety programs must meet the requirements of the latest revi-
   sion of MIL-STD-882 or Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Data Pacs. MIL-STD-882 has been
   deemed acquisition reform compliant by the Defense Standardization Improvement Council and shall
   be used on all applicable programs.
   9.2.2. Program managers must ensure that system safety engineering is an integral part of the systems
   engineering process and receives proper management attention. Program managers must provide
   direct lines of communication to the system safety staff to receive timely information on identified
   hazards that have high mishap potential.
   9.2.3. Management must ensure that safety offices monitor program requirements to identify and cor-
   rect hazards throughout the operational life of a system or facility to ensure hazards are identified
   through operational experience, mission changes, environmental effects, or system modification.
   Management must also ensure that safety staffs identify and control all hazards associated with
   decommissioning or disposal of a system.
   9.2.4. Program safety offices must clearly define and document risk acceptance authority during
   life-cycle system decisions. “Unacceptable” residual hazards (as defined by MIL-STD-882C, appen-
   dix A, figure 2) can only be accepted by the Air Force Acquisition Executive (AFAE). “Undesirable”
   residual hazards (same reference) can only be accepted by the program executive officer (PEO), des-
44                                                           AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


     ignated acquisition commander (DAC), or equivalent. In the case of a PEO program having an
     imbedded DAC sub-program (i.e., aircraft engine) which involves an unacceptable risk at the system
     (e.g., aircraft) level, the DAC will coordinate on the document and forward it to the PEO for approval,
     or for coordination and submittal to the AFAE, as applicable. For each unresolved "unacceptable" or
     "undesirable" hazard, the PM will prepare a written residual risk assessment or acceptance document
     describing the residual hazard and assessing its overall risk. This document will be coordinated
     through the center or laboratory safety office and the MAJCOM Safety Directorate. The AFAE, PEO,
     or DAC will show his/her acceptance of the residual hazard by counter-signing the prepared docu-
     ment.
     9.2.5. Requesting proposals and invitations during a bid for system acquisitions (including test, main-
     tenance and support, modification, and training equipment), you must include detailed and appropri-
     ate tailoring of the system safety tasks as outlined in MIL-STD-882.

   9.4.5. The program manager will be responsible for preparing minutes of SSG meetings and distrib-
   uting them to SSG members and attendees 30 days after the meeting. SSG minutes shall be sent to
   HQ AFSC and the owning command. If a SSG is not held on a major program within a year of the
   previous meeting from the last one an explanatory letter shall be sent toHQ AF/SESC.

9.5. Non-developmental Items. These items, formerly known as commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS)
acquisitions, require system safety programs to review usage history, verify intended use similarities,
evaluate differences, and plan for adequate safety evaluation for all Air Force-unique modifications or
changes in use. For example, Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) certification requirements are incre-
48                                                            AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


mentally implemented and may not apply to all models or year groups of similar aircraft. Operations
from military fields and or with military support equipment provide unique hazard opportunities that may
not have been considered in the original design. Exercise care in accepting FAA certification as a suffi-
cient indication for safety of the design.

9.6. Risk Assessment and Management. Accomplish an appropriate assessment/analysis of the safety
and operational risks associated with all modification proposals and acquisition and development efforts.
Program safety offices must ensure all necessary engineering and design data is produced and maintained
to adequately document the risk decisions made, the design changes incorporated to reduce or eliminate
hazards and any residual risks and hazards left in the system. Residual hazards and risk accepted and
signed off by the appropriate authorities should be thoroughly documented and periodically reviewed by
using and developing commands. This ensures that risk assessments are still appropriate and for available
possible correction as part of a later modification or redesign.
     9.6.1. Express risk as:
        9.6.1.1. Loss over a period of time.
        9.6.1.2. Loss over a number of events.
        9.6.1.3. Losses for a given population.
     9.6.2. Assess risk by determining:
        9.6.2.1. Recurrent hazards.
        9.6.2.2. Frequency of mishaps.
        9.6.2.3. Severity of mishaps.
        9.6.2.4. Exposure.
        9.6.2.5. Corrective actions that can eliminate mishaps or reduce risk.
(NOTE: See MIL-STD-882 for an explanation of the mishap-risk index method.)

9.7. SSEA. The SSEA program evaluates and approves new operations previously prohibited due to the
perceived risks. (Examples include hot pit refueling, integrated combat turn around [ICT], and concurrent
servicing.)
     9.7.1. SSEA of a proposed operation is performed by a highly qualified team under controlled condi-
     tions. The team conducts actual demonstrations and analysis of the operation to validate overall risk
     assessment and recommend actions. The SSEA team is normally chaired by the AFMC System
     Safety Office and includes experts from the developing, supporting, and operational commands.
     9.7.2. A using command requests a SSEA in writing to HQ AFMC/SES and informs HQ AFSC.
     Requests must include:
        9.7.2.1. A complete description of the proposed operation.
        9.7.2.2. Justification for accepting the increased risk.
        9.7.2.3. Recommended location and dates for the SSEA demonstrations.
        9.7.2.4. Identification of other DoD, Government, or foreign agencies that might be involved.

                                          WEAPONS SAFETY

10.1. Weapons Safety Program Management. The weapons safety program comprises three disci-
plines: explosives safety, missile safety, and nuclear surety.
     10.1.1. Units at and above squadron level with an explosives, missile, or nuclear mission must have a
     weapons safety program.
     10.1.2. The host coordinates weapons safety for the entire base. Tenant units implement mission
     unique mishap prevention programs where the host does not have a mission in that area. Tenant units
     must coordinate any additional program functions with the host to avoid duplication.

10.2. Weapons Safety Personnel Management: Weapons Safety personnel are normally from the
2WXXX or 2MXXX career fields. Civilian personnel with the appropriate occupational series (WG or
GS) experience in the safety career program will be used in all positions that do not have a military neces-
sity. It is the responsibility of the Chief of Safety to recruit, select, and man the Weapons Safety function
using Attachment 5 of this AFI.
     10.2.1. The MAJCOM Chief of Weapons Safety must have munitions or missile experience and have
     had a previous safety assignment.
        10.2.1.1. (Added-374AW) (PACAFSUP). (Added). Unit commanders with a weapons safety pro-
        gram must appoint, by letter, an additional-duty weapons safety representative. The unit must for-
        ward a copy of the appointment letter to 374 AW Weapons Safety (374 AW/SEW) and schedule
        weapons safety training for newly appointed representative.
     10.2.2. Upon completion of training and six months assignment in the Weapons Safety position, the
     Chief of Safety will ensure the individual in Weapons Safety is awarded the special experience identi-
     fier (SEI) 375 and a two-year assignment deferment is initiated through the Military Personnel Flight
     (MPF) if the individual is satisfactorily accomplishing Weapons Safety tasks.
     10.2.3. Individuals will be trained within 90 days of assuming the weapons safety position Initial
     training should be provided using the Introduction to Weapons Safety CD ROM provided by AFSC
     prior to attendance to the AETC Weapons Safety course.

10.3. Explosives Safety Standards. Air Force explosives safety standards are in AFMAN 91-201,
Explosives Safety Standards. Criteria for specific explosives are specified in technical publications and
other standard publications, such as command and local directives.

10.4. Weapons Safety Personnel:
     10.4.1. Monitor operations involving explosives to ensure Air Force units understand and comply
     with all safety standards (see Chapter 6 and paragraph 10.2.3.).
     10.4.2. Review waivers, exemptions, and deviations from established explosives safety criteria.
     10.4.3. Advise commanders of the increased damage potential these exceptions allow.
     10.4.4. Perform an operational risk assessment for each safety violation according to AFI 91-213.

  10.4.5. Ensure that units take compensatory measures to minimize mishaps and eliminate violations.
  10.4.6. Coordinate on all local written procedures affecting weapons operations and perform annual
  review.
  10.4.7. Submit an update for the Base Explosive Exception Matrix (BEEM) program to MAJCOM
  annually not later than 1 November. Negative inputs are not required when no changes exist. Submit
  changes as they occur, and during the annual update at the end of each fiscal year.
  10.4.8. Remain aware of planning and activities on the base that affect weapons safety, the WSM
  must conduct documented initial and annual reviews on munitions-related operating instructions,
  explosives test plans, deployment plans, OPLANs, OPORDs, and local directives involving the stor-
  age, handling, and inspection of nuclear weapons, missiles, or explosives. Review documentation

     agement programs for explosives.

10.6. Missile Safety. Missile systems include ground-launched or air-launched systems and subscale
remotely piloted vehicles and subscale drones. The aerospace vehicle, ground support and operational
equipment, personnel, and the operational environment are all sources of mishaps. Typically, missile
launch operations will be conducted from a Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB) range and will
comply with DoDD 3200.11 MRTFB range safety requirements as described in section 2.10.

10.7. Nuclear Surety. The goal of the nuclear surety program is to ensure that the Air Force designs,
maintains, transports, stores, and uses nuclear weapons with maximum safety, consistent with operational
requirements. AFI 91-101 contains nuclear surety program requirements.

(colonel or above) from each of the military departments. In addition, each military department must des-
ignate an alternate. Within the Air Force, HQ USAF/SE provides the primary and alternate members.
The DDESB establishes DoD explosives safety policy and conducts surveys of DoD installations and fur-
nishes a report to the installation commander. Answer these reports through channels to HQ USAF/SE.
See DoD 6055-.9-STD, The DoD Explosives Safety Board, for further discussion of the DDESB and
activities.

10.10. Weapons Safety Training.
   10.10.1. The MAJCOM weapons safety office must provide MAJCOM-unique training to their wing
   and NAF weapons safety personnel. MAJCOMs must ensure all weapons safety personnel in their
   command are properly trained. MAJCOMs ensure that bases or units develop standardized local les-
   son plans if intermediate or MAJCOM standardized plans are not provided. Nuclear surety training
   requirements are listed in AFI 91-101.
   10.10.2. The base or unit weapons safety manager conducts this training, which augments the job
   training provided by the supervisor. The weapons safety staff evaluates and monitors unit weapons
   safety, approves lesson plans and reviews them annually. All personnel (supervisory and nonsupervi-
   sory) who operate, handle, transport, maintain, load, or dispose of missiles, explosives, or nuclear
   weapons must receive initial weapons safety training before performing any of those tasks. Conduct
   recurring training annually thereafter, not later than the end of the month in which the initial training
   was conducted. Tailor the weapons safety training given to an individual to the specific duties and
   weapons systems. EXCEPTION: People who store and/or handle only the following are exempt
   from initial and refresher training: (a) Small arms ammunition, including cartridge-actuated tools in
   quantity-distance class/division 1.4; (b) Other class/division 1.4 items in their packaged configuration
   only. Personnel who will unpack and handle unpacked items still require training; (c) Document
   destroyers; (d) Small tear gas items (such as grenades); (e) Aircraft and facility fire extinguisher car-
   tridges.
       10.10.2.1. (Added-374AW) Each unit with a weapons safety program must conduct initial and
       annual explosive safety training and forward unit lesson plans to 374 AW/SEW annually for
       review. Units are responsible for ensuring all personnel complete this training prior to performing
       any explosive operations. The 374 AW/SE personnel will monitor compliance with this require-
       ment during spot and annual inspections of unit weapons safety programs.

10.11. Explosive Safety Council. This council, chaired by AFSC, is composed of the chiefs of weapons
safety, or their representatives, from each MAJCOM. The council discusses matters of mutual concern
that cross MAJCOM lines. The council must hold periodic meetings, generally following other meetings
in which most representatives are already present.

                                                 Chapter 11

                                             SPACE SAFETY

11.1. Space Safety Program Management. All units conducting space-related missions must have a
comprehensive space safety program.

11.2. Space Safety Program. Space safety consists of two elements: launch safety and orbital safety.
All units must tailor their space safety program to meet their mission requirements. Space systems range
from unique space support equipment to large boosters and satellites. Launches, ground support and
operational equipment, personnel, and the operational environment are all sources of potential mishaps.
Safe operations within the space environment are only possible if positive mishap prevention programs
are established and faithfully followed.
     11.2.1. Launch Safety. Modern launch vehicles operated by the Air Force have huge explosive
     potential, are unpiloted, and significantly less reliable than aircraft. Launch operations require a com-
     prehensive safety program to ensure safe operations. The launch safety program covers activities
     associated with the ground handling, launching, and preorbital operations of space systems. It also
     includes activities connected with the deployment, operation, reentry, and recovery (if required) of
     test vehicles or payloads that don't attain orbit (either planned or unplanned). Failure to follow all
     range and ground safety requirements could cause a launch mishap. NOTE: Missile safety programs
     cover intercontinental ballistic missile test launches.
        11.2.1.1. Major Range Test Facility Base (MRTFB) Range Safety. Typically, launch operations
        will be conducted from an MRTFB range and will comply with DoDD 3200.11 MRTFB range
        safety requirements as described in section 2.10.
        11.2.1.2. Launch Collision Avoidance. Operators will take appropriate action to minimize the
        risk of collisions with other satellites or space debris during launch.
        11.2.1.3. Mission Flight Control. Space launch operators will have adequate measures in place to
        ensure complete control over launch vehicles at all times. The surrounding public will not be
        exposed to undue risk.
     11.2.2. Orbital Safety. The extremely high cost of orbital assets and irrecoverable nature of orbital
     operations makes orbital mishap prevention a critical component of orbital systems. The orbital
     safety program covers activities, after orbital insertion, associated with testing and operating space
     vehicles in orbit or deep space, including reentry, recovery and disposal. Orbital safety begins in the
     earliest phases of a program when considerations of this section must be incorporated in the design
     phase. Safety of orbital system is the responsibility of the owner or operator. Orbital safety programs
     should cover, at a minimum, the following areas:
        11.2.2.1. Collision Avoidance. Operators will take appropriate action to minimize the risk of
        on-orbit collisions with other satellites or space debris. Collision avoidance should include main-
        taining separation of functional and non-functional space objects through coordinated launch win-
        dow management, accurate tracking and orbital element set updating; and coordination of planned
        orbit changes and evasive maneuvering to preserve operational space systems and to avoid the
        generation of additional space debris
AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                            55


       11.2.2.2. Directed Energy Clearing House. Programs or experiments using directed energy, either
       ground or space-based, shall take appropriate action to minimize hazards or interference with
       spacecraft or the general public and property on the earth’s surface or in the atmosphere.
       11.2.2.3. Orbital Debris Minimization. Orbital systems shall be designed to minimize the gener-
       ation of orbital debris during and after their service life.
           11.2.2.3.1. Booster disposal. Space vehicle boosters should be designed and planned to min-
           imize hazards to future vehicles and the ground when their mission is complete. At a mini-
           mum vehicles should reenter the atmosphere or be moved into a disposal orbit at the end of its
           useful life where they will be less likely to interfere with operational spacecraft.
           11.2.2.3.2. Orbital vehicle end-of-life safing. Vehicles should safely reenter the atmosphere or
           be moved into a disposal orbit at the end of its useful life where it will be less likely to interfere
           with operational spacecraft. End-of-life safing actions for systems disposed of in space
           include, but are not limited to: venting all pressure vessels, safing batteries, safing any remain-
           ing ordnance systems and turning off any transmitters.
       11.2.2.4. Space Environment. Orbital systems shall be designed to minimize damage due to nat-
       ural phenomena such as meteoroids, solar radiation, spacecraft charging and high energy cosmic
       radiation, solar flares, etc.

11.3. Space Safety Training. MAJCOMs must ensure that space safety offices provide adequate training
to all individuals involved in space operations. Tailor safety training to particular systems and the individ-
ual's specific duties. MAJCOMs must ensure that lesson plans are developed to implement intermediate
or MAJCOM guidance.
   11.3.1. Space Safety Managers (SSM), Orbital Safety Officers (OSO), and Space System Safety
   Engineer Training. Space safety personnel in these positions should have received the Introduction
   to Space Safety Course, and the Launch or Orbital Safety Management course appropriate to their unit
   mission and be experienced in the unit mission. Training should also include system safety analysis
   or system safety management courses, as well as orientation to the applicable areas of space safety
   covered under paragraph 11.2. above. Additional mission-specific training should be specified by the
   MAJCOM or unit.
   11.3.2. Launch Safety Training. Launch safety training augments the job training provided by the
   supervisor. Unit commanders ensure this training is developed and conducted in addition to job train-
   ing. The unit safety staff evaluates and monitors unit launch safety, approves lesson plans and reviews
   them annually. All personnel (supervisory and nonsupervisory) who operate, handle, transport, main-
   tain, or monitor space launch systems must receive initial launch safety training before performing
   any of those tasks. Conduct recurring training annually thereafter, not later than the end of the month
   in which the initial training was conducted. Tailor the launch safety training given to an individual to
   the specific duties and launch systems. MAJCOMs ensure that bases or units develop standardized
   local lesson plans if intermediate or MAJCOM standardized plans are not provided. Launch safety
   training may be given by USRs or qualified unit personnel.
   11.3.3. Orbital Safety Training. Orbital safety training augments the job training provided by the
   supervisor. Unit commanders ensure this training is developed and conducted in addition to job train-
   ing. The unit safety staff evaluates and monitors unit orbital safety, approves lesson plans and reviews
   them annually. All personnel (supervisory and nonsupervisory) who operate maintain, or monitor

     orbital systems must receive initial orbital safety training before performing any of those tasks. Con-
     duct recurring training annually thereafter, not later than the end of the month in which the initial
     training was conducted. Tailor the orbital safety training given to an individual to the specific duties
     and orbital systems. MAJCOMs ensure that bases or units develop standardized local lesson plans if
     intermediate or MAJCOM standardized plans are not provided. Orbital safety training may be given
     by USRs or qualified unit personnel.

11.4. Space Safety Council. This council, chaired by AFSC, is composed of the chiefs of space safety, or
their representatives, from each MAJCOM. The council discusses matters of mutual concern that cross
MAJCOM lines. The council must hold periodic meetings, generally following other meetings in which
most representatives are already present.

11.5. Space Nuclear Surety. The space nuclear surety program ensures that radioactive sources and
nuclear power systems used in space are designed, developed, built, maintained, stored, handled,
launched, and used (including final disposition) with the maximum safety and security consistent with
operational requirements. AFI 91-110 for nuclear safety review and launch approval requirements and

                                       0X1 INTERVIEW PLAN

A2.1. Requirement. It is critical for the Air Force to continually develop and manage a professional
safety force. Standardized interviewing ensures an effective ground safety program. Complete safety
specialty descriptions are in AFMAN 36-2108.

A2.2. USAF Retraining Advisory Notes . USAF Retraining Advisory notes 410, 411, and 412 apply to
the safety career field.
   A2.2.1. Note 410--Base Level OPR Requirement. The OPR functionally responsible for this AFSC
   must conduct a personal interview to evaluate entry qualifications that cannot be verified from person-
   nel records or by other means. Send interview results to HQ AFSC/SER with the member's applica-
   tion or attach a statement that no OPR is available in the immediate locale.
   A2.2.2. Note 411. Certification by the commander or staff agency head assigned responsibility for
   the retraining in AFSC must accompany the application.
   A2.2.3. Note 412--MAJCOM OPR Requirement. The MAJCOM OPR functionally responsible
   for this AFSC must review the application and furnish a recommendation to MAJCOM training offi-
   cials to help evaluate whether approving the request is in the best interest of the US Air Force and the
   member. NOTE: For more information on US Air Force training advisory notes, contact the base per-
   sonnel formal training section.

A2.3. 1S0X1 Retrainee Interview Checklist. The host safety staff must use the following 1S0X1
Retrainee Interview Checklist when interviewing potential retrainees for the safety career field. The staff
may add other items to the checklist to fit local needs. This interview process helps ensure that only
retrainee applicants with a high probability of success enter the safety career field. Interviewers must
include specific comments on each checklist item in the "After the Interview" section in the recommenda-
tion letter and a statement that all checklist items under "Preparation" and "The Interview" were com-
pleted.
   A2.3.1. Preparation:
       A2.3.1.1. Verify that the candidate possesses the mandatory prerequisites specified in AFMAN
       36-2108. To enter the safety career field, candidates must have:
           A2.3.1.1.1. A high school diploma.
           A2.3.1.1.2. A physical profile of 32222.
           A2.3.1.1.3. Attained the grade of Staff Sergeant
           A2.3.1.1.4. Normal color vision.
           A2.3.1.1.5. An Airman Qualifying Examination (AQE) score in the general category of 55 or
           higher. NOTE: Rather than waive points for those candidates whose AQE scores are too low,
           suggest that they retake the AQE test to raise their scores. The Air Force considers a candi-
           date's willingness to retake the exam as an indication of his or her desire to cross-train for the
           safety field.

           A2.3.1.2.7. Check the candidate's driving record.
           A2.3.1.2.8. Determine any problems that would preclude TDY or overseas assignments.
     A2.3.2. The Interview:
        A2.3.2.1. Set a convenient time and give the interview your full attention. Secure a quiet place to
        conduct the interview. Make the individual comfortable and let him or her talk.
        A2.3.2.2. Ask the candidate to write a short paragraph telling why he or she wants to retrain into

      HAZARDOUS AIR TRAFFIC REPORT (HATR) PROGRAM RCS: HAF-SE (AR) 7602

A3.1. General:
     A3.1.1. HATR information is vital to Air Force flight safety. It is administered by the unit safety
     office and is not designed to be a disciplinary mechanism for reporting or correcting violations of the
     Federal Aviation Regulations or any Air Force directives. The sole purpose of data collected under
     the HATR program is for mishap prevention. HATR reports are not privileged information and may be
     released outside the US Air Force. All reports will be investigated.

A3.2. HATR Reporting
     A3.2.1. Reportable Incidents
        A3.2.1.1. NMAC: Aircrew took abrupt evasive action to avoid a collision or would have taken
        evasive action if circumstances allowed. NOTE: The term AIRMISS is often used in Europe for
        such incidents.
        A3.2.1.2. Hazardous air traffic conditions: Less than required separation existed between aircraft
        IAW all applicable directives or any occurrence that did or could compromise flight safety.
        A3.2.1.3. Communications or navigation aids (NAVAID) anomalies: Any equipment indication
        that did or could contribute to a hazardous air traffic condition.
        A3.2.1.4. Hazardous procedures: Any system, publication, or directive that did or could contrib-
        ute to a hazardous air traffic condition.
        A3.2.1.5. Hazardous ground incidents: Any occurrence, including vehicle operations, on the
        movement area that endangered an airborne aircraft or an aircraft on the ground.
     A3.2.2. Reporting Procedures:
        A3.2.2.1. Anyone aware of a reportable incident files a HATR, RCS: HAF-SE (AR) 7602.
        A3.2.2.2. Report the details on AF Form 651 within 24 hours to the base safety office if you are
        at the Air Force base where the incident occurred. Submit the form to the nearest US Air Force
        Base Safety Office after landing if the incident occurred during flight. Unit commanders will
        ensure AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR), is available to aircrew at base opera-
        tions facilities, flying squadron operations offices, in trip kits, and in US Air Force air traffic con-
        trol facilities.
        A3.2.2.3. If you have a NMAC, inform the nearest air traffic control agency or flight service sta-
        tion and provide the following information:
            A3.2.2.3.1. Your identification or call sign.
            A3.2.2.3.2. Time and place (name of NAVAID, radial, and distance) of the incident.
            A3.2.2.3.3. Altitude or flight level.
            A3.2.2.3.4. Description of the other aircraft.
AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008                                                                   67


          A3.2.2.3.5. Advise the agency that you intend to file a written Near Midair Collision Report
          and request that the controllers save all available data.

A3.3. Unit Safety Office Responsibilities
   A3.3.1. Within 24 hours after being notified of the incident, the safety office receiving the HATR
   determines which safety office is responsible for the investigation. Follow this order of priority:
       A3.3.1.1. The US Air Force safety office at the base where the incident occurred.
       A3.3.1.2. The safety office at the originator's home station, if there is no US Air Force safety
       office where the incident occurred.
       A3.3.1.3. The overseas MAJCOM, if host nation air traffic services (ATS) or foreign aircraft are
       involved.
       A3.3.1.4. When flying in a NATO environment, comply with NATO STANAG 3750, “Reporting
       and Investigation of Airmiss Incidents”, except do not report the name of the aircraft commander.
   A3.3.2. Notify the safety office responsible for investigating the HATR and mail or fax a copy of AF
   Form 651 to them. NOTE: If the incident occurred overseas and the HATR is filed at a base located
   in the United States, notify the overseas investigating office by message. This report is designated
   emergency status Code D. Discontinue reporting during emergency conditions. During MINIMIZE,
   use regular mail. Don't assign a report identifier.

A3.4. Immunity: To encourage reporting, individuals submitting HATRs are granted immunity from
disciplinary action if:
   A3.4.1. Their violation was not deliberate.
   A3.4.2. They committed no criminal offense.
   A3.4.3. No mishap occurred.
   A3.4.4. They properly reported the incident.

A3.5. Investigation and Evaluation Procedures:
   A3.5.1. The Investigating Safety Office will follow these procedures:
       A3.5.1.1. Assign a report identifier to use with all correspondence relating to the incident. The
       identifier contains:
          A3.5.1.1.1. The date of the incident (year, month, day).
          A3.5.1.1.2. The wing or base designation.
          A3.5.1.1.3. The serial number of the report (for example, HATR 91-12-16 63 AW-01). The
          serial number starts with number 1 at the beginning of each fiscal year. NOTE: ASAP users
          use assigned report identifiers.
       A3.5.1.2. Determine which organizations were involved and request the proper safety office to
       help in the investigation. Notify:
          A3.5.1.2.1. The unit if local base aircraft were involved
68                                                           AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


            A3.5.1.2.2. The base ATS management if US Air Force ATS or NAVAIDs were involved.
            A3.5.1.2.3. The FAA facility or FSDO if FAA ATS or civil aircraft were involved. NOTE:
            Contact the FAA Air Force Representative (AFREP) for help in notifying the proper facility or
            FSDO. See Table A3.1. In some cases, the local US Air Force office of primary responsibil-
            ity (OPR) for ATS can provide a direct link with the FAA but communications with the FAA
            by a local safety office should normally be through the AFREP.
            A3.5.1.2.4. The appropriate US Defense Attachè Office if the HATR occurred overseas and
            information about civil aircraft or host air traffic facilities is not available through normal
            channels.
        A3.5.1.3. Send a HATR preliminary or a preliminary/final message within 10 work days. See
        Figure A3.1. for the proper format. Refer to Table A3.2. for correct addressees. This report is
        designated emergency status Code D. Discontinue reporting during emergency conditions. Dur-
        ing MINIMIZE, use regular mail.
        A3.5.1.4. If the investigation is not completed within 10 working days, send a supplemental mes-
        sage every 90 days to the same addressees as the preliminary message. Continue the supplemental
        messages until the investigation is closed and a final message is sent.
     A3.5.2. Units that provide air traffic services must:
        A3.5.2.1. Work closely with the base safety office throughout the investigation.
        A3.5.2.2. Make sure the report clearly explains the reason(s) why the incident occurred and show
        how the corrective actions will prevent a recurrence.
     A3.5.3. Air Force Representative (AFREP) at FAA Regional Offices reviews all HATRs and pro-
     vides help when requested.
     A3.5.4. MAJCOM safety offices, with the assistance from the OPR for AETC, establish procedures
     to carry out the HATR program. The MAJCOM safety office will determine if a reportable incident
     occurred. If not, notify the local unit safety office and AFSC.
     In addition, overseas MAJCOMs:
        A3.5.4.1. Issue supplemental procedures to carry out this program that agree with foreign air traf-
        fic control agreements in their area of responsibility.
        A3.5.4.2. Determine which agency should investigate HATRs involving host nation aircraft or
        ATS.
        A3.5.4.3. Ensure unit safety offices fully investigate the reports.
     A3.5.5. Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) OPR for ATS:
        A3.5.5.1. Receive and evaluate all HATRs for trends and concerns that may affect Air Force ATS.
        A3.5.5.2. Provide AFSC, Aviation Safety Directorate, recommendations for resolving trends and
        concerns not under Air Force jurisdiction..
        A3.5.5.3. Assist AFSC in HATR summary development.
     A3.5.6. The AFSC OPR for HATRs:
        A3.5.6.1. Administer the program and ensure that safety offices fully investigate the reports. .

NOTES:
1. Addresses may change. Contact the ATS facility closest to you or your AFREP for current addresses. If the addressee can-
not receive electronic mail, use FAX or normal mail. Manager Flight Standards Divisions (FSD) and Air Traffic Divisions
(ATD) share the same mailing address as the AFREP (table 1). Substitute FSD or ATD for AFREP and change the office num-
ber to 200 for FSDs and 500 for ATDs.
2. Consider the ATS or the ownership of the aircraft and the users of the scheduled air space involved, if any.

                                         MISHAP RESPONSE

A4.1. General. Pre-mishap response planning by safety staffs must address appropriate participation in
all base-level responses, including:
   A4.1.1. Major Accidents
   A4.1.2. Hazardous materials accidents
   A4.1.3. Natural disasters
   A4.1.4. Nuclear weapons accidents
   A4.1.5. Conventional Munitions Incidents

A4.2. Base OPlan 32-1. The basic response planning document is Base OPlan 32-1. It consists of sepa-
rate annexes for Major Peacetime Accidents (Annex A), Natural Disasters (Annex B), Enemy Attack
(Annex C), and Distribution (Annex A). The host safety office should be reflected in Annex Z and sup-
ported by tenants as locally required. A “Safety” tab is required for Annexes A and B; since losses due to
hostile action are not investigated as safety mishaps, safety personnel normally support Annex C activities
only at the request of the installation commander.

A4.3. Planning Factors (All Accidents/Incidents/Unusual Occurrences).
   A4.3.1. Disaster Response Force (DRF).
       A4.3.1.1. The DRF is made up of the Disaster Control Group (DCG), the base command post,
       unit control centers, and specialized teams. If organizational manning permits, the host safety
       office should plan to establish a “unit control center” to coordinate safety activities between the
       accident scene and the supporting installation. If manning does not permit a separate safety unit
       control center, the safety staff must be reachable through the base command post.
       A4.3.1.2. Upon notification of a major peacetime accident, the safety staff typically begins to
       assemble an interim safety investigation board (SIB) in accordance with AFI 91-204. This pro-
       cess should be kept separate from participation in the DRF or Disaster Control Group (see below)
       if possible. If manning permits, the interim SIB should assemble at a location away from the acci-
       dent scene until the interim SIB members can be assigned to specific tasks.
   A4.3.2. Disaster Control Group (DCG). The DCG responds to peacetime major accidents and nat-
   ural disasters to provide on-scene command and control of USAF military resources and functional
   expertise. Normally, the DCG consists of the following members: (see AFI 32-4001 for more
   details).
       A4.3.2.1. On-Scene Commander (OSC)
       A4.3.2.2. Civil Engineer
       A4.3.2.3. Fire Department
       A4.3.2.4. Security Police
       A4.3.2.5. Medical Representative
76                                                           AFI91-202_374AWSUP_I 11 APRIL 2008


       A4.3.2.6. Bioenvironmental Engineer
       A4.3.2.7. Maintenance
       A4.3.2.8. Munitions
       A4.3.2.9. Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD)
       A4.3.2.10. Staff Judge Advocate
       A4.3.2.11. Services
       A4.3.2.12. Public Affairs
       A4.3.2.13. Communications-Computers
       A4.3.2.14. Safety
       A4.3.2.15. Weather
       Ideally, the safety representative to the DCG should not be responsible for assembling the interim
       SIB.

A4.4. Source Documents for Specific Planning Criteria. The two primary sources of detailed plan-
ning guidance for safety staffs are AFMAN 32-4004, Emergency Response Operations, and AFP 127-1,
USAF Guide to Mishap Investigation. The former contains an “Accident Response Checklist” for DCG
safety representative and guidance for developing a unit control center checklist; the latter describes spe-
cialized equipment requirements and an expanded set of tasks for interim SIB members.

A4.5. Safety Response to Other than Major Peacetime Accidents. Some mishaps may not warrant a
full activation of the DRF. However, the safety staff may need some DCG elements to support investiga-
tion of these less severe incidents, such as Combat Camera or Civil Engineering Specialists. Each safety
staff should consult with their supporting base readiness flight (disaster preparedness function) to deter-
mine how to formally provide for partial DCG support when the full DRF is not activated.

A4.6. Munitions Rapid Response Team. OO-ALC/LIW has developed a conventional munitions rapid
response team to support Air Force units throughout the world anytime a munitions incident occurs. This
team is made up of experts (engineers, equipment specialists, program managers, and safety personnel)
from the conventional weapons and munitions programs. These personnel are able to travel anywhere in
the world within 24 to 48 hours to assist in determining the cause of a failure. If your MAJCOM or unit
has an incident, and this team’s help is desired, contact OO-ALC/LIW to request support by calling DSN
777-5156, 5053, 5055, or 4865 during duty hours. If after duty hours contact Hill AFB Command Post at
DSN 777-3007 or Commercial (801) 777-3007.

                               WEAPONS SAFETY MANNING PLAN

A5.1. Requirement. It is critical for the Air Force to recruit strong performers into Weapons Safety.
Weapons Safety positions are filled by 2WXXX and 2MXXX NCOs using a Special Experience Identifier
(SEI). Most assigned individuals will be assigned to Weapons Safety only once, for a two to three year
period, in their career. Superior performers may be assigned two or more times in increasingly challeng-
ing Weapons Safety positions. It is therefore essential that candidates be fast learning, highly motivated
individuals.

A5.2. Recruitment. The above requirement makes it necessary for individuals in the safety office to
actively recruit, whenever possible, when they are in units with the appropriate AFSCs. Also, the Chief
of Safety should be in close contact with the Logistics Group and appropriate squadron commanders iden-
tifying well suited candidates. Wing staff experience, the ability to work both flight line and munitions
storage issues, and an opportunity to broaden an individuals experience by learning the safety discipline,
are all reasons for an individual to volunteer for Weapons Safety. The communicative skills and wide
range of responsibilities inherent in the position are all desirable abilities for a potential senior NCO to
have.

A5.3. Selection Process. When an individual volunteers to be assigned to Weapons Safety they should
go to the Safety office on the base they are assigned and be interviewed by the Chief of Safety. The Chief
of Safety, using the interview process in Attachment 2 of this AFI, will tailor the process for Weapons
Safety, working closely with the Chief of Weapons Safety. Names of candidates who are well suited for
assignment will be forwarded by the Chief of Safety to the MPF. The MPF will then notify AFPC of the
individuals eligibility and desires. Prior to assignment if possible, the MAJCOM will send the individual
TDY to the Weapons Safety school. If possible the TDY should be accomplished in conjunction with the
PCS.

A5.4. SEI Assignment. All individuals assigned to Weapons Safety must be trained within 90 days after
assignment to Weapons Safety. If an individual arrives at the safety office without training, work with the
MAJCOM to immediately assign the individual to training. Upon completion of training and six months
in the assignment, generate SEI certification paperwork. At that time the Chief of Safety, in coordination
with the individual and the Chief of Weapons Safety, will award the SEI to individuals who have demon-
strated the skills needed to be assigned to a more challenging Weapons Safety assignment. This is highly
desirable, since many assignments are at higher headquarters positions.
