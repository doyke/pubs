1.1. General Purpose. This instruction establishes responsibilities, policies and procedures
applicable to all Air Control Squadrons (ACS), Test Squadrons (TS), and Field Training Units
(FTU) that employ or train utilizing TYQ-23 Modular Control Equipment (MCE). The
remaining unit instructions contain detailed procedures and criteria for the evaluation of
individuals assigned operations duties by specific systems.
   1.1.1. Scope. This instruction outlines the procedures applicable to the conduct of operations
   of the Control and Reporting Center (CRC), normally equipped with the MCE weapons
   systems. With the complementary references, this volume prescribes standard operating
   procedures for all CRC operations crews and all management levels concerned with the
   operation of CRC equipment.
       1.1.1.1. In the absence of additional guidance, CRC mission crews operating equipment
       other than MCE equipment will use this volume as baseline for conduct of operations, at
       the discretion of the deployed Commander (CC), Major Command (MAJCOM), or other
       authorities.
       1.1.1.2. This instruction does not provide tactics, techniques, or procedures (TTP) for
       employing the CRC in a combat environment. Guidance on tactical employment of the
       CRC can be found in AFTTP 3-1, Theater Air Control Squadron (TACS) and AFTTP 3-
       3, Theater Air Ground System (TAGS) and related volumes.
1.2. Mission Crew Responsibility. This volume, in conjunction with other governing
directives, prescribes procedures for employing the CRC under most circumstances. It is not a
substitute for sound judgment. Procedures not specifically addressed may be accomplished IAW
theater guidance. Deviations will be reported through the Operational Chain-of-Command
Tactical Control (TACON) authority.
1.3. Waiver Authority. Unless specifically noted otherwise in the appropriate section, waiver
authority for requirements of this volume is the applicable MAJCOM/A3. Forward waiver
requests through appropriate channels to the MAJCOM/A3 for approval. All approvals will
include an ―expiration date‖. MAJCOMs will forward a copy of all approved waivers to
AF/A3O-AYO.
   1.3.1. Requests for waivers must contain a complete explanation of why the waiver is
   required and corrective actions to be taken.
   1.3.2. All waivers for ACC and USAFE consideration will be forwarded through channels to
   the applicable MAJCOM.
       1.3.2.1. When it is necessary to protect the crew or aircraft from a situation not covered
       by this Air Force Instruction (AFI), the Squadron Commander has ultimate authority and
       responsibility for courses of action.
       1.3.2.2. Report all deviations or exceptions without waiver through channels to
       MAJCOM Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR).

                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Mission Planning Guidelines. The Squadron/Unit Director of Operations (DO) will direct
the execution of the unit’s operations schedule. The DO will ensure that all operations personnel
provide crews with the requisite support to plan and execute their mission. The DO will ensure
crews/mission planners have no barriers to mission planning and ensure that every mission is
thoroughly planned, briefed, executed, and debriefed.
   2.1.1. Mission Planning Options. The DO will normally choose from three mission planning
   profiles when executing the daily in-garrison operating schedule or the Air Tasking Order
   (ATO) cycle: prior-day mission planning, same-day mission plan/execute, and Mission
   Planning Cell (MPC) operations.
       2.1.1.1. Prior-day mission planning. Mission planning is held the duty day prior to
       execution. This option is preferred for Mission Training Exercises (MTE).
       2.1.1.2. Same-day mission planning. Mission planning is held the same duty day as the
       operation event. This option is preferred for 24-hour operations in the absence of a MPC.
   2.1.2. Mission Planning Cell (MPC) operations. Mission planning is conducted by a
   dedicated MPC in accordance with Section 2.9 and Attachment 6 of this instruction. This
   option is preferred for 24-hour operations when manning is available.
       2.1.2.1. The intent of mission planning is to ensure the crew is properly prepared to
       execute the tasked mission, to have on hand all applicable mission materials, and debrief
       and capture applicable lessons learned. The use of slides, forms, or other administrative
       products is a means to the end of preparing the crew, but is not necessary in order to
       conduct mission planning.
2.2. Responsibilities. As the Officer in Charge (OIC), the responsibility for mission planning
rests with the Mission Crew Commander (MCC). Operations crews may perform their own
mission planning or units may utilize MPCs in order to meet mission planning requirements. In
any case, qualified individuals will be designated to perform mission planning and/or
briefings/debriefings. Units will develop specific procedures to ensure all mission crew members
are thoroughly prepared for each duty shift or event.
2.3. Forms and Logs. The DO ensures AF Form 4145, Daily Activity Log, AF Form 4146,
Mission Briefing Guide, DD Form 1972, Joint Tactical Air Strike Request, DD Form 1975, Joint
Tactical Air Reconnaissance/Surveillance Request, and Forward Air Control – Close Air Support
(FAC CAS) 9-Line Briefing Form are readily available to meet operational requirements in
support of CRC daily operations.
Note: FTUs will use only AF Forms 4145 and 4146.
   2.3.1. AF Form 4145, Daily Activity Log. The MCC or DO designee is responsible for the
   Daily Activity Log. The form is required to be completed and signed at the completion of
   each operations crew shift and forwarded to the DO for approval and signature. The daily
   activity log provides a complete summary of all crew operations for a particular shift and is
   an important tool for data correlation and analysis.

    2.3.2. AF Form 4146, Mission Briefing Guide. Use the Mission Briefing Guide to brief
    missions, record mission results, and serve as a record of unit control activities. Air Weapons
    Officers/Weapons Directors (WDs) use the form for all control activities conducted and
    forwarded to the MCC or crew leader for review and attach to AF Form 4145, Daily Activity
    Log.
    2.3.3. Operations Logbook. The operations logbook is the unit’s official record of events that
    occurred during major theater operations, real world contingency operations or in-garrison
    training (live/DMO or simulated). The purpose is to maintain an accurate and detailed record
    of all significant events pertaining to operations occurring during each crew shift or event. Of
    primary importance are specific events that may result in subsequent investigations.
    Secondarily, information contained in the logbook may result in significant lessons learned.
    The DO will ensure that the operations logbook is properly maintained IAW Attachment 5.
       2.3.3.1. The operations logbook, while not a mission planning document, will be
       reviewed prior to assumption of mission operations responsibility for pertinent
       information regarding equipment status, lessons learned, and other pertinent mission
       information from previous days in connection with current mission operations.
2.4. Briefings/Debriefings. As the OIC, the MCC will brief/debrief all crewmembers to ensure
safe/effective mission accomplishment. Local briefing guides (developed IAW Attachment 3 and
Attachment 4 of this instruction) will be used to provide a reference list of items that apply to a
particular mission and will be used as the basis for briefings/debriefings. Brief items in any
logical sequence; and those items formally documented in publications, such as local operations
standards, may be briefed as ―standard.‖ All crew members will attend briefings/debriefing
unless specifically excused by the MCC unless local procedures dictate otherwise.
    2.4.1. In-Garrison (Training) Operations. While the CRC is in-garrison, the unit is less likely
    to be conducting 24-hour operations. Mission planning will be oriented toward the event or
    scenario. Note that the event or scenario can be a live-fly event (fighter support), a tactical
    data link (TDL) exercise, a MTE, or any other scheduled training event.
    2.4.2. Contingency (24-hour) Operations. While the CRC is conducting contingency or
    exercise operations on a 24-hour basis, mission planning will be conducted oriented towards
    the duty shift coming on at the time of the Step Briefing. During 24-hour operations, the
    MCC coming on shift or the MPC Chief will coordinate with the current on-position MCC to
    gather situational awareness on the current operation and will conduct mission planning to
    cover the period of the duty shift. In most 24-hour operations, only a crew step brief will be
    conducted prior to positional change-over.
    2.4.3. Debriefings. Regardless of using in-garrison or contingency operations mission
    planning guidelines, the MCC will conduct a crew debrief to capture lessons learned and
    improve crew and system effectiveness. Once an MPC chief has been appointed, the MPC
    chief will be responsible for tracking lessons learned and briefing them to follow-on crews as
    soon as possible after the crew event.
2.5. Mission Briefing Requirements. The squadron CC, as applicable, may waive
requirements contained in this paragraph if deemed necessary to accomplish a specific mission.
    2.5.1. In-Garrison Operation Briefings. During in-garrison operations the planning/briefing
    sequence will be 1) Pre-mission planning, 2) Section specialized briefings, and 3) Step brief.
AFI13-1CRCV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                      9


   The pre-mission briefing will normally take place after the crew reports on the day of the
   scheduled missions. Specialized briefings are conducted as required by each section to cover
   unique requirement within that section (e.g., surveillance section). The step brief will be
   conducted when and where the situation and timing allows for the sole purpose of capturing
   and disseminating any last minute or developing information critical to the mission crew. It
   can be conducted one-on-one, by section, or to the entire crew.
   2.5.2. Contingency Operation Briefings. During contingency operations, the
   planning/briefing sequence is generally the same as in-garrison operations, but can be limited
   to a step or on-position briefing. The MCC determines the briefing requirements and will be
   supported by the MPC.
   2.5.3. Crew Planning. MCCs will use Attachment 3 and Attachment 4 and locally
   generated crew aids as guides to plan and brief the applicable items to the crew.
NOTE: Units will develop and document guidance for items that are commonly briefed as
―standard‖. The purpose of unit or local standards is to reduce the briefing time of administrative
tasks to allow for concentration on the mission. In no case do these procedures relieve the
operations crew of the responsibility to comply with USAF directives. Operations crews will use
these procedures unless conditions, objectives or execution dictate the MCC/MPC Chief to brief
as ―non-standard.‖
2.6. Mission Planning Task Overview. The following items will be accomplished during
mission planning by the MPC or applicable duty functions if the MPC is not operational.
   2.6.1. MCC will ensure mission activities are planned according to applicable checklists and
   guides.
   2.6.2. Objectives. MCC will develop crew objectives for the event or duty shift. Air
   Surveillance Officers (ASO) and Senior Directors (SD) will develop objectives that support
   the crew objectives within their sections.
   2.6.3. MCC, SD, ASO, Data Systems Technician (DST), Interface Control Technician (ICT)
   and Battle Staff Coordinator (BSC) and CC will develop a communication plan to ensure
   accomplishment of mission requirements.
   2.6.4. The DST will coordinate all computer software requirements. Minimum software
   requirements will be IAW local operating procedures. Database inputs from individual
   sections should be provided to the DST well prior to the step brief.
   2.6.5. The ASO, Air Surveillance Technician (AST), or their designated appointee will
   obtain equipment status from the appropriate Maintenance Operations Center (MOC)/Job
   Control (JC). During contingency operations the BSC will be the point of contact with the
   MOC/JC and will record all statuses in the logbook.
   2.6.6. The MCC will assess impact of equipment limitations and adjust tasking as necessary.
   The MCC will conduct a final review of mission crew planning.
   2.6.7. Details on mission planning flow can be found in Appendix 3 and Appendix 4 of this
   instruction.
10                                                              AFI13-1CRCV3 21 JANUARY 2010


     2.6.8. For local live flying training operations, the Air Weapons Officer (AWO)/Weapons
     Director (WD) will coordinate to receive a briefing from the flight leads of all missions to be
     controlled.
2.7. Local Checklists/Crew Aids. Locally produced checklists and crew aids will include as a
minimum:
     2.7.1. Mission planning checklists (as required).
     2.7.2. Briefing guides (as required).
2.8. Theater Procedures/Crew Aids. Units specifically tasked to support an area of operations
(AO) will develop theater procedure crew aids (classified/unclassified) and make them available
to the crew upon deployment to the theater. As a minimum, these aids will include:
     2.8.1. Communications plans.
     2.8.2. Crew positional actions/procedures.
     2.8.3. ID criteria and procedures (ID Matrix)
     2.8.4. Rules of Engagement (ROE).
     2.8.5. Link Architecture
     2.8.6. Equipment set-up and management (if using equipment different than unit has in-
     garrison).
     2.8.7. Callsign list of applicable units, aircraft, etc.
     2.8.8. Other information deemed necessary by the host unit.
2.9. Mission Planning Cell. The MPC is responsible for providing combat mission crews and
the battle staff with the most current mission execution information derived from multiple
agencies. They conduct mission-planning activities during operations where crew rotations
prevent adequate time for effective mission planning.
     2.9.1. When manning is available and daily shift rotations prevent the duty crew from
     conducting their own mission planning, the DO will ensure a mission planning cell is
     manned. The personnel manning the MPC should not be drawn from the operating crews but
     may be augmented by duty crews as required.
     2.9.2. MPC Manning. The MPC should contain personnel tailored to the particular mission
     being conducted. During operations using a full complement of duty crew, an MPC should
     include:

  Total    10                         Note: If necessary, personnel from the mission crew will
                                      augment the MPC as required. MPC can be tailored in
size/manning/grade to meet mission requirements.
       2.9.2.1. MPC manning can be adjusted by the type of mission being supported. For
       instance, in a primarily surveillance mission, the weapons personnel can be removed and
       tailored by the DO.
       2.9.2.2. The MPC Chief will be appointed by the DO. Typically the Chief will be a
       graduate of the USAFWS when available. When not available, the MPC Chief will be the
       senior officer assigned to the MPC.
       2.9.2.3. Members of the MPC must be Combat Mission Ready (CMR). Individuals
       designated medically as Duties Not to Include Controlling (DNIC) may perform MPC
       duties.
   2.9.3. MPC Duties and Responsibilities. See Attachment 6.

                                            Chapter 3

                                         OPERATIONS

3.1. General. This chapter contains roles and responsibilities for certain mission crew positions.
This information is in addition to AFI 11-214, Aircrew, Weapons Director, and Terminal Attack
Controller Procedures for Air Operations; AFTTP 3-1.26, Tactical Employment of the Theater
Air Control System (TACS); 13-1 MCS v.1 Modular Control System—Training; 13-1 CRC v.2,
Command and Control Systems Standardization/Evaluation Program—Modular Control System
Evaluation Criteria, and the current syllabus for the respective crew positions. Not all positions
will have additional information.
     3.1.1. FTUs will adhere to sections 3.2, 3.9, and 3.10 and paragraph 3.6.1 and 3.14.2.5.
3.2. Operations Management.
     3.2.1. The ACS/FTU/TS unit Commander (CC) and Director of Operations (DO) will be an
     Air Force/Air National Guard (ANG) field grade officer rank and will possess a 13B3D Air
     Force Specialty Code (AFSC). The CRC CC/DO will be designated to perform duties of the
     Battle Staff (BS). Each unit will also have an Operations Superintendent position and will be
     manned by a Chief Master Sergeant possessing a 1C500 AFSC. The TS/FTU Operations
     Superintendent position minimum grade requirement for the TS/FTU is Senior Master
     Sergeant possessing a 1C591 AFSC.
     3.2.2. The DO is responsible for ensuring operations personnel are trained, equipped, and
     available to execute the tasks associated with the unit’s mission. The DO will create, manage,
     and execute a daily schedule assigning duties to assigned personnel.
     3.2.3. During daily, in-garrison training operations, the DO will perform the duties of the
     BS, and will establish procedures for managing daily operations normally handled by the
     Unit Command Center (UCC).
3.3. CRC Mission. The operational mission of a CRC is to provide the Joint/Combined Forces
Air Component Commander (J/CFACC) with the means to direct and execute air operations. The
CRC provides the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) the primary interface for centralized
command of BMC2 agencies from all the services contributing to the air campaign plan. The
CRC may be responsible for:
     3.3.1. Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2). The CRC BMC2 mission is
     supported by the Modular Control System (MCS). The MCS is the equipment that provides
     the visual displays, communications connectivity, and the interoperability
     systems/components that enable CRC operators to make tactical decisions in the battlespace.
     3.3.1.1. Battle Management (BM). The Command and Control (C2) of air operations in a
     decentralized execution mode, by managing, disseminating, and assigning mission tasks
     defined in appropriate tasking orders. This also includes using ground and airborne sensors to
     provide surveillance coverage in an assigned area.
     3.3.2. Surveillance. Surveillance functions include detection, identification, classification,
     and tracking of airborne objects. CRC sensors (organic and netted), detect and provide
     cueing to engage hostile manned and unmanned aircraft as well as some cruise missiles.
AFI13-1CRCV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                   13


   Additional surveillance functions include electronic protection (EP) and the recognition and
   reporting of electronic attack (EA).
       3.3.2.1. Combat Identification (CID). The CRC has the capability to disseminate timely,
       accurate, and relevant identification information to allow engagement of hostile targets
       and avoid fratricide. In addition to organic system capabilities that support lack-of-
       friendly and presence-of-friendly characterization i.e., Identification, Friend, or
       Foe/Selective Identification Feature (IFF/SIF), other capabilities and information from
       other CID capable systems/assets will be used to provide the CRC a positive
       identification (PID) capability.
   3.3.3. Weapons Control. The CRC supports and/or coordinates offensive and defensive
   counter air (OCA/DCA), air interdiction (AI), air refueling (AR), close air support (CAS),
   combat search and rescue (CSAR), search and rescue, high value airborne asset protection
   (HVAA), suppression/destruction of enemy air defenses (S/DEAD), electronic warfare (EW),
   Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), special operations, and the direction of
   air defense artillery (ADA) systems in theater air defense (TAD).
   3.3.4. Combat Airspace Management. The CRC provides airspace management in the
   implementation of the Airspace Control Order (ACO). These tasks include pre/post-strike
   force marshalling and recovery (referred to functionally as Check-In/Out), en-route tactical
   flight following in expeditionary environments, control in support of ground forces (e.g.,
   Troops in Contact (TIC) support) and Continental United States (CONUS) air
   defense/homeland security support.
   3.3.5. Tactical Data Link (TDL) Management. The CRC consolidates organic and non-
   organic sensors into the common tactical picture (CTP) for distribution over TDLs. Under the
   direction of the AOC’s Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO), the CRC manages the theater
   TDL architecture within its assigned operational area. The CRC supports Link 11, Link 11B,
   Link 16, Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL), and North Atlantic Treaty Organization
   (NATO) Link 1. The CRC can act as data forwarder and transmit the CTP to theater C2
   nodes to include lateral, joint, and combined agencies in addition to the AOC.
3.4. Tailored Equipment Configuration. The CRC equipment is designed to be deployed in a
configuration that meets the mission tasking. This results in a flexible system package capable of
meeting a broad spectrum of operational mission profiles. The CRC uses scalable unit type codes
(UTCs) to support combatant commander mission requirements. UTCs are capability focused to
accomplish the assigned mission and consist of manpower and/or equipment. CRC UTCs can be
tailored based on the theater operational mission and provide an efficient means to deliver the
right amount of capability to the warfighter. The current CRC executes BMC2 capabilities
through employment of deployed UTCs. It executes Battlespace Awareness (BA) capabilities
through employment of Deployable Radar (DR) UTCs. Associated communications, vehicles,
and support equipment are resident with the UTCs. Detailed descriptions of the UTCs are
contained in the CRC Mission Capability (MISCAP) statements.
   3.4.1. The CRC is subordinate to the AOC and provides an organic communications
   capability in support of its functions. The CRC will deploy with up to four MCS Operations
   Modules (OMs), two AN/TPS-75 RADARS, Tri-Service Tactical Communications System
   (TRI-TAC) communications equipment, Theater Deployable Communications (TDC), JTIDS
   Module (JM) and supporting equipment. CRCs can extend RADAR coverage through the use
14                                                        AFI13-1CRCV3 21 JANUARY 2010


     of multiple sensors and remoting techniques, while the JMs will support data link
     transmission.
     3.4.2. An additional augmented capability for the CRC is the use of non-organic RADAR
     access (NORA) which allows the CRC to access non-AN/TPS-75 RADARS such as civilian
     air traffic control RADARs or other host nation tactical RADARs to further expand RADAR
     coverage areas. However, mission planning must be conducted since not all civil and other
     tactical RADARS may work using the NORA. Additional equipment such as AN/TRC-215,
     Remote Radio Secure Voice System (RRSVS) will be required to fully and successfully
     integrate non-organic RADARs and communications (for control of aircraft) for those
     sensors located Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) from the CRC.
3.5. Mission Crew Manning. A CRC mission crew is defined below. Positional descriptions
highlight the specific positional/crew duties and responsibilities. Unit commanders may tailor
crews to meet mission requirements. The Air Defense Artillery Fire Control Officer (ADAFCO)
is assigned to CRC once the Area Air Defense Commander or designated representative
validates the positions. Currently, three crews are required for a full CRC (all core UTCs
utilized). This is expected to increase to four crews in FY 2010. The three mission crews and
battle staff are comprised of, but not limited to, the following optimum manning by grade per
position:

   3.5.1. Not every configuration requires personnel from each duty section to operate the
   equipment. The SQ/CC or SQ/DO will determine the manning required to meet the desired
   capability.
   3.5.2. Minimum Manning In-Garrison Live-fly. This configuration describes the crew
   required to conduct live-fly operations with a minimal weapons and surveillance function.
   Crew will consist of:
       3.5.2.1. One Senior Director (SD)
          3.5.2.1.1. During routine training missions of no greater than 4v4, the SD may
          conduct red air or flight follow control.
          3.5.2.1.2. During routine flying operations, a WD with a Senior Weapons Director
          (SWD) certification may act as SD. (See Section 6.8.2.)
3.5.2.2. One WD per position required.
          3.5.2.2.1. During Large Force Exercises (LFEs), WDs may be assigned control
          functions such as Strike, AOR, or Check-in/Tank rather than sides of a fight.
          3.5.2.2.2. During standard training exercises, WDs may be assigned to control one
          half of a fight (blue air controller, red air controller).
          3.5.2.2.3. The SD will determine the minimum amount of WDs needed to conduct
          the mission.
       3.5.2.3. One ASO/AST.
          3.5.2.3.1. The ASO/AST will determine system initialization and surveillance
          requirements.
       3.5.2.4. One Data Systems Technician (DST).
       3.5.2.5. One Electronic Protection Technician (EPT) if utilizing the TPS-75.
       3.5.2.6. One Interface Control Technician (ICT).
   3.5.3. Other In-Garrison Minimum Crew Requirements. An MCC or DO will determine the
   crew minimums for Mission Training Exercises (MTE), and contingency operations as the
   mission demands, specified in local operating standards.
   3.5.4. Where less than a full crew is employed and no MCC is available, the senior ranking
   individual will be designated the Senior Ranking Officer (SRO) and will assume the duties of
   the MCC as far as mission planning and execution are concerned.
       3.5.4.1. The SRO will sign the 4145 in place of the MCC at the end of the appropriate
       duty shift.
       3.5.4.2. The SRO will not sign the 4145 as the DO unless normally authorized to do so
       as the designated DO.
3.6. Crew Rest. Parent/Deployed Operations Group Commander may waive all or any part of a
crew rest period. Crew members will enter crew rest a minimum of eight hours before show
time. Crew rest normally begins 1.5 hours after debrief. If any crewmember must perform duties
past the 1.5 hour period, crew rest does not begin until post-positional duties are completed.

     3.6.1. Minimum crew rest period is eight hours. This provides the crew a minimum of 8-
     hours of uninterrupted rest. If crew rest is interrupted so that an individual cannot get eight
     hours of uninterrupted rest, the individual must be afforded eight more hours of uninterrupted
     rest. Any interruption must be made only under the most exceptional circumstances.
3.7. Mission Crew Duty Sections. The operational duties of the Mission Crew are divided
among three broad sections.
     3.7.1. Battle Staff. Battle management is accomplished by the Battle Staff (BS), which
     consists of the following positions: CC, MCC, and BSC. The BS maintains maximum
     flexibility, responsiveness, and timeliness in the application of ACS resources. The BS
     reviews headquarters guidance and directives, monitors status, develops courses of action
     and implements the guidance as directed by the AOC. Chapter 4 details the duties and
     responsibilities of the Battle Staff positions.
     3.7.2. Weapons. The weapons section conducts the weapons control mission and combat
     airspace control functions under the supervision of the MCC. The weapons positions are the
     SD, WD, AWO, and Air Defense Artillery Fire Control Officer (ADAFCO) (when assigned).
     Chapter 5 details the duties and responsibilities of the weapons positions.
        3.7.2.1. Army Air Defense Artillery (ADA) asset employment will be coordinated and
        directed through the ADAFCO.
        3.7.2.2. Three ADAFCOs will be required once the CRC has been tasked with Region
        Air Defense Commander (RADC)/Sector Air Defense Commander (SADC) duties IAW
        theater directives. The ADAFCO(s) will be assigned to CRC and execute as part of the
        CRC mission crew. The ADAFCO(s) will be assigned a scope and necessary
        communications in order to execute the ADA mission. The ADAFCO coordinates with
        the SD.
     3.7.3. Surveillance. The surveillance section conducts the surveillance and data management
     operations and some airspace control and battle management functions while under the
     supervision of the MCC. The surveillance section is comprised of the ASO, AST, ICT, DST,
     EPT, and ST. Chapter 6 details the duties and responsibilities of the surveillance positions.
3.8. Common Mission Crew Responsibilities. Regardless of duty position section, the
Mission Crew members share some common duty responsibilities and tasks in addition to the
position-specific responsibilities outlined in the appropriate chapters of this instruction. These
include:
     3.8.1. Know the Commanders’ intent and J/CFACC mission statement.
     3.8.2. Attend crew briefing/debriefing and participate as required.
     3.8.3. Configure and operate the Operator Console Unit Workstation (OCUWS) and Voice
     Communications Access Sub-unit (VCAS) IAW the N-series checklists to meet mission
     requirements. If certified to use a system other than V5 (e.g., BC3), then configure and
     operate the console of that system IAW with applicable checklists and technical orders (TO).
     3.8.4. Read and interpret mission information on the OCUWS or other relevant scope/work
     stations.
AFI13-1CRCV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                   17


   3.8.5. Read and initial all items in the Operations Information File (OIF) read file prior to
   assuming the duty position for the assigned tour of duty.
   3.8.6. Use and control classified materials IAW established security procedures; employ
   information assurance (e.g., OPSEC) procedures as required by regulations. Authenticate
   voice transmissions as needed.
   3.8.7. Locate and report safety hazards in and around the OM, AN/TPS-75 van and other
   workspace areas. Use safety equipment as necessary and implement unit-level emergency
   procedures IAW checklists.
   3.8.8. Prepare and conduct a positional changeover briefing with the oncoming mission
   crewmember prior to departing position IAW the positional changeover briefing guide and
   unit checklists, if applicable.
   3.8.9. Obtain eight hours of crew rest between shifts. If combat/contingency operations
   prohibit proper crew rest, the Squadron CC/DO develops a plan to ensure crew members are
   capable of safely operating in their crew positions.
   3.8.10. Review Operations Plan (OPLAN), ATO, ACO, Operational Tasking (OPTASK)
   LINK, Special Instructions (SPINS), ROE, Tactical Operations Data (TACOPDAT), Theater
   Missile Defense (TMD) Plan, lessons learned, aeronautical charts and other mission-specific
   documents. Be familiar with coordinate systems to be employed, geographical references
   (GEOREFS) and conduct area familiarization in the unit’s operating location.
3.9. Local Operating Procedures (LOP). Each unit will create squadron operating standards
which will further define local procedures for operating in the in-garrison, training environment.
Theater or contingency SPINS will define operating procedures for use in the theater or
contingency environment. In the absence of instructions for the CRC contained in the SPINS, the
deployed unit will develop operating standards for use in the theater or contingency environment.
   3.9.1. The DO will sign the LOP and will file it in the Operational Information File.
   3.9.2. The DO will ensure that the LOP is reviewed every 18 months.
       3.9.2.1. The DO will sign a memorandum for record (MFR) which certifies the LOP for
       the next 18 month period. Only one MFR may be used to extend the period for the LOP.
       3.9.2.2. Interim changes may be made to the LOP which do not cause the LOP to expire.
       Interim Changes (ICs) will be integrated into the LOP at the next 18 month review
       period. No MFR may be used to extend an LOP with ICs attached.
   3.9.3. Individual templates for weapons and surveillance specialized briefs should be
   included in the LOP.
3.10. Voice Tape Recording. Tape recording live missions is essential to provide necessary
information concerning aircraft accidents, aircraft emergencies, and/or any event resulting in a
subsequent investigation. Tape recording also provides a valuable asset in determining lessons
learned for the development of TTPs.
   3.10.1. General. Various types of tape recorders are available to the CRC to satisfy tape
   recording requirements. Primary recorders used by the CRC are the recorder/reproducer
   (R/R) equipment in the OM and individual cassette tape voice recorders.
18                                                          AFI13-1CRCV3 21 JANUARY 2010


     3.10.2. Priorities for Recording Assignments.
        3.10.2.1. The MCC determines which positions are to be recorded; however, the MCC
        may delegate this task (e.g., to the SD). The priority of recording transmissions is mission
        dependent. Prioritization will include at a minimum the primary control guard and
        primary aircraft control channel. Standard prioritizations are listed in Attachment 8.
     3.10.3. Operating Responsibilities and Procedures.
        3.10.3.1. All missions involving the control of live aircraft will be recorded. If there is no
        R/R or other recording capability available, annotate the fact in the operations logbook,
        and notify the MCC or DO.
        3.10.3.2. The DST prepares the recorder and manages the loading, unloading, storage,
        and labeling of tapes. The MCC/SRO will ensure that the tape is started prior to the
        assumption of daily duties or ops normal call.
            3.10.3.2.1. At the FTU, Current Operations manages the storage and labeling of
            tapes. Loading and unloading is the responsibility of equipment checkout personnel
            and Instructor WD respectively. The MCC (or Weapons Instructor at the FTU) will
            ensure that the tape is started prior to the assumption of daily duties or ops normal
            call.
        3.10.3.3. Change recording tapes at the end of the mission crew shift change.
        3.10.3.4. Perform checks of the recorder at mission crew shift change to ensure full
        operation.
        3.10.3.5. Ensure the following is annotated in the operations logbook at the beginning of
        each duty shift:
            3.10.3.5.1. Tape number.
            3.10.3.5.2. Start number point, if applicable (for voice cassette recorder).
            3.10.3.5.3. Date and ZULU time.
            3.10.3.5.4. Name of individual changing tape (when applicable).
        3.10.3.6. Mark each complete tape with the following:
            3.10.3.6.1. Tape number.
            3.10.3.6.2. Date and time of tape stop.
        3.10.3.7. Ensure tapes are marked, handled, and stored IAW DoD Directive 5200.1R,
        Information Security and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management.
        3.10.3.8. Notify the ASO of recording malfunctions. At the FTU notify Current
        Operations.
     3.10.4. Tape Retention. Retain recording tapes for 48 hours for in-garrison training and 30
     days during combat/contingency operations. Recording tapes containing information
     concerning an aircraft accident/incident will be identified, marked, and retained separately
     out of normal rotation usage until the incident is resolved or for a minimum of six months.
     The MCC or higher authority may direct a tape or tapes be retained for a specific reason. In
AFI13-1CRCV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                   19


   such a case, mark the tape appropriately with the requester’s name, rank, duty title,
   organization, and disposition instructions and retain out of normal rotation usage.
3.11. Video Recording. The MCE lacks an organic video recording capability. To the
maximum extent possible, weapons will use video recording for use in debrief.
   3.11.1. The designated AWO/WD prepares the video recorder and manages the loading,
   unloading, storage, and labeling of tapes. The SD will ensure that the tape is started prior to
   the assumption of control or ―FIGHTS ON‖ call.
   3.11.2. Ensure the following is annotated in the operations logbook at the beginning of each
   duty shift:
       3.11.2.1. Tape number.
       3.11.2.2. Date and ZULU time.
       3.11.2.3. Name of individual responsible for tape (when applicable).
   3.11.3. Mark each complete tape with the following:
       3.11.3.1. Tape number
       3.11.3.2. Ensure tapes are marked, handled, and stored IAW DoD Directive 5200.1R,
       AFI 31-401. Video tapes are to be considered at least SECRET.
   3.11.4. The SD or instructor will schedule a time to review the tape and extract lessons
   learned with the controller.
   3.11.5. Units will develop local procedures for managing tapes and recording missions and
   publish in their LOP. As a minimum, video tape retention will be IAW with para 3.10.4.
3.12. Degraded Sensor Procedures. The CRC is a highly flexible system with many individual
sensor components providing separate, supporting capabilities to the overall system. Individual
components may fail during operations, leaving other components intact and providing limited
overall capabilities. Refer to Attachment 7 for tactical data reporting of degraded operations.
   3.12.1. Operating with limited radar capabilities. Not every function of the CRC will require
   the use of active radar or IFF/SIF interrogation. A loss of organic primary or secondary radar
   can come about either by design (tailored configuration) or by equipment outage.
       3.12.1.1. The MCC must report loss of primary/secondary radar to HHQ (AOC) or unit
       BS through reporting channels whenever such outage occurs as the result of mechanical
       failure. It is the judgment of the MCC or SD on duty to determine whether live-flight
       activity can continue with degraded sensors or whether the CRC must terminate activities
       until radar functions are restored. When subordinate to an AOC or similar HHQ structure,
       the MCC will make a recommendation to the AOC based on his or her sound judgment
       before ceasing operations. The MCC will inform the CC of subsequent decisions/actions
       taken.
       3.12.1.2. When the CRC is conducting weapons control operations, the SD will advise
       the MCC of the impact of primary or secondary sensor loss to the safety of flight,
       weighing the risk factor of the mission involved against the benefits of continued
       operation in degraded conditions.
20                                                         AFI13-1CRCV3 21 JANUARY 2010


     3.12.2. Operating with no radar capabilities. If neither the primary nor secondary radar is
     functioning, the MCC and SD will determine whether advisory control is possible. Advise
     affected agencies of the loss of radar capability.
3.13. Unit Command Center (UCC).
     3.13.1. Battle Staff Workspace. Under most circumstances, the CC/DO will be located with
     and conduct battle management from the UCC with the BSC and the unit supporting staff.
        3.13.1.1. The UCC is established by the commander to facilitate centralized unit C2. The
        UCC will be equipped with an array of tactical displays and communication assets to
        allow the commander and battle staff to facilitate planning, directing, coordinating, and
        controlling CRC operational and support activities.
        3.13.1.2. It is the unit CC’s responsibility to establish staff and operate the UCC. The
        UCC provides the CC a centralized point for unity of effort and efficient day-to-day unit
        coordination.
        3.13.1.3. As a minimum, the UCC will be staffed with the CC/DO/BSC and the
        following sections: System Control (SYSCON), Maintenance Operations Center (MOC),
        Site Support, Force Protection (FP), Readiness, and the Intelligence section. Additionally,
        the UCC will host those functions that ensure the security and functioning of the CRC
        site and personnel, serving as the central point for operations and maintenance
        information flow. Specific BMC2 CC/BSC roles and responsibilities will be discussed
        separately in Chapter 4.
            3.13.1.3.1. When authority is delegated by the CRC commander, the BSC serves as
            the executive agent for the commander for combat support activities. The CC/BSC
            directs the combat support function to ensure mission requirements are met through
            directing and coordinating as appropriate with internal sections and external agencies.
            The CC/BSC must facilitate planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling support
            activities of the unit’s subordinate mission support sections. The CC must provide
            designated authorities both laterally and vertically with essential information to
            permit effective decision-making. The CC/BSC must have thorough knowledge of the
            tasked mission, mission support equipment/systems, and personnel. These duties
            apply to the deployment, employment, and redeployment phases of any operation.
        3.13.1.4. The CC/DO and BSC as a minimum are responsible for the following:
            3.13.1.4.1. The general health and welfare of unit personnel.

     of battle management data via data link message sets and commands. The CRC digital
     interface systems contribute to the COP maintained at the AOC (if applicable) and
     supported by other data link participants. The data link operations section is normally
     supervised by the AST and manned by the DST and ICT. The DST and ICT will inspect
     the data link equipment and will establish links with participants. The ASO/AST will
     brief the link status to the BS of any links and request maintenance support as required to
     make the links operational.
     3.14.2.4. Communications Checkout. Once released by the ASO/AST, any crew member
     assigned a communications function during mission planning will conduct functional
     checks on the assigned radio and frequency (―radio checks‖). Radio checks are preferably
     done with an external agency but internal checks are acceptable. Report unusable
     radios/frequencies to the ASO/AST who will forward reports as appropriate.

                   BATTLE STAFF DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

4.1. Battle Staff Overview. Overall Battle Management (BM) is the responsibility of the Battle
Staff (BS) under the direction of the commander. The BS is ultimately responsible for execution
of the ATO/ACO under the TACON of the Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) through the
Chief of Combat Operations (CCO). Supervision of the Mission Crew under the direction of the
Commander is normally delegated to the MCC. This paragraph does not apply to FTUs.
4.2. Battle Management (BM) Responsibilities. BM is the allocation or reallocation of
assigned assets for operations against the enemy (direct or supporting). BM is accomplished
through the coordination and integration of the weapons and surveillance sections. The AOC
assigns areas for each BMC2 agency with the ability to perform battle management functions.
For each BMC2 agency’s assigned area, the BMC2 agency (i.e., AWACS or CRC) provides
control, management, and identification/classification of all airborne tracks, defense of friendly
assets, and prosecution with assigned weapons of designated targets entering the assigned area,
and connectivity with other BMC2 elements. The assigned areas are known as the Battle
Management Areas (BMA). The BS and mission crew should expect to be delegated the
authority to operate in a decentralized execution mode. This authority may come at any point
during mission operations and therefore must be a critical planning objective.
   4.2.1. Battle Staff. The BS consists of the following positions: CC, normally the unit
   commander and/or the unit DO and the MCC and Battle Staff Coordinator (BSC). The MCC
   and BSC are Combat Mission Ready (CMR) duty positions. The BS in performing its BM
   roles and responsibilities will:
       4.2.1.1. Maintain maximum flexibility, responsiveness, and timeliness in the application
       of assigned resources.
       4.2.1.2. Receive and understand the Joint/Combined              Force    Air   Component
       Commander’s (J/CFACC) guidance and intent.
       4.2.1.3. Ensures that the JFACCs plan for CRC operations is executable.
       4.2.1.4. Review AOC guidance and directives, monitor status, develop courses of action
       and implement guidance as directed by the AOC.
       4.2.1.5. Review the mission objective and equipment status and provide directions for
       execution to all operations/support sections.
       4.2.1.6. Review the risk management for all phases of the operations.
           4.2.1.6.1. Conduct and execute risk assessment and recommend to the TACON
           authority acceptable levels of risk which affect CRC execution of the mission.
       4.2.1.7. Ensure situational awareness between the BS and mission crew for all tactical
       action decisions arising from external agencies.
       4.2.1.8. Prepare and brief a logical and responsive change of command and/or succession
       of duties for any position or personnel that may be lost for any reason.

4.3. Commander (CC), (AFSC 13B3D) (Maj – Lt Col on G-series orders. ) The unit CC
must ensure facilitation, planning, direction, coordination, and control of support activities of the
unit’s subordinate mission support sections. During tactical execution, the CRC is operationally
subordinate to the AOC Chief of Combat Operations, and the CRC commander is responsible for
implementing BMC2. The authority to execute operational control of weapons system (to
include friendly fighters and surface-to-air missiles [SAMs] and air defense artillery [ADA]
units) may be decentralized to the CRC Commander by the AOC, who in-turn may delegate
decentralized execution to the MCC. The CC is responsible for the management and direction of
tactical level BMC2 to include air defense and airspace control activities within the assigned
area.
     4.3.1. The unit CC will work from the Unit Command Center (UCC) with the BSC,
     providing the necessary information required to direct CRC activities. The BSC will
     coordinate with the CRC mission crew to obtain the required information and pass CC
     decisions, as required.
     4.3.2. The unit CC and DO will be Air Force/Air National Guard (ANG) field grade officers
     having, or in the process of obtaining, the 13B3D Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). This
     requirement is non-waiverable. Those not possessing the AFSC must be scheduled to attend
     the ABM course at Tyndall AFB, FL prior to performing CC or DO duties. The CRC CC and
     DO will perform the Battle Staff duties. CRC CCs and DOs will be required to qualify as
     MCCs in the MCE and meet the training and positional requirements outlined in AFI 13-1
     CRC Vol 1 for the MCC crew position. ACC/A3Y has waiver authority for CC and DO
     MCC qualifications. No additional commanders are authorized; there need not be a
     dedicated Flight Commander specific to each operational crew.
     4.3.3. The CC is responsible for:

                                           WEAPONS

5.1. Weapons Overview. The Weapons section conducts the weapons control function and,
under the supervision of the MCC, some TDL management, combat airspace control and battle
management functions. The Senior Director (SD) leads Weapons and directs their activities. The
SD supervises the Air Weapons Officers (AWO) and Weapons Directors (WD) who perform the
weapons control and battle management functional duties. When assigned, an Air Defense
Artillery Fire Control Officer (ADAFCO) is considered part of the Weapons section.
     5.1.1. The weapons section at the FTUs will be incorporated in locally established
     procedures and use this section as reference for daily operations and training in congruence
     with the rest of the document.
5.2. Weapons Control Responsibilities. Weapons control is the control of offensive and
defensive counter air (OCA/DCA), air refueling (AR) missions, dynamic targeting (DT),
coordination of, combat search and rescue (CSAR) operations, reconnaissance, airlift, electronic
attack (EA), special operations, emergency aircraft assistance, and direction of ADA Systems.
The weapons section is responsible for managing and employing the assigned weapons systems
IAW governing OPORD, ATO/ACO, SPINS and/or other theater directives. It requires a
thorough knowledge of friendly and enemy system capabilities and an understanding of doctrine
for the correct and proper application of force at the decisive time and place.
     5.2.1. The Weapons section must become subject matter experts in the areas of ROE, theater
     SPINS, area familiarization, and be intimately familiar with the documents listed in
     Appendix 6, Section A.6.2.
     5.2.2. Weapons control also involves the control of non-kinetic applications of force, such as
     electronic warfare (EW), tactical reconnaissance (tac recce), show of force (SOF) and show
     of presence (SOP), etc.
5.3. Tactical Data Link (TDL) Management. Data link management is the digital display and
transfer of battle management data and commands. It includes operation of the MCE computer,
communications systems, and MCE supporting databases. In the Weapons section, it involves
the use of data link messages to provide surveillance, targeting, and C2 orders through the digital
interface to provide maximum situational awareness with a limited amount of verbal
communication. Weapons operators should be proficient in the use of weapons specific link
control functions.
5.4. Combat Airspace Management Responsibilities. Airspace management is the
implementation of the ACO while providing safe passage advisories to airborne assets within the
AOR. The Weapons section must be familiar with ACO elements to include tanker anchors,
transit boulevards, air routes, and other ACM to safely and efficiently route aircraft through the
AOR in route to their designated working areas. These ACMs may require to be created
dynamically with the use of Restricted Operating Zones (ROZ), High Density Air Control Zones
(HIDACZ), Missile Engagement Zones (MEZ), and so on, and requires a flexibility and attention
to detail to manage.

                  SURVEILLANCE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

6.1. Surveillance Overview. The Surveillance section conducts the surveillance and the tactical
data link (TDL) management operations and, under the supervision of the MCC, some airspace
control and battle management functions. The ASO leads the surveillance section and directs
their activities. Surveillance section at the FTUs will be incorporated in locally established
procedures and use this section as reference for daily operations and training.
   6.1.1. As the section most intimately involved with the employment and use of the
   equipment, the ASO is responsible to the MCC for the reporting and tracking of equipment
   status and coordinating with the BSC during outages or interruptions.
   6.1.2. Several duty positions involved with the operation and employment of CRC
   equipment are assigned to the Surveillance section: AST, DST, ICT, EPT, and the ST.
6.2. Surveillance Responsibilities. The Surveillance section performs the surveillance
function: the detection, tracking, identification, and reporting of airborne entities within the
CRC’s assigned operational area, region or sector. Tracking, ID and reporting procedures are
determined by the J/CFACC for the theater and outlined in the appropriate theater
OPLAN/OPORD.
   6.2.1. The ASO will divide the CRC operational area into sub-areas and assign an ST to
   conduct surveillance within that airspace.
   6.2.2. Tracks not easily identifiable by the published SPINS and ID plan are referred to the
   MCC by the ASO for action by HHQ, typically the AOC.
6.3. Tactical Data Link (TDL) Management. The data link management is the digital display
and transfer of battle management data and commands. It includes operation of the Modular
Control Equipment (MCE) computer, communications systems, and MCE supporting databases.
Data link management also consolidates sensor inputs into a recognizable air picture for
distribution over TDL and forwards that picture to the AOC and/or adjacent C2 agencies. The
data link management function can be divided into two main responsibilities:
   6.3.1. Database Management. Database management is the loading, editing, and display of
   operations-area relevant points, tracks, and geometry corresponding to active Airspace
   Control Measures (ACM) IAW the published ACO. Database management is primarily
   performed by the DST. Additionally, the DST will act as the first contact for reporting and
   troubleshooting of any equipment failures, including radios, Operator Console Unit Work
   Stations (OCUWS), and the Recorder Unit (RU).
   6.3.2. TDL Management is the reception (from organic AN/TPS-75 detection and additional
   external sensors), processing, and forwarding of the CRC recognizable air picture (RAP) to
   the AOC and other BMC2 nodes to include lateral joint agencies. TDL Management is
   primarily performed by the ICT under the supervision of the ASO and in conjunction with
   the DST as required.
6.4. Electronic Protection Technician (EPT). The EPT is responsible for implementing
appropriate EP actions through the use of the AN/TPS-75 RADAR system displays and switch
46                                                          AFI13-1CRCV3 21 JANUARY 2010


actions to ensure optimal performance of the RADAR(s). The EPT section develops the EMCON
plan during mission planning and recommends changes as appropriate.
6.5. Combat Airspace Management Responsibilities. Airspace management is the
implementation of the ACO while providing safe passage advisories to airborne assets. The
Surveillance section ensures active ACMs are properly displayed and coordinates the activation
and deactivation of ACMs with the SD and MCC. The Surveillance section must be aware of
ACMs involved in the identification process such as known enemy airspaces (point of origin
[POO] criteria), minimum risk routes (MRR), safe passage routes, etc.
6.6. Battle Management (BM) Responsibilities. Battle management is the allocation or
reallocation of assigned assets for operations against the enemy (direct or supporting).
Surveillance must be aware of basic BM information to include friendly air routes, identification
of friendly airbases, basic capabilities and limitations of aircraft to provide elements of the
identification plan (to include ISR assets such as Rivet Joint).
6.7. Air Surveillance Officer (ASO) AFSC 13B3D (1Lt - Major). The ASO is responsible to
the MCC for surveillance, airspace, and data link functions. The ASO coordinates with the SD to
ensure RAP accuracy and distribution over the TDL network.
     6.7.1. The ASO will perform duties from the OM.
     6.7.2. The ASO may delegate authority for supervision of the surveillance section to the
     AST.
     6.7.3. The ASO will:
        6.7.3.1. Review all applicable mission-specific documents.
        6.7.3.2. Ensure that the surveillance section is briefed on the current mission, and is

     Daily Activity Log. The form is required to be completed and signed at the completion of
     each operations crew shift and forwarded to the DO for approval and signature. The daily
     activity log provides a complete summary of all crew operations for a particular shift and is
     an important tool for data correlation and analysis.
     8.3.2. AF Form 4146, Mission Briefing Guide. Use the Mission Briefing Guide to brief
     missions, record mission results, and serve as a record of unit control activities. WDs/AWOs
     use the form for all control activities conducted and forwarded to the MCC or crew leader for
     review and attachment to AF Form 4145.
8.4. Operations Checklists and Crew Aids. Operations checklists are lists of actions that
require mandatory, sequential compliance.
     8.4.1. Three categories of check lists: Normal Checklists (N), Emergency Checklists (E), and
     Quick Reaction Checklists (Q).
        8.4.1.1. Normal Checklists (N) are used for equipment power up/down and normal
        operations and employment.
        8.4.1.2. Emergency Checklists (E) are used for events that immediately threaten
        personnel, equipment, or aircraft with death, injury or destruction. Emergency checklists
        are denoted by a banded border.
        8.4.1.3. Quick Reaction Checklists (Q) are used for situations that require prompt
        response, but which do not constitute emergency situations.
     8.4.2. Crew Aids are a standard set of documents to facilitate mission execution. Crew aids
     are black on white background and contain charts, diagrams, lists, indexes, guides and other
     unclassified reference information deemed useful, but strict compliance is not required. Crew
     aids are issued for specific duty positions (e.g., WD, MCC, DST) and are organized by
     distribution groups. The groups are; I-Indexes, X-Emergency Guides, D-Directories, P-
AFI13-1CRCV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                                 65


  Planning Guides, G-General Guides, M-Mission Guides, J-Joint Operations, W-Weapons, S-
  Surveillance.
     8.4.2.1. The crew aids can be distributed in any manner deemed appropriate by the DO.
     They can be made available on position or each crewmember may be provided an
     individual copy.
     8.4.2.2. All checklists and crew aids are distributed over the HQ ACC/A3YG website, on
     the AF Portal. The checklists and crew aids are designed to be incorporated into standard
     4"x 7" flight crew checklist plastic binders.
     8.4.2.3. Operations checklists will be available to each operations crewmember before
     declaring the CRC operational or limited operational during peacetime operations.
     During wartime operations, the CRC will not delay activation of operations to satisfy this
     requirement; however, checklists and crew aids should be available for operator use as
     soon as possible after declaring the CRC operational or limited operational.
     8.4.2.4. HQ ACC/A3YG will be responsible for maintaining the checklists and crew aids
     on HQ ACC/A3YG website, on the AF Portal and will provide the instructions for their
     use IAW this directive.
     8.4.2.5. Recommended changes to checklists and crew aids will be made using AF Form
     847 and submitted through appropriate channels. ACC/A3YG will review, incorporate
     approved changes and post on HQ ACC/A3YG website, on the AF Portal. ACC/A3YG
     will notify the units of specific changes via separate memorandum/message.
     8.4.2.6. It will be the individual operations crewmember’s responsibility to ensure they
     have and use the current checklists and crew aids. The DO can authorize the creation of
     checklist and crew aid supplements, to include local procedures, as needed. The
     supplements will be IAW the existing format.
  8.4.3. Administrative Requirements. Prepare and maintain operations checklists IAW the
  following administrative guidelines:
     8.4.3.1. Checklists and crew aids should be incorporated into standard 4"x 7" flight crew
     checklist binders for use in the OM.
     8.4.3.2. Each unit will develop internal review procedures to ensure current checklists
     are in use. The review will be verified in writing. All checklists will be reviewed
     annually.
        8.4.3.2.1. The first page of each checklist and crew aid binder will contain the date of
        the last review and the initials of the reviewer. The reviewer’s initials signify the
        checklists and crew aids are current. All checklists and crew aids will be marked
        IAW DoD Directive 5200.1-R.
     8.4.3.3. The checklist titled, ―Controlling A/C Emergency‖, banded in black will be the
     first checklist in any binder.
     8.4.3.4. Checklists and crew aids will be in the front of the binder and separated from
     other material, if combined with other operational guides or documents, such as locally
     developed handbooks.

        8.4.3.5. Personnel manning an operations position must have in their possession the
        checklists as indicated by the checklist matrix listed in Attachment 9.
8.5. COMSEC Requirements. The MCC, through individual sections, ensures required
COMSEC materials (Voice Callsign List, codes and authenticators) are available to operations
crews. COMSEC material not maintained in the OIF will be signed out from the unit COMSEC
custodian. Issue, protection, and disposition of COMSEC material will be IAW DoD Directive
5200.1R, AFI 31-401, and Air Force Cryptographic Operational General (AFKAG)-1.
     8.5.1. This function will be performed by Current Operations at FTUs.
8.6. Operations Information File (OIF). The OIF is required to ensure that information
essential to the conduct of operations or emergency conditions are available. The read file
portion of the OIF centralizes significant, time sensitive issues and procedures that are
disseminated to operations personnel. Procedures for maintenance of the OIF are contained in
applicable MAJCOM directives. The MCC (or DO/ADO at FTUs) is responsible to ensure all
crew members read and initial items contained in the read file.
8.7. Operations Logbook.
     8.7.1. The Operations logbook is the official record of events that occurred during any live
     operation, exercise (live or simulated). The purpose is to maintain an accurate and detailed
     record of all significant events pertaining to operations occurring during each crew shift. Of
     primary importance are events that may result in subsequent investigations. The DO will
     ensure the Operations Logbook is properly maintained. The following procedures apply for
     all logbooks:
        8.7.1.1. Maintain the logbook in a permanently bound book such as a ledger or a journal.
        8.7.1.2. Classify the logbook SECRET since it contains information concerning actual or
        exercise alert warnings and states of preparedness, system capabilities, and other
        classified data. The logbook will be marked, handled, and stored IAW DoD Directive
        5200.1R, Information Security Program Regulation, AFI 31-401, Information Security
        Program Management.
        8.7.1.3. Make entries in the logbook in black or blue ink. Do not erase entries made in
        the logbook. Correct errors in entries by lining through the entry, placing individual’s
        initials at the end of the entry, and re-entering correct information on the next line.
        8.7.1.4. Open the logbook at 0001Z or at the beginning of the duty day and close it at
        2400Z or the end of the duty day. Use ZULU time for all entries.
        8.7.1.5. If a change in ZULU day occurs during the tour of duty, close the logbook and
        reopen it at that time.
        8.7.1.6. When opening and closing the logbook for the ZULU day or changing crews,
        include the operational crew identifier in the sign-on/off duty line.
        8.7.1.7. It is not necessary to record information that has already been noted in another
        authorized document or has been recorded unless it is deemed appropriate for clarity and
        understanding.
        8.7.1.8. The following entries are required, but not limited to:
AFI13-1CRCV3 21 JANUARY 2010                                                              67


       8.7.1.8.1. Time of each entry (using ZULU time).
       8.7.1.8.2. The MCC or DO Designee available will sign at the beginning and end of
       the tour of duty (indicating the time on/off duty with a legible rank and signature)
       certifying all entries are accurate and reflect a complete record of the tour of duty.
       8.7.1.8.3. Callsign of unit(s) to which information is received or sent.
       8.7.1.8.4. Initials of both individuals passing and receiving information.
       8.7.1.8.5. Verbal orders or instructions that deviated from standard operating
       procedures, to include any authentication used and if a reply was appropriate.
       8.7.1.8.6. R/R tape data.

      COORDINATION/EXECUTION BRIEFING GUIDE (MCC)—(DISCUSS ONLY
                         APPLICABLE ITEMS)

A4.1. PURPOSE: This is a business meeting where the open flow of information among all
crewmembers is encouraged. All available information should be included during this stage of
planning. It is understood that some important planning information may not be available until
very late in the day. MCCs will develop a plan to brief the entire crew at the
coordination/execution briefing. Emphasis is on the mission being planned, not slide production.
Note 1: The briefing will be conducted by the MCC. If an MCC is unavailable or not
participating in the mission the Senior Director will brief applicable areas. Those areas entitled
with a specific crew position will be briefed by that crew position. Other area headers with a
specific crew position identified (in parenthesis) will be briefed by the crew position so stated.

Note 2: The following guidelines are not comprehensive. MCCs should use judgment to
determine applicable areas for complete mission planning. Not all areas need be covered in
detail for every mission. Units should generate local mission planning checklists based on the
following guidelines for use in daily operations; areas covered by local operating standards (such
as in-garrison airspaces) may be briefed as ―standard‖.)
