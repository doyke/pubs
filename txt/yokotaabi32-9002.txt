the Installation Commander.
2. Guiding Publication. Within certain constraints, but as near as possible, the FB allocates
facility space in accordance with AFMAN 32-1084, Facility Requirements.

3. Recommendations for Utilization of Facilities. The 374th Facilities Board Working Group
(FBWG) makes recommendations to the FB for utilization of space within facilities. Group
Deputy Commanders comprise the membership of the FBWG.
4. Assignment of Facilities. The FB assigns all exclusive use and common space to
organizations. Common space is divided proportionately between multiple users when facilities
are assigned to more than one organization. The preponderant user is assigned the greater share
of common use space and must provide a Facility Manager
     4.1. Organizations will submit a space request using form YOKOTA AB Form 5. If space is
     required due to a new mission or a change in current mission requirements, see item 5.2.
     Requests will contain the following information require:
        4.1.1. Inclusive dates for which a facility is required. When possible, give at least one
        year advance notice to allow ample time to plan and program the requirement.
        4.1.2. Type of space required: administrative, warehouse, operational, etc.
        4.1.3. Number of personnel who will occupy the space.

        4.4.3. Estimate minor costs for required alteration or maintenance. The 374 CES Work
        Order Planning Section (374 CES/CEOER) will evaluate and provide cost estimates for
        extensive alteration and maintenance requirments. The 374 CES Programming section
        (374 CES/CENPD) will project costs at the next FB meeting according to AFI 32-1021,
        Planning and Programming Military Construction (Milcon) Projects.
