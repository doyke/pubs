1.17. Calculating Property Losses.
     1.17.1. When a total loss is being replaced by a new asset.
        1.17.1.1. Divide Net Book Value (i.e. original cost - depreciation) by original cost to get
        the book value percentage.
        1.17.1.2. Multiply the resulting percentage times the lowest replacement cost.
        1.17.1.3. Subtract salvage value, if any. For example, presume an asset purchased for
        $1,000 has a current value of $800; the replacement cost is $1,200, with no salvage value.
        HQ AFSVA will calculate the estimated replacement value to be: $800 divided by
        $1,000 = .80 x $1,200 = $960. The insurance payment is $960.
     1.17.2. When an asset is to be repaired, submit the two lowest repair estimates available. If
     only one estimate is available, contact HQ AFSVA/SVXHI for approval.
1.18. Depreciation. Depreciation for claims involving depreciable property is determined as
described in AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for Nonappropriated Funds Financial Management
and Accounting.
1.19. Minimum Property Claim Payable. When the loss is $500 or more, the AFIF pays the
value of the asset. Losses less than $500 are paid by the FSS as shown in Attachment 4.
1.20. Special Situations. The AFIF pays after all other insurance has paid. It pays all
reasonable expenses to reduce the property loss, excluding expenses related to personnel-related
expenses, administrative leave, or personnel evacuation expenses (see Attachment 2 for
exclusions).
1.21. Requesting Advance Payment. Excluding those losses listed in Attachment 2, other
catastrophic events may create a need for immediate funds for NAF insured asset replacement.
If such a need exists, the FSS Commander may submit a written request to HQ AFSVA/SVX for
an advance payment of NAF Funds, based on a NAF payable claim. As an alternative, the FSS
Commander may also request assistance from the MAJCOM successor NAFI, IAW AFI 34-201,
Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFs), Para 3.3.
     1.21.1. To get an advance payment, the RM provides reasonable evidence of a loss, and a
     request for advance payment which includes the following:
        1.21.1.1. A description of the occurrence resulting in the loss.
        1.21.1.2. A list of NAF-owned insured property damaged or destroyed with an estimate
        of their value or repair cost.
        1.21.1.3. A list of stolen/vandalized resale inventory supported by the physical inventory
        sheet with prices at cost.
        1.21.1.4. For loss of physical cash, (such as petty cash in a drawer), reasonable evidence
        of the amount of the loss.
AFI34-208 17 MAY 2011                                                                      9


1.22. Requests for advance payment and reasonable evidence of the loss. The AFIF will
make payment and deduct it from the final settlement. An estimate of the amount of an advance
payment payable from the AFIF is approximately 60-70 percent of the documented amount.
1.23. Assessments. All NAFIs pay assessments into the AFIF based on expected costs to cover
claims and administrative expenses.
1.24. Additional Insurance. If desired insurance requirements exceed the coverage or limits
the AFIF provides, the RM may send a written request through the MAJCOM to HQ
AFSVA/SVX for approval of additional coverage. Do not purchase commercial insurance for
the coverage unless approved by the MAJCOM and HQ AFSVA/SVX.

      AERO CLUB AIRCRAFT HULL AND LIABILITY INSURANCE PROGRAM

2.1. Purpose. This section details aircraft hull coverage with instructions and guidance for
paying claims and administering the self-insured Aero Club Aircraft Hull and Liability Insurance
Program. The Aero Club Aircraft Hull and Liability Insurance Program is administered through
HQ AFSVA/SVXHI.
2.2. Filing a Notice of Loss.
   2.2.1. The RM completes the electronic Hull Loss Notification from the Aero Club Hull
   Insurance Program section of the AF Services Benefits and Insurance website and e-mail it to
   HQ AFSVA/SVXHI
   2.2.2. The Chief, Aero Club Operations, files reports prescribed by AFI 34-217, Air Force
   Aero Club Program, and AFMAN 34-232, Aero Club Operations, Attachment 5. Upon
   receipt of the Mishap Report IAW AFMAN 34-232, Attachment 5, or electronic Notice of
   Loss, HQ AFSVA/SVXHI will send electronic confirmation with the claim number and
   declared value of aircraft to the RM to file the hull claim.
2.3. Filing a Proof of Loss. The RM sends the completed Proof of Loss with supporting
documents to HQ AFSVA/SVXHI within 90 days of receipt of the Notice of Loss.
   2.3.1. File the Proof of Loss to include the following information:
       2.3.1.1. Tail number and date and time of incident.
       2.3.1.2. Minimum two estimates of damage and pictures of damage (if available).
       2.3.1.3. Copy of any messages sent to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or other
       authorities.
2.4. Claim Extension. The RM may request an extension of claim filing by notifying HQ
AFSVA/SVXHI by e-mail, telephone, or fax. Provide claim number along with tail number,
incident date, installation, and number of days requested for extension of time.
2.5. Payment. HQ AFSVA/SVXHI pays the claim from the AFIF after receiving verification of
the loss and documentation reflecting the amount of the loss.
2.6. Authorized Signature on Proof of Loss. The RM sends a copy of the completed report of
investigation to HQ AFSVA/SVXHI through command channels. For losses of $25,000 or less,
the RM signs the Proof of Loss; when the loss exceeds $25,000, the FSS commander, director, or
deputy signs the document.
2.7. Deductible. There is a $250 deductible for repair costs to aero club aircraft. If the aircraft
is a total loss, there is no deductible. For example:
   2.7.1. If a covered aircraft, with a declared value of $45,000, is totally destroyed, the
   settlement is $45,000; no deductible is applied to a total loss.
   2.7.2. If a covered aircraft with a declared value of $45,000, has damage to a propeller
   valued at $1,000, the settlement will be $750 ($1,000 minus $250 = $750).
AFI34-208 17 MAY 2011                                                                        11


   2.7.3. The maximum deductible for any one occurrence is $1,000. This normally applies
   when multiple aircraft are on the ground and damaged during a strong wind, hail, hurricane
   or tornado.
2.8. Salvage. The aero club must arrange for salvage IAW AFI 34-204, Property Management,
and notify HQ AFSVA/SVPCR of the amount of the salvage.
   2.8.1. The installation provides HQ AFSVA/SVX and HQ AFSVA/SVPCR with minimum
   two salvage bids.
   2.8.2. HQ AFSVA/SVX makes the final decision on whether to salvage or repair aircraft.
2.9. Recovering Lost Property. If an aero club recovers property after it receives payment for
a loss covered by the AFIF, the RM will reimburse the AFIF to the extent of the recovery, but
not in excess of the payment received from the AFIF.
2.10. Insuring Aircraft Hulls.
   2.10.1. The AFIF insures aero club owned aircraft based on their declared value.
   2.10.2. The AFIF program insures leased aircraft only after HQ AFSVA/SVX has approved
   the lease in writing (see paragraph 2.12.4.).
2.11. Government Loaned Aircraft. An aircraft hull received at little or no cost is not insured.
On these hulls, the Aero Club may request AFIF coverage on Aero Club NAF capital
improvements that club has made.
   2.11.1. Examples of covered capital improvements are:
       2.11.1.1. Communications equipment.
       2.11.1.2. Engine additions or enhancements.
       2.11.1.3. Advanced or newly modernized equipment purchased and installed at the aero
       club’s expense.
       2.11.1.4. Major refurbishment to include painting, structural alterations, etc.
       2.11.1.5. Other NAF-owned equipment installed after the aircraft was received.
   2.11.2. HQ AFSVA/SVPCR will approve increases in asset value created by capital
   improvements when reported by the Aero Club.
2.12. When Aircraft Are Covered.
   2.12.1. The program covers aircraft reported on AF Form 270, Status of Aero Club Aircraft
   and Operations Report. See AFMAN 34-232, Attachment 6 for instructions on completing
   the AF Form 270.
   2.12.2. Newly acquired aircraft are covered on the day the club takes possession from the
   vendor, factory or previous owner. Provide electronic written notification to HQ
   AFSVA/SVXHI and HQ AFSVA/SVPCR upon receipt of aircraft, and add aircraft to
   subsequent AF Form 270. Coverage continues as long as the club reports the aircraft on AF
   Form 270.
   2.12.3. Government loaned aircraft are covered when the club takes physical possession of
   the aircraft.
 12                                                                   AFI34-208 17 MAY 2011


   2.12.4. Leased aircraft are covered upon written notice of approval of the lease agreement by
   HQ AFSVA/SVXHI. Information required includes: aircraft make, model, and year; FAA
   registration number; total number of seats; declared value; and date obtained.
2.13. Exclusions.
   2.13.1. The self-insured hull program does not cover damage from:
       2.13.1.1. Fair wear and tear.
       2.13.1.2. Freezing.
       2.13.1.3. Mechanical breakdown or failure, unless such loss or damage precipitates a
       forced landing that results in other physical damage to the airplane.
2.14. Other Conditions.
   2.14.1. This program pays all reasonable expenses incurred in an effort to prevent further
   loss or damage (with the exception of offering a reward for lost property).
   2.14.2. In the event of theft, robbery, burglary, or pilferage, the FSS commander, director, or
   deputy notifies proper authorities.
2.15. Paying Assessments (Hull). Aero clubs pay a quarterly assessment based upon
information provided on the AF Form 270. The declared value of the aircraft is used to calculate
hull insurance.
   2.15.1. Declared values may be adjusted between AF Form 270 cycles by providing HQ
   AFSVA/SVPCR a “real time” written update; e-mail preferred. Use “remarks” section of
   AF Form 270 to confirm dates/value of changes for specific aircraft.
2.16. Paying Assessments (Liability). Aero clubs pay a quarterly assessment based on the
AF Form 270. Assessments for aero club liability insurance are calculated based upon the
physical number of seats in each aircraft.
   2.16.1. When adding or removing seats, installations may exercise the following option,
   which only affects aero club liability insurance: the Aero Club must notify HQ
   AFSVA/SVPCR in writing; e-mail preferred. Use “remarks” section of AF Form 270 to
   confirm the dates that seat changes for specific aircraft occurred.
   2.16.2. An aero club may physically add or remove seats for a minimum of 30 days and the
   liability assessment rate will be adjusted to the appropriate number of seats (30 consecutive
   days can cross months, quarters, or fiscal year). Seat adjustments must be reported to
   HQ AFSVA/SVPCR in writing “real time” (e-mail preferred). Report date of seat change
   and number of seats information in the “remarks” section of the next AF Form 270.
   2.16.3. “Lay Up” is an aircraft grounded for maintenance or other reasons for at least 30
   consecutive days; the assessment is only for hull insurance, not liability (30 consecutive days
   can cross months, quarters, or fiscal year). Hull rate will only be assessed for the period of
   time the aircraft is in “lay up” status. The Chief, Aero Club Operations, must notify HQ
   AFSVA/SVPCR “real time” as soon as they determine aircraft will be grounded for at least
   30 consecutive days. They must also report this information in the “remarks” section of the
   next AF Form 270.
AFI34-208 17 MAY 2011                                                                          13


   2.16.4. When an aircraft that is in “lay up” status requires a ferry or maintenance flight, the
   assessment is only for hull insurance. Aircraft may remain in “lay up” status until returned to
   revenue service. The Chief, Aero Club Operations, must notify HQ AFSVA/SVPCR (e-mail
   preferred) prior to ferry or maintenance flight of grounded aircraft.
2.17. Determining the Declared Value. HQ AFSVA/SVPCR maintains a copy of the Aircraft
Bluebook Price Digest and will provide assistance in determining declared value of aero club
aircraft. Declared values are established when the club obtains the aircraft, and are updated by
the aero club manager not later than 31 December of each year thereafter, or whenever a capital
improvement is made that impacts the value of an aircraft.
   2.17.1. The declared value must not deviate more than 15 percent from the average price
   listed in the Aircraft Bluebook Price Digest.
   2.17.2. HQ AFSVA/SVPCR approves the declared value of all insured aircraft.                The
   declared value of leased aircraft must be the amount stated in the lease agreement.
2.18. Hull Loss Payments. HQ AFSVA/SVXHI makes payment after receiving the Proof of
Loss with supporting documentation.
2.19. Payment of Aero Club Liability Claims. See Chapter 3.
 14                                                                      AFI34-208 17 MAY 2011

   any action taken by installation officials.
3.4. Settling Liability Claims.
   3.4.1. Refer anyone wanting to file a liability claim against a NAFI to the servicing Staff
   Judge Advocate (SJA) office (see Attachment 4).
   3.4.2. The SJA or higher approving authority sends approved claims to AF/JAA-S, where
   they are reviewed by AF/JAA-S and paid by HQ AFSVA/SVXHI from the AFIF as
   appropriate.
3.5. Exclusions.
   3.5.1. Claims arising from any contract or contractor relationship.
AFI34-208 17 MAY 2011                                                                          15

3.6. Personnel Claims. The NAFI pays approved claims of less than $500 for loss or damage
to NAF employees while working in the scope of their employment without reimbursement from
the AFIF. For example, if an installation pays a Personnel Claim to an employee of $400, there
is no reimbursement from AFIF. If the reimbursement is $600, the AFIF reimburses the
installation $100 (see Attachment 4). Examples of personnel claims (damage to employee’s
property while at work) are: Clothing damaged at work; loss of personal equipment at work such
as glasses, coat, or other personal property.
3.7. Customer Complaints. The FSS activity manager, in conjunction with the RM, settles
customer complaints subject to the approval of the FSS commander, director, or deputy without
SJA involvement.
   3.7.1. Customer complaints are dissatisfactions arising out of NAFI supported operations
   that can be resolved by cash reimbursement, service, or replacement in kind.
   3.7.2. Examples of Customer Complaints are:

       3.7.3.1. Customers’ vehicle is damaged by faulty equipment in an FSS car wash.
       3.7.3.2. Damage occurred to a customer's vehicle while stored in an FSS storage area.
       3.7.3.3. A customer’s vehicle is damaged by an on-duty FSS employee while being
       worked on (such as getting an oil change or tire balancing) in an FSS auto hobby shop.
       3.7.3.4. Other claims for lost or damaged privately owned personal property in the
       custody of or being serviced by the NAFI.
3.8. AFIF Reimbursement. The AFIF reimburses NAFIs for that portion of any customer
complaint paid over $1,000. The activity manager or RM pays the claimant, sends a copy of the
voucher to HQ AFSVA/SVXHI. The AFIF reimburses the NAFI the amount of the payment
over $1,000.
3.9. Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). NAFIs are instrumentalities of the Federal
Government and enjoy its privileges and immunities. A tort committed by a NAF employee,
acting within the scope of his or her employment or duties, may give rise to NAF liability under
the FTCA. Do not use appropriated funds to pay an award, compromise, or judgment of a claim
for which a NAFI is liable.
 16                                                                     AFI34-208 17 MAY 2011


3.10. Customer Complaint Claims Settlement.
   3.10.1. Customer complaints may involve conduct which could give rise to tort-type claims;
   however, process them as customer complaints unless:
       3.10.1.1. They cannot be settled to the satisfaction of both parties.
       3.10.1.2. The requested settlement includes a demand for consequential damages such as
       for bodily injury or for property damage to other than the article involved.
   3.10.2. Consulting the SJA office does not change a Customer Complaint into a liability
   claim; however, the customer filing an SF 95 with the SJA office does.
       3.10.2.1. This action requires RM approval to process as a Customer Complaint.
   3.10.3. If the RM has requested the SJA review the claim and the SJA approved the claim, it
   must be sent to HQ AFSVA/SVXHI for payment as a customer complaint. In some cases,
   the AFIF will pay the claimant directly to save time.
3.11. Commercial Insurance. If a special liability risk arises, such as purchase of “rain-
out/cancellation” insurance, “hole-in-one” insurance for a golfing event, or other one-time
special events, the FSS commander, director, or deputy must contact HQ AFSVA/SVX, through
MAJCOM, in writing and request approval to purchase commercial insurance.
3.12. Broad Coverage. Because of the broad coverage of the NAF liability program, NAFIs
must not purchase commercial public liability insurance except when it is required by a Status-
of-Forces agreement or other country-to-country agreement.
3.13. Legal Representation for Individuals.
   3.13.1. Legal Representation. Legal representation may be authorized to defend tort actions
   brought against:
       3.13.1.1. NAFI employees.
       3.13.1.2. Aero Club contract flight instructors.
       3.13.1.3. Members.

       3.13.1.5. Customers.
       3.13.1.6. Authorized users of NAFI equipment.
3.14. Civilian Counsel. AF/JAA-S will recommend to AF/A1S whether or not legal fees for
civilian counsel should be paid from the AFIF.
   3.14.1. Legal Procedures. For legal representation, apply the following procedures:
       3.14.1.1. The claimant forwards a request for representation to the Headquarters, Air
       Force Legal Operations Agency, Claims and Tort Litigation Staff, (HQ AFLOA/JACC)
       with a copy to AF/JAA-S.
       3.14.1.2. HQ AFLOA/JACC provides a copy to AF/JAA-S who reviews the request and
       recommends to HQ USAF/A1S whether or not the AFIF should pay for the requested
       legal representation.
AFI34-208 17 MAY 2011                                                                           17


      3.14.1.3. If civilian counsel is retained and the case goes to a judgment, or a settlement is
      reached, AF/JAA-S will notify HQ AFLOA/JACC of the adverse judgment and the
      amount. If the lawsuit is in a foreign country, AF/JAA-S will notify the The Judge
      Advocate General’s International Law Division, HQ USAF/JAI.
      3.14.1.4. AF/JAA-S works with HQ AFLOA/JACC or HQ USAF/JAI, as appropriate, to
      determine whether or not the judgment or compromise should be paid by HQ AFSVA.
3.15. Paying Assessments to Support the Program. All AF NAFIs pay assessments into the
AFIF, except where specifically excluded. HQ AFSVA/SVX calculates assessments based on
the need to cover all claims and expenses.
3.16. Special Conditions.
   3.16.1. The NAF liability insurance program will not duplicate claims paid by any
   commercial insurance company.
   3.16.2. The FSS RM, deputy, commander or director should contact HQ AFSVA/SVX,
   through the MAJCOM, before arranging for or becoming involved in any venture where the
   risk of loss could substantially increase NAF liability exposure.
   3.16.3. Neither the US Government nor any of its instrumentalities may file a payable claim
   against a NAFI.
   3.16.4. Unless the FSS commander, director, deputy or higher authority grants approval, do
   not consider property of others left on the premises as in the care and custody of any NAFI.
