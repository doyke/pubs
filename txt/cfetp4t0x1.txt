PART I

Preface

1. This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and
training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support
resources, and core task requirements for this specialty. The CFETP will provide personnel a clear
career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training. To read, review, or
print a copy of the current CFETP, go to http://www.e-publishing.af.mil. NOTE: Civilians
occupying associated positions may use Part II to support duty position qualification training.

2. The CFETP consists of two parts. Both parts are used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control
training within the career field.

2.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. Section A
explains how everyone will use the plan. Section B identifies career field progression information,
duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path. Section C associates each skill
level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other). Section D indicates
resource constraints. Examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities. Section E identifies
transition training guide requirements for the ranks of SSgt through MSgt.

2.2. Part II provides training guidance for all skill levels. Section A identifies the Specialty Training
Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and
Training Command (AETC) conducted training, core tasks, and correspondence course requirements.
Section B contains course objective information supervisors will use to determine if an Airman has
satisfied training requirements. Section C identifies available support materials. An example is a
Qualification Training Package (QTP). There are no QTPs required at this time for the medical
laboratory specialty. Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine
resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses.
Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine
additional training required for the associated qualification needs. Training for Air Reserve
Component (ARC) personnel are identified in this section.

3. Using CFETP guidance ensures individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient
training at the appropriate career point. This plan enables us to train today's work force for
tomorrow's jobs. At the unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct
training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.

These tasks are only for those career fields that still need them applied to their schoolhouse tasks.



                                                   6
Section A - General Information

1. Purpose. This CFETP provides information necessary for the AFCFM, MFMs, commanders,
training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective
career field training program. This plan outlines the training that 4T0X1individuals should receive in
order to develop and progress throughout their career. This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade,
qualification, advanced, and proficiency training. Initial skills training is the AFS- specific training
an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of
the 3-skill level. Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at technical training centers.

1.1. Upgrade Training (UGT). Identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements,
and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 5-, 7- and 9-skill levels. QT is
actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.
This training program occurs both during and after the UGT process. It is designed to provide the
performance skills/knowledge required to do the job. Proficiency training is additional training,
either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or OJT, provided to personnel to increase
their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. The CFETP has several
purposes, some are:

1.1.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training
program. Also, it helps supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.

1.1.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and
recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.

1.1.3. Lists training courses available, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery
method.

1.1.4. Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field
training process.

2. Uses. The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and
cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.

2.1. AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable
training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.
They also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to
provide the identified training.

2.2. MFMs ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and
proficiency requirements. Identified requirements are satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract
training, or exportable courses. MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be
identified for inclusion into this CFETP.

2.3. Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. The
list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.

3. Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority. Also, the AFCFM will
initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM
                                                    7
representatives and AETC training personnel identify and coordinate career field training
requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.

important roles in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission. It is essential that everyone
involved in training do his or her part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program.
The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training
at appropriate points in his/her career. The following narratives and the AFSC 4T0X1 career field
charts and graphics in paragraph 10, define the training career path.


                                                   9
5.1. Apprentice 3-Skill Level. Initial skills training in this specialty consists of the tasks and
knowledge training provided in the 3-skill level resident courses: Medical Laboratory Apprentice/
Phase I located at Medical Education and Training Campus (METC), Fort Sam Houston TX, and
Medical Laboratory Apprentice/ Phase II conducted at designated medical treatment facilities
(MTFs). The decision to train specific tasks and knowledge items in the initial skills courses is based
on a review of OSR data, training requirements analysis data, and 4T0X1 SME input. Task and
knowledge training requirements are identified in the STS in Part II, Section A of the CFETP.
Individuals must complete both initial skills courses (Phase I and Phase II) to be awarded AFSC
4T031.

5.2. Journeyman 5-Skill Level. Upgrade training to the 5-skill level in this specialty consists of
successfully completing: (1) all core tasks specified by an asterisk (*) in column 2 of the STS (see
note below); (2) all STS tasks for the assigned duty position; and (3) Career Development Courses
(CDC) 4T051A, 4T051B, and 4T051C. Once upgraded to the 5-skill level, a journeyman will
maintain proficiency by completing all continuation training required or specified by command or
local policies. SrA will attend Airman Leadership School after reaching 48 months total Air Force
military service or after being selected for promotion to SSgt. Individuals will use their CDCs and
other reference material listed in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) catalog to prepare
for the Specialty Knowledge Test (SKT) portion for promotion under WAPS. They should also
consider continuing their education toward a CCAF degree in Medical Laboratory Technology and
obtaining national certification as a Medical Laboratory Technician. Five-level journeymen are
eligible for application and selection as an instructor for the Medical Laboratory Apprentice/Phase I
and Phase II courses.

NOTE: All core tasks must be trained/certified by task performance, task knowledge, or subject
knowledge. Only tasks (core and non-core) performed in the current duty position will be added to
the duty task list (DTL) in AFTR; however, all core tasks must be trained/certified based on lab size
and capability. In labs where practical [peer 1, 2, 3 (small/medium size)], all core tasks performed in
the lab will be trained to the task performance level. Any core tasks not performed by the lab will be
trained/certified to the subject knowledge (B) level. In large labs (peer 4 and 5 (hospital and medical
center), only those core tasks performed in the assigned duty position must be trained/certified to the
task performance level. All other core tasks can be trained/certified to the subject knowledge (B)
level. There is no requirement to send personnel on temporary duty for core task training. Refer to
AFI 36-2201, paragraphs 7.8.1. and 7.8.1.2. for more information regarding CFETP/AFJQS
documentation requirements.

5.3. Craftsman 7-Skill Level. Upgrade training to the 7-skill level in this specialty consists of
completing: (1) minimum 12 months upgrade training; (2) all STS tasks for the assigned duty
position; and (3) CDCs 4T051A, 4T051B, and 4T051C if not previously completed during 5-skill
level UGT. A laboratory craftsman can be expected to fill various supervisory and management
positions within the laboratory such as noncommissioned officer in charge of the laboratory or a
department. In addition, they may develop work schedules for subordinate personnel and ensure
necessary manning levels are maintained at all times during hours of laboratory operations. Seven-
levels should take courses or obtain added knowledge on management of resources and personnel.
Continued academic education through CCAF and higher degree programs is encouraged.

5.4. Superintendent 9-Skill Level. To be awarded AFSC 4T090, an individual must be a SMSgt
and meet any other requirement specified in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer

                                                  10
and Enlisted). A 9-skill level can be expected to fill positions such as Superintendent of Laboratory
Services or various staff positions within a medical group such as Squadron Superintendent.
Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources, and personnel management should
be pursued through continuing education. Additional higher education and completion of courses
related to their career AFSC are also recommended.

6. Duty Titles. Appropriate duty titles for personnel working in this specialty depend on rank, skill
level, and/or actual duty position as specified on the unit manning document (UMD). Generally,
4T031 personnel will have the title, Medical Laboratory Apprentice; 4T051 personnel will have the
title, Medical Laboratory Journeyman; and 4T071 personnel will have the title, Medical Laboratory
Craftsman. In those instances where a noncommissioned officer is responsible for managing a
distinct element of the laboratory (or the laboratory as a whole) with more than one staff personnel
assigned, the title, NCOIC, XXXX Element/Flight, is appropriate. Additional use of the NCOIC title
should be strictly limited. The NCOIC title is reserved exclusively for NCOs. The Assistant NCOIC
title will not be used. The title Superintendent is used only by SMSgt, or MSgts filling a 4T090
position on the UMD. MSgts and below filling MSgt and below positions will NOT use the title
Superintendent. CMSgt 4T000s may use the title, Manager, XXXX Flight/Squadron. A SMSgt
4T090 assigned to a CMSgt billet may also use the Manager title. 4T0XX personnel are restricted to
one duty title; in instances where personnel hold two significant duties, the duty title should reflect
the position more than 50% of the member’s time is spent performing. For more
guidance/information on appropriate use of duty titles, refer to AFI 36-2618, The Enlisted Force
Structure, Chapter 7.

7. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to
encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 4T0X1 career field. The spectrum
includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet training requirements. The strategy must be
apparent and affordable to reduce training duplication and eliminate a disjointed training approach.
The following training decisions were made during the AFSC 4T0X1 U&TW, held September 2013
at Fort Sam Houston, TX with follow-up coordination conducted by the AFCFM with MFMs and
AETC training personnel.

7.1. Initial Skills Training. The Medical Laboratory Apprentice course must meet the National
Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS) <http://www.naacls.org/>
guidelines. The initial skills course provides Airmen the needed education, motivation, and training
skills necessary to become 3-skill level apprentices.

7.2. 5-Skill Level Upgrade Requirements. Completion of CDCs 4T051A, 4T051B, and 4T051C
are mandatory before the individual is eligible for upgrade to the 5-skill level. NOTE: Core tasks
can be satisfied by the trainee either by demonstrating subject knowledge to the specified skill level
or performing the actual procedure as outlined in paragraph 5.2 (see note). Subject knowledge levels
are used alone when the task is not performed in the current duty position, and appropriate
documentation is annotated on the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation
Sheet.

7.3. 7-Skill Level Upgrade Requirements. Completion of CDCs 4T051A, 4T051B, and 4T051C
(or previous edition), is mandatory if not already accomplished during 5-skill level UGT.
Technicians must complete a minimum of 12 months in 7-skill level UGT and all tasks for the
assigned duty position.
                                                  11
8. Enlisted Medical Badge. Although AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force
Personnel, states the enlisted medical badge is an optional uniform item, it is strongly recommended.
All 4T0X1 personnel authorized to wear the badge signifying their skill level do so proudly,
identifying them as Air Force Medical Service professionals.

8.1. Basic Enlisted Medical Badge. Authorized for wear after award of the 3-skill level. It
is highly encouraged that students graduating from Phase II technical training are awarded this initial
badge as part of their graduation ceremony.

8.2. Senior Enlisted Medical Badge. Worn after award of the 7-skill level.

8.3. Master Enlisted Medical Badge. Authorized for wear by MSgts and above with 5 years in the
specialty from award of the 7-skill level.

9. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Enrollment in CCAF automatically occurs upon
completion of Basic Military Training (BMT). CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an
Associate in Applied Science Degree in Medical Laboratory Technology. Completion of initial skills
training in the Medical Laboratory Apprentice Phase I and Phase II courses satisfies the technical
education and the program elective requirements for a CCAF degree. Additional off-duty education
is a personal choice that is encouraged for all. Individuals desiring to become an AETC Instructor
must possess as a minimum an associate degree or should be actively pursuing an associate degree.
Special Duty Assignment requires an AETC Instructor candidate to have a CCAF degree or be within
one year of completion (45 semester hours [SH]). A degreed faculty is necessary to maintain

consisting of the instructor methods course and supervised practice teaching, CCAF instructors who
possess an associate’s degree or higher may be nominated by their school commander/commandant
for certification as an occupational instructor.

9.4. Trade Skill Certification. When a CCAF student separates or retires, a trade skill certification
is awarded for the primary occupational specialty. The College uses a competency based assessment
process for trade skill certification at one of four proficiency levels: Apprentice, Journeyman,
Craftsman/Supervisor, or Master Craftsman/Manager. All are transcribed on the CCAF transcript.

PART II

Section A – Course/Specialty Training Standard

1. Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for Medical
Laboratory Apprentice Phase I and Medical Laboratory Apprentice Phase II graduating after
1 November 2015.

2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:

2.1. Lists in Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References). Identifies the most
common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for Airman to perform duties in
the 3-, and 5-skill level. Task statements are numbered sequentially (i.e., 1.1., 1.2., 2.1.). Column 2
identifies Core Tasks by asterisk (*) for specialty-wide training requirements and tasks.

2.2. Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and
knowledge training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document
technician qualifications, if available.

2.3. Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the
proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/
knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course. See Air Force Career
Development Academy/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit training manager for current CDC
listings. If the supervisor wants the trainee skilled at a higher level than is indicated, additional
qualification training must occur at the local level, and be documented appropriately on the trainee’s
AF Form 623a, On-the-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet.

2.4. Qualitative Requirements. The page prior to the STS contains the proficiency code key used
to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development
courses.

2.5. Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS). For OJT when placed in AFTR, complete AF
Form 623 Part I, Individual Training Record, and use in accordance with AFI 36-2201. When used
as a JQS, the following requirements apply:

2.5.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training. Identify duty position
requirements by populating STS tasks onto the DTL. As a minimum, complete the following
columns in Part II of the CFETP: Training Completed, Trainee Initials, Trainer Initials, Certifier
Initials (if applicable). An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of
the AFCFM. NOTE: The AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as
needed or deemed necessary for the career field.

2.5.1.1. Transcribing from old CFETP to new CFETP. Refer to AFI 36-2201. The CFM will
provide transcription instructions to the AFTR program manager. This process will be seamless to the
field user as all existing trainee records will be auto-transcribed.

2.5.1.2. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available: the supervisor identifies
STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a minimum,

                                                  19
that trainees cover the mandatory items in AFECD. For 2-time CDC course exam failures, see AFI
36-2201 for specific instructions. NOTE: Career Knowledge must be documented prior to
submitting a CDC waiver.

2.5.1.3. Decertification and Recertification. When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task
previously certified for his or her position, the supervisor utilizes the decertification feature found in
AFTR. Then appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623a, documenting the reason for
decertification. Upon subsequent recertification, document AFTR for any other training
requirements. See AFI 36-2201 for specific instructions.

2.5.2. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and qualified to the Go/No Go level. “Go” means the
individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local demands for accuracy, timeliness,
and correct use of procedures. “No Go” means the individual cannot perform to the required level to
meet local demands. See AFI 36-2201 for specific instructions.

2.6. The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the WAPS. SKTs are
developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by SNCOs with extensive practical
experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by
test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are
based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog. Individual responsibilities are in Chapter 1,
Paragraph 1.19, and Chapter 5 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System.

3. Recommendations. Identify inadequacies and recommended changes to this training standard
through channels to 937 TRG/TTS, 2931 Harney Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234. For convenience,
the Customer Services Information Line (CSIL), DSN 420-1080 (commercial 210-808-1080), has
been installed to promptly report your findings. Be sure to reference specific STS paragraphs when

Explanations
Note 1: A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.
(Example: b and 1b)

Note 2: A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for
a subject common to several tasks.

- This mark is used instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course/CDC. If used after a previous scale
value has been attained/certified, the applicable proficiency level is still required to be validated/certified.

* This mark, in column 2, represents those tasks that must be taught when courses are accelerated in a wartime environment. These tasks will be
taught in the 3-skill level course in a streamlined training environment.

Note 3: In block 2, the * or 7 mark is used to indicate core task requirements in an identified skill level for upgrade training.

                             Air Reserve Component & Requirements

OPR: HQ AFRC/SGM, 115 2d St., Robins AFB, GA 31090-1635, DSN 497-1893.

11. Purpose: This part of the CFETP applies to all 4T0X1s assigned to all AFRC medical units and
squadron medical elements.

11.1. Additional 3-skill level training requirements: Upon graduation from a Phase II Medical
Laboratory Apprentice course, AF Reserve 4T031 personnel will forward a copy of their technical
training school certificate (AF Form 1256) and Student Training Report to their reserve unit of
assignment. The unit will then initiate an AF Form 2096 upgrade action to award the 3-skill level
and enter the member in appropriate training status code (TSC) “B” or “F”. Concurrently, AF
Reserve 4T031 personnel will be assigned to an active duty medical laboratory for up to 60 days or a
minimum of 45 days to demonstrate competency on all core tasks as listed in this CFETP. Active
duty trainers and/or task certifiers must ensure trainees satisfy core task training elements to the
specified proficiency code(s). Upon completion of core tasks, trainees will be officially entered into
5-skill level UGT.

11.2. Additional 5-skill level training requirements: None. Requirements are the same as for
active duty Air Force (ADAF) upgrade trainees.

11.3. Additional 7-skill level training requirements: None. Requirements are the same as for
ADAF upgrade trainees.

                           Air National Guard Training Requirements
OPR: ANGRC/SGCT, 3500 Fetchet Ave, Andrews AFB, MD, DSN 278-8559.

12. Purpose: This part of the CFETP applies to all 4T0X1s assigned to all Air National Guard
medical units.

12.1. Additional 3-skill level training requirements: Upon completion of Phase I and Phase II
technical training, each medical laboratory apprentice (4T031) will be evaluated by their medical unit
commander for an additional 30-60 days of proficiency/seasoning training. This training must be
accomplished at an active duty MTF within 1 year of completing Phase II. This training is highly
recommended for ANG personnel, who are not in or pursuing, a related civilian occupation. To
ensure continuity between resident (Phase I and Phase II) and subsequent clinical (UGT) training, the
apprentice will forward a copy of his/her technical school certificate (AF Form 1256) and Student
Training Report to their unit of assignment. The ANG unit will then initiate upgrade action using AF
Form 2096 to award the 3-skill level and enter the apprentice in the appropriate (TSC) “B” or “F.”
This action will begin the 3-month apprenticeship phase while accomplishing MTF
proficiency/seasoning training.

12.2. Additional 5-Skill Level Training Requirements: None. Requirements are the same as for
ADAF upgrade trainees.

12.3. Additional 7- Skill Level Training Requirements: None. Requirements are the same as for
ADAF upgrade trainees.
