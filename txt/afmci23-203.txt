SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates procedures when excess non-NSN RDT&E assets are generated. The
contents in this instruction should be reviewed in their entirely.
1. Authorized Users of This Instruction. All RDT&E Logistics Materiel Control Activity
(LMCA) supported activities in Attachment 2 use the procedures in this instruction. Activities
that are tenants on other Major Command (MAJCOM) bases must make sure host-tenant support

agreements and contracts that require supply support from field activities stipulate that supply
support procedures conform to this publication and AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual,
Volume II, Part Two, Chapter 21, Section A.
2. Exclusions Property. Local excess property in the following categories is not covered by
this instruction. Refer to AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 3 to process property that
is:
     2.1. Perishable.
     2.2. Dangerous to public health and safety/hazardous.
     2.3. Condemned.
     2.4. Serviceable or non-NSN RDT&E items with an extended unit cost less than $5000.
     2.5. Automatic Data Processing Equipment (ADPE) AFI 33-112, Information Technology
     Hardware Asset Management.
     2.6. Excess contractor inventory equipment accounted for under Federal Acquisition
     Regulations (FAR).
     2.7. Non-NSN administrative support equipment.
     2.8. Expendable.
     2.9. Equipment Management Code (EMC) 1-coded equipment.
     2.10. Reparable Items.
3. Roles and Responsibilities.
     3.1. The LMCAs will:
        3.1.1. Manage and account for experimental and non-NSN RDT&E equipment.
        3.1.2. Identify and report monthly excess list from the accumulated notifications and
        transmit electronically via Electronic Mail (e-mail) to the activities identified in
        Attachment 2. Negative reports are not required. If necessary, reproduce the lists locally.
        RDT&E equipment is costly and must be reused as much as possible. The following
        types of equipment are reportable:
            3.1.2.1. Excess non-NSN RDT&E items with a unit cost of $5,000 or more.
            3.1.2.2. Excess non-NSN RDT&E items are exempt from Air Force Equipment
            Management System (AFEMS) 120-day excess reporting.
        3.1.3. Make sure reported items are available for shipment. Provide an item description,
        Non-stock number, the excess quantity and the unit price, the disposal condition code that
        best indicates the asset's condition as prescribed by DOD 4160.21-M, Defense Materiel
        Disposition Manual, and give the name and telephone number (DSN or commercial) of
        the supply representative or of the last user who can give more information.
        3.1.4. Hold excess items for 45 days based on the date of the original e-mail so activities
        have time to screen the excess list. When excess non-NSN RDT&E assets are generated,
        activities without storage facilities and other unique limitation are specifically authorized
        to announce accelerated screening of items no less than 10 workdays.
AFMCI23-203 30 NOVEMBER 2011                                                                     3


       3.1.5. Make sure excess lists received from other activities are given to activities to
       permit maximum screening. An activity that wants items from an excess list will send
       the reporting activity an e-mail requesting specific equipment. The gaining activity will
       include the excess list, the data that describes the items, the quantity required, the
       shipping address (Stock Record Account Number [SRAN] and marked-for), and the
       transportation appropriation. All activities that receive excess non-NSN RDT&E
       equipment are authorized non-reimbursable issue according to AFMAN 23-110, Volume
       1, Part 1, Chapter 11.
       3.1.6. Forward the gaining activities’ requests to Logistics Readiness Squadrons (LRS).
       3.1.7. Ensure the requestors provide Transportation appropriation via e-mail to which
       packing/crating and transportation costs may be charged.
       3.1.8. Turn-in property to LRS for processing to DLA Disposition Services if the
       LMCAs do not get requests for all of the excess items within 45 days based on date of e-
       mailed list.
   3.2. LRS/Materiel Management activity will:
       3.2.1. (Gaining unit) Process the item record load inputs (FIL) using information in
       paragraph 3.1.3. Prior to the losing unit initiating actions.
       3.2.2. Process AFEMS transactions IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume 2, Part 2, Chapter 22
       for all movement of equipment involving Redistribution Orders (RDO) procedures.
          3.2.2.1. (Losing unit) Process the Equipment Accountability Transfer Single
          Selection transaction (1ETT) to the gaining DODAAC and e-mail the output
          document to the gaining LMCA when the LMCA receives a request for an excess
          item.
          3.2.2.2. (Losing unit) Ensure available technical data, tools, spare parts, manuals,
          and supporting documentation accompanies the shipment.
