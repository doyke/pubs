     message/memorandum will include name, rank, security clearance, restricted area badge
     number, and aircraft specialty code of each team member.
  2.5.4. (Added-ACC) Conduct of Visits:
     2.5.4.1. (Added-ACC) "Overall Unit Rating" is determined by combining the OGV and
     squadron ratings. The OGV rating is based on compliance with paragraph 3.2 and the
     performance of OGV and squadron-assigned flight examiners during objectivity
     evaluations administered by the HHQ team. Squadron ratings are based on compliance
     with paragraph 3.3 and the performance of assigned/attached aircrews during flight and
     EP/ATD evaluations. In addition to the areas outlined in para 3.2. and 3.3., the OGV and
     squadron rating will include an assessment (5-tier rating) of the following programs: -
     Operations Supervision as outlined in AFI 11-418, Operations Supervision - Technical
     Order maintenance/management as outlined in T.O. 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order
     System and AFI 11-215.
        2.5.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) The overall unit rating will not be higher than Satisfactory
        if the overall OGV program rating is Unsatisfactory.
        2.5.4.1.2. (Added-ACC) The overall OGV/squadron grade will not be higher than
        Satisfactory if any OGV/squadron program is rated Unsatisfactory.
     2.5.4.2. (Added-ACC) Aircrew performance during evaluations will comprise 50
     percent of squadron rating. Stan/Eval programs, procedures and compliance will
     comprise the other 50 percent. HHQ teams will comment on unit supervision and will
     identify Limiting Factors (LIMFACs) noted for higher headquarters action that adversely
     affect the unit's mission accomplishment. If appropriate, HHQ teams may comment on a
     distinct level of supervision within the unit.
     2.5.4.3. (Added-ACC) Stan/Eval programs, to include FE Objectivity Evaluations and
     OGV/SQ Operations Supervision will receive a 5-tier rating.
        2.5.4.3.1. (Added-ACC) OUTSTANDING. Performance and procedures in effect
        were error-free and far exceeded all requirements. Program serves as a model which
        others should emulate.
        2.5.4.3.2. (Added-ACC) EXCELLENT. Performance and procedures in effect
        exceeded requirements and enhanced overall effectiveness.
        2.5.4.3.3. (Added-ACC) SATISFACTORY. Performance and/or operations met
        mission requirements. Procedures and activities were carried out in an effective and
        competent manner. Resources and programs were efficiently managed. Minor
        deficiencies existed but do not impede or limit mission accomplishment.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                  15


       2.5.4.3.4. (Added-ACC) MARGINAL. Most requirements were met, but not in
       full compliance with directives. Performance and the effectiveness of the program
       were degraded by deviations from procedures.
       2.5.4.3.5. (Added-ACC) UNSATISFACTORY. Deviations or omissions caused
       the program(s) evaluated to be non-effective. Little compliance with appropriate
       directives was evident.
    2.5.4.4. (Added-ACC) MAJCOM/NAF Flying-Related Special Interest Items (SIIs).
    SIIs are established by the MAJCOM/NAF to focus attention on operations related areas
    and will be evaluated during formal visits. Compliance will be reflected in all ratings and
    evaluations, and will be commented on separately in formal visit reports.
    2.5.4.5. (Added-ACC) A representative sample (20 to 35 percent) of supervisors,
    instructors, and line (experienced and inexperienced) aircrews will be evaluated during
    the visit. Crewmembers maintaining multiple qualifications may be evaluated in either
    aircraft. All flight examiners may receive a FE Objectivity Evaluation (flight or ground).
       2.5.4.5.1. (Added-ACC) Individuals and/or crews identified to be evaluated in the
       notification messages will, to the maximum extent possible, have all evaluation
       requisites, except those directed by the inspection team, completed prior to the formal
       visit to facilitate completion of AF Forms 8 prior to departure of the inspection team.
       2.5.4.5.2. (Added-ACC) Full notice evaluations are appropriate for those
       administered by unit flight examiners where a HHQ flight examiner will observe and
       administer a FE Objectivity Evaluation. The full flight evaluation profile should be
       planned by the examinee. These evaluations will constitute an evaluation of the
       examinee (conducted by the unit FE), as well as the unit flight examiner's objectivity
       and the unit's flight evaluation profiles (conducted by the HHQ FE).
       2.5.4.5.3. (Added-ACC) No-notice evaluations will be administered to individuals
       by notifying the unit at an appropriate time (if the individual is already on the flying
       schedule) or by requesting that an individual be added to the next day's schedule for
       this purpose. Any additional or unique HHQ FE evaluation requirements, beyond the
       scheduled mission profile, will be communicated to the examinee no later than 24
       hours prior to designated aircrew briefing to facilitate mission planning.
       2.5.4.5.4. (Added-ACC) Flight evaluations/EPEs administered by HHQ flight
       examiners within 6 months of a formal Stan/Eval visit may be counted toward the
       flight evaluation sample for that visit. If this option is exercised, all intermediate
       flight evaluations by HHQ flight examiners (including inspection team designated
       augmentees) must count toward that sample. The unit DO or OG/CC must be
       coordinated with prior to the 6 month period.
    2.5.4.6. (Added-ACC) In addition to aircrew flight evaluations, all available
    CMR/BMC aircrew will be administered a 50 question closed book written examination
    and have their flight publications evaluated. Flight publication checks will include all
    issued flight manuals/T.O.s, checklists, and OGV issued aircrew aids.
       2.5.4.6.1. (Added-ACC) The written examination will consist of 50 questions from
       the specific MDS MQF. The inspection team may substitute 10% of questions with
 16       AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


            non-MQF questions developed by the inspection team. These questions, if used, will
            reflect local procedures, FCIFs, and SIIs. If non-MQF questions are used, topics will
            be identified in the 60-day message.
                2.5.4.6.1.1. (Added-ACC) The 50 question written examination administered
                during a Stan/Eval formal inspection may fulfill either the requisite closed-book
                examination requirement, if it meets all the appropriate criteria, or the semi-
                annual test requirement at the discretion of the OG/CC.
            2.5.4.6.2. (Added-ACC) The minimum passing grade for the written examination is
            85%.

                UNIT STAN/EVAL FUNCTIONS AND ORGANIZATION

3.1. Scope. Units include levels of organization under HHQs required to establish a stan/eval
function for purposes of this instruction. Most units are composed of an Operations Group (OG)
and flying squadrons. Where there is no parent OG, squadrons/detachments will assume duties
listed for OGs, where applicable.
3.2. Operations Group. The conduct of the unit level stan/eval program is directed by the
OG/CC.
3.2. (ACC)Operations Group. OG/OGV is responsible for all stan/eval functions unless
delegated to subordinate squadrons.
   3.2.1. Operations Group Commander Responsibilities. Specific responsibilities of the
   OG/CC that relate to the stan/eval program:
       3.2.1.1. Establish and provide manpower to staff a stan/eval function to perform the
       duties directed by this instruction.
          3.2.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) Provide a suitable facility and resources to accommodate
          the Stan/Eval function.
       3.2.1.2. Ensure materials provided for mission planning are accurate and current.
       3.2.1.2. (ACC) Ensure adequate aircrew briefing facilities are provided at the unit level.
       Attachment 10 (Added) of this supplement contains guidance for the minimum mission
       planning materials required to conduct an adequate aircrew briefing.
       3.2.1.3. Provide a suitable stan/eval testing area.
       3.2.1.3. (ACC) A suitable Stan/Eval testing facility is one that provides a quiet,
       distraction-free atmosphere and allows easy monitoring of examinees by Stan/Eval
       personnel.
       3.2.1.4. Direct evaluations to maintain a quality aircrew force.
       3.2.1.5. Direct supplementary evaluations.
       3.2.1.6. Chair and determine the composition of the SEB.
   3.2.2. Operations Group Stan/Eval Functions. At the Operations Group stan/eval (OGV)
   level, emphasis is on unit standardization. Under direction of the Chief of OGV, flight
   examiners will ensure standardization among squadrons and squadron-assigned flight
   examiners. The OGV will:
   3.2.2. (ACC) Primary oversight and administration of the unit Stan/Eval program will
   reside with OGV. OG/OGV will ensure objectivity and enforce the pyramid evaluation
   structure to the maximum extent possible.
       3.2.2.1. Establish procedures for review and quality control of AF Forms 8, Certificate of
       Aircrew Qualification, and AF Forms 8a, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification (Multiple
       Aircraft).

    3.2.2.2. Establish procedures to maintain and review unit Flight Evaluation Folders
    (FEFs). Document these procedures in unit supplements to this instruction. Maintain unit
    FEFs, if applicable.
       3.2.2.2.1. (Added-SJAFB) Initial Review: Squadron DOV will accomplish an
       initial review upon receipt of a memberâ€™s FEF during in-processing.
       3.2.2.2.2. (Added-SJAFB) Annual Review: Squadron DOV will accomplish an
       annual review on all FEFs at once during December of each year. Procedures are
       outlined in Chapter 7.
    3.2.2.3. Establish procedures for the Aircrew Examination Program according to
    Chapter 6 and Chapter 8 of this instruction. Document Aircrew Examination Program
    in the unit supplement to this instruction.
    3.2.2.4. Establish and maintain a trend program.
       3.2.2.4.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
       3.2.2.4.1. (ACC) Trend analysis will include all flight and EP evaluations as well as
       all requisite and periodic written examinations. ACC Form 8a or PEX may be used to
       document trend information. Any documents used to track trend information will be
       kept and disposed of IAW instructions on title page of this supplement.
           3.2.2.4.1.1. (Added-SJAFB) The 4 OG trend is defined as a 15% discrepancy
           rate for permanent party, or 25% for formal course students. If the sample size is
           10 or less, a trend will be defined as a 30% discrepancy rate.
       3.2.2.4.2. For units with more than one type of aircraft, combine discrepancies
       common to all aircraft/aircrews to determine trends (e.g., instrument procedures).
       3.2.2.4.3. For Formal Training Units (FTUs)/Combat Crew Training Squadrons
       (CCTSs), maintain separate trend data for students and qualified/instructor aircrews.
           3.2.2.4.3.1. (Added-SJAFB) FTU Squadrons will track FTU student testing
           trends and report trend data to OGV at the completion of each class Open and
           Closed book. FTU Squadrons will maintain trend data for 12 months.
       3.2.2.4.4. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an
       OPR/Office of Collateral Responsibility (OCR); report trends and status to the
       OG/CC during the SEB until closed. OGV will publish and define the trend program

supervisor, NAF or MAJCOM.


         3.2.4.1. (Added-ACC) OGV FEs may conduct evaluations in all squadrons in their
         wing flying aircraft/missions in which they are qualified. To increase objectivity and
         standardization across the wing, whenever possible, squadron FEs should give checkrides
         in squadrons in which they are not primarily assigned/attached (exception: FTU student
         evaluations).
            3.2.4.1.1. (Added-SJAFB) OGV FEs who have not completed an F-15E formal
            instructor course will not administer checkrides to FTU students.
         3.2.4.2. (Added-ACC) When no qualified examiner is available above the examinee in
         the pyramid evaluation structure or chain of command, the highest available evaluator
         will administer the evaluation. Deviations will be documented in the additional
         comments section of the Form 8.
         3.2.4.3. (Added-ACC) Examinees requiring NAF or MAJCOM examiners will consult

   4.4.1. Flying NAF/CCs and OG/CCs may maintain flight examiner status in their primary
   assigned aircraft. Vice commanders and deputies may perform this function if the principal
   incumbent is not qualified or available.
   4.4.2. NAF/CCs, OG/CCs, and OG/CDs that fly different aircraft from the OG/CC in multi-
   MDS wings, do not require, nor do they have to maintain, instructor certification or
   MR/CMR status. To become a flight examiner, NAF/CCs, OG/CCs, and applicable OG/CDs,
   must maintain BMC status and be flight examiner certified. For other than SPOT evaluations,
   Senior Flight Examiners will evaluate only events for which they are current and at a level
   for which they are qualified.
   4.4.2. (ACC) Senior Flight Examiners will not perform instructor duties unless instructor
   qualified. Senior Examiners will not conduct initial or requalification instructor evaluations
   unless instructor qualified. Senior Examiner upgrade and documentation will be outlined in
   the unit supplement of the unit to which they are attached for flying.
      4.4.2.1. (Added-SJAFB) Senior Evaluators will complete a modified Flight Examiner
      upgrade based on their experience.
4.5. Requirement. Aircrew positions that do not require a flight phase evaluation do not
require flight examiners.

                                       EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes three types of evaluations to ensure
qualification of aircrew members and standardization of operations. Aircrew qualification
evaluations are administered periodically and documented on the AF Forms 8/8a to ensure
aircrew qualification. EPEs are requisites for some aircrew qualification evaluations.
Supplementary evaluations are unstructured tools to be used by the commander to ensure
standardization of flying and other operations.
5.2. Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. Aircrew qualification evaluations consist of two
structured phases, ground and flight. Each phase requires the completion of requisite tasks. The
ground phase, when required, includes a series of examinations and evaluation of aircrew
performance in a controlled emergency procedures environment. The flight phase includes an
inflight or, if applicable, simulator evaluation of aircrew performance. EXCEPTION: For
specialized aircrew qualified IAW Universal Qualification guidance see paragraph 5.2.18.
   5.2.1. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Categories. There are five types of aircrew
   qualification evaluations. Periodic aircrew qualification evaluations are administered to
   ensure basic qualification in the MDS and crew position of an aircrew member (QUAL),
   qualification to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (INSTM, when applicable)
   and qualification to employ the MDS of the aircrew member in accomplishing the unitâ€™s
   operational mission (MSN). Evaluations are accomplished to ensure aircrew are certified and
   maintain instructor qualification (INSTR). Evaluation and certification of specific aircrew
   performance may also be accomplished (SPOT). Aircrew will complete the following types
   of aircrew certification evaluations as appropriate:
   5.2.1. (ACC) Use of simulators for the flight phase of flight evaluations is not approved by
   HQ ACC, unless flight phases/events evaluated are coded SIMCERT 1.
       5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in
       their primary assigned aircraft, to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI
       11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
           5.2.1.1.1. (Added-SJAFB) Flight Examiners will check the examineeâ€™s issued
           aircrew publications for currency and correctness during the EPE in any evaluation.
           Document the publications check on the ACC Form 8A.
       5.2.1.2. INSTM Evaluations. All Air Force pilots (and other pilots flying operationally
       with the Air Force, e.g., exchange pilots) will maintain instrument qualification.
       EXCEPTION: Indoctrination flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI 11-401,
       Aviation Management; USAF Test Pilot School students; TG-series aircraft pilots;
       USAFA T-41 and T-51 pilots. Note: Pilots assigned to excepted aircraft who may also be
       assigned to other aircraft that are not excepted will maintain instrument qualification in
       non-excepted aircraft. To obtain/maintain instrument qualification, pilots must
       successfully complete a periodic INSTM evaluation.
           5.2.1.2.1. A commander may revoke the instrument qualification of any pilot under
           his/her command who fails to maintain minimum instrument flying skills. To revoke
32    AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


        an instrument qualification for reasons not related to an evaluation, use the
        procedures in Chapter 7 for a commander-directed downgrade.
        5.2.1.2.2. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification may not fly as a
        pilot in aircraft in which instrument qualification is required except in a training
        program leading to requalification. Pilots in this situation must be in supervised
        status. (Does not apply to pilots in excepted situations listed in paragraph 5.2.1.2)
        5.2.1.2.3. (Added-ACC) The written instrument exam will be successfully
        completed as a requisite for the qualification evaluation for navigators/WSOs/EWOs
        with flight instruments used for navigation at their station. The instrument
        examination will consist of a minimum of 50 questions.
     5.2.1.3. MSN Evaluations. All aircrew members maintaining MR/CMR or BMC
     aircrew status will complete a periodic MSN evaluation in their primary assigned aircraft,
     to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
     The MSN evaluation should reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required in the
     performance of normal operational and training sorties. The requirement for a MSN
     evaluation may be waived for those aircraft where performance of normal operational,
     test and training sorties involves tasks covered during the accomplishment of an INSTM
     and/or QUAL evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2. QUAL and
     MSN evaluations may be combined into a single evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2
     MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
        5.2.1.3.1. (Added-ACC) Units will determine the scope of these evaluations and
        adhere to the appropriate overall grading criteria in this volume. Tactical
        employment subareas will be evaluated and graded according to parameters in AFI
        11-2MDS Volume 2.
        5.2.1.3.2. (Added-ACC) BMC aircrew members will be evaluated on their ability to
        fly missions routinely performed by the examinee.
        5.2.1.3.3. (Added-SJAFB) The 4 OG/CC goal is to fly 15% of Operational MSN
        Evaluations at night.
     5.2.1.4. INSTR Evaluations. Aircrew members maintaining instructor qualification in a
     particular MDS aircraft must complete initial and periodic evaluations of instructional
     capability in that MDS aircraft. Specialized qualified, universally qualified, or multiple
     qualified aircrew maintaining instructor qualification in multiple similar aircraft will
     accomplish initial and periodic evaluations as specified in MAJCOM Supplements and/or
     AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
     5.2.1.4. (ACC) The emphasis on an initial instructor evaluation should be placed on
     examinee demonstration of instructional ability. This does not preclude the update of a
     required periodic evaluation if all required flight phase requirements are completed
     during the instructor flight evaluation and the examinee subsequently completes all
     ground phase requirements for the evaluation within the periods described in paragraph
     5.2.7. Label the evaluation appropriately (EXAMPLE: "INIT INSTR/MSN"). Do not
     add on missions (sorties) to complete the requirements for a periodic evaluation unless
     the group/squadron commander concurs.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                    33


       5.2.1.4.1. To initially qualify as an instructor in a particular MDS aircraft, the aircrew
       member must successfully complete an initial instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation.
       Accomplish INIT INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions whenever
       possible. When students are not available or mission requirements/crew composition
       requirements prevent inclusion of students, another crewmember or the evaluator may
       serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examineeâ€™s instructional ability.
       5.2.1.4.2. Periodic evaluation of the ability of aircrew members to instruct will be
       conducted during all subsequent periodic evaluations. The AF Form 8/8a
       Mission/Check description for these periodic evaluations will not include INSTR as
       the AF Form 8/8a aircraft/crew position is already annotated with highest
       qualification demonstrated during the previous evaluation (e.g. IB, IN, IP).
       5.2.1.4.3. If instructor qualification is lost in an MDS aircraft, it may be regained
       through an instructor requalification evaluation (see paragraphs 5.2.3.2.2 and
       5.2.3.2.4) as directed in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1.
    5.2.1.5. SPOT Evaluations â€“Flight or Ground (Optional). A SPOT evaluation is an
    evaluation not intended to satisfy the requirements of a periodic evaluation (e.g., INSTM,
    QUAL, MSN or INSTR). SPOT evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements,
    unless specified in MAJCOM supplements. An evaluation that begins as a SPOT
    evaluation may become (and be documented as) a required periodic evaluation if all
    required flight phase requirements are completed during the SPOT eval and the examinee
    subsequently completes all ground phase requirements for the evaluation within the
    periods described in paragraph 5.2.7 Do not add on missions (flights) to complete the
    requirements for a periodic evaluation unless the group/squadron commander concurs
    with the aircrew memberâ€™s desire to realign the evaluation expiration date and approves
    the additional flight time requirements. Evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1
    5.2.1.4 will be documented as SPOT evaluations. Note: When the flight examiner
    administering a SPOT evaluation is not qualified in the MDS and same crew position of
    the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited towards a periodic evaluation.
       5.2.1.5.1. (Added-ACC) FE Objectivity Evaluations. An evaluation of the
       objectivity and skill of a lower echelon flight examiner in administering a
       flight/EP/ATD evaluation. Use SPOT as the type of evaluation under the Ground or
       Flight Phase, then explain in the mission description that the evaluation was a FE
       Objectivity Evaluation. Overall rating for this type of an evaluation will be either
       qualified (1) or unqualified (3).
           5.2.1.5.1.1. (Added-ACC) The grading criteria in Attachment 11 (Added) will
           be used.
           5.2.1.5.1.2. (Added-ACC) A qualified rating (1) indicates that the FE objectivity
           examinee complied with HHQ and local Stan/Eval directives, properly briefed
           and debriefed the examinee, correctly identified discrepancies, awarded the
           correct grade for each evaluated area, awarded the appropriate overall grade and,
           if required, assigned appropriate additional training.
           5.2.1.5.1.3. (Added-ACC) An unqualified rating (3) will be awarded when the
           flight examiner failed to satisfy the requirements of a qualification rating (1). The
34     AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


             certification of the lower level FE receiving and unqualified FE Objectivity
             Evaluation will be determined by the SQ/CC or OG/CC as applicable. The
             SQ/CC or OG/CC may, at his/her discretion issue a commander directed AF Form
             8 for the examinee based upon the higher level FE recommendation.
         5.2.1.5.2. (Added-SJAFB) Instructor Pilot Rear Cockpit Evaluation. Once
         obtained, rear cockpit landing qualification expiration will be aligned with the
         INSTM/QUAL evaluation period.
             5.2.1.5.2.1. (Added-SJAFB) If the initial rear cockpit evaluation is completed as
             part of an Instructor upgrade program and occurs within the examineeâ€™s
             INSTM/QUAL eligibility period, the rear cockpit landing SPOT will be
             documented on the Instructor Form 8 and does not need to be evaluated a second
             time for the INSTM/QUAL evaluation.
  5.2.2. Combined Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. To promote efficient use of flying
  resources, accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical. If combined, include the
  designation of each evaluation in the Flight Phase of the AF Form 8, e.g., QUAL/MSN or
  INSTM/QUAL/MSN. Evaluations in multiple crew positions will be addressed in MAJCOM
  supplements.
  5.2.3. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used,
  when applicable, to further describe the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1 - 5.2.1.5:
     5.2.3.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor
     qualification in an MDS (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT MSN, INIT INSTR).
     5.2.3.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of
     qualification due to expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency, a flight
     recheck following a failed periodic evaluation (see paragraph 7.3.9 for ground
     rechecks), or loss of qualification due to a commander-directed downgrade.
         5.2.3.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic
         evaluation, the evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic
         evaluation. The AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an
         RQ prefix. Note: When expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure
         to complete one or more of the ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.2.4), the
         flight evaluation has successfully been completed within the eligibility period for an
         in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in paragraph 5.2.7.2
         for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, and the OG/CC determines that
         qualification will be re-established by completion of the ground requisites without re-
         accomplishment of the flight evaluation or completed ground requisites as outlined in
         paragraph 5.2.16, the AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will not be
         documented with an RQ prefix.
         5.2.3.2.2. When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile
         will be as directed by the squadron commander and will include, as a minimum, those
         items for which the individual is non-current. The AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check
         description will be documented with RQ SPOT. See also AFI 11-202, Volume 1,
         Aircrew Training, for policy regarding loss of currency.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                35


       5.2.3.2.3. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass a flight evaluation, the
       recheck evaluation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.2.13 The AF Form
       8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT,
       as applicable.
       5.2.3.2.4. When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade (see
       paragraph 7.4.8), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the commander. The
       AF Form 8/8a Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or
       RQ SPOT, as applicable.
       5.2.3.2.5. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No
       qualification was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
       5.2.3.2.6. When requalification deals with instructor capability, the AF Form 8/8a
       Mission/Check description will be documented with RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
    5.2.3.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified
    of the evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The
    beginning of normal preparation for a mission will be determined by the flight examiner
    and may be defined in supplements to this instruction. The intent is to preclude
    extraordinary preparation for the mission.
       5.2.3.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of
       daily aircrew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
       5.2.3.3.2. An examinee may utilize a no-notice evaluation to update a
       QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the
       evaluation are completed within the periods described in paragraph 5.2.7. If all
       requirements were not completed on the first flight, subsequent flights are authorized
       to complete required events. If the examinee elects not to update a
       QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be documented
       as a N/N SPOT evaluation.
       5.2.3.3.3. (Added-SJAFB) The 4 OG/CC no-notice goal is 15% annually per
       squadron (permanent party only in the FTU squadrons). No-Notice evaluations
       should be distributed equally among evaluation types, crew position and crew
       qualification. Distribution will be tracked by OGV and reported in the SEB. Prior to
       the beginning of each new CY quarter, OGV will notify DOVs of their current
       progress toward this goal.
       5.2.3.3.4. (Added-SJAFB) Squadron DOVs will produce a list of individuals
       recommended for No-Notice evaluations at the beginning of each quarter. Rationale
       may include, but is not limited to: recent upgrade status, downgrades on previous
       checkrides, recent commander-directed downgrade, acceptance of MR status from a
       previous assignment, or distribution amongst crew position/evaluation type.
       5.2.3.3.5. (Added-SJAFB) Squadron DOVs should plan on executing No-Notice
       checkrides NLT the 3d month of an examineeâ€™s zone.
       5.2.3.3.6. (Added-SJAFB) No-Notice notification should occur no-earlier than the
       beginning of normal mission planning, and no later than scheduled brief time.
36     AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


     5.2.3.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted
     in a simulator.
     5.2.3.5. Multiple Prefixes. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation
     (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined
     evaluations and the purpose for any prefixes will be explained under Mission Description
     in the Examinerâ€™s Remarks (see paragraphs 7.3.7.3 and 7.4.7.3).
  5.2.4. Ground Phase Requisites. The ground phase for periodic aircrew evaluations
  includes requisites listed below. See Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional guidance on
  aircrew examinations.
     5.2.4.1. QUAL Evaluations. Open book examination, closed book examination,
     Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) examination / EPE (if applicable).
     5.2.4.2. INSTM Evaluations. Instrument examination.
     5.2.4.3. MSN Evaluations. As specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2.
  5.2.5. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew evaluations include execution
  in the MDS or, if applicable, a suitable simulator profile that will allow evaluation of aircrew
  performance. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all
  appropriate requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and allow
  accurate measure of the proficiency of the examinee. Evaluation profiles will reflect unit
  tasking, daily training missions, be realistic, and incorporate current tactics applicable to the
  unit mission.
  5.2.6. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
     5.2.6.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
     17th month following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a
     periodic evaluation in which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 04 expires on 31
     Mar 06.).
     5.2.6.2. Scheduling. Schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility period (six-month
     period prior to expiration date).
         5.2.6.2.1. (Added-SJAFB) At the beginning of each month, DOVs will post a copy
         of the PEX zone management printout (or suitable alternative) on the Stan/Eval
         bulletin board for aircrew reference.
         5.2.6.2.2. (Added-SJAFB) Squadron DOV will provide a copy of the zone
         management printout (or suitable alternate) to the SQ/CC and Scheduling.
         5.2.6.2.3. (Added-SJAFB) When an individual enters the eligibility periodic for a
         periodic evaluation, squadron DOV will notify the individual and their Flt/CC via
         email, assign any PEX requisite tests to the individual, and may assign a Go/No-Go
         date IAW squadron policy.
         5.2.6.2.4. (Added-SJAFB) At the beginning of each month, DOV will build a
         Checkride in Progress (CIP) folders for all individuals entering their eligibility period.
         CIP folders will contain EPE and Flight ACC Forms 8A and a Draft AF Form 8
         (scratch and sniff). CIP folders will be kept in six hanging file holder/in-containers,
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                               37


       with each folder representing a month of the zone, and will be moved up one folder at
       the beginning of each month.
    5.2.6.3. Extended Evaluations. Periodic evaluations may be extended on a case-by-
    case basis according to the following criteria:
       5.2.6.3.1. Squadron Commander-Extended Evaluations. Squadron commanders
       may extend the expiration date of periodic evaluations up to three months for the
       reasons listed below.
          5.2.6.3.1.1. Individuals assigned PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
          5.2.6.3.1.2. Individuals departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft
          type.
          5.2.6.3.1.3. Individuals undergoing unit aircraft conversion.
          5.2.6.3.1.4. Individual removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or
          retirement from the Service).
          5.2.6.3.1.5. Individuals participating in real world operations (to include
          operations other than war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required
          flight evaluation(s) before or during deployment. This will be on a case-by-case
          basis and is not authority to grant blanket extensions for scheduled operational
          deployments.
          5.2.6.3.1.5. (ACC) This also includes unavailability of aircraft/assets due to
          deployments in support of real world operations.
       5.2.6.3.2. For squadron commanders and above, the approval authority is the next
       commander in the memberâ€™s flying chain of command, with the concurrence of the
       memberâ€™s immediate supervisor, IAW the guidance provided in paragraph 5.2.6.3.1
       For individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, AF/A3O-A is the approval authority.
       5.2.6.3.3. HHQ-Extended Evaluations. HQ USAF/A3O-A may authorize the
       extension of expiration dates of periodic aircrew qualification evaluations.
       5.2.6.3.4. Documentation. Document extensions with a memorandum for record
       (MFR) placed in Section II of the FEF specifying extension authority, the new
       expiration date, and include a brief description of the extension.
          5.2.6.3.4.1. Extension MFRs will be dated prior to the expiration date of any
          affected periodic evaluation.
          5.2.6.3.4.2. File the MFR on top of the affected AF Form 8/8a in Section II of the
          FEF.
          5.2.6.3.4.3. Requisites not completed during original eligibility period must be
          completed prior to extended expiration date indicated on the MFR.
          5.2.6.3.4.4. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
          AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments,
          when action is complete and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record
          become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed
          by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a. Example: If an
38     AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


             evaluation was extended based on an HHQ waiver, an MFR will remain in the
             FEF until such time as the next evaluation is completed. That waiver reference is
             commented on in para D of the Form 8/8a.
     5.2.6.4. Requirements Before Permanent Change of Station/Temporary Duty. If a
     periodic evaluation will expire within three months after the proposed departure for a
     Permanent Change of Station (PCS) to a flying assignment in the same aircraft MDS, or
     during an upcoming Temporary Duty (TDY) (flying or non-flying), complete the
     required evaluation(s) before departing for either the PCS flying assignment or the TDY.
     Obtain a MAJCOM stan/eval waiver for unusual situations.
  5.2.7. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements
  of combined evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2. Requisites from a
  completed evaluation may be used for subsequent evaluations provided they cover all
  required areas and are within the requisite zone for each evaluation. See also paragraph
  5.3.1. For aircrew possessing multiple instrument qualifications, the instrument exam may
  count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam occurs for each evaluation IAW
  the provisions of paragraphs 5.2.7.1and 5.2.7.2 For all evaluations, accomplish requisites as
  follows:
     5.2.7.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in
     the eligibility period, all requisites must be completed within the six-month eligibility
     period prior to the expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that
     expiration date.
         5.2.7.1.1. (Added-SJAFB) The 4 OG goal is to have requisites complete by the end
         of the 4th month of the eligibility period, with the flight complete by the end of the
         5th month. Squadrons may set more conservative requirements than these.
     5.2.7.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations outside the eligibility
     period, all requisites must be completed within a six-month period encompassing the
     month in which the flight evaluation was administered. EXCEPTION: For extended
     evaluations, requisites may be completed between the beginning of the six-month
     eligibility period prior to the original expiration date and the extended expiration date.
     5.2.7.3. Recheck. For evaluations used to remedy a failed evaluation:
         5.2.7.3.1. Requisites that were valid for a failed evaluation per paragraph 5.2.7.1 or
         5.2.7.2 remain valid, IAW paragraph 5.2.13.1
         5.2.7.3.2. Valid requisite completion dates from the Q-3 AF Form 8/8a will not be
         annotated on the recheck AF Form 8/8a. The recheck AF Form 8/8a will only include
         documentation of the flight phase evaluation, unless requisites were not completed or
         are required to complete the recheck. If the flight recheck is completed prior to
         completion of required requisites, delay completion of the AF Form 8/8a until
         requisites are complete and enter the requisites on the recheck AF Form 8/8a.
  5.2.8. Alternate Means of Evaluation. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not
  possible, the area may be evaluated verbally or in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD). Flight
  examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight before resorting to
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                    39


  this option. See the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, for areas prohibited from
  verbal/ATD evaluation.
  5.2.9. Evaluation Criteria Source. The MAJCOM designated as lead command in AFPD
  10-9, in coordination with other user commands, will establish and maintain standardized
  INSTM, INSTR, MSN and QUAL evaluation criteria in the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-
  Specific Volume 2. The lead command is responsible for coordinating the establishment of:
     5.2.9.1. Areas/subareas to be used for documenting required evaluations including those
     required and critical for evaluation completion. These areas/subareas will be arranged
     into general and specific evaluation areas. Where required, mission areas/subareas will be
     further subdivided into general and specific mission areas.
     5.2.9.2. An area containing criteria for Publications Check. This is required for QUAL
     evaluations and may be accomplished on other evaluations.
         5.2.9.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for required flight publications as
         outlined in applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific series publications.
         5.2.9.2.2. Satisfactory performance requires individual flight publications be current
         and properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew
         members are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications
         required for the mission.
     5.2.9.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM) evaluation criteria in the
     appropriate areas/subareas. Use AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management
     Training Program, and MAJCOM supplements (as applicable).
     5.2.9.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules
     and procedures. Must specifically ensure compliance with minimum safe maneuvering
     speeds below 10,000 ft MSL and NAS awareness in all areas of mission planning and
     flight operations.
  5.2.10. Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document
  aircrew performance. On one level, individual scores are recorded for examinations while
  areas/subareas of aircrew performance are individually graded against established evaluation
  criteria. Performance less than fully qualified is documented. On the second level, an overall
  qualification level is determined from the compilation of these individual scores/grades.
     5.2.10.1. Area/Subarea Grades. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 will establish
     areas and subareas to be evaluated during emergency procedure and other evaluations - to
     include the appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas/subareas will have
     a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be
     documented against the listed subareas.
         5.2.10.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a
         satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within
         the prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
         5.2.10.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned
         area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the
         flight examiner. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the
         prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
40    AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


        5.2.10.1.3. U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable
        parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely
        affected mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee
        receiving an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in
        the judgment of the flight examiner, additional training will not constructively
        improve examineeâ€™s performance, it is not required. In this case, the flight examiner
        must thoroughly debrief the examinee.
     5.2.10.2. Critical Area. The lead MAJCOM is responsible for the establishment of
     evaluation areas that, upon failure, would most adversely affect the qualification of an
     aircrew member. Critical areas include, but are not limited to, Airmanship, Flight
     Discipline and Safety. Grade all critical areas as either Qualified (Q) or Unqualified (U).
     5.2.10.3. Qualification Levels. EPEs and overall evaluation performance are graded by
     qualification levels as follows:
        5.2.10.3.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The aircrew member demonstrated desired
        performance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within
        tolerances specified in the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no
        discrepancies were noted, and may be awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
            5.2.10.3.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any
            area(s)/subarea(s).
            5.2.10.3.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies
            preclude awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1.
            5.2.10.3.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during
            the debrief of that evaluation.
        5.2.10.3.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The aircrew member demonstrated the
        ability to perform duties safely, but:
            5.2.10.3.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training
            was assigned.
            5.2.10.3.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
            5.2.10.3.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on
            performance in one or several areas/subareas.
        5.2.10.3.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The aircrew member demonstrated an
        unacceptable level of safety, performance or knowledge.
            5.2.10.3.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q-3
            for the evaluation.
            5.2.10.3.3.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight
            examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several
            areas/subareas.
     5.2.10.4. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs examinations as either Qualified (Q)
     or Unqualified (U).
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                 41


     5.2.10.5. Written, Computer Based, or Electronic Examinations. Grade written,
     computer based, or electronic examinations as a percentage of correct answers. See
     paragraph 6.4.4.1 for minimum passing grade criteria.
  5.2.11. Grading Policies.
     5.2.11.1. Requisite Examinations. The flight examiner will consider performance on
     requisite examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
     5.2.11.2. Performance Areas/Subareas. Use the two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-
     /U) grading system when applying the grading criteria definitions specified in the
     applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, to grade areas/subareas.
         5.2.11.2.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as â€•requiredâ€– in
         the general and specific evaluation sections of the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
         Volume 2.
         5.2.11.2.2. The flight examiner will grade any area/subarea observed during an
         evaluation if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation
         accomplished or flight safety.
         5.2.11.2.3. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft
         conditions.
         5.2.11.2.4. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are
         acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such
         deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations when
         determining the overall area/subarea grade.
         5.2.11.2.5. The flight examiner may further identify an area/sub-area as
         â€•Commendableâ€– if, in the examinerâ€™s determination, the aircrew member has
         demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in that particular area/sub-area.
         Document commendable areas in the examinerâ€™s remarks section of the AF Form
         8/8a.
     5.2.11.3. Overall Qualification Levels.
         5.2.11.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded on an evaluation is based on
         performance during both the flight and ground phases. An overall grade of Q-1 or Q-
         2 will be awarded only after all evaluation requirements have been completed and
         given due consideration. An overall grade of Q-3 may be awarded at any time.
         5.2.11.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must
         satisfy the criteria set forth in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2, and
         demonstrate ability to operate the aircraft and/or equipment safely and effectively
         during all phases of an evaluation.
         5.2.11.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. While AFI 11-2
         MDS Specific Volume 2 guidance may dictate the highest grade for a flight or EPE
         based on area and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will always be the
         determining factor in deciding the overall qualification level.
         5.2.11.3.4. (Added-SJAFB) After a flight evaluation, if the Flight Examiner has
         determined that an overall grade of Q-2 or Q-3 will be awarded, notification of the
42     AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


         commander, operations officer or operations supervisor is required prior to debrief. If
         during the debrief it appears that the examinee may receive a Q-2 or Q-3, the Flight
         Examiner will cease debriefing to inform the commander, operations officer or
         operations supervisor.
     5.2.11.4. Exceptionally Qualified Designation. An exceptionally qualified designation
     may be awarded by the flight examiner. The designation can only be applied to the total
     evaluation - not to separate requisites. The designation may be awarded when:
         5.2.11.4.1. The aircrew member has demonstrated exceptional skill and knowledge in
         all phases of the evaluation;
         5.2.11.4.2. The aircrew member has not failed any requisite and;
         5.2.11.4.3. The aircrew member received a qualified grade with no remedial action
         on all areas/subareas evaluated during emergency procedures and flight evaluations.
  5.2.12. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy
  and/or deficiency in performance. Remedial action includes debriefing discrepancies and/or
  assignment of additional training. See paragraph 5.2.13 when discrepancies result in failure
  to pass a flight evaluation.
     5.2.12.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
     evaluation wherein the flight examiner provides briefing/instruction concerning the
     discrepancy and determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or
     proficiency to remedy the discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is
     annotated with â€•Debriefedâ€– in paragraph B of the Examinerâ€™s Remarks section of the AF
     Form 8/8a Comments.
     5.2.12.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by a flight examiner to
     remedy deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
     5.2.12.2. (ACC) Units will outline procedures for ensuring additional training is
     accomplished in the unit supplement to this volume.
         5.2.12.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, ground instruction, use of a
         simulator or flying. To complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate
         attainment of satisfactory knowledge or proficiency.
             5.2.12.2.1.1. (Added-SJAFB) On evaluations requiring additional training,
             DOV will complete the letter in Attachment 15 of this document and forward a
             copy to 4 OG/OGV. The letter will be maintained in the individualâ€™s FEF until
             completion of the Form 8.
         5.2.12.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Examinerâ€™s Remarks in the AF Form 8/8a Comments
         section. Description of assigned additional training will include how satisfactory
         knowledge or proficiency will be demonstrated to a flight examiner or instructor.
         5.2.12.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be
         documented in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8/8a (see paragraphs 7.3.5.5
         and 7.4.5.5).
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                   43


         5.2.12.2.4. The flight examiner or instructor who completed the additional training
         will sign as the Certifying Official under Additional Training, Section II, verifying
         completion of all assigned training as documented in paragraph C, Recommended
         Additional Training, under Examinerâ€™s Remarks.
         5.2.12.2.5. Commanders will ensure required additional training is completed.
         Accomplish additional training by the last day of the third month following the date
         of the discrepancy, e.g., for an evaluation on 21 Jan 06, additional training must be
         accomplished by 30 Apr 06. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for
         completion of additional training, the squadron commander will review the situation
         and direct appropriate action. Document the circumstances with an MFR placed in
         Section II of the FEF of the affected individual. Incorporate the information contained
         in the MFR onto the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D,
         Additional Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFRs from the FEF.
         Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF only when the Major
         discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
  5.2.13. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation.
     5.2.13.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful flight or
     ground recheck must be completed by the end of the third month after the date of the first
     failure, e.g. for an evaluation on 20 Jun 07, complete the recheck by 30 Sep 07. A
     recheck is successfully completed when the aircrew member performs to Q criteria (Q or
     Q-/debriefed) for each area graded U. OG/CCs may approve waivers to the time limits in
     this paragraph on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in
     Section II of the FEF. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
     AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when
     action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a
     permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not
     addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a. Every reasonable effort must be made to
     requalify the individual. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed
     during this period, based on the individualâ€™s experience level, present qualifications and
     hours of training required. The flight examiner that administered the original check will
     not normally administer the recheck.
     5.2.13.2. Status Downgrade. Downgrade aircrew members receiving a Q-3 INSTM,
     QUAL or MSN evaluation to non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-
     CMR), non-basic mission capable (N-BMC), or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ)
     status, as applicable. For instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC)
     need not be downgraded if the discrepancies were only in instructor areas.
  5.2.14. Restrictions. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the
  judgment of the flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until
  successful completion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
     5.2.14.1. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
     requires supervision and the criteria for removal of the restrictions.
         5.2.14.1.1. Substandard performance in any area/subarea may require restrictions to
         ensure operational safety or mission accomplishment.
44     AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


         5.2.14.1.2. If defined in the MDS specific Volume 1 and/or Volume 2, formal
         schoolhouses will include restrictions on the AF Forms 8 for any core item not
         accomplished due to training limimitations, regardless if the method of qualification
         is by evaluation or instructor certification. Under no circumstance will aircrew
         perform core items in which they are not qualified unless under the direct supervision
         of an instructor. In this case, MDS specific guidance will set the time requirement for
         completion of additional training.
     5.2.14.2. Specific restrictions and the criteria for the removal of the restrictions will be
     documented as the first item of the AF Form 8/8a Comments. Restrictions associated
     with failed requisite examinations will not be documented on the AF Form 8/8a.
     5.2.14.3. Restrict aircrew receiving a Q-3 on an evaluation until a successful evaluation
     is completed:
         5.2.14.3.1. For QUAL evaluations, place the examinee on supervised status in the
         aircraft in which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the
         evaluator, the discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft. For specialized
         qualified, universally qualified, or multiple qualified aircrew maintaining
         qualification for similar duty in multiple aircraft, AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2
         may direct supervised status in all aircraft in which the individual maintains
         qualification.
         5.2.14.3.2. For INSTM evaluations, restrictions apply to all aircraft in which the
         examinee is required to maintain instrument qualification.
         5.2.14.3.3. MSN       Evaluation.    The      examinee      may      perform    basic
         qualification/instrument tasks unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on
         supervised status for mission tasks.
         5.2.14.3.4. INSTR Evaluation. Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any
         instructor area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is
         completed.
  5.2.15. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance or restriction requires the aircrew
  member be placed on supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated
  supervisor) will be determined by the squadron commander (or equivalent) and as specified
  in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1. Supervision will be accomplished by instructors or
  designated supervisors (as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 1) qualified in the
  specific aircrew position.
  5.2.16. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew
  member fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the
  eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in
  paragraph 5.2.7.2 for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, the aircrew member loses
  the qualification covered by the evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.2.14.3 apply.
  Qualification may be re-established by administering a requalification evaluation (see
  paragraph 5.2.3.2) or by completion of the delinquent evaluation. OG/CCs may approve
  waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites to complete the
  evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with an MFR placed in Section II
  of the FEF. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected AF Form
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                      45


  8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when action is complete,
  and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a permanent part of the FEF
  only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed or corrected by a
  later Form 8/8a.
  5.2.17. Multiple Qualification. Multiple qualification guidance applies to aircrew members
  who maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft. When differences
  between series aircraft in the same MDS are great enough, the lead MAJCOM, in
  coordination with using MAJCOMs, will identify requirements for separate qualification
  requirements. When separate qualification is not required, document certification in different
  MDS series using AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training, or AF Form
  4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification
  document signed by an authorized official (such as a Letter of Xâ€™s).
     5.2.17.1. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification,
     including a list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained, in an MFR placed in
     Section II of the FEF. (For Air Force Materiel Command [AFMC], MAJCOM authority
     may be delegated, but not lower than wing commander.) See AFI 11-202, Volume 1, for
     additional guidance.
     5.2.17.2. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to
     include requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified
     by the authorizing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are
     directed by the MAJCOM in its supplement to this instruction.
     5.2.17.2. (ACC) Aircrew members will accomplish the instrument evaluation in their
     primary aircraft. EXCEPTION: U-2 aircrew members will accomplish the instrument
     evaluation as outlined in AFI 11-2U-2V2, U-2--Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
     5.2.17.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL
     evaluation, and, if applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each mission
     design series aircraft according to applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2. When
     specified IAW paragraph 5.2.17, QUAL and MSN evaluations are required for different
     series aircraft in the same MDS.
     5.2.17.4. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q-3 on an INSTM evaluation results
     in a downgrade in all aircraft flown in which instrument qualification is required. A
     downgrade resulting from a Q-3 in QUAL or MSN evaluation applies only to the aircraft
     for which the evaluation was administered, unless, in the opinion of the evaluator, the
     discrepancy is applicable to additional aircraft.
  5.2.18. Universal Qualification. Universal qualification guidance applies to specialized
  aircrew who maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft where
  qualification is attained/maintained via a minimum of a ground phase examination.
  MAJCOMs may require a flight phase evaluation. AE crewmembers require a ground and
  flight phase evaluation, IAW AFI 11-2AE, Volume 2. The flight phase evaluation, when
  required, may be accomplished on any of the aircraft in which the aircrew member is either
  gaining or maintaining qualification, and will update qualification on all aircraft listed on the
  specialized aircrew memberâ€™s Aeronautical Order (AO). MAJCOMs may specify additional
  ground phase requisites.
 46     AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


      5.2.18.1. Applicability. Specialized aircrew may gain/maintain aircraft qualification
      IAW Universal Qualification guidance. MAJCOMs will identify Universal Qualified
      crewmember eligibility in the MAJCOM supplement to this AFI.
          5.2.18.1.1. (Added-ACC) The following specialized aircrew are authorized to
          maintain qualification in two or more mission design series aircraft IAW Universal
          Qualification guidance: Flight Surgeons, Combat Rescue Officers, Pararescuemen,
          Aerial Still Photographers, and Aerial Broadcasters.
      5.2.18.2. Documentation. Specialized aircrew qualifications maintained under
      Universal qualification guidance will be documented on an AF Form 8a, IAW
      paragraph 7.4 AECM qualification will be documented using AF Form 8, IAW
      paragraph 7.3 Flight surgeon qualification may be documented using either AF Form 8
      or AF Form 8a, IAW paragraph 8.2.8 or paragraph 8.2.9.
      5.2.18.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew qualifications
      maintained under Universal Qualification guidance are considered a QUAL evaluation. A
      MSN evaluation may be directed by applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2
      and/or MAJCOM supplement to this Instruction. MSN evaluations, when required, will
      include a flight phase evaluation in one MDS that the Specialized Aircrew member
      maintains qualification.
      5.2.18.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite/Flight Evaluation. Failure of universally
      qualified aircrew members to pass a ground requisite or flight phase evaluation results in
      loss of applicable aircraft qualification, IAW MAJCOM supplement and AFI 11-2 MDS-
      Specific Volumes 2.
   5.2.19. Aircrews Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force
   Units. Aircrew members authorized to perform duties in non-US Air Force aircraft IAW
   AFI 11-401, or on duty with or attached to non-US Air Force units for flying, abide by host
   service or host country guidance, except for the requirement to maintain a current physical
   and review their flight records according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1. They do not necessarily
   abide by USAF guidance, including AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
   Volume 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF units, they must complete applicable
   requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF evaluations that expired during their tour.
   The restrictions in paragraph 5.2.14 of this instruction apply to such individuals until
   successful evaluations are completed.
      1.MAJCOMs may approve exceptions to requirements for returning aircrew members to
         complete applicable requisites and expired USAF evaluations, if, after case-by-case
         review, they determine non-USAF evaluations are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2
         MDS-Specific Volume 2 evaluations. Document such action with an MFR placed in
         Section II of the FEF on top of the non-USAF AF Form 8 equivalent.
      2.Air Force units that use non-US Air Force aircraft to execute an Air Force flying
         program will comply with current Air Force guidance, unless excepted by proper
         authority. See AFI 11-401 for definitions of Air Force and US Government aircraft.
5.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluations.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                  47


   5.3.1. Scope. Evaluate an aircrew memberâ€™s knowledge of MDS-Specific EPs and systems
   knowledge for all QUAL evaluations; evaluate MSN specific emergency procedures and
   systems knowledge during MSN evaluations. Only one EPE needs to be accomplished for
   each combined evaluation (i.e., one EPE for a QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN
   evaluation). A single EPE may be used for separate evaluations (e.g. a MSN and
   INSTM/QUAL eval). The combined EPE must be of a scope and duration to cover required
   areas and must be within the requisite zone for each evaluation.
   5.3.2. Satisfactory Performance. Satisfactory performance for EPEs requires taking the
   proper action in the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is
   responsible for the Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
   5.3.3. Content and Administration. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 will specify
   contents of EPEs, grading areas to be evaluated, grading criteria and whether EPEs may be
   done inflight, in an ATD, or verbally.
       5.3.3.1. (Added-SJAFB) MSN EPEs will use any of the OGV developed MSN EPE
       profiles in the MTC. FTU Instructor MSN EPEs may also simulate any student syllabus
       mission. Mission EPEs should be scheduled as a two-ship.
       5.3.3.2. (Added-SJAFB) INSTM/QUAL EPEs may utilize any database available in the
       MTC.
       5.3.3.3. (Added-SJAFB) If the MTC is not available, utilize the IATs located in the 4
       TS building. Table-top EPEs will be used as a last resort only.
   5.3.4. Grading. The flight examiner will assign an EPE grade 1, 2, or 3 (Qualification
   Level 1, 2, or 3) in the Qualification Ground Phase block of the AF Form 8/8a, regardless of
   whether all or a portion of the EPE was performed inflight.
   5.3.5. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight examiner
   will indicate if the additional training will be accomplished before next flight under
   restrictions in the Comments block of the AF Form 8/8a.
       5.3.5.1. (Added-SJAFB) Documentation of additional training will be IAW paragraph
       5.2.12.2.
   5.3.6. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP situation during
   an EPE requires an unqualified (3) EPE grade. An aircrew member who receives a 3 grade as
   a result of Boldface/CAPs error will not fly again until a successful reevaluation is
   accomplished.
   5.3.7. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an unqualified EPE grade (3) will be
   placed on supervised status until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
   5.3.8. (Added-ACC) Unusual attitude recovery procedures will be evaluated during all
   emergency procedures evaluations and will be defined in each AFI 11-2MDS Volume 2.
   5.3.9. (Added-ACC) EPE discrepancies will be recorded on ACC Form 8a or suitable
   alternate. These will be kept on file until the AF Form 8 is completed.
5.4. Supplementary Evaluations. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools used by
a commander to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to operational problems. These
evaluations are most often administered as inspections (using specifically prepared checklists)
 48     AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


where results are reported to the commander. The form and content of supplementary evaluations
is at the discretion of the commander.
   5.4.1. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
       5.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) Supplementary evaluations should examine the effectiveness of
       unit operational procedures and training programs. They may be used as an effective
       means of validating the effectiveness of evaluation trend corrective actions.
   5.4.2. Commanders will determine evaluated areas. The stan/eval function will determine the
   method of evaluation, is responsible for administrative management of data collection, and
   will report results as directed by the commander.
       5.4.2.1. (Added-SJAFB) OGV will forward supplemental evaluation recommendations
       to the OG/CC whenever any trend (in-flight or ground) is identified. OGV may also
       designate periodic supplemental evaluations IAW the continuity book maintained in
       OGV.
       5.4.2.2. (Added-SJAFB) Squadron DOV functions may conduct supplementary
       evaluations within their specific unit. When a squadron level Supp Eval is conducted,
       DOVs will inform OGV of the subject and results for consideration as a Group level
       Supp Eval.
   5.4.3. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the OG/CC, may conduct
   supplementary evaluations.
   5.4.4. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight
   evaluation. If conducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations should not be all-
   encompassing, nor result in the assignment of an overall rating for any specific aircrew
   member, nor be documented on an AF Form 8/8a.
   5.4.5. Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                   49


                                          Chapter 6

                         AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The aircrew examination program measures aircrew member knowledge of
normal/emergency procedures, threats, and other information essential for the safe and effective
operation of their assigned weapon system through the administration of written, computer-based
or electronic examinations. Poor testing performance on examinations indicates areas requiring
increased training emphasis.
6.2. Scope. This chapter applies to rated (pilots, navigators, and air battle managers), career
enlisted aviator (CEA), and non-rated X-prefix AE aircrew. For Flight Surgeons (rated) and non-
rated aircrew (K-, Q-, or other X-prefix Air Force Specialty Code), see Chapter 8. The
examination program in this chapter includes requisite examinations for periodic evaluations and
unit periodic examinations. Requisite examinations include qualification open book and closed
book examinations, instrument examinations and Boldface/CAPs examinations as described in
paragraph 5.2.4. The ability to focus on specific knowledge areas is enhanced by the
management of examination content and use of appropriate master question files.
6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will describe the unit aircrew examination program
   in the unit supplement to this instruction.
   6.3.1. (ACC) ACC units will use the Patriot Excalibur (PEX) Stan/Eval module for program
   management.
   6.3.2. Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Computer based or electronic
   information management tools may fulfill the requirement for examinations as outlined in
   this instruction.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. The stan/eval function will retain graded exam
   answer sheets/computer records until the AF Form 8/8a is completed.
   6.3.4. Examination Question Review. The stan/eval function will review all MQFs, secure
   question banks, and prepared exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in source
   documents. If a complete review was accomplished due to a source document change it may
   be annotated as the annual review. Units will document their procedures for reviewing and
   updating MQFs and prepared exams in their unit supplement to this instruction.
       6.3.4.1. (Added-SJAFB) OGV will review MQFs and SQBs during December of each
       year, or whenever Technical Order or MQF changes are distributed.
   6.3.5. End-of-Course Examinations. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses
   listed in the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) database
   (https://etca.randolph.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) examinations to fulfill the
   requirements of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite
   examinations.
       6.3.5.1. The stan/eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate
       with the MDS lead command to ensure the EOC examination meets the requirements of
 50     AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


      this instruction and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2 before awarding credit for
      requisite completion.
      6.3.5.2. EOC examination test questions do not need to incorporate MAJCOM MQFs.
      All questions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures
      and not conflict with any MQFs.
      6.3.5.3. All EOC examinations that fulfill the requirements of requisite examinations will
      be graded according to paragraph 6.4.4.1 and entered on the AF Form 8 according to
      paragraph 7.3.5.1.
6.4. Requisite Examinations. Aircrew members will complete open book, closed book and
Boldface/CAPs examinations (if applicable) as requisites for periodic QUAL evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.1), instrument examination as requisite for periodic INSTM evaluations (see
paragraph 5.2.4.2), and any other examinations required by the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-
Specific Volume 2 (see paragraph 5.2.4.3).
   6.4.1. Requisite Examination Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs
   examinations, maintain either requisite examinations for each crew position or generate a
   unique test for each aircrew member requiring an exam.
      6.4.1.1. If requisite examinations are maintained for each crew position:
          6.4.1.1.1. Units are required to develop and control a minimum of two requisite
          examinations for each crew position.
          6.4.1.1.2. Units having ten or fewer members per crew position require only one
          examination.
          6.4.1.1.3. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information,
          units are not required to maintain separate examinations for each crew position.
          6.4.1.1.4. Change a minimum of 50 percent of the questions on requisite
          examinations each calendar year.
      6.4.1.2. If a unique test is generated for each aircrew member requiring an exam:
          6.4.1.2.1. Units may use MAJCOM-approved software for test creation.
             6.4.1.2.1.1. (Added-SJAFB) OGV will use Patriot Excalibur (PEX) software to
             generate Open and Closed Book tests. OGV members will review the test before
             it is approved for use in PEX.
             6.4.1.2.1.2. (Added-SJAFB) OGV will produce two versions each of the Closed
             and Open Book tests (version A as the primary, version B for re-examinations
             following failures). Additionally, OGV will produce two versions each of the
             Closed and Open Book tests specific to FTU students.
             6.4.1.2.1.3. (Added-SJAFB) FTU student Academic Tests will not count as
             QUAL evaluation requisites.
             6.4.1.2.1.4. (Added-SJAFB) Permanent Party Aircrew will test at OGV using
             PEX generated tests to the maximum extent possible.
             6.4.1.2.1.5. (Added-SJAFB) FTU students will test using paper copies of the
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                  51


            Open and Closed book tests supplied by OGV to the DOV shop of the FTU
            squadron. DOV shops will maintain security of the paper copy of the FTU Open
            and Closed book A and B tests. DOV will grade all FTU tests and record test
            results in PEX for Form 8 processing.
            6.4.1.2.1.6. (Added-SJAFB) FTU DOV will use student test results data for
            FTU trend analysis.
         6.4.1.2.2. Requisite exam databases will contain a sufficient number of questions to
         ensure a probability of no more than 50 percent duplication of questions for each test
         generated.
  6.4.2. Examination Security. Stan/eval personnel will maintain positive control of all
  requisite exams, applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media.
  EXCEPTION: Requisite Open-book Flight Surgeon examination will be maintained by
  AFMOA/SG3P.
     6.4.2.1. (Added-SJAFB) An OGV member will be present to proctor tests administered
     via PEX. Test-specific computers will be made available for examinees to utilize in the
     OGV office. When no member of OGV is present, the office will be locked.
  6.4.3. Grading Policy For Examinations.
     6.4.3.1. Minimum Passing Grade. The minimum passing grade for Boldface/CAPs
     exams is 100 percent. The minimum passing grade for all other stan/eval requisite
     examinations is 85 percent - corrected to 100 percent.
     6.4.3.2. Requisite and Boldface/CAPs Examination Grading Restriction. Units will
     grade all completed requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew memberâ€™s
     next flight. In the unit supplement to this instruction describe how this restriction is
     enforced.
         6.4.3.2.1. (Added-SJAFB) PEX software assigns a grade immediately upon
         completion of the requisite exam. If a paper copy of the examination is administered,
         the OGV member proctoring the exam will grade it immediately upon completion.
         6.4.3.2.2. (Added-SJAFB) Paper copies of test answer sheets may be destroyed
         once the test data has been entered into PEX.
  6.4.4. Examination Question Sources.
     6.4.4.1. Open Book Requisite Exam. Open book questions will come from
     publications containing information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and
     performance of the assigned mission. The open book subject areas and the publications
     used to generate the exam will be made available to aircrew. Each unit may develop an
     open book secure question bank (SQB) that serves as the source for some or all of the
     open book examination questions. Do not distribute the SQB to unit aircrews and
     safeguard it in the same manner as any other required stan/eval examination. Electronic
     publications may be used for open book examinations.
         6.4.4.1.1. (Added-ACC) The emphasis of open book exams is on technical orders,
         manuals, handbooks or instructions that may not require immediate recall or are not
         regularly referenced.
52    AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


        6.4.4.1.2. (Added-ACC) Each unit will develop a Secure Question Bank (SQB).
        6.4.4.1.3. (Added-ACC) Do not select open book questions from any closed book
        MQF.
        6.4.4.1.4. (Added-SJAFB) Open Book examination question sources are T.O. 1F-
        15E-1, 1F-15E-1-1, 1F-15E-34-1-1, 1F-15E-34-1-2, 1-1M-34, AFI 11-214 and AFI
        11-2F-15EV3I.
     6.4.4.2. Closed Book Requisite Exams. Closed book questions will come from MQFs.
     These questions will emphasize system knowledge and information necessary for safe
     flight and mission accomplishment.
     6.4.4.2. (ACC) Major emphasis of closed book requisite exams will be on aircraft
     systems and mission knowledge that the aircrews must immediately recall while airborne
     and key information from publications not available in-flight.
        6.4.4.2.1. MDS-Specific MQFs. Lead command MAJCOMs will ensure MDS-
        Specific MQFs containing approved questions for closed book testing are available
        for MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable aircrew.
            6.4.4.2.1.1. The highest organization with a stan/eval function (NAF or unit) may
            develop, maintain and publish MQFs for weapons systems without MAJCOM
            expertise. That organization will submit these MQFs to the MAJCOM for
            approval prior to their publication.
            6.4.4.2.1.2. MAJCOM OPRs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes
            to MQFs as necessary.
               6.4.4.2.1.2.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures,
               administrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational
               procedures; however, subject matter may not be changed.
               6.4.4.2.1.2.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate
               MAJCOM.
        6.4.4.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local
        procedures MQF databank to augment HHQ MQFs.
            6.4.4.2.2.1. (Added-ACC) Local Procedures MQFs may be used to supplement
            the MAJCOM approved MQF. Units may include any information necessary for
            safe flight and mission accomplishment not included in the MAJCOM MQF.
            Local instructions, range procedures, unit supplements to AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
            Volumes 3, are examples of sources for the Local Procedures MQF.
               6.4.4.2.2.1.1. (Added-SJAFB) OGV will review/update the Local
               Procedures MQF during December of each year, or when any local
               regulation/instruction change is released.
            6.4.4.2.2.2. (Added-ACC) Units will develop and distribute a local procedures
            MQF for all flight aircrew members. At least 10 percent of closed book
            examination questions will come from the local procedures MQF.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                   53


     6.4.4.3. Instrument Requisite Exams. Instrument test questions come from the
     Instrument MQF maintained by the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA). The
     selection and content of the questions is dictated by the provisions of AFMAN 11-210.
        6.4.4.3.1. (Added-SJAFB) 4 OG/OGV delegates management of the Instrument
        Refresher Course and testing to Boeing Aerospace. Boeing Aerospace will review
        the Instrument test annually, and OGV will review and approve the test. OGV will
        maintain copies of the current exams. Boeing will provide semi-annual trend
        information for inclusion in the SEB.
  6.4.5. Boldface/CAPs Requisite Examinations.
     6.4.5.1. Aircrew member knowledge of applicable Boldface/CAPs will be evaluated
     through a written examination as a requisite to all periodic QUAL evaluations.
     6.4.5.2. Satisfactory performance for the Boldface/CAPs examination requires writing
     the proper actions in the correct sequence, not necessarily a verbatim response. The flight
     examiner will assign a Boldface/CAPs grade (Q or U) in the Qualification Ground Phase
     block of the AF Form 8/8a.
     6.4.5.3. (Added-ACC) Boldface/CAPs exam will be written from memory.
     Abbreviations which do not affect the correct meaning of the procedure are acceptable.
  6.4.6. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. An evaluation will not be complete until all
  failed items have been successfully re-accomplished.
     6.4.6.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination at
     any time must be afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other
     than Boldface/CAPs, the aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
        6.4.6.1.1. (Added-SJAFB) When an individual fails a requisite exam, OGV will
        immediately notify the individualâ€™s operations officer and DOV chief. DOV will
        complete an Unsatisfactory Testing Performance Letter (Attachment 14). The letter
        will be forwarded to the unit DOV for inclusion in the individualâ€™s FEF until the
        Form 8 is completed.
            6.4.6.1.1.1. (Added-SJAFB) Version B of the appropriate requisite exam will be
            administered for re-examinations.
     6.4.6.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite examination
     must complete a successful reexamination by the end of the third month following the
     date of the first failure, or the end of their eligibility period, whichever occurs first.
     Waiver authority to extend the time allowed to successfully complete the examination is
     the OG/CC. Document such waivers with an MFR placed in Section II of the FEF of the
     affected individual. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto the affected
     AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks, paragraph D, Additional Comments, when
     action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Memos for record become a
     permanent part of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not
     addressed or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
     6.4.6.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a
     Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful reexamination is
     accomplished.
 54      AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


       6.4.6.4. Supervised Status Requirement. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite
       open book, closed book, or instrument examination in supervised status until successful
       retesting is completed. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications,
       supervised status resulting from failure of either an open or closed book examination
       applies only to the aircraft for which the examination was administered. Failure of a
       requisite instrument exam results in the examinee being placed in supervised status in all
       aircraft in which instrument qualification is required.
6.5. Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). Each group/squadron stan/eval function may
conduct periodic testing for all aircrew. The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional
knowledge beyond the scope of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge,
tactical/threat knowledge, and/or operational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge
deficiencies exist within the unit. This exam may be open or closed book, but will not count as a
requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy the requirement for a periodic exam. Units will
describe this program in the unit supplement to this instruction, to include procedures for failed
exams.
   6.5.1. (Added-ACC) Each unit will conduct periodic testing at least semiannually for all
   aircrew members. Periodic tests are intended to encourage aircrew review of operationally
   relevant topics selected by the OG/CC. The OG/CC will determine whether the test is
   administered open or closed book and whether proctoring is required. A majority of the
   questions must come from sources other than MAJCOM-approved MQFs (i.e. flight
   manuals, Instructions, SPINS, etc). Classified tests will be handled appropriately. Flight
   Surgeons and non-rated/non-CEA aircrew members are exempted.
       6.5.1.1. (Added-SJAFB) OGV will produce and review the periodic test semi-annually.
       The test will be distributed to the squadrons by 1 June and 1 December.
       6.5.1.2. (Added-SJAFB) The intent of the Periodic exam is to determine trends in
       knowledge deficiency. Minimum passing score is 85%, corrected to 100%.
       6.5.1.3. (Added-SJAFB) Squadron DOVs will administer the periodic exam and
       forward un-corrected answer sheets to OGV for trending information. Group trend data
       will be presented at the SEB, and will be used as a foundation for supplemental
       evaluation recommendations to the OG/CC.
       6.5.1.4. (Added-SJAFB) The periodic test is a Go/No-Go item at the beginning of each
       half. Aircrew will be grounded until completion of the periodic exam in a new half.
       New aircrew who arrive during a half need not take the exam prior to flying.
       6.5.1.5. (Added-SJAFB) Questions for the periodic exam will include recent
       suite/publication changes, recent supplementary evaluation topics, FCIFs, SIIs, T.O. 1F-
       15E-1, T.O. 1F-15E-34-1-1, T.O. 1F-15E-34-1-2, AFI 11-202V3, and AFI 11-2F-
       15EV3I.
   6.5.2. (Added-ACC) All units will establish a Boldface/Critical Action Procedure written
   examination program for all applicable crew positions. As a minimum, all applicable aircrew
   members will successfully complete a Boldface/Critical Action Procedure written
   examination prior to the first flight of each month. The examination will be taken in the
   period for which it is applicable. Failure of this written exam grounds the individual until a
   successful examination is accomplished.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                    55


       6.5.2.1. (Added-ACC) A Boldface/Critical Action Procedure written examination will
       be accomplished for each MDS for which the aircrew is qualified (if any portion of the
       Boldface/CAPs is different from the primary aircraft).
       6.5.2.2. (Added-ACC) Boldface/Critical Action Procedure written examinations will be
       graded by the squadron operations supervisor or designated representative IAW
       paragraph 6.4.5.3. of this supplement. Failure of this written exam grounds the individual
       until a successful examination is accomplished.
6.6. (Added-SJAFB) Flight Examiner Test. OGV will develop and administer a Flight
Examiner test as part of the Flight Examiner upgrade program. This exam will be administered
via PEX as an open book examination, and will draw questions from AFI 11-202V2I, AFI 11-
2F-15EV2I, and the 4 OG Flight Examiner Guide. The minimum passing score will be 85%
corrected to 100%. This exam will be updated during December of each year, or when
applicable regulation changes are released.

                                            Chapter 7

                                     DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate
documentation. The qualifications and authorizations for which an aircrew member is to be
evaluated are determined from the unit certification document. The results of aircrew evaluations
are recorded on the AF Form 8 or AF Form 8a, which certifies the qualification of the aircrew
member. The chronological history of evaluations for an aircrew member is recorded on an AF
Form 942, Record of Evaluation. These AF forms are maintained in the FEF for the aircrew
member. EXCEPTION: Not required for cadets participating in USAFA airmanship programs.
7.2. Qualifications and Certifications. Aircrew qualifications are attained through evaluations
and documented on the AF Form 8 or the AF Form 8a, as applicable. Aircrew certifications
attained through methods other than evaluation (instructor-certified events and commander
certifications for example) may be documented on an AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air
Crew Training, or AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. As an alternative to use of AF
Form 1381 or AF Form 4348, MAJCOMs may approve use of a unit certification document
signed by an authorized official.
7.2. (ACC)Qualifications and Certifications. Changes to the qualifications/certifications which
occur prior to the printing of a new ARMS product will be annotated and initialed by the
certifying official. Units that do not have access to an ARMS product containing the required
information will use a single letter indicating unit aircrew qualifications/aircrew certifications.
These letters/ARMS products will be certified and maintained either in the FEF or in a suitable
location. When FEFs are carried TDY, a copy of this certified letter/product will be included. A
certified letter/product will be included in the individual's FEF going PCS or PCA.
EXCEPTION: AFRC units may use AF Form 4348 to document Aircrew Certifications in lieu
of certified letter/ARMs product.
7.3. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8 to record aircrew qualification. Certification of an AF
   Form 8 is accomplished by four individuals, beginning with the Flight Examiner, who
   completes the evaluation by signing the AF Form 8. Next, the Reviewing Officer and Final
   Approving Officer review the contents, the flight examinerâ€™s overall assessment, ensure all
   required additional training was adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete,
   and sign the AF Form 8. The final signature is provided by the examinee, who will sign the
   completed AF Form 8. EXCEPTION: For a Commander-Directed Downgrade AF Form 8,
   only the commander signs as the Final Approving Officer. See paragraph 7.4.8.
       7.3.1.1. Use a separate AF Form 8 for all flight phase rechecks.
       7.3.1.2. Ground rechecks will be completed on the original Q-3 AF Form 8 (see
       paragraph 7.3.9).
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 8.
   See Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8.
       7.3.2.1. For date fields in the AF Form 8 use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-
       digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by the form.

     7.3.2.2. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification will use a three-letter
     month and two-digit year format. For electronic forms, use the date format required by
     the form.
     7.3.2.3. Except for the organization of the Comments block described in paragraph
     7.3.7, sample AF Forms 8 are provided to demonstrate the content, not the format, of the
     data presented (see Attachment 3).
     7.3.2.4. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except where specifically noted
     otherwise, use upper and lower case letters.
     7.3.2.5. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification
     (right, left or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct
     specific format standards for such data entry.
     7.3.2.5. (ACC) Units may use the standard format established on the PEX Stan/Eval
     module Form 8 format.
     7.3.2.5. (SJAFB) Forms 8 will be produced utilizing PEX software.
  7.3.3. Date Completed.

8a is optional for aircrew maintaining qualification in multiple aircraft and/or multiple series
qualification in the same MDS. See Attachment 4 for sample AF Forms 8a.
   7.4.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8a to record aircrew qualification in multiple aircraft as
   demonstrated in required ground and flight evaluations. Certification of an AF Form 8a is
   accomplished by four individuals, beginning with the Flight Examiner, who completes the
   evaluation by signing the AF Form 8a. Next, the Reviewing Officer and Final Approving
   Officer review the contents, the flight examinerâ€™s overall assessment, ensure all required
   additional training was adequate to correct the noted deficiencies and is complete, and sign
   the AF Form 8a. The final signature is provided by the examinee, who will sign the
   completed AF Form 8a. Certification will not occur until all requisites of all aircraft for
   which the aircrew member possesses an aircraft AO are complete. EXCEPTIONS: Flight
   Surgeons and non-rated aircrew with only a ground phase examination do not require a
   Reviewing Officerâ€™s signature, IAW paragraph 7.4.6.2. For a Commander-Directed
   Downgrade AF Form 8a, only the commander signs as the Final Approving Officer. See

created training folder trackers. EXCEPTION: A FRC units will not document aircrew
certifications on AF Form 1381. FE certifications will be signed by the SQ/CC or OG/CC.
   7.6.1. Purpose. The AF Form 1381 provides a permanent record/certification source for
   aircrew certifications not attained through an AF Form 8/8a qualification. (MAJCOMs may
   approve use of a unit certification document signed by an authorized official. An authorized
   official for a unit certification document will be an official authorized to approve an AF
   Form 8 or 8a, or another appropriate authority designated in writing by this official.)
      7.6.1.1. Maintain a separate AF Form 1381 in the FEF, Section I, documenting
      certifications by individual assigned flying unit and primary MDS. For aircrew members
      with multiple aircraft certifications attained through difference training, only one AF
      Form 1381 is required; specify the primary mission MDS designation. File AF Forms
      1381 in chronological order with the most recent on top. Note: May also be filed in an
      aircrew memberâ€™s permanent training folder, as a training completion document. When
      AF Form 1381 is used as a training completion document, refer to AFI 11-202, Volume
      1, for guidance.
      7.6.1.2. Unit stan/eval will document all initial, downgrade and re-certifications for
      aircrew assigned/attached to their flying unit to indicate a chronological history of
      certifications of aircrew while assigned/attached to their flying unit.
          7.6.1.2.1. The AF Form 1381 will document all certifications attained in previous
          and current MDS(s). Retain as a historical source document. File AF Forms 1381 in
          chronological order with the most recent on top.
          7.6.1.2.2. During the initial review of individual FEF, also review AF Form 1381
          entries in the aircrew memberâ€™s training folder to determine applicable certifications
          of new assigned/attached aircrew members. Document aircrew certifications as
          specified by the assigned/attached flying unit commander on a new AF Form 1381.
              7.6.1.2.2.1. The OGV/DOV Chief or other individual designated by the squadron
              commander will sign a one line entry below all other entries signifying acceptance
              of those events listed above (see paragraph 7.6.7 for documentation
              requirements).
          7.6.1.2.3. AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement will specify AF Form 1381
          certifying officials, IAW paragraph 7.6.3.4.
      7.6.1.3. Do not use AF Form 1381 to document one-time training/new equipment unless
      directed by HHQ.
      7.6.1.4. Appropriate guidance that may require aircrew certification using AF Form 1381
      entry include AFI 11-202, Volume 2/MAJCOM Supplement; AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific

   forms as published on the Air Force e-Publishing web site. Electronic copies of the AF Form
   942 should be forwarded with the FEF when the individual moves to a new squadron. If
   electronic backups are normally maintained on removable storage media (e.g., DVD-
   ROM/CD-ROM, external hard drive, floppy disk) or are specifically prepared to facilitate
   transfer of an FEF, file the storage media in Section I of the FEF.
7.9. Flight Evaluation Folders The FEF contains the source documents that constitute the
history of flying qualification for each aircrew member. The AF Form 8/8a is the source
document used to record and certify the qualification of an aircrew member. A complete history
of the AF Forms 8/8a in an FEF is maintained on an accompanying AF Form 942.
   7.9.1. Maintenance. Each aircrew member who is on flying status must have a FEF, which
   includes all AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 1381/4348 (optional; see paragraphs
   7.2, 7.6), and additional MAJCOM specified items. EXCEPTION: See paragraph 8.4 for PJ
   and CRO evaluation folders.
       7.9.1.1. The FEF must be maintained by a stan/eval functional office - normally in the
       organization to which the individual is assigned or attached for flying.
       7.9.1.2. HHQ personnel on active flying status may have their FEFs maintained by the
       stan/eval function at their assigned stations.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                   87


     7.9.1.3. The FEF for personnel in inactive flying status will be maintained with their
     Flight Records Folder (FRF).
     7.9.1.4. FEF maintenance may be further defined in the MAJCOM supplement to this
     instruction.
     7.9.1.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of
     the service of the unit of attachment to document their history of
     qualification/certification.
  7.9.2. Contents of FEF. Divide the FEF into two sections:
     7.9.2.1. Section I (left side). This Section contains AF Forms 942, AF Forms
     1381/4348 (if used); see paragraph 7.2 for use of alternate documentation, MAJCOM
     required items and those items authorized by the unit supplement to this instruction (e.g.,
     logs of initial and annual reviews). Section I may contain two tabbed sub-sections, Tabs
     are optional.
         7.9.2.1.1. AF Forms 942 will be placed on top of Tab 1 this section (when tabs are
         used), in chronological order with the most recent on top. Place the AF Form
         1381/4348, if used (or alternate document) or any certifications, qualifications,
         authorizations, and/or cross-references to such documents.
         7.9.2.1.2. Tab 2 (if used) maintain any additional information as directed by
         MAJCOM supplement or paragraph 7.7.2.1.4.
         7.9.2.1.2. (ACC) Define additional Tab 2 information per unit supplement.
         7.9.2.1.3. If used, file backup electronic storage media in Section I of the FEF.
         7.9.2.1.4. If the FEF is not maintained at the same base with the individualâ€™s flight
         record, a copy of the most recent AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for
         Flying or Special Operational Duty, and AF Form 702, Individual Physiological
         Training Record, may be filed in this section behind Tab 2.
     7.9.2.2. Section II (right side). This Section contains AF Forms 8/8a and Memos for
     Record for all evaluations listed on the AF Form 942 in Section I.
         7.9.2.2.1. File AF Forms 8/8a in chronological order with the most recent on top.
         Individuals who maintain qualification in two or more mission design aircraft or two
         or more crew positions in the same mission design aircraft will file AF Forms 8/8a in
         chronological order â€“ without consideration of MDS or crew position.
         7.9.2.2.2. Memos for record documenting waivers and extensions are filed on top of
         the affected AF Form 8/8a. Incorporate the information contained in the MFR onto
         the affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner Remarks paragraph D, Additional
         Comments, when action is complete, and remove the MFR from the FEF. Permanent
         MFRs documenting major discrepancies relating to qualification (see paragraph
         7.8.5.1.1) are filed immediately above the latest affected AF Form 8/8a or, in cases
         where the memo is for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a, in
         chronological order with AF Forms 8/8a. Memos for record become a permanent part
         of the FEF only when the Major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed
         or corrected by a later Form 8/8a.
88     AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


         7.9.2.2.3. Memos for record documenting major discrepancies of a particular AF
         Form 8/8a will be filed on top of that AF Form 8/8a regardless of date the
         discrepancy is discovered.
         7.9.2.2.4. Memos for record documenting similar discrepancies found on multiple
         AF Forms 8/8a will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8/8a.
         7.9.2.2.5. Copies of these source documents may be filed with other unit agencies for
         evaluation program management.
  7.9.3. Description of Folders.
     7.9.3.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and
     constructed of heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
     7.9.3.2. Standard 2 Â¾-inch metal fasteners may be used.
     7.9.3.3. Affix a label bearing the individualâ€™s name and last four of SSAN to the inside
     back cover so that the folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information
     on the label if required.
     7.9.3.4. Folders must bear the â€•Privacy Actâ€– statement or a â€•For Official Use Onlyâ€–
     label/stamp on both sides of the FEF folder.
  7.9.4. Review of FEF. Document the procedures on how to accomplish an initial review
  and how to implement the periodic review of FEFs in the unit supplement to this instruction.
     7.9.4.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned
     aircrew members to establish their currency and qualification prior to their first flight.
         7.9.4.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the currency and
         qualification of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable
         documentation in Sections I and II of the FEF. Following determination of the
         currency and qualification of the aircrew member, the unit maintaining the FEF is
         responsible only for documentation subsequently placed in the FEF.
         7.9.4.1.2. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the
         stan/eval function at their assigned stations, that stan/eval function will also review
         the FEF prior to their first flight.
     7.9.4.2. Posting Review. The stan/eval function will review each AF Form 8/8a, AF
     Form 1381, or AF Form 4348 when they are placed in the FEF to ensure accuracy and
     completeness. This review will confirm that the eligibility period and qualification as
     documented are correct, all required flight evaluation events were accomplished and
     requisites were accomplished within the eligibility period and that the AF Form 8/8a
     contains all signatures and initials within allotted time. AF Forms 1381/4348 will be
     reviewed for correct certification signature and to ensure all previous entries are
     accounted for and are accurate. Document the posting review IAW unit or MAJCOM
     supplement.
     7.9.4.3. Periodic Review. The stan/eval function will review all unit FEFs to confirm
     expiration dates used to track required aircrew qualification evaluations are the same as
     those listed in the FEFs. The interval between reviews will not exceed the qualification
     period window established by paragraph 5.2.6.1 unless a more restrictive review period
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                  89


     is established by the MAJCOM supplement. Document the periodic review IAW unit or
     MAJCOM supplement. Periodic review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is not
     required.
     7.9.4.3. (ACC) Documentation of periodic reviews will be outlined in the unit
     supplement.
        7.9.4.3.1. (Added-SJAFB) Periodic Reviews will be accomplished during
        December of each year. The Periodic Review will be a complete and thorough
        review of the FEF, and accomplish the following:
            7.9.4.3.1.1. (Added-SJAFB) All Forms 8 are in reverse chronological sequence
            (most recent on top).
            7.9.4.3.1.2. (Added-SJAFB) AF Form 942 entries agree with all Forms 8
            7.9.4.3.1.3. (Added-SJAFB) Verify the individual has evaluation currency.
            7.9.4.3.1.4. (Added-SJAFB) Ensure all 4 FW generated Forms 8 are signed and
            dated correctly.
        7.9.4.3.2. (Added-SJAFB) On AF Form 942, enter â€•Annual Reviewâ€– under â€•Type
        of Evaluationâ€– and date accomplished under â€•Date Completedâ€– block.
  7.9.5. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8/8a, AF
  Form 1381, AF Form 4348, and AF Form 942.
     7.9.5.1. Categories of Discrepancies. Discrepancies are categorized by their impact on
     qualification/certification.
        7.9.5.1.1. Discrepancies that alter the qualification/certification of the affected
        aircrew member are considered major.
        7.9.5.1.2. Those discrepancies that do not alter the qualification/certification of the
        affected aircrew member are considered minor and include typos, formatting and
        misspellings.
     7.9.5.2. Major Discrepancies Disposition. Identified major discrepancies are
     documented on a permanent MFR filed in Section I or II immediately above the affected
     AF Form 8/8a/1381/4348, or in chronological order with the AF Forms 8/8a/1381/4348
     for items other than those found on AF Forms 8/8a/1381/4348. An MFR created to
     document late evaluations, OG/CC waivers, etc. is removed from the FEF once the
     information is incorporated onto the completed affected AF Form 8/8a under Examiner
     Remarks paragraph D, Additional Comments. Memos for record become a permanent
     part of the FEF only when the major discrepancy addressed by the MFR is not addressed
     or corrected by a later AF Form 8/8a.
     7.9.5.3. Minor Discrepancies Disposition. Minor discrepancies are documented on a
     non-permanent record as defined by the unit supplement to this instruction.
        7.9.5.3.1. The record of minor discrepancies is to be used to ensure standardization
        of AF Forms 8/8a, AF Forms 942, AF Forms 1381, AF Forms 4348, and aircrew
        member FEFs.
        7.9.5.3.2. Record of minor discrepancies need not reside in the FEF.
90     AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007


            7.9.5.3.2.1. (Added-SJAFB) Document Minor Discrepancies on the 4 OG FEF
            Review/Discrepancy Log. File the Log in FEF Section I behind the AF Form
            942.
         7.9.5.3.3. Any records of minor discrepancies kept in the FEF will be removed prior
         to any permanent change in station or status of the affected aircrew member.
     7.9.5.4. Corrections.
         7.9.5.4.1. AF Form 8/8a. As a source document, the AF Form 8/8a may be
         corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original
         document provided the flight examiner signing Section III of the form initials the
         correction.
         7.9.5.4.2. AF Form 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be
         altered without restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member
         and the contents of Section II of the FEF.
         7.9.5.4.3. AF Form 1381. As a source document, the AF Form 1381 may be
         corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original
         document provided the certifying official signing that line of the AF Form 1381
         initials the correction. For significant corrections, which alter the certificationâ€™s
         intent, make a new AF Form 1381 entry.
         7.9.5.4.4. AF Form 4348. As a source document, the AF Form 4348 may be
         corrected by use of white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original
         document provided the certifying official signing that line of the AF Form 4348
         initials the correction. For significant corrections, which alter the certificationâ€™s
         intent, make a new AF Form 4348 entry.
  7.9.6. Transfer of FEF. When custody of the FEF is transferred to a new unit or base:
     7.9.6.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the folder until reviewed by the
     gaining unit. After review, return to the individual those forms not retained in the folder.
     7.9.6.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting
     directly to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for
     transfer to the subsequent gaining unit.
     7.9.6.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF with
     their FRF to the gaining organization.
     7.9.6.3. (SJAFB) Ensure the latest copy of the Letter of Certification (Letter of Xs) is
     added to the individualâ€™s FEF during the out-processing of DOV.
         7.9.6.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the
         folder to the gaining unit.
         7.9.6.3.2. Mail any flight evaluation records not included in the folder at time of
         transfer to the gaining organization with clear identification of the individual
         concerned.
         7.9.6.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy until the gaining
         organization has received the original FEF.
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                               91


         7.9.6.3.4. If any FEF information is maintained electronically, a suitable storage
         media containing that information will be included with the FEF.
     7.9.6.4. (Added-SJAFB) Deployment of Unit/Individual. When a unit or individual
     deploys and requires information contained within the FEF, DOV will construct FEF
     extracts for all affected personnel.
         7.9.6.4.1. (Added-SJAFB) The FEF extract will consist of a copy of the Form 942
         and the most recent periodic and initial Forms 8. (i.e. INSTM/QUAL, MSN, and
         anything such as INIT INSTR or Flight Examiner Objectivity).
         7.9.6.4.2. (Added-SJAFB) If it is an individual or small group deployment, add the
         most recent copy of the Letter of Certification (Letter of Xs) to the FEF. For unit
         deployments this is not necessary.
  7.9.7. Disposition of FEF.
     7.9.7.1. Dispose of the aircrew FEF according to the Air Force Records Disposition
     Schedule (RDS).

                                           Chapter 8

                        SPECIALIZED AIRCREW PROCEDURES

8.1. Purpose This chapter provides guidance for Flight Surgeons and non-rated aircrew
personnel to include K-, Q-, and X- prefix Air Force Specialty Codes. EXCEPTION: Chapter
8 does not apply to X-prefix Aeromedical Evacuation crewmembers.
8.2. Flight Surgeon.
   8.2.1. Flight Surgeon Qualification. Basic initial and periodic flight surgeon qualification
   consists of an open-book examination; a flight evaluation is not required. Upon completion
   of the basic examination, flight surgeons will be qualified in all USAF aircraft (universal
   qualification). MAJCOMs and subordinate units may direct additional general and MDS-
   Specific flight surgeon requirements. Qualification requirements will be documented on AF
   Form 8/8a. Certification requirements will be documented on AF Forms 1381/4348.
   Qualification and certification, when required, must be accomplished before flight as an
   aircrew member.
   8.2.1. (ACC) Units will closely scrutinize the ability of the baseline Flight Surgeon open
   book test to fully qualify those personnel in unit aircraft. Any additional requirements driven
   by MDS or operating location specific procedures should be defined in unit supplements.
   8.2.2. Evaluations. Flight surgeon initial, periodic, and MDS-Specific (if required)
   examinations are considered QUAL evaluations. Other examinations are not required by this
   AFI, but may be prescribed in MAJCOM and subordinate unit supplements.
   8.2.3. Timing of Flight Surgeon Evaluations.
      8.2.3.1. Expiration Date. The required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the
      17th month following the month in which the date of the AF Form 8/8a was successfully
      completed.
      8.2.3.2. Scheduling. Schedule the periodic evaluation in the eligibility period (6-month
      period prior to expiration date).
      8.2.3.3. Extended Evaluations. The OG/CC may extend the expiration date of the Flight
      Surgeon periodic evaluation up to three months on a case-by-case basis. Inform
      AFMSA/SGPA. Document extended evaluations IAW paragraph 5.2.6.3.4.
   8.2.4. Requisite Completion. MAJCOMs may establish requisites for flight surgeons as
   necessary. Requisites from a completed evaluation or an examination used for re-currency
   will not be used for subsequent evaluations. All requisites for scheduled periodic evaluations
   in the eligibility period must be completed within the 6-month eligibility period prior to the
   expiration date of the current evaluation period to update that expiration date.
   8.2.5. Grading Policies. An overall qualification level of Q-1 will be awarded upon the
   successful completion of the flight surgeon examination(s).
   8.2.6. Flight Surgeon Failure to Complete an Evaluation Within the Required
   Period. If a flight surgeon fails to complete an evaluation prior to the qualification
   expiration date, the flight surgeon loses the qualification covered by the evaluation. The
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                                   93


  flight surgeon will not fly as a crew member until successful completion of the delinquent
  evaluation.
     8.2.6.1. Qualification is re-established by successfully completing the periodic
     examination(s).
     8.2.6.2. Document in the Comments block on the AF Form 8/8a the reason for out of the
     eligibility period evaluation.
  8.2.7. Flight Surgeon Examination.
     8.2.7.1. Administrative Procedures. Flight surgeons will complete a standardized
     open-book examination. Questions will be randomly generated from a test bank
     maintained by AFMOA/SG3P. MAJCOMs and subordinate organizations may establish
     additional requirements. Examinations will be completed in the unit stan/eval testing area
     or other appropriate location approved by the unit stan/eval chief.
     8.2.7.2. Grading Policy for Examination. The minimum passing grade for exams is 85
     percent â€“ corrected to 100 percent. The open book examination will be corrected to 100%
     and a certificate will be generated following successful completion. Units will validate
     successful completion of all required exams prior to flight. Document examination scores
     as Pass/Fail on the AF Form 8/8a.
     8.2.7.3. Examination Question Sources. AFMOA/SG3P, in coordination with
     AF/A3O-AT, will develop the basic flight surgeon examination. AF/A3O-AT will
     coordinate with applicable MAJCOMs.
     8.2.7.4. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. An evaluation will not be complete until
     failed exams have been successfully re-accomplished.
         8.2.7.4.1. Reexamination Policy. A flight surgeon failing a requisite examination at
         any time must be afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. The flight
         surgeon will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
         8.2.7.4.2. Reexamination Period. Failed requisite examination must be completed by
         successful reexamination before the flight surgeon can resume aircrew flying duties.

  Accomplish flight surgeon-specific actions as directed in this section.
     8.2.8.1. Section I â€“ Examinee Identification.
         8.2.8.1.1. Aircraft/Crew Position. When qualification for one specific aircraft is
         directed, enter aircraft MDS.
     8.2.8.2. Section II- Qualification.
         8.2.8.2.1. Flight Phase. A flight evaluation is not required.
         8.2.8.2.2. Expiration Date of Qualification. For an evaluation that establish a new
         eligibility period, enter the month and year that is 17 months after the month in which
         the last ground phase requisite was successfully completed.

current read file and publications. This library will consist of a minimum of four volumes as
listed in Table 9.1 in either hardcopy or electronic format.
   9.1.1. Required Volumes. Volume I is a table of contents for all volumes and current read
   file items, Volumes II through IV are made up of publications and flight manuals, and
   Volume V (optional) is reserved for flight safety information. If units choose hardcopy
   format and the contents of any volume exceed the capacity of its binder, use an additional
   binder and identify the first and subsequent binders by a letter of sequence (e.g., IIIA, IIIB).
   Label binders on the spine indicating Volume and Title as follows:
   9.1.1. (ACC) At OG/CCâ€™s discretion, the FCIF library may be electronic, provided
   measures are in place to ensure currency of publications and unrestricted access by
   crewmembers. Units will prepare to support deployed forces with appropriate FCIF
   information. Units will develop a deployment plan to successfully transfer or build a
   duplicate process to provide timely FCIF information to aircrews supporting deployed
   operations.
       9.1.1.1. (Added-ACC) Wing/Group agencies desiring to insert information into the
       FCIF will submit the information to OGV for coordination and distribution (Volume V
       excluded). Items entered into Volume I will be limited to those items that contain
       information temporary in nature. To prevent overwhelming the aircrew members with
       unnecessary details, salient points may be extracted from lengthy documents or
       highlighted if inclusion in Volume I is necessary. Above the Wing/Group level, the NAF
       or MAJCOM Stan/Eval function is the focal point for FCIF information.
       9.1.1.2. (Added-ACC) Units utilizing electronic media will ensure backup copies of
       FCIF Volumes I and II (paper or electronic) are maintained in case of connectivity
       problems, external power supply problems, or unit deployment/field conditions.
       9.1.1.3. (Added-SJAFB) OGV will conduct an annual review of the FCIF library to
       ensure the contents are complete and current IAW AFI 11-215. This annual review will

                 RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO AF PUBLICATIONS

A9.1. General. The stan/eval function is responsible for the orderly and efficient processing of
recommended changes to Air Force flying-related publications at each command level. Unless
different guidance is provided by the appropriate AF publication OPR, submit recommended
changes and improvements to Air Force publications on AF Form 847 according to the
procedures below and in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3 (covering completion of the form). Submit
recommended changes for conditions that have negative effects on operational efficiency, to
correct content errors or to recommend improved procedures or processes. Do not use the AF
Form 847 to call attention to typographical, printing or quality errors unless they cause
misinterpretation. Such deficiencies can be remedied by direct communication with the AF
publication OPR.
A9.2. Processing AF Forms 847.
   A9.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 through MAJCOM channels as outlined in the
   MAJCOM supplement to this instruction, in accordance with routing as outlined in Figure
   A9.1 and in compliance with instructions in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3. ANG units will
   utilize the NAF/MAJCOM command structure with oversight responsibility. Units will
   submit AF Forms 847 electronically to the maximum extent possible.
       A9.2.1.1. (Added-ACC) AFRC units with a group Stan/Eval office will submit routine
       AF Forms 847 to 10 AF/ A3V. Emergency/SIB AF Forms 847 will be submitted directly
       to AFRC/A3VS and to other organizations as required by AFI 11-215, USAF Flight
       Manuals Program (FMP).
   A9.2.2. At each level the stan/eval function will document receipt of original AF Forms 847,
   ensure the AF Form 847 reaches the appropriate functional OPR at that level for review,
   forward approved original AF Forms 847 to the next command level while informing the
   preceding command level of disposition (positive and negative) with comments. The advent
   of electronic Forms 847 may allow each level to inform all levels below (including the
   originator) of such disposition. The goal is to keep each command level and the originator
   advised of the progress and disposition of a submitted AF Form 847.
   A9.2.3. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will forward the reviewed original AF Form
   847 to the AF publication OPR. Once the AF publication OPR decides on disposition of the
   AF Form 847, the AF publication OPR will notify the submitting, parent MAJCOM as to
   disposition. The parent MAJCOM will then inform the lower command levels of the
   disposition of the original AF Form 847.
   A9.2.4. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will simultaneously forward information
   copies of AF Forms 847 to all other MAJCOMs that utilize the subject AF publication. The
   other using MAJCOMs may forward comments on the information AF Form 847 suggestions
   to the AF publication OPR.
   A9.2.5. An AF Form 847 may be disapproved by any command level reviewing the original
   AF Form 847. All disapproved recommendations will be returned to the submitting
   command level with justification annotated on the AF Form 847 stating the reason for the
   disapproval. Disapproved recommendations are not normally forwarded to other MAJCOMs,
AFI11-202V2_ACCSUP_SEYMOURJOHNSONAFBSUP_I 10 DECEMBER 2007                               177


   but may be forwarded for additional considerations if desired. MAJCOMs may address how
   to resubmit an AF Form 847 disapproved at a command level below the AF publication OPR
   in their supplement to this instruction.
   A9.2.6. The movement and disposition of the original AF Form 847 will be tracked by the
   stan/eval function at all command levels that review the original AF Form 847. There is no
   requirement to track receipt or disposition of information copies of an AF Form 847.
