SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises Table 2.4, 6 AMW Weather Limitations, and changes the hail
limitation to ¼ inch or more. Figure 2.7, Sample Air Sensitivities and Impacts Image 2, was
updated to include mention of avoiding the tropopause by plus or minus 4,000ft and avoiding
mountain wave turbulence as a sensitivity to the C-37 aircraft. Table 8.1, Weather Watches
and Lead Times, was revised to change the hail watch criteria to > ¼ inch. Table 8.2, Weather
Warnings and Lead Times, was revised to change the hail warning criteria to > ¼ inch. Table
8.3, Weather Advisories, was revised to correct an error in the ―>‖ symbols for crosswind and
wind advisories. Table 8.4, Conditions Requiring Notification/Activation of SWAT Standby
Member, was updated to make SWAT activation procedures consistent with the revised
Watch/Warning criteria. Table A.4.2, Visibility, and Table A.4.3, Runway Visual Range
(RVR), were changed to align special weather observation criteria with AFMAN 15-111 and
Flight Information Publication guidance. Additionally, paragraph 7.3.4 was deleted.

This change also revises paragraph 3.6 Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW) and paragraphs
3.6.1 through 3.6.6. The revisions are necessary to differentiate between Auto and Augmented
(manual) observations and to identify conditions that require tower personnel should notify
weather personnel. This interim change also deletes paragraph 3.8 Wet Bulb Globe
Temperature Index (WBGTI). The 6th Aerospace Medicine Squadron, Bioenvironmental
Engineering (6 AMDS/SGPB), has full responsibility for monitoring WBGT in accordance with
Air Force Pamphlet 48-151. An asterisk (*) indicates new or revised material since the previous
edition. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

                                GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. The 6th Operations Support Squadron, Weather Flight (6 OSS/OSW), Combat
   Weather Flight (CWF), is responsible for providing or arranging weather support for the 6
   AMW, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Aircraft Operations
   Center, and all other MacDill AFB agencies. This instruction establishes weather support
   requirements and procedures as outlined in Air Force directives and has been coordinated at
   the local level to meet the mission needs of all supported customers. The terms Weather
   Flight (WF) and CWF can be used interchangeably, and in this instruction they both refer to
   the 6 OSS/OSW. The CWF is the focal point for all weather-related issues. This instruction
   establishes requirements and procedures pertaining to weather support during peacetime
   operations. This instruction will be reviewed annually and updated as required.
   1.1.2. Contacting the CWF: Weather personnel can be reached by phone at DSN 968-
   4405/2854 or commercial at 813-828-4405/2845 and telefax by DSN 968-6936 or
   commercial 813-828-6936. During non-duty hours, you may contact a member of the CWF
   through the 6 AMW Command Post (CP) at DSN 968-4361 or commercial 813-828-4361.
   1.1.3. References, abbreviations, acronyms, and certain terms used in this document are
   defined in Attachment 1.
1.2. Concept of Operations (Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)-CWF Flight Concept).
   1.2.1. The Air Force Strategic Plan on Weather Reengineering and AFI 15-128 mandated
   several changes be made to improve operational weather support. Under reengineering, the
   world has been divided into ten centralized Areas of Responsibility (AOR). Each AOR has a
   designated OWS responsible for providing operational-level aerospace weather support to
   operational units assigned within and/or deployed into its AOR.
   1.2.2. Based on the guidance in the Strategic Plan, the 26 OWS at Barksdale AFB,
   Louisiana, will provide regional and operational-level weather products and information to
   Air Force units in the Southeast region of the Continental United States (CONUS).
   1.2.3. Based on the guidance in the Strategic Plan, the CWF at each Air Force location will
   focus on providing tactical-level weather products and information needed for mission
   execution and provide weather products and information to the commander of deployed
   forces during wartime, contingency, and exercise operations.
1.3. Responsibilities. General responsibilities of the OWSs and CWFs are outlined in AFI 15-
128. Specific responsibilities of the 26 OWS and MacDill’s CWF are defined in the
Memorandum of Agreement 15-54 between the 6 OSS and the 26 OWS and in this instruction.
The 26 OWS provides timely, accurate, and relevant weather information and products for Air
Force and Army operations in the southeastern U.S. AOR. They produce and disseminate
weather watches, warnings, and advisories; Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF); regional and
operational level weather products; and flight weather briefings for transient aircrews. The 26
OWS also conducts a Meteorological Watch (METWATCH) within its AOR and amends its
8                                                         MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008


forecast product(s) when specified criteria are met. 26 OWS products are available on their
website at https://ows.barksdale.af.mil/. These include the latest observed and forecast weather
conditions, forecast weather watches, warnings and advisories, and transient flight weather
briefings. This suite of products is transmitted from the 26 OWS to the 6 OSS/OSW using the
New Tactical Forecast System (NTFS). Forecast products for MacDill AFB are produced in
collaboration with the CWF. Additionally, the CWF will support the base in thoroughly
educating agencies on the purpose, applicability, and operating procedures of weather products
and base operations as required by directives (AFI 10-2501) or directed by the 6 AMW
Commander (6 AMW/CC).
1.4. Duty Priorities.
     1.4.1. 26 OWS Duty Priorities. 26 OWS duty priorities listed in Table 1.1 exist to match
     and balance limited manning and mission critical tasks. Duty priorities focus efforts during
     peak work periods prone to task saturation and priority conflicts. Weather operators will use
     good judgment in complying with these duty priorities, especially when there is imminent
     danger to life and/or property.

1.5. Operational Hours. Airfield services will be provided from 0600-2300L. See paragraph
3.2. for specific airfield services. Staff services, listed in Chapter 5, are available during normal
duty hours or as required. All supported units should coordinate with the 6 OSS/OSW to change
this instruction or request special or additional support not addressed in this instruction.
1.6. Backup Weather Support Procedures.
      1.6.1. 6 OSS/OSW backup weather support procedures. If the CWF is unable to provide
      weather support for any reason, the 26 OWS will provide backup support according to the
      following three tiers of mission support outlined in Table 1.3
      1.6.2. Backup power requirements. The 6 OSS/OSW operations section is located in Hangar
      3 which provides generator backup power. In the event that primary and generator power
      both fail, Weather Flight operations will move to the alternate operating location as outlined
      in paragraph 1.7 If the alternate location is also without power, the 26 OWS will provide
      backup support according to the three tiers of mission support outlined in Table 1.3

Table 1.3. Three-Tier Backup Support Priority Table.

      1.6.3. 26 OWS backup weather support procedures. When weather operations at the 26
      OWS are interrupted for any reason (e.g., power outage, natural disaster, etc.), responsibility
      for MacDill AFB’s TAF, weather watches, warnings, and advisories will be transferred to the
      6 OSS/OSW until such time as the 26 OWS can resume operations.
      1.6.4. Airfield services will be provided 24-hours a day during real world contingencies or as
      directed by 6 AMW/CC. 6 OSS/OSW will sign out two (2) Tactical Aircrew Alerting
      Network (TAAN) radios with chargers from 6 AMW/XPO and ensure that a weather
      technician is monitoring at all times. 6 OSS/OSW will transmit alert weather via NTFS
MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008                                                                11


   when they hear either a ―Report to Aircraft‖ or ―Klaxon‖ notification over the TAAN. Alert
   weather will be readily available when queried by 6 AMW/CPO. During Alert Aircraft
   Repositioning Plan, alert weather will be issued at 55 minutes past each hour via NTFS or by
   6 AMW/CPO hotline.
1.7. Alternate Operating Location.
   1.7.1. In the event the CWF evacuates, operations will reestablish at the alternate operating
   location in the main lobby of the Deployed Unit Complex (DUC), Building 71 (see
   Attachment 2 for directions).
   1.7.2. All affected agencies will be notified of the evacuation and subsequent return to the
   primary work center.
   1.7.3. Wind and pressure values from any form of backup equipment will be estimated while
   at the alternate operating location. Estimate wind and pressure values by including the
   proper remark in the observation (i.e., WND DATA ESTMD, ALSTG/SLP ESTMD) in
   column 13 of AF Form 3803, Surface Weather Observations (METAR/SPECI) (AFMAN 15-
   111, Chapter 2).
1.8. Release of Weather Information to Non-Department of Defense (DoD) Agencies and
Individuals. Weather information will not be released to non-DoD agencies or the general
public without approval from Public Affairs Office (6 AMW/PA) and Staff Judge Advocate (6
AMW/JA). Any questions/clarifications will be coordinated through the CWF Superintendent.
1.9. Post-Mission Analysis/Feedback.
   1.9.1. Per AFMAN 15-129, Chapter 4, units that regularly utilize weather support from
   MacDill’s Combat Weather Flight (6 OSS/OSW) will provide post-mission/utilization
   feedback, when possible. This information will be used to ensure proper quality assurance
   (QA) and to provide a metrics database. Formal/informal feedback methods include:
       1.9.1.1. Transient (faxed) and local weather brief feedback forms located on the back of
       MEF sheets.
       1.9.1.2. Email and/or phone calls to the flight commander or superintendent.
       1.9.1.3. Routing through the base mail system.
       1.9.1.4. Face to face feedback after any briefing.
   1.9.2. The CWF will, in turn, utilize this data to refine their mission support role and gauge
   unit strengths and weaknesses. Representative sample sizes are necessary to accurately
   reflect the satisfaction and accuracy of the weather support being provided to MacDill’s
   flying units by the CWF.
1.10. Mishap Procedures. Both CWF members have a role when the airfield is advised of an
emergency or mishap. The Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) and the OWS are also involved.
See the Aircraft Emergency/Mishap SOP in the CWF operations area for more details. In
general, the CWF will ensure applicable data used in the development of any weather
information, product, and/or service provided/saved for an investigation (to include MEFs,
Tactical Decision Aids (TDA), space weather products, mission impact slides, etc.) is saved.
The CWF will save enough data before and after the mishap to fully reconstruct the
environmental conditions including activating the Aircraft Accident Investigation (AAI) function
12                                                      MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008


on NTFS as a fail-safe measure. The CWF will coordinate with AFWA Help Desk at DSN 271-
2586/Commercial 402-294-2586 or 1-800-250-1750 to save all applicable data and products that
AFWA produced/provided in preparing flight weather MEFs and/or other CWF products. The
CWF will specify what data they need AFWA to save. (Note: Duplication of saved data
between the CWF and AFWA is not required.) The CWF will also coordinate with the 26 OWS
to initiate a data save for OWS-produced/provided products used in preparing flight weather
MEFs. If the CWF used products from other OWSs to support missions crossing AORs, they
must coordinate with all applicable OWS’s to initiate a data save. If the OWS provided the flight
weather MEF or other products, they will coordinate the data save with all AFW units involved.
The CWF at the departure installation and the mishap location (if on a military installation) will
follow the Aircraft Mishap procedures in Chapter 1 of AFMAN 15-129.
1.11. Operational Report (OPREP)-3 Reporting. The 6 OSS/OSW will contact 6 AMW/CP
within 15 minutes of observing severe weather at MacDill AFB. The criteria are: hail 3/4‖ or
greater, winds 50kts or stronger, or if a tornado is observed or reported at MacDill AFB. In
accordance with AFMAN 15-129, Chapter 4, the weather flight will provide the 6 AMW/CP
with data that includes the pertinent forecast and weather warning criteria. 6 AMW/CP will
forward an OPREP-3 report to higher headquarters in accordance with AFI 10-229.

2.6. Training Missions, Operating Areas, and Weather Sensitivities. Due to the size of the
training areas (listed in MACDILLAFBI 11-250), there are very few instances when weather will
make an operating area completely unusable. Pilot discretion is used to determine mission
go/no-go regardless of the weather phenomena listed in the MEF or briefed.
2.7. Primary Customer Weather Limitations. 6 OSS/OSW gains weekly exposure to
MacDill’s customer leadership through briefings and daily weather discussions. Increased
awareness of mission limitations is necessary for proper tailored weather support. The following
tables provide primary organizational weather limitations:

                          AIRFIELD OBSERVATION SERVICES

3.1. General. Airfield observation services include those weather-related actions that affect the
MacDill aerodrome (defined within 5 nautical miles of the airfield) or the base as a whole.
Examples include weather observations, Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV), and resource
protection. Resource protection will be addressed in Chapter 8.
3.2. Operational Hours. Airfield services are provided 7 days a week between the hours of
0600L-2300L. Between the hours of 2300L-0600L, the FMQ-19 will send observations
automatically. Services will be provided 24-hours a day during real-world contingencies and
when directed by 6 AMW/CC or the 6th Operations Group Commander (6 OG/CC).
3.3. Observations. Observations are taken, recorded, and disseminated in accordance with
AFMAN 15-111. Observations typically contain the following elements: observation type;
date/time; winds; visibility; present weather; cloud groups; temperature/dew-point; altimeter
setting; and additional remarks. There are three types of observations (described below) that are
seen by customers on MacDill AFB. Attachment 3 contains examples of the different types of
observations.
   3.3.1. Official Observing Site. This is the physical location from which the weather
   technician determines sky condition, present weather, and prevailing visibility. MacDill’s
   official observation site is located at the northwest corner of Hangar 3 (location of Base
   Operations). The view to the southeast is completely blocked. The weather technician will
   augment the FMQ-19 automated observing system to provide the official observation.
   3.3.2. METAR (Routine Meteorological Observation Report). METAR observations are
   taken and disseminated every hour between 55 and 59 minutes after the hour. The
   observation is taken from the Official Observing Site. METAR observations are
   disseminated both locally and longline.
   3.3.3. SPECI (Special Observation). SPECI observations are taken whenever certain
   weather events, defined in AFMAN 15-111 and listed in Attachment 4, occur at MacDill
   AFB. These observations are disseminated both locally and longline.
3.4. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). Weather personnel conduct a BWW in accordance with
AFMAN 15-111. This is a process where the CWF routinely monitors weather conditions.
Besides taking scheduled hourly METAR observations, weather personnel recheck weather
conditions at least every 20 minutes when any of the following are observed to be occurring or
are forecast to occur within 1 hour. NOTE: In addition to the below minimum requirements,
weather personnel will remain alert for any other changes in weather conditions that will require
a Special observation. Weather personnel will also monitor area observation and forecast
products as often as necessary to keep abreast of changes expected to affect their area of
responsibility.
   3.4.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
   3.4.2. Visibility is 3 miles (4800 meters) or less.
   3.4.3. Precipitation (any form) is observed.
24                                                        MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008


     3.4.4. Fog or mist is present.
3.5. Continuous Weather Watch. A continuous weather watch is the process by which
weather personnel continuously watch weather conditions without performing any other duties.
There is no established requirement for a continuous weather watch at MacDill AFB.
3.6. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). The CWW is a process for Air Traffic Control
(ATC) and flying unit personnel to report changes in weather conditions to the on-duty weather
forecaster (828-4405/2854). Except for system outages or events beyond the capability of the
system, Weather observations are produced by the FMQ-19. Observations are characterized as
either auto or augmented. Auto observations are produced by the FMQ-19 without any weather
technician interaction. Augmented observations are produced when weather technicians
manually add data to the observation generated by the FMQ-19 for two reasons: conditions are
present beyond the system’s capability, or when the FMQ-19 is not operating within acceptable
parameters. Examples of parameters that are beyond the capabilities of the FMQ-19 are
visibilities below one quarter statute mile, hail, and tornadic activity. If deemed representative of
the actual weather conditions on the runway complex, Weather Flight personnel may use the
CWW reported information to augment the next surface observation or use the information as a
basis for manually generating a new observation. CWW inherently dictates close contact
between the MacDill Weather Flight and the previously mentioned organizations or personnel,
especially tower personnel. Weather Flight leadership will be responsible for ensuring CWW
compliance by coordinating with associated CWW unit leadership. Due to the distance between
airfield sensors and the tower, it is quite possible for there to be a significant difference in
accurate tower visibility and automated weather observations. Tower personnel will notify
weather personnel when any of the following are seen or occur on MacDill AFB:
     3.6.1. Rapid decrease of visibility that lowers any sector visibility to below four miles.
     3.6.2. Tower prevailing visibility is less than 4 statute miles and different from the surface
     prevailing visibility.
     3.6.3. Precipitation begins or ends.
     3.6.4. Thunderstorms and/or lightning are initially observed.
     3.6.5. Rapid development of cloud layers or rapid changes in cloud heights.
     3.6.6. Any other meteorological condition that could have significant impact on the airfield
     or aircraft operations (i.e., hail, wind damage, etc.).
3.7. METWATCH. METWATCH provides an organized approach for weather personnel to
maintain situational awareness of the current/future meteorological situation within a designated
area(s). This process involves notifying supported units and updating any forecast products
when pre-established weather conditions or unforecast changes (timing, location, or forecast
values) in weather occur or are expected to occur. All on-site meteorological and commercial
data sources (MetSat, Weather Radar, Websites, NOAA Weather Radio, etc.) may be used to
accomplish this task. The 26 OWS will perform a continuous Terminal METWATCH for
MacDill AFB. CWF personnel will act as the ―eyes forward‖ for the 26 OWS by providing
immediate feedback on current or short-term anticipated changes in weather conditions. 26
OWS will also perform Flight and Route METWATCH for transient flights they briefed that are
departing from MacDill AFB. The CWF will perform Flight and Route METWATCH for
MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008                                                              25


transient flights departing MacDill AFB that were briefed by CWF personnel. Note: Though
similar to MISSIONWATCH (Chapter 4, paragraph 4.5), transient missions (cross country, etc.)
are not considered ―local‖ though the mission may have originated/terminated at MacDill AFB.
   3.7.1. EYES FORWARD Process/Procedure. This process/procedure is the CWF’s role in
   allowing for the integration of weather data, meteorological satellite imagery, lightning
   detection readouts, and non-standard weather data systems to create an integrated weather
   picture and near-term forecast for the OWS. We provide meaningful meteorological
   information not contained in the coded observations to the 26 OWS as an integral part of our
   METWATCH process (phone calls, emails, etc.). Additionally, we integrate the current state
   of the atmosphere into an understanding of future impacts on forecast conditions and
   communicate the impacts/information to the 26 OWS, as needed.

   3.8.1. (DELETED)
   3.8.2. (DELETED)
   3.8.3. (DELETED)
3.9. Pilot-to-METRO Service (PMSV) Support. Weather information is available via PMSV
24-hours a day on frequency 344.6 MHz. The duty forecaster will monitor PMSV traffic during
duty hours for all aircraft contacts. During closure hours, PMSV will be monitored by
Jacksonville Naval Air Station (NAS). There will be a minimum of one radio check each day to
verify PMSV radio is in full service. For aircraft outside the range of our PMSV system, PMSV
support can be obtained through a phone patch to the 6 AMW/CP at DSN 968-4361, Commercial

                             MISSION FORECAST SERVICES

4.1. General. Mission forecast services are those weather-related actions directly related to
completing each customer’s daily mission(s) (e.g., Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts, Flight
Weather Briefings). The Mission Execution Forecast (MEF) is the primary tool used to
accomplish these tasks. MEFs are tailored to individual customer requirements and may be
anything from a local flight weather briefing to a change-of-command weather forecast. Any
event, both flying and non-flying, that will be affected by weather normally requires some sort of
MEF.
4.2. Operational Hours. Mission forecast services are provided 7 days a week from 0600L-
2300L. Any briefings required between 2300L-0600L will be prepared by the 26 OWS FWB
section and faxed to the customer.
4.3. Terminal Aerodrome Forecasts (TAF). MacDill AFB TAFs will be produced and
disseminated by the 26 OWS in accordance with AFI 15-128, AFMAN 15-124, AFMAN 15-
129, and MOA 15-54. Forecast specification and amendment criteria are listed in Attachment 5.
TAFs are valid for 24 hours, apply to the area within a 5 nautical mile (NM) radius of the
MacDill AFB airfield complex, and will be issued every 8 hours.
4.4. Mission Execution Forecasts (MEF). MEFs are essentially mission-specific forecasts that
are developed using a 12-step process outlined in AFMAN 15-129, and may be provided by a
number of methods (verbally, person-to-person, 175-1s, etc.). During this process, the CWF will
fuse and tailor products created by strategic and theater weather centers, as well as information
supplied by local units (e.g., flying schedule) and agencies.             The end result is a
product/information designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence to
various customers by whatever means proves most effective. MEFs must be horizontally
consistent with (but not necessarily mirror) products issued by the 26 OWS and AFWA.
However, during rapidly changing conditions, emergencies, or when conditions threaten resource
protection, the CWF will amend the MEF to accurately reflect conditions and back-brief the 26
OWS when time permits.
   4.4.1. MacDill MEFs. MEFs are generated by the CWF forecaster as needed. The MacDill
   MEF is the primary briefing tool for all wing flying missions, which are normally included
   on the wing flying schedule. The daily wing flying schedule is used to generate MEFs for
   missions taking place on the particular day. The MEFs provide temperature, enroute and
   flight-level winds, hazards, space weather impacts, current watches, warnings, and
   advisories, and forecasted destination and alternate weather conditions. All MEFs are
   provided 3 hours prior to takeoff. The MEFs are completed using a computer-generated
   form. The MacDill MEF is the primary briefing tool for all wing flying missions. However,
   other alternate briefing forms are available, such as 175-1 and verbal briefings. Missions not
   included on the Daily Flying Schedule should be coordinated as soon as possible and in
   advance, if time permits. The CWF forecaster will also perform a MISSION METWATCH
   for mission limiting weather at MacDill, destination location, and planned alternates.
   4.4.2. Flight Weather Briefings. Weather personnel will provide verbal or traditional Flight
   Weather Briefings (DD Form 175-1, Flight Weather Briefing) to aircrews as requested
28                                                       MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008


     following the flight’s duty priorities listed in Table 1.2 Briefings will be lead-time as
     possible to complete the request. Out-of-station mass briefings for special missions generally
     require 72-hours advanced notice, are subject to staffing availability, and must be
     coordinated with weather station leadership. Aircrews operating away from home base will
     schedule flight weather briefings with the appropriate OWS, preferably 2 or more hours prior
     to flight time. There is an internet-based aircrew weather briefing system in the
     operations/flight planning area for transient aircrews to obtain weather data from the
     appropriate OWS. The 26 OWS can be contacted by phone, fax, or via internet access
     (https://ows.barksdale.af.mil) under Briefing Request.
     4.4.3. Hurricane MEF. In accordance with AFI 10-2501, when tropical systems are within
     (or forecast to be within) 500 NM of MacDill AFB, the CWF will issue a hurricane MEF
     after the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issues bulletins (typically every 6 hours). The
     hurricane MEF may be issued at any time deemed necessary by weather leadership and/or
     requested by base leadership. The MEF will contain all the latest information regarding the
     movement and forecast track of the storm, as well as any impact on MacDill AFB. In
     addition, to ensure the MacDill AFB community is up-to-date on the latest hurricane
     forecasts, the CWF will send emails of the latest MEF to wing leadership (Wing CC, Group
     CC, etc.) detailing the current situation as described by the NHC. At a minimum, the NHC’s
     latest plot and forecast discussion summary will be included in the email.
     4.4.4. Hurricane Briefings. The CWF will provide the most up-to-date weather briefings
     regarding any tropical cyclone activity anytime deemed necessary by the MacDill CAT
     and/or senior wing leadership. The hurricane briefing will take place at the CAT briefing
     room. Adequate time will be provided for the CWF to evaluate the latest NHC advisory,
     compile and prepare other pertinent information, and provide meteorological input/advice.
     The NHC advisories provide the ―official forecast‖ information and will not be deviated from
     when briefing base leadership. These advisories will provide the foundation for CWF
     forecast products (winds, hurricane direction, etc.). CWF forecast inputs, however, may
     provide additional guidance to senior leadership based on their experience and training.
4.5. MISSION WATCH. This term is used to describe the process by which the CWF
monitors the weather for all local missions, to include all working areas. All on-site
meteorological and commercial data sources (satellite, radar, internet sites, etc.) may be used to
accomplish this task. It is through this method that MEF amendments/updates are accomplished.
During rapidly changing weather, the CWF will amend/update the MEF as required and contact
the 6 AMW/CP to pass on critical changes.
MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008                                                                     29

                                STAFF WEATHER SERVICES

5.1. General. Staff services are those briefings provided primarily by CWF leadership. These
briefings are a specialized type of MEF focused on a particular event/audience. Examples
include, but are not limited to, staff meetings, CAT meetings, and Instrument Refresher Course
briefings.
5.2. Operational Hours. The majority of briefs are provided during normal duty hours (0730-
1700L). Contingency, hurricane, exercise briefings, and other briefing support are provided as
needed.
5.3. Staff Briefings. Staff weather briefings for 6 AMW will be provided as required. Standard
information includes a satellite picture, 3-day weather outlook, and weather impacts for
upcoming missions.
5.4. Air Traffic Control (ATC) Limited Observation Training. ATC Limited Observation
Training is provided by the weather flight. The ATC individual seeking training will call the
weather flight and schedule an appointment to receive training. After ATC personnel complete
the training, they will take a short test on the information and receive a familiarization tour of the
weather station.
5.5. Instrument Refresher Course (IRC) Briefings. The CWF provides IRC briefings as
required by course scheduling in accordance with AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Course
(IRC) Program, and AFMAN 15-129. The weather portion of the briefing consists of an
overview of the CWF’s Airfield and Mission Services, CWF capabilities, CWF and OWS
responsibilities, resource protection, seasonal/regional weather, and space weather impacts
(when applicable).
5.6. Crisis Action Team (CAT) Briefings. The CWF will provide weather briefings as
required for CAT meetings. This includes but is not limited to exercise, hurricane (hurricane
evacuation/hurricane condition (HUREVAC/HURCON) support), and deployment briefings.
Each briefing will be tailored to provide the appropriate weather intelligence required by wing
leadership.
5.7. Climatology Briefings. Climatology information will be provided as requested.
5.8. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) Weather Updates. The CWF is responsible for
ensuring all weather information in the FLIP is accurate. All weather related updates will be
requested through the Airfield Management Operations FLIP Manager, 6 OSS/OSA. The FLIP
Manager will process the information to the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA/OL-D).
Updates will fall into one of three categories: revisions, changes, or corrections.

                      SPACE WEATHER SUPPORT AND SERVICES

6.1. General. Many of our weapons and communications systems use satellites and radio waves
(High Frequency (HF), Very High Frequency (VHF), Ultra High Frequency (UHF), and Satellite
Communications (SATCOM)), that can be rendered useless by electro-magnetic radiation from
the sun. This chapter contains some brief information regarding space weather limitations, alerts
and warnings, and products available to MacDill personnel (also see WII-02-02 for more
details).
6.2. Limitations. Like terrestrial weather, there are numerous factors that influence space
weather. One of the biggest limitations we have in identifying and forecasting space weather is a
lack of sensors. Additionally, given the speed of solar wind and light, our ability to provide lead-
times for significant space events is extremely limited.
6.3. Space Weather Alerts and Warnings. MacDill’s missions have a wide variety of
parameters possibly affected by various space weather conditions (HF and UHF communication,
radar, Global Positioning System (GPS) Comm, etc.). Broad coverage CONUS-based space
weather products are available at https://weather.afwa.af.mil/space.html and will be used to
update the Space Weather portion (HF and UHF) of the MEF. GPS communication will be
monitored for specific missions upon request (see paragraph 6.4). Space Weather analysis,
alerts, forecasts, and warnings are listed in AFMAN 15-129, Table 4.3, Space Weather Analyses,
Forecast, Alerts, and Warnings. Additionally, Space Weather Impacts will be reported through
the appropriate link on this site. Bulletins are also available through the Joint Air Force and
Army Weather Information Network (JAAWIN) at https://weather.afwa.af.mil/space.html. A
sample of the daily discussion is provided in Table 6.1. See the links above for current Space
Environment Discussions, including potential impacts to Air Force Operations.
MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008                                                              31


Figure 6.1. Sample Space Environment Discussion.




6.4. Products. Numerous space weather products are available from JAAWIN (see links
above). Most space weather products from the strategic center are ―now-casts‖ and/or very
short-term forecasts (6-hourly periods), so the duty forecaster will check websites for updated
products when a new TAF is issued and update the MEF accordingly (see AFMAN 15-129,
Table 4.3, Potential Space Weather Impacts, for a list of potential space weather impacts).
For more information concerning these products, please contact the Air Force Weather Agency
or the CWF.
   6.4.1. GPS Products. GPS products are primarily ―now-casts‖ and/or <1 hourly forecast.
   Due to the frequent refresh rate required for monitoring these products, the MEF provides a
   web link. Duty forecasters will only need to monitor these products when specifically
   requested by the customer. See https://weather.afwa.af.mil/conus_space.html for further
   details.

                                           Chapter 8

                          RESOURCE PROTECTION SERVICES

8.1. General. This chapter contains details on weather watches, warnings, and advisories.
Resource protection is accomplished through a joint effort between the 26 OWS and the MacDill
CWF. The 26 OWS is responsible for issuing all forecasted weather watches and warnings. The
CWF acts as the ―eyes forward‖ for the 26 OWS, and is responsible for issuing all observed
warnings and advisories (annotated on the appropriate AF Form 3806, Weather Watch Advisory
Log, and AF Form 3807, Watch/Warning Notification and Verification). However, the CWF can
issue any forecasted warning if there is an immediate threat to life and/or property. In these
cases, the CWF will back brief the OWS when time permits and will also be responsible for
dissemination to local supported agencies. Conversely, the CWF will act as the alternate
dissemination/notification source for the OWS. The goal is to provide the best possible resource
protection to MacDill AFB.
8.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice sent to customers indicating that
conditions are favorable for the development of a particular type of weather phenomena (e.g.,
tornadoes, hail, etc.). Watches are issued for a 5 NM radius of the center-point of the MacDill
runway complex. Table 8.1 contains all of the weather watches and desired lead-times issued
for MacDill AFB.

8.4. Observed Weather Warnings. In accordance with AFOSHSTD 91-66, General Industrial
Operations, and AFOSHSTD 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line - Ground Operations and Activities,
lightning warnings are the only type of observed warning issued on MacDill AFB. They extend
5 NM in all directions from the airfield. Lightning warnings are not issued until lightning is
observed, either visually or via the National Lightning Detection Network. The lightning
warning will remain valid until lightning has not occurred in the area for at least 15 minutes.
The CWF will provide timely notification to all supported units upon issuance and expiration of
a lightning warning.
8.5. Observed Weather Advisories. An observed weather advisory is a special notice sent to
customers alerting them that a predefined weather phenomenon which may impact operations is
currently occurring on MacDill AFB. There are no forecasted weather advisories for MacDill
AFB. Observed weather advisories are located in Table 8.3

 Moderate or Greater Icing below 10,000’
 Low Level Wind Shear (not associated with
 thunderstorms)
 *Winds ≥ 25 kts
 Lightning within 5 NM (Warning)

8.6. Format. Advisories, watches, and warnings will be numbered consecutively by identifying
the type of weather message (watch, warning, or advisory) followed by a five-digit number. The
first two numbers indicate the current month while the second three numbers indicate the
sequence number. For example, the message ―Weather Warning 02-005‖ means the month is
February (02), and this is the fifth (005) warning issued in the month. The message ―Weather
Advisory 12-013‖ means the month is December (12), and this is the thirteenth (013) advisory
issued in the month. Examples of different messages are contained in Attachment 3. Note: In
the event that N-TFS is inoperable, the AF Form 3806 and/or AF Form 3807 will be filled out by
the duty forecaster.

8.7. Upgrades/Downgrades. Advisories and warnings will be upgraded (i.e., winds increase
from 35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead
times specified above. Only one forecasted warning may be in effect at one time. If a
warning is issued for one criteria and it becomes necessary to warn for another criteria, a new
warning, with a new number, will be issued to include all criteria expected. A separate valid
time may be specified for each criteria, if necessary.
8.8. Amendments. Amendments to weather warnings and watches will only be issued to
change the valid time and will be issued before the original watch or warning expires. New
warnings and watches will be issued for any change in weather criteria.
8.9. Cancellation. Warnings and watches may be canceled when the weather phenomena are no
longer occurring or expected to occur. However, if not canceled, they will expire at the end of
the valid period. Observed advisories will be canceled when the criteria is no longer occurring
and is not expected to occur again in the next hour. See paragraph 8.4 for cancellation of
observed lightning warnings.
8.10. Toxic Corridor. Per AFI 10-2501, toxic corridor responsibility lies with the Fire
Protection Flight with assistance from the Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight. The CWF will
provide weather data necessary to calculate toxic corridors to the Fire Protection Flight and/or
the disaster control group, as requested. The CWF will also maintain the capability to calculate
toxic corridors as a back-up. The OWS may supplement meteorological data to the appropriate
MacDill organizations if requested and the CWF is unable to provide the data (reference
AFMAN 10-2602, Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Conventional (NBCC) Defense
Operations and Standards).
8.11. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). The Severe Weather Action Procedures
(SWAP) are in place to ensure sufficient personnel are available during potential/actual severe
weather events or during meteorological/operational events critical to mission success. For the
purpose of these procedures, severe weather is defined as any weather phenomenon considered
critical enough by the customer to require advance/special notice and subsequent actions to
prevent serious injury or damage to personnel, property, or resources. It is imperative that timely
and accurate weather watches, warnings, and advisories are disseminated to all MacDill AFB
agencies to ensure personnel and resource protection. These procedures document a two-tier
system with the 6 OSS CWF and the 26 OWS sharing responsibilities for SWAP and resource
protection.
     8.11.1. 6 OSS CWF Responsibilities. 6 OSS CWF will perform the CWF SWAP
     responsibilities as defined in AFMAN 15-129, AFI 10-229, AFI 10-206, MACDILLAFBI
     15-101, and MOA 15-54. More specifically, 6 OSS CWF will accomplish the following
     procedures:
     8.11.2. Notification. The duty forecaster will notify the Severe Weather Action Team
     (SWAT) standby member(s) according to the following guidance:
        8.11.2.1. During normal staff duty hours (0730 to 1700 ET, Monday through Friday,
        except federal holidays/authorized down days), the duty forecaster will implement SWAP
        by notifying the CWF Flight Chief and CWF noncommissioned officer in charge
        (NCOIC) by phone whenever one or more conditions in Table 8.4 are met. It is likely
        the above personnel will be present in the weather station and do not need to be recalled.
MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008                                                            37


   8.11.3. Standby/Recall Procedures.         During nights, weekends, and federal
   holidays/authorized down days, the duty forecaster will implement SWAP by notifying the
   SWAT standby member by home phone or cell phone whenever one or more conditions in
   Table 8.4 are met to determine if the SWAT is to be activated: (Note: Current contact
   numbers can be found on the recall roster. Contact numbers will be reviewed monthly and
   updated when necessary.)

Table 8.4. Conditions Requiring Notification/Activation of SWAT Standby Member.
                                                                      Desired Notification/

 *F. Heavy Rain (Rain > 2 inches in < 12 hours)                            120 minutes
3. In the event of unforeseen circumstances, such as a communications line failure, a
critical equipment outage at either the 26 OWS or CWF, the CWF will implement the
SWAP at the request of 26 OWS. The 26 OWS, as the agency ultimately responsible for
forecast watch/warning support, will have this prerogative in the interest of MacDill AFB
resource protection and flight safety.
4. Any other event or situation that the duty forecaster deems notification necessary.

   8.11.4. Activation. The duty forecaster will discuss the meteorological situation, manning
   requirements, and the recall of additional personnel (or place on standby) with the SWAT
   member. (If a SWAT member is unavailable, coordinate with the CWF Flight Chief, or
   CWF NCOIC.) If deemed necessary, the SWAT member will report to the weather station as
   soon as possible after notification by the duty forecaster. Once the SWAT member has

        8.11.4.2. Weather personnel will augment the FMQ-19. If required, manual observations
        will be taken, recorded, and disseminated according to AFMAN 15-111,
        MACDILLAFBI 15-101, MOA 15-54, and local procedures.
     8.11.5. Post Event Procedures. If severe weather actually occurs, the following procedures
     will be executed if necessary.
        8.11.5.1. OPREP-3 BEELINE Reporting procedures. When the following severe
        weather occurs: Wind > 50 knots, Hail > 3/4 inch, and/or Tornados, provide the
        information in Attachment 6 to the 6th Air Mobility Wing Command Post. This
        information needs to be provided regardless of the occurrence of damage.
        8.11.5.2. If the event is to be used as one of the semiannual SWAP tests, complete a
        memorandum for record documenting the event. Also contact 26 OWS flight leadership
        and provide them with the memorandum or an e-mail for their records.
        8.11.5.3. 6 OSS CWF personnel home phone numbers, cell phone numbers, and pager
        numbers will be reviewed quarterly or when a change in personnel occurs to ensure the
        most current numbers are available for SWAP.
     8.11.6. 26 OWS Responsibilities. 26 OWS will perform the OWS SWAP responsibilities as
     defined in 26 OWS CONUS Operations Standing Operating Procedure, Severe Weather
     Action Procedures. 26 OWS will accomplish the following procedures when severe weather
     is determined likely:
        8.11.6.1. Activate the SWAT to include: Lead Forecaster In Charge (LFIC), Site-
        Support Forecaster, WSR 88D(OPUP) Operator (as required), and the Product
        Coordinator/SWAT Assistant (as required).
        8.11.6.2. The LFIC will contact 26 OWS flight leadership and discuss the meteorological
        situation, manning requirements, and recall personnel (or place on standby) as directed by
        the leadership. If neither the commander nor NCOIC are available, coordinate with the
        Shift Supervisor.
        8.11.6.3. Unless otherwise stated, have the CWF SWAT recalled not later than 4 hours
        before the expected occurrence of severe weather. Be prepared to conduct a METCON
        with the CWF SWAT when they arrive at their base weather station.
        8.11.6.4. Intensify METWATCH.
        8.11.6.5. Review watch/warning criteria for MacDill AFB. Issue products as required.
        8.11.6.6. If the OWS is acting as the 6 OSS CWF, they will provide data to the
        Command Post (6 AMW/CP) for OPREP reporting purposes as outlined below in
        paragraph. 8.11.8
     8.11.7. Post Event Procedures. If severe weather actually occurs, accomplish the following:
        8.11.7.1. Notify 26 OWS flight leadership (if not already present).
        8.11.7.2. Examples include reports from local law enforcement and emergency
        management agencies, local news media, and supported CWFs.
        8.11.7.3. The 26 OWS SWAT leader will perform a ―data save‖ and provide all pertinent
        information to the 6 OSS CWF flight leadership. The flight leadership will compile the
MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008                                                                41


       information and provide a summary to 26 OWS/DO and 26 OWS/CC for further
       dissemination at their discretion.
       8.11.7.4. If 6 OSS CWF wishes to use the event as one of the semiannual SWAP tests,
       the 26 OWS flight leadership should ask the 6 OSS CWF leadership for a memorandum
       or e-mail for 26 OWS records.
   8.11.8. Severe Weather Damage Reporting/OPREPs. In the event of severe weather, in
   accordance with AFMAN 15-129, AFI 10-229, and AFI 10-206, the CWF will query base
   CWW agencies (SFS, Fire Dept, etc.), local spotters, and online damage assessment data
   sources (Tampa Bay region, Tampa NWS, local news, local law enforcement, etc.) to collect
   the area impacts of severe weather (on base or in the immediate surrounding areas) as time
   permits. Following a severe weather event in which winds of 50 knots or greater, hail 3/4
   inch or larger, or tornadoes occur, the 6 OSS CWF will provide 6 AMW/CP with the
   following information required for inclusion in an OPREP-3 report produced by 6 AMW/CC:
       8.11.8.1. Actual severe weather experienced, along with any other pertinent information
       (damage reports, visual/radar tornadic confirmations, etc.).
       8.11.8.2. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) valid at the time of occurrence.
       8.11.8.3. Any watches, warnings, and/or advisories issued to include actual and desired
       lead-time.
       8.11.8.4. Operational status of meteorological equipment.
       8.11.8.5. The CP, in turn, will provide the CWF with a copy of any weather related
       OPREPs. The CWF will provide damage reports and OPREP-3s to the OWS and higher
       headquarters as soon as possible. Note: 6 AMW/CC is the releasing authority for
       OPREP-3s.
       8.11.8.6. 6 OSS CWF will notify and provide 26 OWS, HQ AMC/A36W, and AFWA
       CSFO (DSN 271-0004/Commercial 402-294-0004) of any OPREP-3 and severe weather
       reports immediately after fulfilling any local distribution requirement for post-analysis
       and verification. Request 26 OWS to provide required information, if needed, by
       performing a weather data save.
8.12. Hurricane/Tropical Storm Advisory Criteria. Hurricane/tropical storm advisories are
issued to alert using agencies of the potential for winds 50 knots (HURCON) or greater within
72, 48, 24, or 12 hours at MacDill AFB. These special advisories are based on the National
Hurricane Center (NHC) forecasts and outlined in AFI 10-2501. The NHC website is
http://www.nhc.noaa.gov. Information will include current storm location, movement, and
wind speeds along with forecast positions and wind speeds. When briefing AMW leadership,
there will be no deviations from the official NHC position, track, movement, maximum wind
speed, or intensity trend. Due to the uncertainty of the 72 and 48-hour outlooks, they should be
used for planning purposes only (96 and 120 hour forecast positions may also be provided).
NHC advisories (official forecast information) are the core of the CWF input to the Crisis Action
Team . NHC data, however, may be used to tailor MacDill forecast products (MEFs) with
special consideration being given to local terrain effects (friction, funneling, etc.). HURCON
definitions are as follows:
42                                                      MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008


     8.12.1. HURCON 4: 50 knots (kts)/58 miles per hour (mph) winds or higher within 72
     hours.
     8.12.2. HURCON 3: 50 kts/58 mph winds or higher within 48 hours.
     8.12.3. HURCON 2: 50 kts/58 mph winds or higher within 24 hours.
     8.12.4. HURCON 1: 50 kts/58 mph winds or higher within 12 hours.
8.13. Chemical Downwind Messages (CDM)/Effective Downwind Messages (EDM). The
CWF is the primary unit for providing CDM/EDM support. CDM bulletins can be produced in
station     but      are     also      available     on     the       OWS         website       at
https://ows.barksdale.af.mil/By_Type/text/
index.cfm?UID=&BW=H&UF=O&AOR=1&USEHF=1. They are used to determine the spread
of chemical and biological agents that are released. The EDM bulletin is produced by AFWA
twice a day based on 00Z and 12Z weather data and is used for forecasting threat areas for fallout
from a nuclear detonation. Lastly, per AFI 10-2501, the CWF is responsible for providing only
meteorological data towards the calculation of Toxic Corridor products. The OWS may also
supplement the CWF with this weather data-only support, if required. The Fire Department has
the primary responsibility for Toxic Corridor calculations with Bioenvironmental acting as a
backup.
MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008                                                                 43

                     WEATHER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION

9.1. General. Forecasts, observations, and weather alerts (warnings, watches, and advisories)
are useful only if the customers have access to them. Timely and efficient dissemination of
weather information is crucial to the success of the wing mission and resource protection. Most
organizations will receive this information via our primary dissemination system. Some
organizations will receive courtesy calls, however, AFI 10-229 restricts the CWF from directly
notifying (via telephone) more than 3 organizations in order to focus on incoming weather
phenomena.      This chapter describes the weather dissemination systems, dissemination
procedures, and back-up systems and procedures.
9.2. Dissemination and Back-up Systems.
   9.2.1. New Tactical Forecast System (NTFS). Currently the CWF uses NTFS as its primary
   method of disseminating observations, forecasts, warnings, watches, and advisories. The
   NTFS consists of a series of dedicated computer terminals in RAPCON, Tower, and the
   CWF connected through the base local area network (LAN) to the NTFS server. Other
   agencies requiring direct access to NTFS have NTFS Client software installed on a self-
   provided computer. Agencies without an NTFS terminal will receive critical weather
   information through their unit’s own dissemination system (e.g., Pyramid Alert Recall, Unit
   Control Center, etc.). The CWF will follow documented backup dissemination procedures
   documented in the SOPs in the event that NTFS terminals are inoperative . NTFS terminals
   or Client software are installed in the following locations:
   9.2.2. Hotlines. Hotlines have been installed between the CWF and other agencies for the
   sole purpose of rapidly exchanging weather data. Normal phone lines will be used in the
   event of a hotline outage. Hotlines are installed between the CWF and the following
   agencies (DSN Prefix 968-xxxx, Comm. 813-828-xxxx):
   9.2.3. Climatic Data Requests. Upon request from an authorized agency (as deemed
   appropriate by station management), provide climatology data for MacDill AFB and other
   locations. Request may be made by phone, e-mail, letter, or in person.
9.3. Dissemination and Back-Up Procedures.
   9.3.1. TAFs. TAFs will be entered and disseminated through NTFS as described in Chapter
   4. If the NTFS is out of service, the CWF will disseminate the information locally via
   standard telephone lines to the Command Post, tower, and RAPCON.
   9.3.2. Observations. Observations will be taken and disseminated through the NTFS as
   described in Chapter 3. When the NTFS is out of service, observations will be disseminated
   long-line through the Joint Air Force and Army Weather Information Network (JAAWIN).
   If all long-line transmission resources are out of service, call via telephone (voice relay) to
   any other weather station or supporting hub for long-line transmission. Locally, observations
   will be relayed by the CWF to the following organizations (noted on a local dissemination
   log) in order of priority when the NTFS is out of service:
       9.3.2.1. Tower (Hotline)1.
44                                                       MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008


        9.3.2.2. RAPCON (Commercial 813-878-2528/813-371-7750).
        9.3.2.3. Command Post (Hotline, as requested).
        9.3.2.4. Base Operations (same building as the CWF; verbally when the airfield is open,
        as requested).
Note 1: See paragraph 9.2.2. for a list of hotlines and associated phone numbers.
     9.3.3. WBGT. The Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight has primary responsibility for
     obtaining WBGT with the CWF as their backup. In the event the CWF has to perform this
     function, the CWF will disseminate the WBGT to the Command Post via hotline. This
     information will be further disseminated by the Command Post to all required agencies.
     9.3.4. Weather Watches, Warnings, and Advisories. Weather watches, warnings, and
     advisories will be disseminated via the NTFS (see paragraph 9.2.1 for a list of the
     organizations). When warnings are issued, the 26 OWS or CWF (depending on who issued
     the warning) will give a courtesy call to the Command Post. The CWF will contact the
     Command Post and the 26 OWS MacDill forecaster when advisories are issued. If the NTFS
     is out of service, the 26 OWS and/or CWF will contact the same organizations, as well as the
     Tower via telephone. Further dissemination by Base Operations and the Command Post is as
     follows:
        9.3.4.1. Base Operations. Base Operations relays all weather warnings via telephone to
        the following organizations (landlines are used for backup purposes):
        9.3.4.2. Command Post. The 6 AMW/CP disseminates all weather watches, warnings,
        and advisories by telephone and LAN. The Command Post calls the following agencies:
        9.3.4.3. Tornado Warnings. The Command Post has the primary responsibility for
        sounding the base siren in the event of a Tornado Warning issuance.
        9.3.4.4. Lightning Warnings. All lightning warnings are disseminated to the base
        populace via the Giant Voice and/or LAN systems, allowing all members on base to be
        prepared for inclement weather. Lightning warnings are also disseminated via NTFS.
9.4. Base Warning Notification Pyramid Structure Diagrams. Per AFI 10-229, the
following diagram shows how weather watches/warnings are sent through the wing.

                                           Chapter 10

                                  WEATHER EQUIPMENT

10.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the CWF. Additionally, it provides information on back-up
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
10.2. Meteorological Equipment. The CWF uses a wide range of equipment to determine the
current state of the atmosphere. These critical systems are used continuously to provide
customers the most timely, accurate, and relevant weather intelligence possible.
   10.2.1. FMQ-19. The FMQ-19 is an integrated weather system consisting of multiple
   weather sensors and information technology components that continually measure the
   environment near the surface of the earth. It automatically generates surface aviation
   weather observations based on user-defined events, either by time or occurrence of a
   particular weather element or category. The FMQ-19 is the primary source for elements of
   the official observation. The backup for the FMQ-19 consists of the Kestrel 4000
   10.2.2. Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) (OPUP). Also known as the WSR-88D Next
   Generation Radar, the NEXRAD is a Doppler weather system. The Internet provides the
   CWF backup radar information. Control of the NEXRAD site belongs to the National
   Weather Service office in Tampa Bay (Ruskin), FL.
10.3. Communications Equipment. Just as vital as meteorological equipment,
communications equipment allows the CWF to get the right information to the right customer.
The following systems are the backbone of the CWF communications network.
   10.3.1. NTFS. As discussed in Chapter 9, this is our primary system for disseminating
   forecasts, observations, warnings, watches, and advisories. Telephones are used as a backup
   for key aircraft controlling agencies.
   10.3.2. PMSV Radio. The Pilot-To-Metro-Service Radio (344.6 MHz) allows the CWF to
   communicate with aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as tower personnel. If the
   PMSV is out of service, aircrews can contact the 26 OWS via phone patch (where possible)
   to get weather data.
   10.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines primarily serve as backup system as well as
   for passing along critical, time-sensitive information rapidly.
   10.3.4. LAN. The CWF relies heavily on the local area network to improve the timeliness
   and accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers. All information can be obtained
   through other methods (e.g., satellite imagery, lightning data, etc.), but is far less efficient.
10.4. Maintenance. All equipment requires some sort of maintenance from time to time. The
following organizations provide preventive maintenance and repair weather and communications
equipment:
10.5. Restoring Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems have been established in the
event natural disasters or any other anomaly simultaneously impact systems base-wide. The
48                                                    MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008


priorities for weather equipment are listed below (priorities may be adjusted based on incoming
weather):
10.6. Building Power. Hangar 3 is equipped with a back-up generator. The generator should
start up automatically when power is cut off to Hangar 3. 6 CES performs quarterly tests to
ensure the generator is working properly.
MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008                                                                49


                                          Chapter 11

                              OWS/CWF BACK-UP SUPPORT

11.1. General. There are dozens of scenarios that could cause an interruption of service from
either the 26 OWS or the CWF. This chapter briefly describes how weather services will be
provided should any such events occur.
11.2. 26 OWS. Per MOA 15-54, when weather operations at 26 OWS are interrupted (e.g.,
power outage, natural disaster, etc.), associated TAF, weather watch and warning responsibility
will be transferred to CWF until such time 26 OWS is postured to resume operations. Other 26
OWS weather information responsibilities (e.g., graphical products) will be transferred to other
agencies as necessary to continue weather information to MacDill AFB.
11.3. CWF. For standard station evacuations, support will resume from the alternate operating
location site with the OWS assuming responsibilities during any interim period. For longer
interruptions, the CWF will coordinate required support with other organizations. Per MOA 15-
54, the 26 OWS will not normally produce and disseminate tactical-level weather products for
MacDill AFB mission execution. However, when operational constraints (e.g., deployment
operations significantly decrease manning) prevent the CWF from accomplishing the task, the 26
OWS may produce and disseminate selected tactical-level weather products (MEFs, verbal
discussions, faxed products, etc.) on a short-term basis. The CWF will coordinate the transfer of
this responsibility in advance with 26 OWS.
50                                                      MACDILLAFBI15-101 22 JULY 2008

   (in this case MacDill AFB).
   2. Type of observation. There are two types of observations as described below:
   A Metar Observation (METAR). An observation taken routinely in accordance with AFMAN
   15-111.
   B. Special Observation (SPECI). An observation taken as a result of one of the special criteria
   (listed in Attachment 4) being met.
   3. Time. This is the time, in Zulu, or GMT, that the last element of the observation was
   observed.
   4. Wind. This portion of the observation provides the wind direction (first 3 numbers, VRB for
   variable, or 000 for calm), sustained wind speed (next 2 or 3 numbers), and wind gusts (any
   numbers following the G, if there have been any) measured in knots. One knot equals 1.14 miles
   per hour.
   5. Visibility. The furthest predominant distance (at least 50% of the aerodrome) that can be seen
   from the airfield, reported in statute miles. The most common visibility reported is 7 miles.
   6. Present weather. Any weather phenomenon that is occurring on the airfield. This is
   mandatory anytime the visibility is less than 7 miles. The table below lists the present weather
   codes.
