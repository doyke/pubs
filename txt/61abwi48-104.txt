                SAMPLE EMPLOYEE INFORMATION AND TRAINING PLAN

A3.1. This document provides supervisory personnel with the training requirements for the Hazard Com-
munication (HAZCOM) program for all personnel assigned to this work area. Upon completion of this
training, personnel must update their AF Form 55 such training.

A3.2. Overview:
   A3.2.1. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued the Hazard Communica-
   tion Standard, which eventually became Title 29, CFR, 1910.1200, Hazard Communication. It states
   that every individual has the right to know what hazards are faced on the job and how to be protected
   against them. Air Force Instruction 90-821, Hazard Communication, outlines the Air Force program.
   A3.2.2. In 1983, OSHA issued the Hazard Communication Standard for manufacturing operations to
   help protect you. In 1987, OSHA revised this standard and expanded it to include all workplaces
   where personnel are exposed to hazardous chemicals.
   A3.2.3. The goal of the Hazard Communication Program is to reduce the incidence of occupational
   illness and injury caused by hazardous chemicals in the workplace.

A3.3. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) are located with the HAZCOM Program. All documents
(including the chemical inventory, non-routine task listing, and written plan) are contained in the
HAZCOM binder, located ____________________________________. Work area personnel are trained
on how to read material labels and MSDSs during technical training and initial work area orientation.
   A3.3.1. A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) contains nine major sections. The sections are divided
   as follows: Material Identification, Ingredients and Hazards, Physical Data, Fire and Explosion Data,
   Reactivity Data, Health Hazard Data, Spill and Disposal Methods, Special Protection Information,
   and Comments Section. All companies follow this standard format.
       A3.3.1.1. Section I contains the material identification and general information, like company
       name, address, material name with synonyms, and an emergency phone number.
       A3.3.1.2. Section II lists all hazardous ingredients in the chemical mixture. Many chemical mate-
       rials are mixtures. Not only does this section list the ingredients, but also states the percentages of
       each ingredient found in the total mixture. For example, acetic acid may contain two ingredients,
       water and acetic acid, where water makes up 72% of the mixture and 28% is acetic acid. This
       accounts for 100% of the mixture (72 + 28). Knowing percentages is helpful when an air sample
       is accomplished to determine the airborne concentration of the hazard.
       A3.3.1.3. Section III contains physical data. Physical data is characterized by appearance, odor, a
       boiling point, freezing point, vapor pressure, solubility, and specific gravity. The important data in
       this section are vapor pressure, and boiling point. For instance, methylene chloride has a boiling
       point of 39oC (102oF) and has a high vapor pressure. Because of these physical properties, an
       employee should be aware that this material must be stored in a cool, vented, and flame free envi-
       ronment.
       A3.3.1.4. Section IV provides data on fire and explosion information, such as what type of fire
       extinguishing media to use and whether or not any toxic vapors are released during a fire. If so, it
12                                                                          61ABWI48-104 3 JUNE 2008


        states the personal protective measures fire fighters should use. It is important that this section be
        reviewed prior to using the chemical.
        A3.3.1.5. Section V provides reactivity data. This section simply describes “what can be stored
        with what”. An example is storing acids with bases. You would not want to store sodium hydrox-
        ide (lye) in the same cabinet with sulfuric acid (battery acid), If one of those containers broke, it
        would react vigorously, neutralize your chemicals, and produce hydrogen gas. It could produce a
        dangerous situation.
        A3.3.1.6. Section VI contains health hazard information, emergency and first aid procedures. The
        data found in this section describe the route of entry (e.g., skin, eyes, respiratory) and the target
        organs or systems (e.g., liver, lungs, central nervous system) and first aid procedures.
        A3.3.1.7. Section VII provides information on the proper disposal of the material. This section
        tells you how to neutralize a chemical spill, how to dispose of the material, and who to contact if a
        spill occurs. Hazardous chemical wastes (flammable, toxic, etc.) cannot be poured down the drain
        or placed in the regular trash. Lastly, call 61 CELS/CEV (653-5494 or 653-5491) to coordinate
        removal and disposal of this waste.
        A3.3.1.8. Section VIII provides important information on specific personal protective equipment
        such as respiratory protection, rubber boots, or eye goggles. It also provides information on the
        necessity for engineering controls such as a ventilation system.
        A3.3.1.9. Section IX is used for any additional comments the manufacturer deems necessary for
        the user. The key is educating the user on the product to prevent injury or illness.

A3.4. A listing of all hazardous chemicals is provided as part of the HAZCOM Program. The actual
chemicals are stored in ___________________________________________.
     A3.4.1. The HAZCOM program requires the use of warning labels that contain the name and identity
     of the chemical, and appropriate hazard warnings.
     A3.4.2. Labels on containers that leave the work area must contain the name and address of the
     responsible party. The warning label is often your first source of information about chemical hazards.
     The name and identity on the label can be used to find the right MSDS, where you will find additional
     information.

A3.5. Workcenter HAZCOM Binder MSDSs provide the physical and health risks of each hazardous
chemical along with the signs and symptoms of overexposure and the method of determining the presence
or release of a hazardous material in the work area.

A3.6. Work area personnel reduce or prevent exposure to hazardous chemicals by using appropriate per-
sonal protective equipment (PPE) and by being familiar with the signs and symptoms of exposure to the
materials they are working with. Three basic methods for controlling chemical hazards are engineering
controls, personal protective equipment, and administrative controls.
     A3.6.1. Engineering controls include substitution, isolation, general ventilation, and local exhaust
     ventilation. Substitution applies when a chemical, process, or piece of equipment with fewer hazards
     can replace an existing one. Isolation refers to using an enclosure, barrier, or a safe distance to sepa-
     rate workers from the exposure hazard. Common examples of this are machine enclosures, enclosed
     control rooms, and splashguards. General ventilation is mixing an airborne hazard with fresh air to
61ABWI48-104 3 JUNE 2008                                                                              13


   reduce exposure levels. This only applies when hazards have low toxicity and mix readily with air.
   Some examples of general ventilation are fans and vents. Local exhaust ventilation captures an air-
   borne hazard as it is released and takes it out of the work area to eliminate the exposure.
   A3.6.2. Prioritizing how we control exposures is accomplished by looking at the source, path and
   receiver. Controlling the receiver is least desirable, but most often used. Personal protective equip-
   ment (PPE) is the most common means of protecting an individual against exposures (physical and
   health hazards). Some examples of PPE include gloves, aprons, eye and face protection, and respira-
   tors. To protect you, the PPE must be matched to the specific hazard. For example, cloth gloves are
   useless for protection against a corrosive liquid. Personal protective equipment is useless unless you
   wear it. Proper fit, correct use, and routine inspection are essential.
   A3.6.3. Administrative controls include documentation, information, and training in safe work prac-
   tices, good housekeeping, and most of all, monitoring. This applies to personnel and equipment. The
   Hazard Communication Program is an effective administrative control to ensure workers are informed
   on the work area hazards.

A3.7. Steps taken to reduce exposure. Steps are described in the BEE survey reports, located in Tab G of
the HAZCOM binder. The reports address PPE and administrative controls to reduce the risk of exposure
to all workers. Additionally, all personnel are provided HAZCOM training and are always discussing
potential situations as well as how to best deal with such situations.

A3.8. Work area personnel do/do not (circle appropriate word) use large quantities of hazardous materi-
als. Reference Attachment 4 for specific procedures.

A3.9. Supervisors may use the following review questions to test workers’ knowledge of the Hazard
Communication Program.
