        1.4.5.3. The commanding officer or officer in charge of any other DoD organization investigates
        incidents within that commander's jurisdiction.
     1.4.6. Staffing Responsibilities. Because prompt and efficient claims response is a command
     responsibility, particularly in major disaster situations, SJAs ensure their claims operations are prop-
     erly staffed to handle the claims workload.
     1.4.7. Specially Assigned Claims Responsibilities:
        1.4.7.1. Assigned Claims Statutes. The DoD assigns single-service responsibility for process-
        ing and settling claims for and against the United States in certain countries under the Federal
        Medical Care Recovery Act (FMCRA).
        1.4.7.2. Claims Statutes Not Assigned. The DoD does not assign single-service responsibility
        for the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act.
        1.4.7.3. Countries Assigned to the Air Force. The SJA responsible for claims within a geo-
        graphic area ensures that claims personnel correctly process, settle, or collect all FMCRA claims
        that the military departments or the DoD generate. Note: See AFI 51-501, Tort Claims, for infor-

  1.5.5. DELETED.
     1.5.5.1. Claims personnel when paying approved claims prepare vouchers or other payment doc-
     uments in sufficient copies to:
        1.5.5.1.1. Satisfy the requirements of the local accounting and finance office (AFO) or the

     ment kept with the log.
     1.5.5.8. Two-Person Policy. When possible, one person investigates a claim, prepares the
     report, and recommends the action. The settlement authority, a second individual, then approves
     or disapproves the recommended action.
     EXCEPTION: If not possible because of staffing, one person with the authority to act as a claims
     officer and a settlement authority may investigate and act upon a claim. Use this practice spar-
     ingly. In addition, see paragraph 1.2.7.2.
        1.5.5.8.1. Because separating claims processing responsibilities removes the possibility of
        fraud and abuse and prevents a perceived lack of impartiality, the settlement authority avoids
        delegating authority to only one person in the office to process the claim from investigation
        through approval.
     1.5.5.9. Reporting Serious or Unusual Incidents. When a serious or unusual incident involv-
     ing claims occurs, the base SJA uses the JAG Accident Incident Report (RCS: HAF-JA[AR]
     8302) to report the incident to the supervisory GCM, MAJCOM, and either AFLSA/JACC or
     AFLSA/ JACT.
        1.5.5.9.1. The base SJA reports aviation accidents and other incidents involving potential tort
        liability to AFLSA/ JACT. Reportable incidents also include:
        1.5.5.9.2. Severe weather disasters, floods, fires, and other incidents involving loss of or dam-
        age to personal property, which require expert advice, assistance, or numerous emergency par-
        tial payments are reported to AFLSA/JACC.
        1.5.5.9.3. Reportable incidents also include:
            1.5.5.9.3.1. Incidents and (UCMJ, DoD, or other) investigations of fraud, waste or abuse
            in claims.
            1.5.5.9.3.2. Incidents with claims aspects that may receive widespread media coverage.
            1.5.5.9.3.3. Base closures or other actions requiring claims jurisdiction transfers or juris-
            diction arrangements different from the maps that AFLSA/JACC has distributed to the
            field.
        1.5.5.9.4. The SJA makes reports using the quickest means possible and follows up with a
        written report within 24 hours. The SJA includes:
            1.5.5.9.4.1. An estimate of the number of potential claims and the amount of damage.
            1.5.5.9.4.2. Information on any claims team response to the scene and the estimated or
            actual arrival time.
            1.5.5.9.4.3. Request for parent command, other command, or AFLSA/JACC assistance, if
            necessary.
            1.5.5.9.4.4. Any other pertinent information.

                                                Chapter 2

        PERSONNEL CLAIMS UNDER THE MILITARY PERSONNEL AND CIVILIAN
                          EMPLOYEES' CLAIMS ACT

Section 2A—General

2.1. Scope. Claims personnel follow these rules for settling claims of active-duty Air Force members
and Air Force civilian employees for loss, damage, or destruction of personal property incident to their
service.

2.2. Authority. The Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act (the Personnel Claims
Act), 31 U.S.C. 3701, 3721, is the authority for settling claims under this chapter (referred to as personnel
claims).

2.3. Purpose. The Personnel Claims Act is a gratuitous payment statute. It does not provide insurance
coverage and is not designed to make the United States a total insurer of the personal property of claim-
ants. Payment does not depend on tort liability or Government fault. Congress instead determined to
lessen the hardships of military life by providing prompt and fair payment for certain types of property
loss or damage, especially those caused by frequent moves. The Air Force aims, within approved guide-
lines, to compensate active-duty members and civilian employees for property loss or damage to the max-
imum extent possible.

2.4. Maximum Payment. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3721b, the maximum payment that settlement
authorities can make under the Personnel Claims Act for loss or damage resulting from a single incident
is $40,000.
   2.4.1. Settlement authorities cannot waive this statutory limitation.
   EXCEPTION: An amendment to 31 U.S.C. 3721b(1) allows payment of more than $40,000, but not
   more than $100,000, if the claim arose from an emergency evacuation or from extraordinary circum-
   stances. Base settlement authorities are not authorized to settle claims for more than of $40,000. If
   the adjudicated value of a claim exceeds $40,000, the base settlement authority pays the claimant the
   $40,000 for his claim, and then forwards the claim to AFLSA/JACC for a determination as to whether
   the claim arose from an emergency evacuation or extraordinary circumstance.
   2.4.2. Title 10, United States Code, Section 2738, allows a service secretary to reimburse a service
   member up to $100,000 for the loss of household effects sustained during a change of permanent sta-
   tion when the secretary determines the loss was caused by hostile action by a military force. The
   reimbursement covers the losses not reimbursed by insurance or the Personnel Claims Act. Although
   the effective date of the section is 5 October 1994, it applies to losses incurred after 30 June 1990.
   These claims are processed under the procedures for Military Claims Act.

2.5. Finality. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3721k, Air Force administrative settlement of personnel
claims is final and conclusive.
   2.5.1. Claimants do not have a right to sue.
24                                                                             AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


2.6. Paying Claims Under Other Claims Statutes. Settlement authorities pay any claim payable
under the Personnel Claims Act, but also payable under other claims statutes (such as the Military Claims
Act or the Federal Tort Claims Act), in accordance with this chapter.
     2.6.1. If a claim is not payable under the Personnel Claims Act and this chapter, settlement authori-
     ties:
        2.6.1.1. onsider it under any other claims statute that applies before disapproving it.
        2.6.1.2. If appropriate, investigate and settle the claim in accordance with the applicable statute.
     2.6.2. If a claim is cognizable (that is, warrants consideration), but not payable under either the Per-
     sonnel Claims Act or another claims statute, settlement authorities cite both statutes as the basis for
     denial in the settlement letter to the claimant.

2.7. Handling Personal Injury Claims. In certain cases, if a claim alleges both property damage pay-
able under this chapter and personal injury cognizable under a tort claim statute, settlement authorities
may find it appropriate to split the property damage from the tort claim and pay it as a personnel claim.

2.8. Handling Claims Resulting From Negligent Acts of Contractor Personnel. Refer personnel
claims that result primarily from the fault or negligence of a Government contractor to the contractor or
its insurer, through the base contracting officer, for settlement.
EXCEPTION: Claims personnel do not refer claims resulting from the fault or negligence of a common
carrier or a warehouse firm to the contractor or its insurer.
     2.8.1. The claims office makes every effort to assist the claimant in obtaining payment from the con-
     tractor or its insurer.
        2.8.1.1. If the contractor does not immediately resolve the matter, the claims office coordinates
        with the contracting officer to setoff money due under the contract and pay it to the claimant under
        the terms of the contract.
     2.8.2. If the parties involved cannot resolve the matter without unacceptable delay, settlement author-
     ities may settle the claim under this chapter, if it otherwise qualifies for payment as a personnel claim.
        2.8.2.1. Authorities pursue the contractor under the terms of the contract to recover the claimant's
        award.

2.9. Handling Claims by Nonappropriated Fund Personnel. Although the Personnel Claims Act
does not provide for paying the claims of NAFI employees, settlement authorities adjudicate and settle
personnel claims of such employees under this chapter, but pay them from nonappropriated funds. (See
paragraph 1.4.8.)

2.10. Assessing Claims. Before paying for the loss, damage, or destruction of property, the settlement
authority verifies that:
     2.10.1. A valid claim exists (Section 2B).

          2.17.2.4.3. The claimant's storage entitlement at Government expense expires.
          2.17.2.4.4. A contractor at Government expense delivers the claimant's personal property out

Section 2E—Payable Claims (Loss or Damage Incident to Service)

2.29. Definition. The Personnel Claims Act limits payment to loss or damage that is "incident to ser-
vice," a broad term that covers such aspects of military living as frequent movements in response to
orders, assignment to quarters, and duty in foreign countries.

2.30. Civilian Employees. For personnel transportation claims, "incident to service" means the same
for civilian employees as for military members. However with one exception (see below), the Air Force
does not consider most other types of personnel claims or loss or damage unconnected with the perfor-
mance of duty (particularly loss or damage occurring outside duty hours and away from the workplace) as
incident to a civilian employee's service, even though it might consider the same loss or damage to be
incident to a military member's service.
EXCEPTION: When civilian employees are assigned with the Air Force outside the United States,
including quarters in US territories and possessions, settlement authorities pay for loss or damage from
fire, flood, hurricane, or other unusual occurrence, or from theft or vandalism that occurs at quarters,
including authorized off-base quarters, or other authorized places. See paragraph 2.33.3. special criteria
that apply to claims of civilian employees outside the United States.

2.31. Government-sponsored Transportation or Storage. Settlement authorities pay for property loss
or damage incident to transportation or storage at Government expense, whether the property was in the

     after Government entitlement to storage ends.
        2.31.1.1. When a claimant is entitled to file a claim for delivery out of storage at Government
        expense after a period of both Government storage and storage at the claimant's expense, attribute
        any loss or damage to storage at Government expense.
        EXCEPTION: Settlement authorities may attribute the loss or damage otherwise, if specific evi-
        dence exists of when the loss or damage occurred.
     2.31.2. Claimants receive an incentive payment for a "do-it-yourself" (DITY) move but do their own
     packing, loading, transporting, off-loading, and unpacking of the property.
        2.31.2.1. Settlement authorities pay only for loss or damage to property during a DITY move
        resulting from events outside claimant's control.
     2.31.3. Settlement authorities pay for shipment-related loss or damage to mobile homes shipped at
     Government expense. (See Section 2P)

ing military duty or in compliance with travel orders.
   2.32.1. Pay for incidents that occur while the claimant is awaiting transportation, such as the theft of
   luggage at an airline terminal. Note: As a general rule, the Air Force considers travel to be in the per-
   formance of military duty, if the Government reimburses the claimant for it.
   2.32.2. Pay for loss of or damage to checked luggage or hand-carried property in permissive TDY
   cases only when the claimant is traveling on a military conveyance.
   2.32.3. Pay for loss of or damage to checked luggage or hand-carried property, if the claimant or the
   claimant's dependents are traveling on a military conveyance in a space available status using military
   leave orders.
   2.32.4. Pay for loss of or damage to property that the claimant or the claimant's dependents moved, if
   they were traveling PCS under orders to a new duty station and did not deviate from a direct route.
   Note: The dependents need not be traveling with the claimant.

       2.33.5.1. Any place on a military installation.
       2.33.5.2. Any office, building, recreation area, or real estate that the Air Force or any other DoD
       element uses or controls.
       2.33.5.3. Any other place that the Government authorizes or apparently authorizes for receiving

2.34. Extraordinary Hazards. Because the Personnel Claims Act is not a substitute for insurance, set-
tlement authorities pay for loss or damage at quarters and other authorized places only if caused by fire,
flood, hurricane, or other unusual occurrence or by theft or vandalism. In these cases, the Personnel
Claims Act only provides protection from extraordinary hazards (violent acts of nature and other events
affecting the military installation that other members and employees do not face to the same degree, and
for the intentional torts of theft and vandalism, which might or might not have a strong service connec-
tion).
     2.34.1. Pay for loss or damage caused by fires, regardless of whether the fire was caused by an act of
     God or by a human agency, such as faulty wiring or arson.
     EXCEPTION: Do not pay for fire loss or damage caused by the wrongful or negligent conduct of the
     claimant.
        2.34.1.1. Potential claimants must maintain their quarters and supervise small children to mini-
        mize the risk of fire.
        2.34.1.2. Settlement authorities are not bound by a police report or report of survey stating that the
        claimant was not negligent, but must reach an independent conclusion based on all the evidence.
        Note: See paragraph 2.61. for fires caused by the negligent conduct of a claimant's family
        members or house guests. See paragraph 2.7. if personal injury also results from fire.
     2.34.2. Pay for loss or damage due to flooding caused by weather conditions or burst pipes in quar-
     ters.
     2.34.3. In deciding whether hazards are outside the normal risks of day-to-day living and working
     and, therefore, are unusual occurrences, settlement authorities consider two types of events (not con-
     tinuous conditions):
        2.34.3.1. Those of a very unusual nature.
        2.34.3.2. Those of a common nature that occur to an unexpected degree of severity.
            2.34.3.2.1. Settlement authorities pay for loss or damage from:
                2.34.3.2.1.1. Violent natural events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes,
                or volcanic eruptions, that are unanticipated and over which no one has any control.
                2.34.3.2.1.2. Storms of extreme intensity that cause damage to an unexpected degree of
                severity.
                2.34.3.2.1.3. Power surges affecting electrical or electronic devices, when lightning has
                actually struck the claimant's residence or objects outside the residence, such as the trans-
                former box.
                2.34.3.2.1.4. Power surges affecting electrical or electronic devices, when power company
                records or similar evidence show that a particular residence or group of residences was
                subjected to a power surge of unusual intensity.
                2.34.3.2.1.5. Power outages of enough length to spoil food.
                2.34.3.2.1.6. The falling of a large tree or a significant portion of one.
                2.34.3.2.1.7. A suddenly occurring, substantial defect in a building.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                    35


             2.34.3.2.1.8. Infestation by termites, other insects, or rodents, especially if the installation
             is aware of the problem and has not taken effective action to correct it. (See paragraph
             2.34.3.2.)
     2.34.3.3. Settlement authorities do not pay for damage or loss from:
         2.34.3.3.1. Routine or regularly occurring storms.
         2.34.3.3.2. Ice and snow sliding off a roof onto a vehicle or object.
         2.34.3.3.3. Falling branches or sap settling on vehicles.
         2.34.3.3.4. Minor deficiencies in buildings.
         2.34.3.3.5. Infestation by termites, other insects, or rodents in areas where such infestation is
         common, well-known, and individuals can take effective precautions. (See paragraph
         2.34.3.1.)
         2.34.3.3.6. Vehicle collisions, including those with deer or other animals and objects such as
         shopping carts.
         2.34.3.3.7. Gradual deterioration of furniture and other items due to climatic conditions, such
         as cracking or shrinkage of wooden panels in an extremely dry area.
     2.34.3.4. The following situations do not warrant payment as unusual occurrences, but should
     instead be investigated as torts:
         2.34.3.4.1. Spotting, etching, discoloration, or other damage allegedly caused by airborne
         chemicals or other discharges from Air Force or contractor activities. EXCEPTION: Con-
         sider the discharge to be an unusual occurrence only when investigation reveals that unusual
         weather conditions caused it.
         2.34.3.4.2. Paint overspray that the Government causes through negligence. Note: When
         contractor personnel cause the overspray, settlement authorities follow paragraph 2.8.
         2.34.3.4.3. Balls "escaping" from ball fields and golf courses and rocks thrown up by lawn
         mowers, weed-eaters, or vehicles.
         2.34.3.4.4. Damage to moving vehicles caused by defects or foreign objects in the roadway.
  2.34.4. Theft. Settlement authorities pay for the intentional, wrongful taking of someone else's
  property, including theft of or from vehicles, that occurs at quarters or at other authorized places (see
  paragraph 2.33.4.), during official duty or TDY.
     2.34.4.1. Settlement authorities:
         2.34.4.1.1. Pay for the theft of property from locked gymnasium, golf course, or bowling alley
         lockers, or other lockers at similar, authorized places.
         2.34.4.1.2. Pay only for items and amounts that are reasonable under the circumstances.
         2.34.4.1.3. Limit payments to $100 for loss of cash and $250 for cash and other items com-
         bined.
         EXCEPTION: Settlement authorities may waive this limitation in meritorious cases.
36                                                                          AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


            2.34.4.1.4. Pay personnel claims for locker theft from claims funds, rather than nonappropri-
            ated funds.
            EXCEPTION: Settlement authorities use nonappropriated funds, if the nonappropriated fund
            activity was negligent.
        2.34.4.2. Settlement authorities pay when evidence of a larceny, burglary, or housebreaking
        exists.
            2.34.4.2.1. A claimant who fails to report a theft immediately or as soon as practical may fail
            to prove that a theft occurred.
        2.34.4.3. Settlement authorities do not deny a claim because a thief has been identified. However,
        they do suspend payment if a good chance exists that the claimant can obtain payment for the loss
        or damage from the thief or other responsible person quickly and without undue burden.
     2.34.5. Robbery.
        2.34.5.1. Settlement authorities pay for the theft from a person by force, threat of bodily harm,
        snatching, or pickpocketing, if:
            2.34.5.1.1. The robbery occurs at quarters or other authorized places, during official duty or
            TDY.
            2.34.5.1.2. The claimant reports the robbery immediately (or as soon thereafter as practical) to
            police or command authorities.
        2.34.5.2. Pay for up to $200 in cash.
        EXCEPTION: Pay more than $200 if the claimant has a reasonable and believable explanation
        for carrying a greater amount.
     2.34.6. Loss of Money Delivered to an Agent of the United States. Settlement authorities pay for
     the loss of money delivered to Government personnel authorized or apparently authorized to accept
     funds.
     2.34.7. Vandalism. Settlement authorities pay for intentional damage to property, including vehicles
     at quarters and other authorized places (see paragraph 2.33.).
        2.34.7.1. Due to the mobility of vehicles, settlement authorities require a higher degree of inde-
        pendent evidence than in other cases to show that the vandalism actually occurred at quarters or an
        authorized place. Such evidence may consist of:
            2.34.7.1.1. Physical evidence verified by police report.
            2.34.7.1.2. A statement from a witness who either saw the vandalism or can confirm the vehi-
            cle's presence during the time period when it occurred.
            2.34.7.1.3. Other similar evidence.
        2.34.7.2. Settlement authorities do not deny a claim because the vandal has been identified. How-
        ever, they do suspend payment if a good chance exists that the claimant can obtain payment for the
        loss or damage from the vandal or other responsible person (such as the parent of a dependent van-
        dal) quickly and without undue burden.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                  37


   2.34.8. Disclaimers of Liability. In some cases, authorities post signs in areas or facilities on an
   installation disclaiming liability for theft, vandalism, or other loss or damage of property. In other
   cases, claimants who use MWRS facilities must sign agreements that MWRS or the Government will
   not be liable for property loss or damage. Although authorities may use such disclaimers to relieve a
   NAFI of responsibility for claims when the NAFI is not negligent, the disclaimers do not prevent
   claimants from making otherwise valid claims under the Personnel Claims Act.
       2.34.8.1. When authorities have relieved an NAFI of responsibility by a disclaimer, but the claim
       is payable as a personnel claim, settlement authorities pay it with appropriated funds.
       2.34.8.2. When an NAFI is negligent, settlement authorities process the claim as a tort claim pay-
       able with nonappropriated funds.
       2.34.8.3. Although disclaimers cannot bar valid claims, settlement authorities may consider the
       existence of a disclaimer as a factor in whether the claimant was negligent in leaving property
       without taking adequate precautions for its security.

2.35. Vehicles:
   2.35.1. Vehicles include:
       2.35.1.1. Automobiles.
       2.35.1.2. Motorcycles.
       2.35.1.3. Mopeds.
       2.35.1.4. Utility trailers and camping trailers.
       2.35.1.5. Trucks with mounted camper bodies.
       2.35.1.6. Motor homes.
       2.35.1.7. Boats and boat trailers.
       2.35.1.8. Aircraft.
          2.35.1.8.1. Mobile homes and other property used as dwelling places are not vehicles.
   2.35.2. Settlement authorities pay for the loss of or damage to vehicles:
       2.35.2.1. Shipped to, from, or between overseas areas or other areas at Government expense.
       EXCEPTION: Settlement authorities do not pay for damage that results from a mechanical
       defect.
       2.35.2.2. Properly located at quarters or other authorized places (see paragraph 2.33.), if the loss
       or damage results from fire, flood, hurricane, other unusual occurrence, theft, or vandalism.
       2.35.2.3. When the claimant was authorized by the Government to use the vehicle during military
       duty and the loss or damage did not result from a mechanical defect. Note: Claimants show their
       written orders to prove they were authorized to use the vehicle for Government business.
   2.35.3. Settlement authorities do not pay for loss or damage:
       2.35.3.1. Caused during shipment at the claimant's expense.
       2.35.3.2. While an agent of the claimant is moving the vehicle to or from the port.
38                                                                            AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


        2.35.3.3. Caused by a hit-and-run driver.
        2.35.3.4. Caused by theft or vandalism when inadequate evidence exists that the loss or damage
        occurred at quarters or an authorized place. (See paragraphs 2.34.4. and 3.34.7.)
        2.35.3.5. When the owner had intentionally failed to register or insure the vehicle in compliance
        with state laws or Air Force requirements.
        2.35.3.6. When the owner failed to register or insure the vehicle in compliance with state laws or
        Air Force requirements intended to prevent the loss or damage claimed.
        2.35.3.7. Caused by a structural failure of the vehicle or some other mechanical defect.
     2.35.4. If the vehicle is near the claims office, claims personnel inspect it when they receive a claim
     for loss or damage, or as soon afterwards as possible.
        2.35.4.1. Direct claimants to drive their vehicles, if operable, to the claims office for inspection.

2.36. Clothing and Other Items. Settlement authorities pay for loss of or damage to clothing and other
items worn on a military installation or during military duty, if caused by fire, flood, hurricane, other
unusual occurrence, theft, or vandalism.
     2.36.1. Pay only for clothing and other items that the Government did not supply.
     2.36.2. "Other items" include:
        2.36.2.1. Hearing aids.
        2.36.2.2. Eyeglasses.
        2.36.2.3. Items the claimant was carrying.
     2.36.3. If a civilian employee suffers damage to eyeglasses or other items, along with an injury, deter-
     mine whether the Federal Employees' Compensation Act will cover the property damage before pay-
     ing under this chapter.
     2.36.4. Uniforms. Claims personnel receive all claims involving military uniform items and first
     adjudicate both officer and enlisted member uniform claims under the Military Personnel and Civilian
     Employees' Claims Act and the provisions of this chapter. However, if payment is not appropriate
     under the claims statute, then only for enlisted member uniform items that are part of the enlisted
     clothing monetary allowance system (issue uniform items), claims personnel initiate consideration of
     reimbursement under the provisions and procedures of AFM 67-1, paragraph 75.
        2.36.4.1. Claims for enlisted issue uniform items which are nonpayable under the Military Per-
        sonnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act are accomplished on an AF Form 659, Personal Cloth-
        ing Claim, for processing under AFM 67-1.
        2.36.4.2. Organizational commanders or their designated representatives consider and approve or
        disapprove claims for enlisted issue uniform items under AFM 67-1 only if payment is not possi-
        ble under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act. All other types of enlisted
        uniform items, such as non-issue articles, and amounts of military clothing in excess of the
        enlisted clothing allowance are processed solely under the Military Personnel and Civilian
        Employees' Claims Act.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                    39


       2.36.4.3. Claims for enlisted issue uniform claims which are lost, stolen, or otherwise made unser-
       viceable may be considered under AFM 67-1 when:
          2.36.4.3.1. The loss occurs within the United States at an off-base location (residence) while
          the member is not on duty and is caused by fire, flood, hurricane, or other unusual occurrence,
          theft or vandalism.
          2.36.4.3.2. Items are made unfit or unsuitable for wear due to excessive changes in weight
          while under treatment of medical personnel and economic alterations at the government's
          expense are not feasible.
          2.36.4.3.3. Items are lost due to medical treatment or hospitalization.
          2.36.4.3.4. Enlisted members or officers (the one officer claim permitted under AFM
          67-1) return from prisoner of war status and need a standard initial issue of uniform items.
          2.36.4.3.5. Items are lost due to an Act of God or under other unusual circumstances.

2.37. Property Held as Evidence. If authorities must hold property belonging to the victim of a crime
as evidence for an extended time and the temporary loss or damage of the property is a hardship on the
victim, settlement authorities may pay a claim for the loss or damage.
   2.37.1. Settlement authorities do not pay a person suspected or accused of an offense for property
   seized as evidence from them.

2.38. Enemy Action, Hostile Acts, Confiscation, Evacuation, or Public Service. Settlement authori-
ties pay for loss or damage that results directly from:
   2.38.1. Enemy action or threat, including combat, guerrilla, or other belligerent activities, whether or
   not the United States was involved. This includes action to prevent capture or confiscation.
   2.38.2. Acts of mob violence, terrorist attacks, or other hostile acts directed against the United States,
   military members, or employees.
   2.38.3. Unjust confiscation of property belonging to Air Force members or employees by a foreign
   government or its nationals. The term "confiscation" includes situations in which an unjust change or
   application of foreign law forces surrender or abandonment of property.
   2.38.4. Action by the claimant in an attempt to:
       2.38.4.1. Stop a civil disturbance.
       2.38.4.2. Assist during a public disaster.
       2.38.4.3. Save a human life.
       2.38.4.4. Save Government property.

40                                                                            AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     2.39.1. For loss or damage that is not incident to the claimant's service. (See Section 2E)

     ant's agent. (See Section 2I)
     2.39.3. By subrogees or assignees.

        2.39.4.2. Claims for loss or damage that the Government could have recovered from a carrier,
        warehouse, or other Government-sponsored shipment or storage contractor.
            2.39.4.2.1. In presenting a claim, claimants assign their rights to collect from carriers and
            other contractors and must assist the Air Force in recovering from those sources.
            2.39.4.2.2. If a claimant prevents the Air Force from recovering loss or damage from a carrier
            or other contractor by cashing a settlement check, settlement authorities do not pay the claim-
            ant for any part of the loss or damage. (See Section 2L)

AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                   41


   2.39.14. That are fraudulent claims or misrepresented items. (See paragraph 2.54.)
NOTE: This list is not exclusive. Refer to applicable sections or paragraphs in this instruction for further
information where necessary.

Section 2G—Reasonable or Useful Property

2.40. Background. One of the basic restrictions of the Personnel Claims Act is that settlement authori-
ties may pay a claim only when the claimant's possession of the property was reasonable or useful under
the circumstances. (See 31 U.S.C. 3721f(2).)
   2.40.1. Under some circumstances, particular items serve no useful purpose and are not reasonable
   for a claimant to have. Some items that are perfectly reasonable to possess in quarters serve no useful
   purpose in the field or on TDY travel.

2.41. Personal Tools and Other Equipment Used to Perform Official Duties. Normally, Air Force
personnel do not have a reasonable need to use their personal tools and personal equipment for official
duties at the workplace.
   2.41.1. Privately owned personal computers are generally inappropriate for use in performing official
   duties.
   2.41.2. Settlement authorities pay for loss of or damage to personal tools and equipment only if the
   claimant used them to perform assigned tasks on a temporary basis with the authorization of the super-
   visor or commander, or the use was so brief or limited that it would not be reasonable to expect autho-
   rization.

2.42. Money. As a general rule, $200 cash on the person and $300 cash in quarters is the maximum rea-
sonable amount to possess.
EXCEPTION: The claimant had no opportunity to bank the excess or has a valid reason for possessing it.

2.43. Property Never Deemed Reasonable or Useful:
   2.43.1. Because the Air Force does not consider business property to be reasonable or useful for mil-
   itary service or employment, settlement authorities do not pay for property that claimants acquire and
   keep for resale, or for use in a private business or enterprise.
       2.43.1.1. Settlement authorities pay for items that claimants acquire for both personal and busi-
       ness use, if the business use is only occasional.
       EXCEPTION: Settlement authorities do not pay if the items are lost or damaged while the claim-
       ant is using them for business.
           2.43.1.1.1. Do not pay if the business use is substantial, or if the item occasionally used for
           business is designed for professional use and is not normally intended for personal use.
   2.43.2. Settlement authorities do not pay for contraband and other items that claimants illegally
   acquire, possess, or transport.
       2.43.2.1. Do not consider seizure by customs inspectors or other law enforcement personnel as
       loss or damage incident to service.
42                                                                          AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     2.43.3. Settlement authorities do not pay for items whose only purpose is to violate the law, such as
     radar detectors.

2.44. Overweight Shipments. Settlement authorities consider property lost or damaged in shipment at
Government expense to be lost or damaged incident to service, even if the shipment is overweight and the
claimant pays part of the shipping costs.

2.45. Quantities and Qualities of Property:
     2.45.1. Initially, settlement authorities do not consider quantities and qualities of property far in
     excess of what a claimant can use under the circumstances to be reasonable or useful.
        2.45.1.1. Claims personnel follow the military claims services' Allowance List - Depreciation
        Guide, which lists maximum allowable payments for certain items and categories of items. Apply
        the maximum allowable payments in adjudicating personnel claims.
        EXCEPTION: Do not use the guide for claims involving full replacement protection coverage.
     2.45.2. Staff Judge Advocates of Air Force bases and the Chief and branch chiefs, General Claims
     Division, may waive the maximum allowable payment limitations.
        2.45.2.1. The maximum allowable payment limitation may be waived in any amount up to
        the adjudicated value of the claimed item. If a staff judge advocate does not approve a waiver of
        the maximum allowable payment up to the adjudicated value:
            2.45.2.1.1. If the staff judge advocate feels that some amount greater than the maximum
            allowable limitation, but less than the amount claimed is payable, the staff judge advocate or a
            member of his staff may negotiate with the claimant in an effort to reach a compromise.
                2.45.2.1.1.1. No settlement may be agreed upon for any amount unless substantiation
                exists supporting that sum.
                2.45.2.1.1.2. The substantiation for the "negotiated" amount must be documented in the
                claims file.
                2.45.2.1.1.3. If a compromise is reached the claimant and the Staff Judge Advocate will
                sign a document containing the compromise. This document will also be kept as part of
                the claim file.
            2.45.2.1.2. If the staff judge advocate determines no payment should be made in excess of the
            maximum allowable, or if a compromise cannot be reached with the claimant:
                2.45.2.1.2.1. The claim payment is processed (with or without a payment exceeding the
                item's maximum allowable), then the claim file is forwarded to the General Claims Divi-
                sion for reconsideration. In the forwarding letter, the staff judge advocate should indicate
                why waiver is not warranted, or that a compromise could not be reached.
        2.45.2.2. The staff judge advocate may not delegate the authority to approve a waiver of the max-
        imum allowable payment.
     2.45.3. The Air Force recognizes that the maximum allowable amounts may not be appropriate in all
     cases. In determining whether to approve a waiver of maximum allowable payments, staff judge
     advocate should consider:
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                 43


       2.45.3.1. The extent to which the claimant provided evidence of ownership and the value of the
       property.
       2.45.3.2. The circumstances surrounding the claimant's ownership of more than average quanti-
       ties or better qualities of goods.
       2.45.3.3. The actual circumstances surrounding the loss or damage.

Section 2H—Evidence Supporting Claims

2.46. Background. The Personnel Claims Act requires support of claims. (See 31 U.S.C. 3721(f)(1).)
   2.46.1. For settlement authorities, the key to determining whether a claimant is entitled to payment is
   to assess whether the claimant provides evidence:
       2.46.1.1. That the loss or damage occurred.
       2.46.1.2. Of the value of that loss or damage.

2.47. Required Evidence.
   2.47.1. While no set rule exists as to how much proof claimants must provide, claims personnel may
   require them to provide:
       2.47.1.1. A purchase receipt or other evidence to confirm the value of items for which more than
       $250 is claimed.
       2.47.1.2. Evidence of ownership when claiming missing items that movers would normally have
       listed on an inventory, but did not.
       2.47.1.3. A repair estimate for internal damage to an item or for all other damage to an item for
       which the claimant claims more than $100.
   2.47.2. Claims personnel do not follow these standards rigidly, but consider:
       2.47.2.1. The documentary evidence that the claimant provides.
       2.47.2.2. The timeliness of the report of loss or damage.
       2.47.2.3. The overall credibility of the claimant.

2.48. Documentary Evidence. Claims personnel adjudicate most claims by reviewing the documentary
evidence that claimants supply. Note: These documents vary considerably in reliability.
   2.48.1. Claims personnel use the inventory as their most important document in evaluating a person-
   nel transportation claim and demonstrating tender of items to the carrier.
       2.48.1.1. Consider preexisting damage listed on the inventory, and any discrepancies between the
       description of the item on the inventory and the item claimed.
       2.48.1.2. Analyze the inventory with the claim form and DD Form 1840/1840R.
   2.48.2. In some cases, a statement by the claimant may be the only evidence available. Claims per-
   sonnel:
       2.48.2.1. Give weight to such a statement, based on the claimant's credibility.
44                                                                           AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


        2.48.2.2. Analyze credibility in light of all facts and the claim as a whole.
        2.48.2.3. Require the claimant to provide a sworn statement in appropriate cases.
     2.48.3. Claims personnel may ask claimants for purchase receipts and prior appraisals as the best evi-
     dence to show the ownership and value of a missing item. Note: While such documentary evidence
     by itself may not prove that tender took place, it may provide evidence of tender in combination with
     other circumstances.
     2.48.4. Claims personnel view estimates, paid bills, and subsequent appraisals as the best evidence to
     show replacement or repair cost, but must use caution in assessing this evidence.
        2.48.4.1. Remember that an estimate from a person who is not in the business of repairing or sell-
        ing that particular type of property may be worthless.
        2.48.4.2. Weigh cautiously any estimate prepared by someone who did not even examine the item.
     2.48.5. Claims personnel may use photographs and videotapes as:
        2.48.5.1. Excellent evidence of ownership and value.
        2.48.5.2. Possible proof of tender.
     2.48.6. For cases in which the police made an independent inquiry, claims personnel may use a police
     report instead of an inspection to help determine whether a claimant was negligent.
        2.48.6.1. The claims office must independently determine whether the claimant was negligent and
        does not merely repeat a police officer's conclusions.

2.49. Prompt Reporting of Loss or Damage.
     2.49.1. Claimants should report:
        2.49.1.1. Loss or damage promptly.
        2.49.1.2. Theft and vandalism to police authorities immediately upon discovery, or at the latest
        within 24 hours.
     2.49.2. Claimants list missing inventory items and obvious damage at the time of property delivery on
     DD Form 1840. They list missing items or damage discovered up to 70 days after delivery on DD
     Form 1840R.
     2.49.3. When picking up a shipped vehicle, claimants list loss or damage on DD Form 788, Private
     Vehicle Shipping Document for Automobile.
     2.49.4. Settlement authorities do not pay for obvious external damage that is not timely listed on DD
     Form 1840, DD Form 1840R, or DD Form 788.
     EXCEPTION: Settlement authorities may still pay if the claimant reports the damage to a shipped
     vehicle to claims personnel within a reasonable time (30 days) after arriving at the installation and
     provides the claims office with an opportunity to inspect the vehicle.
        2.49.4.1. In cases of concealed mechanical damage, claims personnel request a repairer's opinion
        as to whether damage could be shipment-related or is normal wear and tear.

2.50. Proving Tender of Items Not Listed on the Inventory:
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                    45


   2.50.1. Claimants asserting that items unlisted on the inventory (that would ordinarily appear on a
   well-prepared inventory) are missing from a shipment must provide purchase receipts or other evi-
   dence of ownership, such as photographs and additional solid evidence of tender, to prove that the
   items existed and were shipped. Additional evidence of tender could include a sworn statement by the
   member in appropriate cases, or statements by others who saw the items at pickup or shortly before.
   2.50.2. If the claim is for damage to an item not listed on the inventory, the presence of the item in the
   claimant's quarters, together with an annotation of the damage on the DD Form 1840 proves tender.
   The presence of the item in the claimant's quarters, along with annotation of the damage on the DD
   Form 1840R, may prove tender, depending on the circumstances. Claims personnel consider the type
   of item, the number of shipments, and other relevant factors to exclude other possibilities, such as the
   possibility that the claimant personally carried the item to the quarters.

2.51. Inspections. In order to determine the appropriate payment for damage, claims personnel, when
possible, examine items closely (especially in large claims) to determine the nature of the damage.

2.52. Failure to Prove a Claim. Settlement authorities do not pay a claimant who cannot show that loss
or damage occurred as alleged, or that it was incident to service.

2.53. Insufficient Proof of Quantity or Quality. When a claim is for an excessive quantity or quality
of property, but claims personnel cannot prove fraud, they deny or reduce the claim, based on the claim-
ant's failure to support the quantity or quality claimed.

2.54. Fraud.
   2.54.1. When claimants seek payment for loss or damage under a gratuitous payment statute, such as
   the Personnel Claims Act, they must submit accurate and truthful documentation to support their
   claims. Fraud exists when a claimant intentionally and materially misrepresents:
       2.54.1.1. The ownership, possession, value, condition, extent of damage, repair cost, purchase
       date, or replacement cost of claimed property.
       2.54.1.2. The cause of loss of or damage to the property.
       2.54.1.3. Other material facts necessary for the informed adjudication of the claim.
   2.54.2. Claims personnel assume claimants are honest. Therefore, in the absence of clear evidence to
   the contrary, discrepancies should be presumed to be a mistake, rather than an act of dishonesty.
   2.54.3. When settlement authorities determine that a claimant has committed fraud, they take action
   necessary and appropriate under the circumstances.
       2.54.3.1. A settlement authority may completely deny a claim that is substantially tainted by
       fraud. While the phrase "substantially tainted by fraud" is not easily defined, settlement authori-
       ties apply the term to each claim, based on common sense and all the circumstances of the claim.
       Claims substantially tainted by fraud include:
           2.54.3.1.1. Altered estimates that falsely represent a significant portion of the claim.
           2.54.3.1.2. Numerous missing items that the claimant never owned.
46                                                                          AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


            2.54.3.1.3. Intentional misrepresentation of the ages or the conditions of numerous claimed
            items.
            2.54.3.1.4. Enough examples of fraud to make it difficult, overly burdensome, or impossible
            for claims personnel to determine which items are legitimate.
        2.54.3.2. Settlement authorities do not deny a claim just because fraud exists, but consider the
        type and extent of the fraud in relation to the entire claim. Do not reject claims merely because
        claims personnel "feel" that "something is not right" about the claim, or because the claimant can-
        not produce evidence for claimed items. Document denials well to show the facts and rationale
        providing the basis for denial. The SJA must personally decide to deny an entire claim based on
        fraud. The SJA cannot delegate this authority.
        2.54.3.3. When settlement authorities find certain line items to be fraudulent or misrepresented,
        but the claim is not substantially tainted by fraud, they deny line items that are affected by the
        fraud or misrepresentation, even if some award on the affected line item is well-supported. Pay
        line items not tainted by the fraud or misrepresentation, if they are well-supported.
        2.54.3.4. Settlement authorities may deny or reduce the claim for fraud, even if the claimant
        alleges that another person, such as a spouse, completed the paperwork on the claimant's behalf.
     2.54.4. When settlement authorities detect fraud after making payment, they re-adjudicate the claim
     and request return of any overpayment. If the claimant declines to voluntarily repay the amount paid
     due to fraud, direct the appropriate accounting and finance authorities to withhold the money and
     credit it to claims funds, using DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization.
     2.54.5. Settlement authorities deny or reduce claims due to fraud, independent of any criminal action
     taken against the claimant and its result. When claims personnel reasonably suspect fraud, they
     immediately inform the SJA, who refers the matter to law enforcement authorities, if warranted.

Section 2I—Negligent or Wrongful Acts

2.55. Background. The Personnel Claims Act specifically provides that settlement authorities may pay
claims only if "no part of the loss or damage was caused by any negligent or wrongful act of the claimant
or an agent or employee of the claimant." (See 31 U.S.C. 3721f(1).)

2.56. Negligence. Negligence is a failure to exercise the degree of care expected under the circum-
stances, when that failure is a proximate cause of the claimed loss or damage.

2.57. Degree of Care. Settlement authorities assess whether a claimant used the same degree of care
that a reasonable person would have used under the same circumstances. Assessments will vary in accor-
dance with the circumstances, including the locale.

2.58. Contributory Negligence. The Personnel Claims Act applies contributory negligence standards.
In other words, if the claimant's negligence was a proximate cause of the loss or damage, settlement
authorities deny payment, even if other causes of the loss or damage exist. If the loss or damage would
have occurred whether or not the claimant committed the negligent act, do not deny payment for the loss
or damage based on claimant negligence.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                   47


2.59. Theft Cases. Negligence is often a crucial issue in theft cases. Settlement authorities consider
failure to use reasonable care to secure and protect property, especially small valuables, as negligence.
Because reasonable care in one part of the world may be a complete disregard for the security of the same
item somewhere else, settlement authorities must decide each claim on its own facts.

2.60. Wrongful Acts. If a claimant's criminal conduct was a proximate cause of the loss or damage, set-
tlement authorities deny payment. If a claimant's property suffers loss or damage while the claimant is in
violation of a nonpunitive regulation, consider the loss or damage to be incident to service, if the claim-
ant's conduct was not a proximate cause of the loss or damage.

2.61. Other Persons Whose Negligent or Wrongful Acts Prevent Payment:
   2.61.1. Settlement authorities do not pay for loss or damage resulting from the negligent or wrongful
   conduct of:
       2.61.1.1. Spouses.
       2.61.1.2. Children over the age of seven.
       2.61.1.3. Adult family members.
       2.61.1.4. House guests.
   2.61.2. The Air Force considers children under the age of seven to be incapable of negligence.
       2.61.2.1. Settlement authorities require a lesser degree of care from children between the ages of
       7 and 14 than from adults. Consider parents and persons to whom young children are entrusted as
       possibly negligent if they fail to supervise such children properly.
   2.61.3. Agents are persons that claimants select to carry out particular actions on their behalf. Settle-
   ment authorities do not pay claims resulting from an agent's negligent or wrongful conduct, if the con-
   duct occurs within the scope of the agency and reasonably relates to the tasks the agent was asked to
   perform.
   2.61.4. Employees are persons who work for the claimant, such as maids. Settlement authorities do
   not pay claims resulting from an employee's negligent or wrongful conduct, if the conduct occurs
   within the scope of employment and reasonably relates to the tasks the employee was hired to per-
   form.

Section 2J—Adjudication

2.62. Background. Adjudication of a claim consists of making the findings necessary to determine
whether the claim is payable and, if so, the appropriate amount. (See paragraph 2.10.) Claims personnel
adjudicate claims carefully to compensate claimants fairly. Use small claims procedures (see paragraph
2.86.) to the maximum extent permitted.

2.63. Payment Rules:
   2.63.1. Settlement authorities pay the claimant the fair market value of missing or destroyed property.
   (See paragraph 2.65.) In some cases, pay a fair and reasonable amount. (See paragraph 2.66.)
48                                                                            AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     2.63.2. Settlement authorities pay the claimant the actual, estimated, or agreed cost of repairs for
     damaged property up to the fair market value of the property. In some cases, pay a reasonable sum
     instead of repair costs. (See paragraph 2.67.3.) In other cases, paying for a loss of value may be
     appropriate. (See paragraph 2.67.4.)
     2.63.3. Claims personnel consider damaged property to be destroyed, if the cost of repairing it
     exceeds its fair market value. In such cases, limit payment to the fair market value, less the salvage
     value, if applicable. (See paragraph 2.72.)

2.64. Time and Place of Loss or Damage. Claims personnel record property loss or damage accord-
ing to the time and place at which the loss or damage occurs. For administrative convenience, claims per-
sonnel may use the time the claim was filed and the local area as the time and place of the loss or damage.
EXCEPTION: Do not use the time the claim was filed, if the result of the claim would be markedly dif-
ferent.

2.65. Fair Market Value.
     2.65.1. Claims personnel measure fair market value for missing, destroyed, and economically irrepa-
     rable property according to:
        2.65.1.1. Depreciated current replacement cost.
        2.65.1.2. Established fair market value.
     2.65.2. If a regular market exists for used items of the particular type, claims personnel measure the
     loss or damage by the cost of a similar item of similar age. Get prices from industry guides, estimates,
     or appraisals from dealers to determine value. When an established fair market value exists, do not
     deduct depreciation.
     2.65.3. When an item does not depreciate, claims personnel set its fair market value as equal to its
     current replacement cost.
     2.65.4. When an item does depreciate, claims personnel set its fair market value as equal to the cur-
     rent replacement cost, minus any depreciation. Base depreciation on the age, usage, or condition of
     the property before it was damaged. Use depreciated replacement cost as the typical measure of fair
     market value for most missing, destroyed, or economically irreparable items.
     2.65.5. Current replacement cost is the cost of a new item of the same type or, if the identical item is
     not available, the cost of a new item as similar in quality, description, and function as possible.
     2.65.6. In setting replacement cost prices, claims personnel consider:
        2.65.6.1. Replacement cost quotations the claimant submits.
        2.65.6.2. Catalog prices.
        2.65.6.3. Prices for similar items from local merchants.
        When a claimant can purchase the identical item or a comparable item at the base exchange or
        through the exchange mail order catalog at a lower cost, use the exchange replacement cost.

2.66. "Fair and Reasonable" (F&R) Payments. Claims personnel may set a "fair and reasonable"
(F&R) payment for missing or destroyed property if they decide that other measures in paragraph 2.65.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                  49


would undercompensate or overcompensate the claimant. Because F&R payments may prevent carrier
recovery, do not use them when a more appropriate measure is available. An F&R payment for a missing
or destroyed item should reflect the value of an item similar in quality, description, age, condition, and
function to the greatest extent possible. When making such payments, explain the basis for the award to
the claimant. Consider an F&R payment when:
   2.66.1. The item is obsolete.
   2.66.2. The claimant cannot replace the item in the local area.
   2.66.3. The claimant cannot replace the item at any cost.
   2.66.4. The claimant asks for a replacement price considerably higher than what is reasonable for the
   item described.

2.67. Cost of Repairs and Alternative Measures for Damaged Property:
   2.67.1. The cost of repair may be:
       2.67.1.1. The actual cost, as demonstrated by a paid bill.
       2.67.1.2. A reasonable estimated cost, as demonstrated by a repair estimate.
       2.67.1.3. An agreed cost of repair.
NOTE: Claims personnel may require a claimant to obtain a second estimate, if the first appears unrea-
sonably high.
   2.67.2. Claims personnel agree with the claimant on repair costs ("agreed cost of repair" or AGC) up
   to $500 per claim, instead of requiring estimates or conducting an inspection, if damage is minor and
   an estimate would be expensive or difficult to obtain. Use this method, especially when processing
   small claims. Claims personnel must inspect the item, if the agreed repair cost is more than $100 per
   item. When conducting an inspection, do not set agreed repair costs of more than $250 per item.
   2.67.3. If the shipment damage to an item is so minor that it does not significantly detract from the
   item's appearance or affect its intended usage, or it does not warrant repairs as extensive as the esti-
   mate calls for, settlement authorities pay a reasonable amount to compensate for the damage, instead
   of paying for a repair.
       2.67.3.1. Claims personnel may need to inspect the damage to make this decision.
   2.67.4. Settlement authorities pay for loss of value (LOV), in addition to the cost of repairs when the
   repairs reduce the fair market value of an item. Do not pay for LOV, instead of repair costs.
       2.67.4.1. Claims personnel require the claimant to have the item repaired first and then determine
       whether there is an LOV. LOV may be appropriate for antiques, paintings, art objects, upholstered
       furniture, and other items, if repairs cannot restore them to their former value. Special rules for
       LOV apply to sets of furniture. (See paragraph 2.70.)

2.68. Preexisting Damage (PED). Preexisting Damage (PED) is damage to a repairable item that pre-
dates the incident giving rise to a claim. PED is most commonly identified by the use of symbols on
household goods shipment inventories.
   2.68.1. When PED appears on an inventory, claims personnel must determine whether:
50                                                                          AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


         2.68.1.1. The PED did, in fact, exist.
         2.68.1.2. The cost of repairing the item includes repairing the PED.
         Claims personnel must make these findings to aid in carrier recovery.
     2.68.2. Claims personnel do not deduct for PED without an actual inspection by a Government repre-
     sentative.
     EXCEPTION: Settlement authorities may waive the inspection, if they personally decide the dis-
     tance to the place of the inspection or other factors makes an inspection economically impractical.
     Settlement authorities may not delegate this decision. Document this decision in the file.
     2.68.3. If an estimate does not include repair of the PED (even if the PED appears on the inventory),
     claims personnel do not deduct for PED.
     2.68.4. If the estimate includes repair of PED, claims personnel deduct the percentage attributable to
     repair of PED.
     EXCEPTION: When new damage to an item necessitates repairing the PED, claims personnel allow
     the full cost of repairs.
     2.68.5. If the PED that must be repaired is roughly equal to or greater than the new damage, so that
     the claimant's property will be enhanced, claims personnel deduct for the amount of PED being
     repaired.

2.69. Normal Maintenance. Settlement authorities do not pay for normal maintenance expenses,
including charges for cleaning, servicing, aligning, or tuning.
EXCEPTION: Settlement authorities do pay such expenses when they are required to repair actual dam-
ages.

2.70. Sets. Normally, when component parts of a set are missing or destroyed, settlement authorities
only pay the claimant for the replacement of the missing or destroyed components.
EXCEPTION: When a set is no longer useful for its intended purpose because component parts are
missing or destroyed, pay for the replacement of the entire set.

2.71. Depreciation. The Personnel Claims Act is only intended to compensate claimants for the fair
market value of their loss. In assessing claims, claims personnel keep in mind that most used items that
have been lost or destroyed are worth less than new items of the same type. Depreciate the price of new
replacement items to equal the actual fair market value of the lost or destroyed item. Use the average
yearly and flat rates of depreciation in the Allowance List
     •   Depreciation Guide (ALDG) for determining fair market value of used property in various catego-
         ries.
EXCEPTION: If a more appropriate measure of fair market value is available, use it instead.
The General Claims Division distributes the ALDG to claims offices separately.
     2.71.1. Claims personnel may decrease or increase the listed ALDG depreciation rate, if personal
     inspection of damaged property, or other evidence, such as photos, indicates that the property was in
     better than average condition or worse than average condition before the damage. Make decisions to
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                    51


   increase the rate of depreciation cautiously. Do not depreciate an item that the claimant had used for
   less than six months when the loss or damage occurred.
   2.71.2. Do not depreciate goods during periods of long-term storage paid for by the Government.
   2.71.3. Normally, do not depreciate repair costs. When repairs involve replacing parts, do not depre-
   ciate the replacement parts.
   EXCEPTION: Depreciate parts that claimants would separately purchase or replace during the useful
   life of the item.
       2.71.3.1. On complete paint jobs for vehicles, depreciate both labor and material at
       10 percent per year. Do not depreciate minor paint jobs.
       2.71.3.2. When furniture is reupholstered, depreciate the cost of new fabric at five percent per
       year and allow labor costs as claimed.
   2.71.4. If an item was repaired to an almost new condition after the claimant acquires it, measure the
   age of the item for depreciation purposes from the date of the repair, rather than the original purchase
   date.
   2.71.5. Depreciate no item by more than 75 percent.

2.72. Salvage. Settlement authorities pay the fair market value for an item damaged beyond economi-
cally practical repair. If the claimant keeps the item, pay the fair market value at the time of destruction,
less the salvage value.
   2.72.1. Claims personnel advise claimants not to dispose of damaged items until authorities settle the
   claim to allow both the Air Force and, in shipment cases, the carrier to inspect and salvage any items
   for which the claimant is paid full value.
   EXCEPTION: Claims offices may authorize claimants to dispose of any property that poses a safety
   or health hazard. Document in the file permission given to the claimant to dispose of an item. Note:
   For increased release valuation shipment cases, see the Joint Military-Industry Memorandum of
   Understanding on Salvage.
   2.72.2. If a claimant wishes to keep an item, deduct the appropriate salvage value at the time of settle-
   ment. While no set salvage value exists on items, avoid using unrealistically high salvage values.
   2.72.3. When the claimant does not want to keep an item or the claimant's wishes are unknown and
   settlement authorities have paid fair market value for the damaged personal property, claims personnel
   turn it in to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO).
   EXCEPTION: Do not follow this procedure for increased release valuation shipment claims.
   Instead, follow the procedures in paragraph 2.72.3.5.
   EXCEPTION: If the property's value is not great enough to justify the cost of turning it into salvage,
   advise the claimant that he or she may keep or otherwise dispose of the item.
       2.72.3.1. For items with salvage value, claims personnel advise claimants in the settlement letter
       that by receiving payment of the fair market value, they must now turn the items in to the Govern-
       ment.
52                                                                            AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


        2.72.3.2. Because the property belongs to the Government, the Government picks up and moves
        the property for disposition.
        EXCEPTION: The claimant agrees to move it.
        2.72.3.3. If the base does not have the capability to routinely pick up salvageable items, settle-
        ment authorities consider whether the item has salvage value beyond the cost of transportation.
        2.72.3.4. Complete DD Form 1348-1, DoD Single-Line Item Release/Receipt Document, for
        items turned in to DRMO. Include a copy of the form in the claim file.
        2.72.3.5. For increased released valuation shipment claims, when the Air Force pays the fair mar-
        ket value for damaged property and asserts a carrier recovery claim, the carrier, upon paying the
        Air Force claim, may salvage the property. Note: See the applicable rules in the Joint Mili-
        tary-Industry Memorandum of Understanding on Salvage.
        EXCEPTION: If claims personnel have deducted the salvage value, the carrier has no right to the
        property.
        2.72.3.6. When the carrier is entitled to the property under the Joint Military-Industry Memoran-
        dum of Understanding on Salvage, claims personnel provide a notice to the claimant to ensure that
        the claimant holds on to the property until after the carrier's entitlement period ends.
            2.72.3.6.1. For claims that claimants have presented and received payment for within 120
            days after delivery of a shipment, the claimant's settlement letter reads: "You were awarded the
            full or depreciated value of some of your property. As the result of a memorandum of under-
            standing between the carrier industry and the military services, this property now belongs to
            the carrier. The carrier has until (enter the exact date, calculated by adding 35 days to the later
            of: (a) the date of the settlement letter, (b) 75 days added to the date of delivery of the ship-
            ment, or (c) 45 days added to the date the DD Form 1840R was sent to the carrier) to make
            arrangements for the pickup of this property. If a carrier representative fails to contact you
            concerning pickup of the property by (again, list the date), you may dispose of the items as you
            choose."
            2.72.3.6.2. For claims that settlement authorities have approved for payment more than 120
            days after delivery, the claimant's settlement letter reads: "You were awarded the full or depre-
            ciated value of some of your property. As the result of a memorandum of understanding
            between the carrier industry and the military services, this property now belongs to the carrier.
            The carrier has until (enter the exact date, calculated by adding 35 days from the date of the
            settlement letter) to make arrangements for the pickup of this property. If a carrier representa-
            tive fails to contact you concerning pickup of the property by (again, list the date), you may
            dispose of the items as you choose."
        2.72.3.7. If the claimant has disposed of the property during the time period that the carrier was
        entitled to salvage, give the carrier a credit according to the Joint Military-Industry Memorandum
        of Understanding on Salvage. The settlement authority may get from the claimant an amount
        equal to the credit.
     2.72.4. If the claimant does not receive full compensation for an item because a maximum allowance
     applies, claims personnel do not deduct salvage or require the claimant to turn in the item.

2.73. Recovered Property:
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                        53


   2.73.1. If claimants locate lost property before settlement authorities approve the claim for payment,
   settlement authorities do not pay for such property.
   EXCEPTION: Settlement authorities pay for:
       2.73.1.1. Items that have been damaged in shipment.
       2.73.1.2. Necessary items that were missing for an unreasonable time after the expected arrival
       date and that the claimant replaced before recovery. Note: Necessary items are those that are
       basic to the operation of a household.
           2.73.1.2.1. Claimants who receive payment in accordance with the exception to paragraph
           2.73.1. disclaim in writing further interest and ownership in such items.
   2.73.2. If lost property is located after a settlement authority has approved the claim for payment,
   claims personnel advise the claimant of two options:
       2.73.2.1. To accept any or all of the items located and repay the amount already allowed for such
       items.
       2.73.2.2. Disclaim in writing further interest and ownership in the property and keep the amount
       that the settlement authority has approved for payment.
           2.73.2.2.1. If the settlement authority determines that the recovered property is substantially
           different in quality, price, or value from the property claimed, the settlement authority may
           require the claimant to return the amount allowed for such property and accept the property.

Section 2K—Insurance

2.74. Private Insurance. Because the Personnel Claims Act is not intended to be a substitute for private
insurance or to benefit private insurers, claimants must provide copies of policies. Claimants with insur-
ance coverage for all or part of the loss or damage must file claims with their insurers before claims per-
sonnel process their claims against the Air Force.

2.75. Claimant's Refusal. If claimants refuse to provide a copy of their insurance policy, claims per-
sonnel submit a demand on the insurer (or take other action necessary to present a demand on the insurer),
and deduct the amount of insurance recovery lost. In the absence of clear evidence to the contrary,
assume that the claimant's insurer would have fully compensated the claimant and deny the claim on this
basis.

2.76. Claimant's Failure to Notify. If the claimant negligently or intentionally, and without good
cause, fails to provide the insurer with timely notice and, thus, allows the insurer a basis to deny the insur-
ance demand, claims personnel deduct the amount of insurance recovery lost.
   2.76.1. "Good cause" includes:
       2.76.1.1. Officially recognized absence (TDY).
       2.76.1.2. Hospitalization that directly contributes to the claimant's failure to notify the insurer.
       2.76.1.3. Proven misinformation by Government personnel.
54                                                                           AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     2.76.2. Claimants must be aware of the provisions of their insurance policies. Settlement authorities
     do not consider a claimant's lack of familiarity with insurance policy notice requirements to be good
     cause.

2.77. Suspending Adjudication Awaiting Insurance Settlement. Claims personnel suspend adjudi-
cating insured items until the insurer settles the claim.
EXCEPTION: Claims personnel do not suspend their adjudication or processing, if the insurer denies
the claim or the delay causes a hardship on the claimant. If delay causes a hardship, pay the claim and file
a subrogation claim against the insurer.
     2.77.1. Do not suspend adjudicating items that insurance clearly does not cover.

2.78. Payment Allowed When Claimant Has Insurance. Claims personnel deduct the amount a
claimant recovers from insurance from the amount payable by the Air Force. When possible, do this on
an item-by-item basis. Do not make any deduction for those items that the claimant claims against the Air
Force but that insurance does not cover.

Section 2L—DD Form 1840/1840R and Lost Potential Carrier Recovery

2.79. DD Form 1840/1840R.
     2.79.1. Claims personnel use two pink forms to notify carriers of transportation or storage loss or
     damage:
        2.79.1.1. DD Form 1840, Joint Statement of Loss or Damage at Delivery.
        2.79.1.2. DD Form 1840R, Notice of Loss or Damage.
NOTE: DD Form 1840R is the reverse side of DD Form 1840.
     2.79.2. Claims personnel consult the Military-Industry Agreement on Loss and Damage Rules for
     procedures on using DD Forms 1840 and 1840R. If the carrier provides the claimant with DD Forms
     1840 and 1840R at delivery, the carrier is entitled to timely notice of all loss or damage during ship-
     ment. Claimants must list specific loss or damage (with inventory numbers) on DD Form 1840 at
     delivery, or on DD Form 1840R later. When additional loss or damage is listed on DD Form 1840R,
     the claimant submits DD Form 1840R to the claims office within 70 days of delivery. The claims
     office reviews the form and sends it to the carrier within 75 days of delivery. Settlement authorities
     may extend this 75-day period, if the claimant is hospitalized or on TDY.
     2.79.3. Although a claimant should submit DD Form 1840R to the claims office within 70 days,
     claims personnel must accept the form on or before the 75th day after delivery, and send it to the car-
     rier in time. If DD Form 1840R arrives on the 75th day after delivery, send it on the same day.
     2.79.4. Lost potential carrier recovery (PCR) is money that the Government cannot collect from a car-
     rier or warehouse firm because the claimant failed to provide proper or timely notice of loss or dam-
     age. Claims personnel deduct the entire amount of lost PCR on an item-by-item basis from the
     amount they would otherwise have awarded to the claimant.
     EXCEPTION: Claims personnel do not deduct from the claimant if the claimant has good cause.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                  55


   2.79.5. In many cases, lost PCR results in 100 percent deductions on affected items because claims
   personnel could otherwise have collected the entire amount of the loss or damage. When 100 percent
   deductions are necessary on all items claimed, the result is denial of the entire claim. When the car-
   rier's depreciated value of an item is less than the Air Force's depreciated value, pay the claimant the
   difference between the two depreciated values.
   2.79.6. Because a claimant's failure to provide proper and timely notice on DD Forms 1840 and
   1840R may be cause to presume that the loss or damage was not shipment-related, settlement author-
   ities may use this failure to deny payment on one or more items, apart from the issue of lost PCR. The
   longer the time period between delivery and the filing of a claim without proper or timely notice on
   DD Form 1840 or 1840R, the stronger the presumption.
   2.79.7. When claimants show good cause for not submitting DD Form 1840R within
   75 days, claims personnel make no deduction for lost PCR and no presumption about shipment loss or
   damage.
      2.79.7.1. A settlement authority may find good cause when the claimant:
          2.79.7.1.1. Was on TDY or undergoing hospitalization. Note: When a TDY or hospitaliza-
          tion constitutes good cause, settlement authorities add the length of the absence to the 75 days,
          and the claimant must then submit DD Form 1840R within the newly-established time period.
          2.79.7.1.2. Receives misinformation or improper counseling from Government personnel
          concerning DD Forms 1840 and 1840R.
          2.79.7.1.3. Was moved for the first time.
          2.79.7.1.4. Had other appropriate reasons.

Section 2M—Increased Protection Shipments

2.80. General Information.
   2.80.1. Claimants may purchase two types of additional protection on Government-sponsored house-
   hold goods shipments:
      2.80.1.1. An increase in the basic valuation.
      2.80.1.2. Full replacement protection.
      The transportation office arranges this added protection with the carrier. Claimants may purchase
      the two types of added protection only on household goods shipments that begin and end in the
      United States.
      EXCEPTION: Claimants may not purchase added protection for shipments to or from Hawaii.
      EXCEPTION: Added protection options do not apply during periods of nontemporary storage.
   2.80.2. Increasing the Basic Valuation (Option 1). Option 1 is depreciated value coverage, which
   the Air Force provides either as a valuation in excess of $1.25 per pound times the weight of the ship-
   ment, or as a lump sum declaration. Transportation personnel must reflect option 1 in the remarks sec-
   tion of the GBL.
56                                                                           AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     2.80.3. Full Replacement Protection (Option 2). Option 2 is nondepreciated full replacement
     value coverage and is more expensive than option 1. Transportation personnel must reflect option 2
     in the remarks section of the GBL. Under option 2, the carrier can choose to repair or replace items,
     rather than pay full replacement value to the claimant.

2.81. Procedures for Option 1 and 2 Shipments:
     2.81.1. Claimants who purchase option 1 or 2 must first submit a claim for loss or damage to the car-
     rier. Claims offices help the claimant file against the carrier and may compute the carrier's liability.
     Claims offices must advise claimants not to accept a settlement offer or check from the carrier unless
     the claimant is totally satisfied with the settlement and does not intend to pursue a claim against the
     Air Force for any portion of the claim.
     2.81.2. If the carrier denies the claim, makes an inadequate settlement offer, or causes hardship to the
     claimant by delaying settlement for more than 60 days after submission of the claim to the carrier, the
     claimant may submit the claim to the Air Force.
        2.81.2.1. Claims personnel process option 1 claims in accordance with this chapter. Assert a sub-
        rogation claim against the carrier for the full adjudicated value of the loss or damage without
        regard to maximum allowable payments. Set off the carrier, if necessary. If the carrier pays more
        than the Air Force did on any item, pay the claimant the additional amount.
        2.81.2.2. Claims personnel process option 2 claims in accordance with this chapter.
        EXCEPTION: In complying with this chapter, claims personnel do not take depreciation and do
        not apply maximum allowable payments. In other words, the Air Force pays the claimant full
        replacement value.
        Assert a subrogation claim against the carrier for the full adjudicated, nondepreciated value of the
        loss or damage without regard to maximum allowable payments. Set off the carrier, if necessary.

Section 2N—Claims Office Administration

2.82. Basic Policy. The claims process is not an adversarial one. The policy underlying passage of the
Personnel Claims Act is to pay meritorious personnel claims fairly and promptly to maintain claimants'
morale and avoid their financial hardship. Claimants who have suffered loss or damage are entitled to
helpful, friendly, and courteous service.

2.83. Settlement Letters. When settlement authorities deny a claim or approve it in an amount less than
that claimed, they must give the claimant a detailed, clear, and understandable explanation of the reasons.
Claims personnel aim to make less than satisfied claimants aware of the basis for the action taken, both to
give them a meaningful opportunity to ask for reconsideration and to assure them that they receive fair
and impartial treatment. Give claimants a copy of the adjudication of their claim as an attachment to the
settlement letter.

2.84. Publicity. The personnel claims program exists not only to pay meritorious claims, but also to
encourage potential claimants to adopt measures that reduce the risk of loss or damage and to assist them
in providing evidence of loss or damage that occurs. Use daily bulletins and other base publications to
publicize matters, such as:
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                 57


   2.84.1. The availability of full replacement coverage through the transportation office.
   2.84.2. Completing household goods inventories.
   2.84.3. Using DD Forms 1840 and 1840R.
   2.84.4. The maximum allowances for various types of property.
   2.84.5. Problems associated with DITY moves and mobile home shipments.
   2.84.6. Problems associated with the shipment of expensive items, such as jewelry.
   2.84.7. Rules about securing bicycles and storing property in vehicles.
   2.84.8. Insurance requirements.

2.85. Risk Management. Risk management is an important part of a base personnel claims program.
Claims personnel must assess how base and unit policies affect claims. Prompt payment of claims is not
a substitute for policies that minimize the occurrence of preventable loss or damage. An effective claims
prevention program can affect both the flow of claims funds in an era of tight fiscal constraints and the
overall quality of life on an installation.

2.86. Small Claims Procedures. Small claims are those for $1,000 or less that do not require extensive
investigation. Claims personnel use small claims procedures whenever possible.
   2.86.1. Relax the requirement for evidence under the small claims procedures. Obtain evidence to
   support the claim by telephone, from incident reports, and other easily available sources.
   2.86.2. Use agreed cost of repair whenever possible. (See paragraph 2.67.2.)
   2.86.3. Claims personnel may waive the requirement for any documents.

2.87. Claims Office Procedures:
   2.87.1. Claims personnel maintain a sign-in log for all customers visiting the office. Note: Such logs
   are frequently invaluable in showing when a claimant visited the claims office, if a dispute arises
   over when the claimant presented a claim or DD Form 1840R.
   2.87.2. Claims personnel note the actual date received on all documents mailed to the office.
   2.87.3. Because claimants' perception of the quality and fairness of the claims process largely
   depends on the adequacy of the initial briefing or counseling they receive, claims personnel must treat
   every briefing or counseling as important.
   2.87.4. Claims personnel inform claimants of the two-year time limitation for presenting a claim.
   Inform claimants of the requirements to notify a carrier or insurer and the consequences of not doing
   so. Provide this information via newcomer briefings, newspaper articles, and so on. Similarly coun-
   sel claimants calling or writing the claims office for advice.
   2.87.5. Claims personnel explain the claim forms and help claimants complete them correctly. Help
   claimants accurately describe the facts and circumstances giving rise to the claim and accurately list
   items and damage. Copy and return original documents that they receive from the claimant.
   EXCEPTION: Claims personnel keep the original carrier and warehouse inventories and give the
   claimant copies.
58                                                                             AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     2.87.6. Claims personnel make available the standardized claims handouts that the General Claims
     Division distributes, as well as any necessary local supplemental information. Prepare for prospective
     claimants a small instruction packet with the claim forms and guidance for filling them out. Where
     resources permit, individually assist claimants who come into the office.
     2.87.7. Claims personnel maintain a current list of local firms that can repair various types of property
     at a reasonable cost. Provide lists for both vehicle and furniture repairs, preferably with at least three
     names each. Advise claimants that the listing of a firm is not an endorsement. Advise claimants to
     consult the claims office before getting an estimate from an unlisted firm. If a firm cannot repair the
     property in question or is known for substandard work or unusually high estimate fees or repair
     charges, advise the claimant to find another firm.
     2.87.8. Claims personnel maintain current exchange and retail catalogs for claimant's use.
     2.87.9. Claims personnel advise claimants that the carrier has the right to inspect damaged items.
     Consult the Military-Industry Memorandum of Understanding on Loss and Damage Rules. Do not
     delay settlement of claims merely because the carrier inspection period has not run out. If the claims
     office learns that a claimant has refused the carrier the right to inspect, the claims office ensures that
     the inspection takes place. If necessary, deduct lost PCR on all damaged items the carrier was not
     allowed to inspect.
     2.87.10. A claimant may settle a claim directly with the carrier. However, if a claimant does so, they
     may not seek additional payment from the Air Force, because the claimant will have eliminated the
     Air Force's subrogation right.
     EXCEPTION: The claimant may seek additional payment from the Air Force, if Air Force liability
     is greater than the maximum carrier liability.
     Claims personnel caution claimants not to accept settlement offers or checks from carriers unless they
     are totally satisfied with the settlement and do not intend to pursue a claim against the Air Force.
     2.87.11. Claims personnel advise claimants not to throw items away before settling the claim and
     before the carrier's inspection period or salvage period ends.
     EXCEPTION: Claims personnel may encourage disposal of hazardous or unsafe items.
     2.87.12. Claims personnel review claim forms to ensure completeness. Do not refuse to accept a
     claim or return a claim because it lacks documents or does not arrive on a certain form. Instead,
     advise claimants that such deficiencies may delay processing. When handling initial claims and
     reconsideration requests:
        2.87.12.1. Ensure that the claimant or agent has signed the claim form and stated a sum certain (in
        the "amount claimed" block).
        2.87.12.2. Mark or stamp the claim form with the actual date and time received.
        2.87.12.3. Sign or initial the form.
     2.87.13. The claimant must complete enough information on the claim form to verify the cost, age,
     and inventory number of each item claimed. The claimant must list the current replacement cost and
     the original purchase price and fully describe the item, including the brand and model. If an item was
     a gift, the claimant states this fact and lists the gift's value when first received. If the item was used,
     the claimant should state this and list the item's age when first received, if known.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                 59


  2.87.14. If the claimant has not provided required information on the claim form or evidence, such as
  repair estimates or replacement cost quotations, claims personnel may suspend adjudication of the
  claim. Settle any items that can be settled and advise the claimant in the settlement letter of the need
  for additional information. Give the claimant a specified amount of time to submit the additional
  information, such as 30 days, and advise the claimant that if the information is not provided, the Air
  Force may deny payment for the affected items.
  2.87.15. Settlement authorities may make an emergency partial payment in advance of a final settle-
  ment upon the request of a claimant when a hardship situation exists. Do not make emergency partial
  payments beyond $2,000.
     2.87.15.1. In order to receive a partial payment, the claimant must file a claim for at least the
     amount of the partial payment. List enough lost or damaged items to support and justify the full
     partial payment. Claims personnel may suggest that the claimant list a few high-value items to
     cover the partial payment, rather than providing a lengthy list of small items. The claimant may
     later amend the claim for the full extent of the loss or damage. If the claims office determines a
     hardship exists and that, based on the claim form, any supporting documentation, and any inspec-
     tion, the claim is clearly payable in an amount equal to or exceeding the proposed emergency par-
     tial payment, claims personnel prepare an acceptance agreement, have the claimant sign it, and
     arrange for the claimant to receive an immediate cash payment.
     2.87.15.2. Claims offices may issue more than one partial payment to a claimant, if individual cir-
     cumstances warrant.
  2.87.16. When accepting a claim, claims personnel convert repair or replacement costs stated in for-
  eign currency to US dollars. Claims personnel may use the military exchange rate or a commercial
  exchange rate that they obtain from a newspaper listing or commercial bank. For items that have been
  replaced or repaired using foreign currency, use the exchange rate in effect at the time the item was
  repaired or replaced. For items that have not been repaired or replaced, use the exchange rate in effect
  on the day the claim is received.
     2.87.16.1. Claimants enter purchase prices in a foreign currency or the US dollar equivalent, as
     the claims office requests.
     2.87.16.2. Claims personnel adjust the amount allowed up or down for items that claimants will
     later repair or replace using a foreign currency, if a significant change in the exchange rate occurs
     between the time the claimant files the claim and the time claims personnel adjudicate the claim.
     2.87.16.3. Claims personnel may deviate from this general rule, if it appears that the claimant
     would receive a windfall as a result. Claimants may not receive reconsideration and further pay-
     ment because a change in the exchange rate occurs after settlement authorities settle a claim.
  2.87.17. Claims offices translate documents written in a foreign language before sending the claim to
  the General Claims Division for reconsideration or carrier recovery purposes. Provide translations
  with carrier recovery claims sent to US carriers and warehouse firms. Translate brief estimates of
  repair, receipts, and similar items necessary for payment verbatim. Claims offices may summarize
  long estimates, foreign police reports, and similar documents.
  2.87.18. When authorities settle the claim, claims personnel record the appropriate action in the
  appropriate block on the claim form. The signature of the settlement authority verifies that the claim
  meets all requirements for payment in the amount specified or that the claim warrants denial.
60                                                                          AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     2.87.19. Claims personnel prepare SF 1034 in the number of copies the local AFO requires and send
     the voucher with the original and a copy of the approval page of the claim form, or other approval doc-
     ument, to the finance office for payment. If the local AFO does not require SF 1034, claims personnel
     may submit the approval page of the claim form or other approval document with the appropriate fund
     citation noted on it. Do not substitute another form for SF 1034. Note: The AFCIMS-prepared SF
     1034 may be the simplest submission, even if the local AFO does not require it.
     2.87.20. Claims personnel draft a memorandum of opinion for every claim denied or submitted for
     reconsideration. Use supporting memoranda for approvals and partial approvals as well. Provide
     enough detail in the memorandum so that the basis for the action recommended is clear. Include the
     following information:
        2.87.20.1. The claimant's name, address, rank or pay grade, and status (NAFI employee, Red
        Cross employee, Army retiree, ROTC cadet, Reservist on active duty for training, foreign national
        employee, and so on). State whether the claimant is a proper claimant.
        2.87.20.2. The date and place of the incident giving rise to the claim. Where relevant, state
        whether the incident occurred on or off base and whether it occurred at quarters, an authorized
        place, and so on.
        2.87.20.3. The amount of claim, date of filing, and the date the claimant requested reconsidera-
        tion. Explain any excessive delays in settling the claim or taking action on the request for recon-
        sideration.
        2.87.20.4. Provide a description of the incident with the relevant facts.
        2.87.20.5. Summarize the issues that the claimant raises on reconsideration and provide a listing
        of the items that authorities have not settled.
        2.87.20.6. Provide the factual and legal bases supporting the recommended action. When recom-
        mending denial based on the claimant's negligence, explain what conduct was expected of the
        claimant under the circumstances.
        2.87.20.7. Specify the action recommended.
     2.87.21. An erroneous payment is:
        2.87.21.1. A payment that settlement authorities make based on facts from the claimant that the
        authorities later determine to be incorrect or untrue.
        2.87.21.2. A payment that settlement authorities later determine they have made improperly or
        without legal authority.
        Settlement authorities must get erroneous payments back from the claimant. If the claimant
        refuses to repay voluntarily or fails to meet an arranged payment schedule, the claims office pre-
        pares DD Form 139 for the servicing AFO, or takes other appropriate action to establish and col-
        lect the debt. Claims offices ensure that they have first met procedural requirements, such as
        notifying the claimant. By signing the claim form, the claimant agrees to return payments, or con-
        sents to collection from other monies due because of incorrect or untrue information.
     2.87.22. Claims offices must personally contact local transportation, contracting, and AFOs regularly
     to ensure that:
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                     61


       2.87.22.1. Personnel moving to another base receive adequate counseling and standard claims
       handouts.
       2.87.22.2. Transportation authorities provide inspections when claims personnel request them.
       2.87.22.3. Contracting personnel handle DPM setoffs quickly.
       2.87.22.4. AFO personnel make emergency and small claims payments promptly.

Section 2O—Reconsideration

2.88. General Policy. A claimant may request reconsideration of a partial approval or a denial of a
claim. Claims personnel must be sensitive to claimants' assertions of unfair treatment and must fully
explore and correct an error upon any indication that a claimant's grievance is well-founded.
   2.88.1. Proper claimants and their agents may request reconsideration. Claims personnel treat a com-
   plaint made through a Congressional representative that a settlement was inadequate or inappropriate
   as a request for reconsideration.
   2.88.2. The settlement authority must reconsider a claim upon timely written request.
       2.88.2.1. Claims personnel make every effort to investigate the claimant's version of the facts.
       2.88.2.2. Original settlement authorities established by this instruction must act on reconsidera-
       tion requests personally. They may not delegate this authority.
       2.88.2.3. Settlement authorities modify the initial settlement, if they determine that the initial set-
       tlement for any item is incorrect. Clearly state the basis for any change in the file. Review the
       request for reconsideration item by item.
       2.88.2.4. Upon reconsideration, the settlement authority makes payment for any item:
          2.88.2.4.1. That merits payment in full.
          2.88.2.4.2. That merits payment in full, less the standard depreciation.
          2.88.2.4.3. For which the claimant agrees to accept a lesser amount from the settlement
          authority.
       2.88.2.5. If the settlement authority does not grant all the relief requested, other than reductions
       for standard depreciation and agreed amounts, claims personnel send the claim to the General
       Claims Division, with recommendations and supporting rationale on the items that the settlement
       authority did not pay. Claims personnel advise the claimant by letter that the claim was sent to the
       General Claims Division.
       2.88.2.6. The General Claims Division decides all requests for reconsideration. The General
       Claims Division may reverse previous decisions on reconsideration, to include denying the claim
       in full, where appropriate. The decision of the General Claims Division is final and conclusive,
       and claimants may not appeal the decision to any other Air Force authority, agency, or court.
   2.88.3. Claimants submit requests for reconsideration within 60 days of the claim settlement date.
   Settlement authorities may waive the 60-day period for good cause.
   2.88.4. A settlement authority may always reconsider the initial settlement of a claim without a writ-
   ten request, if the original action was in error or new facts reveal it to be incorrect.
62                                                                           AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


Section 2P—Mobile Homes

2.89. Background Information. Mobile homes present special problems. Because mobile home ship-
ments can result in enormous, uncompensated loss or damage for members and present unusual difficul-
ties for claims adjudicators, claims offices must coordinate with their servicing transportation offices to
ensure that members shipping mobile homes understand the risks and their responsibilities and that the
transportation office does not authorize shipment of a mobile home unfit for shipment.

2.90. Latent Defects. Many carriers attempt to escape liability by attributing all damage to latent man-
ufacturing defects. Settlement authorities do not consider loss or damage due to such a defect (as with any
other mechanical defect) to be shipment-related.
EXCEPTION: If the carrier knew or should have known of the defect, and the claimant could not reason-
ably have been expected to know of it, consider the loss or damage due to the defect to be ship-
ment-related.

2.91. When an engineer's report or other evidence shows that a defect, rather than the carrier's failure to
take the necessary care, caused the damage, three rules apply:
     2.91.1. If both the carrier and the claimant knew or should have known of the defect, and if the claim-
     ant took no corrective action and had the mobile home shipped anyway, do not pay the claim.
     2.91.2. If the carrier knew or should have known of the defect, and the claimant could not reasonably
     have been expected to know of it, settlement authorities pay the claim and take action against the car-
     rier.
     2.91.3. If neither the claimant nor the carrier could reasonably be expected to know of the defect, do
     not pay the claim.

2.92. Supporting a Claim.
     2.92.1. Before adjudicating such claims, claims personnel inspect the mobile home and get the fol-
     lowing evidence, if possible:
        2.92.1.1. DD Form 1800.
        2.92.1.2. DD Form 1863.
        2.92.1.3. DD Forms 1840 and 1840R.
        2.92.1.4. DD Form 1412.
        2.92.1.5. DD Form 1841.
        2.92.1.6. Driver's statement.
        2.92.1.7. Owner's statement.
        2.92.1.8. Repair estimates.
        2.92.1.9. Engineer's statement.
     2.92.2. DD Form 1800, Mobile Home Shipment Inspection Record, shows a mobile home's condi-
     tion before and after shipment. The carrier completes this document and both the carrier and the
     member sign it. Sections of the form are reserved for the origin and destination transportation office
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                    63


  when a Government inspector performs a visual inspection of the mobile home at origin or destina-
  tion. Because this form is vital to the claim process, settlement authorities do not pay a claim without
  it. Claimants may also list damages on DD Form 1840.
  2.92.3. For shipments after 1 November 1987, DD Form 1863, Accessorial Services-Mobile Home,
  lists all services the carrier is required to provide, including line-haul, payment of tolls, overdimension
  charges, permits and licenses, antisway devices, axles with wheels and tires (rental and replacement),
  temporary lights, and escort services. Claimants may also list damages for shipments before 1
  November 1987 on this form. Note: Not all costs and services may appear on the GBL.
  2.92.4. Beginning 1 November 1987, claimants must list later-discovered damages on DD Form
  1840R, and send them to the carrier within 75 days of delivery. Note: Timely notice on mobile home
  shipments differs slightly from such notice on other shipments. Item 306 of the carrier's rate solic-
  itation states that, "Upon delivery by the carrier, all loss of or damage to the mobile home shall be
  noted on the delivery document, the inventory form, the DD Form 1800, and/or the DD Form 1840.
  Late[r] discovered loss or damage, including personal property within the mobile home, will be
  noted on DD Form 1840R not later than 75 days following delivery and shall be accepted by the
  carrier as overcoming the presumption of correctness of the delivery receipt."
  2.92.5. The carrier and the member prepare DD Form 1412, Inventory of Items Shipped in
  House-Trailer.
  2.92.6. If a Government representative does not inspect the mobile home at delivery, claims personnel
  request an inspection.
  2.92.7. Claims personnel request the mobile home carrier to provide a statement from the driver of
  the towing vehicle within 14 days, explaining the circumstances surrounding the damage and other
  travel details. If the mobile home carrier does not respond, record this fact in the file. Because drivers'
  statements can be self-serving, authorities review them critically to determine whether the carrier is
  incorrectly attributing damage to a latent defect.
  2.92.8. The claimant provides a statement listing:
     2.92.8.1. The age of the mobile home.
     2.92.8.2. The date and place of purchase.
     2.92.8.3. Any prior damage or repairs.
     2.92.8.4. All prior moves.
     2.92.8.5. All prior claims.
  2.92.9. When possible, the claimant obtains two repair estimates from firms in the business of repair-
  ing, rather than selling mobile homes. Such estimates should list:
     2.92.9.1. The approximate value of the home before and after damage.
     2.92.9.2. A detailed breakdown of the repairs needed and their cost.
     2.92.9.3. The cause of damage.
  2.92.10. The claimant needs only one estimate for small claims procedures. Do not use small claims
  procedures if a latent defect may have caused the damage. If the claimant can get only one estimate,
  claims personnel state the reason in the file.
64                                                                            AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     2.92.11. Where the facts indicate the possibility of a latent defect, claims personnel help the claimant
     get a statement explaining the cause of damage from a qualified engineer or vehicle maintenance pro-
     fessional with expertise in mobile homes. Claims personnel coordinate in advance with civil engi-
     neering facilities engineers or local Reserve units with engineering expertise to provide (where
     possible) the necessary inspection.

2.93. Payable Damage. In adjudicating the claim, claims personnel award the claimant compensation
for loss of or damage to the mobile home.
EXCEPTION: Settlement authorities do not pay when the damage is due to:
     2.93.1. A latent defect.
     2.93.2. The member's failure to place the mobile home in fit condition to ship.
     2.93.3. The member's failure to have the roof resealed.
     Compensate the member for the reasonable cost of repair estimates provided by mobile home repair
     firms and opinions prepared by qualified engineers . Do not compensate the claimant for services the
     carrier failed to perform or performed improperly or for other incidental expenses; refer the claimant
     to the transportation office for these matters. Such carrier services (listed on DD Form 1863 and the
     GBL correction notice) include:
     2.93.4. Escort or pilot services, ferry fees, tolls, permits, overdimension charges, or taxes.
     2.93.5. Storage costs or parking fees during travel.
     2.93.6. Expand charges, charges for antisway devices, brakes, and brake repairs, and charges for add-
     ing or replacing axles, tubes, or tires.
     2.93.7. Wrecker services.
     2.93.8. Connecting or disconnecting utilities.
     2.93.9. Blocking, unblocking, or removing or installing skirting.
     2.93.10. The cost of separating or reassembling and resealing a double-wide mobile home.

2.94. Carrier Liability and Attempted Waivers. In the absence of additional coverage, the carrier's
maximum liability for personal property shipped with the mobile home is $250. The carrier is fully liable
for damage to the mobile home itself. Carriers are also liable for damage that third-party contractors (such
as wrecker services) cause. While some carriers may try to obtain waivers from the member, a waiver that
the member signs is not binding on the United States. Because the Air Force is the contracting party, the
owner has no authority to sign a waiver agreement, or any other document exempting the carrier from lia-
bility under the GBL.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                 65


                                               Chapter 3

                                  CARRIER RECOVERY CLAIMS

3.1. Statutes of Limitations:
   3.1.1. International Commercial Air Shipments. The Government must file suit within two years
   after the delivery date. Personnel must notify these carriers of loss or damage in three days for lug-
   gage and seven days for other goods. Claims personnel send uncollectible claims to AFLSA/JACC
   within six months from the date of delivery.
   3.1.2. All Other Carrier Recovery (CR) Claims. The Government must file suit within six years
   after the date when a responsible US official, service member, or employee knew or reasonably should
   have known the material facts that caused the claimed loss. The requirement to file a claim within
   nine months under commercial bills of lading does not apply to GBLs.

3.2. Claims Office Responsibilities. In aiming to provide thorough investigation and documentation,
proper liability computation, and the timely notice essential to a good carrier recovery program, SJAs and
claims officers must:
   3.2.1. Stay aware of current transportation regulations and maintain copies of the Personal Property
   Traffic Management Regulation (PPTMR) on household goods packing and shipping.
   3.2.2. Ensure that claims personnel properly compute carrier liability for the type of shipment
   involved.
   3.2.3. Ensure that carriers receive timely notification of loss and damage via DD Form 1840R.
   3.2.4. Brief TMO personnel regularly on claims and provide them with current claims information to
   give to shippers.
   3.2.5. Review local packing, crating, drayage and storage contracts. Develop a good working rela-
   tionship with TMOs, procurement offices, local carriers, and contractors.

3.3. Basis for Carrier Recovery Claims:
   3.3.1. General Information. The basis for a CR claim is the failure of a carrier, warehouseman, or
   contractor to adequately protect goods entrusted to them for shipment. A carrier must deliver all
   household goods tendered in the same condition as when it took possession of them. The Government
   presents a legally sufficient case of carrier liability when it shows:
       3.3.1.1. That the carrier received the goods in a certain condition.
       3.3.1.2. That the carrier did not deliver the goods, or delivered them in a more damaged condition.
       3.3.1.3. The amount of loss or damage.
   3.3.2. Contractual Liability. The Interstate Commerce Act permits carriers to limit their liability
   by contract. Depending on the type of shipment or services involved, personnel can find the terms of
   the contract in one of three places:
       3.3.2.1. For Government Bill of Lading (GBL) shipments, in the Tender of Service, found in DoD
       Regulation 4500.34, appendix A, and in a rate solicitation or tariff.
66                                                                             AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


        3.3.2.2. For NTS, in the Basic Ordering Agreement, found in DoD Regulation 4500.34, appendix
        M.
        3.3.2.3. For direct procurement method (DPM) shipments, including "pack-and-crate" services at
        origin and destination, in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR).
     3.3.3. Government's and Claimant's Rights. The United States may collect amounts up to the car-
     rier's or warehouse's proven contractual liability. This contract right is independent of any right that
     individuals have to collect from the United States under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employ-
     ees' Claims Act. The United States may collect more than it pays under the Act, if it properly disposes
     of the funds received (that is, pays the excess to the claimant or a private insurer). The claimant is a
     third-party beneficiary to the contract and may receive carrier recoveries, in addition to awards under
     the Personnel Claims Act, up to the adjudicated value of the loss. The Government's contractual
     recovery rights are superior to subrogation claims, such as those that private insurers assert.
     3.3.4. Assignment of Rights by Claimant to United States. The claimant assigns to the United
     States all claim rights against the carrier or contractor by signing a claim form (DD Form 1842 or AF
     Form 180). This assignment:
        3.3.4.1. Creates a right of recovery on behalf of the United States.
        3.3.4.2. Is an alternative method of recovery under the GBL contract.
        3.3.4.3. Assures the carrier that the United States is the sole claimant.
     3.3.5. Claimant's Responsibilities. The claimant must:
        3.3.5.1. Provide any evidence that claims personnel require to support the claim.
        3.3.5.2. Send any payment from the carrier to claims personnel
        3.3.5.3. Not assert a claim against the carrier after receiving payment under the Military Personnel
        and Civilian Employees' Claims Act.
     3.3.6. Setoff. If a carrier fails to pay the Government's claim within 120 days after receiving it (130
     days from the date the claims office sends the demand), the claim is subject to collection by setoff.
     AFLSA/JACC collects claims by setoff through the Defense Finance and Accounting Service
     (DFAS). In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717, the Air Force charges interest payments, administrative
     costs, and penalties on overdue carrier recovery claims for GBL shipments only. Such claims do not
     become overdue until the 210-day mark (120 days plus 90 days). Because claims personnel begin set-
     off before that time, they do not charge costs and penalties in carrier recovery claims.

3.4. Methods of Transportation:
     3.4.1. Through Government Bill of Lading (TGBL). A single GBL procures transportation and
     related services. The carrier is liable for loss and damage sustained at any time during the shipment of
     the property. The various types of shipment are:
        3.4.1.1. Code 1 - Domestic door-to-door, motor van.
        3.4.1.2. Code 2 - Domestic door-to-door, container.
        3.4.1.3. Code 3 -International, door-to-door, container (Test Program)
        3.4.1.4. Code 4 - International door-to-door, container.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                  67


      3.4.1.5. Code 6 - International door-to-door, air container.
      3.4.1.6. Code 7 - International land-water-land (LWL), baggage.
      3.4.1.7. Code 8 - International land-air-land (LAL), baggage.
   3.4.2. GBL with Government Transportation. The Government provides transportation during
   part of the movement, either by Government vessel or Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft.
      3.4.2.1. The types of shipment are:
          3.4.2.1.1. Code 5.
          3.4.2.1.2. Code T.
          3.4.2.1.3. Code J.
      3.4.2.2. Code 5. International door-to-door, container, surface, Government, ocean transporta-
      tion. The carrier delivers the shipment to the Government at the origin port, the Government pal-
      letizes and provides ocean transportation and terminal services, and the carrier transports from the
      destination port to the place of delivery.
      3.4.2.3. Code T. International door-to-door, container, Air Mobility Command (AMC). The car-
      rier provides boxing and crating at origin and transportation to the AMC terminal, AMC transports
      to the destination AMC terminal, and the carrier transports to the place of delivery.
      3.4.2.4. Code J. International land-air(AMC)-land baggage. The carrier palletizes and transports
      to the AMC terminal, AMC transports to the destination AMC terminal, and the carrier transports
      to the place of delivery.
   3.4.3. Direct Procurement Method (DPM) Shipments. The Government:
      3.4.3.1. Arranges transportation through a series of contracts to move the property along a prede-
      termined route.
      3.4.3.2. Issues separate documents for each segment of the move.
      3.4.3.3. Obtains packing and storage services at the point of origin through a local contract or by
      using Government facilities.
      3.4.3.4. Provides shipping containers. Note: Contractors may also provide shipping containers.
      3.4.3.5. Issues a GBL to a line haul or motor freight carrier.
      3.4.3.6. Routes shipments through commercial or Government terminals.
   3.4.4. The Military Sealift Command (MSC), the AMC, or commercial air carriers provide overseas
   transportation. Local contractors or Government facilities provide destination transportation and
   unpacking.

3.5. Claim Forms. Claims personnel complete portions of DD Form 1844 to document carrier recovery
claims.
   3.5.1. Complete the first "Exception" block with all exceptions noted on the origin inventory, if:
      3.5.1.1. The total number of items claimed is 10 or more.
      3.5.1.2. PED is an issue.
68                                                                               AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


         3.5.1.3. They plan to send the claim to JACC.
     3.5.2. Complete the second "Exception" block if a second inventory or rider to the origin inventory
     exists.
     3.5.3. If no subsequent inventories or riders to the origin inventory exist, use the second "Exception"
     block to list the damages that the claimant has noted on DD Form 1840 or 1840R.
     EXCEPTION: Leave the "Weight of Line Item" Block blank on all code 1 or code 2 Shipments.
     3.5.4. Do not write claims inspection comments on the claim forms.
     3.5.5. Review the forms to ensure that the inspection report addresses all exceptions that the carriers
     and the claimant list.

3.6. Demand on Carrier. In making a demand on a carrier, claims personnel must send a demand letter
to the carrier immediately after paying a personnel claims.
     3.6.1. Attach to the letter:
         3.6.1.1. A copy of the GBL, if applicable.
         3.6.1.2. A copy of the adjudicated claim form showing the carrier's liability (The DD Form 1844)
         and the AFCIMS Summary of Adjudication, parts I, III, and IV, not I, II & III.
         3.6.1.3. Repair estimates.
         3.6.1.4. DD Forms 1840 and 1840R.
         3.6.1.5. Inspections.
     3.6.2. Claims personnel assert a claim against a carrier for an amount greater than the Government's
     payment to the claimant when:
         3.6.2.1. A private insurer pays for part of the loss.
         3.6.2.2. The maximum allowances in the Allowance List - Depreciation Guide limit the Govern-
         ment's payment.
         3.6.2.3. The carrier's adjudicated value exceeds the Air Force adjudicated value.
     3.6.3. Pay any excess collection to the claimant or the insurer. Claims personnel do not promise addi-
     tional payment to the claimant before collecting from the carrier.

3.7. Determining Carrier Liability. In determining carrier liability, claims personnel follow five steps:
     3.7.1. Proving a shipment loss occurred.
     3.7.2. Determining who had responsibility for the property at the time of loss.
     3.7.3. Excluding any factors that would relieve the carrier of liability.
     3.7.4. Verifying the type and limit of liability.
     3.7.5. Computing the liability.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                   69


3.8. Proving Shipment Loss. Claims personnel can prove shipment loss, if they find evidence that the
carrier did not deliver all household goods tendered, or that it did not deliver them in the same condition
as at origin.
   3.8.1. Claims personnel use exceptions, which the shipper notes at delivery on DD Form 1840 or
   within 75 days on DD Form 1840R, to show that loss or damage was shipment-related. Note: Refer
   to the Military-Industry Memorandum of Understanding on Loss or Damage Rules, and Chapter 2,
   Section 2L. Failure to note loss or damage on DD Form 1840 or 1840R within 75 days creates a
   presumption that loss or damage was not shipment-related. Do not assert a demand against the
   carrier for any item the claimant did not properly note on DD Form 1840, or a timely DD Form
   1840R.
   EXCEPTION: Claims personnel may assert a demand beforehand when good cause exists to extend
   the DD Form 1840R time period.
       3.8.1.1. The household goods descriptive inventory that the carrier prepares when it accepts the
       goods determines the condition of the shipment at origin. However, if an inspection or other evi-
       dence reveals that the carrier inflated the damages, do not accept a carrier's denial of liability
       based solely on the inventory.

3.9. Responsibility for Property:
   3.9.1. The carrier agrees to accept liability for goods lost or damaged while in its possession. Often
   the party in actual possession of the goods is not the one with legal liability, such as when an agent
   handles a shipment for a through government bill of lading (TGBL) carrier. In a TGBL shipment, the
   Government directs the carrier to move a shipment from one point to another, and the carrier makes all
   the arrangements necessary to meet the transportation requirements. One contract (GBL) exists, and
   the TGBL carrier is solely responsible for loss and damage.
   3.9.2. The Government makes a series of contracts with several contractors for direct procurement
   method (DPM) shipments. Each carrier or contractor is responsible only for the portion it actually
   controls. Note: Often it is difficult to show who had responsibility for the goods when the damage
   occurred.
       3.9.2.1. Each party taking possession of a shipment records its condition in writing. If DPM con-
       tractors do not take exceptions, claims personnel assume that the last one handling the shipment is
       responsible for the loss or damage.
   3.9.3. Carrier responsibility for property generally expires on the 181st day of Storage-in-transit
   (SIT).
   EXCEPTION: The TMO extended the SIT.
       3.9.3.1. Storage charges and liability for loss occurring after the 180th day become the member's
       responsibility. If transportation authorities issue a local contract under the old GBL to deliver the
       property, either the local contractor or the TGBL carrier is liable for the loss. The GBL carrier is
       liable, if it bills the Government for delivery to the member's residence.
   3.9.4. Claims personnel use the household goods descriptive inventory (evidence of a shipment's con-
   dition at a particular time while in possession of a particular carrier) to prove carrier liability.
70                                                                             AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


        3.9.4.1. The carrier may prepare a new inventory reflecting the condition of the goods each time
        a shipment changes hands. Claims personnel ask for multiple inventories for Government claims
        in which more than one party is responsible for a shipment.
        3.9.4.2. The GBL carrier must sign the warehouse's inventory when it removes a shipment from
        nontemporary storage (NTS), but may prepare an exception sheet known as a "rider." Both the
        carrier and warehouse must sign the rider, which controls liability, for the items listed. The GBL
        carrier is liable for any damage or loss not listed on the previous inventory or rider.
        3.9.4.3. Claims personnel resolve disagreements (such as who prepared an inventory or the valid-
        ity of signatures) between a carrier and a warehouse by requesting an advisory opinion from the
        Military Traffic Management Command Regional Storage Management Office (MTMC RSMO)
        of the area where the shipment was stored.
        3.9.4.4. The RSMO contracting officer:
            3.9.4.4.1. Determines the liability between the warehouse and the carrier.
            3.9.4.4.2. Collects any amounts due from the warehouse.
            3.9.4.4.3. Returns the file for any further action against the carrier.
        3.9.4.5. Claims personnel use the contracting officer's determination in settlement negotiations
        with the carrier.
        3.9.4.6. A carrier or contractor may overcome the presumption of liability that the inventory cre-
        ates by presenting convincing proof to the contrary.

3.10. Exemptions from Liability. The claims office determines whether the cause of damage relieves
the carrier of liability.
     3.10.1. DPM contracts have no exclusions from liability. The contractor is liable for any loss or dam-
     age occurring while it possesses the goods.
     3.10.2. Most rate solicitations relieve GBL carriers from liability for certain causes. The exclusionary
     clauses vary. Claims personnel consult the applicable rate solicitation, if a carrier denies liability
     based on an exclusionary clause. To avoid liability, the carrier must prove that a valid exception
     applies. The most common exclusions are:
        3.10.2.1. Acts of God.
        3.10.2.2. Negligence of the owner.
        3.10.2.3. War and nuclear weapons.
        3.10.2.4. Riots and strikes.
        3.10.2.5. Inherent vice of the items, such as furniture made from green, improperly cured wood
        that dries and splits during shipment, or rubber gaskets in washing machines and refrigerators that
        dry out during long periods in storage.
     3.10.3. The exclusions do not apply when the shipper declares increased valuation higher than that set
     forth inThe exclusions do not apply when the shipper declares increased valuation higher than that set
     forth in the basic rate solicitation. Note: See the GBL for this information.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                 71


   3.10.4. The NTS contract states that the warehouse is not liable "for any loss or damage to household
   goods which is caused by acts or conditions beyond its control and without its fault or negligence."
   The contractor must prove it was not negligent in causing the loss.

3.11. Rates of Liability. Claims personnel review the GBL or contact the traffic management office
(TMO) to determine the carrier's or contractor's rate of liability.
The most common liability rates are:
   3.11.1. For TGBL CONUS (including Alaska) shipments, $1.25 times the net weight of the shipment.
   3.11.2. For international TGBL shipments, $1.25 times the net weight of the shipment for shipments
   picked up on or after 1 October 1995.
       3.11.2.1. $.60 per pound per article for shipments picked up before 1 Oct 93.
       3.11.2.2. $1.80 per pound per article for shipments picked up on or after 1 Oct 93 and before 1 Oct
       95.
   3.11.3. For lump sum valuation shipments in CONUS and Alaska only, a member-selected sum
   greater than $1.25 per pound times the net weight of the shipment (option 1).
   3.11.4. For full-replacement protection GBL shipments in CONUS and Alaska only, either $3.50 per
   pound times the net weight of the shipment or $21,000.00, whichever is greater (option 2).
   3.11.5. For GBL international air cargo shipments, $9.07 per pound.
   3.11.6. Compute liability on the packed weight of each item.
   3.11.7. For DPM shipments, including both locally contracted packing, crating, and drayage (that is,
   off-base to on-base moves) and long-distance DPM shipments:
       3.11.7.1. $.60 per pound per article for both packing and crating contractors.
       3.11.7.2. $.10 to $2.50 per pound per article for GBL motor freight carriers.
       3.11.7.3. $1.25 per pound times the net weight of the shipment for local drayage.
   3.11.8. For NTS contractors, $50.00 per inventory line item, prior to 1 Jan 97; $1.25 per pound times
   the net weight of the shipment on or after 1 Jan 97.
       3.11.8.1. Claims personnel contact the MTMC RSMO serving the area where the warehouse is
       located for information on a particular contract.
   3.11.9. For air shipments (hand-carried baggage), claims personnel contact the TMO for baggage lia-
   bility information on commercial and AMC passengers.

3.12. Computing Liability. The carrier is liable on each item for the depreciated replacement cost, the
repair cost, or its contractual liability, whichever is least.
EXCEPTION: For shipments involving full replacement protection, the carrier is liable without regard to
depreciation.
   3.12.1. For claims involving a released value of a specific amount times the net weight of the ship-
   ment ($1.25 times net weight of shipment), claims personnel compute the carrier's liability by multi-
72                                                                              AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     plying the released value times the net weight of the shipment to determine the carrier's maximum
     liability for the shipment.
        3.12.1.1. Hold the carrier liable up to its maximum liability for the repair of, or depreciated
        replacement cost of, items properly noted on DD Forms 1840 or 1840R as damaged or missing,
        after making any necessary adjustments for:
            3.12.1.1.1. Preexisting damage (PED).
            3.12.1.1.2. Non-shipment-related damage, including internal damage.
     3.12.2. For claims involving a released value of a specified amount per pound per article ($.60 per
     pound per article), claims personnel determine what is a single article or item and the weight "per
     pound per article." Note: Each shipping piece or a package with its contents listed as a separate
     entry on the household goods descriptive inventory is an article (for example, a sofa, piano, table,
     or a container, such as a barrel of dishes or a carton of books).
NOTE: The "weight per pound per article" refers to either the weight of an individual item (if not
packed) or of the entire packed container containing the damaged item.
        3.12.2.1. The total parts of an article disassembled for shipment constitute one article for liability
        purposes.
        EXCEPTION: For NTS, the liability is $50.00 per line item for shipments placed into storage
        before 1 Jan 97; $1.25 per pound times the net weight of the shipment after 1 Jan 97.
        3.12.2.2. After locating the article's weight in the Joint Military-Industry Table of Weights or in a
        catalog (if the item's weight is not in the table), multiply the weight by the liability rate to obtain
        the maximum carrier liability.
        3.12.2.3. Reduce the carrier liability as necessary based on:
            3.12.2.3.1. Depreciation.
            3.12.2.3.2. PED.
            3.12.2.3.3. Non-shipment-related damage, including internal damage.
     3.12.3. NOTE : The Allowance List - Depreciation Guide contains some items for which the carrier's
     depreciation rate is less than the depreciation rate that the Air Force uses. In these instances, assert the
     carrier recovery for each item for the higher amount, not the amount that the Air Force paid. Like-
     wise, assert a carrier recovery claim for an amount greater than that paid by the Air Force, if the Air
     Force based its payment on the maximum allowable on that item in accordance with the Allowance
     List - Depreciation Guide. If claims personnel recover the higher amount, they pay the claimant the
     difference.

3.13. Factors Affecting Liability:
     3.13.1. Computing Depreciation. Claims personnel use the rates in the "Carrier Recovery Depreci-
     ation" column of the Allowance List - Depreciation Guide to compute depreciation based on replace-
     ment cost. Note: The carrier industry has agreed to these rates. Some of these rates differ from
     those used for the personnel claim portion of the claim. If no depreciation rate is listed, use the rate
     in the personnel claims column.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                    73


   3.13.2. Preexisting Damage (PED). PED is damage already in existence when the carrier receives
   the property. The carrier must note PED on the inventory at the time of pickup, not at the warehouse
   after pickup. The carrier is not liable for repair of PED.
   EXCEPTION: The carrier is liable if repair of the shipment damage must include the PED.
       3.13.2.1. Where PED forms a major portion of the total damage, claims personnel adjust the claim
       by deducting the cost to repair the old damage, or a reasonable percentage for PED, from the total
       repair or replacement cost. Base this deduction upon the claims office inspection of the item.
   3.13.3. Repair Costs.
       3.13.3.1. For shipments picked up after 1 Jan 92, use the Military-Industry Memorandum of
       Understanding on Loss and Damage Rules (1 Jan 92), if a carrier's itemized estimate obtained
       from a responsible firm is the lowest estimate overall, the claims office must use it when:
           3.13.3.1.1. They receive it before adjudicating the claim.
           3.13.3.1.2. They receive it within 45 days after delivery, even if the claimant has received pay-
           ment.
           3.13.3.1.3. The carrier demonstrates that the claimant's estimate was unreasonable.
       3.13.3.2. Claims personnel do not use carrier provided repair estimates where the repair firm:
           3.13.3.2.1. Does not provide an itemized estimate.
           3.13.3.2.2. Lacks the skill to do the repairs.
           3.13.3.2.3. Cannot perform the work in a timely manner.
           3.13.3.2.4. Is known to provide unreasonable estimates.
           3.13.3.2.5. Is located outside a reasonable distance from the claimant's home.
   3.13.4. Lack of Exceptions. A carrier is not liable for loss or damage not identified at delivery or by
   written notice within 75 days of delivery. EXCEPTIONS:
       3.13.4.1. A carrier is liable if the claimant shows good cause.
       3.13.4.2. A carrier is liable when independent evidence exists of shipment damage.
   3.13.5. Items Packed by Owner (PBO). A carrier is liable for damage to the items in a carton, if it
   accepts a PBO item for shipment. Claims personnel do not accept a carrier's denial of a PBO item.
   3.13.6. Items Picked Up From NTS. A carrier is liable for damage to items in a carton that it picks
   up from an NTS warehouse. EXCEPTION: The carrier is not liable if it creates a separate inventory
   or an exception sheet called a rider, which identifies damage.

3.14. Liability for Code 5 and T Shipments. Because both the Government and the carrier move these
shipments, and it is often not possible to tell who had the property when the loss or damage occurred, the
"50-50" rule is a compromise.
   3.14.1. Claims personnel compute the carrier's liability and assert the claim for 100 percent of that lia-
   bility when no proof exists as to where loss or damage occurred. The Government offers to accept
   payment of 50 percent of the liability, if the carrier pays that amount within 120 days from receipt of
   the claim.
74                                                                           AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     3.14.2. If evidence exists that the loss or damage occurred while either the carrier or the Government
     had control of the shipment, the "50-50" rule does not apply. If the carrier caused the loss or damage,
     settlement authorities assert for 100 percent of liability. If the damage or loss occurred under Govern-
     ment control, assert no claim against the carrier.

3.15. Liability for Code J Shipments:
     3.15.1. Carriers agree to assume full liability for Code J shipments, even if loss occurs during Gov-
     ernment handling.
        3.15.1.1. Claims personnel consult the GBL for the proper shipment code. Do not confuse these
        shipments with DPM shipments.
     3.15.2. Claims personnel use the Joint Military-Industry Table of Weights to determine liability for
     unaccompanied baggage shipments being shipped as Code J.
     The carrier conducts an inventory of Code J shipments in a similar manner to Code 4 shipments.
        3.15.2.1. For items packed in internal cartons whose size is properly noted on the inventory, deter-
        mine the weight by referring to the Table of Weights.
        3.15.2.2. For items packed in internal cartons whose size is not properly noted on the inventory,
        determine the weight by referring to the notes at the end of the Table of Weights. Note: These
        notes require that claims personnel assign a weight to unidentified cartons according to contents,
        but do not permit a weight of less than 25 pounds.
        3.15.2.3. For items not packed in internal cartons, but with an assigned weight in the Table of
        Weights, determine the weight by referring to the Table of Weights, including the notes for items
        whose dimensions are not properly specified.
        3.15.2.4. For items that are normally packed in internal cartons under the Tender of Service or
        other appropriate MTMC guidance, but not listed on the inventory as being packed in a carton,
        determine the weight by applying the most likely carton size that would contain these items (for
        example, dishes in a dishpack or clothes in a wardrobe).
        3.15.2.5. For single items not normally packed in internal cartons and not listed separately in the
        Table of Weights, or for bundles of items such as brooms, rakes, tools, fishing poles, and so on,
        determine the weight of the items by using the stated or appropriate bundle size weight listed in
        the Table of Weights.
        3.15.2.6. If claims personnel cannot establish liability by any of the above methods (usually when
        the inventory significantly fails to identify how the items were packed), they use the gross weight
        of the relevant shipping container.

3.16. Liability for DPM Shipments:
     3.16.1. Claims personnel identify DPM shipments by examining the GBL. A shipment is a DPM if:
        3.16.1.1. The two-letter service code begins with "B" or "H." Note: See DoD Regulation
        4500.34, appendix G, for an explanation of DPM Codes.
        3.16.1.2. The letters "DPM" appear.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                    75


      3.16.1.3. The GBL liability rate is $0.10 to $2.50 per pound per article. Note: Only DPM motor
      freight carriers have this liability rate.
      3.16.1.4. A carrier or TMO delivers the shipment to either a carrier or a TMO.
      3.16.1.5. The GBL carrier is a motor freight carrier, rather than a household goods mover. Note:
      The Domestic and Mobile Home Personal Property Carrier Approvals book that MTMC pub-
      lishes does not list motor freight carriers.
   3.16.2. Because several contractors handle DPM shipments, claims personnel hold the destination
   contractor liable, if there is no specific evidence showing which contractor caused the loss or damage.
   The destination contractor may overcome the presumption of liability with:
      3.16.2.1. Exception sheets.
      3.16.2.2. A TMO opinion of improper packing.
      3.16.2.3. Other convincing evidence showing that another party is responsible.
      The exceptions that a carrier lists must be specific and relate directly to the type of damage
      claimed.
   3.16.3. Claims personnel assess the rate of liability, based on which of the contractors is liable. Ori-
   gin and destination contractors are liable at $0.60 per pound per article. Motor freight carriers are lia-
   ble at $0.10 to $2.50 per pound per article.
   3.16.4. Claims personnel use the procedures set forth in the DPM contract to resolve disputes that
   contractors raise over the weights of an article. Consider each separately packaged item listed as a
   line item on the household goods descriptive inventory as an article for DPM purposes. Do not con-
   sider the shipping crate or external container to be an article. If the inventory lists several shipping
   containers with a general description of their contents, consider each shipping container to be an arti-
   cle.

3.17. Liability for Mobile Homes:
   3.17.1. A carrier is liable for the fair market value of the mobile home and its built-in equipment and
   for items transported in the mobile home up to $250, or a greater amount if it is listed on the GBL.
   3.17.2. Carriers move most mobile homes under a TGBL. The carrier:
      3.17.2.1. Plans the move.
      3.17.2.2. Moves the mobile home from origin to destination.
      3.17.2.3. Complies with state and interstate regulations.
      3.17.2.4. Delivers the mobile home to an accessible site.
   3.17.3. The carrier must inspect the mobile home to determine if it is road-worthy. The mobile home
   owner corrects defective conditions to the carrier's satisfaction.
   The TMO resolves disputes between the carrier and the owner. The carrier assumes the risk of ship-
   ment damage caused by any defect it discovers, or should have discovered but fails to correct.
   3.17.4. The carrier must deliver the mobile home in the same condition in which the owner offered it
   for shipment at the point of origin, or pay the damages. Exceptions to liability are:
76                                                                            AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


        3.17.4.1. Normal wear and tear.
        3.17.4.2. Mechanical failure.
        3.17.4.3. Undiscovered structural defects.
        3.17.4.4. Acts of God.
     3.17.5. The owner may purchase Act of God insurance. Claims personnel note the purchase of insur-
     ance on the GBL.
     3.17.6. The carrier must present supporting evidence to prove it is not liable for shipment damage.
     The carrier has the burden of proof.
        3.17.6.1. Because carriers often deny liability by alleging structural damage and may claim that
        all mobile homes sustain damage when moved, claims personnel do not accept a simple written
        allegation from the carrier. The carrier must prove that the mobile home was of poor construction
        and that the poor construction was the sole cause of damage.
        3.17.6.2. Claims personnel must be prepared to answer the carrier's allegation with the same evi-
        dence as they originally gathered to support shipment loss and approve the claimant's personnel
        claim. Contact the mobile home manufacturer, if the carrier refuses to pay the Government's
        claim because of poor construction or a structural defect in the mobile home.
     3.17.7. With DPM shipments to Alaska, responsibilities vary. Claims personnel carefully review the
     shipment documents and check with the TMO to pinpoint liability.

3.18. Monitoring Carrier Recovery Claims:
     3.18.1. A carrier, warehouse, or contractor must respond in 120 days after receiving a claim in one of
     four ways:
        3.18.1.1. Pay the claim.
        3.18.1.2. Deny the claim.
        3.18.1.3. Make a firm settlement offer.
        3.18.1.4. Explain the reason for delay in doing any of these things.
     3.18.2. Claims personnel promptly answer all correspondence from the carrier, such as offers of set-
     tlement and requests for information. In accordance with the Military-Industry Memorandum of
     Understanding on Loss and Damage Rules (1 Jan 92), if the carrier makes an offer to settle within 90
     days of receiving the demand, claims offices may not set off a claim without giving the carrier a writ-
     ten response.
     3.18.3. Ninety days after asserting the claim, claims personnel send a letter to the carrier informing it
     that unless the parties involved can settle the claim within 30 days, the claims office will begin a set-
     off.

3.19. Carrier Recovery Checks:
     3.19.1. Checks Received During Settlement Negotiations:
        3.19.1.1. Claims personnel send satisfactory settlement checks to the local AFO within five work-
        days of receipt, with DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, for deposit into the current
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                       77


       claims fund account. Maintain suspense copies of approved cash collection vouchers. Ensure that
       the dollar amounts on the vouchers that the AFO returns match the amounts on the suspense cop-
       ies, and initial the returned voucher to indicate a proper match. File the initialed, receipted
       voucher copy in the claim file and close the claim.
       3.19.1.2. Claims personnel retain unsatisfactory settlement checks until receiving an acceptable
       settlement. Forward unsatisfactory checks to AFLSA/JACC when submitting claim files for set-
       off.
       3.19.1.3. Claims personnel retain checks with an expired time limit. Do not deposit them. Return
       old checks and request new ones, if carriers make satisfactory settlement after the time limit
       expires.
   3.19.2. Checks Received after Sending the Claim File for Setoff. Upon receiving a check after
   sending the claim file for setoff, claims personnel contact the office with the claim file (AFLSA/
   JACC, MTMC RSMO, or contracting office) for instructions. Do not deposit the check, unless the
   appropriate office returns the file. AFLSA/JACC does not return any files for check-cashing purposes
   after a base sends the file to AFLSA/JACC for setoff action against a GBL carrier. Return the check
   to the carrier, if AFLSA/JACC has already begun setoff action.

3.20. Setoff. Claims personnel make a diligent effort to collect carrier recovery claims before sending
them for setoff. Do not routinely settle for less than the full amount of the carrier's liability. An offer does
not stop the 120-day period. Compromise only for a computation error or a compelling reason in the best
interests of the Air Force.
   3.20.1. Claims personnel send claims for setoff when the carrier:
       3.20.1.1. Denies the claim or makes an unacceptable final offer. The settlement authority may
       send the file immediately upon receiving a denial or unacceptable final offer. Consider a carrier's
       rejection of further negotiations as a final denial.
       3.20.1.2. Fails to pay, denies a claim, or makes a firm settlement offer for less than the full amount
       within 130 days from the date the claims office sends the claim to the carrier. If negotiations are
       current, active, and potentially favorable, the settlement authority may keep the claim for 180
       days.
   3.20.2. Claims personnel submit files for setoff differently, according to the type of carrier.
       3.20.2.1. Send claims against GBL carriers to AFLSA/JACC. Send a transmittal letter and two
       copies, using the setoff letter format in the Claims Adjudicator's Handbook. When sending docu-
       ments or requesting information on files sent to AFLSA/JACC for setoff, provide the claimant's
       name, the complete claim number, the carrier's name and Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC),
       and the date the file was sent to JACC.
       3.20.2.2. Send claims against NTS contractors to the proper MTMC headquarters office, as
       shown on the MTMC RSMO map, using the appropriate setoff letter format in the Claims Adjudi-
       cator's Handbook.
       3.20.2.3. Send claims against DPM contractors, both local and international, to the contracting
       officer who administers the contract for the responsible carrier. Follow the disputes clause of the
       FAR for DPM contract claims. This clause requires the contracting officer to issue a written final
78                                                                              AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


        decision in any case involving the collection of contract claims. (See FAR section 52.233-1, 48
        CFR 52.233-1.)
        3.20.2.4. Maintain a "shell" file for NTS and DPM claims sent for setoff. Ensure that it contains
        at least one copy of the transmittal letter. Request the status from the appropriate officer 45 days
        after sending the file for setoff and every 30 days thereafter.
        3.20.2.5. Copy the pertinent documents for files with multiple CR claims. Make another file, or
        use the shell file, to pursue active CRs.

3.21. AFLSA/JACC Setoff Determinations. AFLSA/JACC evaluates carrier recovery claims for
administrative offset on a case-by-case basis to determine whether it is in the best interest of the United
States to collect the claim by administrative setoff and whether collection will prove successful and
cost-efficient.
     3.21.1. The remedy of setoff is a well-settled principle of common law that permits any creditor to
     apply money that it owes the debtor toward paying off what the debtor owes the creditor. Note: The
     Interstate Commerce Act does not affect the Government's common law right of setoff. When the
     United States decides to use setoff, only the requirements of procedural due process limit its action.
     In the case of carrier recovery claims, claims offices meet these requirements when they send the
     carrier a demand and relevant claims documents, and give the carrier an appropriate period of time
     to respond.
     3.21.2. If the carrier requests a review of the determination of indebtedness within a reasonable
     period of time, AFLSA/JACC reviews the record before determining to collect the claim by adminis-
     trative setoff. If AFLSA/JACC determines administrative setoff is in the Government's best interest,
     it informs the carrier that it plans to collect the claim by administrative setoff, including interest, pen-
     alties, and administrative costs, as appropriate. AFLSA/JACC then requests the Defense Finance and
     Accounting Center to collect the claim, interest, penalties, and administrative costs, as appropriate.

3.22. Uncollectible Carrier Recovery Claims:
     3.22.1. The Government cannot generally collect loss and damage claims directly from carriers who
     have filed for reorganization or bankruptcy.
     3.22.2. AFLSA/JACC pursues collection through bankruptcy courts, cargo liability insurance compa-
     nies, or the General Services Administration.
     3.22.3. AFLSA/JACC sends a message directing all Air Force claims offices with open, uncollectible
     claims against a particular carrier to send them to AFLSA/JACC. Claims personnel settle the person-
     nel claims portion of each claim, accurately compute and promptly assert carrier liability, and send the
     claim to AFLSA/JACC in a properly labeled folder.

3.23. Dividing Carrier Collections With the Insurance Company:
     3.23.1. Claims personnel assert the carrier recovery claim for the full amount of the carrier's liability,
     even if an insurance company pays the full amount for an item. If an insurer pays a portion of a claim,
     pay that company its prorated share of the carrier recovery. Make these payments to the insurer
     whether or not the insurer requests them. Pay the insurance company only when the total due on a
     claim is more than $25.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                    79


   3.23.2. Air Force and Insurer Each Paying Part of a Claim:
       3.23.2.1. If there was a lump sum or non-itemized insurance payment, claims personnel prorate
       the collection from the carrier according to the total sum that each party paid on the whole claim.
       Find the percentage of the total the insurer paid. Pay the insurer that percentage of the carrier col-
       lection.
       3.23.2.2. If there was an itemized insurance payment, claims personnel prorate the collection
       from the carrier according to the total sum that each party paid on each item. Find the percentage
       of the amount the insurer paid on a given item.
       Pay the insurer that percentage of the amount recovered from the carrier for that item.
       3.23.2.3. Claims personnel keep the full amount collected from the carrier for an item that the Air
       Force paid for entirely. Pay the insurer the full amount collected from the carrier for an item that
       the insurer paid for entirely.
       3.23.2.4. Deposit the total amount received from the carrier in the local AFO. Reimburse the
       insurance company, using a separate payment voucher.

3.24. Claims That Should Not Be Asserted. In accordance with an agreement that military claims ser-
vices and representatives of the carrier industry have signed, the Air Force does not assert carrier recovery
claims for sums less than $25.00. In addition, carriers do not request military claims services to make
refunds on claims for carrier overpayments of less than $25.00.

3.25. Unearned Transportation Charges
   3.25.1. A carrier is not entitled to payment for any part of the shipment lost or damaged beyond
   repair. The Joint Personal Property Shipping Office (JPPSO), JPPSO-SAT/XOP, 613 NW Loop 410
   Suite 400, 8961 Tesoro Drive, Suite 300, San Antonio TX 78216-5518, collects unearned transporta-
   tion charges for all Air Force shipments except for DPM and NTS shipments. Claims personnel take
   the following steps to recoup unearned transportation charges.
       3.25.1.1. After settlement of any carrier recovery claim for items missing or damaged beyond
       repair as a result of household goods or unaccompanied baggage shipment, or if a mobile home is
       damaged beyond repair, mail one copy of the DD Form 1843 or the CR Claim Assertion Letter,
       together with the DD Form 1844 or AF Form(s) 180/180A, AFCIMS adjudication sheet(s), and a
       copy of the GBL to JPPSO-SAT/XOP. Prior to forwarding the claims package to JPPSO, mark
       the dollar amount paid by the carrier for each item missing or damaged beyond repair with a high-
       lighter marker. Claims which involve repairable items only are not forwarded to JPPSO.
       3.25.1.2. If the carrier has not offered a satisfactory settlement within 130 days of assertion, and
       the claim is being forwarded to AFLSA/JACC for setoff, mail one copy of the DD Form 1843 or
       the CR Claim Assertion Letter, together with the DD Form 1844 or AF Form(s) 180/180A,
       AFCIMS adjudication sheet(s), and a copy of the GBL to JPPSO-SAT/XOP at the same time the
       claim is forwarded to AFLSA/JACC. Prior to forwarding the package to JPPSO, and the file to
       AFLSA/JACC, mark the dollar amount paid by the Air Force for each item missing or damage
       beyond repair with a highlighter marker. Claims which involve repairable items only are not for-
       warded to JPPSO.
80                                                                   AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     3.25.1.3. When preparing a package to be forwarded to JPPSO for any reason, use a black marker
     to line through any item(s) on the AF Form(s) 180/180A, DD Form 1844 , and AFCIMS adjudi-
     cation sheet, for which the carrier should not be held liable.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                    81


                                                Chapter 4

         PROPERTY DAMAGE TORT CLAIMS IN FAVOR OF THE UNITED STATES

4.1. Scope. This chapter describes the principles and procedures by which the United States asserts and
collects claims for damage to its property through someone's negligence or wrongful act. Refer to these
claims as "Government" or "G" claims. As a property owner, the Air Force is often the victim of a tort
and has the right under the Federal Claims Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3701, 3711-3719, to collect for tor-
tious damages. It is Air Force policy to aggressively pursue property damage claims. Each supervisory
claims authority must ensure that its personnel promptly discover all potential claims under this chapter
and fully investigate and vigorously pursue them. This chapter does not cover maritime claims in favor of
the United States or hospital recovery claims.

4.2. Assertable Claims. Claims personnel may assert claims against a tortfeasor for loss or damage to
Government property in these instances:
   4.2.1. Assert a claim if the loss or damage to Government property is for $100 or more. If the loss or
   damage is less than $100, assert the claim if it can be collected easily.
   4.2.2. Assert a claim if it is based on a contract and the contracting officer does not intend to assert a
   claim under the contract. Document the contracting officer's decision not to assert a claim for the file.
   If a difference of opinion exists between the claims office and the contracting office as to whether the
   claim is assertable, or whether it should be pursued through procurement or claims channels, docu-
   ment the disagreement and send the claim to AFLSA/JACC.
   4.2.3. Assert claims for property loss or damage if the claim arises from the same incident as a hospi-
   tal recovery claim. Process the two claims separately, but investigate them together.
   4.2.4. If the tortfeasor or his insurer presents a claim against the Government arising from the same
   incident, assert a claim. Process both the pro-Government and anti-Government tort claims together.
   4.2.5. Assert the claim as a counterclaim under an international agreement. Assert these claims in
   accordance with AFI 51-501, chapter 4.
   4.2.6. Due to the unique nature of product liability issues and claims litigation, obtain AFLSA/JACC
   approval before asserting a claim, using a products liability theory of recovery.

4.3. Nonassertable Claims . Claims personnel do not assert a claim for loss or damage of Government
property in these instances:
   4.3.1. Do not assert a claim for reimbursement against military or civilian employees for claims paid
   by the United States due to that employee's negligence.
   4.3.2. Do not assert claims for loss or damage that a nonappropriated fund employee causes to Gov-
   ernment property while on the job, or caused by a Government employee with accountability for the
   property under the report of survey system.
   4.3.3. Do not assert a claim for loss or damage to nonappropriated fund property that is assertable
   under other parts of this instruction.
   4.3.4. Do not assert a claim for monies to be recovered from a foreign government or any of its polit-
   ical subdivisions. AFLSA/JACC may authorize exceptions to this rule.
82                                                                           AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


4.4. Asserting the Claim. After investigating the incident giving rise to a potential property damage
claim, and after identifying the appropriate tortfeasors, the base SJA asserts the claim against the tortfea-
sors by sending via certified mail, return receipt requested, the original and one copy of a Notice of
Claim. The notice provides sufficient notification of the facts and circumstances surrounding the inci-
dent, including:
     4.4.1. A reference to the statutory right of the United States under the Federal Claims Collection Act
     to collect for the loss or damage.
     4.4.2. A demand for payment for loss or damage to the property, or a demand for the restoration of
     that property.
     4.4.3. A description of the loss or damage.
     4.4.4. The date and place of the incident giving rise to the claim.
     4.4.5. The name, office address, and telephone number of the claims personnel to contact regarding
     the claim.

4.5. Referring a Claim to US Attorney or DoJ. If collection efforts are unsuccessful, the SJA may
refer a claim to the US Attorney or the DoJ for initiation of a lawsuit. Send no claim to the US Attorney
or the DoJ without prior AFLSA/JACC approval. Contact AFLSA/JACC to discuss referral of the claim.

4.6. Statute of Limitations. The United States must file a lawsuit for loss or damage of Government
property, based in tort, within three years after the date when a responsible official of the United States
knew or reasonably should have known the material facts that resulted in the claimed loss. (See 28 U.S.C.
2415b.) Note: Suits based in contract, or upon some other theory or upon state law, may have a differ-
ent statute of limitations period. The SJA ensures the correct governing statute is applied.
     4.6.1. Claims personnel must never lose a claim due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.

4.7. Compromise, Termination, and Suspension of Collection:
     4.7.1. In order to maximize collections for the United States, settlement authorities may agree to a
     compromise settlement when:
        4.7.1.1. The tortfeasor is unable to pay the full amount within a reasonable time. Obtain a sworn
        statement showing the debtor's assets and liabilities, income, expenses, and insurance coverage,
        and include it in the claim file.
        4.7.1.2. The Government is unable to collect a claim in full within a reasonable time, even though
        it has used enforced collection proceedings.
        4.7.1.3. The cost to collect does not justify enforced collection in the full amount.
        4.7.1.4. The Government might have difficulty proving its case in court for the full amount
        claimed, if a question exists about the tortfeasor's liability or a problem arises in proving the
        amount and extent of damages to the United States.
     4.7.2. Settlement authorities may not compromise in cases of fraud, misrepresentation, or violation of
     antitrust laws. The DoJ must authorize compromise of such claims.
     4.7.3. The SJA may terminate all collection efforts when:
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                    83


       4.7.3.1. The Government is unable to collect the debt after exhausting all collection methods.
       4.7.3.2. Claims personnel cannot locate the tortfeasor.
       4.7.3.3. The cost to collect will exceed recovery.
       4.7.3.4. The claim is legally without merit.
       4.7.3.5. The evidence does not adequately prove the claim.
   4.7.4. The SJA may suspend collection action when authorities cannot locate the tortfeasor or the tort-
   feasor is unable to pay, but future collection may be possible.

4.8. Reporting Potential Claims. Personnel report to AFLSA/JACC by message all incidents involv-
ing damage to or loss of Government property that may result in liability of a third party in excess of
$10,000. (See paragraph 1.6.7. RCS: HAF-JA (AR) 8302.)

4.9. Investigating the Claim. Claims personnel aim to conduct timely, thorough investigations of
potential claims.
   4.9.1. Thoroughly document the claim file and include, when applicable, witness statements, copies
   of other investigations, correspondence with the tortfeasor, insurance information, a report on the tort-
   feasor's financial status, and a summary of any applicable law.
   4.9.2. Include in the file evidence of loss or actual damage and costs of repair (including materials and
   overhead) or replacement of Government property. If the cost of labor and overhead is based on a
   Government regulation, directive, or technical order, include the appropriate portions of that docu-
   ment in the file.
       4.9.2.1. Include in this file evidence of consequential damages (loss of use, removal to storage,
       and storage costs), if any. Support with evidence the calculation of those damages, and include
       this information in the file.

4.10. Monitoring the Claim. After claims personnel assert the claim, the base SJA ensures that person-
nel monitor the claim and aggressively follow up. If the tortfeasor fails to respond to two letters at 30-day
intervals, or claims personnel cannot obtain the full settlement, the SJA sends the file to AFLSA/JACC
with a recommendation for disposition.
   4.10.1. If claims personnel do not receive payment within 18 months from the incident date, or if
   there is indication of fraud or misrepresentation by the tortfeasor, the SJA refers the file to the US
   Attorney or the DoJ. The SJA coordinates with AFLSA/JACC to discuss the file and the reasons for
   referral.
       4.10.1.1. After referring the claim to the US Attorney, the SJA periodically queries the US Attor-
       ney to determine the status of the claim if the SJA receives no report. The SJA advises AFLSA/
       JACC, if the US Attorney refuses to file suit or is unsuccessful in securing payment.
   4.10.2. The SJA notifies AFLSA/JACC when a foreign country voluntarily offers to pay a claim, or
   offers to repair or replace the lost or damaged property.

4.11. Reporting Litigation. Claims personnel keep AFLSA/JACC informed when a pro-Government
claim goes into litigation, because the litigation might have a wide-ranging policy implications. Submit a
84                                                                             AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


report to AFLSA/JACC in the litigation report format described in AFI 51-501. Include a copy of the
pleadings, along with the litigation report. As significant litigation events occur, notify AFLSA/JACC.
When the litigation is complete, send a final report detailing the results. (See paragraph 1.6.7. RCS:
HAF-JA (AR) 8302.)

4.12. Collecting and Disposing of Claims. Claims personnel collect and dispose of tort claims in favor
of the Government.
     4.12.1. When a third party offers full payment or an acceptable compromise on a claim within the
     base's settlement authority, accept the offer and prepare a release, if requested.
     4.12.2. When a third party offers to pay the debt in installments (either in the full amount or an
     acceptable compromise), and the claim is within the base settlement authority, the SJA may accept the
     debt, if the third party can repay it within a reasonable time and the compromise does not release any
     joint tortfeasor. Prepare a confession of judgment (cognovit) note, which details the repayment sched-
     ule, and have the tortfeasor execute it. Carefully follow the claim to ensure that the third party makes
     payment according to the schedule.
        4.12.2.1. Claims personnel keep the file until the third party has made full payment according to
        the terms. If the third party is delinquent in making an installment payment, write a demand letter
        reminding the third party of the obligation to pay.
        Continue collection efforts for no more than 90 days after the account becomes delinquent, and
        then send the file to AFLSA/JACC with a recommendation for appropriate disposition.
     4.12.3. The settlement authority may accept a third party's offer to repair or replace the damaged
     property. The third party repairs or replaces the property to the satisfaction of the accountable prop-
     erty officer.
        4.12.3.1. Because the repair or replacement does not require spending operational funds and lost
        or damaged property is restored or becomes reusable, claims personnel should strive to arrange
        this procedure.
     4.12.4. When a party refuses to pay voluntarily, settlement authorities implement setoff action to col-
     lect claims, if all parties have agreed upon the tortfeasor's liability or the claim is subject to liquida-
     tion. The United States has the same right as any other creditor to apply money of the debtor toward
     paying off a debt. The United States may administratively set off a liquidated tort claim against an
     amount that it owes to the claimant.
     4.12.5. When two or more tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable, settlement authorities may
     divide the payment between the tortfeasors. Take care that a compromise with one tortfeasor does not
     release the claims against the remaining responsible parties.

4.13. Prejudgment Interest. A settlement authority may waive prejudgment interest (where statute,
contract, or regulation do not require it) to encourage payment. Inform the tortfeasor that the United
States will seek such interest in the event of litigation.

4.14. Depositing Collections. Claims personnel deposit collections. (See 31 U.S.C. 3302, 10 U.S.C.
2831.)
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                               85


  4.14.1. Deposit collections for loss, damage, or destruction to Air Force family housing, caused by
  abuse or negligence, to the DoD Military Family Housing Management Account 57*7045. Note:
  Insert the last digit of the current fiscal year for the *.
  4.14.2. Deposit collections for loss, damage, or destruction to other real property to the appropriate
  funds account of the organization responsible for the repair, maintenance, or replacement of the real
  property.
  4.14.3. Deposit collections for loss, damage, or destruction to property under control of an Air Force
  Industrial Fund (AFIF) to the appropriate industrial fund account.
  4.14.4. Pay or deposit claims involving NAFI property, in accordance with paragraph 1.4.8.
  4.14.5. Deposit all other collections to the US Treasury Miscellaneous Receipts Account 57*3019.
  Note: Insert the last digit of the current fiscal year for the *.

                                                  Chapter 5

                                   HOSPITAL RECOVERY CLAIMS

5.1. Scope. This chapter explains how the United States asserts and settles claims for costs of medical
care against third parties under the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (FMCRA), 42 U.S.C. 2651-2653;
the Coordination of Benefits (COB) Program, 10 U.S.C. 1095; and other laws. Refer to claims under this
chapter as "HR" claims.

5.2. Assertable Claims.
     5.2.1. In keeping with the Air Force policy of aggressive collection of pro-Government claims, each
     settlement authority may assert a claim in any amount. Assert a claim only if the SJA determines that
     it merits assertion. If the Air Force has furnished or will furnish medical care in military health care
     facilities or has reimbursed a private care provider, assert a claim if:
        5.2.1.1. A third party is liable in tort for causing an injury or disease.
        5.2.1.2. Federal, state or foreign law permits the United States to recover.
        5.2.1.3. The United States is a third-party beneficiary under uninsured motorist coverage, medical
        payments insurance coverage, no-fault statutes, workers' compensation, or other statutes.
        5.2.1.4. The United States has a statutory right of recovery against a third party.
     5.2.2. Coordination of Benefits (COB) Claims. Comply with 10 U.S.C. 1095 for recovering med-
     ical care expenses. Claims personnel return money collected in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1095 to
     the military treatment facility (MTF) at which the sick or injured party received care.
        5.2.2.1. MTFs conduct active programs of asserting and collecting claims against health insur-
        ance companies of retirees and dependents for inpatient and outpatient care. A claims office may
        get involved with these COB claims, if the MTF is unable to collect from an insurer. The MTF
        submits the case file to the claims office for review and follow-up, if appropriate. The SJA takes
        steps necessary to collect the claim, including referral to the US Attorney in appropriate cases.
        5.2.2.2. Claims offices use 10 U.S.C. 1095 as the primary statutory basis of recovery against var-
        ious types of automobile insurance. Note: The statute is particularly helpful in "no-fault"
        insurance states that have eliminated traditional tort liability. Use this statute to authorize col-
        lection from an entity that provides insurance, medical service, or a health plan by contract or
        agreement. This includes automobile liability insurance and no-fault insurance.
     5.2.3. Settlement authorities only assert those claims for $150 or less in which:
        5.2.3.1. They determine that the collection will exceed the cost to collect.
        5.2.3.2. The third party offers payment.
        5.2.3.3. The United States asserts a property damage claim under Chapter 4 arising out of the
        same incident.

5.3. Nonassertable Claims. Settlement authorities do not assert:
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                    87


   5.3.1. Claims against any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States. These include
   any self-insured nonappropriated fund activity (revenue-producing, welfare, or other). They do not
   include private organizations.
   5.3.2. Claims for care that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides a veteran for a ser-
   vice-connected disability. Assert claims for the reasonable value of medical care that an Air Force
   member receives before discharge and transfer to the VA facility.
   5.3.3. Claims for care that the US furnishes a merchant seaman in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 249. Do
   not file a claim against the seaman's employer.
   5.3.4. Claims involving Government contractors, foreign governments, US personnel, and products
   liability without first obtaining AFLSA/JACC approval.
      5.3.4.1. If the United States must reimburse the contractor for a claim according to the terms of
      the contract, settlement authorities investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident to deter-
      mine if assertion is appropriate. If the United States is not required to reimburse the contractor, the
      SJA may assert a claim against the contractor. The SJA carefully reviews the contract to deter-
      mine the feasibility of asserting such a claim.
      5.3.4.2. Settlement authorities investigate any claims that might be made against foreign govern-
      ments, their political subdivisions, armed forces members, or civilian employees. Send the claim
      file containing the investigation to AFLSA/JACC along with the SJA's recommendation.
      AFLSA/JACC decides if a claim is appropriate.
      5.3.4.3. Settlement authorities do not assert claims against members of the uniformed services,
      employees of the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, or a dependent of a service mem-
      ber or employee.
      EXCEPTION: Settlement authorities assert claims against persons or organizations which have
      insurance to cover the Air Force's claim.
      EXCEPTION: Settlement authorities may assert a claim against a service member, a Federal
      civilian employee, or dependents whose willful misconduct or gross negligence results in medical
      treatment provided at Government expense.
      5.3.4.4. P roducts Liability. Due to the unique nature of product liability issues and claims litiga-
      tion, settlement authorities get AFLSA/JACC approval before asserting a claim, using a products
      liability theory of recovery.

5.4. Asserting the Claim.
   5.4.1. The SJA asserts a claim against the tortfeasors, using SF 96, Notice of Claim. Send a copy to
   each tortfeasor and the tortfeasor's insurance company, if known. Assert a non-tort-based claim, using
   a formal letter on Air Force stationery. In the demand letter, clearly state the legal basis for recovery
   and sufficiently identify the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident giving rise to the medi-
   cal care. Applicable bases of recovery include local foreign law, US status as a third-party beneficiary
   under various types of insurance policies, workers' compensation laws, no-fault laws, or other Federal
   statutes, including 10 U.S.C. 1095.
88                                                                             AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


        5.4.1.1. If the amount of the claim asserted is in excess of $5,000, send the demand via certified
        mail, return receipt requested. If a tortfeasor or other third party fails to respond within a reason-
        able period of time, send a second notice of claim also by certified mail, return receipt requested.
     5.4.2. The SJA or claims officer promptly notifies the injured party, in writing, that the United States
     will attempt to recover from a third party the reasonable value of medical care furnished or to be fur-
     nished. The SJA or claims officer may advise the injured party to seek advice from a legal assistance
     officer or civilian counsel. Notify injured parties of their required cooperation in the prosecution of all
     actions by the United States against third parties. Advise them that they must give a complete state-
     ment regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident giving rise to the medical care.
     Advise injured parties not to sign a release or settle any claim resulting from the incident without first
     notifying the claims office.

5.5. Referring a Claim to the US Attorney. Only AFLSA/JACC may authorize referral of a claim to
the US Attorney.
     5.5.1. The base SJA ensures that personnel review all claims for possible referral not later than two
     years after the date of the incident.
     5.5.2. Personnel send unsettled claims, with the SJA's recommendation, to AFLSA/JACC.
     5.5.3. AFLSA/JACC may authorize (by telephone) referral of a case to the US Attorney.

5.6. Statute of Limitations. A claim of the United States is subject to 28 U.S.C. 2415-2416. The United
States, or the injured party on behalf of the United States, must file suit, based on tort, within three years
after a Federal medical facility first provides treatment or after the Civilian Health and Medical Program
of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) makes the initial payment. File suits based in contract within six
years.
     5.6.1. The SJA ensures that personnel apply the correct governing statute.

5.7. Recovery Rates. Settlement authorities consult the Federal Register for the rates for medical care
costs in US Government MTFs, which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) or the Secretary of
Defense sets. OMB publishes the rates at the beginning of the Federal Government fiscal year. The med-
ical expenses that authorities pay to private health care providers are the actual dollar cost of that care.
While third parties usually may not challenge the rates (a substitution of local rates is possible under 10
U.S.C. 1095), they may challenge the necessity for the care and treatment that the MTF provided.

5.8. Waiver and Compromise. The United States may waive or compromise its interest when it cannot
collect a claim in full. An injured party or its representative requests a waiver or compromise in writing,
and sufficiently states the reasons for the requested waiver or compromise.
     5.8.1. The United States, for its own convenience, may waive a claim when it cannot locate the tort-
     feasor, the tortfeasor cannot pay or has refused to pay, collection costs outweigh potential recovery, or
     the case is too weak for litigation. Settlement authorities waive these claims when they see fit.
     5.8.2. Settlement authorities may also waive or compromise claims when collection would cause an
     undue hardship on the injured party or when litigation risks or other factors warrant. In determining
     whether or not to waive such a claim consider these factors concerning the injured party:
        5.8.2.1. Permanent disability or disfigurement.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                      89


       5.8.2.2. Decreased earning power.
       5.8.2.3. Out-of-pocket expenses.
       5.8.2.4. Financial status.
       5.8.2.5. Pension rights.
       5.8.2.6. Other Government benefits available to the injured party.
       5.8.2.7. When an offer of settlement from a third party (taking into account most or all of the third
       party's assets and insurance) is considerably less than the injured party's damages.
       5.8.2.8. The liability is questionable.
       5.8.2.9. The injured party received excessive treatment.
       5.8.2.10. The litigation risks are too high.
       5.8.2.11. The Government's claim is almost as large as, or larger, than the assets available for set-
       tlement.
       5.8.2.12. The injured party accepts less than the jury verdict expectancy. Settlement authorities
       can calculate an appropriate amount to compromise the claim after considering how the total set-
       tlement compares to the jury verdict expectancy, as calculated using appropriate jury expectancy
       guides.
       5.8.2.13. When collection would cause an undue hardship on the injured party.
   5.8.3. An injured party or its representative must make a compromise request in writing and clearly
   detail the reasons for the requested compromise.

5.9. Reconsideration. A settlement authority may reconsider its previous disapproval of a waiver or
compromise when the injured party submits new evidence, or the settlement authority learns of errors in
the claim submission or settlement.

5.10. Administration. MAJCOM SJAs with overseas claims responsibilities may modify this chapter's
procedures, if they receive approval in advance from AFLSA/JACC. Direct any questions regarding the
interpretation or application of any section of this chapter to AFLSA/JACC.
   5.10.1. Personnel send files of potential claims against non-Air Force, active-duty military members
   or Federal civilian employees, through AFLSA/JACC, to the military service concerned when they
   involve official duty or scope of employment issues. The other military service determines whether it
   will assert a claim and, if applicable, refers the claim to the single-service claims authority in a foreign
   country.
   5.10.2. Judge advocates and civilian attorneys may participate in litigating HR claims, including fil-
   ing pleadings and representing the United States before workers' compensation boards, administrative
   tribunals, and courts of law. Coordinate with AFLSA/JACC and obtain the approval of the local US
   Attorney before participation.
   5.10.3. Claims personnel open a claim when they have enough facts to assign liability for payment to
   some third party.
90                                                                           AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     5.10.4. Claims personnel set up an internal control log to track potential hospital recovery claims.
     The log includes cases that medical facilities, CHAMPUS, or other sources refer. The log identifies
     patients and notes whether or not appropriate authorities are asserting a claim. If no appropriate
     authorities are asserting the claim, then annotate the log with the reason why. Maintain the log consis-
     tently to help track the disposition of potential claims.

5.11. Notice of Potential Claims. Because a successful hospital recovery program depends on the diffi-
cult task of identifying all potential claims, the base SJA sets up and maintains a network of contacts
throughout the base community to bring potential claims to the attention of the legal office. The SJA peri-
odically publicizes the work that the legal office does in collecting medical care costs.
     5.11.1. Base contacts can provide potential claims from a variety of sources, including:
        5.11.1.1. Medical facility registrars.
        5.11.1.2. Patient affairs representatives
        5.11.1.3. MTF resource management offices.
        5.11.1.4. Other military claims offices.
        5.11.1.5. Medical record requests.
        5.11.1.6. CHAMPUS
        5.11.1.7. The AFO.
     5.11.2. The MTF registrars and patient affairs representatives advise the base SJA of potential
     third-party liability claims arising from injuries resulting from motor vehicle accidents. Make this
     notification on AF Form 1488, Daily Log of Patients Treated for Injuries, or AF Form 438, Medi-
     cal Care Third-Party Liability Notification.
     5.11.3. Resource managers (RM) in Government hospitals can provide copies of paid vouchers for
     military members treated in private facilities. The RM office also submits unresolved coordination of
     benefits claims against health insurance policies. The legal office vigorously pursues any health insur-
     ance claims utilizing 10 U.S.C. 1095.
     5.11.4. Claims personnel send any potential claims information, including CHAMPUS information or
     payments, to the appropriate claims office.
     5.11.5. Often, injured parties, their agents, workers' compensation boards, or insurance carriers
     request medical records from Air Force medical facilities. This request might indicate a potential
     claim. The SJA, therefore, ensures that medical facility personnel provide copies of all such requests
     to the base legal office for review and possible recovery action. The request for records might also
     indicate possible medical malpractice against the United States. AFLSA/JACT oversees medical mal-
     practice actions.
     5.11.6. AFO personnel provide copies of vouchers when the Government pays civilian medical facil-
     ities for care provided overseas.
     5.11.7. Other sources of potential claims include:
        5.11.7.1. Other Federal medical facilities.
        5.11.7.2. Security police desk blotters.
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                  91


       5.11.7.3. Legal assistance.
       5.11.7.4. Reports of survey.
       5.11.7.5. Property damage claims.

5.12. Interdepartmental Actions. If the injured party or sponsor is a member of another military ser-
vice or Federal agency, claims personnel send the information concerning the medical treatment to the
appropriate military service or agency for action. Refer hospital recovery claims to the designated mili-
tary service in those areas of the world the DoD has imposed single-service responsibility. The responsi-
ble department may ask a more conveniently located military service or agency to investigate a claim.

5.13. Investigating the Claim. After identifying a potential claim, claims personnel fully investigate
the facts and circumstances surrounding the claim. Clearly annotate the results of the investigation in the
claims file. If necessary, the SJA may ask a more conveniently located claims office to help investigate
the claim.

5.14. File Documentation. Claims personnel keep a claim file as complete as possible to sufficiently
identify all parties.
   5.14.1. The file includes, as applicable:
       5.14.1.1. The name, address, and occupation of each third party.
       5.14.1.2. Insurance information (to include the policy number and address of the insurance com-
       pany) of all parties.
       5.14.1.3. A statement indicating whether a third party military member was on duty and acting
       within the scope of employment at the time or was grossly negligent or engaged in willful miscon-
       duct.
   5.14.2. In vehicle cases, claims personnel file insurance information, including:
       5.14.2.1. Uninsured motorist status.
       5.14.2.2. Personal injury protection.
       5.14.2.3. Medical payments.
       5.14.2.4. Other major medical insurance coverage available to any person potentially involved.
       5.14.2.5. Any action taken in accordance with a state's financial responsibility laws.
   5.14.3. Claims personnel file all the documentary evidence supporting the Government's claim for
   medical care costs.
       5.14.3.1. This evidence includes:
           5.14.3.1.1. CHAMPUS forms.
           5.14.3.1.2. Aid vouchers.
           5.14.3.1.3. AF Forms 438, or other military service equivalents.
       5.14.3.2. If personnel submit the file to AFLSA/JACC before care is completed, ensure that the
       current billing data is as accurate as possible.
92                                                                             AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


        5.14.3.3. Claims personnel annotate the amount of the Air Force claim so a third party or its
        insurer can easily identify the treatment amounts and locations. Readily identify the appropriate
        OMB rates, the actual dollar cost, or other amount that the United States has paid. Calculate the
        Government's claim by listing the Office of Management and Budget or Secretary of Defense rates
        and adding the actual cost of treatment from non-Federal sources. Exclude subsistence or other
        dependent flat-rate charges, convalescent leave, and hospitalization not directly related to the
        injury.
     5.14.4. Claims personnel file information about the nature and extent of any injury or disease, such
     as:
        5.14.4.1. Whether the injured party has suffered a permanent or temporary disability.
        5.14.4.2. Whether the injured party has sufficiently described the disability, including the extent
        of injury.
        5.14.4.3. The amount of severance pay or pension the injured party has received, or will receive,
        from the United States.
     5.14.5. Claims personnel also file, if applicable:
        5.14.5.1. A copy of relevant medical records.
        5.14.5.2. A brief of the law on the liability of the third party in the state or location of the claimed
        injury.
        5.14.5.3. Copies of all pertinent correspondence.
        5.14.5.4. The name and address of the injured party's attorney.
        5.14.5.5. A copy of any relevant contract or insurance policy.
        5.14.5.6. he status of any lawsuit or contemplated lawsuit.
        5.14.5.7. A copy of any release that the injured party has signed.
        5.14.5.8. The disposition of all related charges and traffic citations.
        5.14.5.9. The police report.
        5.14.5.10. All other relevant evidence in support of the claim.

5.15. Monitoring the Claim. After asserting the claim, claims personnel monitor the claim closely to
ensure that personnel collect payments effectively and aggressively.
Diligently work to ensure settlement or closure of the file.
     5.15.1. If settlement is not possible, the SJA may refer the claim to the US Attorney or the DoJ, as
     appropriate. The SJA coordinates and works closely with all parties, including attorneys and insurers.

5.16. Attorney Representation Agreement. It is often advantageous for the US to have a private attor-
ney represent the Government's medical care recovery interest.
The United States Attorney is not able to handle routine hospital recovery cases. The SJA may request the
injured party's attorney to represent the Air Force interest. Advise that attorney of the conditions of the
requested representation. The injured party's attorney may include the Government's claim in his or her
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                        93


client's pleadings so that the United States need not become a party to the suit. Note: See the Claims
Adjudicator's Handbook for a sample representation letter and agreement.

5.17. Releasing Records:
   5.17.1. Claims personnel may release medical records supporting a United States hospital recovery
   claim (in accordance with AFI 51-301, AFI 37-131 and AFI 37-132) to the injured party or authorized
   agent, the third party, or the US Attorney, if the United States is involved in litigation.
   5.17.2. Claims personnel refer requests for release of medical records that the base SJA cannot honor
   through claims channels to AFLSA/JACC. Transmit the records, if available, and the claim file with
   the request.

5.18. Requesting Witnesses. A base SJA may honor an injured party's request for the presence of a
Government witness, if the base will provide local funds for any travel or temporary duty (TDY) associ-
ated with the request. Otherwise, notify AFLSA/JACC as soon as possible after receiving the request,
then compile and submit information about the witness request to AFLSA/JACC. Consult other guidance
for non-HR related witness requests or contact AFLSA/JACL for further information.
   5.18.1. Treating Physicians. Treating physicians are ordinarily considered fact witnesses. However,
   their testimony may take on some of the aspects of expert testimony, particularly when they are testi-
   fying about prognosis or causation. Generally treating physicians may testify concerning their treat-
   ment of the injured party; they may offer opinions concerning causation and prognosis only in so far
   as those opinions were developed during the course and within the scope of that treatment. Forward
   such requests to AFLSA/JACC for disposition.

5.19. Disposing of Claims:
   5.19.1. When a third party offers to pay in full, the SJA accepts the offer and signs a release if the
   third party requests it. Deposit the payment with the nearest AFO.
   5.19.2. When a third party offers to pay in full by installments, the SJA may accept if payment will
   be complete within a reasonable time. Prepare a confession of judgment (cognovit) note, which
   details the repayment schedule, and have the tortfeasor execute it, if possible. The legal office keeps
   the file until the third party pays the claim in full. Sign a release of claim if the third party requests it.
   5.19.3. When a third party offers a compromise settlement, by payment of one lump sum or install-
   ments, the SJA may accept the payment if it is within the settlement authority. Note: See paragraph
   5.8.2. for valid reasons for compromise. The SJA ensures that the third party makes payment
   within a reasonable time and that the compromise does not release any joint tortfeasor from pay-
   ment.
   5.19.4. When a third party misses an installment payment, the SJA must initiate aggressive collection
   efforts. Continue trying to collect for no more than 90 days.
   Send claims to Coordinate with AFLSA/JACC when the third party fails to provide an acceptable
   response.

5.20. Depositing Collections. Claims personnel use DD Form 1131 to deposit funds that the United
States collects under the hospital recovery program.
94                                                                          AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     5.20.1. Deposit money recovered from a third-party payer under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 1095 into
     the operations and maintenance account of the Air Force, Army, or Navy MTF that provided the med-
     ical care. After 30 November 1993, deposit money recovered under any statute from any payer for
     treatment in an MTF into that MTF's account.
     5.20.2. If 10 U.S.C. 1095 is not the basis for recovery, deposit money recovered directly from tortfea-
     sors, workers' compensation funds, automobile insurers, and other insurance sources (such as home-
     owner's insurance), with the Treasury to the Miscellaneous Receipts Account 57 3210.999. After 30
     November 1993, if the MTF did not provide the treatment, then deposit the money recovered into the
     US Treasury.
     5.20.3. Deposit only money recovered based on MTF treatment into an MTF account. Claims per-
     sonnel may have to distribute funds among several MTFs on a prorated basis. Deposit money recov-
     ered from an automobile insurer for care provided in an MTF before 5 November 1990, or provided in
     a civilian hospital, including CHAMPUS, with the US Treasury. Deposit money recovered from an
     automobile insurer for care provided in an MTF after that date in the MTF's account. If the amount
     recovered is less that the amount demanded, deposit money to the MTF's account first and deposit the
     remainder, if any, with the US Treasury.

                                                 Chapter 6

  CLAIMS UNDER ARTICLE 139, UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE (UCMJ) (10
                                U.S.C. 939)

6.1. Scope. This chapter explains the Air Force procedures for processing Article 139, UCMJ, claims.

6.2. Claims Payable . Appointing commanders may direct collection and pay a claim for property that
Air Force military personnel willfully damage or wrongfully take, if the claim results from riotous, vio-
lent, or disorderly conduct. Article 139 applies to Air National Guard members only when they are per-
forming duty under Title 10 of the United States Code. If a claim is payable under this chapter and also
under another chapter, settlement authorities may pay the claim under this chapter, if AFLSA/JACC
authorizes it.

6.3. Claims Not Payable. Appointing commanders do not pay:
   6.3.1. Claims resulting from simple negligence.
   6.3.2. Claims for personal injury or death.
   6.3.3. Claims resulting from acts or omissions of Air Force military personnel performing legally
   authorized duties.
   6.3.4. Claims of subrogees.
   6.3.5. Claims arising from private indebtedness.
   6.3.6. Claims for reimbursement for bad checks.

6.4. Limiting Provisions. A person who wishes to file an Article 139 claim against an Air Force mem-
ber submits a complaint within 90 days of the date of the incident.
EXCEPTION: The claimant may file after 90 days, if the appointing commander finds good cause for
the delay. A command determination of good cause or absence of good cause is final.
   6.4.1. AFLSA/JACC must approve any assessment of damages in excess of $5,000 against an
   offender for a single incident.
   6.4.2. Appointing commanders may not pay indirect, remote, or consequential damages.

6.5. Filing a Claim. In order to file a claim in accordance with Article 139, the claimant must complain
(orally or in writing) to the commander of the military organization or unit of the alleged offending mem-
ber or members. If claimants are unsure what organization the offender belongs to, they may file a com-
plaint with the commander of the nearest military installation. While claimants do not need to request a
specific amount when they first complain, the claimant or authorized agent must present a claim for a spe-
cific amount in writing before appointing commanders make a settlement.

6.6. Action by Commanding Officer Receiving the Complaint:
   6.6.1. If the commanding officer who receives the complaint has special court-martial convening
   authority (SPCMCA), and if the offender is a member of the command or is unknown, the commander
   appoints a board of officers to investigate the complaint.
96                                                                          AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


     6.6.2. A commanding officer without SPCMCA sends the complaint to the next higher officer in the
     chain of command exercising such court-martial convening authority.
     6.6.3. If the offender is known, but is not a member of the command, the commander sends the com-
     plaint to the offender's immediate commanding officer.
     6.6.4. If the offenders are members of different commands, whose commanding officers each have
     SPCMCA, the commander submits the complaint to the commanding officer nearest the place of the
     incident.
     6.6.5. If the offender is a member of another military service, the commander sends:
        6.6.5.1. The complaint to the offender's unit commander of that other military service.
        6.6.5.2. A copy of the complaint to the legal office serving that unit commander.

6.7. Action by the Board of Officers:
     6.7.1. The board of officers investigates the facts and circumstances surrounding the complaint. The
     board notifies the offender, in writing, of the pending complaint and of these rights:
        6.7.1.1. Article 31, UCMJ, rights including the right to counsel.
        6.7.1.2. To examine evidence presented.
        6.7.1.3. To present evidence in the offender's own behalf.
        6.7.1.4. To receive the commanding officer's written decision.
     6.7.2. The board of officers:
        6.7.2.1. Determines if the claim falls under Article 139, UCMJ.
        6.7.2.2. Identifies the offenders.
        6.7.2.3. Determines liability and damages.
            6.7.2.3.1. If the offender voluntarily makes payment of an amount in full satisfaction and final
            settlement, the claimant may seek no further recovery.
            6.7.2.3.2. If the offender voluntarily makes a partial payment, the board deducts that amount
            in computing the assessment.
            6.7.2.3.3. The board submits a report to the appointing commander, through the SJA, with
            findings based on the evidence. The board may recommend the following:
                6.7.2.3.3.1. Assessing damages against the offender.
                6.7.2.3.3.2. Assessing appropriate damages against individual unit members who were
                present when the damage occurred, but where authorities cannot individually identify the
                offender
                6.7.2.3.3.3. Disapproving the claim.

6.8. Assessing Damages. When the board assesses damages and the offender is a member of the com-
mand, the SJA reviews the report for legal sufficiency and compliance with this chapter. The SJA deter-
AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997                                                                                   97


mines if a preponderance of the evidence supports the findings and if the board's recommendations are
consistent with the findings.
   6.8.1. The SJA returns the record to the board for further investigation or correction, if irregularities
   or discrepancies exist, or sends the report to the appointing commander.
       6.8.1.1. The appointing commander:
           6.8.1.1.1. Determines if the claim falls under Article 139, UCMJ.
           6.8.1.1.2. Sets the amount to be assessed against each offender. This amount does not exceed
           the amount that the board recommends.
           6.8.1.1.3. Directs the accounting and finance officer to withhold the specified amount from
           the pay of each offender and to pay the claimant.
           6.8.1.1.4. Notifies the claimant and the offender of the action taken.
           6.8.1.1.5. Keeps the original and one copy of the approved board report.
NOTE: Neither the claimant nor the offender may appeal the decisions of the appointing commander.
       6.8.1.2. The accounting and finance officer having custody of the offender's pay record pays the
       claim.
   6.8.2. If the alleged offender is not a member of the command, the appointing commander sends the
   report directly to the offender's commanding officer exercising SPCMCA for final action.
   6.8.3. If the alleged offender is a member of a different service, the appointing commander sends the
   report directly to the commander of the member's unit of the service concerned.

6.9. Reconsidering Article 139 Assessments:
   6.9.1. The commanding officer originally ordering the assessment may reconsider and change the
   decision, if the findings later prove to be wrong.
   6.9.2. The successor in command may change or cancel the assessment only on the basis of:
       6.9.2.1. Newly discovered evidence.
       6.9.2.2. Fraud.
       6.9.2.3. Obvious error of law or fact.
   6.9.3. The commanding officer or the successor may take the actions stated above, even after transfer
   of the offender.

6.10. Canceling Indebtedness. Authorities may cancel indebtedness assessed under Article 139,
UCMJ, only in accordance with this chapter. Other statutes authorizing the Secretary of the Air Force to
cancel indebtedness of an enlisted member do not apply to Article 139, UCMJ. Note: See 10 U.S.C.
9837(d), and DoD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual, paragraph 70722.
98                                                                     AFI51-502 1 MARCH 1997


6.11. Effect of Disciplinary Action. An Article 139 claim is separate and distinct from disciplinary
action that authorities take under any other article of the UCMJ.

lading and warehouse receipts, baggage checks, bank books, unusable airline tickets, and art objects or
documents that a claimant made or wrote.
Property, Personal— Any type of tangible property that is not real property.
Property, Real—Land and whatever is erected or growing upon or affixed to land.
Property— An item that an individual or business owns or possesses. Property includes tangible items,
such as clothing, household furnishings, motor vehicles, real property, and currency. The term does not
include intangible property or items having no independent monetary worth, such as stocks, bonds,
checks, checkbooks, credit cards, telephone service, and cable television services.
Proximate Cause—The primary cause of the loss or damage, without which the damage would not have
happened. Proximate cause is a term of legal art. If in doubt, consult an attorney.
Reasonable Value of Medical Care— Either an amount determined by reference to rates that the Office
of Management and Budget or the Secretary of Defense set for the value of necessary medical care in
United States medical facilities or the actual cost of care from sources that the United States reimburses.

all storage contracts within a geographical area. The contracting officer of each RSMO makes
involuntary collections of nontemporary storage loss and damage claims.

Agreement, direct procurement method (DPM) contract, or Government bill of lading. The transportation

Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR). When personnel procure temporary storage under a
Government bill of lading, it becomes "storage-in-transit" (SIT).

the agreement. The Personal Property Traffic Management Regulation (PPTMR), found in DoD
