1.1. Concept. Requests for congressional replies may be received in writing or telephonically from Air
Staff agencies or directly from congressional members. The procedures outlined in this instruction will
ensure a rapid and properly coordinated response to all congressional inquiries.
    1.1.1. HQ 11 WG/IG is the liaison for all congressional inquiries (except FOIA requests received by
    11 CS/SCS) processed through the 11th Wing regardless of how the inquiries were initially received.
    All taskings for congressional replies received by units in the 11th Wing must be immediately for-
    warded to HQ 11 WG/IG.
    1.1.2. HQ 11 WG/IG will suspense the appropriate group or wing staff agency for proposed replies to
    inquiries. Normally the suspense will be 72 hours. If there is a problem meeting the suspense, the
    tasked group/agency will inform HQ 11 WG/IG immediately so an interim reply can be prepared.

   member.

      the subject of the inquiry needs to furnish a Privacy Act release statement. If a Privacy Act release
      is needed, the action group/agency will ask the subject to sign a release authorizing the release of
      information outside of DoD. A copy of the Privacy Act release should be attached to the reply.
      2.1.5.3. If the subject is no longer on active duty and the requested information is subject to the
      Privacy Act, the action group/agency will provide the requested information and state they could
      not obtain a Privacy Act release.

   reply.

      active duty or not, must be coordinated with HQ 11 WG/CCV.
   2.1.8. HQ 11 WG/IG will forward the proposed reply to HQ 11 WG/CC for approval and release. HQ
   11 WG/IG must ensure the proposed reply has met all requirements of AFI 90-401 prior to release.
   2.1.9. After HQ 11 WG/CC’s approval, HQ 11 WG/IG will send the proposed reply to the original
   tasking agency with an information copy to the group/agency which prepared the reply.
