SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This AFI reflects the main title change, eliminating the IL awards (Gerrity Unit, Gerrity Individual, and
the Sharp awards), which will be included in AFI 36-2810. There are title changes within this AFI for
Table 4.3. and Table 4.4. to clarify eligibility rules of Air Reserve Component (ARC) individuals. Table
4.5. was changed to reflect naming of the ARC Logistics Readiness FGO of the Year Award as the Maj
Gen Alice Astafan ARC Logistics Readiness FGO of the Year Award. Military Traffic Management Com-
mand (MTMC) changed their name to Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) (Table
4.6.). Paragraph 4.3.6. was also changed to specify eligibility of IMAs under the ARC category. Unit
awards will be 2 pages except where noted to be 1 page.
