Instruction (AFI) 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, 2 April 2008. This instruction applies to

records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in
accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of

1. RESPONSIBILITIES.
   1.1. Military funeral honors will be provided for all deceased Air Force active duty, retired,
   and veterans in accordance with AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program.
   1.2. The installation commander (CC) oversees the program, enforces AFI 34-242, Mortuary

       1.2.1. Manning goals are annually determined by dividing the assigned number of E-6s
       and below for each (with the exception of those personnel that are prohibited by law, or
       Air Force policy) squadron by 30. Although E-7s and above may join the Honor Guard,
       they will not be mandated by this matrix. The result will be rounded to the nearest whole
       number. (Example: 62 assigned E-6s and below divided by 30 = 2.06; rounded to the
       nearest whole number would be 2.) If unit manning is between 20 and 40, one person is
       tasked. Each unit is required to provide one NCO per every five individuals sent to the
       Honor Guard. This will ensure compliance with AFI 34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program,
       section 8C, page 90, which requires an officer or NCO on every funeral detail.

    Quarters (CQ), bay orderly, functional augmentation and similar base roster-type duties
    while assigned as a member of the Honor Guard.
    1.5. Due to special details, all Honor Guard members may be authorized to receive Basic

    (DoD) 7000.14-R, Volume 7A, Chapter 25, Substance Allowances.
    1.6. All Honor Guard members are entitled to have one ceremonial uniform per week
    cleaned free of charge through local contracted cleaners. Honor Guard management will

       from performing a scheduled detail. Honor Guard duty takes precedence over normal
       military duties, as well as off-duty employment and education. Honor Guard details are
       mandatory military formations and members will be released by supervision to attend, to
       include base and squadron exercises. During periods of increased readiness (including
       Operational Readiness Inspections (ORIs), etc.), the 19 AW/CC will determine if Honor
       Guard performances will adversely affect the wing mission.

       they have the opportunity to change the schedule or make other arrangements to cover the
       detail.
LITTLEROCKAFBI34-501 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                                           5

  NCOIC. Members removed for reasons such as Article 15, Control Roster, Unfavorable
  Information File, etc. will not be reinstated.

     6.1. All Honor Guard members are required to forecast leave and notify Honor Guard
     NCOIC at least 15 days in advance, with the exception of emergencies. Member’s not
     forecasting leave will be considered last for leave. Due to manning, and the frequency of
     details, only two individuals from Honor Guard will be authorized to take leave at any given
     time. While serving active time (90 days) regular leave should not exceed 7 calendar days.
     6.2. All Honor Guard members are required to submit leave to the Honor Guard NCOIC via

     7.2. If a member is removed from the Honor Guard by his/her unit for reasons of military
     necessity such as a PCS, unavoidable deployment/TDY, or medical profile prior to
     completion of the 180 commitment, the member will not be considered eligible for the
     AFAM for Honor Guard service. The unit may, however, consider re-assigning the member
     to the Honor Guard at a later date and the member may once again become eligible for
     consideration of the AFAM.
     7.3. If a member is removed from the Honor Guard by either the Honor Guard NCOIC or the
     members unit for disciplinary reasons, that member will not be considered eligible for the
     AFAM and will not be re-considered for Honor Guard service at a later date.
     7.4. A member may also become ineligible for consideration of the AFAM for reasons
     resulting in administrative/discipline action such as Letter of Counseling, Letter of
     Reprimand, Article 15, placement on a Control Roster, or establishment of an Unfavorable
