2.2.2. T-38 aircrews will use the following procedures for computing takeoff and landing data
(TOLD): (Note: The numbered Air Force [NAF] director of operations (DO) may approve
TOLD software which complies with this paragraph and will notify HQ AETC/A3FV of all
approved TOLD software.)
           2.2.2.1. (Added) Pilots may use flight manual tabulated data to determine TOLD
           and with 12,800/12,600 pounds dual/solo respectively or the actual aircraft gross
           weight.
           2.2.2.2. (Added) Pilots may use the appropriate flight manual performance charts or
           the 19 AF-approved Microsoft ExcelÂ®-based TOLD calculator to determine TOLD
           based on actual aircraft gross weight prior to takeoff as follows:
               2.2.2.2.1. (Added) Before TCTO 1T-38C-546. Add the aircraft empty gross
               weight obtained from the aircraft weight and balance (Form F), plus the weight of
               fuel (for JP-8, 4,006 pounds total fuel, which includes up to 48 pounds of trapped
               fuel), plus the weight of liquid oxygen (LOX) (approximately 26 pounds), plus 43
               pounds per pilot for aircrew equipment, which includes the parachute and
               miscellaneous equipment, plus actual pilot weight (240 pounds maximum per
               pilot), plus additional 13 pounds per optional survival kit if Form F weight was
               obtained with a standard seat kit, plus optional WSSP (110 pounds) and contents
               (up to 140 pounds), external stores (according to the flight manual), minus
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                          3


            start/taxi fuel (approximately 200 pounds).
            2.2.2.2.2. (Added) After TCTO 1T-38C-546. Add the aircraft empty gross
            weight obtained from the aircraft weight and balance (Form F), plus the weight of
            fuel (for JP-8, 4,006 pounds total fuel, which includes up to 48 pounds of trapped
            fuel), plus the weight of liquid oxygen (LOX) (approximately 26 pounds), plus
            aircrew equipment (28 pounds per pilot for the harness and miscellaneous
            equipment), plus actual pilot weight (245 pounds per pilot maximum), plus
            optional WSSP (110 pounds) and contents (up to 140 pounds), external stores
            (according to the flight manual), minus start/taxi fuel (approximately 200
            pounds).
            2.2.2.2.3. (Added) With squadron supervisor approval, pilots may reduce gross
            weight by burning down fuel to a predetermined useable fuel weight. Reduction
            of gross weight by burning fuel must be completed before taking the runway for
            takeoff and will not include a reduction for fuel used after afterburner light during
            takeoff roll.
     2.2.3. Refer to AFI 11-202, Volume 3, General Flight Rules. Student pilots will only use
     flight planning software according to current training syllabus guidance.
        2.3.3.2. Prepare low-level charts according to the AETC Handout, Navigation for
        Pilot Training, which is available from the HQ AETC/A3 Flying Training Special
        Publications                      web                     site                    at
        https://aetcuft.randolph.af.mil/bookstore/home/homePage.aspx. T-38C aircrew
        will annotate time and distance tick-marks on low-level maps. (Note: a username and
        password are required for access to AETC flying training courseware.)
     3.2.6. (Added) Aircrews should use extreme caution when stowing items in the rear
     cockpit. If it is necessary to place items on or near the rear cockpit breaker panels, they
     should not exceed 8 inches in height to prevent interference with the balance weight arm.
     After closing the canopy with items stored near the rear cockpit circuit breaker panels,
     aircrew should visually confirm clearance exists between the balance weight arm and the
     stowed object. When the balance weight arm is fully closed, the bottom of the arm is 10
     inches above the rear cockpit breaker panels.
     3.2.7. (Added) The aircraft commander will ensure at least one operative flashlight is
     available in each occupied cockpit for night sorties.
     3.2.8. (Added) G-suits are required for all sorties except instrument or navigation.
     3.5.1. (For UFT only) Solo student pilots will stop the aircraft at the end of the runway,
     or an approved area, prior to removing or reinstalling their ejection seat and canopy
     safety pins. When not in formation, solo student pilots will make a radio call to the
     controlling agency stating the ejection seat and canopy jettison safety pins are removed
     and stowed prior to being cleared for takeoff.
     3.5.2. As a minimum, use the videotape recorder (VTR) or video-data transfer system
     (VDTS) to record mission tasks (MOA contact and formation work; air-to-air and air-to-
     surface training; low-level flight; pattern work if applicable, etc) as well as any aerial
     events (flyovers; aerial reviews; aerial demonstrations).

    3.7. Takeoff. During engine run up, the crewmember not in control of the aircraft will
    guard and be ready to assume control of the brakes in case of rudder pedal rod end failure.
       3.7.2. AETC pilots will use takeoff performance data for go/no-go decision making as
       follows: (Note: The pilot in command makes the decision to continue or abort a takeoff
       (go/no-go decision) based on available information; for example, the speeds and
       distances determined in preflight planning, environmental factors; runway length and
       condition; barrier capability; required climb gradient; the actual speed when the event
       occurs; and the severity of event. A go/no-go speed is a reference to aid the pilot in
       decision making.)
           3.7.2.1. (Added) Operations With a Remotely Controlled BAK-15:
              3.7.2.1.1. (Added) When decision speed (DS) is less than or equal to refusal
              speed with engine failure (RS-EF), use RS-EF as go/no-go speed. Aborts for other
              than engine failure (e.g., generator lights, fire lights, etc.) initiated between refusal
              speed with both engines operating (RS-BEO) and RS-EF may result in
              overrunning the runway surface or barrier engagement.
              3.7.2.1.2. (Added) When DS is greater than RS-EF:
                  3.7.2.1.2.1. (Added) If DS is less than or equal to takeoff speed (TOS),
                  approval of the OG/CC is required. After receiving approval, takeoffs are
                  allowed as long as the performance data results in a valid DS and SETOS. Use
                  TOS as the go/no-go speed. The squadron supervisor will brief the aircrew
                  and the supervisor of flying (SOF) on the situation and ensure the crew has the
                  most current data. Only a rated pilot or a student pilot under the supervision of
                  an instructor pilot (IP) in the aircraft may perform the takeoff. Note: For some
                  extreme combinations of temperature and pressure altitude, the performance
                  charts will not yield a valid DS or SETOS. This occurs on the DS chart where
                  the curves on the gross weight plot do not extend far enough upwards and on
                  the SETOS chart where the gross weight plot is labeled âSINGLE ENGINE
                  TAKEOFFS NOT POSSIBLE.â Takeoffs in this situation are prohibited.
                  3.7.2.1.2.2. (Added) If DS is greater than TOS, takeoffs are not authorized.
           3.7.2.2. (Added) Operations Without a BAK-15: (Note: This includes operations
           when the remote control equipment is not operating and the BAK-15 is lowered, and
           operations with the MA-1A.)
              3.7.2.2.1. (Added) When DS is less than or equal to RS-BEO, use RS-BEO as
              go/no-go speed. Aborts for other than engine failure (e.g., generator lights, fire
              lights, etc.) initiated above RS-BEO may result in overrunning the runway
              surface.
              3.7.2.2.2. (Added) When DS is greater than RS-BEO and less than or equal to
              RS-EF, OG/CC approval is required. Use RS-EF as the go/no-go speed. Only a
              rated pilot or a student pilot under the supervision of an IP in the aircraft may
              perform the takeoff. Aborts for other than engine failure (e.g., generator lights,
              fire lights, etc.) may result in overrunning the runway surface if initiated above
              RS-BEO.

            3.7.2.2.3. (Added) When DS is greater than RS-EF, takeoffs are not authorized.
         3.7.2.3. (Added) Operations With a Raised, Nonremotely Controlled BAK-
         15: (Note: Manually raising the BAK-15 when the remote control equipment is not
         operating may allow operations to continue in some circumstances.)
            3.7.2.3.1. (Added) When DS is less than or equal to RS-EF, use RS-EF as
            go/no-go speed.
            3.7.2.3.2. (Added) When DS is greater than RS-EF and less than TOS, takeoffs
            are allowed with the Operations Group commander (OG/CC) approval as long as
            the performance data results in a valid DS and SETOS. Use SETOS as the go/no-
            go speed. The squadron supervisor will brief the crew and the SOF on the
            situation and ensure the crew has the most current data. Pilots will delay rotation
            until 155 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS), and ensure the nose tire is off the
            runway no later than 174 KGS/KIAS respectively. Only a rated pilot or a student
            pilot under the supervision of an IP in the aircraft may perform the takeoff.
            3.7.2.3.3. (Added) When DS is greater than or equal to TOS, takeoffs are not
            authorized.
     3.7.6. Single-ship rolling takeoffs are authorized during daylight hours only. Single-ship
     rolling takeoffs can be accomplished as a single aircraft or within a flight, i.e. separate
     aircraft within a flight accomplishing a rolling takeoff behind preceding aircraft in the
     flight. Prior to performing a rolling takeoff, the pilot must consider TOLD with a runway
     length 300 feet less than the available runway.
     3.7.8. (Added) When aircraft operate on runways with a remotely controlled arresting
     system, pilots will remain on the frequency of the agency, either tower or runway
     supervisory unit (RSU) that controls the runway and the arresting system until safely
     airborne. The barrier will be in the lowered position and will be raised only when the
     pilot calls for it. Note: The BAK-15 is the only arresting system suitable for stopping an
     aircraft with a travel pod. The MA-1A is suitable only for a clean aircraft.
     3.7.9. (Added) The minimum runway required for operations is 8,000 feet. The OG/CC
     may waive the minimum runway required to 7,000 feet. The 19 AF/DO must approve all
     operations on runways less than 7,000 feet.
     3.7.10. (Added) Aircraft must have a full fuel load for each mission. (EXCEPTION:
     See paragraph 2.2.2.2.2 (Added) of this publication.) This requirement may be waived by
     the OG/CC.
  3.8. Formation Takeoff. Use at least 50 feet of wingtip clearance for engine runup with a
  solo in any position.
     3.8.1. Single-ship TOLD will be used when calculating formation takeoff data.
     3.10.4. Unless specifically stated in the exercise or maneuver description, perform all
     maneuvers with gear and flaps in the retracted position.
     3.10.7. (Added) The following additional maneuver parameters apply (paragraphs
     3.10.7.1 (Added) through 3.10.7.5.7 (Added)):
6                                         AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2011


       3.10.7.1. (Added) Supersonic flight will be performed in accordance with AFI 13-
       201, Airspace Management, and local supplements thereto.
       3.10.7.2. (Added) Minimum altitudes are as follows:
           3.10.7.2.1. (Added) For stalls or slow flight, 8,000 feet AGL. Maximum altitude
           is flight level (FL) 200; power setting 80 percent minimum.
           3.10.7.2.2. (Added) For unlimited air combat maneuvering (ACBT), 5,000 feet
           AGL. For all other aerobatic maneuvers, 8,000 feet AGL.
       3.10.7.3. (Added) Accomplish practice nose high recoveries or instrument unusual
       attitudes below FL 240 and in visual meteorological conditions (VMC).
       3.10.7.4. (Added) Apply the following operating restrictions above FL 350.
           3.10.7.4.1. (Added) For flight above FL 350, aircrew will use the minimum
           Mach number indicated on the MFD airspeed indicator.
           3.10.7.4.2. (Added) Do not fly formation above FL 350.
           3.10.7.4.3. (Added) Do not fly above FL 390 except in an emergency (for
           example, divert). Exception: Conduct the maximum altitude checks IAW TO 1T-
           38C-6CF-1, Acceptance and Functional Check Flight Procedures Manual.
       3.10.7.5. (Added) Prohibited maneuvers are as follows:
           3.10.7.5.1. (Added) Practice no-flap patterns and landings with more than 2,500
           pounds of fuel.
           3.10.7.5.2. (Added) Practice single-engine circling approaches or overhead
           patterns. Note: For overhead patterns to set up a practice single-engine go around,
           use both throttles until rolling out on final.
           3.10.7.5.3. (Added) Practice no-flap full-stop landings.
           3.10.7.5.4. (Added) Practice minimum roll landings.
           3.10.7.5.5. (Added) Practice inflight engine shutdowns other than FCF flown by
           qualified FCF pilots or during FCF upgrade sorties.
           3.10.7.5.6. (Added) Formation touch-and-go landings.
           3.10.7.5.7. (Added) Closed and low-closed traffic patterns immediately after
           takeoff.
    3.12.1. At a minimum, accomplish a 90-degree turn at 4 Gs and a 180-degree turn at 5
    Gs. UFT and PIT pilots will accomplish a G-awareness exercise when maneuvers in
    excess of 4 Gs are anticipated. The G-awareness exercise requires a discernible horizon
    with sufficient visual cues to perform the exercise. In the event a G-awareness exercise
    cannot be accomplished, flight leads will modify the flight profile as appropriate.
    3.12.2. All pilots have responsibility for deconfliction during a G-awareness exercise.
    Flight leads will brief the potential conflicts and the transition of the âvisualâ during line
    abreast 180-degree G-awareness turns.
    3.13.2. Refer to Attachment 14 (Added) for UFT and PIT.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                          7


     3.15.7. (Added) Maximum flight size is four aircraft unless waived by 19 AF/DO.
     3.15.8. (Added) Over-the-top maneuvers will not be flown in close trail formation.
     3.16.1. Refer to Attachment 14 (Added) for UFT and PIT training rules. Note: Refer to
     AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures, for IFF training rules.
     3.17.3. Unless safety or circumstances dictate otherwise, a chase aircraft will low-
     approach no lower than 300 feet above ground level (AGL).
  3.19. 9 Icing Restrictions. Do not fly in known or reported icing conditions. Do not cruise
  in forecast icing conditions. T-38 aircrews will request complete icing condition forecasts, to
  include trace icing for the entire route of flight when receiving a preflight weather briefing
  via any source. Operations group commanders will ensure local weather procedures provide
  T-38 supervisors and crews with adequate trace icing forecasts.
     3.19.10. (Added) Pilot Weather Categories (PWC). PWCs are designed to reduce the
     exposure of pilots with limited experience to the risks inherent during periods of low
     ceiling and visibility. Table 3.1 (Added) specifies the PWC minimums.
         3.19.10.1. (Added) When calculating total time for the purpose of PWC, do not
         include student, UFT, or âotherâ flight time. Hours in an assigned aircraft may
         include all series or mission types of that aircraft.
         3.19.10.2. (Added) Assignment of PWC 1 status is dependent on the pilotâs
         demonstrated knowledge and performance in flight under PWC 2 operations and in
         aircrew training devices with low-visibility capability. Before assigning PWC 1, a
         PWC 1 pilot must evaluate the pilotâs instrument proficiency in the simulator or
         aircraft.
         3.19.10.3. (Added) Document certification of PWC 1 on the Letter of Xs signed by
         the commander of the flying squadron to which the pilot is assigned or attached.
         3.19.10.4. (Added) PWC 1 minimums apply to all PWC 2 pilots for approaches at
         the home field. If an IP is on board, aircrews may use the IPâs PWC.
         3.19.10.5. (Added) T-38A pilots converting to the T-38C will be assigned PWC 2
         until achieving a minimum of 25 hours in the T-38C and meeting the criteria listed
         above for PWC 1.

            Volume 1             greater.
 Note: Use the approach end runway visual range to determine takeoff and landing minimums.


      3.19.11. (Added) Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). In AETC, the following
      requirements apply to IFRs (paragraphs 4.11.1 (Added) through 4.11.6 (Added)):
           3.19.11.1. (Added) Takeoff minimums are specified in Table 4.1 (Added). Base the
           decision to launch a local sortie on the existing weather and forecast for planned
           landing plus 1 hour. Base the decision to launch nonlocal sorties on the existing
           weather at takeoff time.
           3.19.11.2. (Added) Do not file to a destination unless the ceiling and visibility for
           the estimated time of arrival, plus or minus 1 hour, is at or above the appropriate
           PWC or suitable published minimums, whichever is greater. See Table 4.1 (Added).
           3.19.11.3. (Added) Weather requirements for an alternate airport requiring radar or
           a global positioning system on the only suitable approach are the same as for an
           alternate without a published approach procedure.
           3.19.11.4. (Added) Do not commence a penetration, en route descent, or approach
           unless existing ceiling and visibility meet the requirements of Table 4.1 (Added).
           3.19.11.5. (Added) After commencing a penetration or approach and if weather is
           reported below the required PWC or published minimums (ceiling or visibility), the
           pilot may continue the approach to the PWC or published minimums, whichever is
           higher. The pilot will ensure the aircraft has sufficient fuel to go missed approach and
           land at the alternate airfield with required reserves. The PWC decision height or
           minimum descent altitude will be determined by reference to the touch-down-zone
           elevation (TDZE) or threshold elevation (THRE), whichever is present on the
           instrument approach procedure, for straight-in approaches and field elevation for
           circling approaches. Use field elevation if TDZE or THRE is unavailable. The pilot
           may descend below the decision height or minimum descent altitude if (1) the aircraft
           is in a position to make a normal approach to the runway of intended landing, and (2)
           the pilot can clearly see the approach threshold of the runway, approach lights, or
           other markings identifiable with the approach end of the runway. In all cases, the pilot
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                        9


        will comply with the last clearance received until obtaining a revised clearance.
        CAUTION: The use of PWC minimums on a precision approach may require a pilot
        to execute a missed approach prior to the published decision height. In these
        instances, upon reaching PWC minimums and making the decision not to continue
        the approach, the pilot should start a climb immediately while proceeding to the
        nonprecision missed approach point (MAP). On reaching the nonprecision MAP, the
        pilot should continue with the published missed approach procedure.
        3.19.11.6. (Added) When flying instrument approaches in VMC conditions, pilots
        may fly down to approach minimums if the runway environment is in sight when
        reaching applicable PWC minimums. Pilots must acknowledge reaching PWC
        minimums and state their intentions to their crewmembers if continuing to published
        approach minimums.
     3.20.9. (Added) The following additional low-altitude procedures apply (paragraphs
     3.20.9.1 (Added) through 3.20.9.3 (Added)):
        3.20.9.1. (Added) Conduct low altitude training no earlier than 30 minutes after
        sunrise (1 hour mountainous terrain), and exit the low altitude structure no later than
        30 minutes prior to sunset (1 hour mountainous terrain).
        3.20.9.2. (Added-UFT and PIT only) Single-ship low-altitude training will be dual.
        3.20.9.3. (Added) The maximum airspeed for UFT and PIT low-level operations is
        420 knots. The maximum airspeed for IFF low-level operations is 450 knots.
     3.21.1. Completion of an IP course clears SUPT, ENJJPT, and IFF IPs to fly or instruct
     low-level navigation or formation missions (without offensive air-to-air employment or
     threat reaction) down to 500 feet AGL. See AFI 11-2T-38, Volume 1, AETC
     Supplement, T-38 Aircrew Training, Attachment 5 (Added), for additional IFF training.
     3.21.4. (Added) The minimum altitude for flying visual flight rules (VFR) point-to-
     point navigation missions dictated by operational or training requirements is 3,000 feet
     AGL.
     3.23.7. (Added) The following additional night operations procedures apply (paragraphs
     3.23.7.1 (Added) through 3.23.7.4 (Added)):
        3.23.7.1. (Added) Fly night overhead patterns only at the home base. (Lackland
        AFB is included for the 12th Flying Training Wing.)
        3.23.7.2. (Added) All night landings require operational glidepath guidance
        (precision approach or visual glidepath guidance) as follows:
            3.23.7.2.1. (Added) Unless required by a formal course syllabus or training
            associated with instructing that syllabus, the preferred night approach procedures
            (in descending order) are as follows:
                3.23.7.2.1.1. (Added) Precision approach.
                3.23.7.2.1.2. (Added) Nonprecision approach with an associated visual
                descent path indicator.
                3.23.7.2.1.3. (Added) VFR straight-in.
10                                         AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2011


                 3.23.7.2.1.4. (Added) VFR rectangular pattern.
             3.23.7.2.2. (Added) When available, use a visual descent path indicator to
             monitor glide slope position during visual approaches. Also use the instrument
             landing system (ILS) glide slope if available.
         3.23.7.3. (Added) All descents below a minimum descent altitude on a nonprecision
         approach require an operational visual approach system.
         3.23.7.4. (Added) The instrument straight-in portion of a circling approach is
         allowed. However, the straight-in approach must terminate in either a missed
         approach or a transition to visual approach guidance for landing; for example, visual
         approach slope indicator (VASI) or precision approach path indicator (PAPI).
  3.24. Approaches and Landings. (For UFT only) When airborne and before moving the
  gear handle, the pilot flying the aircraft will make an intercockpit âgear clearâ call and pause
  momentarily before moving the gear handle. Prior to a studentâs initial solo, the IP will
  acknowledge âclearâ before the student moves the gear handle. On all other sorties, âgear
  clearâ is an advisory call only.
     3.26.2. For parallel runway configurations that do not allow for 4,000 to 6,000 feet of
     lateral spacing, local procedures can dictate spacing to a minimum of 2,000â of lateral
     spacing.
  3.33. (Added) Touch-and-Go Landings. The maximum crosswind for single-ship touch-
  and-go landings is 25 knots for a dry runway.
  3.34. (Added) Extended Daylight:
     3.34.1. (Added) Extended daylight is defined as the period 15 minutes prior to official
     sunrise to 15 minutes past official sunset. For local training only, daylight traffic pattern
     and MOA operations are in effect during the extended daylight period.
     3.34.2. (Added) All maneuvers normally accomplished during normal daylight hours
     may be performed within the extended daylight window, including solo syllabus sorties.
     Under certain weather conditions, such as low ceiling and visibility, the SOF will decide
     if maneuvers are appropriate or safe during the times defined in paragraph 3.34.1
     (Added).
  3.35. (Added) Bat Procedures at Randolph AFB. Approval from the home OG/CC is
  required to arrive or depart during periods of increased bat activity as defined in Area
  Planning 1.
  3.36. (Added) Operating in High Wind or Sea States. Units will restrict their flying
  operations when high winds or sea states would be hazardous to aircrew members in ejection
  situations. Local training flights are not permitted over land when steady state surface winds
  (forecast or actual) in training or operating areas exceed 35 knots. In training or operating
  areas, overwater training flights will not be permitted when forecast or actual wave heights
  exceed 10 feet or surface winds exceed 25 knots. This is not intended to restrict operations
  when only a small portion of the route or area is affected. If possible, alter mission plan to
  avoid the area. The OG/CC or equivalent is the waiver authority.
AFI11-2T-38V3_AETCSUP 6 DECEMBER 2011                                                        11


  3.37. (Added) Functional Check Flight (FCF) Restrictions:
     3.37.1. (Added) Pilots will not conduct FCFs in conjunction with other type missions
     except FCF continuation training, FCF upgrade training, or FCF standardization check
     flights. Only an FCF pilot or a pilot in training status with an FCF IP on board will
     accomplish FCFs.
     3.37.2. (Added) FCFs may recover at home station when originating from AETC
     auxiliary fields or from bases within the local flying area.
     3.37.3. (Added) FCF pilots will not practice instrument approaches or other AETC
     syllabus maneuvers not in compliance with technical order (TO) 1T-38C-6CF-1 on FCF
     missions unless required to check the aircraft. FCF pilots will ensure instrument hoods or
     vision-restricting devices are not installed in FCF aircraft.
     3.37.4. (Added) FCF pilots will ensure rear seat publications and seat packs are
     removed before solo FCFs.

     unless required to complete the FCF according to TO 1T-38C-6CF-1.
     3.37.6. (Added) The commander who owns the aircraft may approve AETC FCF pilots
     to perform required FCFs on transient AETC aircraft. All FCFs on AETC aircraft will be
     flown by AETC or 415th Flight Test Flight FCF pilots or crews. AETC FCF pilots or
     crews will not normally perform FCFs on transient aircraft from other services or
     commands without specific approval from the commander having operational control
     over the aircraft.
     4.2.4. (Added) Ground control intercept or air combat maneuvering instrumentation is
     required to employ more than two aircraft during unlimited maneuvering.
     4.2.5. (Added) Only two T-38 aircraft will be in a dissimilar air combat tactics visual
     engagement.
     6.1.1. No aircraft will be accepted for flight with the low oxygen quantity light
     illuminated. (The OG/CC may authorize a one-time flight below 10,000 feet MSL.) If
     oxygen quantity decreases to 1 liter or less when airborne, descend to at or below 10,000
     feet MSL and land as soon as practical.
     6.2.1. Flight leads will notify ATC and the operations supervisor as a minimum.
  6.9. Inflight Practice of Emergency Procedures. Simulated emergency practice requires
  daylight, a ceiling at least 1,500 feet AGL, visibility at least 3 miles, and VMC according to
  AFI 11-202, Volume 3.
     6.9.1. Pilots current or upgrading in the aircraft may practice simulated emergency
     procedures. Pilots will not practice simulated emergency takeoff, approach, or landing
     procedures unless an IP or flight examiner has immediate access to aircraft controls
     except as follows:
         6.9.1.1. (Added) Rated pilots maintaining basic aircraft qualification status flying
         dual may practice simulated emergency takeoff, approach, and landing procedures
         without an IP or flight examiner in the aircraft.

         the 80th Flying Training Wing).
  6.13. Nonpilot Aircrew Flying. IFF weapon system officers may control the aircraft but
  will not have physical control of the aircraft during:
     6.13.1. (Added) Student pilot sorties (in the same aircraft with the student pilot), unless
     safety of flight dictates.
     6.13.2. (Added) Takeoffs or landings.
     6.13.3. (Added) Overhead traffic patterns.
     6.13.4. (Added) Weapons delivery (simulated).

     in approaches may be flown until 1,000 feet AGL.)
  6.14. (Added) T-38 Minimum Equipment (when installed) (Excluding FCFs). In
  AETC, T-38 minimum equipment guidance is as follows (paragraphs 6.14.1 (Added) through
  6.14.5 (Added)): (EXCEPTION: The OG/CC exercising operational control over that aircraft
  may approve a one-time flight to facilitate aircraft repair.)
     6.14.1. (Added) The following equipment must be fully operational for all sorties:
         6.14.1.1. (Added) Tactical air navigation (TACAN) or very high frequency
         omnidirectional range (VOR), and distance measuring equipment (DME).
