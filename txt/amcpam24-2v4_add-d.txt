This pamphlet series is intended as a load planning guide and provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners (both long range and individual
movement) to load plan aircraft in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Equipment and methods
listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed. It must be noted that,
unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not standardized, and can vary widely,
even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval, therefore, ultimately rests with the
individual contractor providing airlift services to the DOD.

This pamphlet series enables application of DTR 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation –
Part III Mobility, Appendix V, Aircraft Load Planning and Documentation; as well as AMCI 10-
402, Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). The guidance contained herein is applicable to all USAF,
AFRC, ANG and DOD agencies whenever they are charged with using the CRAF assets
contained herein, in accordance with DOD, inter-service, and/or MAJCOM agreements.

                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Purpose. This pamphlet series is non-directive in nature. It provides the basic information,
data, and technical specifications needed in order for planners to more efficiently and effectively
load plan aircraft in the CRAF.

1.2. Scope. CRAF aircraft specifications listed herein are current as of the date of this printing.
Equipment and methods listed are compatible with all CRAF aircraft and cargo areas discussed.
It must be noted that, unlike military cargo aircraft, civilian airframes are not
standardized, and can vary widely, even within each carrier’s fleet. Final approval,
therefore, ultimately rests with the individual contractor providing airlift services to the
DOD.
1.2.1. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas). AMCPAM 24-2 Volume 4 deals specifically
with aircraft originally manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corporation. McDonnell Douglas
Corp. first formed in 1967 after the Douglas Co. (founded 1920) and McDonnell Aircraft Corp.
(originating in 1928) merged. Through the last merger into the Boeing Company in 1997, the
Boeing Company has melded the companies founded by aerospace pioneers William Boeing,
Donald Douglas, James McDonnell, James "Dutch" Kindelberger, and Howard Hughes Jr. As of
the date of this publication, the Boeing Company has produced almost 17,000 commercial jet
aircraft alone, with over 12,100 still in service.

1.3. Arrangement. This pamphlet series is designed for easy reference and access to the most
commonly needed information for planning purposes. Essentially, Volume 1 will contain all
information common to the entire CRAF program and most, if not all, carriers. Volumes 2
through 5 will contain information specific to a particular manufacturer’s airframes, with each
sub-volume addendum addressing a different series or type. Each can be referenced separately
from another; however, each addendum needs to be used in conjunction with Volume 1.
1.3.1. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) Addenda. Volume 4 is not separated from each
subsequent addendum, but is published as a “cover” document along with and as an introduction
for each addendum. The same information for Volume 4 essentially gets republished--unchanged
with each Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) model’s addendum.
1.3.2. Volume 4, Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) Quick Reference Tables. All chapter
descriptions for various models are designed to be used in conjunction with Chapter 2 Quick
Reference Tables. The information in the Quick Reference Tables will generally not be restated
in the expanded chapters as they are meant primarily for pictorial figures.

1.4. Supplements. Changes or supplements to this pamphlet by agencies, other than AMC, are
prohibited. This does not preclude its use as a reference document for preparation of intra-
agency instructional directives.

1.5. Acronyms. An explanation of the acronyms used in this pamphlet is in AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 1, Attachment 1.

1.7. Description. Addendum D. Boeing (McDonnell Douglas) MD-80 Series.
The MD-80 Series aircraft are narrow body, single-aisle, twin-engine aircraft, designed for
medium range. Originally designated as part of the DC-9 Series, the first MD-80 models actually
went by the names "DC-9-80 Series" or the "Super 80's" before being redesignated as the MD-
80. The MD-80 was the first aircraft to combine the "M" for McDonnell and the "D" for
Douglas, and renaming it from the DC-9-80 was thought to be for marketing purposes. However,
with a longer fuselage, redesigned wings, more range, more capacity, and engine & avionics
upgrades, it seems to have earned a separate series name. From the initial delivery in 1980 until
December 1999 when the last MD-80 was delivered, 1,191 MD-80's were manufactured.

The first model in the Series, the MD-81, was type-certified as the DC-9-81 in August 1980.
While sharing the same fuselage diameter and fuselage aft-mounted engines as the DC-9, the
MD-81 was at least 15 feet longer. Also, the MD-81 (and all models of the MD-80 Series)
featured a unique, middle lower cargo compartment, in addition to the forward and aft sections.
These two innovations effectively doubled the amount of passengers and cubic feet of cargo the
MD-81 could carry. Overall, 123 MD-81's were produced until the last delivery in 1994.

MD-82. The next model in the Series, the MD-82, received type-certification as the DC-9-82 on
July 1981. The MD-82 had more powerful engines, which enabled an increased maximum
takeoff weight and overall range with the same passenger/cargo capabilities. This was the most
popular model in the MD-80 Series, with 569 being produced and delivered from 1981 to 1997.

The MD-83 was the first model in the Series to come out after the redesignation into MD-80's,
although it was still type-certified as a DC-9-83 in October 1985. The MD-83 featured more
powerful engines and added fuel capacity, making it the highest gross weight and longest ranged
model of the Series. Overall, 248 of the MD-83 models were manufactured, and the MD-83 was
actually the last production model of the Series to be delivered in December 1999.

The MD-87 was the only model in the Series with a different, smaller fuselage length. This
model was type-certified as the DC-9-87 on October 1987. Although able to carry less
passengers/cargo than other MD-80 models, it is able to attain ranges only slightly less than the
MD-83. This is the least produced model; only 73 were manufactured until 1992.

The MD-88 was type-certified (as the MD-88) in December 1987. It is virtually identical in all
aspects to the MD-82 except for its avionics. A total of 142 MD-88 models were produced.

                               QUICK REFERENCE TABLES

2.1. Ranges. Most numbers are shown as a range, due to representing all-passenger to all-freight
versions OR due to different modifications within a series/type. Also, within a series, several
different engines/weight classes may exist.

2.2. Pallets. Unless otherwise noted, pallet information is based on the civilian pallet IATA code
PAG- / P1P- type LD7 which measures 88" × 125".

2.3. Table Legends.
2.3.1. Compartments. Unless otherwise noted, compartments are: M=Main/Upper;
F=Forward/Lower Lobe; A=Aft/Lower Lobe; B=Bulk/Lower Lobe.

2.3.2. “X”. An “X” represents the information does NOT apply for that series/type (ex: an all-
passenger version would have an “X” by Main Compartment Door)

2.3.3. Question Mark “?”. A “?” represents that the information should apply, but no
information exists in the manufacturer’s technical manuals.

2.3.4. Exclamation Point “!”. An “!” represents information that should apply, but has been
derived from a reliable, but non-manufacturer source.

2.4. After-Market Conversions. As a reminder, individual airlines may have converted an
airframe apart from the manufacturer’s original specifications. These tables and the charts in the
following chapters do not account for this.

2.5. Tables. The following tables (Tables 2.1 through 2.6) will vary with each AMCPAM 24-2,
Volume 4 Addendum.
