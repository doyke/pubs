SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It incorporates
revisions to DODD 2000.12 and DODI 2000.16 including the requirement for an AT level II
certified Antiterrorism Officer; the applicability of AT Standards to non-DoD tenants on DoD
property; and updated DoD AT Standards. AF functional roles and responsibilities were added
or updated to align with the A-staff construct; and several FPCON measures have been revised
or updated, to include measures addressing Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) and
Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear CBRN). Attachment 2-- References to DOD O-
2000.12-H, Attachment 4-- AOR-Specific Training, and Attachment 8-- Antiterrorism Resource
Allocation Template were removed and replaced with Attachment 4-- Risk Management and
Resourcing processes. The following Report Control Symbol (RCS) requirements were
removed: HAF-SFC(AR)0126, Training Reports for Antiterrorism Level I and Level II Training,
and HAF-SFC(SA)0125, Status of Antiterrorism Report.

(PACAF) This supplement provides major updates for the PACAF Antiterrorism Program. It
has been substantially revised at all levels. It outlines specific USPACOM requirements and
incorporates PACOM 5050-8 and additional AT policy. It categorizes the HQ PACAF AT
structure into three groups: AT Executive Committee (ATEC), Threat Working Group (TWG),
and the AT Working Group (ATWG) and provides roles and responsibilities for each. It also
provides specific AT guidelines set forth by the Combatant Commander when traveling inside
the PACOM AOR or another Combatant Commander’s AOR. Furthermore it updates guidance
for Unfunded Requests (UFR), Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiative Fund (Cb TRIF) and
Combatant Commander Initiative Fund (CCIF) submissions.

                                           Chapter 1

                       AIR FORCE ANTITERRORISM PROGRAM

1.1. Air Force Antiterrorism Program. This instruction establishes guidance and procedures
for the Air Force (AF) Antiterrorism (AT) Program supporting the Department of Defense
(DOD) AT Program. The program seeks to deter or limit the effects of terrorist acts against the
AF by giving guidance on collecting and disseminating timely threat information, providing
training to all AF members, developing comprehensive plans to deter and counter terrorist
incidents, allocating funds and personnel and implementing AT measures.
   1.1.1. AT Responsibility. AT is a command responsibility and must be thoroughly
   integrated into every unit mission. Commanders must continually review their AT posture to
   keep current with changing policies and threat levels. Risk management is the key when
   determining vulnerabilities and resource prioritization. Any threat or potential vulnerability
   with risk that cannot be controlled to an acceptable level must be forwarded to the next level
   in the chain of command for resolution. AT also requires every individual's participation to
   maintain awareness, practice personal security measures and report suspicious activity.
       1.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) NAF, installation and tenant and unit commanders are
       responsible for implementing DoD, AF, USPACOM and NORTHCOM (Alaska
       installations) AT policy within their organizations.
   1.1.2. Countering the Threat. Countering the terrorist threat requires a fully integrated and
   coordinated AT approach with a number of key areas that include at a minimum: Civil
   Engineers (Readiness and Emergency Management, Facilities Engineering, Explosive
   Ordnance Disposal (EOD) and Fire Emergency Services), chemical, biological, radiological,
   nuclear and high-yield explosives (CBRNE) defense, Services (food), Public Affairs,
   Communications, Intelligence, Operations, Security Forces, Surgeon General, Judge
   Advocate, Comptroller and Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). AT
   programs should be coordinated with overarching efforts to achieve protection, such as Force
   Protection (FP), critical infrastructure protection and continuity of operations, as described in
   Joint Publication (JP) 3-07.2, Antiterrorism.
   1.1.3. DOD Policy. DODD 2000.12, DOD Antiterrorism (AT) Program, establishes the
   DOD policies and responsibilities for the implementation of the DOD AT Program. It
   establishes DODI 2000.16, DOD Antiterrorism (AT) Standards, and DOD O-2000.12-H,
   Antiterrorism Handbook. The DOD AT Program is a sub-element of Combating Terrorism
   (CbT). Combating Terrorism is a pillar of FP.
       1.1.3.1. An active AT program utilizes DOD AT Standards prescribed in DODI 2000.16
       as baseline standards. AF AT Standards in Chapter 2 of this document incorporate and
       supplement the DoD AT Standards and provide AF specific guidance.
          1.1.3.1.1. Geographic Combatant Commander AT policy precedence. In accordance
          with the Unified Command Plan (UCP) and DODD 2000.12, the Geographic
          Combatant Commander (GCC) AT policies take precedence over the AT policies and
          programs of any other DOD Component operating or existing in the GCC area of
          responsibility (AOR) except for those under the security responsibility of a Chief of
 6                                                     AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 28 MAY 2010


            Mission (CoM), to include exercising tactical control (TACON) for FP. TACON for
            FP is in addition to a Combatant Commander’s normal exercise of operation control
            (OPCON) over assigned forces. All DOD personnel traveling into a GCC’s AOR
            shall familiarize themselves and comply with all AOR-specific AT policies. AF
            Components to GCCs bridge gaps between GCC and AF policies. In the application
            of AT policy the more restrictive guidance will be applied.
            1.1.3.1.1. (PACAF) The following AT standards incorporate PACOM 5050-08 and
            additional PACAF AT guidance.
     1.1.4. Non-DOD Tenants on AF Property. Commanders shall ensure that there is a host
     tenant agreement with all non-DOD tenants on AF property and that it specifically obligates
     the non-DOD tenant to comply with the AT requirements in this AFI. Non-DOD tenants on
     an AF installation, facility or other AF property will be incorporated into, comply with and
     support installation security and AT Program requirements. Non-DOD tenants on AF
     property must comply with all aspects of the AT Program addressed in this Instruction and
     other AT guidance documents unless the facility is outside of the installation controlled
     perimeter; DOD personnel occupy less than 25% of the facility’s net interior useable area in
     accordance with Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-01, DOD Minimum Antiterrorism
     Standards for Buildings; and the installation commander determines AT compliance is not
     required for that facility.
     1.1.5. Overseas Travel. All AF military personnel, civilians, dependent family members and
     contractors when supporting DOD operations in accordance with contract provisions and
     outside of the United States shall comply with theater, country and special clearance
     requirements (AFI 24-405, Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide, and DOD
     4500.54-M, DOD Foreign Clearance Manual) before traveling outside the continental
     United States (OCONUS).
     1.1.6. Eagle Eyes. The Eagle Eyes program is an Air Force AT defensive program created
     to enhance the collection of threat information by educating members of the Total Force and
     off-base citizens on the nature of terrorist attack-planning activities. Eagle Eyes is a
     command responsibility and requires every individual's participation to maintain awareness,
     practice personal security measures and report suspicious behavior. Every AF installation
     will establish procedures to receive reports of suspicious behavior or indications of terrorist
     activity.
1.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
     1.2.1. General. AF commanders or civilian equivalent directors assigned AT responsibility
     shall establish active AT programs using DOD AT Standards prescribed in DODI 2000.16 as
     baseline standards to reduce vulnerability to terrorism. AF unique requirements contained in
     this Instruction supplement DOD AT Standards.
        1.2.1.1. Major commands (MAJCOMs), field operating agencies (FOAs), direct
        reporting units (DRUs), AF Components to the GCC, component-numbered AFs (C-
        NAFs), numbered AFs (NAFs), wings, installation and self-supported separate facilities
        and commanders or civilian equivalent directors assigned AT responsibility shall have an
        AT program tailored to the local mission, conditions, terrorist threat and national security
        environment.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 28 MAY 2010                                                        7


        1.2.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) The HQ PACAF AT structure is categorized into three
        groups: AT Executive Committee ATEC), Threat Working Group (TWG), and the
        AT Working Group (ATWG).
           1.2.1.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) The ATEC is chartered to meet semi-annually to
           develop policy and guidance to support installations, geographically separated
           units, and their programs. The ATEC will discuss and coordinate AT matters and
           planning efforts designed to organize, train and equip the force to protect
           personnel, resources and information within the PACAF AOR.
              1.2.1.1.1.1.1. (Added-PACAF) The ATEC is chaired by Vice Commander,
              Pacific Air Forces (HQ PACAF/CV) who will advise COMPACAF on all
              pertinent AT and Integrated Defense (ID) matters. All A-Staff and Special
              Staff functions will have senior level staff representation assigned to the
              ATEC. The ATEC members will rely heavily on the input received from their
              AT representatives assigned to the HQ PACAF ATWG.
              1.2.1.1.1.1.2. (Added-PACAF) 13 AF will provide senior level
              representation at the PACAF ATEC to fulfill their requirements unless they
              establish a separate ATEC within the 13 AF chain of command.
           1.2.1.1.1.2. (Added-PACAF) PACAF Threat Working Group (TWG): The
           TWG is chartered to meet weekly to fuse intelligence, counterintelligence,
           security, and information operations when developing threat assessments and
           AT/FP threat mitigation recommendations for on-going and future operations
           within the PACAF AOR. The TWG recommends airfield security postures for
           Fly-Away Security Team (FAST) requirements for any DoD aircraft transiting the
           PACOM AOR. The TWG maintains an airfield security matrix on the SIPRNET
           to assist in determining FAST requirements. 13 AF/A7S will provide an AT
           representative to the PACAF TWG to ensure 13 AF operations are addressed.
              1.2.1.1.1.2.1. (Added-PACAF) The TWG is chaired by HQ PACAF/A2.
              The chairperson will: Advise COMPACAF on intelligence issues and threats
              effecting installations, resources and personnel within the PACAF AOR.
                1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Provide 13 AF/CC with services for
                intelligence analysis during contingency operations and exercise support.
                1.2.1.1.1.2.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Support TDY missions for both 13 AF

   Procedures Governing the Activities of DOD Intelligence Components that Affect United
   States Persons.
2.3. Standard 3: AT Risk Management.
   2.3.1. The AT risk management process is modeled upon the principles described in DOD
   O-2000.12-H and Integrated Defense Risk Management described in AFPD 31-1. It should
   be applied in all aspects of AT program implementation and planning, including operational
   plans and decisions, development of risk mitigation measures and the prioritization and
   allocation of resources. The essential components of AT risk management include:
   determining the criticality of assets (criticality assessment); assessing the terrorist threats
   (threat assessment); identifying the vulnerabilities of facilities, programs and systems to an
   attack, including the use of CBRNE or similar capabilities (vulnerability assessment);
   assessing risk based on a holistic understanding of the criticality, threat and vulnerability of
   the asset (risk assessment); and implementing the capabilities needed to correct or mitigate
   the risk (countermeasures) and reevaluating risk after countermeasures are employed; and/or
   accepting risk.
      2.3.1.1. The AT risk management process and procedures shall be reviewed at least
      annually. An AT Program Review, a Higher Headquarters Assessment (HHA) or a Joint
      Staff Integrated Vulnerability Assessment (JSIVA) visit satisfies this requirement.
      2.3.1.1. (PACAF) The AT Risk management process will be incorporated into the
      installation antiterrorism plan. Refer to AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, Chapter 3 for
      the Air Force Risk Management process. This should be the guide to determine how the
      commander plans for risk management.
      2.3.1.2. AT risk management is a continuous process of conducting operations. See
      Figure 2.1 for a graphical depiction.
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 28 MAY 2010                                                                              15

                 2.3.1.3. For deployments, AT risk management begins with the warning order.
                 2.3.1.4. (Added-PACAF) . HQ PACAF and installation ATWGs will use an operational
                 risk assessment matrix as a guideline to determine risk mitigation measures for on-going
                 and future operations. Integrated Defense Risk Management Process (IDRMP) is the
                 manual method for conducting a risk assessment. ForcePRO is the automated version of
                 this tool Refer to AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, Chapter 3 for further guidance.
2.4. Standard 4: Terrorism Threat Assessment.
              2.4.1. Through the AFOSI and with support from the A2 and ATO a threat assessment
              process shall be established consistent with the principles outlined in DOD O-2000.12-H to
              identify the full range of known or estimated threat capabilities (including the use or threat of
              use of CBRNE). These assessments shall be updated on an annual basis or more frequently
              as the threat environment dictates or whenever the DIA or GCC TTL changes. Assessments
              shall be tailored to local conditions. For each group that may be a threat the assessment shall
              provide information on the group’s intent, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP),
              capability, probable course of action (COA) and history, as well as any specific targeting
              information that may be available. AFOSI is the AF agency responsible for preparing the
              DOD Threat Assessment (DTA) as prescribed in DODI 5240.18, Counterintelligence
              Analysis and Production.

      defense critical infrastructure and critical assets.
   2.5.2. Criticality assessments will be updated at least annually to determine the degree of
   asset criticality based upon the following factors: relative importance, effect of loss,
   recoverability, mission functionality, substitutability and repairability.             Criticality
   assessments shall provide the basis for identifying those assets that require specific protective
   measures and priorities for resource allocation when developing and updating AT-related
   contingency plans, e.g., AT Plan, Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-
   2, Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP), Integrated Defense Plan (IDP), etc.
2.6. Standard 6: Terrorism Vulnerability Assessment.
   2.6.1. Vulnerability assessment processes shall be established consistent with the principles
   described in DOD O-2000.12-H and AFPD 31-1 to provide a vulnerability-based analysis of
   personnel (mission essential, mass gatherings, etc.) and mission essential assets (energy
   infrastructure, etc.) and information that are susceptible to terrorist threats. Incorporate food
   and water vulnerabilities according to the guidance in AFI 10-246. Incorporate other
   assessments, such assessments made through the DCIP and AF CIP, or coordinate schedules
   so teams visit the installation during the same time frame to reduce the impact on operational
   units.
   2.6.1. (PACAF) As a minimum, local vulnerability assessment (VA) teams will be
   comprised of the installation ATO as the team chief; and functional experts from AFOSI, IN,

     (e.g., air shows, exercises, deployments) off of a US installation must have an approved
     AT Plan in accordance with USPACOM OPORD 5050-08. AT Travel Plans are required
     for all DoD personnel traveling or deploying to countries or areas within the USPACOM
     AOR that are not a part of the US, its territories, or possessions. DoD civilians,
     contractors and family members must abide by USPACOM AT policies and procedures
     when working and/or traveling in an official capacity in the USPACOM AOR. Upon
     (USPACOM) implementation of the Individual Antiterrorism Travel Plan (IATP) in May
     2010, all PACAF personnel will use this mandated computer based way of submitting
     Travel Plans. The IATP must be reviewed by an ATO Coordinator before being
     forwarded to an approving official in the traveler’s chain of command. Other than the
     previously approved military approval levels for the plans civilians are now authorized to
     approve IATP’s. GS-12/13 may sign as an O-3 and above for FPCON BRAVO countries
     and GS-14/15 may sign as an O-5 for FPCON CHARLIE and DELTA countries. The AT
     Plan will be accomplished by the PACAF appointed ATO for the event and submitted to
     the PACAF/ATWG for review prior to approval by the deployed commander. For
     minimum requirements for an Installation AT Plan. See Installation Attachment 6
     (Antiterrorism Plan Template).
     2.7.7.2. (Added-PACAF) When there is no COMAFFOR, deployed commander, etc.,
     and the Wing Commander does not accept the minimum security requirements for the
     event , then the plan will be submitted through the PACAF/TWG to HQ PACAF/A3/5/8
     for approval. Note: For JCS-sponsored exercises and associated planning events, the
     executive agent for the exercise will develop and submit the AT Plan for all participating
     US forces. Templates for consideration are included in PACOM OPORD 5050-08, E-1-1.

2.8. Standard 8: AT Program Coordination.
   2.8.1. GCCs coordinate AT and security matters with the appropriate CoM and host-nation
   authorities for countries within their AOR and with the Heads of the other DOD Components
   whose personnel are stationed in or transit the respective GCC AOR.
   2.8.2. AF Component commanders of personnel who will be stationed in or transit the AOR
   of a GCC shall:
      2.8.2.1. Initiate coordination of AT matters with the appropriate GCC pursuant to the
      requirements established by DODD 2000.12. The senior deployed commander with AT
      responsibility will designate an ATO in writing to coordinate with the AF Component to
      the GCC and provide this information through the Unit Deployment Centers with Unit
      Type Codes (UTCs) assigned for the deployment. AF elements of in-transit forces with
      less than 300 personnel and not deploying as a larger troop movement will comply with
      the GCC operation order (OPORD) and file an in-transit AT plan. File in-transit AT
      plans with their ATO and commander for approval. Coordinate with AF Components to
      GCCs or MAJCOMs to determine in-transit AT plan filing requirements. The plan will
      cover travel from permanent station to the initial assembly or embarkation point, where it
      becomes the responsibility of the senior officer of a larger movement, such as a troop
      commander. If the movement does not join a larger force where AT responsibility is
      transferred, the AT plan must include transit to the deployed location where a commander
      is designated as having AT responsibility by orders. For countries where the AF will be
      performing temporary duty, commanders will immediately contact the AFOSI unit or
      ATO responsible for that AOR. AFOSI will provide a specific, tailored threat briefing
      prior to departure.
      2.8.2.2. To support AT planning and implementation, AT matters are coordinated with
      local, State, Federal and host-nation authorities pursuant to existing law, and AF and
      DOD policy.
   2.8.3. Subordinate elements of the DOD Components on AF installations or self-supported
   separate facilities and AF tenant units on installations or self-supported separate facilities
   shall coordinate AT program and plan requirements with the host installation or self-
   supported separate facility commander or civilian equivalent director. Tenant units shall
   participate fully in installation and self-supported separate facility AT programs. At
   locations where there are multiple DOD components, such as DOD-leased facilities or other
   facilities where DOD occupies space, the designated senior DOD Component, unless
   otherwise stipulated by the applicable GCC, shall be responsible for integrating and
   coordinating individual DOD component security plans into a comprehensive installation,
   self-supported separate facility or area-wide AT program.
      2.8.3.1. (Added-PACAF) . AT Travel Plans are required for all DoD personnel
      traveling or deploying to countries or areas within the USPACOM AOR that are not a
      part of the US, its territories, or possessions. DoD civilians, contractors and family
      members must abide by USPACOM AT policies and procedures when working and/or
      traveling in an official capacity in the USPACOM AOR.
          2.8.3.1.1. (Added-PACAF) Travel restrictions and AT Travel Plans are not required
          for civilians and family members on unofficial travel (e.g., leave) although they are
 24                                                  AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 28 MAY 2010


          highly encouraged to follow these procedures and policies for their own safety and
          security.
          2.8.3.1.2. (Added-PACAF) Personnel deploying outside of the USPACOM AOR
          into another Combatant Commander’s AOR must follow the specific AT guidelines
          set forth by that Combatant Commander.
      2.8.3.2. (Added-PACAF) . Approving authority for AT Travel Plans is as follows:
          2.8.3.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Travel to areas in FPCON BRAVO or lower must be
          approved by the first O-3 in the chain of command. GS-12/13 civilians can also
          approve this plan.
          2.8.3.2.2. (Added-PACAF) Travel to areas in FPCON CHARLIE or higher, the
          approving official is the first O-5 in the chain of command. GS-14/15 civilians can
          also approve this plan.
          2.8.3.2.3. (Added-PACAF) Travel to USPACOM travel restricted areas requires the
          approval of the first O-7 in the chain of command. If applicable, a civilian Senior
          Executive Service (SES) or equivalent exercising authority satisfies the requirement
          for travel restricted areas only. The civilian equivalent authority to sign the AT
          Travel Plans no longer applies to the lower FPCON countries.
             2.8.3.2.3.1. (Added-PACAF) Permission to travel to USPACOM travel
             restricted areas can only be granted by USPACOM/J2 and only for mission
             essential travel. Refer to PACOM/J34 NIPRNET website for the latest listing of

     a full-time position, report directly to the installation Wing or Vice Commander, and
     manage the wing's AT Program. The ATO will have a Top Secret clearance to ensure
     access to all levels of threat reporting. The ATO will not be assigned additional duties or
     programs, e.g., Critical Infrastructure Program (CIP), as these are separate functions.
        2.9.1.9.1. (Added-PACAF) Based upon the unique work load at each installation,
        Wing Commanders should properly staff the wing ATO to execute the wing AT
        program. As a minimum, consider manning the AT Staff with two or three full-time
        (cross-functional) personnel to meet the regulatory AT program requirements.
        Installations should consider completing a manning study to validate additional AT
        Staff for permanent positions. Consider changing the ATO position to a supervisor,
        (GS-12) position as personnel are added to the AT Staff.

  (Intel and/or OSI) will provide all-source threat information and analysis to the installation
  TWG and Intelligence Fusion Cell (IFC), staffs and units within their commands and
  attached tenant units. Intelligence and OSI personnel must coordinate intelligence
  information to ensure a full spectrum threat picture is presented to the installation TWG and
  ATWG. Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRS) can be requested directly from each
  installation A2 office as they come through secure channels into HQ PACAF/A2.
  2.11.5. (Added-PACAF) . The purpose of Blue Dart is to pass time-sensitive threat
  warning information from the information collector to the threatened US unit/person in the
  PACOM AOR. Refer to USPACOM OPORD 5050-08, for specific procedures in
  disseminating Blue Dart threat information. In addition to USPACOM Blue Dart exercises,

   2.11.6. (Added-PACAF) HQ PACAF, NAFs and Installation Commanders will establish
   TWGs. If NAFs elect to participate in the tenant wing’s TWG, they are not required to
   establish a separate TWG. The host installation TWG will remain responsive to NAF’s threat
   information requirements. Installation TWG and ATWG components must communicate on
   a frequent basis so that local commanders and operators are aware of threat intelligence and
   possible mitigation measures in a timely manner. Additionally, installation TWGs must
   forward locally derived threat information and planned FP measures to the PACAF/ATWG
   as soon as possible when changes are planned or executed. PACAF in turn has a
   responsibility to brief senior leadership on these changes and this is completed through the
   TWG process.
      2.11.6.1. (Added-PACAF) Defense Terrorism Warning Reports are handled through
      AIG messages via the PACAF Command Center EA Cell. Any reports pertaining to
      PACAF installations will be assessed by the TWG and recommendations made to the
      ATWG for mitigating measures.
      2.11.6.2. (Added-PACAF) The installation TWG will.
          2.11.6.2.1. (Added-PACAF) Distribute pertinent threat information to the affected
          unit.
          2.11.6.2.2. (Added-PACAF) Analyze information to determine if they can be linked
          to other reports and make any recommendations to the ATWG for potential
          \mitigating measures.
2.12. Standard 12: AT Executive Committee (ATEC).
   2.12.1. An AT executive-level committee or similarly structured corporate body will be
   established at the installation and self-supported separate facility level and higher (stationary
   or deployed) that meets at least semi-annually. ATECs develop and refine AT program
   guidance, policy and standards; act upon recommendations of the ATWG and TWG; and
   determine resource allocation priorities to mitigate or eliminate terrorism-related
   vulnerabilities. The chair and mandatory members of the ATEC will be designated in
   writing. Security clearance requirements for members will be established by the commander.
   An ATWG charter or similar document should be developed to describe member
   responsibilities and minimum functional and SME participation.
   2.12.1. (PACAF) Installations will focus their ATEC meetings towards emerging AT issues
   with the potential to impact operations and/or harm personnel; eliminating and/or mitigating
   vulnerabilities identified in either HHQ Vulnerability Assessments (VA) or during annual
   local VAs.
   2.12.2. AF/A7S chairs the HAF FP Steering Group.
   2.12.2. (PACAF) The ATEC will serve as the final approving authority for all funding
   initiatives implemented to close vulnerabilities. Once the funding initiatives have been
   approved, the completed cost estimate will be built into a funding request and added to the
   installation’s prioritized unfunded AT requirements. These unfunded requirements will be
   forwarded to HQ PACAF/A7S

2.13. Standard 13: AT Physical Security Measure.
   2.13.1. Principles of AFTTP 3-10.1, Integrated Base Defense, AFI 31-101 and DOD
   5200.08-R, Physical Security Program, are applied and fully integrated into AT plans to
   ensure employment of a holistic security system to counter terrorist capabilities. Well-
   designed physical security measures are multi-layered and include the integration and
   synchronization of the following essential elements, as further described in DOD AT
   Standard 13: detection, assessment, delay or denial, communication and response. The
   development of comprehensive physical security measures requires the integration of
   facilities, physical security equipment, trained personnel, biometrics entry control equipment,
   when established, and procedures oriented at a minimum in support of perimeter and area
   security, access and egress control, protection against CBRNE attacks (including those using
   the postal system), HRP protection, barrier plans and facility standoff distances.
   2.13.2. AOR or other mission-specific security policies are developed to guide subordinate
   development of local physical security systems and the purchase of physical security
   equipment.
   2.13.2. (PACAF) Commanders at all levels must continually review their AT posture to
   stay current with changing policies and threat levels. All physical security guidance will be
   adhered to IAW AFI 31-101 PACAFSUP1 and USPACOM OPORD 5050-08. These core
   documents will be used to synchronize physical security and integrated defense into the wing
   AT plan.
   2.13.3. Tenant command and unit security plans and measures are coordinated and
   integrated into the AT Plan.
   2.13.4. Ensure barrier plans include measures to prevent reverse entry though exit lanes.
   Ensure the barrier plan affords personnel time to recognize a possible threat and employ the
   final barrier(s) while minimizing risk to vehicle occupants, e.g. placing a serpentine between
   the integrated defense (ID) check point and the final denial barrier. The purpose of the final
   denial barrier is to prevent an attack but planners must factor that most instances requiring
   barrier employment are because of mistakes in judgment by vehicle operators.
      2.13.4.1. Barrier plans should protect facilities listed in the AT plan from vehicle attacks.
      Installations will ensure proper standoff through UFC and DOD O-2000.12-H
      recommended passive barriers. Barriers plans should also identify owner/users tasked
      with erecting barriers and specified time periods. See JP 3-07.02 for additional guidance
      on establishing barriers plans.
      2.13.4.2. (Added-PACAF) When upgrading existing or installing new base physical
      security measures, use Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-022-01 DoD minimum AT
      standards for buildings.
2.14. Standard 14: Random Antiterrorism Measure.
   2.14.1. The RAM program is developed and implemented as an integral component of the
   overall AT program and guided by the principles outlined in DOD O-2000.12-H. To
   maximize the effectiveness and deterrence value, RAMs should be implemented without a
   set pattern, either in terms of the measure selected, time, place or other variables. Lessons
   learned have highlighted unpredictability in security activities as one of the best and most
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 28 MAY 2010                                                               33


   cost effective deterrents available to a commander. Randomly changing AT TTPs enable
   integrated defenses to appear formidable and prevent threats from easily discerning and
   predicting patterns or routines that are vulnerable to attack. RAMs, at a minimum, shall
   consist of the random implementation of higher FPCON measures, to include MAJCOM or
   locally developed site-specific measures, in consideration of the local terrorist capabilities.
   Random use of other security measures should be used to supplement FPCON measures.
   The RAM program shall be included in AT plans.
   2.14.2. When developing and implementing an effective installation RAM process:
      2.14.2.1. Include tenant units and tenant commands.
      2.14.2.2. Implement daily RAMs to include weekends and holidays. The frequency will
      be increased as the threat increases. At least three RAMs chosen from higher FPCONs
      are required daily.
      2.14.2.3. Use RAMs to mitigate vulnerabilities impacting facilities and nearby areas.
      2.14.2.4. RAM implementation should be compatible and coordinated with ongoing law
      enforcement or CI surveillance detection and ID measures.
      2.14.2.5. Consider methods to make RAMs visible to confuse or expose surveillance
      attempts and preoperational planning.
      2.14.2.6. Implement dynamic and proactive RAMs to communicate unit resolve to
      detect, deter, prepare for and counter threats.
      2.14.2.7. Make efforts to include, as appropriate local, State, Federal and host nation law
      enforcement patrols and first responders.
      2.14.2.8. Implement RAMs installation wide or target specific types of facilities,
      functions or activities.
      2.14.2.9. RAM implementation efforts shall be monitored, tracked and analyzed.
2.15. Standard 15: AT Measures for AF Off-Installation Facilities, Housing and Activities.
   2.15.1. For AF owned or leased off-installation facilities, housing, transportation services,
   daycare centers and other activities used by or involving a mass-gathering of DOD personnel
   and their family members, specific AT measures shall be developed in overall AT programs.
   At locations where there are multiple DOD components or locations, AT measures shall be
   coordinated with the designated senior DOD Component with AT responsibility.
      2.15.1.1. Risk mitigation measures shall include, but are not limited to: emergency
      notification and recall procedures, guidance for selection of off-installation housing,
      temporary billeting and other facility use (including compliance with UFC 4-010-01 for
      leased, newly constructed and expeditionary buildings), physical security measures,
      CBRNE defensive measures and shelter-in-place, relocation and evacuation procedures.
   2.15.2. Mutual Aid Agreements or other similarly structured protocols are developed with
   the appropriate local, State, Federal and host-nation authorities to coordinate security
   measures and assistance requirements.

   010-01, DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings. Refer to AFPD 31-1, AFI
   31-101, AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, and AFH 32-1084, Facility
   Requirements, for additional information. Proper facility project planning, programming and
   design must be done in concert with the ATO, installation intelligence and security personnel
   to adequately address site specific threats. Ensure restoration and modernization projects
   which include security and AT Standards compliance upgrades do not exceed 70 percent cost
   versus new facility standard.
      2.17.1.1. The installation commander or the senior Civil Engineer on the commander’s
      behalf will certify that new facility or renovation projects of 50 percent or more of
      replacement cost comply with standards as listed in paragraph 2.17.1. The ATO will
      work with the engineering staff from design inception to project completion, ensuring
      requirements are met. The ATO should be part of the coordination prior to certification.
      The senior Civil Engineer will report discrepancies to the appropriate MAJCOM for
      determination/action.
   2.17.2. Ensure the A7 (CE) and ATO develop a prioritized list of risk mitigation measures
   (reference DOD O-2000.12-H, UFCs and AFI 31-101) for use by site selection teams. These
   criteria shall be used to determine if facilities either currently occupied or being considered
   for occupancy provide adequate protection for DOD personnel against the effects of a
   terrorist attack. Circumstances may require the movement of DOD personnel or assets to
   facilities the U.S. Government had not previously used or surveyed. AT Standards shall be a
   key consideration in evaluating the suitability of facilities that were previously not used or
   surveyed.
   2.17.3. The A7 (CE) will ensure at least one engineer at each installation has completed the
   Security Engineering and Design Course to review, document and track construction projects

38                                                  AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 28 MAY 2010


  the AT Plan. These measures shall focus on mitigating vulnerabilities of personnel, families,
  facilities and materiel to terrorist use of WMD and CBRNE weapons, as well as overall
  disaster planning and preparedness to respond to a terrorist attack. These measures shall
  include integration with DOD emergency responder guidelines provided in AFI 10-2501;
  mass notification system standards under UFC 4-021-01; establishment of medical
  surveillance systems consistent with DODD 6490.02E, Comprehensive Health Surveillance,
  and AFI 10-2604, Disease Containment Planning Guidance; deployment of CBRNE sensors
  and detectors; providing collective protection; and providing personal protective equipment
  (PPE) or individual protective equipment (IPE) in the following priority and in accordance
  with AFI 10-2501. The contract Statement of Work or Performance Work Statement must
  specify if PPE will be government or contractor provided:
     2.21.1.1. First Responders and Emergency Responders. Personnel who work closest to
     known or suspected CBRNE hazards (e.g., emergency responders) should be provided
     protection needed to perform their duties in an unknown hazard environment.
     Responders should use the maximum possible protection until determined otherwise by
     competent authority.
     2.21.1.2. Critical Personnel. Personnel deemed essential to the performance of critical
     military missions (whether military, civilian, contractor, host-nation personnel or third
     country nationals), such as critical personnel assigned to mission essential functions
     (MEFs) described in AFI 10-208, Continuity of Operations Program (COOP), should be
     provided an appropriate level of protection to support continuity of those critical military
     missions. Since critical missions should be continued without interruption, collective or
     individual protection may be necessary to sustain them.
     2.21.1.3. Essential Personnel. Personnel deemed essential to the performance of
     essential military operations (whether military, civilian, contractor, host-nation personnel
     or third country nationals) should be provided an appropriate level of protection to
     support near continuity for those essential military operations. Since essential operations
     may be interrupted for relatively short periods (e.g., hours to days), escape protection
     may be necessary to sustain essential operations (i.e., escape, survive and restore essential
     operations).
     2.21.1.4. Other Personnel. For all other persons not in the above categories, the
     objective will be to provide the procedures or protection necessary to safely survive an
     incident, e.g. shelter-in-place or evacuation procedures may fulfill this requirement.
     2.21.1.5. Included as part of the above categories are those who work or live on DOD
     installations worldwide, family members authorized overseas and DOD contractors if
     designated in contract agreements and designated as essential to perform critical DOD
     missions.
  2.21.2. Site-specific CBRNE preparedness and emergency response measures are developed
  and coordinated through the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight. These measures
  are implemented and synchronized with a corresponding FPCON measure.
  2.21.3. Mutual Aid Agreements or other similarly constructed protocols will be established
  with the appropriate local, State, Federal or host-nation authorities to support AT Plan
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 28 MAY 2010                                                            39


   execution and augment incident response and post-incident consequence management
   activities.
   2.21.4. The installation should be able to warn its resident population in affected areas of
   possible or confirmed CBRNE hazards immediately, utilizing the Air Force Installation
   Notification and Warning System (INWS). The warning must include instructions to shelter
   in place or evacuate.
   2.21.5. Installation public health emergency response measures that are synchronized with
   FPCON levels shall be developed and implemented.
   2.21.6. (Added-PACAF) Commanders shall include terrorist consequence management
   preparedness and response measures in the installation AT plan focused on the design base
   threat (DBT). General security situations that should be included in the AT Plan include
   hostage taking, Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Device (VBIED) attacks, active shooter
   on base or at on-base schools, hi-jacking, etc. are all examples that need to be addressed.
   Specific Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) response procedures will be included in the
   installation Combined Emergency Response Plan (CEMP).
2.22. Standard 22: Force Protection Condition (FPCON) Measures.
   2.22.1. The GCC is responsible for establishing the baseline FPCON for their AOR and
   procedures to ensure that FPCON measures are uniformly disseminated and implemented.
   The AF Component to the GCC is typically delegated to manage this task for the GCC. See
   Attachment 2 for detailed listing of FPCON measures.
   2.22.1. (PACAF) USPACOM sets the baseline FPCON for the PACOM AOR with the
   exception of Alaska where USNORTHCOM has baseline declaration authority. The
   commanders of USFJ, USFK, NAFs, and installation commanders can adjust FPCONs for
   their geographic areas and personnel/assets however it must not be less than the established
   USPACOM's FPCON baseline.
   2.22.2. Installation commanders with AT responsibility and higher shall:
      2.22.2.1. Determine an appropriate FPCON level for those personnel and assets for
      which they have AT responsibility. Subordinate commanders may raise a higher-level
      commander’s FPCON level, but they shall not lower the FPCON level without the
      higher-level commander’s written concurrence.
      2.22.2.2. Classify site-specific AT measures and physical security actions, linked to an
      FPCON as ―CONFIDENTIAL‖. When separated from the AT Plan, specific AT
      measures linked to a FPCON and site-specific FPCON levels may be downgraded to
      ―FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY,‖ in accordance with DOD 5200.1-R, Information
      Security Program.
   2.22.3. A review mechanism is established to ensure FPCON levels are commensurate with
   changing threats and the principles of risk management. This is essential because
   implementation of FPCON measures at elevated FPCON levels for an extended duration can
   be counterproductive to effective security and overall mission accomplishment. In some
   circumstances, based upon local conditions and the threat environment, commanders should
   consider implementing a lower-level FPCON and supplement with other local security
 40                                                   AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 28 MAY 2010


   measures and RAMs as an effective alternative to executing the higher-level FPCON
   measures.
   2.22.4. Site-specific FPCON measures are developed and implemented for stationary and in-
   transit forces to supplement the FPCON measures and actions enumerated for each FPCON
   level. The development of site-specific FPCON measures must permit sufficient time and
   space to determine hostile intent, while fully considering constraints imposed by standing
   rules of engagement in CJCSI 3121.01B, Standing Rules of Engagement/Standing Rules For
   the Use of Force For U.S. Forces, and rules of force under AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of
   Force by Air Force Personnel. Organic intelligence, CI and law enforcement resources,
   institutional knowledge of the area and comprehensive understanding of organic capabilities,
   supported by national and AOR assets, shall be leveraged in directing tailored FPCON
   measures to be implemented at specific sites for both stationary and in-transit forces.
      2.22.4.1. (Added-PACAF) . All installation ATOs shall report FPCON and/or
      additional measure changes to HQ PACAF/A7SO immediately upon implementation.
      Included in the report should be the change, the intelligence driving the change, and the
      level at which the change was dictated.
      2.22.4.2. (Added-PACAF) Commanders at all levels (e.g., installation, tenant,
      squadron, GSU, etc.), shall establish local measures to supplement those listed in DODI
      2000.16, AFI 10-245 and USPACOM OPORD 5050-08. Any additional local measures
      will be forwarded to the PACAF/ATWG for review through the PCC.
      2.22.4.3. (Added-PACAF) . PACAF communications and information commanders,
      postmasters and installation official mail managers will comply with FPCON measures
      outlined in HQ PACAF Air Postal Squadron (AIRPS) Operating Instruction 10-1,
      PACAF Postal Antiterrorism Program, available at the HQ PACAF/AIRPS home page on
      the Air Force Portal at https://www.hqpacaf.af.mil/airps/, or by contacting PACAF

2.23. Standard 23: AT Training and Exercises.
   2.23.1. AT training and exercises shall integrate with physical security and relevant elements
   of AT, EM, FHP and ID and are afforded the same emphasis as combat task training and
   executed with the intent to identify shortfalls affecting the protection of personnel, assets and
   information against terrorist attack and subsequent AT consequence management efforts.
   2.23.1. (PACAF) All units/organizations should consult their installation TWG in the initial
   exercise or deployment planning stages for threat assessments/information and possible
   mitigation measures. PACAF/TWG will coordinate on all pre-deployment assessments prior
   to exercises involving USAF assets or deployments.
   2.23.2. AT and AOR specific training, particularly pre-deployment training, is supported by
   measurable standards, including credible deterrence and response standards, deterrence-

Terms
Active Defense—The employment of limited offensive action and counterattacks to deny a
contested area or position to the enemy.
Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program—The single, integrated Air Force
program to coordinate and organize efforts to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from and
mitigate the direct and indirect consequences of an emergency or attack. The primary missions
of the Air Force EM program are to (1) save lives, (2) minimize the loss or degradation of
resources and (3) continue, sustain and restore combat and combat support operational capability
in an all-hazards physical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide. The ancillary
missions of the Air Force EM program are to support homeland defense and civil support
operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities IAW DOD directives and
through the appropriate Combatant Command. The Air Force EM program is managed by the
Office of The Civil Engineer, AF/A7C.
Antiterrorism (AT)—Defensive measures used to reduce the vulnerability of individuals and
property to terrorist acts, to include limited response and containment by local military and
civilian forces.
Assessment—Analysis of the security, effectiveness and potential of an existing or planned
intelligence activity. (JP 1-02) [The evaluation of progress toward the creation of effects and the
achievement of objectives and end state conditions.][AFDD 2-1.9]{Words in brackets apply only
to the Air Force and are offered for clarity.}
AT Awareness—Fundamental knowledge of both the terrorist threat and the measures to reduce
personal vulnerability to terrorism.
AT Officer (ATO)—The principal military or civilian advisor charged with managing the AT
program for the commander or DOD civilian exercising equivalent authority.
AT Planning—The process of developing specific guidance and execution-oriented instructions
for subordinates. An AT plan contains command-specific guidance for the establishment of an
AT program and the implementation of the AT Standards.
AT Program—One of several security-related programs that fall under the overarching
combating terrorism and FP programs. The AT program is a collective, proactive effort focused
on the prevention and detection of terrorist attacks against DOD personnel and their families,
facilities, installations and infrastructure critical to mission accomplishment as well as the
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 28 MAY 2010                                                               57


preparation to defend against and planning for the response to the consequences of terrorist
incidents. Although not elements of AT, plans for terrorism consequence management
preparedness and response measures as well as plans for continuing essential military operations
are important adjuncts to an effective AT program. The minimum elements of an AT program
are AT risk management, planning, training and exercises, resource application and a program
review.
AT Program Review—The process of developing specific guidelines used to evaluate the AT
Program in order to assess satisfactorily and evaluate the effectiveness and adequacy of the AT
Program.
AT Resource Application—The process of applying risk management to vulnerabilities and
where the resultant risk is not acceptable after applying mitigation measures, elevate the
vulnerability with a resource request using the existing PPB&E system, the CbT-RIF, the
Physical Security Program and other funding mechanisms. Central to success in resource
application is tracking and ensuring sufficient funding for identified AT program life-cycle costs
and assessed shortfalls to mitigate risk associated with terrorist capabilities.
AT Risk Management—The process of systematically identifying, assessing and controlling
risks arising from operational factors and making decisions that balance possible adverse
outcomes with mission benefits. The end products of the AT program risk management process
shall be the identification of DOD elements and personnel that are vulnerable to the identified
threat attack means. From the assessment of risk based upon the three critical components of AT
risk management (threat assessment, criticality assessment and vulnerability assessment), the
commander must determine which DOD elements and personnel are at greatest risk and how best
to employ given resources and FP measures to deter, mitigate or prepare for a terrorist incident.
AT Training and Exercises—The process of developing individual, leader and collective skills
and of conducting comprehensive exercises to validate plans for AT incident response,
consequence management and continuity of essential military operations.
Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT)—Biological agents and toxins that present a high
bioterrorism risk to national security and have the greatest potential for adverse public health
impact with mass casualties of humans and/or animals or that pose a severe threat to plant health
or to plant products. The lists are reviewed and updated by HHS/CDC and USDA/APHIS.
Agents and toxins that are excluded in Title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 73, and Title
7, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 331 are excluded as BSAT.
Combating Terrorism (CbT)—For the purposes of this Instruction, combating terrorism within
the DOD encompasses all actions, including AT, counterterrorism, terrorism consequence
management (preparation for and response to the consequences of a terrorist incident or event)
and terrorism intelligence support (collection and dissemination of terrorism-related
information), taken to oppose terrorism throughout the entire threat spectrum, including terrorist
use of CBRNE.
Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiatives Fund (CbT-RIF)—Program established by
Congress in the FY 1997 National Defense Authorization Act and managed by the J-3
DDAT/HD. Provides funds for emergency and emergent high-priority antiterrorism projects or
equipment submitted by combatant commands and approved by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

authority rests with the States to respond. The Federal Government responds through the
Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency, as the Lead
Federal Agency (LFA) for providing assistance as required. DOS is the LFA for foreign
consequence management.
Coordination—The necessary action to ensure adequate exchange of information to integrate,
synchronize and deconflict operations between separate organizations. Coordination is not
necessarily a process of gaining approval but is most often used for mutual exchange of
information. Normally used between functions of a supporting staff. Direct liaison authorized
(DIRLAUTH) is used to coordinate with an organization outside of the immediate staff or
organization.
Counterintelligence (CI)—Information gathered and activities conducted to protect against
espionage, other intelligence activities, sabotage or assassinations conducted by or on behalf of

              FORCE PROTECTION CONDITION (FPCON) MEASURES

A2.1. General. The DOD FPCON System describes the progressive level of protective
measures that are implemented by all the DOD Components in anticipation of or in response to a
terrorist threat or attack. The FPCON System is the principal means through which commanders
apply an operational decision on how to best guard against the terrorist threat. The protective
measures identified in the FPCON System assist commanders in reducing the risks of terrorist
attacks and other security threats to DOD personnel, units and activities. The measures below
are derived from DOD AT Standard 22 and include AF modifications. Commanders will ensure
these measures and developed measures address local and operational risks. Commanders must
consider GCC policies, local laws, mutual support agreements and/or the SOFA. Air Force
commanders are responsible for implementing FPCON measures.
   A2.1.1. Commanders shall ensure the following when implementing FPCON measures:
       A2.1.1.1. Ensure there is an effective AT plan and the plan is widely known and
       practiced in order to use ―every airman as a sensor‖.
       A2.1.1.2. Analyze the threat and plan courses of action to defeat those threats. Detailed
       planning against plausible enemy courses of action will often point to vulnerabilities
       which can be mitigated through adjustments to TTPs and further mitigated through
       innovation and programming.
       A2.1.1.3. Consider force on force or intruder play to test COAs. Development and
       implementation of effective friendly COAs to counter known threats offers a reasonable
       deterrent effect and the opportunity for long-term success against terrorist attack.
       A2.1.1.4. Ensure personnel assigned tasks directed by FPCON measures are properly
       trained and available to carry out the task.
       A2.1.1.5. Based on the threat, employ sufficient patrols to deter enemy action, disrupt
       terrorist planning and respond to incidents or attacks against the installation. Patrols
       should focus protection on critical operational assets, mission support infrastructure and
       mass gathering locations.
       A2.1.1.6. Consider placing barriers around identified critical assets, facilities with
       BSAT, restricted areas, high occupancy facilities, flight line entry points and high value
       resource areas to create standoff.
       A2.1.1.7. Review and be familiar with mutual aid and host tenant support agreements.
       Keep law enforcement agencies (federal, state and local) appraised of the current
       situation and threat to determine the level of incident support the installation provides or
       receives.
       A2.1.1.8. Ensure the installation Disaster Response Force and its sub elements are
       trained and available for response as described in AFI 10-2501.
   A2.1.2. The DOD FPCON System consists of five progressive levels of increasing AT
   protective measures.
 66                                                 AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 28 MAY 2010


   A2.1.3. Site-specific AT measures and physical security actions, linked to an FPCON, shall
   be classified ―CONFIDENTIAL.‖ When separated from the AT Plan, specific AT measures
   linked to a FPCON and site-specific FPCON levels may be downgraded to ―FOR OFFICIAL
   USE ONLY,‖ if appropriate.
   A2.1.4. Upon declaration of an FPCON level, all listed security measures for that FPCON
   level shall be implemented immediately unless waived in writing by the appropriate GCC or
   delegated representative. In non-DOD controlled facilities housing DOD occupants, DOD
   organizations shall implement applicable FPCON measures in space directly controlled by
   DOD to the extent possible. The supplementing RAMs and command-unique or site-specific
   measures should also be implemented to complicate a terrorist group’s operational planning
   and targeting.
   A2.1.5. AF installations and separate facilities shall supplement each FPCON measure in
   this instruction with site-specific details describing how the measure is to be implemented
   locally, to include responsibilities assigned to subordinate units and organizations.
   A2.1.6. Airfield-specific measures are for installations and facilities with a permanently
   functioning airfield. Installations and facilities with an emergency helicopter pad should
   review and implement any applicable airfield-specific measures when they anticipate air
   operations.
   A2.1.7. The CBRN related FPCON measures contained in this publication are not all
   inclusive. Additional CBRN FPCON measures are in the AF Civil Engineer Support Agency
   (AFCESA) Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2 template. Each
   MAJCOM and installation should also develop additional CBRN FPCON measures
   applicable to their location.
A2.2. FPCON NORMAL. This condition applies when a general global threat of possible
terrorist activity exists and warrants a routine security posture. At a minimum, access control
will be conducted at all DOD installations and facilities.
   A2.2.1. Measure NORMAL 1: Secure and randomly inspect buildings, rooms and storage
   areas not in regular use.
   A2.2.2. Measure NORMAL 2 (AF Modified): Conduct random security checks of vehicles
   and persons entering facilities under the jurisdiction of the United States.
       A2.2.2.1. Measure NORMAL 2.1 (AF Added): Conduct random vehicle inspections at
       installation entry points in addition to base entry point checks (BEPC) as directed by
       installation commanders. Implement 100% inspection of large commercial vehicles.
       MAJCOM and local planners should define large commercial vehicles in integrated
       defense plans based on geographical location, character of local transport and threat.
       Conduct random vehicle inspections at entrances to restricted areas beyond inspection
       requirements listed in AFI 31-101.
   A2.2.3. Measure NORMAL 3: Limit access points for vehicles and personnel commensurate
   with a reasonable flow of traffic.

   sufficient number and types of barriers remain for increased FPCON/RAMs.
   A2.2.8. Measure NORMAL 8 (AF Added): Identify local vendors that are able to provide
   rapid stocks of emergency response equipment and supplies in accordance with local
   response plans.
A2.3. FPCON ALPHA. (AF Modified) This condition applies when there is an increased
general threat of possible terrorist activity against personnel or facilities, the nature and extent of
which are unpredictable, and circumstances do not justify full implementation of FPCON
BRAVO measures. However, it may be necessary to implement certain measures from higher
FPCONs measures resulting from intelligence received or as a deterrent. The measures in this
FPCON must be capable of being maintained indefinitely.
   A2.3.1. Measure ALPHA 1: Fully implement all measures of lower FPCON levels.
   A2.3.2. Measure ALPHA 2: At regular intervals, inform personnel and family members of
   the general situation. Ensure personnel arriving for duty are briefed on the threat. Also,
   remind them to be alert for and to report suspicious activities, such as the presence of
   unfamiliar personnel and vehicles, suspicious parcels and possible surveillance attempts.
       A2.3.2.1. Measure ALPHA 2.1 (AF Added): Post signs at installation gates and utilize
       mass communication systems to inform/remind personnel of the FPCON level.
   A2.3.3. Measure ALPHA 3: The duty officer or personnel with access to building plans as

   available detectors (deployment and home station assets).
   A2.3.14. Measure ALPHA 14: Review all higher FPCON measures.
A2.4. FPCON BRAVO. Applies when an increased or more predictable threat of terrorist
activity exists. Sustaining BRAVO measures for a prolonged period may affect operational
capability and military-civil relationships with local authorities.
   A2.4.1. Measure BRAVO 1: Fully implement all measures of lower FPCON levels.
      A2.4.1.1. Measure BRAVO 1.1 (AF Added): Brief personnel on the updated threat and
      associated procedures. Update signs at installation gates and utilize mass communication
      systems to inform/remind personnel of the FPCON level.
      A2.4.1.2. Measure BRAVO 1.2 (AF Added): Increase frequency of daily RAMs. Focus
      additional RAMs on current situation and nature of threat.
      A2.4.1.3. Measure BRAVO 1.3 (AF Added): Have intelligence and OSI provide a
      CBRN threat briefing to the Threat Working Group (TWG) or equivalent. Include
      specific information such as probability of CBRN use, type(s) and amount of CBRN

  profile locations. Randomly search vehicles entering these areas. Particular scrutiny should
  be given to vehicles that are capable of concealing a large improvised explosive device
  (IED), e.g., cargo vans or delivery vehicles, sufficient to cause catastrophic damage to
  property or loss of life.
  A2.4.3. Measure BRAVO 3 (AF Modified): Keep cars and objects (e.g., crates, trash
  containers) away from buildings to reduce vulnerability to bomb attacks. Apply this criterion
  to all critical and high-occupancy buildings. Consider applying to all inhabited structures to
  the greatest extent possible. Standoff distance should be determined by the following factors:
  asset criticality, the protection level provided by structure, IED or Vehicle Borne IED
  (VBIED) threat and available security measures. Consider centralized parking and
  implementation of barrier plans. Utilize UFC 4-010-01, DOD Minimum Antiterrorism
  Standards for Buildings, and UFC 4-010-02, DOD Minimum Antiterrorism Standoff
  Distances for Buildings. The AFH 10-2401, Vehicle Bomb Mitigation Guide, is an additional
  tool for standoff planning.
  A2.4.4. Measure BRAVO 4: Secure and periodically inspect all buildings, rooms and
  storage areas not in regular use.

   A2.5.8. Measure CHARLIE 8 (AF Modified): Increase patrolling of the installation/facility
   to include waterside perimeters, if appropriate. Be prepared to assist local authorities in
   searching for threatening actions/persons outside the facility perimeter. For airfields, patrol
   or provide observation of aircraft parking areas and approach and departure flight corridors
   as appropriate to the threat (coordinate with Transportation Security Administration, Marine
   Patrol, United States Coast Guard and local law enforcement as required to cover off-facility
   approach and departure flight corridors).

                              TERRORIST THREAT LEVELS

A3.1. General. The standardized DOD methodology that describes the terrorist threat to DOD
personnel, facilities and interests shall be used to determine Terrorism Threat Levels (TTL). The
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) sets the DOD TTL for all countries. Terrorism threat levels
are established as the result of all-source analysis and incorporation of GCC and Military
Department input. The JITF-CT coordinates country TTLs with appropriate GCCs, Services and
Defense Attaches.
   A3.1.1. DIA and the responsible GCC may assign different threat levels to the same country.
   This is possible because analysts occasionally disagree about the conclusions to be drawn
   from available information. Threat assessments provide information to assist commanders in
   determining the appropriate FPCON level and measures. FPCON level declarations remain
   the exclusive responsibility of commanders. Threat levels are not tied to FPCON levels in
   any way and should not be confused. National-level DOD organizations cannot provide all
   intelligence that might be needed to make FPCON level determinations. Information from
   regional and tactical intelligence and local law enforcement authorities must also be
   considered.
   A3.1.2. Threat assessments are not to be confused with DOD-designated high physical threat
   countries. DOD-designated high physical threat countries pertain exclusively to the DOD
   Travel Security Policy.
A3.2. Terrorist Threat Levels. In assessing the terrorist threat to U.S. personnel and interests,
DOD intelligence agencies use a four-step scale to describe the severity of the threat. The
following lists the threat levels and the combinations of analysis-based factors used to determine
the level:
   A3.2.1. HIGH: Anti-US terrorists are operationally active and use large casualty-
   producing attacks as their preferred method of operation. There is a substantial DOD
   presence and the operating environment favors the terrorist.
   A3.2.2. SIGNIFICANT: Anti-US terrorists are present and attack personnel as their
   preferred method of operation or a group uses large casualty producing attacks as their
   preferred method, but has limited operational activity. The operating environment is neutral.
   A3.2.3. MODERATE: Terrorists are present, but there are no indications of anti-US
   activity. The operating environment favors the Host Nation/US.
   A3.2.4. LOW: No group is detected or the group activity is non-threatening.
A3.3. Terrorist threat levels are a product of the following four factors.
   A3.3.1. Operational Capability. This factor focuses on the attack methods used by the
   group and other measures that enhance its effectiveness, such as state sponsorship and
   ingenious use of technology. The key element is whether the group has the capability and
   willingness to conduct large casualty producing attacks, for example a suicide vehicle bomb
   containing thousand of kilograms of explosives or WMD timed to kill the most personnel at
   the target. Groups that selectively assassinate individuals or conduct late night bombings
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 28 MAY 2010                                                                   75


  causing limited property damage pose a decreasing threat. The ability to operate on a
  regional or transnational basis and the overall professionalism of the group is also assessed.
  A3.3.2. Intentions. This factor is the stated desire or history of terrorist attacks against U.S.
  interests. Recent substantial attacks in the country or, if the group is transnational, the
  conduct of operations in other countries is the higher end of the threat scale. This is
  especially true if the intentions are anti-DOD. The basis of the group ideology, whether the
  group is more focused on the host nation rather than U.S. interests is the other key
  component. Whether the group will react to high profile U.S. led international events, such
  as intervention in the Balkans, is also considered and rated.
  A3.3.3. Activity. This factor is an assessment of the actions the group is conducting and
  whether that activity is focused on serious preparations for an attack. The highest threat is
  credible indications of U.S. targeting to include the movement of key operatives, final
  intelligence collection and movement of weapons to the target vicinity. Less threatening
  actions are contingency planning, training and logistical support. Activities that would make
  the group less likely to attack, such as robust fund raising or effective safe haven are
  considered. Whether the group has recently been disrupted by arrests or strikes on training
  camps will reduce the threat, at least in the short term.
  A3.3.4. Operating Environment. This factor rates how the overall environment influences
  the ability, opportunity and motivation to attack DOD interests in a given location. An
  important element of this factor is the capability of the host nation security apparatus to
  combat terrorism, its degree of cooperation with the U.S. and the quality of the reporting on
  terrorist groups in the country. A key element is whether there is a DOD presence and if so
  the type, size, location, political sensitivity and if temporary, its duration. It is also important
  to consider if the group is focused on DOD as its primary target for anti-US attacks. Another
  part of this factor is the overall political, economic and military stability of the country and
  its effect on the ability of a group to attack.

                                          Attachment 4
                RISK MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCING PROCESSES

A4.1. Overview. The commander has an inherent command responsibility to reduce risks that
threaten the mission with available resources. Risk management described in AFPD 31-1, aids
the commander in assessing risk. If the commander cannot internally correct, mitigate or assume
risk, they must elevate these vulnerabilities and associated risk(s) through CVAMP. CVAMP
will forward the vulnerability through the chain of command to the GCC, who will decide if the
vulnerability will be reported higher.
A4.2. Resourcing. Emphasis should be placed on acquiring resources to detect, assess, warn,
defend or recover in order to prevent hostile acts or mitigate the effects. It is inherent upon the
organization to assess the resource requirement against other organizational unfunded or funded
requirements and determine if an internal reallocation of funding is appropriate and possible.
CVAMP is used to collate and track AT vulnerabilities and resourcing. The status of
vulnerabilities entered into CVAMP should be documented in CVAMP.
A4.3. AF Funding Sources.
   A4.3.1. Planning, Programming, Budget and Execution (PPB&E). The PPB&E process
   includes requests considered during the POM funding cycle. This program is for long term
   planning and the funds will not be available for two to five years. Information on the
   PPB&E process can be found in the DOD Management Initiative Decision 913.
   A4.3.2. Installation and MAJCOM budget process and commander’s discretionary funds.
   A4.3.3. Many PEC and/or funding appropriations (AT, Physical Security, EM, Medical,
   Construction, Base Defense, Base Operating Support, Communications, Weapons of Mass
   Destruction Threat Response; Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defense Program; Fire
   Emergency Services; Sustainment Restoration and Modernization (SRM) and military
   construction (MILCON), etc.) may be used to fund AT resourcing activities. Commanders
   will consider all PEC and Funding Appropriation sources as authorized by law and AF policy
   and guidance.
   A4.3.4. Use Antiterrorism Program Element 28047F as the primary funding source for
   manpower authorizations, antiterrorism equipment, procurement, military construction and
   the associated costs specifically identified and measurable to those resources and activities
   associated with the Air Force AT Program.
   A4.3.5. Specialized funds designed for AT and the war on terrorism.
A4.4. Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiative Fund (CbT-RIF). This program was
established by Congress and is managed by the Joint Staff (J-3). It provides funds for emergency
or unforeseen (emergent) high priority force protection projects or equipment. It is designed for
requirements that need to be funded in the current fiscal year and provides a means for the GCC
to react to unforeseen requirements from changes in a terrorist threat, threat levels, force
protection doctrine/standards, as well as unanticipated requirements identified as a result of VAs,
tactical operations and exercising AT Plans. If maintenance funds for CbT-RIF projects are not
programmed and provided from the parent Service, CbT-RIF can be used to fund maintenance
costs for those CbT-RIF-funded items during the year of purchase and the subsequent year as a
AFI10-245_PACAFSUP_I 28 MAY 2010                                                              77


temporary measure to permit the Service adequate time to program life-cycle costs. The fund is
not intended to subsidize ongoing projects, supplement budget shortfalls, or support routine
activities, which are a Service responsibility. Requests must be submitted through the
responsible MAJCOM and GCC, per GCC policies, to the Joint Staff. Submission instructions
are outlined in CJCSI 5261.01E, Combating Terrorism Readiness Initiatives Fund.
   A4.4.1. Emergency CbT-RIF Requirement. An unanticipated requirement created by a
   combination of circumstances or the resulting state that requires immediate action to prevent,
   deter, or respond to a terrorist act.
   A4.4.2. Emergent CbT-RIF Requirement. A newly formed, unexpected requirement
   resulting from a logical consequence of unforeseen circumstances calling for prompt action.
   A4.4.3. GCCs must submit requests for CbT-RIF funds through CVAMP.
   A4.4.4. Emergent requirements should be less than 2 years old. The requestor must have an
   approved, executable and exercised AT Plan.
A4.5. Effectively Managing the Resource Allocation Process.
   A4.5.1. Ensure you plan for training and maintenance costs into the out years.
   A4.5.2. The ATO needs to work closely with affected functional areas, installation financial
   advisors/comptroller and contracting from the beginning to address requirements. This will
   assist in identifying the appropriation sources and funding amounts.
   A4.5.3. Adequately articulating and justifying requirements is crucial.
   A4.5.4. Determine all appropriate potential funding sources and submit requests through the
   various channels. Once a requirement is funded by a source, cancel the other requests. Note:
   The Joint Staff does not allow the same request to be submitted through both the PPB&E and
   CbT-RIF process.
   A4.5.5. There are organizations that can aid the commander in identifying technology to
   satisfy requirements: Physical Security Equipment Action Group (PSEAG), Technical
   Support Working Group (TSWG), AFSFC Concepts Division, Joint Requirement Office for
   Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JRO-CBRND) and the Joint Non-
   Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD). These organizations are separately funded to provide
   COTS information, rapid prototyping and research and development and/or evaluation of
   solutions for units in the field. They can provide information and research on technology and
   equipment evaluated and deemed suitable for your purpose. Additionally, they can provide
   field assessments to assist in identifying the optimal solutions to meet your requirements.
