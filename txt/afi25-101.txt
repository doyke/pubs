                                           WRM PROGRAM

1.1. WRM Basis:
    1.1.1. WRM comprises Service-owned resources positioned as either starter or swing stock, or a com-
    bination of both, to maximize worldwide warfighting capability. The AF WRM program links the
    positioning of resources with theater air campaigns via the component USAF War and Mobilization
    Plan, Volume 4 (WMP-4)/Wartime Aircraft Activity Report (WAAR). Using the starter/swing
    approach, components are authorized WRM consistent with WMP-4 activity for the approved force
    structure over the duration of the starter time period (see WMP-1, Annex E for specific time periods).
    Starter stocks are those assets required at or near the point of intended use until air and sea lines of
    communications (LOCs) are capable of sustaining operations. Swing stock is the total OPLAN/CON-
    PLAN/Bomber forward operating locations (FOL) requirement minus the starter stock. Swing stocks
    are positioned to maximize flexibility to support multiple theaters. When inventory levels are insuffi-
    cient to fully support requirements, AF/IL makes the final determination on where assets will be
    stored. WRM is based on wartime additive requirements sufficient to accomplish the Strategic Plan-
    ning Guidance (SPG) strategy.
    1.1.2. WRM is authorized for wartime. With proper approval/authorization and funding, it may be
    used for Small Scale Contingency (SSC), Noncombatant Evacuation Operation (NEO), steady state
    Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF), Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) exercises, and emergencies.
    The use of WRM should be contingent upon the impact on our ability to support the National Military
    Strategy. As a minimum, critical factors such as airlift cost, operational timeliness, other sources of
    support and the ability and timeliness of reconstituting WRM assets must be considered.
    1.1.3. Excess WRM assets may be retained in the overall AF inventory if approved as Future Force
    Expansion (FFE) or Contingency Retention Stocks (CRS). See WMP 1, Annex E, for qualification of
    WRM in this category. WRM retained under these categories will not be authorized replacement.
    USAF/ILG, in conjunction with Storing Commands, annually reviews the strategy supporting FFE
    and CRS equipment and the subsequent need for this equipment.
    1.1.4. Air Force units may use existing WRM assets with proper MAJCOM approval to support AEF
    taskings.

1.2. WRM Authorizations:
    1.2.1. WRM authorization source documents for OPLAN tasked WRM are the War Consumables
    Distribution Objective (WCDO), War Plans Additive Requirements Report (WPARR), Vehicle
    Authorization List (VAL), Funded Level Rations Requirements (FLRR) letter, Inventory Management
    Plan (IMP), and Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) listings for BEAR, Fuels Mobility Sup-
    port Equipment (FMSE) and Vehicles. Upon receipt of WRM authorization documents, the appropri-
    ate munitions activity will load the non-vehicular authorizations. Vehicular authorizations will be
    loaded into the appropriate vehicle management system by the MAJCOM vehicle activity using the
    approved VAL. For munitions, the Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO) follows AF
    21-101, Management and Maintenance of Non-nuclear Munitions, for WRM munitions management
    guidance. Recommendations to identify items that require special consideration in the WRM selection
    are submitted, with complete justification, through the appropriate MAJCOMs.

1.3. Physical Security and Classification Guidance:
   1.3.1. Determine appropriate physical security measures on the basis of local security threat assess-
   ments, storage facility configuration and the type of WRM stored. Cite specific Military Plans or
   applicable Security Classification Guides when classifying WRM items or information.
   1.3.2. On-hand quantities/inventory levels by themselves are UNCLASSIFIED when the following
   are not disclosed or discussed:
      1.3.2.1. References to a specific plan.
      1.3.2.2. Assessments of wartime requirements against on-hand quantities (base or theater) as it
      relates to specific warfighting capability (e.g., LOGFAC assessment of an OPlan).
      1.3.2.3. Theater starter time periods for war consumable non-munitions and munitions assets (See
      Non-nuclear Consumables Annual Analysis (NCAA). Cite the Munitions Security Classification
      Guide when classifying munitions information).
      1.3.2.4. The units the stocks are intended to support.
      1.3.2.5. C-day for establishment of resupply.
   1.3.3. Cite the Material Management Division (HQ USAF/ILGM) as Originating Classification
   Authority (OCA) for guidance listed above.
   1.3.4. Originating Classification Authority is AF/ILG for any combination resulting in classification.

      Director of Logistics Readiness
      DCS/Installations and Logistics
      REASON: 1.5(a) Military Plans DECLASSIFY ON: X-4
   1.3.5. The MAJCOM/Air Component War Reserve Materiel Officer (WRMO), War Reserve Materiel
   Non Commissioned Officer (WRMNCO), Supply and Munitions War Reserve Materiel Manager
   (WRMM) positions will be coded as requiring a TOP SECRET clearance.
      1.3.5.1. The installation level WRMO, WRMNCO, Supply and Munitions WRMM positions will
      be coded as requiring a SECRET clearance. The War Reserve Materiel Program Manager
      (WRMPM) will identify other installation WRMM functional positions security requirements.
      1.3.5.2. All individuals discussing WRM information via non-secure telephone/Non-secure Inter-
      net Protocol Network (NIPRNET) circuits are responsible for ensuring conversations and commu-
      nications are limited to non-sensitive information. Secure telephone systems/Secure Internet
      Protocol Network (SIPRNET) must be used for discussion of any classified or sensitive informa-
      tion. Much of the required written coordination between agencies on WRM matters, though not
      specifically classified, is of possible intelligence value, especially when aggregated. Information
      of a sensitive nature (not otherwise classified) should be transmitted via unclassified encrypt for
      transmission only (EFTO) message as a minimum-security measure. Units not having this secure
      communications capability will use first class mail and applicable security procedures.
   1.3.6. WCDO and WPARR Classification:
8                                                                                 AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


    1.3.7. All WCDO products are subject to declassification according to Executive Order (EO) 12958,
    Classified National Security Information, and 32 CFR. Part 2001, implementing directive for EO
    12958; specifically, paragraph 1.6., Duration of Classification. The office of origin will be the Direc-
    torate of Operations and Training. The date of preparation will be the date used for controlling the
    WCDO. The WCDO is classified based on the classification for each line of activity in the WMP-4.
    The minimum classification for any WCDO extract (unit/base) is SECRET. Appropriate classification
    is controlled by program logic for both the standard and non-standard WCDO printed documents.
    Reasons for classification will be “1.5a,g”; refer to EO 12958, section 1.5, for a detailed description of
    the aforementioned reason. Declassification for these documents, at a minimum, will be marked
    “X-Military Plans” or “X3/4.” See EO 12958 for detailed explanation of the minimum markings.
       1.3.7.1. Pseudo-base codes (contained in the WCDO) or WRM base code (contained in the
       WPARR) is used to depict base locations. These codes can be accessed in Logistics Feasibility
       Analysis Capability (LOGFAC) in the base cross-reference data. Pseudo-base codes (WCDO)
       and/or WRM base codes (WPARR) when associated with the actual location or Geographical/
       Base Location Code (GEOLOC) are classified. Consult specific classification guide for proper
       handling.
       1.3.7.2. Composition Codes (Comp Codes) are four-position, alphanumeric identification codes
       used to account for WRM equipment allocations under Allowance Standards (AS). Comp Codes
       by themselves are unclassified. Certain Comp Codes associated with unclassified allowance stan-
       dard are unclassified. Comp Codes when associated with a classified allowance standard or Mis-
       sion Design Series (MDS) are classified SECRET to prevent disclosure of wartime missions of
       specific bases reporting this WRM equipment.

1.4. WRM Outload Planning:
    1.4.1. WRM resources stored at an Alternate Storage Location requiring transportation to the Planned
    Operating Base will be identified in the applicable JOPES OPlan using existing WRM HFW-series
    and HHW-series UTCs in a ULN Force Record. In-place WRM UTCs will be also identified by ULN
    to indicate prepositioned WRM. Storing Commands will determine transportation mode. See para-
    graph 2.13.4.4. for responsibilities.
    1.4.2. Ensuring WRM wartime outload capability is a coordinated function between planning, stor-
    ing/maintaining and transportation functions. The WRMO/NCO has overall responsibility to ensure
    this process is properly coordinated and briefed at the WRM Review Board.
    1.4.3. Units storing WRM must document movement/outload requirements (to include MAJCOMs
    centrally storing WRM) in the Expeditionary Site Plan (ESP). This information will include as a min-
    imum the specifics on how WRM will be moved to the point of intended use to meet Contingency/
    Wartime taskings. Any problems will be addressed at the WRM Review Board, and if necessary, to
    the MAJCOM to help rectify. WRM capability should be incorporated into Part 1 of the ESP. For
    OPLAN tasked WRM, ensure outload criteria are commensurate with OPLAN timing and exercised
    as determined by the WRMPM. OPLAN criteria should be addressed in Part 2 of the ESP. Starter
    WRM not stored at the location of intended wartime use will be identified as Alternate Storage Loca-
    tion (ASL) assets.
       1.4.3.1. WRMO/NCO assesses starter stock assets at ASL for mission impact. The asset is identi-
       fied to the applicable Command War Reserve Materiel Manager (CWRMM) for the plan(s)
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                         9


     affected to ensure OPLAN/CONPLAN supportability. LIMFACs/shortfalls are identified through
     the ESP process.

  is not required if off-base use is only temporary, i.e., less than 24 hours, or can be recalled in 24 hours.
  3.4.6. Out-of-Commission Joint Use Equipment. If JU equipment is expected to be out-of-commis-
  sion for more than 30 days, the functional user will notify the WRMO/NCO. The functional user will
  also provide an estimated repair date and the date of repair.
  3.4.7. Changes to JU Status. When JU equipment status changes, the LRS Customer Service Element
  will notify the WRMO/NCO in writing. The WRMO/NCO, in turn, will ensure the change in status is
  briefed at the next WRM Review Board. The LRS Customer Service Element ensures all required
  AFMAN 23-110 actions are taken. When a WRM requirement is deleted for an item designated as JU
  and the peacetime support requirement continues to exist, convert the authorization records to an
  authorized/in-use detail record reflecting use code B/K.
  3.4.8. Recall of JU WRM Vehicles:
     3.4.8.1. The WRMO/NCO will direct a periodic (recommended semiannually) recall of JU WRM
     vehicles. Only vehicles coded joint-use on the VAL are subject to recall. If the wartime end-user
     and the peacetime end-user is the same, the vehicle is not recalled, but inspected during the unit
     surveillance visit. This recall may be conducted in conjunction with the surveillance visit of the
     Vehicle Management Flight.
     3.4.8.2. Vehicles recalled will be inspected for serviceability and safety. Vehicles should be
     released after inspection unless they do not meet inspection criteria. Those vehicles not passing
     the inspection must be turned into Vehicle Maintenance for corrective action.
     3.4.8.3. Vehicle Management Flight will note the time each organization is notified of recall. Any
     vehicle not delivered within two hours should be identified as an item for WRM Review Board
     discussion to determine whether recall coordination requires improvement or the vehicle is an
     unsatisfactory JU WRM candidate.
     3.4.8.4. Recalled vehicles not meeting safe serviceable shipment criteria IAW TO 36-1-191, Tech-
     nical and Managerial Reference for Motor Vehicle Maintenance, will be identified in the exercise/
     inspection report and corrective action briefed to the WRM Review Board. User related discrepan-
     cies will be answered by the using organization Commander.
     3.4.8.5. WRM and JU WRM vehicles will remain under the local authority and control of the LRS
     through the Vehicle Fleet Manager.

3.5. Excess WRM:
  3.5.1. Excess WRM should be redistributed to bases with WRM shortages whenever possible.
  3.5.2. WRM equipment (except vehicles) excesses will be released by the CWRMO to fill MAJCOM
  WRM shortages. If no shortages exist within the Command, offer the asset to the other MAJCOMs to
  fill their WRM shortages. Process excesses for redistribution/disposition instructions through the Item
  Manager.
32                                                                               AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


     3.5.3. WRM consumable excess will be analyzed by the CWRMO to determine financial feasibility
     and criticality of movement to fill shortages within the MAJCOM. If no shortage exists within the
     MAJCOM and it is a critical item and financially feasible to redistribute, offer the excess to the other
     MAJCOMs. If no WRM shortages exist or it is not financially feasible to redistribute, absorb into pri-
     mary operating stock. For critical WRM assets, the AF commodity manager must be notified.
     3.5.4. Second Destination Transportation (SDT) funding requirements are determined jointly by the
     CWRMO/NCO and WRMMs for equipment and non-munitions consumable assets. The requirement
     is passed to the Transportation function to be included in their budget submission, with a courtesy
     copy of the requirements provided to the WRMO/NCO.
        3.5.4.1. The MAJCOM Transportation function consolidates WRM SDT funding requirements
        and provides this information to HQ AFMC/FMBO.

3.6. WRM Financial Management:
     3.6.1. Programming. WRM programming requirements are identified as part of the AF POM. Each
     MAJCOM submits a POM input for WRM Operation & Maintenance (O&M/Appn 3400) and Sup-
     port Equipment requirements over 250K(Appn 3010/3080).
     3.6.2. Budget and Execution. For O&M funding, bases through their MAJCOMs submit annual
     budget requirements in the RCS DD COMP (AR) 1092 Financial Plan (FinPlan) that is integrated into
     the MAJCOM FinPlan. The MAJCOM/FM submits their FinPlan to SAF/FM. Budget execution for
     the Air Force begins with SAF/FM by annual funding distribution to MAJCOM/FM, and with the
     assistance of the MAJCOM Program Element Manager (PEM), the MAJCOM/FM makes distribution
     to the bases where WRM funds are executed.
     3.6.3. WRM Program Element Managers.
     3.6.4. Support Equipment. WRM equipment has been decentralized to the MAJCOMs for program-
     ming in their respective POM input. Support equipment is programmed as follows:
        3.6.4.1. Initial aircraft WRM support equipment is programmed in Appropriation 3010, BP 10,
        using the weapon system Program Element Code (PEC).
        3.6.4.2. WRM support equipment budget code A requirements are programmed in Appropriation
        3010, BP12, using the weapon system Program Element Code for shortages and replacement
        items.
        3.6.4.3. WRM support equipment budget code M requirements are programmed in Appropriation
        3080, BP 84, using the Vehicle and Support Equipment PECs appropriate to each MAJCOM (i.e.,
        22834F, 42834F, 52834F, 52844F, 72832F, 82834F) for initial and replacement items.
        3.6.4.4. BEAR systems requirements are programmed in PEC 41135F within multiple appropria-
        tions as necessary.
        3.6.4.5. WRM support equipment budget code Y requirements are programmed in Appro-
        priation 3400, using the Vehicle and Support Equipment PECs appropriate to each MAJCOM
        (i.e., 22834F, 42834F, 52834F, 52844F, 72832F, 82834F) for initial and replacement items.
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                               33


  3.6.5. CWRMO/NCO will:
     3.6.5.1. As the Using MAJCOM ensure WRM initial and replacement support equipment require-
     ments are programmed in the MAJCOM POM submission.
     3.6.5.2. Develop and submit Command WRM budget requirements. Review installation annual
     WRM Financial Plans for accuracy and provide the Command budget office annual WRM budget
     requirements.
     3.6.5.3. Establish WRM annual distribution targets for installations storing WRM based on Com-
     mand priorities.
     3.6.5.4. Monitor budget execution and reallocate funding as required.
     3.6.5.5. Validate and approve unfunded requirements in the Command Budget Execution Report
     (BER).
     3.6.5.6. Exception. HQ AFMC will supplement the unique budget process for their Command.
  3.6.6. Installation WRM Financial Management.
     3.6.6.1. The WRMO/NCO will be the Resource Advisor for PECs 28030F and 28031F and is
     responsible for coordinating, compiling, analyzing, and submitting an annual budget to the Base
     FM Budget office. If a resource advisor (RA) is assigned within the squadron or group, then the
     RA will assist the WRMO/NCO in managing WRM sustainment funds. Each appointed WRMO/
     NCO will be trained in Resource Management System (RMS) IAW AFI 65-601, Vol 2, Budget
     Management for Operations.
     3.6.6.2. The WRMO/NCO will attend the Financial Working Group to justify and defend WRM
     funding requirements. The WRMPM will attend the Financial Management Board to ensure
     WRM funds are properly projected and distributed.
     3.6.6.3. WRMMs submit an annual Operations & Maintenance budget (PEC 28030F and 28031F)
     to the WRMO/NCO to project WRM expenditures for storage, maintenance, reconstitution, and/
     or program management of WRM assets. The WRMO/NCO reviews annual WRMM inputs to
     ensure planned expenditures are valid and submits the budget to the WRMPM for approval. ANG
     units will send WRM budgets to ANG/LGX where they will be compiled, validated, and for-
     warded to gaining MAJCOMs.
     3.6.6.4. The WRMO/NCO will provide FM with the funding targets for each WRMM’s organiza-
     tion RC/CC from the annual distribution from MAJCOM and subsequently from other distribu-
     tions. The WRMO/NCO will monitor WRMM expenditures using FM and Supply Funds
     Management Reports.
     3.6.6.5. Unfunded WRM requirements are identified by the WRMO/NCO semi-annually during
     the Budget Execution Report. WRM BER requirements are submitted through the base FM office
     typically twice a year in January and June and presented for consideration at the Financial Work-
     ing Group/Financial Management Board (FWG/FMB). ANG units will follow their local FWG/
     FMB procedures and forward their requirements to ANG/LGX for forwarding to gaining MAJ-
     COMs FWG/FMB.
34                                                                            AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


     3.6.7. Base Level WRM Funding Structure.
        3.6.7.1. The base FM manages the sustainment WRM funding within Budget Activity (BA) code
        02 for PEC 28030F and 28031F. FM works directly with the WRMO/NCO on WRM Financial
        Plans, BER, and distribution. Resource Center/Cost Centers (RC/CC) are established for each
        organization providing WRM functional management. The Materiel Support Element will estab-
        lish a separate organizational/shop code for each WRM activity. Organizations with more than one
        functional responsibility may establish additional shop codes for each activity, i.e., Equipment
        Maintenance Squadron maintaining aircraft support equipment and racks, adapters, and pylons
        (RAP).
        3.6.7.2. The WRMPM may authorize issue of Government Purchase Cards (GPC) for PECs
        28030F and 28031F expenses. If authorized, the munitions WRMM will be the GPC cardholder
        for PEC 28030F expenses. The WRM GPC card approving authority for cards issued to WRMMs
        using PEC 28030F and 28031F will be the WRMO/NCO.
        3.6.7.3. The following are examples of authorized expenditures in direct/unique support of
        WRM:
           3.6.7.3.1. Individual equipment and Temporary Duty (TDY) for travel required for WRM
           management, inspection, inventory, and asset rotation when approved by the WRMO.
           3.6.7.3.2. Costs of contract labor, maintenance, repair, reconstitution and storage of WRM
           assets.
           3.6.7.3.3. Equipment and vehicle maintenance tools, supplies, spare parts, and POL products
           required to inspect and repair WRM assets. EXCEPTION: If a similar use code A or B asset is
           on hand requiring the same level of maintenance, tools required to maintain a WRM asset will
           be purchased by organization O&M.
           3.6.7.3.4. Budget code 8 (Materiel Support Division, MSD) and 9 (General Support Division,
           GSD) WRM shortages when not for initial buy or when assets cannot be charged to a using
           organization.
           3.6.7.3.5. Costs of WRM support obtained through support agreements.
           3.6.7.3.6. Equipment (budget code 9) required for direct support of WRM, if no similar peace-
           time asset is available.
           3.6.7.3.7. Costs of the use of a Rapid Area Distribution Support (RADS) team or depot field
           team to repair, maintain, or reconstitute WRM assets when HQ AFMC does not fund cost.
           3.6.7.3.8. Costs in support of units whose sole mission is support and management of WRM
           assets (e.g., BEAR and STAMP/STRAPP squadrons).
           3.6.7.3.9. WRM Units that possess use code “D” pallets may use PEC 28031F, 28030F or
           41135F to purchase tie down straps, pallet couplers, net racks, dunnage and unit level mainte-
           nance of WRM pallets and nets.
               3.6.7.3.9.1. Only BEAR, FMSE and STRAPP may purchase Internal Slingable Unit (ISU)

                                                Chapter 4

                            WRM REQUIREMENTS DETERMINATION

4.1. WRM Requirements Objective:
     4.1.1. WRM is pre-positioned based upon critical factors such as transportation constraints, opera-
     tional timeliness, and cost. Consider these factors to determine total wartime requirements for a POB.
     Viewing this as a layered process, the first layer considers authorized primary operating stock (POS)
     for in-place forces. The second layer adds WRM pre-positioning requirements for wartime additive
     forces/missions documented in the WMP-4. The next layer is deployment assets requiring transporta-
     tion, as defined in the OPLAN TPFDDs. Finally, deployment assets that cannot be delivered within
     the OPLAN required delivery date (RDD) are considered for pre-positioning as WRM. In summary,
     WRM and POS provide an interim operational capability that is augmented by deployment assets to
     provide a full operational capability. WRM requirements/authorization documents include WCDO,
     WPARR, VAL, P&N letter, IMP, FLRR letter. These are explained in further detail in this chapter.

4.2. War Consumable Distribution Objective (WCDO):
     4.2.1. The WCDO provides the WRM pre-positioning objective for consumables in support of War-
     time Aircraft Activity (WAA) forces identified in the US Air Force WMP-4 (Wartime Aircraft Activ-
     ity Report). All the major categories of war consumables are calculated using WCDO procedures, i.e.,
     POL products, munitions and miscellaneous items (film, dropsondes, non-explosive chaff, rations,
     etc.).
     4.2.2. MAJCOMs will produce the WCDO authorizing WRM non-munitions/munitions consumables
     using the procedures contained in Chapter 8. Installation WCDO processing duties are contained in
     paragraph 8.6.

4.3. War Plans Additive Requirements Report (WPARR):
     4.3.1. The WPARR identifies and authorizes WRM in addition to POS and deployment assets (see
     Attachment 2, WPARR, Part One, format). Air Components, through their MAJCOM, use the
     WPARR to identify wartime additive requirements to support anticipated activity reflected in plan-
     ning documents. The WPARR is compiled based on equipment authorizations in the Allowance Stan-
     dards, support MRSP, and spares MRSP.
     4.3.2. The WPARR has two parts. Part I is used MAJCOM to MAJCOM to identify requirements by
     location. The WPARR, Part II consists of WPARR Part I requirements (using MAJCOM approved
     requirements) and the theater/Storing Command Base Operating Support (BOS) requirements to sup-
     port incoming forces. MAJCOMs with theater planning/storage responsibilities (to include ANG) pre-
     pare the WPARR, Part II.
        4.3.2.1. WPARR, Part I Process: MAJCOMs will ensure assets included in deploying UTCs are
        not duplicated in WPARR submissions except as noted in paragraphs 4.3.3.—4.3.7. MAJCOMs
        submit Part I of the WPARR NLT 1 Jun annually or more often as necessary (in conjunction with
        major WMP-4 revisions).
        4.3.2.2. Using MAJCOM identifies/validates requirements and ensures items are contained in the
        applicable WRM Allowance Standard. Where possible, WRM UTCs will be used to identify Part
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                37


     I requirements. WRM UTCs are developed for Aviation Flightline Support Equipment (HF
     series), Munitions Materiel Handling Equipment (HH series), and Materiel Handling Equipment
     (UF series) to facilitate logistics planning.
     4.3.2.3. During the requirements determination process the Using MAJCOM functional manager
     reviews current OPLAN TPFDD for shortfalls.
     4.3.2.4. Using MAJCOM functional manager forwards validated requirements to Using MAJ-
     COM/LGX/LGS for review and consolidation into WPARR, Part I.
     4.3.2.5. Using CWRMO/NCO, in coordination with Command Equipment Management, submits
     the WPARR, Part I working copy to the storing CWRMO/NCO. The WPARR, Part I is not loaded
     into Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) until both Using MAJCOM and Storing
     Command concur with the requirements. The Using MAJCOM will forward WPARR, Part I
     directly to ANG/LGX for locations where the ANG is the installation host WRMO/NCO.
     4.3.2.6. Storing CWRMO/NCO submits the validated requirements to the applicable functional
     area CWRMMs for review.
     4.3.2.7. Storing CWRMMs resolves any requirement issues with the Using CWRMM.
     4.3.2.8. The Storing CWRMM advises the Storing CWRMO/NCO of concurrence/disputed
     requirements.
     4.3.2.9. Storing CWRMO/NCO advises the Using CWRMO/NCO of concurrence or of any unre-
     solved issues NLT 30 June.
     4.3.2.10. Using CWRMO/NCO will work all unresolved issues. Requirements that are not
     resolved by Using MAJCOM and Storing Command will be considered at an impasse and will be
     removed from the WPARR, Part I to publish the document on schedule. Work impasse items sep-
     arately as out-of-cycle requirements.
     4.3.2.11. Using CWRMO/NCO will provide Storing CWRMO/NCO a new WPARR, Part I when
     unresolved issues are resolved. Using MAJCOM will load coordinated requirements into AFEMS
     resulting in the final WPARR, Part I. New Items identified as Additive Requirements will initially
     be listed on the WPARR as use code “D.”
     4.3.2.12. Storing Command will separate the final WPARR, Part I into equipment and vehicle
     requirements. The MAJCOM Supply function will approve the final WPARR, Part I equipment
     requirements in AFEMS, and MAJCOM Vehicle Management function will update final approved
     vehicle authorizations in the MAJCOM Automated Fleet Information System (MAFIS) Vehicle
     Authorization List using established practices.
  4.3.3. AFSOC WPARR requirements are not considered duplicative. AFSOC will identify worldwide
  WPARR requirements consistent with supporting current planning guidance.
  4.3.4. AMC is authorized to identify worldwide WPARR requirements consistent with supporting
  current planning guidance for global mobility taskforce support.
  4.3.5. ACC is authorized to identify WPARR requirements above UTC-based assets for the following
  weapons systems consistent with supporting current planning guidance: RC-135, E-8, E-4B, B-2,
  B-52, U-2, B-1, F-117, OA-10A, A-10A, F-16 C/D, F-15 C/D, and F-15E.
38                                                                            AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


     4.3.6. PACAF and USAFE are authorized to identify WPARR requirements due to transportation
     shortfalls.
     4.3.7. AFMC is only authorized to identify WPARR, Part I requirements for aircraft battle damage
     repair (ABDR) trailers to support documented OPLAN activity.
     4.3.8. The WPARR, Part II consists of WPARR, Part I requirements (using MAJCOM-approved
     requirement) and the Theater/Storing Command BOS requirements to support incoming forces.
     Equipment changes to the WPARR are initiated through the Transaction Allowance Change Request
     (TACR) process in AFEMS. The WPARR will contain all equipment requirements to include vehi-
     cles. Vehicles are documented in the WPARR process to ensure all requirements are identified; how-
     ever, the VAL process is used to authorize WRM vehicles. WPARR additive authorizations will be
     loaded into AFEMS by the MAJCOM Supply function. The MAJCOM Vehicle Management function
     will load vehicle authorizations in the VAL. Base vehicle authorizations will be loaded by the host
     base Logistics Readiness Squadron in the Registered Equipment Management System (REMS) using
     the MAJCOM VAL as the source document. Authorizations may be viewed through AFEMS viewing
     screen RWPR.
        4.3.8.1. The Storing CWRMO/NCO will provide the WPARR, Part Two, to the host installation
        with a letter of instruction to the WRMO/NCO NLT 15 August.
        4.3.8.2. The host installation WRMO/NCO and WRMMs will convene a Joint Use meeting and
        have all actions completed within 30 days of receipt of the WPARR Part II Joint Use Determina-
        tion Worksheet (Attachment 3) to include a copy of the JU meeting minutes forwarded to the host
        Command. MAJCOMs will determine JU procedures for vehicles. During the WRM JU meeting,
        WRMO/NCO and WRMMs will confirm that the vehicle can be JU. If JU of the vehicle is not fea-
        sible, the WRMO/NCO will forward a non-concurrence memo to the host Command CWRMO/
        NCO and Transportation function with rationale. If an initial authorization can be filled by a JU
        asset not previously identified, notify CWRMO/NCO and Transportation function. If an item is
        determined to be JU, provide the quantity to be JU, document number(s) of the assets to JU, and
        the peacetime allowance standard.
        4.3.8.3. Upon receipt of the JU meeting minutes, the Storing CWRMO/NCO will forward these
        JU requirements to the storing command supply function and vehicle management function. The
        Storing Command equipment management function will update the use code, “C” in AFEMS for
        JU equipment, while the Storing Command vehicle management function will direct the host base
        to update the use code “L” for JU vehicles in REMS. The LRS will update use code “C” in SBSS
        for non-regionalized bases and RSS will update it for all regionalized bases.
        4.3.8.4. The Storing Command Equipment Management function will distribute the updated
        WPARR, Part II to the host base Logistics Readiness Squadron/Unit or Regional Supply Squad-
        ron. The Storing Command Vehicle Management function will distribute an updated VAL to the
        host base Logistics Readiness Squadron vehicle management function.
        4.3.8.5. Units should submit Transaction Allowance Change Requests for WRM equipment
        authorization changes to their parent MAJCOM utilizing AFEMS. MAJCOMs will include
        approved changes (approved for pre-positioning) in their WPARR submission. If an item is cur-
        rently authorized in the WRM AS but is not in the WPARR, consult your parent MAJCOM for
        guidance. The WRM AS identifies the items required to support an MDS, but it does not mean an
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                  39


     item is authorized for pre-positioning. Inclusion in the WPARR identifies that item as a require-
     ment to pre-position.
  4.3.9. Joint Use:
     4.3.9.1. Joint Use equipment is equipment authorized to support a peacetime function that ceases
     to exist in wartime, thereby allowing the equipment to satisfy a wartime requirement. JU equip-
     ment can be used to satisfy WRM requirements versus ordering new equipment. All peacetime
     assets, to include those possessed by AF tenant units, are to be considered for JU application to
     wartime requirements by the installation.
     4.3.9.2. Upon receipt of the WPARR, Part II, the WRMO/NCO distributes a copy to the Supply
     and Transportation WRMMs. The Supply WRMM will identify all WPARR item National Stock
     Numbers and query AFEMS using the ACAL transaction to identify organizations on base pos-
     sessing the same asset with use code “B”, “C” and “D” (use code “A” equipment is not subject to
     JU). The Transportation WRMM will identify organizations on base possessing the same assets
     with “K”, “L” and “M” coded assets for verification/validation. The Supply and Transportation
     WRMMs will provide the listings with account custodian information to the WRMO/NCO. The
     WRMO/NCO will distribute the listings to the organizations possessing JU candidates.
     4.3.9.3. Affected organizations will make a JU determination prior to the JU meeting.
     4.3.9.4. The WRMO/NCO conducts/chairs the JU meeting. The WRM Supply POC, the Cus-
     tomer Service Element WRMM or monitor, the Vehicle WRMM, WRMNCO and representatives
     from all functional user organizations, including tenants/associates, who possess equipment to
     which JU could be applied, must attend the meeting. The following considerations may be made
     during your review:
         4.3.9.4.1. Review the new WPARR and identify changes to superseded versions.
         4.3.9.4.2. Review and validate peacetime equipment/vehicle authorizations (Use code “B”/
         ”K”) that could be coded JU (Use code “C”/”L”) to satisfy WRM authorizations. Review and
         validate all equipment/vehicles already in JU status.
         4.3.9.4.3. Review other sources of equipment that could reduce WRM assets applied to WRM
         authorizations (e.g., commercial sourcing/leasing).
         4.3.9.4.4. JU WRM is not restricted to items of the same NSN, nomenclature, or type. Any
         item that performs the same function as the WRM item can be considered for JU.
     4.3.9.5. Determine any excess/shortage created by the new WPARR, Part II and document it in
     the minutes.
     4.3.9.6. Set suspense dates for all JU meeting action items to be completed. The WRMO/NCO
     will include open JU action items in the agenda of the next WRM Review Board.
     4.3.9.7. Units will provide substantiating rationale for not applying JU or not obtaining support
     from other sources.
     4.3.9.8. When a peacetime authorization for a support item designated as JU is deleted or reduced
     to a level where JU application is not practical and the WRM requirement continues to exist, take
     appropriate action to re-accomplish JU determination for that asset. If JU cannot be applied, estab-
     lish the WRM requirement authorized/in-use detail record reflecting use code “D.”

4.4. WRM Vehicle Requirements:
     4.4.1. WRM vehicles are generally limited to those functional and critical vehicles required to per-
     form AF missions. All WRM vehicle requirements will be identified in the WPARR. The MAJCOM
     VAL is the source document for all vehicle authorizations. Storing Command vehicle functional
     managers will approve all authorizations for WRM.
     4.4.2. WRM vehicles not on the VAL, but reflected on the WPARR, Part II are provided for planning
     purposes only. Host Transportation function will determine how to support the WRM requirement and
     document the Expeditionary Support Plan, Transportation Annex accordingly. Vehicles must be avail-
     able to support the WAA timing. Unsupportable requirements will be forwarded to MAJCOM Logis-
     tic Plans and Transportation as a shortfall. MAJCOM Transportation will determine how to support
     the requirement from Command resources or notify the Using MAJCOM to deploy the asset and
     update the ULN force record in the OPLAN TPFDD.
     4.4.3. General-purpose WRM vehicle requirements will be identified in the WPARR, but are only
     approved for inclusion in the Storing Command VAL by exception by the MAJCOM WRMPM. Stor-
     ing Command functional managers will determine the supportability of general-purpose vehicles
     identified in the WPARR and Expeditionary Support Planning process. Functional managers will use
     joint use determination, commercial leasing, host nation support or other options to support require-
     ments. WRM pre-positioning will be authorized by exception only. Certain contingency base oriented
     UTCs may include general purpose vehicles with the minimum number required pre-positioned as
     WRM to sustain operations at contingency locations where commercial or Host Nation provided
     resources are unavailable. General-purpose vehicles in these types of UTCs must be approved by the
     Manpower and Equipment Force Packaging System (MEFPAK) reporting MAJCOM LG (or equiva-
     lent) prior to the UTC being forwarded to AF/XOXW/ILGM for submission into the Type Unit Char-
     acteristics Data File (TUCHA) and registration of the UTC.

4.5. 463L System Support Equipment:
     4.5.1. 463L system pallets and nets used for unit deployment are no longer designated as WRM. See
     AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, for guidance and procedures for management of
     deployment 463L resources.
     4.5.2. 463L pallets and nets required for movement of WRM assets are designated as WRM. These
     assets are managed according to DoD 4500.9R, Volume VI, Management and Control of Intermodal
     Containers and System 463-L Equipment. These assets are stored and maintained by the unit storing
     WRM unless centralized storage has been approved by the WRMPM.
     4.5.3. WRM pallet and net authorization to support WRM movement will be listed in the applicable
     WRM Allowance Standard. WRM pallet and net authorizations will be loaded into AFEMS to enable
     visibility of authorizations. Authorization changes due to Logistics Detail (LOGDET) or Air Force
     Worldwide UTC Summary (AFWUS) tasking will be accomplished using a TACR.
     4.5.4. The MAJCOM CWRMO/NCO will use the WPARR (Part I and II as applicable) to establish
     WRM pallet requirements.
        4.5.4.1. WRM pallet and net requirements for STRAPP/STAMP movement requirements will be
        documented on the WPARR, Part II.
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                 41


   4.5.5. HQ AMC determines Non-Unit Move (NUM) requirements (i.e., sustainment, mail, and Civil
   Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF)) for all NUM cargo originating at an AMC CONUS major Aerial Port of
   Embarkation (APOE) for the first 90 days. HQ AMC submits these requirements directly to the AF
   item manager. Stand-by APOE requirements will be submitted to the AFMC pallet and net monitor.
   4.5.6. MAJCOMs will supplement this instruction with guidance to ensure RCS: MTC-DR (M&Q)
   8701 reporting.

4.6. Engines:
   4.6.1. Engines are not managed under the WRM program. See AFI 21-104, Selective Management of
   Selected Gas Turbine Engines. War Readiness Engines (WRE) are managed by the respective SRAN
   Engine Managers (MAJCOM or base as appropriate).

4.7. Base Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) Systems: BEAR requirements are addressed in
Chapter 7.

4.8. WRM Subsistence:
   4.8.1. Air Components with responsibility to a geographic Commander and MAJCOMs with WRM
   planning responsibilities determine subsistence requirements using the most current WMP-4 and
   OPLAN Time Phased Force Deployment Data. MAJCOM SVX will provide data to AF/ILVX using
   a population build, by day, by location, for each OPLAN. This data will be provided upon request
   from AF/ILVX or annually as determined by AF/ILVR. The most stringent theater CONPLAN can be
   used in lieu of an OPLAN for determining requirements. MAJCOM/SVX is responsible for determin-
   ing total requirements with the assistance of the theater MAJCOM LGX (or equivalent).
   4.8.2. MAJCOM functional managers compute rations requirements for their stand-alone units that
   are tasked by Air Force Worldwide UTC Summary to deploy with rations. These requirements will be
   sent to the MAJCOM SVX for transmittal to HQ AFSVA/SVOH. Supported theaters will identify to s
   those theater locations that require self-sustaining units to deploy with WRM rations supported by
   their home station. Supported theaters will provide s this information NLT 31 January of each year to
   allow s time to gather data to submit requirements to HQ AFSVA/SVOHF by 15 March of each year.
   4.8.3. Commands will compute WRM rations requirements as follows:
      4.8.3.1. Aircrew requirements are computed by the CWRMO in LOGFAC and identified on the
      WCDO.
      4.8.3.2. Self-sustaining units are computed by functional managers and reported to MAJCOM
      Services.
   4.8.4. Requirements determination for subsistence computations is based upon WMP-1, Annex GG
   guidance. Computation may include three types of meals:
      4.8.4.1. Type 1R, (A Rations) meal requiring refrigeration and preparation.
      4.8.4.2. Type 1S, (Unitized Group Rations [UGR]) meal requiring food preparation but no refrig-
      eration.
      4.8.4.3. Type 1C, (Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MRE) or equivalent) meal requiring no food preparation
      or refrigeration.

     4.8.5. The installation host Services (SVS) officer manages the wartime subsistence program with the
     assistance of the host base WRMO.
        4.8.5.1. WRM rations are ordered, paid for, and owned by HQ AFSVA/SVOHF.
     4.8.6. Units with adequate dining facilities/contract service are authorized to substitute box lunches
     for aircrew MREs at the discretion of the Services Officer in coordination with the WRMO/NCO. If
     meals can be provided locally please notify Command/LGX by letter with justification so that MREs
     can be removed from your WCDO.
     4.8.7. Use of Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF): Reference WMP-1, Annex E for use of CRAF for
     movement of WRM subsistence.
     4.8.8. Subsistence is provided for the missile reconstitution force as well as missile crews. Rations
     stored at Launch Control Facilities will be the responsibility of the facility manager. The facility man-
     ager will provide the WRMO/NCO with the results of the facility inspection. This report must contain
     the quantity of rations on-hand, condition, and shelf life expiration date.

4.9. Non-nuclear Consumables Annual Analysis (NCAA), Munitions Requirements: T h e N C A A
quantitatively identifies the most effective mix of conventional air munitions to be programmed for pro-
curement and maintained in the WRM stockpile. The NCAA addresses requirements for air-to-surface
and air-to-air conventional munitions, and Tanks, Racks, Adapters and Pylons. The NCAA also describes
the methodology for determining requirements for the Rapid Response Swing Stocks, which include
bomber flyaway munitions, Standard Air Munitions Packages, Standard Tank, Rack, Adapter, and Pylon
Packages, and the Afloat Pre-positioning Fleet.

                             MAINTENANCE, STORAGE, AND MARKING

5.1. WRM Storage Objectives:
      5.1.1. Maintain WRM to ensure readiness for any authorized contingency. WRM should be main-
      tained by organizations possessing similar assets to ensure technical competence and familiarity with
      asset storage and maintenance requirements. Organizations managing contract maintenance of WRM
      are responsible to ensure the condition and readiness of the WRM assets. Table 5.1. below outlines
      the general organizational responsibilities for maintaining WRM. The table is not directive, but out-
      lines customary responsibilities.

5.2. WRM Maintenance:
     5.2.1. Identify WRM maintenance requirements through inspections or scheduling in accordance
     with applicable Technical Orders or equivalent technical guidance. Workcards provide primary
     inspection criteria.
     5.2.2. Establish maintenance priorities consistent with other non-WRM assets to include corrosion
     control, maintenance planning and scheduling, Time Compliance Technical Order compliance, appro-
     priate priority for requisitioning repair parts (i.e., if the end item has a MICAP reportable standard
     reporting designator [SRD] and is on the Command Mission Essential Level [MEL], Urgency Justifi-
     cation Code of 1G or JG is appropriate) and maintaining required records and forms.
     5.2.3. Inspection and Maintenance Intervals:
        5.2.3.1. WRM is inspected annually based on the following: assets without a technical order, or
        specified inspection interval are inspected to include serviceability verification, based on a ran-
        dom sampling of at least 25% of each category of WRM items. Centrally stored WRM can be
        inspected to coincide with other functional requirements such as supply inventory inspections, or
        at an interval and percentage approved by the CWRMO. Increase frequency if climatic or environ-
        mental conditions require it. HQ AFMC/LGMW ensures assets stored at Army depots are prop-
        erly stored, inspected, and maintained.
        5.2.3.2. Initial acceptance inspections are conducted within 60 calendar days of asset receipt and
        documented on the appropriate form or in the supporting automated system.
            5.2.3.2.1. The 60-day inspection requirement does not apply to Buy-By-Set deliveries. In lieu
            of 60 days, each unit will have up to 120 days to accept, inspect, inventory and store a BEAR
            set. Waivers to exceed the 120-day rule will be granted by AF/ILGM on a case-by-case basis.
     5.2.4. WRM Vehicles Maintenance:
        5.2.4.1. Rotate WRM vehicles with active fleet vehicles, where possible, to ensure the maximum
        degree of WRM fleet serviceability. Do not place vehicles in replacement code status A through J
        into WRM. The Storing Command will develop WRM vehicle rotation policy and ensure bases
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                   45


     formulate a rotation plan designed to equalize use of like vehicles. Vehicles being rotated into or
     out of storage must be in TO 36-1-191 condition and current on all inspections.
     5.2.4.2. To the maximum extent possible, integrate special purpose (i.e. aircraft refuelers, ambu-
     lances, crash rescue fire fighting vehicles, etc.) and Material Handling Equipment vehicular assets
     with POS to ensure serviceability. Use special purpose or tactical vehicles that do not have a
     peacetime role, or that receive limited peacetime use, to ensure their serviceability. Units may also
     integrate de-icing trucks, latrine servicing trucks, Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Liquid Nitrogen
     (LIN) servicing units with peacetime units to ensure serviceability. Integrated assets will be prop-
     erly marked IAW paragraph 5.3.7.
        5.2.4.2.1. Integration requests will be sent from the using organizational Commander to the
        WRMO/NCO. The WRMPM will approve/disapprove integration of pure WRM assets. These
        letters will be kept on file by the WRMO/NCO.
        5.2.4.2.2. Quarterly, mid-month Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct, the WRMO/NCO should request a utiliza-
        tion report for integrated vehicles, and comparative analysis of integrated WRM vehicle utili-
        zation to like assets within the assigned organizations, from the servicing Vehicle Management
        and Analysis section. The analysis should be used by the WRMO/NCO to identify potential
        excessive use of WRM vehicles as compared to use of like peacetime operating stock assets
        within the assigned organizations, and to identify instances where WRM vehicles are solely
        used in lieu of peacetime operating stock vehicles. Instances where it is perceived integrated
        WRM vehicles are being used excessively that cannot be resolved at the installation level with
        be forwarded to the MAJCOM WRM and Vehicle staffs for joint resolution.
     5.2.4.3. Maintenance management of WRM vehicles must comply with the policies and proce-
     dures in AFI 24-302, Vehicle Management, and TO 36-1-191, Technical and Managerial Refer-
     ence for Motor Vehicle Maintenance. Do not place vehicles in WRM without repairing them
     according to approved procedures. Do not place vehicles in WRM storage while the vehicle war-
     ranty is valid if a POS requirement exists at the storage location.
        5.2.4.3.1. Vehicle maintenance scheduling, priorities and inspection will be established and
        accomplished IAW TO 36-1-191 and AFI 24-302, respectively.
     5.2.4.4. JU vehicles recalled will be inspected for serviceability and safety. Vehicles should be
     released after inspection unless they do not meet inspection criteria. Those vehicles not passing
     the inspection must be turned into Vehicle Management for corrective action.
  5.2.5. WRM Support Equipment Maintenance:
     5.2.5.1. Support equipment will not be integrated for use with peacetime support equipment
     (except as designated in 5.2.4.2.). It will be operated to extend the service life and maintain its
     readiness. The level/frequency of use will be set by the Air Staff functional manager to ensure
     readiness. Maintenance Information Systems (MIS) (CAMS and GO81) will be used to monitor
     readiness status.
     5.2.5.2. There are three levels of inspection for WRM support equipment: visual, serviceability,
     and TO compliance.
        5.2.5.2.1. Visually inspect WRM equipment quarterly. Open containers to allow inspection.
        Inspections can be done as part of the WRM surveillance visit described in Chapter 3, during
        ORIs, UCIs, etc., or by the custodian, WRMM, or program element manager. All assets should
46                                                                           AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


          be checked during each condition inspection; however, 25 percent is the minimum inspection
          requirement. Inspections will be documented in MIS and on appropriate equipment mainte-
          nance forms (e.g., AFTO Form 244, Industrial/Support Equipment Record). Assets with dis-
          crepancies will be scheduled for maintenance.
NOTE: Chaff crates and containers only need to be opened if visual damage is apparent or the barrier
paper is wet or torn, in which case specific inspection requirements in TO 12P3-1-8, Inspection Proce-
dures--All RR/AL Chaff (Non Pyrotechnic), will be followed.
          5.2.5.2.2. Perform WRM serviceability inspections annually. WRM equipment will be
          mechanically/electrically tested, as applicable, to ensure they are ready to perform their war-
          time mission. Serviceability inspections will be done by the functional user or by the base
          function that has the capability to perform them.
       5.2.5.3. Powered AGE.
          5.2.5.3.1. The term Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) is defined in TO 00-20-1, Aero-
          space Equipment Maintenance General Policies and Procedures. Joint use WRM AGE will be
          maintained IAW specific equipment technical orders and work cards. When AGE is desig-
          nated as pure WRM, perform all inspections prior to storage. When WRM equipment is placed
          in storage, comply with inspection requirements in TO 35-1-4, Processing and Inspection of
          Support Equipment for Storage and Shipment, in lieu of calendar inspections. While stored
          outside, inspect AGE at 18-month intervals; while stored inside, inspect at 24-month intervals;
          while stored in climatically controlled environments, inspect at 36-month intervals. Qualified
          maintenance technicians will perform servicing inspections, functional checks, load checks (as
          applicable), and minor corrosion control treatment on serviceable powered AGE every 180
          days. Load checks on flightline diesel engine generator sets are to be sustained for a minimum
          of 15 minutes. Periodic inspections will be accomplished IAW above guidance and TO
          00-20-1, chapter 7, following the guidance for annual inspections contained in the applicable
          Air Force periodic inspection workcards. In those areas where weather or storage condition
          have a deteriorating effect on powered AGE, or when circuitry load checks on weapon sys-
          tems are beyond normal static run-up procedures, the applicable equipment item will be dis-
          patched for a period not to exceed 24 hours to complete the functional check. Such dispatch
          will be accomplished based on a written schedule from the AGE WRMM and approved by the
          WRMPM.
       5.2.5.4. Nonpowered AGE.
          5.2.5.4.1. JU Nonpowered AGE will be maintained IAW specific equipment technical orders
          and work cards. When Nonpowered AGE is designated as pure WRM, perform all inspections
          prior to storage. When WRM equipment is placed in storage, comply with inspection require-
          ments in TO 35-1-4 in lieu of calendar inspections. While stored outside, inspect AGE at
          18-month intervals; while stored inside, inspect at 24-month intervals; while stored in cli-
          mate-controlled environments, inspect at 36-month intervals. Periodic inspections will be
          accomplished IAW above guidance and TO 00-20-1, chapter 7, following the guidance for
          annual inspections contained in the applicable Air Force periodic inspection workcards. Func-
          tional checks and minor corrosion treatment will be accomplished every 180 days. If equip-
          ment is stored outside, more frequent inspections may be necessary based on weather
          conditions, equipment condition, and/or equipment configuration.
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                  47


     5.2.5.5. Fire Extinguishers. The installation fire department will ensure records are maintained on
     WRM fire extinguishers. The records will list the extinguisher by type, serial number, location,
     maintenance, hydrostatic test due dates, date of last inspection, and name of inspector. AF IMT
     1071, Inspection/Maintenance Record, or automated methods will be used to document the above
     information. Applicable directives on the inspection of fire extinguishers are: NFPA Standard #10
     (portable fire extinguishers); 13F4-401 and 13F4-4-111 (wheeled HALON 1211 type units); and
     appropriate manufacturers brochures on portable hand type Halon, Dry Chemical, and Water Fire
     Extinguishers.
  5.2.6. Aircraft External Fuel Tanks:
     5.2.6.1. Inspection Intervals and Procedures (Built-up Tanks). The inspection interval for built-up
     tanks is related to their storage location. Inspection intervals for WRM built-up tanks can be found
     in applicable 6J14 series Technical Order. As a minimum, monthly walk-through inspection of
     tank storage areas will be conducted. The monthly walk-through will inspect for damaged assets,
     shipping/storage containers, and missing/damaged protective coverings. Fuel tanks will be stored
     only in approved shipping/storage containers according to TO 00-85A-03-1, Preservation, Pack-
     aging and Packing--External Aircraft Fuel Tanks/Cells. Discrepancies found during a
     walk-through will be corrected immediately or scheduled for maintenance.
     5.2.6.2. The “next inspection” block of the condition tag (DD Form 1574) shows the month/year
     the tank will be scheduled based on the method the tank is stored and the data appearing in the
     “inspected by/date block” on the tag. Units will develop a program to monitor/track the inspection
     interval of WRM tanks to include a procedure for reporting tank status. When the method of stor-
     age for built-up tanks changes, there will be a corresponding change in the maintenance interval.
     Annotate this change on the report developed and used for the locally designed program to track
     inspection intervals. If a change in storage improves the protection of the tanks, the condition tag
     and the locally developed report will remain the same. This criterion applies due to the tanks being
     subjected to the outside environment. The period of exposure is irrelevant. If the change in the
     method of storage decreases the protection for the tanks, the condition tag and the locally devel-
     oped report will be changed to reflect the earliest inspection due date.
     5.2.6.3. Since cannistered tanks are not processed through maintenance on a periodic basis, the
     “next inspection due” column on the locally designed report for cannistered tanks will indicate, for
     example, 202 (2nd quarter required and CY 2002).
     5.2.6.4. WRM built-up tanks will be inspected for condition of serviceability IAW applicable
     6J14 series TO. Tanks will be prepared for storage according to TO 0085A-03-1.
     5.2.6.5. Built-up tanks will be included in the base corrosion control program and maintenance/
     inspections will be based on the storage and climatic conditions (TO 1-1-691, Aircraft Weapons
     Systems--Cleaning and Corrosion Control) to which the tanks are subjected.
     5.2.6.6. Inspection Intervals and Procedures (Cannistered Tanks). Cannistered tanks will not be
     processed into maintenance on a scheduled periodic basis except when canisters are scheduled for
     corrosion control treatment. During the monthly walk-through inspection, canisters will be
     inspected for pink or white humidity indicators, excessive corrosion, and punctures. Canisters
     found in this condition will be scheduled for maintenance. Canisters will also be scheduled into
     maintenance when contents are required to be built-up.
48                                                                               AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


        5.2.6.7. With respect to corrosion control and maintenance, canisters will be given the same pri-
        ority as built-up tanks. Canisters will be prepared for storage and inspected according to TO
        0085A-03-1. Corrosion control and maintenance will be performed on those canisters deteriorated
        to the point where moisture could damage the tanks or result in having to build-up the tanks.

5.3. WRM Storage Objectives:
     5.3.1. WRM assets will be primarily stored at the wartime POB. If storage shortfalls exist at the POB,
     or if storage is unavailable/inaccessible at the POB, WRM will be stored at an alternate storage loca-
     tion (ASL). Alternate storage locations are determined in the following priority sequence: storage at
     an Air Force or DoD installation through a support agreement, host nation support (HNS), local con-
     tract storage (except munitions) or centrally stored.
     5.3.2. WRM is stored and marked to achieve and maintain a continuous state of readiness, and to
     make assets readily identifiable and to prevent inadvertent use. Additionally, WRM must be brought
     out of stored configuration and be ready to use at the POB or ready to transport from the ASL to the
     POB to support the timing established in the wartime aircraft activity.
     5.3.3. Storing activities must be able to store, and perform scheduled rotations, inspection intervals,
     and required maintenance. Local capabilities must be assessed to ensure adequate support can be pro-
     vided. Storing activities must address shortfalls to the Storing Command so that support can be
     arranged or an ASL designated to meet WRM storage requirements.
     5.3.4. Storage Methods:
        5.3.4.1. Commands, through the storing activity, ensure WRM is stored efficiently and effectively
        to maximize asset serviceability with available resources. WRM is stored in descending preferen-
        tial order: climate-controlled facilities, non-climate controlled inside facilities, outside covered
        storage, or outside uncovered storage. Ensure security is configured on basis of storage facility
        configuration, type WRM stored, and local threat.
        5.3.4.2. When dedicated storage is not feasible or available, store WRM as outlined below:
            5.3.4.2.1. Commingle consumable WRM assets with POS including bulk storage. When
            assets are commingled, ensure shelf life coded items are identified and use a bin label, placard,
            or other means available to clearly identify the WRM level.
            5.3.4.2.2. Segregate WRM equipment, when storing with like equipment. Where WRM is
            stored together with similar assets, mark pure WRM IAW paragraph 5.3.7.
            5.3.4.2.3. Integrated equipment, such as aircraft refuelers, ambulances, crash and fire vehi-
            cles, and all materiel handling equipment are mixed with the storing installation vehicle fleet
            so that the refueling, agent dispensing, and hydraulic mechanisms can be exercised to ensure
            serviceability. Integrated assets will be marked with a WRM triangle.
        5.3.4.3. Long-term storage is encouraged when the WRM can be generated to full serviceability
        by the Storing Command maintenance activity. Command approval is required for all long-term
        storage requests and adjustments to maintenance intervals. Commands will develop inspection
        programs for assets centrally stored in long-term storage.
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                    49


  5.3.5. Storage Shortfalls/Facility Management.
     5.3.5.1. Storage shortfalls associated with WRM pre-positioning requirements will be identified
     by the storing functional activity to the host Civil Engineer Squadron Real Estate Branch for reso-
     lution IAW AFI 32-9002, Chapter 2.1, Use of Real Property Facilities. At non-Air Force loca-
     tions, follow the host service directive. If local storage capabilities are inadequate, ensure the
     WRMPM (through the WRMO/NCO) is knowledgeable of WRM storage shortfalls and efforts to
     correct the deficiency. The storing activity must consider programming for new storage facilities
     through the Civil Engineer Squadron.
     5.3.5.2. Determine whether WPARR, Part II additions create a storage shortfall.
     5.3.5.3. After all local capabilities have been exhausted, identify storage shortfalls to Storing
     Command/CE and inform the CWRMO.
  5.3.6. WRM Storage Funding: WRM storage expenses will be budgeted in the storing activity’s
  WRM Financial Plan. The Storing Command will ensure storage funding is programmed in the POM.
  WRM Funds can be expended for long-term storage supplies and equipment. See Chapter 3 for more
  specific details on funding.
  5.3.7. WRM Marking:
     5.3.7.1. Mark all pure WRM equipment (use code “D”) and vehicles (use code "M”) with a solid
     black triangle. Markings must be of an appropriate size in relation to the size of equipment item
     being marked. See Attachment 5 for rules to enhance WRM marking.
     5.3.7.2. WRM munitions and bulk petroleum products are exempt from WRM marking.
     5.3.7.3. Marking of WRM commodities other than equipment:
         5.3.7.3.1. Use a bin label (R/D38/GV837, Ref. AFM 23-110, Vol. II, Part Two, Chapter 6,
         Attachment B-38) and placard to mark consumables. The sign or placard will include the solid
         black triangle and the statement "WRM - DO NOT ISSUE BELOW (indicate WRM level
         from WCDO).”
         5.3.7.3.2. For the purpose of WRM marking, a sign is defined as a freestanding informational
         marker affixed to a post, pole, stake, or stanchion. A placard is an informational marker
         attached or affixed to an item, group of items, or facility. Materials used for signs and placards
         will be durable to reduce frequent replacement due to fair wear and tear and exposure to the
         weather. Use a sign that is easily viewed and comparable in size to the asset stored (use com-
         mon sense).
     5.3.7.4. WRM commodities will be marked with an appropriate identification/condition tag
     (when applicable).
     5.3.7.5. As equipment items are removed from WRM status, change the use codes and immedi-
     ately remove the WRM triangular markings.

                                              USE OF WRM

6.1. Use of WRM:
     6.1.1. WRM supports the full range of DoD missions within our National Military Strategy (MCO/
     SSC/NEO, etc.). Accordingly, use of WRM is restricted to ensure sufficient capability to support Uni-
     fied Combatant Commander requirements. Use must be approved only after considering the impact on
     our ability to support the National Military Strategy, and the ability and timeliness of reconstituting
     the WRM assets. WRM use is comprised of two categories, Direct and Indirect Mission Support as
     defined below.
        6.1.1.1. Direct Mission Support: Used to support JCS taskings (MCO/SSC/NEO, etc.) through a
        Unified Combatant Commander/JTF/CTF. These taskings should have an associated Plan ID
        (PID) and are sourced using JOPES procedures through GCCS.
        6.1.1.2. Indirect Mission Support: For events other than those in 6.1.1.1., including Steady State
        AEF taskings, Joint and Air Force Exercises, training events, competitions (e.g., Readiness Chal-
        lenge), and unit exercises. Use request and approval is as described in paragraphs 6.2. and 6.3.,
        and Table 6.1.
            6.1.1.2.1. If an in-place WRM item is required frequently to support indirect mission needs,
            authorizations for this item should be reviewed and consideration made to increase the POS
            authorization.
            6.1.1.2.2. Prior to using WRM for indirect mission support, managers at all levels are respon-
            sible for protecting WRM from non-wartime use. Requesting organizations should make every
            effort to satisfy peacetime needs though the use of primary operating stocks (POS), alternative
            means of support, i.e., Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) items, contractor support, host
            nation support, acquisition and cross servicing agreements, commercial replacement items and
            non-Air Force sources. Indirect mission support usage will be briefed at WRM Review
            Boards.
            6.1.1.2.3. The appropriate WRMPM (installation, MAJCOM or HQ USAF) is designated the
            WRM release authority for approving use requests. The MAJCOM WRMPM may delegate
            authority to the CWRMO/NCO.

6.2. Release Authority:
     6.2.1. The installation WRMPM is the releasing authority for indirect mission support WRM requests
     for specific items for periods up to 30 days as noted in Table 6.1..
     6.2.2. The MAJCOM WRMPM (and USCENTAF/A-4) with logistics responsibility for the Area of
     Responsibility (AOR), as identified in the LOGFAC Base Cross-reference module, has release author-
     ity for WRM exceeding the installation WRMPM authority. The MAJCOM WRMPM may authorize
     WRM use for up to 180 days. Requests for more than 180 days must be approved by AF/ILGM.
     6.2.3. HQ USAF/ILGM approval is mandatory for releasing WRM to non-USAF customers, WRM
     usage in excess of 180 days and inviolate BEAR Systems.

                        MAJCOM’s CWRMO
                        must be notified.


NOTES:
     1. If the requested WRM is swing stock stored for an MCO component (PACAF/USCENTAF)
        the releasing MAJCOM must coordinate the request with the designated MCO component
        through AF/ILGM prior to releasing the WRM.
        2. An organization requiring use of WRM support equipment for 30 days or longer will request
           approval from the Storing Command. The Storing Command will coordinate with the Using
           MAJCOM to ensure proper Command and control of WRM resources and to avoid WRM use
           conflicts. The Storing Command will notify the requester of the Using MAJCOM’s decision
           after coordination.
        3. All items released for Indirect Mission Support must be available for recall within 24 hours if
           required for contingency/wartime (Direct Mission Support) use.
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                     53


6.3. Release Procedures:
   6.3.1. Direct Mission Support. Requests to use WRM for Direct Mission Support are initiated by the
   supported Air Component to USAF/ILGM. USAF/ILGM determines if WRM will be approved for
   the specific contingency/PID and notifies all WRM Storing Commands that WRM is approved for the
   specific PID. Tasking and coordination is through JOPES procedures. Funding documents are not
   required for release of WRM for Direct Mission Support. The Storing Command will identify recon-
   stitution costs, and seek reimbursement using the applicable ESP code for the operation.
      6.3.1.1. To preclude delays of WRM use and to allow deploying forces to tailor their deployment
      packages to the greatest extent possible, the Supported Air Component should include an approval
      statement for WRM use in applicable Deployment Orders (DEPORD), Request for Forces (RFF),
      Planning Orders, etc.
   6.3.2. Indirect Mission Support. Requests to use WRM for Indirect Mission support are initiated by
   the using organization (e.g., Operations Squadrons for war consumable munitions) and submitted to
   the installation WRMO/NCO for action. Submit WRM Indirect use request in writing using the for-
   mat in Attachment 4. The WRMO/NCO will review the request and submit it to the WRMPM for
   approval/disapproval. WRM use requests exceeding installation level approval authority will include
   the WRMPM’s recommendation for approval/disapproval when elevated to MAJCOM for action.
   When required, use requests are forwarded to the next approval level by the WRMO/NCO through the
   appropriate WRMPM.
      6.3.2.1. Fund cite information from AF IMT, 616 Obligation Authority or DD Form 448, Military
      Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR) will be provided by requesting unit prior to release of
      assets by the MAJCOM or Theater A4. Using organization will be assessed fees for service prior
      to use based on the historical cost for each asset used. Commands are encouraged to maintain data
      to determine historical cost. If historical costs are not available, use the following to estimate use
      cost. For use of 31 days and above, 15 percent of total asset cost; for use of 30 days and less, 10
      percent of total asset cost. The Storing Command may negotiate the assessed cost with the User.
      Additional costs associated with use will be assessed as incurred. MAJCOMs will ensure units
      budget for these type costs when event is known in advance.
      6.3.2.2. When WRM assets are approved for use, the user is responsible for all costs associated
      with use to include packing, crating, transportation to and from the employment site, TDY costs
      for personnel deploying with the assets, contractor costs as applicable, reconstitution/repair of
      assets, MRSP costs, etc. (this list is not all inclusive).
   6.3.3. Exercise support. WRM may be used for exercise support provided the host unit exhausts all
   methods of support, the MCO mission is not degraded, and applicable funding documents are pro-
   vided. The Exercise Support Plan (ESP) may substitute as the WRM Use Request, provided all the
   conditions of indirect support usage are met. Release approval is contingent upon receipt of funding
   documentation from the using organizations and will be reflected in the WRM and funding annex of
   the ESP. The appropriate coordination must be obtained from the WRM approval level for the com-
   modities to be issued. The WRMO is responsible for ensuring the ESP meets the WRM use approval
   criteria in Table 6.1. and paragraph 6.2.3. (i.e., Air Staff must approve issue of WRM to non-AF
   units).
54                                                                               AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


     6.3.4. The using organization must appoint, in writing, a responsible individual to receipt for, control
     and return all WRM. Designated individuals are comparable to Supply Equipment Custodians and
     must be in the grade of E-5 or above.

6.4. Accountability:
     6.4.1. WRM consumables are issued through either SBSS or CAS to the using organization.
     6.4.2. WRM Support Equipment. During force rotations, the using organization will identify in
     advance the next equipment custodian to sign for the WRM. A joint inventory will be conducted at
     that time. Equipment custodians should be identified to the deployed PERSCO team to flag custodians
     and ensure transfer of custodianship with the Storing Command custodian prior to the individual’s
     departure.
     6.4.3. Periods less than 30 days. Issue of WRM for periods less than 30 days requires at a minimum,
     preparation of an AF Form 1297 or locally acceptable form, and signature of the receiving custodian.
     WRM issued for periods of 30 days or more requires the preparation of an R14 (an SBSS-generated
     report).
     6.4.4. If the mission support extends past six months, the theater LG and CE functional managers
     should attempt to transition to more permanent assets or contract support for required capabilities and
     begin reconstitution of WRM assets immediately.
     6.4.5. For cases of abuse during use of WRM, see AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force
     Property, for procedures.

6.5. Sustainment/Employment: The using organization is responsible for all maintenance of issued
WRM, to include funding and ordering replacement parts. Any maintenance that is beyond the capability
of the using organization must be identified to the Storing Command. The Storing Command may assist
in identifying alternatives to obtain the necessary support. Applicable funding documents will be required
by the supported Command to assist with contract support.

6.6. Turn-in Procedures: The storing organization representative, in conjunction with the Using organi-
zation Custodian, must document the return of WRM and identify the status of the asset and if required,
an estimated repair date. This information must be reported to release authority for assets that require
prior approval. The notification will be sent to the same agencies included in the request message

6.7. Redeployment: WRM assets that were deployed to the POB require transportation back to the orig-
inal location, such as intra-theater centralized storage, or inter-theater storage location. Request transpor-
tation of Direct Mission WRM use assets in JOPES. Indirect WRM use transportation will be the
responsibility of the using organization to arrange.

6.8. Reconstitution: MAJCOMS storing WRM will fund for the reconstitution of WRM following con-
tingency use. When provided, use the applicable Emergency and Special Project (ESP) codes (Air Force
or MAJCOM supplied) established to track costs for contingencies, exercises, etc. This data is used to:
     6.8.1. Bill/reimburse for replenishment.
     6.8.2. Request supplemental appropriations.
     6.8.3. Record unprogrammed costs for budget preparation.

                  BASIC EXPEDITIONARY AIRFIELD RESOURCES (BEAR)

7.1. General: BEAR is a critical Agile Combat Support (ACS) capability. It provides vital equipment
and supplies necessary to beddown and support combat forces at expeditionary sites with limited infra-
structure and support facilities. As a minimum, each location must have a runway and parking ramp suit-
able for aircraft operations and a source of water that can be made potable.

7.2. BEAR
   7.2.1. BEAR consists of a variety of systems and equipment, such as personnel shelters, aircraft shel-
   ters, food service facilities and equipment, hygiene facilities, power and water production and distri-
   bution equipment, heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration equipment, vehicles, runway lighting,
   vehicle maintenance equipment, civil engineering equipment and associated spares configured into
   Mobility Readiness Spares Packages (MRSPs). When combined, these systems and equipment
   make-up the infrastructure needed to establish an air base in a deployed environment. BEAR, is man-
   aged as a weapon system.
   7.2.2. Units responsible for managing BEAR, to include contractor management must maintain 463L
   pallets and nets in sufficient numbers to support the movement of BEAR. BEAR assets are authorized
   use of Ship Store containers to meet TO configuration/packing requirements. BEAR is used in the
   standard AF LOGDET.

7.3. BEAR Unit Type Codes (UTC):
   7.3.1. BEAR Systems and equipment are aggregated into UTC “sets” or “packages” to provide ACS
   capability. BEAR sets are designed to be scalable, module, and agile. BEAR sets include the Swift
   BEAR 150 Personnel Housekeeping Set, the BEAR 550 Initial Housekeeping Set, 550 Follow-On
   Housekeeping Set, the Industrial Operations Set, the Initial Flightline Set, and the Follow-On Flight-
   line Set. With the exception of the Swift BEAR 150 Personnel Housekeeping Set, each “core” BEAR
   set has “augmentation UTCs”referred to as “Playbook Options” (see below). BEAR sets also include
   legacy sets such as Harvest Eagle and Harvest Falcon, but these sets are being phased out as the new
   Force Module sets arrive.

Figure 7.1. BEAR Requirements Supporting OPLANS/CONPLANS/CONOPS/Training /Recon
Support Site.




NOTE: Eagle Flag sets are non-operational “training” sets. Recon (i.e. reconstitution) are operational
sets that can support OPLAN taskings. In addition, Recon sets provide the Air Force a “spare set” capa-
bility. Recon sets are stored at 49 MMG but will not be tasked in the AFWUS.
       7.3.1.1. Swift BEAR 150 Personnel Housekeeping (B-150) Set (UTC: XFB1A) The B-150 set
       supports up to 150 personnel in the Open-the-Base force module. The set consists of small shelters
       with environmental control, tactical power generators, limited hygiene facilities, camp lighting
       equipment and MRE rations and bottled water. A 10K all-terrain forklift is included for camp
       erection. SDCs to connect to a B-550I high voltage power grid are included as a Playbook Option.
       7.3.1.2. BEAR 550 Initial Housekeeping (B-550i) Set (UTC: XFB1H) The B-550i is a stand alone
       set that provides a robust camp consisting of billeting, feeding, and hygiene to support 550 person-
       nel. Billeting utilizes small shelters (tents) with cots for 12 people per shelter. A heat pump envi-
       ronmental control unit provides basic heating and cooling. Feeding is initially provided with a
       Single Pallet Expeditionary Kitchen (SPEK) which provides a limited feeding capability of 2 hots
       and 1 MRE per person per day. The 550 Kitchen can be deployed as a playbook option to provide
       full service dining capabilities for extended operations. Hygiene consists of latrines and
       shower-lavatory units. High and low voltage electrical and water systems are included. Shelters
       are provided for administration, mortuary, supply, base engineering and tactical field exchange
       functions. Self help laundry facilities, cold weather heaters, camoflague netting and concertina
       wire are included as playbook options as needed.
       7.3.1.3. BEAR 550 Follow-on Housekeeping (B-550f) Set (UTC: XFBBF). The B-550f is an
       additive set to the B-550i which increases support to 1100 people. The B-550f provides additional
       billeting, feeding, hygiene, power, water, environmental control and lighting assets similar to the
       B-550i. The 550 Kitchen can be deployed as a playbook option to provide added full service din-
       ing capacity. Self help laundry facilities, cold weather heaters, camoflague netting and concertina
       wire are included as playbook options as needed. There is no SPEK or additional shelters for base
       support functions. A B-550f is normally not deployed independent of a B-550i.
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                   57


     7.3.1.4. BEAR Industrial Operations (B-IO) Set (UTC: XFBIF). The B-IO is a stand alone set that
     provides base infrastructure maintenance and logistics support for a base of up to 3300 personnel
     and three fighter aircraft squadrons or their equivalent. The set consists of small, medium, and
     large shelters for functions such as Combat Supply, Base Civil Engineering, Vehicle Operations
     and Maintenance, TMO Packing and Crating, and other general purpose functions. It provides
     additional high voltage electrical power generation and distribution and environmental control.
     Water purification and storage systems, industrial flooring for selected facilities, cold weather
     heaters, concertina wire and other selected items are available as playbook options.
     7.3.1.5. BEAR Initial Flight Line (B-IF) Set (UTC: XFBIF). The B-IF set includes facilities,
     equipment, and supplies necessary to establish and support aircraft flight-related operations and
     maintenance activities for an initial aircraft squadron deployed at a bare base location. It includes
     small, medium and large industrial shelters for sheltering aircraft (ACH); operations facilities
     including aircrew alert and squadron operations; maintenance functions such as avionics, pow-
     ered/non-powered AGE, fuels laboratory, propulsion; and fire ops/crash rescue, storage, and other
     general purpose functions. Also, it provides a latrine and field lavatory designated for flightline
     operations. This set is dependent on a B-550i/f and B-IO for power and water support. Expedition-
     ary airfield lighting systems (EALS), mobile fighter aircraft arresting systems (MAAS), industrial
     flooring and cold weather heaters are available as playbook options. Up to two BEAR Follow-on
     Flightline (B-FF) Sets may be tasked with this package.
     7.3.1.6. BEAR Follow-on Flightline (B-FF) Set (UTC: XFBFF) The B-FF set is additive to a B-IF
     set and includes limited facilities, equipment, and supplies needed to support flight operations and
     maintenance needs for a second and subsequent squadrons deployed to an austere base. The set
     consists of an ACH, small and medium shelters for powered/non-powered AGE, propulsion, and
     general purpose functions. Industrial flooring for selected functions and cold weaters heaters are
     available as playbook options.
     7.3.1.7. Legacy Sets include Harvest Eagle (HE) and Harvest Falcon (HF) Housekeeping Sets and
     PACAF’s T-550 Housekeeping Sets. These Housekeeping Sets include shelters, kitchens and din-
     ing facilities, showers, latrines, self-help laundries, water purification, storage and distribution
     equipment, and environmental control equipment for heating and air conditioning. Each Harvest
     Eagle Housekeeping Set supports 550 personnel. Each Harvest Falcon Housekeeping Set includes
     assets sufficient to support 1100 personnel. PACAF Tailored Harvest Eagle 550 Person Contin-
     gency Support Packages (T550s) are patterned after, and similarly equipped, to Harvest Eagle sets.
     T550s support 550 personnel with billeting, kitchen, shower/shave, latrine, water production, stor-
     age and distribution, and power generation and distribution with environmental control units for
     air conditioning and heat. These packages do not include other base support services such as
     chapel, mortuary, self-help laundry, tactical field exchange, CE support, supply, etc.,. Legacy sets
     are being phased out of the inventory as new Force Module sets arrive. The last of the legacy sets
     are expected to be out of the inventory by fiscal year 10. MAJCOMs are authorized to maintain a
     Contingecy Reservice Stock of individual BEAR commodities such as tents, generators, etc., with
     the approval of AF/ILGM.
        7.3.1.7.1. The legacy "BEAR" equipment must be used before the new FM assets. All Force
        Module BEAR sets (B-550i/f, B-IO, B-IF,B-FF, B-150) will be inviolate. No individual
        commodity within the set will be used without prior approval from the respective MAJ-
58                                                                           AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


            COM and AF/ILGM. This is to insure that the entire set capability is preserved for war-
            time use.
     7.3.2. BEAR Vehicles. The following vehicles are authorized for deployment in direct support of
     BEAR Systems. These assets are used to move BEAR assets; position, erect, and service BEAR facil-
     ities; and sustain BEAR operations while deployed.

7.4. BEAR Systems SORTS Reporting:
     7.4.1. MAJCOMs are responsible for ensuring Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS)
     reporting is accomplished IAW AFI 10-201, Status of Resources and Training System. Storing Com-
     mands will designate units responsible for SORTS reporting of assigned BEAR Systems.
     7.4.2. Units storing BEAR assets report SORTS data against the missions stated in their Designed
     Operational Capability (DOC) statements. Each unit must determine and report their status based on
     the critical BEAR equipment assigned. Critical systems within the BEAR Program are listed and iden-
     tified in Attachment 10. Critical Item Listings for BEAR sets can be obtained from HQ ACC/LGXW.
     Reports are based only on critical assets authorized.
     7.4.3. The BEAR Monthly Status Report. Managed and published by HQ ACC/LGXW for AF/ILG.
     All BEAR commands will provide a BEAR Monthly Status Report to HQ ACC/ LGXW upon request
     IAW the following criteria. This criteria also applies to SORTS reporting:
        7.4.3.1. MC (GREEN) - Mission Capable - 100% of critical items on-hand. 75% of non critical
        items on-hand in garrison and all deployed sets.
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                     59


      7.4.3.2. PMC (YELLOW) - Partially Mission Capable - At least 50% of critical items on-hand. At
      least 50% of non critical items on-hand.
      7.4.3.3. NMC (RED) - Non Mission Capable - Less than 50% of critical items on-hand, or in
      reconstitution.

7.5. Mission Use of BEAR:
   7.5.1. BEAR supports the full range of DOD missions within our National Military Strategy (MCO/
   SSC/NEO, etc.) BEAR may be used only for direct mission support. Direct mission support is use of
   BEAR to support a Combatant Commander tasking, or approval by USAF/ILG. Indirect use of BEAR
   (i.e. training, exercises, etc.,) the approval of the applicable MAJCOM and USAF/ILG.
      7.5.1.1. For Direct Mission Support or Indirect Mission Support, Air Components deploying
      BEAR sets will ensure deployment of sufficient supply personnel, in accordance with UTC MIS-
      CAPs, to support the deployment, reception and sustainment of BEAR assets. This includes main-
      taining accountability of all equipment, vehicles, and MRSPs. Sufficient BEAR experienced
      supply personnel (UTCs XFBJ2, XFBKB, XFBPF, JFBBS, etc. and may include contract support)
      must stay with the BEAR assets for the duration of the employment to ensure proper BEAR sup-
      ply discipline and accountability. In addition, Civil Engineer Prime BEEF teams must be placed in
      the TPFDD for the set-up, sustainment, and teardown of BEAR camps. When required, 49 MMG
      UTC XFB1 “J1” Large Structure Teams and/or RED HORSE UTCs may be tasked for large struc-
      ture erection.
      7.5.1.2. Indirect Mission Support Use and Approval. Approval for use of BEAR sets for indirect
      mission support is limited. If required, they will initiate by the using organization and submitted to
      the installation WRMO/NCO for action with a strong justification.
          7.5.1.2.1. Submit BEAR indirect mission support use request in writing using the format in
          Attachment 4. The WRMO/NCO will review the request and submit it for approval as fol-
          lows:
             7.5.1.2.1.1. Wing/Unit WRMPM for use for periods of up to 72 hours and which will not
             adversely impact asset readiness to perform its primary mission.
             7.5.1.2.1.2. MAJCOM WRMPM for use periods greater than 72 hours, but less than 180
             days.
             7.5.1.2.1.3. AF/ILGM (through MAJCOM) for use periods greater than 180 days.
             7.5.1.2.1.4. AF/ILGM (through MAJCOM) for all use by non-AF users.
             7.5.1.2.1.5. AF/ILGM is the approval authority for all requests involving inviolate stock.
             7.5.1.2.1.6. The 49 MMG/CC/CD have release authority for BEAR assets under the fol-
             lowing conditions:
                 7.5.1.2.1.6.1. Training within the MMG compound.
                 7.5.1.2.1.6.2. Use on Holloman AFB, and the local area, for up to 72 hours.
                 7.5.1.2.1.6.3. Mobile Training Team assets when used for instruction, regardless of
                 use location.
60                                                                              AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


        7.5.1.3. The Air Component Supply function is responsible for determining and disseminating a
        Supply Concept of Operations for the deployment. This CONOPS will identify procedures for
        establishing and operating a BEAR Supply function and managing accountability of assets.
        7.5.1.4. Indirect mission support use is O&M funded by the using organization. The funding doc-
        ument from the user must stay open until all assets have been reconstituted.
     7.5.2. Employment/Sustainment:
        7.5.2.1. The contingency site CES has overall accountability and responsibility for maintaining
        the BEAR assets. The CES/CC signs the appropriate documentation and assumes responsibility of
        BEAR equipment assets. When deployed to support theater activities, 49 MMG and other AF sup-
        ply personnel (JFBBS) deployed in direct support of BEAR assets assist the CE commander in
        tracking and assigning responsibility to major users.
        7.5.2.2. Supply personnel deployed under BEAR UTCs work for the contingency site CES/CC to
        account for, requisition, and maintain accountability of BEAR assets. The contingency site BEAR
        supply personnel call in parts requirements and MRSP replenishment to the respective AOR
        Regional Supply Squadron (RSS), as required, when MRSP assets are consumed or do not contain
        the necessary parts.
        7.5.2.3. All BEAR MRSPs will be transferred before each deployment to the applicable Regional
        Supply Squadron IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol II, Part 2, Chap 26, paragraph 26.26.3.1. Transferred
        MRSPs will be under the control of the contingency site CES/CC until returned to home station.

7.6. Redeployment:
     7.6.1. Components may use a variety of options to redeploy BEAR assets to include Rapid Area Dis-
     tribution Support (RADS) teams, 49 MMG personnel, contractor personnel, or CE personnel. The
     goal for this phase is an orderly breakdown of BEAR assets so they can be redeployed and reconsti-
     tuted as quickly as possible. The contingency site CES must be relieved of accountability before rede-
     ploying.
     7.6.2. The contingency site CES, 49 MMG, and owning Air Component will do a joint inventory and
     review of accountable documentation. Once completed, the Storing Command will reassume respon-
     sibility.
     7.6.3. BEAR assets must be redeployed in a timely manner to ensure BEAR future contingency oper-
     ations readiness. Use of the BEAR Life Cycle Matrix is recommended for movement prioritization.
     7.6.4. If the supported command needs to keep all or a portion of BEAR assets deployed longer than
     6 months, the supported Air Component must provide AF/ILG and ACC/LGX a report citing the
     requirement, and plans for transitioning to more permanent facilities so BEAR assets retained will not
     remain on WRM accounts. All deployed BEAR assets will be redistributed to the Contingency Allow-
     ance Standard 058 after being deployed for 179 days or longer. The contingency site CES maintains
     accountability of the assets upon transfer (Redistribution Order [RDO]). MRSP consumables will be
     expensed to the contingency site CES upon transfer of applicable equipment. Establish levels under
     the contingency site Chief of Supply for any applicable XD2 MRSP assets. After the MRSP is
     expensed and levels are established, delete all applicable contingency site BEAR MRSP detail
     records.
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                       61


7.7. Transition from BEAR/WRM Assets:
   7.7.1. Operational scenarios frequently result in undetermined or extended deployment periods.
   Additionally, across the board replacement of BEAR assets is generally not operationally feasible.
   Therefore, deployed BEAR assets should be targeted for replacement/reconstitution in a prioritized
   method.
   7.7.2. On the 90th day of deployment, if across-the-board replacement is not feasible, Component LG
   and CE should authorize and direct CES/CCs to replace BEAR assets at a minimum IAW the general
   prioritization below. Locally procured resources or Air Component/AF-level resources (via AFCAP
   or theater-wide direct vendor contracts) can be used to obtain commercial replacements (contact
   BEAR Systems Office for assistance if required). The prioritization is based on relative importance of
   the commodity to BEAR capabilities, ease of replacement, and/or quality of life enhancements.
      7.7.2.1. Latrine and Shower/Shave units, Power Assets (generators, PDCs/PSCs, SDCs, ECUs,
      etc.), Kitchens, TF-1/2 Light Carts, Shelters. Shelters required for additive missions are better can-
      didates for alternative sourcing. Additionally, all shelters required for quality of life enhancements
      that are not incorporated into BEAR packages should be supported by commercial sources.
      7.7.2.2. Specialized assets that are more difficult to replace with commercial alternatives, such as
      arresting systems, reverse osmosis water purification units (ROWPUs), airfield lighting, etc. will
      generally not be targeted for early replacement. Assets targeted for replacement will be redeployed
      to the Air Component for reconstitution.
      7.7.2.3. Assets tasked to support joint operations at sites that are not commanded by AF personnel
      should be transferred IAW AFMAN 23-110, Vol II, Part Two, Chapter 22, Transfers to Non-AF
      Activities, at the 120-day point if alternative sources do not appear feasible.
      7.7.2.4. All fuel and water bladders should be transferred to the contingency CES/CC (AS058) at
      the time of deployment. There will be no reconstitution of bladders.

7.8. BEAR Reconstitution:
   7.8.1. When BEAR assets are approved for use, the user is responsible for all costs associated with
   use to include packing, crating, transportation to and from the employment site, TDY costs for person-
   nel deploying with the assets, contractor costs as applicable, reconstitution/repair of assets, and MRSP
   costs (this list is not all inclusive). For use less than 30 days, 10 percent of the cost of each item used
   must be deposited by Military Interdepartmental Purchase Request (MIPR)/AF IMT 616, Fund Cite
   Authorization, with the providing unit prior to equipment release. For use exceeding 30 days, the
   deposit required is 15 percent of each item. Funds in excess of those deposited for reconstitution will
   be returned to the user. Costs in excess of funds deposited will be charged to the user.
   7.8.2. Reconstitution will be conducted for all equipment, vehicles, and MRSPs, upon return of
   BEAR assets to home BEAR units as money and contractual limitations permit. Timelines should be
   evaluated as the situation unfolds. Once reconstitution is complete, the BEAR unit will submit an
   End-of-Deployment/Reconstitution Report to their applicable MAJCOM CWRMO/NCO and a sepa-
   rate copy to HQ ACC/LGXW. The BEAR End-of-Deployment/Reconstitution Report format can be
   found in Attachment 9.

7.9. Life Cycle Matrix:
     7.9.1. WR-ALC BEAR System Program Director (SPD), with input from 49 MMG/LGX (BEAR
     Pilot Unit) as well as ACC/LGXW, USCENTAF/LGXR, USAFE/A4OW, PACAF/LG-ALOCW,
     AMC/A45A, and AFCESA, as appropriate, will design and maintain a BEAR Life Cycle Matrix
     (LCM). The LCM will provide the basis for forecasting likely asset impacts and costs for training,
     storing, deploying, maintaining, reconstituting, and replacing BEAR equipment items. This product
     will be critical to enabling funding and asset procurement forecasts. LCM is critical to the POM pro-
     cess for initial, shortage, and replacement BEAR requirements.

7.10. BEAR Integrated Management Team (BIMT):
     7.10.1. Mission Statement. The Air Force BEAR Integrated Management Team (BIMT) ensures AF
     BEAR capability to meet DOD mission needs consistent with Unified Combatant Commander (UCC)
     requirements and overall AF and DOD policy and programming guidance for BEAR and related sys-
     tems as directed in Program Management Directive (PMD) 2054, Basic Expeditionary Airfield
     Resources. To achieve these goals, the BIMT is responsible for the full range of management actions
     necessary to program, fund, acquire, store, deploy, sustain, reconstitute, and upgrade AF BEAR
     assets.
     7.10.2. BIMT responsibilities are accomplished through a structure that encourages participation
     from all relevant MAJCOMs, associated agencies and organizations at appropriate levels of involve-
     ment. The multi-agency BEAR Integrated Product Team is the working level group responsible for
     managing day-to-day activities involving system requirements, configurations, upgrades, and
     resource programming. The multi-agency BEAR Systems Readiness Board is the senior-level board
     responsible for overall program oversight, guidance, and direction. The BEAR General Officer Steer-
     ing Group (GOSG) provides AF executive-level oversight, guidance, and direction of the program.
     AFPD 25-1, War Reserve Materiel, and AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel (WRM) Program Guid-
     ance and Procedures, and PMD 2054, Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR), are the author-
     itative directives for responsibilities incumbent in the respective groups. The Air Force War and
     Mobilization Plan (WMP), Vol. 1, provides the operational foundation for supporting the worldwide
     UCCs with BEAR resources. The Strategic Planning Guidance provides specific BEAR programming
     guidance. PMD 2054 (10) provides program direction for acquisition, replacement and sustainment of
     BEAR Systems and equipment.

7.11. BEAR Integrated Product Team (BIPT):
     7.11.1. The BIPT integrates and coordinates day-to-day BEAR management activities for the AF. It is
     the primary group for coordinating activities of functional communities in the multi-functional BEAR
     management process. The BIPT is the initial entry or gatekeeper for issues, ideas, concerns, etc., con-
     cerning the overall BEAR program. The BIPT prioritizes issues and presents those requiring further
     action to the BSRB.
     7.11.2. ACC/LGX is chartered by AFI 25-101 to organize and lead the multi-agency BIPT. ACC
     accomplishes these responsibilities pursuant to ACC Mission Directive 38-313. ACC/LGXW chairs
     the BIPT and is responsible for publishing implementing instructions for the BIPT.
     7.11.3. The BIPT manages and integrates issues related to BEAR to include system sustainment and
     equipment upgrades to increase AF BEAR capabilities. The BIPT acts as the BEAR Weapon System
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                   63


   Team (WST) within the Combat Air Forces (CAF) modernization process, and is responsible for plan-
   ning, programming, budgeting, directing, and assessing materiel solutions to identified BEAR system
   and equipment deficiencies. Sustainment and product improvement of BEAR Systems and equipment
   as directed by the BSRB, through the BIPT, is managed through the AFMC System Program Director
   at WR-ALC/LEB.
      7.11.3.1. Upgrading and sustaining BEAR capability is a multi-functional process involving
      numerous disciplines. As a result, establishing priorities for system upgrades may, at times, con-
      flict with individual functional desires. The collective goal of the BIPT is to ensure that BEAR
      system capabilities are improved, without regard to any one functional desire, to maximize total
      system capability within existing and programmed resources.
      7.11.3.2. The BIPT addresses, on behalf of the CAF, BEAR capabilities, upgrades, configuration
      control, UTC development, suggested enhancements, and other issues relative to BEAR support
      of Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) operations.
      7.11.3.3. All recommended changes to the BEAR System or stand-alone systems that require
      interface/support from the BEAR SPD (i.e., water, power generation and distribution) must be
      coordinated through the BEAR SPD under the Single Manager. The SPD is responsible for the
      assurance of Operational, Safety, Suitability, & Effectiveness of the BEAR System. SPD person-
      nel along with the submitting organization will perform required research and provide a recom-
      mendation to the BIPT based on impact(s) to the system. The BIPT will approve, recommend
      approval to BRSB, or return for additional research any recommended BEAR Systems changes.
   7.11.4. The BIPT meets formally in the spring of each year, which all BIPT members attend. Issues
   needing to be addressed out-of-cycle will be coordinated electronically or by special meetings at the
   chairperson’s discretion. Issues affecting or requiring limited functional involvement for resolution
   will be coordinated electronically or through meetings with affected functional members. The BIPT
   chair may call meetings to address other BIPT issues more frequently if required. In all cases however,
   decisions will be promulgated to all BIPT members for their information.
      7.11.4.1. BIPT decisions are undertaken by simple majority vote of principal members in atten-
      dance or responding to an electronic vote request.
          7.11.4.1.1. When a principal BIPT member non-concurs with a BIPT decision, they can for-
          mally request that the BIPT chair forward the issue to the BSRB for final consideration. These
          requests are documented in the BIPT minutes.
          7.11.4.1.2. When a BSRB principal member non-concurs with a BIPT decision and so
          requests, the BIPT chair will forward the decision and non-concurrence to the BSRB chair for
          inclusion on the BSRB agenda for further consideration. These requests are documented in
          BSRB minutes.
          7.11.4.1.3. When circumstances warrant, reclama issues may be coordinated electronically or
          by special meetings at the BSRB chairperson’s discretion.

7.12. BEAR Systems Readiness Board (BSRB):
   7.12.1. The BSRB is the O-6 level management group that directs and oversees the AF BEAR Pro-
   gram. ACC/LGX chairs the BSRB. The BSRB will meet at least annually, generally in May. If
   deemed necessary, the BSRB chair may call for special out-of-cycle meetings to resolve or discuss
64                                                                             AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


     issues. When situations require, BSRB issues may be addressed and coordinated electronically. The
     predominant means of input to the BSRB is through the BIPT.
        7.12.1.1. The BSRB tasks the BIPT for recommendations or further study as required. When nec-
        essary, the BSRB will establish subordinate working groups to resolve specific issues.
        7.12.1.2. The BSRB forwards unresolved issues to the BEAR General Officer Steering Group
        (GOSG) for resolution (see 7.12.1.5.4.).
        7.12.1.3. BSRB decisions are undertaken by simple majority vote of principal members in atten-
        dance or responding to an electronic vote request.
        7.12.1.4. Decision issues in the following areas require mandatory review and approval by the
        BSRB:
            7.12.1.4.1. Strategic positioning or repositioning of BEAR Systems.
            7.12.1.4.2. Increases or decreases to overall AF BEAR inventory objectives.
            7.12.1.4.3. Funding of BEAR programs to include Appropriation 3080, 3400, and any related
            3600 activities undertaken by Civil Engineer or other functional agencies on behalf of the
            BSRB.
        7.12.1.5. Decisions are promulgated, subject to review, and reclama as follows:
            7.12.1.5.1. The BIPT formally transmits decisions from annual and special meetings to all
            members via published meeting minutes. BIPT members have 30 days from the issuance of
            these minutes to brief and coordinate with their leadership on the decisions and any non-con-
            currence. Principal BSRB members, within this 30-day reclama window, may formally request
            any decision or issue with which there is disagreement be reconsidered at the BSRB’s next
            scheduled meeting. If there is no notification of disagreement, the BIPT decisions stand as
            written. During the 30-day reclama, period BSRB principal members may also revoke any
            non-concurrence registered by their BIPT member.
            7.12.1.5.2. When a BSRB principal member non-concurs with a BIPT decision and so
            requests, the BIPT chair will forward the decision and non-concurrence to the BSRB chair for
            inclusion on the BSRB agenda for further consideration. These requests are documented in
            BSRB minutes.
            7.12.1.5.3. When circumstances warrant, reclama issues may be coordinated electronically or
            by special meetings at the BSRB chair’s discretion.
            7.12.1.5.4. BEAR General Officer Steering Group (GOSG). The BEAR GOSG is the Air

         WAR CONSUMABLE DISTRIBUTION OBJECTIVE (WCDO) PROCEDURES

8.1. Purpose: The WCDO document is the USAF’s approved means to pre-position war consumables
at or near the Planned Operating Bases (POB) in support of USAF aviation forces documented in the HQ
USAF War Mobilization Plan, Volume 4 (WMP-4). It also provides war consumables in support of
in-place and deployed ground support equipment.
   8.1.1. The WCDO document mirrors the WMP-4 wartime planned lines of activity and provides
   WRM consumable requirements. The WCDO is a deliberate planning document that identifies “Worst
   Case” OPLAN, CONPLAN, and/or Plan Set requirements. LOGFAC is the Air Force system serving
   as the WMP-4 database and is used to compute WCDO consumables requirements, except munitions.
   The WCDO is produced and distributed to the host installation WRMO/NCO annually, as a minimum.
   Munitions pre-positioning requirements are derived through the NCAA process. NCAA theater allo-
   cations form the basis for WCDO preparation. In commands without OPLANs and tasked to store
   swing locks, allocation objectives serve the sample purpose as a WCDO.

8.2. Overview: HQ USAF/XOXW produces the WMP-3, Part 1, to apportion Combat Forces to Air
Component Commands. These Combat Forces are then documented in the WMP-4 by the Air Component
Operational Command Planner. Each line of activity is unique. If the USAF does not apportion your unit
in the WMP-3, you will not be tasked in the WMP-4. AMC strategic airlift and tanker lines of activity are
produced by Joint Flow and Analysis System for Transportation (JFAST) as part of the AMC WMP-4.
The WMP-4 build process is outlined in Figure 8.1.
   8.2.1. The WMP-4 consists of 4 parts. These are:
       8.2.1.1. Wartime Aircraft Activity (WAA). USAF wartime aircraft lines of activity are identified
       by a unique line number in the WMP-4.
       8.2.1.2. Missiles. Air-to-air missiles are apportioned in the Tactical Air Missile Program (TAMP).
       Type M records.
       8.2.1.3. Rations. Meals Ready to Eat. Type R records.
       8.2.1.4. Special Items. Base support items, such as runway foam. Type S records.
   8.2.2. The WCDO is produced as follows:
       8.2.2.1. Non-munitions day-by-day requirements. Identifies the day-by-day non-munitions con-
       sumable requirements to support WMP-4 sorties by POB, Plan (ALL PLANS), MDS and Unit.
       8.2.2.2. Non-munitions Accumulative Totals. Identifies the total POB non-munitions consumable
       requirements by NSN, the most stringent Plan quantity/Starter quantity/Swing quantity/Allocated
       quantity.
       8.2.2.3. Munitions day-by-day requirements. Identifies the day-by-day munitions consumable
       requirements to support WMP-4 sorties by POB, Plan (ALL PLANS), MDS and Unit.
       8.2.2.4. Munitions Accumulative Totals. Identifies the total POB munitions consumable require-
       ments by NSN, the most stringent Plan Quantity/Starter Quantity/Swing Quantity/Cat F Quantity/
       Cat G Quantity/Requirement Quantity.

      Cross Reference Data—Collection of data files updated as follows:
      OPLAN Warning Time Data—The WMP-1, Annex E identifies the number of Starter days
      authorized for pre-positioning assets. The Command planner can override these days using the
      EXCEPTIONS field in the WARN module and/or the Item Identification Detail module. Excep-
      tions in the WARN file are used to decrease the number of starter days required for pre-positioning
      stock. Exceptions in the Item Identification table are used to decrease the number of starter days
      required for a specific commodity by group code (01-Tanks), family code (X-POL), or DODIC
      (250X-Deicing). The exception date cannot be higher than the WARN days or Exception days,
      when there is one, in the WARN table.
      Aircraft Planning Factor Data—Interface with WMP-5. This data is dynamic and can be spe-
      cific to the Command and MDS. Provides by fiscal year, aircraft category, MDS and role, the fuel
      type, fuel gallons per hour, fuel reserve time and the reserve quantity.
      Number of Sorties Allocated Data—Provides the sorties allocated by MAJCOM.
      Aircraft Oil / Fuel Tank Data—Provides the Oil DODIC, Oil Factor, and tank capacity by MDS.
      This file is primarily a static table.
      Item Identification Data—Detailed information of each DODIC. Provides the NSN, nomencla-
      ture, unit of issue, quantity unit pack, weight, cube, cost, and source of supply as related to an Item
      Identity Code (IIC) Department of Defense Item Code (DODIC), group code or a family group (W

      nent Commands required to develop Oplans/CONPLANs. This data is updated in LOGFAC quar-
      terly or as requested.
      WMP4-C—Final copy of the Command WMP4. Cannot be updated from this point.
      WMP4-AW—Consolidation of all WMP4-C’s. This is a working copy for the AF Executive Ops
      Manager to make final updates if necessary.
      WMP4-A—Final approved WMP-4 used for deliberate planning and to produce the WCDO. This
      file cannot be updated from this point.

8.3. Wartime Aircraft Activity Report (WAAR), (RCS: HAF-XOX (A&AR) 9001):
   8.3.1. The WAAR extract for each base provides an overview of all US Air Force approved wartime
   aircraft activity documented for that installation in support of current war plans. The WAA provides
   unit planners visibility of specific deployment/employment activity for all Commands.
   8.3.2. Information contained in the WAA is classified by the USAF WMP-4. Each line of activity in
   the WMP-4 contains the security classification of that line. The WMP-4 extract for a single base will
   be classified in accordance with the line of activity having the highest classification. The WAA extract
   contains information affecting the National Defense of the United States within the meaning of Espi-
   onage Laws, Title 18, U.S.C., Sections 793 and 794.
   8.3.3. Specific OPLAN/CONPLAN and the WAA extract should be used to evaluate the logistics
   resources available at an installation to support all taskings upon Plan implementation. Based upon
   results of the evaluation, the unit is responsible for ensuring, to the maximum extent possible, that
   adequate resources are available to support documented wartime activity. Commanders will make
   every effort to ensure approved levels of support are requisitioned, stored, and maintained ready for
   use. Any support deficiencies beyond unit capability to resolve must be identified through appropriate
   intermediate headquarters to the applicable MAJCOM for staff assistance or action as appropriate.
   This evaluation process should include but is not limited to:
      8.3.3.1. An analysis of built-up tanks and RAP requirements to satisfy initial wartime sorties (if
      tanks and RAP are authorized on the WCDO). The built-up tanks and RAP objective (assets in
      ready-to-use status) should be determined based on a projected daily consumption rate of each
      type tank and RAP and the unit’s build-up capability (consider in-place and wartime augmentation
      capability). Daily wartime expenditure rates can be estimated by dividing the total authorized (of
      each tanks and RAP item) by the number of days authorized to be pre-positioned.
      8.3.3.2. A survey of appropriate military and commercial sources of consumables such as LOX,
      deicing, and gaseous oxygen for support of documented wartime activity.
74                                                                                 AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


        8.3.3.3. Development of an aircraft parking plan to allocate available airfield ramp space to
        accommodate the maximum number of tactical and support aircraft programmed to be on the
        ground during any one-time period. Planning should consider airfield schedules to allow for both
        in-place and any additive aircraft.
        8.3.3.4. Analysis of equipment capability provided by in-place base support resources, WRM sta-
        tion sets and additive force mobility packages to service and turnaround all aircraft identified in
        the unit’s WAA extract.
        8.3.3.5. Analysis of aircraft refueling capability based upon available refueling vehicles and
        hydrant systems.
        8.3.3.6. Other planning factors unique to specific locations, which could impact execution of unit
        wartime taskings.
     8.3.4. Currency of WAA Data. The WAA extract is a projection of planned activity for support of all
     OPlans. Ideally, information published in the WAA should reflect activity for the most recent OPLAN
     edition. However, since all OPLAN/CONPLAN (with TPFDD) are not updated at the same time and
     the WAA is prepared on an annual cycle with updates at the discretion of individual Commands, the
     document represents a "snapshot" at the time Command data is prepared. No attempt should be made
     to match specific plan deployment tasking to airlift sorties in the document. Airlift sorties reflected in
     the WAA are predicated on the JCS-approved version of the plan existing at the time of preparation.
     The airlift sorties depicted do not necessarily consider the latest plan versions or revisions but are rep-
     resentative of overall airlift support requirements and are identified for programming activities and
     overall funding considerations. Airlift support planning is finalized at the time of OPLAN execution,
     at which time available airlift sorties would be dedicated on the basis of total movement requirements
     including unit and non-unit deployment priorities.
     8.3.5. Units undergoing aircraft MDS conversion will be provided a new WAAR when the HQ USAF
     WAAR, reflecting the new MDS, is approved and released at MAJCOM level. New documents cannot
     be produced based upon proposed or current conversions still in progress. A unit has to be officially
     identified as undergoing an MDS change before any changes are made to the WAAR.
     8.3.6. Inform CWRMO/NCO when unit possessed aircraft have changed MDS, for example F-16A/B
     to F-16C/D. Likewise, unknown aircraft system modifications may effect changes to the WAAR and
     WCDO and will cause problems if not properly documented. This is especially true if the consum-
     ables are no longer compatible with the new aircraft or system modification.
     8.3.7. Specific questions or comments relating to WAA should be addressed to the Command Opera-
     tions Planner or to AFMC/LGR for AFMC-related comments and questions. When addressing spe-
     cific WAA issues, indicate line number and Command code from the WAA Report.

8.4. War Consumables Distribution Objective (WCDO):
     8.4.1. The WCDO extract for each base identifies the USAF War Reserve Materiel pre-positioning/
     pre-stocking requirements at designated locations worldwide to support the wartime activities docu-
     mented in the USAF WMP-4. The WCDO is current on the day printed. It supports the USAF War and
     Mobilization Plan, Volume 4 (WMP-4), Wartime Aircraft Activity Report, and WMP-1, Annex E,
     Logistics.

   8.4.2. Security Instructions. Each page of the WCDO is classified by content. Detailed Security guid-
   ance is contained in Executive Order 12958. Ensure all documents are marked with proper security
   classification, reasons for classification, classified by, and downgrading instruction per EO 12958.
   8.4.3. This section provides WRMO/NCOs at all levels of command information for use in managing
   and interpreting WRM objectives/requirements and acquainting them with the concepts and terminol-
   ogy used in the WCDO. The WCDO build process is outlined in Figure 8.2.

   WMP4-A—Produced by the Executive Operational Manager (AF/XOXW). Final approved WMP-4
   used for deliberate planning and to produce the WCDO. This file cannot be updated from this point.
   OPLAN Warning Time Data—The WMP-1 identifies the number of Starter days authorized for
   pre-positioning assets. The Command planner can override these days using the EXCEPTIONS field
   in the WARN module and/or the Item Identification Detail module. Exceptions in the WARN file are
   used to decrease the number of starter days required for pre-positioning stock. Exceptions in the Item
   Identification table are used to decrease the number of starter days required for a specific commodity
   by group code (01-Tanks), family code (X-POL), or DODIC (250X-Deicing). The exception date can-
   not be higher than the WARN days or Exception days, when there is one, in the WARN table.

     Item Identification Data— Detailed information of each DODIC. Provides the NSN, nomenclature,
     unit of issue, quantity unit pack, weight, cube, cost, and source of supply as related to an Item Identity
     Code (IIC) Department of Defense Item Code (DODIC), group code or a family group (W = Muni-
     tions, X = POL, Y = TRAP, and Z = miscellaneous). Also contains alternate IIC’s, unit of issue con-
     versions, substitute NSNs and further breakdown of starter exception days by IIC.
     Aircraft Oil / Fuel Tank Data— Provides the Oil DODIC, Oil Factor, and tank capacity by MDS.
     This file is primarily a static table.
     War Consumable Factor Data—The WCDO build looks in this file to determine what consumables
     are needed and the factor to calculate the quantity to support each line of activity on the WAA by
     MDS and role. This file was updated by the Command Planner in the WMP-4C process.
     Base Cross Reference Data—This data is sourced from the JOPES GEOLOC file by an automated
     interface or updated by the Executive Manager (ACC/LGXW).
     PSEUDO Base Codes—Pulled from the PSEUDO table. This file is generated by the Executive Man-
     ager. The PSEUDO Base Codes when associated with an actual location or Base Code is classi-
     fied SECRET.
     End Item Priority of Build Data—This is the Complete Round Code (CRC) out of the Complete
     Round Dictionary maintained by OO-ALC/WMC at Hill AFB. This is an automated interface.
     WRM Consumable Assets Data—This is asset balances obtained from the SBSS, CAS and FAS sys-
     tems. It contains supply, fuels and munitions data.
     Requirement Data—These are assets required to support OPLAN taskings.
     WCDO Build—Ran by the MAJCOM Logistics Planner. This is only performed one time a year and
     should not be run again until a new WMP4-A is published. In the build process, the following data is
     pulled to “build” your report:
     WCDO Print—Produced by the Command Planner. WCDO print can be run as often as needed after
     the WCDO Build is complete. Inquiries are made to the following tables at the time of the print
     request.
     Missile Allocations—Pulled from the NCAA table.
     Exception Data—Pulled from the WARN table and/or the Item Identification table. The Command
     Planner updated this file in the WCDO process. This file determines how many starter days to calcu-
     late for starter stock on the WCDO when it is different from the WMP1.
     Non-Munitions Allocations—Data is fed into this table by the R18 transferred in by the units.

8.6. Installation WRMO/NCO will:
   8.6.1. Upon receipt of the WCDO, WAAR and the foreword, maintain and send a copy of the extracts
   to supply and munitions (when applicable). The WRMO/NCO and WRMMs must conduct an analysis
   to evaluate the resources needed at your installation based upon the current WAAR. The WCDO and
   the WAAR are distributed simultaneously and a review/validation of both documents must be con-
   ducted. The WRMO/NCO must provide a copy of the WCDO to the functional WRMM’s no later
   than seven days after receipt. Supply must update all WCDO detail records to reflect current authori-
   zations within 30 days.
   8.6.2. Scrutinize and review the WAAR by each line of activity, specifically the sorties, by role and
   pre-positioning code and compare the WCDO quantities required day-by-day with the sortie informa-
   tion obtained from the WAAR. Next, review the WCDO Munitions and Non-Munitions Accumulative
   Total page to determine the most stringent requirement for each item, supporting all AF wartime air-
   craft activity at the planned operating base. The most important phase of this evaluation is working
   with the WRMMs. Assemble the host operations, supply, munitions, fuels, services and civil engineer,
   and other WRMMs, as applicable, to review these documents. Jointly, determine if the WCDO con-
   sumable asset quantities appear reasonable based on the information/documentation provided.

8.7. Installation WRMMs will:
   8.7.1. The commodity WRMM is responsible for ensuring adequate resources are available to support
   wartime activities based upon the results of the evaluation. Receipt of your WCDO gives your unit the
80                                                                               AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


     authority to process supply detail record changes and initiate requisitioning action. The host installa-
     tion Commander is ultimately responsible for making every effort to ensure approved levels of sup-
     port are requisitioned, stored, and maintained ready for use. The new WCDO may reflect smaller or
     larger quantities and even contain different items. Requisition new items and increased quantities as
     funding permits. Consider alternate sources of supply. On-hand quantities greater than the new autho-
     rized quantities are excess. This evaluation and the information obtained provide the basis for your
     WRM Review Board. WRMM Functional Responsibilities are as follows:
        8.7.1.1. Operations plans subject matter expert: Reviews and validates the WAA for aircraft data,
        roles, sortie duration, munitions expenditures and types.
        8.7.1.2. Material Management Flight, Storage Element, and WRMM: Evaluates consumable
        quantities to determine if there is adequate storage, etc.
        8.7.1.3. Management and Systems Flight (Customer Service) WRMM: Reviews all detail num-
        bers prior to realigning the "W" details to agree with the new WCDO. There are exceptions for
        loading items on SBSS detail records (e.g., aviation fuel and rations). When loading WCDO
        requirements for non-munitions items, use activity code W, organization code 002, and shop code
        of “WR.”
        8.7.1.4. Fuels WRMM: Evaluates the daily fuel consumption rates and the total fuels requirement
        from the WCDO summary page to determine if the Bulk Petroleum War Reserve Stock (BPWRS)
        identified in the IMP adequately supports the WAA.
        8.7.1.5. Munitions WRMM (MASO): Evaluates munitions quantities to determine if there is ade-
        quate storage, etc. The WRMM is responsible for maintaining WRM munitions levels at current
        allocated quantities. The authorized quantity is listed under the requirement total for each item
        identification code (DODIC) listed. When loading WCDO requirements for munitions items use
        activity code W, organization code 002, and shop code of “WR.”
        8.7.1.6. Services WRMM: Evaluates MREs for self-sustaining units and air and missile crews.
        8.7.1.7. Other applicable organizations: Evaluate requirements for consumables.
     8.7.2. All needed changes to the WCDO will be forwarded from the WRMO/NCO to CWRMO/NCO.
     8.7.3. After all details are loaded, the installation WRMO/NCO will receive and validate reports (R07
     from supply).

8.8. Data Descriptions:
     8.8.1. Base Cross-Reference Data. Contains data elements necessary to identify a specific location
     and alternate locations as they relate to the POB. It also contains required information to interface
     related logistics systems for assets reported (i.e., equipment, consumables) for the actual locations.
     The geographical location code of the airfield runway should be entered as the prime location.
     8.8.2. PSEUDO Base Code Data. It is built from the base cross-reference with 12 pseudo codes
     assigned for each base cross-reference location. The base cross-reference file must be completely
     updated prior to building this file. This file assigns pseudo codes on the WCDO document to be uti-
     lized when loading the POB on the supply detail records. When WCDO assets are stored at alternate
     storage locations, the MAJCOM WRMO should provide the pseudo code of the ASL to the base
     WRMO for loading the ASL on the supply record.
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                       81


  8.8.3. Item Identification Data. Contains data elements that relate the WIC, DoDIC, and Item Identity
  Code (IIC) to the National Stock Number and other indicative data such as nomenclature, weight,
  cube, cost and pre-positioning exception days by geographical location code/logistical area/sub-area.
  The prime WIC, DoDIC, and IIC are contained in-group codes 1-33 while the substitute components/
  end items are in the double asterisk file (**).
  8.8.4. War Consumable Factor Data. Contains expenditure-per-sortie factors (EPSF) required to com-
  pute war consumables as they relate to a specific unit, GEOLOC, MAJCOM, Role MDS and or logis-
  tical sub area. The WCDO is built by multiplying the EPSFs by the sorties outlined in the USAF
  WMP-4. To ensure war consumables objectives are computed, as a minimum, EPSFs must be entered
  in the war consumable factors file for a logistical area, MAJCOM, MDS, and Role.
  8.8.5. Aircraft Planning Factor Data. Contains WMP-5 planning factors (e.g., sortie rates, duration,
  and attrition). Attrition rates are based on the WMP-5. All aircraft assigned by the correct MDS
  (F015AB, not F015A) wartime utilization role must be entered in order to update the Command
  WMP-4 and the war consumable factors.
  8.8.6. Aircraft Oil/Fuel Tank Data. Contains data elements required to compute WCDO fuel and oil
  pre-positioning objectives quantities. Identifies each aircraft’s characteristics for internal, external and
  reserve capacities. It also identifies type and size of external fuel tank by MDS.
  8.8.7. End Item and Priority of Build Data. Contains indicative data for munitions complete item/
  round build.

8.9. WCDO Commodity Guidance:
  8.9.1. Missiles. Missiles identified in the WCDO represent the quantity required to support approved
  OPLAN/CONPLAN with TPFDD. HQ USAF/XORW allocates available stocks (including produc-
  tion deliveries) to the Commands, and then individual base allocations are made by the respective
  Commands. It is of importance to note that of the WRM missiles allocated to a base, some of these
  assets may be Tactical Air Delivery (TAD) assets. Questions concerning the requirement should be
  addressed through respective Commands to HQ USAF/XORW. Bases will not requisition missiles
  and Mission Oriented Items (MOI) since these assets are automatically allocated and distributed by
  MAJCOM.
  8.9.2. Munitions Items (bombs, cartridges, missiles, flares, pyrotechnic chaff). Munitions are com-
  puted using the factors in the EPSF data. The quantities shown for each base are determined by the
  activity at that base on the WAAR and EPSF file. WRM consumable authorizations, requirements and
  starter/swing objectives are identified on the WCDO. Initial loads will be provided either at the home
  base or pre-stocked at a forward base, as determined by the Air Component Command concerned.
  Fighter, special operations and rescue aircraft are authorized a basic load of ammunition, chaff, and
  flares for a unit move (UMV) role. Bombers are authorized a basic load of bombs, air-to-ground
  munitions, chaff, and flares. Other aircraft are authorized a basic load of chaff and flares as applicable.
  It is important to note that of the WRM munitions allocated to a base, some of these assets may be
  Forward Presence assets and/or Rapid Response Swing Stock (RRSS) assets.
  8.9.3. Munitions Shelf Life. Munitions items must not be stored longer than their established shelf life
  limits. This is especially important for aircrew escape system in FSC 1377 where shelf life expiration
  can endanger crews or cause aircraft grounding. If use rates will not prevent shelf life expiration for
82                                                                               AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


     on-hand stocks, notify respective parent Commands for action. Commands will advise OO-ALC/
     LIWB of shelf life expiration and ask for replacement 730 days before shelf or service life expiration.
     8.9.4. Chaff. Chaff is managed and stored within the munitions storage area (MSA). Only explosive
     activated chaff is required to be stored in the MSA. Chaff and Flare modules (dispensers) are managed
     within base supply. All requirements for base-supply managed items are obtained through requisi-
     tions, which must be coded to indicate use, i.e., training or WRM. MSA managed chaff is requisi-
     tioned in the quantities indicated in the WCDO.
     8.9.5. Fuel (Avfuel). The Inventory Management Plan (IMP) is the implementing document for
     pre-positioning of bulk fuel quantities. When Major Commands are tasked to develop Bulk Petroleum
     War Reserve Requirements (BPWRR) for the theater Unified Combatant Commander and Defense
     Energy Support Center, use the most current WMP-4 AMC data or the Integrated Consumable Item
     Support (ICIS) module to complete computations. Use of any other source document to compute
     BPWRR is prohibited. Computations should not include Civil Reserve Air Fleet requirements at com-
     mercial airfields. Joint use airports will be included; however, fuel will not be stocked at these loca-
     tions. Quantities identified on WCDO represent “requirements” to support specific activities as
     documented in the WAAR (WMP-4) and are provided for informational purposes only. The quantity
     reflected in WCDO should be supportable within the total authorizations. The Base Fuels Manage-
     ment Flight should be consulted to determine adequacy of support.
     8.9.6. Oil (Avfuel). Oil objectives are based on engine technical orders peacetime planning factors.
     Oil is computed based on quantity fuel consumption oil factor (quantity required per gallon of fuel
     burned) indicated in the WAAR.
     8.9.7. De-icing Fluid. This commodity is normally pre-positioned in bulk or 55-gallon drum quanti-
     ties depending on location and storage capabilities. The National Stock Number for bulk with a unit of
     issue of gallon (GL) is used in the WCDO. If the WCDO quantity is equal to or greater than one-half
     the quantity required to de-ice one aircraft, the authorization is increased to the quantity required to
     de-ice one whole aircraft. If the WCDO quantity is less than one-half the quantity required to de-ice
     one aircraft, the requirements are deleted.
     8.9.8. Gaseous Oxygen (280X). WCDO authorizations provide no allowance to maintain cylinder
     pressure (reference TO 42B5-1-2, Use, Handling and Maintenance Instructions--Storage Type Gas
     Cylinders). Pre-stock only quantities that cannot be furnished by the supply source in emergencies.
     8.9.9. Liquid Oxygen (290X). LOX quantities are for planning purposes only to ascertain the ade-
     quacy of on-base production capability to meet WRM requirements. Where generating plants exist,
     total base requirements for wartime support, not just flightline demand, should be considered. No
     allowance has been made for losses due to natural boil off. Pre-position only quantities which cannot
     be furnished by the supply source in emergencies.
     8.9.10. Argon Gas (255X). The Base Fuels Management Flight, IAW AFM 23-110, Vol I, Part Three,
     Chapter 4, manages WRM requirements for this item.
     8.9.11. Liquid Nitrogen (270X). Liquid nitrogen is pre-positioned for use in both liquid and gaseous
     form. Pre-positioning of liquid nitrogen for gaseous nitrogen servicing requirements should be accom-
     plished only if local capability includes liquid to gaseous conversion/servicing units. Address ques-
     tions regarding requisitioning of this commodity to MAJCOM.
AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005                                                                                 83


   8.9.12. Film/Chemical. WCDO identification of film and chemical requirements is standardized
   whenever possible to ensure compatibility between overseas and CONUS operating locations. Pri-
   mary operating stock (POS) preference is not a primary consideration and will not be considered as
   justification for WCDO change. Although suitable substitutes on hand in POS may be used as neces-
   sary to satisfy the WRM requirement at the time of deployment, pre-positioned quantities at wartime
   locations are based on prime item identification from the WCDO. Deploying units can anticipate hav-
   ing to make some adjustments to processing techniques depending on specific film and chemical com-
   binations pre-positioned. Any “incompatibility” between specific items pre-positioned and cameras/
   weapon systems to be employed should be identified by specific technical order reference to MAJ-
   COM Intelligence. If normal operational levels meet the gross wartime requirements, no acquisition is
   needed. Acquisition and retention should be made on specific items that are compatible with camera
   configuration installed on aircraft.
   8.9.13. Firefighting Agent. NSNs reflected are for planning purposes only. Actual storage will be
   based on local fire department criteria.
   8.9.14. Airborne weapons (Guns, Gun Barrels and Spare Parts). Guns and gun barrels requirements
   are computed on the basis of factors in the EPSF file.

Terms
Air Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP)—A program under which civilian contractors/
commercially available resources can be used to fill critical base operating support functions/asset
requirements that occur during a wide range of contingency, crisis, and wartime operations. AFCAP uses
civilian contractual assistance during peacetime to locate and plan for the acquisition of worldwide
commercial resources (personnel and materiel) assets to meet AF wartime support requirements.
Allowance Standard (AS)—Those items of equipment and supplies, not related to direct repair, required
for initial setup and operation of a function as specified in the mission capability state-ment. These items
will be authorized in war reserve materiel allowance standards, included in the War Plans Additive
Requirements Report, accounted for on equipment authorization in-use details, and must be in sufficient
quantity to sustain that function for a period of 60 calendar days. Examples include vehicles, tents, cots,
and tools. WRM AS include: 143, 154, 156, 158, 159, 927, 928, and 929.

highest Command or headquarters responsible for coordinating the planning will specify the exact
meaning of C-Day within the aforementioned definition. The Command or headquarters directly
responsible for the execution of the operation, if other than the one coordinating the planning, will do so
in light of the meaning specified by the highest Command or headquarters coordinating the planning. See
Joint Pub 1-02.
Command Overflow—The temporary storage of consumables (Air Force Materiel Command centrally
procured, on hand or funded commodities) computed to support sorties identified in the WMP-4 and

requirements and levels. PWRR requirements are based on USAF approved war mission (WMP-4) as
reflected in the War Consumables Distribution Objective (WCDO) document. NOTE: one barrel equals
42 US gallons.
Inviolate—Those War Reserve Materiel items earmarked solely for use in the conduct of a Major Combat
Operations (MCO). Use of inviolate items for other than MCOs support requires HQ USAF/ILGM
approval.
Item Identity Code—A four-position alphanumeric code assigned to identify the representative item.
Codes for munitions items start with an alphabetic character, and are the same as their Department of
Defense Identification Code (DoDIC). All other items start with a numeric value and end with an
alphabetic character that indicates the commodity type: W-tanks, Y-chaff, Z-guns, Q-Petroleum, Oil, and
Lubricants, and X-films and miscellaneous.
Joint Use Equipment—Equipment authorized to support a peacetime function that ceases to exist in
wartime allowing the equipment to satisfy a wartime requirement. Joint use equipment can be used to
satisfy WRM requirements vice ordering new equipment. All POS assets (not just vehicles) are to be
considered for joint use application to wartime requirements by the unit WRMPM.
Level of Effort-Oriented Items—WRM consumable items with requirements computation based on
such factors as equipment and personnel density and time and rate of use. For munitions, this is the
methodology used to compute requirements when the number of delivery vehicles constrains the amount
of weapons that can be expended. (See Joint Pub 1-02).
M-Day—The term used to designate the unnamed day on which full mobilization commences or is due to
commence (Joint Pub 1-02).
Mission-Oriented Items—Items for which requirements computations are based on the assessment of
enemy capabilities expressed as a known or estimated quantity of total targets to be destroyed. (Joint Pub
1-02)
Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP)—Support MRSP assets are designed to make the end
item functional, i.e., cables for a Secondary Distribution Center (SDC). Spares MRSP are assets designed
to repair end items in the field for up to 30 days until resupply can be established.
Non-US Air Force Airfield—Any airfield used by the US Air Force and Air Reserve Components in
peacetime or planned to be used in wartime that is under the peacetime jurisdiction of another Military
Service or civil authority.
Other War Reserve Materiel (OWRM)—Consumable and reparable items required to sustain forces
after the RSP support period.
P-Day—That point in time at which the rate of production of an item available for military consumption
equals the rate at which the item is required by the Armed Forces (Joint Pub 1-02).
Pre-position Code (Prep Code)—A two-character alpha code used in the WMP-4/WAA to show the
required pre-positioning or pre-stockade action for war consumables. First character codes are:
C – Consumables
D – De-icing
F – Fuels

PSEUDO Base Code—A four digit alphanumeric code assigned in the WCDO Report process to
facilitate automated WRM reporting. This code must be loaded in the "W" type detail records as the
Planned Operating Base/Alternate Storage Location. This code, when referenced to the actual Planned
Operating Base Code/Name for which the WRM requirement is authorized, is classified SECRET.
Pseudo-codes are maintained and controlled by ACC/LGXW.
Ration—Food necessary to feed one person per day.

condition and location of these assets at any point in time does not affect this quantity. When total current
war reserve materiel requirement for an investment spare exceeds the war reserve materiel supportable
quantity, the supportable quantity is allocated among the various schedules prepared by Headquarters, Air
Force Materiel Command according to Air Force policy. For budget code 9 items, the requirements are
considered supportable if the needed WRM stock fund obligation authority has been given to the unit with
the WRM authorization. Budget code 1 items are always considered supportable at the user level.
WRM Unsupportable Quantity—The differences between a unit’s requirement for an item and its war
reserve materiel (WRM) supportable quantity.

NOTES:
  1. Do not mark on the outside of a building or enclosed storage shed containing both WRM and
     non-WRM; instead, mark each WRM storage area inside the structure according to the table.
     2. Use only one placard. If there is more than one entrance on a given side of the building or shed,
        place near the center of the side with the multiple entrances.

      3. An example is a supply open storage area designated by warehouse location(s)
      4. An example is a dispersed stack of AM-2 matting.
      5. Examples of open storage areas that may or may not be enclosed by a fence or wall are:
         a. A supply open storage area with designated warehouse location.
         b. A storage area for items such as Airfield Damage Repair (ADR) equipment.
         c. An area where vehicles are parked.
      6. Powered equipment is defined as any item, except a vehicle, powered by a diesel or gasoline
         driven engine. Examples include: Powered AGE, ground power generators, water purification
         sets, laundry units, air compressors ADR and light sets ADR.
      7. A placard may be used if it is difficult to find a suitable position to affix a WRM triangle in a vis-
         ible location.
      8. One triangle will be on the side where the controls to operate the equipment are located. Recom-
         mend a second triangle be placed on the side left open for access by a forklift.
      9. Boxes, crates, canisters or drums need not be individually marked however; if circumstances war-
         rant marking, place a six to eight inch WRM triangle on two visible sides of the box or crate. (Do
         not place the triangle where it would be blocked from view) Mark canisters or drums with a six to
         eight inch WRM triangle on each of the round ends.
      10. If POS stocks of film are stored in the refrigerator, then do not mark. Instead mark each WRM
          location inside according to rule 18.
      11. If nets are boxed or crated see rule 8.
      12. Tank crates stacked together need not be marked. See rule eight for marking stacks.
      13. It may be necessary to mark some items with a placard due to the size or shape of the items.
      14. There are two options when marking ADR trailers.
             a. If the ADR trailer is marked on the outside, the WRM triangle will be six inches or eight
          inches and placed on each trailer door. All assets inside will be WRM, however, storage of
          non-WRM items can be accommodated provided that:
               (1) The non-WRM items are segregated in an area specifically for them.
               (2) The non-WRM items are placed in a storage container marked non-WRM.
             b. If the ADR trailer is not marked on the outside, mark each WRM item stored in the trailer
          with a WRM triangle, sign or placard using rules in 7, 16,18, or 19.
      15. Affix a locally fabricated placard to each vehicle designating the WRM base code. Make placards
          moveable and temporarily affix to allow rotation of vehicles without re-stenciling (magnetic sign/
          placards may be used).
      16. Munitions are exempt from marking as WRM.

                              EXAMPLE SURVEILLANCE VISIT REPORT
MEMORANDUM FOR (UNIT VISITED)
FROM: 123 LRS/LGRR
SUBJECT: WRM Surveillance Visit to 123 CMS/MXX
1. A WRM surveillance visit was conducted on 10 Jun 2002, at 0800 in the Vehicle Management branch
of Logistics Readiness. The WRMO used the ACC Dir 90-2325, C&SRL to evaluate the Vehicle Manage-
ment branch WRM program.
2. Personnel accompanying the WRMO during the visit were:
          TSgt Pallet   LGRR WRM Manager
          SSgt Net      LGRV Vehicle Management
          SrA Strap     LGRR Installation Pallet and Net Manager
3. The following items were inspected:
   a. Appointment letters. The appointment letters were current and security clearances verified.
   b. WRM program directives. The WRMM had all the required WRM guidance required to perform
   WRMM duties for the Vehicle Management branch.
   c. WRM quantities. WPARR and WCDO (as applicable) quantities were on-hand with the following
   exception:
          (1) Vehicles (or EQUIPMENT): 463L AT Forklift, V033, is identified on the WPARR, but is not
          authorized on the VAL. LGRV is required to determine a local source of supply to fill the WRM
          requirement as required by AFI 25-101, 4.3.2. If the requirement cannot be sourced locally, LGRV
          will need to send a letter to the ACC/LGRV identifying the WRM shortfall. (Open Item)
Nomenclature Authorized         On Hand        Unserviceable         Short
Vehicles          12            11                    10             01
NOTE: (Break out vehicles by type)
          (2) A 100% inspection of WRM pallets and nets identified discrepancies between the CA/CRL
          and on-hand balances. Several pallets and nets required corrosion maintenance and should be
          scheduled with EMS for corrective maintenance. (Open Item)

   d. A Joint Use (JU) recall was initiated at 0915. All J-U coded vehicles were assembled within the
   required time and inspected for serviceability. No discrepancies were noted.
106                                                                              AFI25-101 2 MAY 2005


      e. All WRM assets on-hand were properly stored and marked. Maintenance records for WRM vehi-
      cles were properly documented.
      f. Six WRM vehicles had been used for indirect mission support requirements since last surveillance
      visit. Records were reviewed indicating that proper request, approval, and notification of reconstitu-
      tion for each event was completed.
      g. LGRV’s WRM financial plan and budget execution were reviewed. Documentation supported the
      use of WRM funds for inspection, maintenance, and purchase of parts for use coded D vehicles and
      organizational WRM pallet corrosion program.
4. Open discrepancies from last report:
         00-01 - Nets not stored properly. Observed that a rack was made but nets were not hung. By end
         of inspection all nets were hung. (Closed)
         00-02 - Dunnage too short on one stack of pallets. New tonnage was applied and discrepancy was
         fixed immediately. (Closed)
         00-03 - Vehicle 000000999T is being used and not approved/documented on vehicle log. (Vehicle
         observed being operated on base) In the future WRM Vehicle Manager will monitor keys to
         vehicles closer. (Open)
         00-07 - Vehicle 000666C dirty inside and out. Vehicle was cleaned on the spot. VCO was
         instructed on the requirement to maintain vehicle IAW TOs, clean and free of foreign matter.
         (Closed)
5. New/Repeat Discrepancies:
96-08 - Stair truck still being used without proper notification to this office. WRMPM and the Vehicle
Maintenance Manager have been notified IAW Paragraph 4.8.4. AFI 25-101, so proper action can take
place on items 95-01 and 95-02. (ECD: 12 Jun 01)
6. Other comments: Overall the WRM Manager has a good program, and is trying to comply with WRM
program management procedures, however, there are in-house management problems that need to be cor-
rected to ensure that this program is in full compliance.
7. Recommend appointed manager make every effort to accompany the WRMO/NCO on all inspections.
