Section A—: Quick Turn Procedures.

1. A Quick Turn (QT) inspection -is accomplished when time scheduled between flights is less
than 6 hours and when a Thru-flight inspection is not required as defined in T. O. 00-20-1.
   1.1. As a minimum, the Aircraft Maintenance Unit (AMU) will be afforded three (3) hours
   to return the aircraft to crew ready status on all QTs. The three (3) hours to return the aircraft
   to crew ready status is computed from the time the flight crew departs the aircraft.
   1.2. The aircraft forms binder will remain at the aircraft during the QT.
 2                                                           552ACWI10-401 30 AUGUST 2013


     1.3. If the Operations Squadron wants to QT the aircraft (in less than three (3) hours), the
     pilot or flight engineer of the originating flight must resume the next sortie or stay at the
     aircraft to give turnover to the new flight crew.
        1.3.1. If a Thru-Flight is required the AMU will be afforded six (6) hours to return the
        aircraft to crew ready status.
     1.4. Mission planners should not schedule subsequent takeoff sooner than 4.5 hours after the
     first sorties land time. Additionally, the aircrews will only show to the aircraft after it has
     been called crew ready by the AMU Production Superintendent.
     1.5. The flightline maintenance expediter will coordinate fuel requirements through the
     Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) utilizing the proper fuel request priority.

Section B—: Quick Turn Responsibilities.

2. Operations Support Squadron will:
     2.1. Ensure flying schedule is strictly adhered to, making sure the first sortie lands no later
     than the scheduled landing time.
     2.2. Requests to extend the scheduled landing time or delay the subsequent takeoff time
     must be coordinated through the 552d Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (552 AMXS)
     Maintenance Operations Officer or designated representative and the 552d Operations Group
     Commander or designated representative.
3. The aircrew will:
     3.1. Relay landing time and aircraft maintenance codes to the 552 ACW/CP, no later than
     30-minutes prior to landing. 552 ACW/CP will relay aircraft landing time and codes to
     MOC.
     3.2. Keep any aircraft engine running with a maintenance discrepancy that maintenance
     specialists can troubleshoot prior to shutdown to expedite maintenance debriefing.
     3.3. Brief the maintenance recovery team supervisor on all maintenance discrepancies.
     3.4. Prior to departing the aircraft, document all required AFTO Forms 781,
     Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document, (e.g. AFTO 781, 781A, 781H, 781J).
     3.5. Proceed immediately to the AMU’s debriefing section with the in-flight discrepancies
     for a formal debrief of the aircraft.
4. AMXS will:
     4.1. Ensure adequate blank AFTO Form 781A’s are provided in the aircraft’s forms binder
     prior to the first sortie of the day whenever the aircraft is scheduled for a QT. This is to
     facilitate a quicker maintenance status briefing at the aircraft during the QT recovery.
     4.2. Ensure maintenance specialists meet the aircraft before engine shutdown to expedite
     debriefing and troubleshoot systems of engine related discrepancies.
     4.3. Ensure all mission-limiting discrepancies are troubleshot and repaired expeditiously.
552ACWI10-401 30 AUGUST 2013                                                                  3


   4.4. If oil samples are taken, process paperwork to the OAP lab immediately. Mark samples
   urgent to alert lab for immediate processing. Document take-off time on DD Form 2026, Oil
   Analysis Request, in the remarks block.
   4.5. Ensure aircraft engines under specific JOAPs codes, are not flown until results of
   sample(s) are known AFI 21-101, CAFSUP 1, para 14.38. OAP codes are located in T.O. 33-
   1-37, apprendix A, Page A-1.
   4.6. Ensure aircraft engines under OAP code “D” are not operated until discrepancies are
   corrected and verified with the OAP lab IAW AFI 21-101, CAFSUP 1, para 14.38.

   expediter for updating the aircraft forms.

Section C—: Engine Running Crew Change Procedures.

6. Engine Running Crew Changes (ERCCs)- will be coordinated and published in the weekly
flying schedule.
   6.1. The Supervisor of Flying (SOF) will coordinate up/download                  of    crew
   member/passenger(s). Aircrew taxi-back checklist will be accomplished.
   6.2. Aircrew/Passenger up/download procedures: Left wing engines (#1 and #2) shutdown
   using normal engine shutdown procedures. Right wing engines (#3 and #4) will remain at
   idle throughout the process of uploading and downloading personnel.
   6.3. The aircrew will notify 552 ACW Command Post (552 ACW/CP) of maintenance
   status, fuel load, and VIP transportation requirements.
   6.4. A Parking location will be given to the 552 ACW/CP by the AMU flightline expediter.
   6.5. If an aircraft lands code three (3) for a system needed on the proficiency flight the
   ERCC will be canceled.
   6.6. If aircraft is code three (3) for a mission system(s), coordinate through 552 AMXS
   Maintenance Operations Officer or designated representative for a decision to continue or
   cancel the ERCC.
   6.7. ERCCs will not be planned when fuel service is required on the returning aircraft. If
   fuel is required, a new sortie number will be obtained and a QT will be required.
   6.8. If only a download of crewmember/passenger(s) is accomplished, the same mission
   number and AFTO Forms 781 will be used. The aircrew will enter a remark in the AFTO
   Form 781 listing the actual aircraft landing time to explain the differences in flight time
   versus total time. Reference AFI 11-401, Flight Management, Attachment 1, for definition
   of a sortie.
 4                                                          552ACWI10-401 30 AUGUST 2013


     6.9. If any individual who was not on the original flight is uploaded, a new sortie number
     and a new set of AFTO Forms 781 will be annotated.
     6.10. All ground crew and aircrew members will ensure loose items and equipment are
     properly stowed or secured to minimize Foreign Object Damage (FOD) potential.
