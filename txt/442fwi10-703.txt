1. General

1.1. The EWIR process reprograms Electronic Warfare (EW) systems rapidly and efficiently to
meet changing threats. The 442 FW systems affected are the Airborne Integrated Receiver
(ALR)-69 Radar Warning Receiver (RWR), the Airborne Integrated Transceiver (ALQ)-184
Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) Pod, the Airborne Integrated Dispenser (ALE)-47
Countermeasures Dispenser System (CMDS) and the ALQ-213 Countermeasures Set (CMS).
2                                                         442FWI10-703 13 FEBRUARY 2009


1.2. The Wing will be notified of EWIR actions through a PW for real world software changes
affecting combat aircraft or a SB to exercise all or part of the EWIR process. PW messages are
normally generated by a Reprogramming Center (RC), but a SB may be generated by any level
of the EWIR process from the RC to an event coordinator to exercise all or portions of the EWIR
process. Timeliness is a very critical element of EWIR, so the 442 FW goal is to have the first
system reprogrammed within two hours of 442d Electronic Combat Pilot (ECP) approval.

1.3. The primary event coordinator for all 442FW EWIR is the Wing ECP. The Wing ECP’s
office is 303 Fighter Squadron, Wing Weapons and Tactics. Alternate event coordinators are
designated by the Wing ECP. The event coordinator is authorized to coordinate directly with all
affected base organizations to facilitate an efficient and effective EWIR process. See
Attachment 2 for a phone contact list.

2. Responsibilities in Addition to Those Directed by AFI 10-703:

2.1. The 442FW ECP:

2.1.1. Is designated as the 442 EW point of contact.

2.1.2. Acts as the primary EWIR event coordinator.

2.1.3. Ensures that all organizations participating in EW reprogramming have access to the
Multi-Service Electronic Warfare Data Distribution System (MSEWDDS).

2.1.4. Ensures that all organizations participating in EW reprogramming have access to the
PACER WARE Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNET) notification
system: https://wwwmil.53wg.eglin.af.mil.

2.1.4.1. Selects Pacer Ware Database in the links section of the web page to register for an
account.

2.1.5. Maintains a list of alternate EWIR event coordinators and designates alternate(s).

2.1.6. Coordinates with Intel to brief all EWIR actions and ramifications to affected aircrews.

2.1.7. Works with associated Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS) Specialist flight personnel
to reprogram EW systems.

2.2. AMXS Specialist Flight:

2.2.1. Maintains a working Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) connection for
use in the EWIR process.

2.2.1.2. When deployed, uses either SIPRNET laptop or deployed assets to accomplish
connectivity.
442FWI10-703 13 FEBRUARY 2009                                                                  3


2.2.2. Ensures that at least three individuals in the Specialist Flight have current SIPRNET
access, and have accounts set up on the MSEWDDS system at Eglin AFB.

2.2.2.1. When deployed, ensures that sufficiently trained personnel are sent to support EWIR
operations.

2.2.3. Ensures that MSEWDDS accounts have the libraries enabled for the following weapons
systems: ALR-69, ALQ-184, ALE-47, ALQ-213, and PLM-4.

2.2.4. Maintains and/or has access to a secure telephone system (STU-III or STE).

2.2.4.1. When deployed, mobilize secure telephone assets for use in EWIR.

2.3. Maintenance Squadron ECM Pod Shop:

2.3.1. Maintains a working SIPRNET connection for use in the EWIR process and to use as a
backup to the Specialist Flight.

2.3.1.1. When deployed, uses either SIPRNET laptop or deployed assets to accomplish
connectivity.

2.3.2. Ensures that at least three individuals in the ECM Shop have current SIPRNET access, and
have accounts set up on the MSEWDDS system at Eglin AFB.

2.3.2.1. When deployed, ensures that sufficiently trained personnel are sent to support EWIR
operations.

2.3.3. Ensures that MSEWDDS accounts have the libraries enabled for the following weapons
systems: ALR-69, ALQ-184, ALE-47 and ALQ-213.

2.3.4. Maintains and/or has access to a STU-III or STE.

2.3.5. Helps the AMXS with reprogramming of EW systems when needed to accomplish the
mission.

3. EWIR Flow and Sequence of Events:

3.1. A EWIR event normally starts with the arrival of a SB or PW message through either the
Command Post and/or the PACER WARE notification system (NIPRNET). The Command Post
provides 24-hour coverage for message notification either through 442 FW personnel or Host
Base coverage. The Command Post will notify the Wing ECP, the Specialist Flight, and the
ECM Pod Shop (if applicable). In the event that the ECP is unavailable to take the message, an
alternate event coordinator shall assume those duties.

3.2. The normal flow of EWIR messages is as follows:
4                                                        442FWI10-703 13 FEBRUARY 2009


3.2.1. System Impact Message (SIM): EWIR message that describes parametric changes to
threats and details what effect the changes will have on a particular aircraft EW system.
Maintenance organizations should prepare to reprogram the identified EW systems by gathering
the required equipment and ensuring they have access to SIPRNET and the MSEWDDS.

3.2.2. Reprogramming Impact Message (RIM): EWIR message that normally follows a SIM that
details how the Reprogramming Center plans to compensate for the change in the threat and how
the reprogramming actions affect a particular EW system. A Time Compliance Technical Order
(TCTO) or Maintenance Instruction Message (MIM) may also arrive to provide detailed
reprogramming procedures for maintenance personnel. Maintenance organizations should
follow the procedures contained in the MIM (if applicable) and load the software identified in
the RIM, MIM, and TCTO into their reprogramming equipment.

3.2.3. Implementation Message: EWIR message providing authorization from higher
headquarters to reprogram the affected EW systems. However, maintenance organizations will
not reprogram aircraft and ECM pods without approval from the Wing ECP or alternate event
coordinator. The Wing ECP or alternate event coordinator will brief the 442d Operations Group
Commander (442 OG/CC) on the effect of the EWIR and determine the appropriate time to load
the affected EW system based on current real-time conditions. The 442 OG/CC approval will be
disseminated by the event coordinator.

3.3. The interval between messages can vary from a few hours during a SB exercise to several
months for a PW dealing with a routine software upgrade. Following the RIM, reprogramming
software will be available on the MSEWDDS.

3.4. The event coordinator will monitor the reprogramming process. All 442 FW EWIR
organizations will follow instructions given by the event coordinator and applicable EWIR
messages provided to them. Verbal instructions from the event coordinator are all that are
required to perform steps in the EWIR process.

3.5. Time permitting, the event coordinator will make an effort to provide a copy of the EWIR
messages to all 442 FW EWIR organizations. Both the AMXS Specialist flight and the ECM
Pod Shop, as a backup, should download a copy of the appropriate reprogramming software in
case of a system failure at either location.

3.6. The 442 FW EWIR process is designed to be flexible and survivable, and as such,
maintenance organizations will be prepared to aid other sections with their reprogramming
activity by providing extra equipment and personnel that are trained and compatible with the
affected EW system.

3.7. All units will compile their reprogramming times, pertinent actions and problems
encountered when reprogramming ceases and pass this information to the Wing ECP and/or
event coordinator as soon as possible. The event coordinator will inform Maintenance
Operations and Control (MOC) and/or the Ramp Supervisor of results and times.
442FWI10-703 13 FEBRUARY 2009                                                       5


3.8. The event coordinator will use the compiled data to generate the Unit Loading Message
(ULM). For a PW, the ULM should be generated when the readily available aircraft or ECM
pods are reprogrammed. A statement will be included in the ULM explaining why the remaining
units were not reprogrammed and when the reprogramming is projected to be complete. For a
SB, the ULM will be composed when the required number of systems is reprogrammed. The
event coordinator will inform the OG/CC and MOC when reprogramming is complete. (Sample
ULM message format can be found in AFI 10-703).
