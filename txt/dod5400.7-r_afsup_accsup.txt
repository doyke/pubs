DOD 5400.7-R_AF SUP, 24 June 2002, is supplemented as follows. Air Combat Command (ACC)
field activities may issue additional supplements to this publication. ACC field-level supplements should
be forwarded to HQ ACC/SCXP (FOIA) for review prior to issuance. This supplement does not apply to
Air National Guard (ANG) or Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units and members. Send recom-
mended changes to this publication via AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to
HQ ACC/SCXP, 180 Benedict Ave, Suite 210, Langley AFB VA 23665-1924.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision updates the HQ ACC FOIA office mailing address and adds denial authorities for the Air
Intelligence Agency (AIA) and the National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC). A bar (|) indicates revisions
to the previous edition.
1.4.5. (AF) The ACC Director of Communications and Information Systems; the ACC Deputy Director
of Communications and Information Systems; the AIA Assistant Director of Operations for Communica-
tions; and the Commander, NAIC, are designated as additional denial authorities for Air Combat Com-
mand.
1.5.3.6. (Added) (AF) Any FOIA request received directly by a unit will be handcarried promptly to the
FOIA office. HQ ACC staff will contact the Command FOIA office at extension 4-2265.
1.5.3.6.1. (Added) (AF) If the document is a derivative of multiple sources, the OPR that either prepared
the document or has custody of the majority of the records is responsible for obtaining the appropriate
OCR(s) review(s). For classified records, the Original Classification Authority (OCA) or the successor to
the OCA will perform a declassification review and remark all declassified or downgraded portions (para-
graphs, pages) with the appropriate markings.

1.5.3.6.2. (Added) (AF) OPRs will provide two copies of the requested records (a clean copy and a
redacted copy). Portions recommended for denial will be bracketed with a RED PENCIL. (DO NOT use
a red pen or black out the information). Additionally, OPRs will copy all two-sided documents to sin-
gle-side prior to marking the portions recommended for denial/partial denial.
1.5.3.7. (Added) (AF) Base Records Managers are the FOIA Managers. They are responsible for sending
denial/partial denial case files to HQ ACC/SCXP (FOIA) using sample memorandum at Attachment 2
(Added) of this supplement. Proposed denial packages will contain the original request and envelope; two
legible copies (a clean copy and a redacted copy) (pages of the redacted copy will be numbered in the bot-
tom right hand corner and will indicate the proposed redactions in RED pencil); the ACC Form 142, Free-
dom of Information Act Request for Records; the legal review; the DD Form 2086; a copy of the
memorandum notifying the requester of the referral; and any other appropriate processing documents.
1.5.3.7.1.1. (Added) (AF) Use ACC Form 142 for coordination. The Base FOIA Manager will complete
Section I. The OPR will complete Section II. JA will either complete Section III or attach a typed legal
review to the form. NOTE: If the records are maintained in a Privacy Act system of records, items 3g and
3g-1 of the form MUST be completed.
1.5.3.7.1.2. (Added) (AF) The FOIA office will coordinate with Air Force attorneys on recommendations
for release as well as denial of records. If all records are routinely releasable (i.e., telephone books), the
coordination may be verbal. In those instances, the FOIA manager will place a memo for record in the
case file indicating the name of the attorney who coordinated on the action and the date.
1.5.3.7.1.3. (Added) (AF) Disclosure authority for headquarters records is the Command Records Man-
ager and/or the Command FOIA Manager. Numbered air force, wing, and group commanders have
release authority for records under their responsibility. Individuals at these levels may delegate, in writ-
ing, disclosure authority to a lower echelon, to include the FOIA Manager. In these instances, a competent
authority (as a minimum a branch chief or acting branch chief) should sign the ACC Form 142.
1.5.3.7.1.6. (Added) (AF) Do not release any portions of the record if you are recommending a partial
denial. Forward the entire case to HQ ACC/SCXP (FOIA). If the request is for several unrelated docu-
ments, and one or more of the records can be released without affecting the denial authority's decision on
the remaining record(s), contact the command FOIA manager to discuss the interim release.
1.5.3.7.1.8. (Added) (AF) A FOIA POC should be appointed in organizations that process five or more
FOIA requests per quarter. POC should be trained on FOIA requirements not later than 30 days after
appointment.
1.5.3.7.1.11. (Added) (AF) All denial of fee waivers or disagreements over category determinations must
be coordinated with the Command FOIA office.
1.5.3.7.1.15. (Added) (AF) FOIA managers submit the annual FOIA report to HQ ACC/SCXP (FOIA) to
arrive by the 10th workday in October.
1.5.3.7.1.17. (Added) (AF) When providing an adverse determination, provide appeal rights to the
requester. Use the following wording, "If you interpret our response to be an adverse action, you may
appeal it to the Secretary of the Air Force through HQ ACC/SCXP (FOIA), 180 Benedict Ave, Suite 210,
Langley AFB VA 23665-1924, within 60 calendar days from the date of this memorandum. If no appeal
is received, or if the appeal is postmarked after the conclusion of the 60-day period, the appeal may be
considered closed. Include your reasons for reconsideration and attach a copy of this memorandum.
DOD5400.7-R_AFSUP_ACCSUP 11 FEBRUARY 2003                                                                  3


1.5.3.8. (Added) (AF) On appeals for "no records" response, the OPR will conduct a second search and
indicate that "a thorough second search was conducted and no records were located." If the records were
properly disposed of IAW AFMAN 37-139, the OPR will state so and provide the appropriate table and
rule used to maintain said records."
1.5.8.1. Allow the requester 30 days to respond to requests for clarification. If a response is not received
within that time, notify the requester that you consider the case closed.
3.2.1.6.2.2. (AF) When releasing list of names, military or civilian (after removing names of personnel
stationed overseas or those assigned to routinely deployable or sensitive units), advise the requester that
"DOD 4525.8-M_AF SUP 1, Official Mail Manual, prohibits delivery of unofficial mass mailings of 50
pieces or more from the same mailer on the same day. In addition, repeated mailings of less than that
amount to circumvent policy is also prohibited."
3.2.1.6.2.2.1. (Added) (AF) Each base FOIA manager will update the list of routinely deployable/sensi-
tive units by the 15th workday in January and July of each year. Forward the updated list to HQ ACC/
SCXP (FOIA) for consolidation. Include the PAS Code (i.e., MW1CFJMC), organization number and
name (i.e., 27 Fighter Squadron), and the organization kind (i.e., FTR).
5.1.1.2.2. (Added) (AF) FOIA managers log in tenant unit(s) requests, task the appropriate unit, and pre-
pare a response for the tenant unit commander's signature or his designee. Recommendations for denial
will be submitted to the tenant MAJCOM FOIA office using their guidance.
5.2.1.2. (Added) (AF) Transmittal memorandums for recommended denials referred to the command will
be signed by either the wing or group commander who owns the records or by the appropriate squadron
commander. This responsibility may not be further delegated.
5.2.8.1. If the non-government source does not respond within the 30 calendar days allowed, follow-up to
ensure receipt of the correspondence.
5.2.8.3. You must notify any non-government source when the decision is made to release proprietary
information over their objection. An individual equal or higher in rank to the denial authority (O-6) must
sign the memorandum. The submitter will be given 10 workdays to seek a restraining order.
6.1.5.2.2.1. Categorize attorneys and law firms for fee assessment purposes based on whom they repre-
sent. Categorize them as "all others" when they represent an individual and as a "commercial requester"
when they represent a company.
6.1.5.2.7. If a requester does not remit fees within 30 days, notify the requester that failure to remit fees
will result in being placed on the FOIA delinquent list for the command. Allow 30 additional days. If fees
are not remitted within that time, provide HQ ACC/SCXP (FOIA) with the name of the requester, the
name and address of the firm/company they represent, the amount due, the date the records were released,
and the base FOIA number.
6.2.1. Inform the requester that payment must be made by check or money order payable to "Defense
Accounting Office XXXX (4 digit fund cite). Transfer fees collected to the local Defense Accounting
Office using a DD Form 1131, Cash CollectionVoucher. Small amounts of funds must be deposited at
least weekly or when $100.00 is accumulated, whichever occurs first.
6.2.2.2. Computer search time for fees to be collected for records stored in a central processing unit
(mainframe) will be based on $5.02 per minute. This fee does not apply to personal computers.
