                                    FLAGS AND PLATES

Section 2A—Introduction

2.1. Purpose. This chapter prescribes policy for the display, disposition, and use of flags,
guidons, streamers, and automobile and aircraft plates. Only the flags, guidons, streamers, and
automobile and aircraft plates described in this chapter are authorized for use in the Air Force
and on Air Force installations.
2.2. Design. Design elements appear on both sides of flags and guidons with the image on the
opposite side appearing as a mirror image (letters and numerals read from left to right on both
sides).
2.3. Materials. Flags designed primarily for indoor and parade display will normally be made
of banner rayon or heavyweight nylon with rayon fringe. Those designed primarily for outdoor
display will be made of nylon-wool or heavyweight nylon without fringe. Older flags, made
exclusively of wool, should be used until no longer serviceable and then replaced with flags
made of newer synthetic materials.
2.4. Restrictions. The following limitations and prohibitions are applicable to flags, guidons
and streamers.
   2.4.1. Carrying of non-military organizational flags. United States military personnel in
   uniform or in civilian clothing, acting in an official capacity, will not carry flags of veterans
   groups or other non-military organizations; commanders may, however, authorize military
   personnel to carry state, territorial or national flags during military ceremonies. United States
   military personnel in uniform are authorized to carry all Department of Defense recognized
   flags.
   2.4.2. Unserviceable flags. Unserviceable flags will not be used as banners or for any other
   purpose. When a flag is no longer suitable for display, it will not be cast aside or used in any
   way that may be viewed as disrespectful. Unserviceable flags should be destroyed privately,
   preferably by burning, in a way that does not show irreverence or disrespect to the flag.
   2.4.3. Serviceable flags. Serviceable flags purchased with appropriated funds are not to be
   sold, loaned or donated to non-military persons or organizations. This restriction does not
   prohibit the presentation of flags to families upon the death of a military member at a funeral
   or other appropriate setting (consult with your comptroller and staff judge advocate).
2.5. Authorized flags and plates. Flags and plates are authorized for positions or individuals as
prescribed in this publication.
2.6. Design of Official Emblems. For flags of organizations authorized emblems, refer to
AFI84-105, Organizational Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry, for design, approval and
construction. This instruction covers use of flags on Air Force installations after they have been
approved and produced.

2.7. Flag Protocol. Title 4 United States Code establishes the rules for proper use and display
of, and patriotic customs to be shown to the flag of the United States. The flag of the United
States shall only be displayed on Air Force installations according to these rules and customs and
the below guidance.
   2.7.1. Members must show proper respect for the flag. Criminal penalties for desecration of
   the flag of the United States are outlined in Title 18 United States Code, section 700.
   2.7.2. Dependents or visitors to an Air Force installation are required to show due respect for
   the flag of the United States. Failure to do so renders them subject to exclusion from the
   installation.
   2.7.3. Representations of the flag displayed in a manner or fashion that would impair the
   mission or detract from good order, discipline or morale of Air Force members may be
   excluded from the installation by the commander, as may the persons displaying
   representations of the flag in such a manner.
   2.7.4. The flag of the United States will always be displayed or carried in ceremonies when
   any other flags are displayed or carried. The union of the flag and the flag itself, when in
   company with other flags, is always given the position of honor.
   2.7.5. Flag spreaders are not authorized for Air Force usage.
2.8. Sizes and Occasions for Display. Sizes, types and occasions for display of the flag of the
United States are as follows:
   2.8.1. U.S. Installation/Base Flag. This flag is lightweight nylon bunting material, 8 feet by
   17 feet and is only displayed in fair weather from an installation flagstaff. This is the typical
   flag used at Air Force installations.
   2.8.2. US All-purpose Flags. The all-purpose flag comes in two materials:
       2.8.2.1. A flag of lightweight nylon bunting material 5 feet by 9 feet 6 inches replaces
       the base flag during inclement weather. It is also used for outdoor display with flags of
       friendly nations in foreign dignitary arrival ceremonies.
       2.8.2.2. A flag of rayon bunting material 3 feet by 4 feet is used for outdoor display with
       flags of friendly foreign nations in arrival ceremonies or to indicate joint occupancy of a
       building by two or more countries. They are also commonly used as the flag presented at
       retirements.
   2.8.3. Ceremonial Flag. This flag is rayon or synthetic substitute material, 4 feet 4 inches by
   5 feet 6 inches, trimmed on three edges with yellow rayon fringe 2 inches wide.
   2.8.4. Organizational Flag. This flag is rayon or synthetic substitute material and is 3 feet by
   4 feet. It is trimmed on three edges with rayon fringe 2 inches wide.
   2.8.5. Interment Flag. This flag is 5 feet by 9 feet 6 inches of any approved material. The
   interment flag is authorized for deceased military personnel and for deceased veterans. To
   receive a flag, fill out VA Form 21-2008, Application for United States Flag for Burial
   Purposes, and take it to any VA Regional Office or U.S. Post Office. This is the size flag
   used to drape over a closed casket.
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                      11


   2.8.6. Retirement Flag. The flag may be either 3 feet by 4 feet or 3 feet by 5 feet. Members
   retiring from the Air Force are entitled to presentation of a United States flag. Base O&M
   funds are authorized for this purchase. For details, refer to AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance
   and Procedures.
   2.8.7. Automobile Flags. There are three sizes of this flag, each with specific uses.
       2.8.7.1. The 12-inch by 18-inch flag is trimmed on 3 sides with yellow fringe, 1 inches
       wide. It is displayed with the individual automobile flag of the President and Vice
       President of the United States.
       2.8.7.2. The 18-inch by 26-inch flag is trimmed on 3 sides with yellow fringe, 1 inches
       wide. It is displayed on government automobiles of individuals who are authorized
       positional colors.
       2.8.7.3. The 6-inch by 9-inch flag is without fringe. This flag is authorized for display on
       government automobiles of general officers and members of the Senior Executive
       Service.
   2.8.8. Garrison Flag. Made of approved materials, 20 feet by 38 feet. Flown on holidays and
   special occasions. Can be substituted with the installation flag.
2.9. Time and Occasions for Display. It is universal custom to display the flag only from
sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However, when a patriotic
effect is desired, the flag may be displayed 24 hours a day if properly illuminated during the
hours of darkness. All flags should be illuminated when displayed with the flag of the United
States.
   2.9.1. Each Air Force installation is authorized to fly one installation flag from reveille to
   retreat, normally on a flagstaff placed in front of the installation headquarters. Additional
   flagstaffs and flags are authorized adjacent to each dependent school on the installation.
   Written requests for exceptions to policy are sent to the appropriate MAJCOM vice
   commander for approval. Approval letter will be maintained by the installation protocol
   office.
       2.9.1.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) When the installation flag in front of the wing
       headquarters building is required to be raised and/or lowered, during duty hours 52 FW
       Protocol Office (52 FW/CCP) will complete these actions. After duty hours, direction
       will come from the 52 FW Commander (52FW/CC), 52 FW/CCP, and/or 52 FW
       Command Post (52FW/CP). 52d Security Forces Squadron (52 SFS) will subsequently
       be notified to raise and lower the flags. If the flags are lowered they must be stored at 52
       FW/CCP until such time as they may be raised again. If it is after duty hours or on the
       weekend the flags will be stored at the 52 SFS Law Enforcement (LE) desk until such
       time as 52 FW/CCP may receive them.
   2.9.2. The flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously.
   2.9.3. The flag should not be displayed on days when the weather is inclement, except when
   an all-weather flag is used.
   2.9.4. The flag should be displayed on all days, especially on New Year‘s Day, January 1;
   Inauguration Day, January 20; Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, third Monday in January;
   Lincoln‘s Birthday, February 12; Washington‘s Birthday, third Monday in February; Easter

   2.9.5. The flag should be displayed during school days in or near every schoolhouse.
2.10. Position and Manner of Display. The following rules will be observed:
   2.10.1. When carried in a procession with another flag or flags, the flag of the United States
   should be either on the marching right; that is, to the flag‘s own right (to the far right of all
   others), or, if there is a line of other flags, in front of the center line as in Figure 2.1 This is
   also correct when flags are displayed in a stationary position. Flags carried by troops are
   never at half-staff.

   2.10.2. The flag of the United States, when it is displayed with another flag against a wall
   from crossed staffs, should be on the right, the flag‘s own right (observer‘s left), and its staff
   should be in front of the staff of the other flag (Figure 2.2).

Figure 2.2. Flag of the United States Displayed and Another Flag Displayed with Crossed
Staffs.




   2.10.3. When the flag of the United States is displayed from a flagstaff with other flags, the
   following applies:
      2.10.3.1. When a number of flags are grouped and displayed from staffs radiating from a
      central point, and no foreign flags are in the display, the flag of the United States will be
      in the center and at the highest point of the group as shown in Figure 2.3

Figure 2.3. Flag of the United States Displayed with Other Flags Radiating from a Central
Point.




      2.10.3.2. When a number of flags are displayed from staffs set in a line, all staffs will be
      of the same height and same finial. The flag of the United States will be at the right, that
      is to the left of an observer facing the display (Figure 2.4). However, if no foreign
      national flags are involved in the display, the flag of the United States may be placed at
      the center of the line providing it is displayed at a higher level than the other flags in the
      display (Figure 2.5).

Figure 2.4. Flag of the United States Displayed in a Line with Other Flags at Equal Height.




Figure 2.5. Flag of the United States Displayed in a Line with Other Flags at Lower Level.




   2.10.4. When flags of states, cities, or localities, or pennants of societies are flown on the
   same halyard with the flag of the United States, the flag of the United States should always
   be at the peak. When the flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United States
   should be hoisted first and lowered last. No flag or pennant may be placed above the flag of
   the United States. The only exception is when the flag of the United States is flown at half-
   staff for an official observance, foreign national flags may be above the flag of the United
   States.
   2.10.5. When flags of two or more nations are displayed, they are to be flown from separate
   staffs of the same height. The flags should be of equal size. International usage prescribes
   the display of the flag of one nation equal to that of another nation in time of peace. The
   flags will be displayed in a line, alphabetically, using the English alphabet, with the flag of
   the United States at its own right (the observer‘s left). When in North Atlantic Treaty
   Organization (NATO) countries, NATO member country flags are displayed in French
   alphabetical order. Use and display of flags by Air Force in foreign countries is done by the
   Air Force commanders obtaining instructions from the office of the United States Defense
   Attaché. In the absence of such an office, contact the senior Air Force officer on duty in the
   foreign country concerned. The Defense Attaché or senior Air Force officer formulates
   standardized instructions in keeping with existing treaties and arrangements or practices
   otherwise agreeable to the host country. Inquiries relating to display of flags in foreign
   countries may be directed to Headquarters US Air Force, International Affairs Division (HQ
   USAF/CVAI).
       2.10.5.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Main Traffic Circle. The 52 FW displays
       four flags at the main gate traffic circle (the Friendship Circle). They are the U.S. Flag,
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                     15


      Germany Flag, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Flag, and the Rheinland-
      Pfalz Flag. At a minimum the U.S. and Germany flags must be displayed. If one pole
      system fails the flags must be adjusted so that the U.S. and Germany flags are displayed
      (with the NATO flag falling next in importance). If it is not possible to fly these two
      flags then they must ALL be taken down. The flags will be displayed in accordance with
      the following diagram.
      2.10.5.2. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) This order was created based on flag
      precedence guidance as well as symbolic representation. In order to determine the order
      you must first set a viewers stand point or ―who is the audience looking at the flags.‖ 52
      FW/CCP determined that the 52 FW is the ―audience.‖ If you place the flags in a row
      (from left to right) they should appear as USA, Germany, NATO, and Rheinland-Pfalz.
      You then simply wrap them into a circle and designate the pole closest to the base as #1.
      Symbolically, the USA flag points to the USA controlled area, the Germany and NATO
      flags point out to those areas, and the Rheinland-Pfalz flag points to Spangdahlem town.
   2.10.6. When the flag of the United States is displayed from a staff projecting horizontally or
   at an angle from the windowsill, balcony or front of a building, the union of the flag should
   be placed at the peak of the staff. When the flag is suspended over a sidewalk from a rope
   extending from a house to a pole at the edge of the sidewalk, the flag should be hoisted out,
   union first, from the building (Figure 2.6).

Figure 2.6. Flag of the United States Suspended over a Sidewalk.




   2.10.7. When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be
   uppermost and to the flag‘s own right, that is, to the observer‘s left. When displayed in a
   window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union (or blue field) to the
   left of the observer in the street.
   2.10.8. When the flag is displayed over the middle of the street, it should be suspended
   vertically with the union to the north on an east and west street or to the east on a north and
   south street.
   2.10.9. When used on a speaker‘s platform, the flag, if displayed flat, should be displayed
   above and behind the speaker. When displayed from a staff in a church or public auditorium,
   the flag of the United States should hold the position of superior prominence and in the
   position of honor at the clergyman‘s or speaker‘s right as he faces the audience. Any other
   flag so displayed should be placed on the left of the clergyman or speaker or to the right of
   the audience (Figure 2.7). The flag should always be positioned at the same level or above as
 16                                 AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010


   the clergyman or speaker, never at a lower floor level. When the flag is not on stage but
   placed on the floor in front of the stage, the flag is to the right of the audience.

Figure 2.7. Flag of the United States on Stage with Speaker.




   2.10.10. The flag should never be used as the covering for a statue or monument.
   2.10.11. When the flag is suspended across a corridor or lobby in a building with only one
   main entrance, it should be suspended vertically with the union of the flag to the observer‘s
   left upon entering. If the building has more than one main entrance, the flag should be
   suspended vertically near the center of the corridor or lobby with the union to the north,
   when entrances are to the east and west or to the east when entrances are to the north and
   south. This includes aircraft hangars. It is permitted to have U.S. flag/color team display for
   ceremonial events in front of and in addition to a large permanently affixed U.S. Flag
   displayed in a hanger or building (Figure 2.8).

Figure 2.8. Flag of the United States/Colors with permanently affixed U.S. Flag display.
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                       17


   2.10.12. No flag or pennant may be placed (flown) above the flag of the United States or to
   the right of the American Flag. Flags of other nations are flown or displayed in equal size
   and on poles of equal height, and are never flown below the flag of the United States. While
   the preferred and most traditional method is to fly flags at outside venues on individual flag
   poles, the US Flag Code does permit flags of cities, states, localities, organizations (i.e.
   USAF, MAJCOM, NAF, or Wing flags), pennants of societies or special flags such as
   commemorative/AF Anniversary, Minuteman, or Prisoner of War/Missing in Action
   (POW/MIA) flags to be flown on the same halyard with the United States flag. They should
   be fastened to the halyard at a distance below the United States Flag so that when both are at
   rest the flag of the United States does not touch or overlap the second flag (see Figure 2.9).
   When the flags are flown from adjacent staffs, the flag of the United States should be hoisted
   first and lowered last.

Figure 2.9. Flag of the United States with Minuteman Flag.




   2.10.13. When three flag staffs are positioned outside a building, there may be two display
   options. If the flag staffs are in a straight line, then the flags should be of the same height
   with the flag of the United States to it‘s own right. Use the building looking out to the flags
   as the point of reference for flag placement when flags are in line. If the flag is positioned on
   the center staff, then the center staff must be higher than the other two staffs.
   2.10.14. On a closed casket, the flag will be placed lengthwise, with the union at the head
   and over the left shoulder of the deceased (Figure 2.10). When a full-couch casket is
   opened, the flag will be removed, folded to the triangular shape of a cocked hat and placed in
   the lid at the head end of the casket and just above the decedent‘s left shoulder. When a half-
   couch casket is opened, the flag will be folded on the lower half of the casket in the same
   relative position as when displayed full length on a closed casket. The flag will not be
   lowered into the grave, and it will not be allowed to touch the ground. The interment flag
   may be given to the next of kin at the conclusion of the interment.

Figure 2.10. Flag of the United States Draped over a Closed Casket.


   2.10.15. The flag will be draped left to right when posted and also when used in official
   photographs. The blue field should be on top with stripes running left to right.
 18                                  AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010


   2.10.16. When painted or displayed on an aircraft or vehicle, the union is toward the front
   and the stripes trail.
2.11. Order of Precedence of Flags. The following is the order of precedence of flags:
   2.11.1. The flag of the United States.
   2.11.2. Foreign national flags. Normally, these are displayed in alphabetical order using the
   English alphabet. When in NATO countries, NATO member country flags are displayed in
   French alphabetical order.
   2.11.3. Flag of the President of the United States of America.
   2.11.4. State and territorial flags. State flags should be displayed in order of admittance of
   the state to the Union. Territorial flags, when displayed, are displayed after the state flags in
   the order they were recognized by the United States.
   2.11.5. Military organizational flags of the Services in order of precedence:

       2.11.5.18. Other training organizations of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and
       Coast Guard, in that order, respectively.
       2.11.5.19. Note: In times of war, when the Coast Guard operates as part of the Navy, the
       cadets, Coast Guard Academy, the Coast Guard, and the Coast Guard Reserve take
       precedence after the midshipmen of the Naval Academy, the Navy, and the Navy
       Reserve, respectively.
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                      19

 20                                  AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010


2.12. Respect for the United States Flag. No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the
United States of America; the flag will not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors,
state flags and organizational or institutional flags are always dipped as a mark of respect to the
flag of the United States. During arrival honors, as appropriate for persons listed in Attachment
2, the flag of the United States will not be dipped. However, the Air Force flag and
organizational flags will be dipped as appropriate. Military members will render the military
salute as appropriate. At no time will a foreign national flag be dipped.
   2.12.1. The flag should never be displayed with union down, except as a signal of dire
   distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.
   2.12.2. The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water,
   or merchandise. The flag should never be used as the covering for a statue or monument,
   although it could form a distinctive feature in a ceremony of the unveiling of a statue or
   monument.
   2.12.3. The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.
   2.12.4. The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should
   never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, or in folds, but always allowed to fall free (e.g., the
   flag should not be used to cover a speaker‘s podium, drape the front of a platform or for other
   decoration. A proper substitute is bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the
   blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below).
   2.12.5. The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to
   permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.
   2.12.6. The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.
   2.12.7. The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any
   mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.
   2.12.8. The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or
   delivering anything.
   2.12.9. The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It
   should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed
   or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary
   use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the
   flag is flown.
   2.12.10. No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However,
   a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and
   members of patriotic organizations. A lapel flag pin, being a replica of the flag, should be
   worn on the left lapel near the heart. Patches worn on uniforms depicting the United States
   Flag should be worn on the left shoulder, with the union to the viewers left.
   2.12.11. The flag should not be displayed on a float in a parade except from a staff.
   2.12.12. The flag should not be draped over the hood, top, sides, or back of a vehicle or of a
   railroad train or boat. When the flag is displayed on a motorcar, the staff shall be fixed firmly
   to the chassis or clamped to the right fender.
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                      21


   2.12.13. No other flag or pennant should be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right
   (observer‘s left) of the flag of the United States, except during church services conducted by
   naval chaplains at sea, when the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church
   services for the personnel of the Navy.
2.13. Display of the United States Flag at Half-Staff. The United States flag shall be flown at
half-staff throughout the United States and its territories and possessions on all DoD buildings,
grounds, and naval vessels on several days throughout the year.
   2.13.1. The following days apply:
       2.13.1.1. On Memorial Day until noon, then raised to the top of the staff.
       2.13.1.2. On Peace Officers Memorial Day, May 15 of each year, unless that day is also
       Armed Forces Day.
       2.13.1.3. On Patriot Day, September 11 of each year.
       2.13.1.4. On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, December 7 of each year.
       2.13.1.5. Each year in honor of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service
       according to Public Law 107-51. This date is usually the first Sunday in October and is
       announced annually by Presidential Proclamation.
       2.13.1.6. On the death of individuals in accordance with Attachment 3.
       2.13.1.7. When so directed by the President of the United States or the Secretary of
       Defense.
   2.13.2. The responsible military commander shall ensure the procedures for flying the flag at
   half-staff are executed as follows:
       2.13.2.1. The term half-staff means the position of the flag when it is one-half the
       distance between the top and bottom of the staff.
       2.13.2.2. The flag, when flown at half-staff, should be first hoisted to the peak for an
       instant and then lowered to the half-staff position. The flag should again be raised to the
       peak before it is lowered for the day.
   2.13.3. The flag shall be flown at half-staff outside the United States on DoD buildings,
   grounds, and naval vessels even if another nation‘s flag is flown full-staff next to the flag of
   the United States.
   2.13.4. All flags displayed with the flag of the United States should be flown at half-staff
   when the flag of the United States is flown at half-staff with the exception of foreign national
   flags.
   2.13.5. The Heads of DoD Components may direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on
   buildings, grounds, or naval vessels under their jurisdiction on occasions other than those
   specified in paragraph 2.13.1 and Attachment 3, when they consider it proper and
   appropriate. Within the Air Force, this authority is delegated to the installation commander.
   Any time an installation commander decides to fly the flag at half-staff based on this local
   authority for a local death, the base marquee(s) should state the reason to avoid confusion.
 22                                  AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010


   2.13.6. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Due to its location off installation, the flags flown
   at the Friendship Circle will not be flown at half-staff for any reason unless directed by the
   52 FW/CC. In the event the flags are required to be raised and/or lowered, direction will
   come from the 52 FW/CC or his staff (i.e. FW/CCP//FW/CP). 52 SFS will subsequently be
   notified to raise and lower the flags. If the flags are lowered they must be stored at 52
   FW/CCP until such time as they may be raised again. If it is after duty hours or on the
   weekend the flags will be stored at the 52 SFS LE desk until such time as 52 FW/CCP may
   receive them.
2.14. Hoisting and Lowering the United States Flag. During the ceremony of hoisting or
lowering the flag, all persons present, except those in formation, should face the flag and stand at
attention. Those present in uniform should stand at attention and render the military salute. When
not in uniform, stand at attention with the right hand over the heart; if headgear is worn, remove
it with the right hand and hold at the left shoulder, with the hand being over the heart. Non-US
citizens should stand at attention. When the flag is lowered from the staff, no portion of it is
allowed to touch the ground either in lowering or folding. The flag is detached from the halyard
and folded as prescribed in Attachment 4.
2.15. Flag Folding Ceremony. This paragraph discusses folding the flag of the United States at
ceremonies other than military funerals. According to Title 4, Flag and Seal, Seat of Government
and the States of the United States Code, there is no specific meaning assigned to the folds of the
flag. Although there are flag folding ceremony options offered by various national interest
groups, these are not official Air Force ceremonies. The Air Force developed a script which
provides an historical perspective on the flag. There are no ceremonies in the Air Force
requiring a script to be read when the flag is folded. However, when a flag folding ceremony is
desired and conducted by Air Force personnel at any location, on or off an installation, this script
is the only one which may be used. This includes printing in programs and/or any handouts. See
Attachment 4 for this script and a diagram depicting the proper method for folding the flag of
the United States.
2.16. Ceremonial Reviews. Render proper courtesies to the flag during parades or passes in
review:
   2.16.1. When in a moving column, the salute should be rendered six paces before passing the
   flag and held until six paces past the flag.
   2.16.2. When attending ceremonial reviews, personnel in uniform should render a salute as
   the flag passes their position. Personnel not in uniform should stand at attention and place
   their right hand over their heart.
2.17. National Anthem. Title 36, Patriotic Societies and Observances of the United States
Code, Section 301 provides guidance on conduct during the playing of the National Anthem. The
National Anthem, first verse, is the only song authorized for playing at Air Force Ceremonies
when colors are presented. God Bless America or other patriotic songs will not be substituted
for the Nation Anthem.
   2.17.1. Outdoors. When the flag is displayed, all present except those in formation, should
   stand at attention facing the flag with their right hand over their heart. Members of the
   Armed Forces and veterans who are present, but not in uniform, may render the military
   salute. All others should remove their hat with their right hand and hold the headdress at the
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                       23


   left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Individuals in uniform should give the military
   salute at the first note of the National Anthem and maintain that position until the last note.
   When the flag is not displayed, all present should face toward the music and act in the same
   manner they would if the flag were displayed.
   2.17.2. Indoors. Military members in uniform, while in formations, should wear appropriate
   headgear and render the military salute at the first note of the National Anthem and maintain
   that position until the last note. While not wearing headgear during an indoor ceremony,
   military members, information or not, should stand at attention at the first note of the
   National Anthem and maintain that position until the last note without rendering the military
   salute. There is one exception to this. Military members in uniform, under arms, should
   salute. Civilians should stand at attention facing the flag with their right hand over their
   heart.
   2.17.3. During the playing of national anthems of friendly nations, military members and
   civilians should render the same customs and courtesies as those given during the playing of
   the United States National Anthem.
       2.17.3.1. The performance of the national anthem of any foreign country will be
       followed, without pause, by playing the National Anthem of the United States. When two
       or more foreign national anthems are played, the United States National Anthem is
       performed last.
       2.17.3.2. Anthems of the United States or anthems of any foreign nations are never
       incorporated into any musical arrangement, composition, or medley and must be played
       through without repetition of any part except as required to make both the words and
       music complete.
2.18. Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge of Allegiance to the flag, I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God,
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all should be rendered by standing at attention and facing
the flag. When not in uniform, persons should remove any non-religious headdress with their
right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, with the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform
should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute if outdoors and indoors if in
formation and wearing appropriate headdress. If indoors and without headdress, military
members should stand at attention, remain silent, and face the flag. Military members in uniform
do not recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.
2.19. To the Colors. To the Colors is not the National Anthem, it is only a bugle call and is
sometimes played instead of the National Anthem, although it is not recommended as a
replacement to the National Anthem. During To the Colors, military members and civilians
should render the same customs and courtesies as those given to the playing of the National
Anthem.
2.20. Taps Taps began as a signal to ―extinguish lights‖ or ―lights out‖ at the end of the day.
Many bases across the Air Force play Taps to signify lights out or to begin quiet hours. For these
purposes, there are no formal protocol procedures required. However, upon hearing Taps at a
military ceremony (military funeral/memorial ceremony), proper protocol dictates those
individuals in uniform render appropriate honors, indoor or outdoor, until the music is complete.
Civilians should remove their headgear and place their hand over their heart.
 24                                  AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010


   2.20.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Upon hearing Taps all personnel in uniform will
   come to the position of attention, face the music, and render a salute for the duration of the
   music. Members not in uniform will stand at attention, face the music, and remove head
   covers. They may render a salute if they so choose. If in a vehicle during Taps, pull the car
   to the side of the road, turn the vehicle off, and engage your 4-way hazard lights. All
   occupants will sit quietly at attention until the last note of the music has played. They will
   not exit their vehicle to render salutes.
2.21. Reveille and Retreat. Flags on stationary flag staffs are only saluted during Reveille,
Retreat or special ceremonies. In these cases, when outside and in uniform, face the flag (if
visible) or face the music. Stand at attention and salute on the first note of the music (or if no
music, when you see the flag first being raised or lowered). Drop your salute after the last note is
played, or when the flag has been fully raised or lowered, depending on the ceremony (during the
playing of "Sound Retreat" which precedes the lowering of the flag, stand at Parade Rest). If in a
vehicle during Reveille or Retreat, pull the car to the side of the road and stop. All occupants sit
quietly at attention until the last note of the music has played. When in civilian clothes and
outdoors, stand at attention and place your right hand (with a hat if wearing one) over your heart.
   2.21.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Upon hearing the playing of Reveille or Retreat,
   when outside and in uniform, face the flag (if visible) or face the music. Stand at attention
   and salute on the first note of the music (or if no music, when you see the flag first being
   raised or lowered). Drop your salute after the last note is played, or when the flag has been
   fully raised or lowered, depending on the ceremony (during the playing of "Sound Retreat"
   which precedes the lowering of the flag, stand at Parade Rest). Both the German and U.S.
   National Anthems are played on Spangdahlem Air Base (SAB). All personnel in uniform
   will render a salute for both Anthems. If in a vehicle during Reveille or Retreat, pull the car
   to the side of the road, turn the vehicle off, and engage your 4-way hazard lights. All
   occupants will sit quietly at attention until the last note of the music has played. They will
   not exit their vehicle to render salutes. When in civilian clothes and outdoors, stand at
   attention for Reveille and the German and U.S. National Anthems. Place your right hand
   (with a hat if wearing one) over your heart during the U.S. National Anthem only. Military
   members in civilian clothes may render a salute if they so choose.
   2.21.2. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of
   Air Force Personnel, directs that saluting is not required when wearing the Air Force
   Physical Training (PT) uniform. If an Air Force member is wearing the Air Force PT
   uniform during Reveille, Retreat, or Taps, the member should observe the same protocols as
   someone wearing civilian clothing. Stand at attention for Reveille, Taps, and the German
   and U.S. National Anthems. Place your right hand (with a hat if wearing one) over your
   heart during the U.S. National Anthem only.

Section 2C—Air Force Flags

2.22. United States Air Force Departmental Flag. This section describes the United States
Air Force Departmental Flag (Figure 2.11). The departmental flag is made of rayon or synthetic
substitute material, ultramarine blue in color. The distinctive center design is the Air Force Coat
of Arms and the encircling 13 white stars from the Seal of the Department of the Air Force.
―United States Air Force‖ is inscribed on a scroll attached to the bottom of the shield. The design
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                      25


of the United Air Force Departmental Flag appears on both sides of the flag. The design is
reversed on the reverse side of the flag (it is backwards on the reverse side), but all lettering
reads correctly from left to right on both sides. The eagle always faces toward the staff on both
sides. There are two authorized sizes of the United States Air Force Departmental Flag: The
ceremonial (4 feet 4 inches by 5 feet 6 inches) is authorized for optional use with streamers. The
smaller Air Force flag (3 feet by 4 feet) will not be used with streamers. Uses and descriptions
for each size are detailed below. These provisions also apply to Air Force Reserve and Air
National Guard organizations.
2.22. (SPANGDAHLEMAB)It is the responsibility of the 52d Civil Engineer Squadron. To
repair and perform maintenance on the flag poles at the Friendship Circle. It is the responsibility
of the 52 SFS to raise and lower the flags as needed as well as maintain all appropriate keys to
the flag poles. The keys will be maintained at the LE desk and checked out as required by 52
SFS personnel. It is the responsibility of the 52 FW/CCP to purchase and store new and
unserviceable flags.

   2.22.1. The ceremonial size United States Air Force Departmental Flag, with or without
   streamers, is 4 feet 4 inches by 5 feet 6 inches, and is trimmed on three edges with a rayon
   fringe of yellow 2 inches wide. The ceremonial size of the United States Air Force
   Departmental Flag also serves as the HQ USAF flag.
   2.22.2. The size of the United States Flag should determine the appropriate size of the Air
   Force flag used when displaying them together. Both sizes of the Air Force flag match
   approved sizes of the United States Flag and Air Force positional flags (see paragraph 2.27)
   which makes displaying them together easier. Consideration should always be given to
   ensure appropriate respect to the flag of the United States.
   2.22.3. The United States Air Force Departmental Flag, either size, (ceremonial size
   optionally with or without streamers), may be displayed only when representing the
   Department of the Air Force on State and official occasions. It may be used at joint command
   headquarters, joint service schools, and similar joint activities where the United States Air
   Force is a participant or is represented. Its use is authorized on such other occasions as may
   be recommended by installation commanders.
   2.22.4. Each MAJCOM is authorized one ceremonial-sized United States Air Force
   Departmental Flag with streamers (paragraph 2.30) for permanent indoor use and display at
   its headquarters.

   2.22.5. The 3 feet by 4 feet version of the Air Force Departmental Flag is identical in design
   to the ceremonial size, but is displayed without streamers. This smaller version may be used
   on all occasions the larger ceremonial flag may be used; however, it is not to be used with
   streamers. Its size matches identically with the size of the general officers‘ flags and the Air
   Force Senior Executive Service flag and should be used in ceremonies or events in which all
   flags need to be of the same size.
   2.22.6. When displayed with departmental flags of other United States military services,
   precedence is as follows: Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard.
   2.22.7. When displayed or carried with flags of other Air Force organizations, foreign
   national flags, or State flags, the order of precedence is as follows: The United States flag,
   foreign national flags, state flags, Air Force flag, and flags of other Air Force organizations.
   2.22.8. The Air Force departmental flag is an organizational flag and is dipped while the
   National Anthem, ―To the Colors,‖ musical honors for Chief of Staff of the Air Force or
   higher, or a foreign national anthem is played. The Departmental Flag is also dipped when
   rendering honors to the Secretary of the Air Force, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, their
   direct representative, or any government official of equivalent or higher grade, including
   foreign dignitaries. Additionally, the departmental flag and other subordinate flags will be
   dipped during military funeral honors. This includes the movement and transfer of the
   remains, the playing of ―muffled ruffles‖ and ―Taps.‖ The departmental flag will not be
   dipped under any other circumstances.

   foreign dignitaries. Additionally, the departmental flag and other subordinate flags will be
   dipped during military funeral honors. This includes the movement and transfer of the
   remains, the playing of ―muffled ruffles‖ and ―Taps.‖ The departmental flag will not be
   dipped under any other circumstances.
2.23. Organizational Flags. Design and Description: Organizational flags are rayon or
synthetic substitute material, ultramarine blue field, 3 feet by 4 feet, trimmed on three edges with
a fringe of yellow rayon 2 inches wide. The shield contains the organizational emblem, and the
scroll beneath contains the organization‘s designation. The design on organizational flags
appears on both sides of the flag. However, the design is reversed on the reverse side of the flag,
but all lettering reads correctly from the left to right on both sides. The eagle always faces toward
the staff on both sides.
   2.23.1. Authorization and Display: Organizational heraldry (including flags) on a shield type
   emblem is not authorized for units without a headquarters designation and are used on
   ceremonial occasions when the organization is represented. Organizational flags are kept at
   the headquarters to which issue is authorized. There are two authorized ways to display
   organizational flags of several commands. When they are displayed in a group, they can be
   displayed either alphabetically or numerically, as applicable, within groupings of each
   echelon or command. The host commander is the authorized authority to determine display.
   The host flag is displayed at the center of the groupings.
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                    27

       further discussion on authorized unit emblems.
       2.23.1.2. Groups and comparable organizations having a headquarters component, if
       permanently assigned and aligned with a higher echelon (groups to wings, or centers to
       Air Force Materiel Command, as examples) may use the emblem design of the higher
       echelon, with their own unit designation on the scroll.
       2.23.1.3. Organizations authorized a flag, which do not have approved emblems, shall
       use the provisional flag (Figure 2.12). The words "United States Air Force" appear on

Figure 2.27. Assistant Secretaries and General Counsel of the Air Force.




2.27. Individual Flags or Personal Colors. General officers are authorized flags depicting
their rank.
   2.27.1. General/Flag Officer personal colors (Figure 2.28) are made of rayon or synthetic
   substitute material. These flags are 3 feet by 4 feet, trimmed on three sides with a 2½ inch
   yellow fringe. They will be blue (Air Force/Navy) or red (Army/Marine Corps) for the main
   line of the service, but other variations do exist for non-line career fields (i.e. Army medical
   and Chaplain Service, Navy Staff Corps). Consult specific service regulations for non-line
   specifications. All will bear the number of five-pointed white stars that identify the grade of
   the officer within the field. Placement of the stars is shown below. Note that the layout of the
   white stars are the same for Air Force/Army and Navy/Marine Corps respectively. General
   officer flags can be used at ceremonies when the officer whom it represents is officiating or
   participating in the event. Personal colors are not displayed for general officers attending, but
   not participating in the event. General officers are entitled to the issue of one ceremonial flag
   for each general officer rank to which they are promoted (below is order of precedence).
   When promoted, previous personal flags may be furled and cased and the flag of the new
   rank uncased and unfurled. Current and retired officer's personal colors will only be cased at
   the individual‘s interment.

Figure 2.28. General Officer Flags (Personal Colors).




   2.27.2. Retired general officers of the Air Force may display their individual flags privately
   in their homes. Public display of individual flags for retired general officers is prohibited
   except when the officer is in uniform and being honored at an official military ceremony, the
   officer is in attendance on the reviewing stand in an official ceremony, or the officer is
   serving in an official capacity (such as guest speaker or presiding officer), and another flag
   depicting his or her rank is not already displayed. For retired general officers formerly
   authorized a positional flag (such as a former Chief of Staff of the Air Force), the 4-star flag
   would be displayed during ceremonies.
      2.27.2.1. It is not the custom or tradition in the Air Force to fly Personal Colors or
      Positional Colors out in front of the Headquarter Building of General Officers, as it is in
      other services. The only place you may find this is at Joint Headquarters where the Air
      Force may follow the custom and tradition of that Joint Command.
   2.27.3. Senior Executive Service (SES). This flag (Figure 2.29) is 3 feet by 4 feet and
   consists of an ultramarine blue field bearing the SES emblem in the center with the Air Force
   crest encircled with stars (eagle, wreath and cloud form) placed above the emblem. The SES
   flag is trimmed on three sides with a 2½ inch yellow fringe. This flag can be used at
   ceremonies when a member of the SES is present and has an active role in the ceremony. It is
   never appropriate to case a SES member‘s individual flag. SES flags maybe purchased by the
   individual on his/her retirement if they wish to keep their flag.

   2.28.1. Groups, because they are an Air Force establishment, are authorized to display and
   use an organizational flag. However, groups are also authorized to display and use a guidon
   instead of an organizational flag. The local installation commander has approval authority to
   determine if groups will display and use an organizational flag or guidon.

Air Force installations. A complete set of campaign streamers is displayed on the United States
Air Force Departmental Ceremonial Flag. This complete set represents all campaigns that Air
Force units participated in as a unit. Authorized unit decoration streamers and campaign
streamers are carried on organizational flags and guidons on ceremonial occasions. Streamers are
a component part of the ceremonial flag and may be displayed at the discretion of the responsible
official of the organization having a ceremonial flag. Attachment 5 provides a listing of

   or in personal areas. (No individual is prohibited from the private possession of a flag.
   However, its display is not authorized in any manner that can be interpreted as representing
   the United States, its military units, or individuals as members of the Air Force.) Local
   installation commanders may authorize the display of the 50 state flags without the territorial
   flags on their installation.
   2.33.2. Display of state flags with the United States flag. When displayed in a straight line,
   all at equal height, the United States flag will be displayed to its own right with the state flags
   displayed to its left (right being the viewing audiences left). If displayed with the United
   States flag centered, with states flags radiating from the center, the flag of the United States
   will be at the highest point of the group. The state flags will be displayed in the order of
   succession into the Union, beginning on the United States flag‘s own right then alternating
   left then right, and so on (Figure 2.33).

2.35. Accessories: The following guidelines apply:
   2.35.1. Flagstaffs.
       2.35.1.1. Stationary. All stationary flagstaffs constructed at Air Force installations are
       normally 50 feet in height.
       2.35.1.2. Ceremonial and Organizational. Use flagstaffs at all times when displaying or
       carrying ceremonial or organizational flags. Only flagstaffs displaying ceremonial size
       flags (4 feet 4 inches by 5 feet 6 inches) are 9 feet in length. When displaying other sized
       flags, the flagstaffs can be either 7 or 8 feet in length plus the staff ornament. When
       displaying 3 feet by 4 feet flags, a flagstaff of 7 feet in length is recommended and the
       flagstaff of 8 feet in length is an option; the flagstaff of 9 feet in length should not be
       used.
       2.35.1.3. Guidon. Flagstaffs for guidons are 8 feet in length plus the staff ornament.
   2.35.2. Staff Ornament, Flagstaff Head or Finial. The decorative device at the top of a
   flagstaff is the finial. It is precedence that the eagle finial be used only with the Presidential
   flag. However, if the U.S. flag is displayed with the Presidential flag, then both may have the
   eagle finial. The spearhead, acorn, and ball finials that were previously used are no longer
   Air Force standard. Upon replacing or purchasing new finials through attrition, the eagle,
   spearhead, acorn, or ball should not be purchased. All finials in a display or ceremony should
   be the same. This does not restrict the display of a state flag from a staff bearing a state
   device when national and other state flags are displayed from adjacent flagstaffs; however,
   the Air Force does not provide such devices. The following finials are authorized for flags
   used by Air Force organizations:
       2.35.2.1. Eagle (for the Presidential Flag).
       2.35.2.2. Spade, silver in color (primary finial used by the Air Force).
   2.35.3. Flag Cases. Flag cases are made of any suitable material, preferably waterproof, with
   sufficient length and width to adequately cover flags when on flagstaffs and are not
   displayed. Use flag cases to cover flags when being stored or carried on other than
   ceremonial occasions.
   2.35.4. Flag Slings. Flag slings (sometimes referred to as harnesses) must be used at all
   times to carry flags during outdoor ceremonies. Flag slings are black, patent leather with
   silver buckles for dress occasions. For practice or non-dress occasions, black leather (non-
   patent) or dark blue slings are authorized.
   2.35.5. Bases. A weighted, silver colored base is the preferred base for use by the Air Force.
   Upon replacing or purchasing new bases through attrition, the silver colored base should be
   purchased.
2.36. Procurement and Disposition of Flags and Accoutrements. The following guidelines
apply:
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                  43


  2.36.1. Procedures for Requisitions. Procedures for requisitioning organizational flags,
  guidons and streamers by activities are outlined in AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual,
  Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 10, Section 10L, with additional information furnished in AFI 84-
  105, Organizational Lineage, Honors and Heraldry, and AFI 36-2803, The Air Force
  Awards and Decorations Program. A National Stock Number (NSN) listing of flags, guidons
  and streamers is in Attachment 6.
  2.36.2. Organizational Flags. Units (group-level or above) with an approved organizational
  emblem are authorized an organizational flag. Requisitions for organizational flags must be
  accompanied by a full-scale Institute of Heraldry (IOH) approved drawing (current copy) of
  the emblem design (shield), including motto to be embroidered on the scroll, and must be
  submitted with a DD Form 1348 or 1348-6. A motto is optional, however, if the organization
  has no motto, the present organizational name is embroidered on the scroll. It is
  recommended the drawing for the organizational flag be annotated with the requisition
  number, as occasionally the drawing and the requisitions become separated at Defense
  Supply Center, Philadelphia (DSCP) and present a problem in matching the appropriate
  drawing to the correct requisition.
     2.36.2.1. Requisitions for the organizational flag are to be mailed with a current full
     scale drawing approved by the Institute of Heraldry to 311 HSW/YACL-PA (AFCTO),
     700 Robbins Ave Bldg 6/ D South, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5096.
     2.36.2.2. Air Force organizations not having an approved organizational flag emblem
     design will forward a request, in writing, to HQ AFHRA/RS, 600 Chennault Circle,
     Maxwell AFB, AL 36112-6426, to obtain design approval.
  2.36.3. Requisitions for Guidons and Streamers should be forwarded via facsimile. The fax
  number of the 311 HSW/YACL-PA, is DSN 444-3986 or Commercial (215) 737-3986. Only
  typed DD Forms 1348 or 1348-6‘s in MILSTRIP format with Routing Identifier Code S9T in
  cc‘s 4-6 are accepted. Requisition forms must contain appropriate remarks, i.e., inscriptions
  to be embroidered on the Streamer or type ―Blank‖ when embroidery is not required; unit
  designation to be embroidered on Guidon, numerals and lettering with eight characters and
  authorized abbreviations will be embroidered with a 3½ inch height. For longer units, the
  maximum numerals and letters acceptable are 16 characters embroidered with a 1¾ inch
  height.
     2.36.3.1. Guidons. Embroidering information will be shown in the remarks or
     description column of the requisition.
     2.36.3.2. The two-foot length is only for Presidential citation streamers, the three-foot
     length is for use with organizational flags, and the four-foot length is used with the
     ceremonial flag. In Attachment 5, the campaign streamers that are identified with an
     asterisk require the four-foot length to accommodate the required embroidery regardless
     of which flag it is displayed on. Separate requisitions are required for each streamer
     requiring different embroidery. If a streamer is desired without embroidery, No
     embroidery required should be annotated in the description section of the requisition.
  2.36.4. Issuing Flags and Flagstaffs to General Officers. The Air Force General Officer
  Management Office notifies the Air Force Clothing and Textile Office (AFCTO/MMIC),
  2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia PA 19101, of all general officer promotions.

       for and retained by the Air Force when a member of the Senior Executive Service
       separates or retires. However, supervisors may present the SES flag to a
       separating/retiring member after notifying Air Force Senior Executive Management
       Office of their intent to present the member‘s flag. Additional flags may be purchased by
       calling that office for further details.
2.37. Disposition of Flags and Related Items. The following guidance applies:
   2.37.1. Personal colors flags, with appropriate accessories, furnished to general officers may
   be retained by such officers on release from active duty. Other flags in their possession,

   channels.
   2.37.3. The flag of an inactivated Air National Guard unit may be returned to its home
   station on the request of the Governor.
   2.37.4. Unserviceable flags should be destroyed in accordance with paragraph 2.4.2 If the
   streamers displayed with the unserviceable flag are serviceable, they are to be retained and
   used on a replacement flag. Contact your local honor guard for appropriate procedures.

          TITLES, FORMS OF ADDRESS AND MILITARY ABBREVIATIONS

6.1. Forms of Address. Good manners and common courtesy dictate the use of correct forms
of address and titles in both conversation and correspondence. There are many resources
available that cover titles and various forms of address for all levels of the United States and
international governments. The most widely accepted is Protocol, The Complete Handbook of
Diplomatic, Official and Social Usage by McCaffree, Innis, and Sand.
   6.1.1. Address officials, i.e., Presidents, Ambassadors, and Cabinet members by their titles,
   never by name alone, e.g., Good Afternoon Mr. President, or Good Evening President Jones,
   not Good Evening Mr. Jones.
   6.1.2. Spouses of high-ranking officials, to include the Vice President and Cabinet members,
   do not share their spouse‘s official titles; therefore address them as Mr. or Mrs. or Ms. along
   with their surname, i.e., ―It is a pleasure to have you join us tonight Mrs. Jones.‖ Care must
   be taken to ensure that the spouse uses the same surname as the principal, as in this example.
   A phone call or check ahead of time to determine their preference will save embarrassment.
   6.1.3. Refer to all presidential appointees once confirmed by Congress as well as Federal and
   State elected officials as ―The Honorable‖ when performing introductions. For example,
   introducing a speaker, ―The Honorable Suzanne Smith‖ is correct. However, when speaking
   directly to them, one would not say, ―good morning Honorable Smith,‖ but rather ―good
   morning Mrs. (or appropriate honorific) Smith.‖ The following is a partial list of American
   officials using "The Honorable".
       6.1.3.1. Executive Branch.
           6.1.3.1.1. Members of the Cabinet.
           6.1.3.1.2. Deputy Secretaries of the executive departments.
           6.1.3.1.3. Under Secretaries of the executive departments (officers of comparable
           rank).
           6.1.3.1.4. Special Assistants to the President.
           6.1.3.1.5. Deputy Under Secretaries of executive departments.
           6.1.3.1.6. Assistant Secretaries, Legal Advisor/Counselor (officers of comparable
           rank).
           6.1.3.1.7. American Ambassadors.
       6.1.3.2. Judiciary Branch (Current Justices of the Supreme Court are called "Justice").
           6.1.3.2.1. Judges of other courts.
           6.1.3.2.2. Presiding Justice of a court.
       6.1.3.3. Legislative Branch.
           6.1.3.3.1. Senate.
              6.1.3.3.1.1. The President of the Senate (V.P. of the U.S.).
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                      49


             6.1.3.3.1.2. President Pro Tempore of the Senate.
             6.1.3.3.1.3. Senators.
             6.1.3.3.1.4. Sergeant-at-Arms.
         6.1.3.3.2. House of Representatives.
             6.1.3.3.2.1. The Speaker.
             6.1.3.3.2.2. Representatives.
             6.1.3.3.2.3. Sergeant-at-Arms.
     6.1.3.4. State and Local Governments.
         6.1.3.4.1. Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Acting Governor of a state.
         6.1.3.4.2. Secretary of State.
         6.1.3.4.3. Chief Justice of State Supreme Court.
         6.1.3.4.4. State Attorney General (except PA--not an elected position).
         6.1.3.4.5. Treasurer, Comptroller or Auditor of a state (only treasurer in PA.).
         6.1.3.4.6. President of the Senate of a state.
         6.1.3.4.7. State Senator.
         6.1.3.4.8. Speaker of the House/Assembly/House of Delegates of a state.
         6.1.3.4.9. State Representative/ Assemblyman/Delegate.
         6.1.3.4.10. Mayor (elected).
  6.1.4. Although the courtesy title His/Her Excellency is frequently accorded to foreign
  officials in very high positions, it is rarely used in addressing officials in the United States.
  However, some states accord this honor to their Governor. It is appropriate to call the
  Governor‘s office and request clarification to determine if this title should be used.
  6.1.5. There are two forms of academic titles, the doctorate and the position. If the person
  holding the doctorate is also a professor, either "Dr." or "Professor" is correct. This also
  holds true for those holding a title such as "Chancellor," "President," etc. If the title-holder
  does not also have a doctorate, address him or her by title.
  6.1.6. Foreign Title-Holders. A few common examples are: "Your Excellency" when
  addressing a foreign ambassador, a foreign chief of state, a president of a foreign republic,
  the head of government, a foreign cabinet officer, or other foreign official. "Your Highness"
  is used to address foreign royalty other than a king or queen (such as a baron, earl or
  princess, etc.). "Your Majesty" denotes a king or queen.
  6.1.7. Military Chaplains. Always address military chaplains as "Chaplain". When
  addressing her/ him in writing, it should read, "Chaplain, Colonel Jill Smith".
  6.1.8. Military Doctors/Dentists. Doctors and dentists can be addressed as either "Doctor" or
  by their rank. Always use their rank when writing.
 50                                 AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010


   6.1.9. Military Lawyers. Lawyers are entitled to the use of "esquire" following their last
   name, but for military lawyers this is never done. Only their rank is used. It is acceptable for
   a military lawyer to use this designation without their rank when they are communicating
   with civilians in an unofficial capacity. For military purposes, always use rank.
   6.1.10. Air Force Pamphlet 34-1202, Guide to Protocol, provides more guidance, especially
   for addressing envelopes. For anything not covered, refer to Protocol, The Complete
   Handbook of Diplomatic, Official and Social Usage by McCaffree, Innis, and Sand.
6.2. Military Rank Abbreviations. The military is rich in customs, courtesies and Service-
specific traditions. One specific tradition is the use of Service-unique abbreviations for rank,
which when used in written correspondence, indicates which branch of Military Service an
individual is from. In written correspondence, at every level, only the correct Service-unique
abbreviations are acceptable. However, today‘s automated environment often masks this military
tradition. Attachment 9 and Attachment 10 provide appropriate military abbreviations for the
Services.
   6.2.1. When a woman holds rank or title, always use it. This rule is no different than that
   used for men. The problem for many people occurs in addressing correspondence when the
   woman is married. The following should help you out in that situation:
       6.2.1.1. When the woman is military and the man is not, her name comes before his. The
       same is true when she holds a title and he does not. Ex: "Lt Col Jane Smith and Mr. John
       Smith;" "Lt Col Jane and John Smith" is also correct.
       6.2.1.2. When they are both in the military or hold titles, the ranking person's name
       comes first, unless the invitation is especially for the lower-ranking member (an awards
       ceremony honoring them, for instance) and their spouse as their guest. Ex: "Capt Susan
       Doe and Lt Mark Doe;" "Capt Susan and Lt Mark Doe" works too.
       6.2.1.3. When both spouses are of equal rank, the man's name comes first, unless the
       invitation is particularly for the woman, with her husband as her guest/escort. Ex:
       "Colonel Bill Jones and Colonel Mary Jones" or "Colonels Bill and Mary Jones."
6.3. Foreign Military. Members of a foreign military are accorded the same honors and respect
we render to our own. A few foreign militaries use the same rank names we use, often with
different symbols for these on their uniforms. Most foreign militaries have different names and
symbols for their rank. When you are in contact with a foreign member's liaison office (or
equivalent), use this as an appropriate time to find out the rank and correct form of address. If
you get confused or forget what to call a foreign military member, a polite "Sir" or "Ma'am"
should always get you by with no problems.

                                           Chapter 7

                                        PRECEDENCE

7.1. Introduction. Precedence is the right to higher honor or priority of importance at a
ceremonial or formal occasion. Order of precedence mistakes may create a negative Service
image. You must validate precedence before execution of any ceremony, honors or event.
Determining order of precedence is the starting point for all you do with an official function,
from organizing the order of the arrival and departure, to seating, to introductions of
distinguished guests.
   7.1.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) 1.Precedence at 52 FW functions will be determined
   according to position, rather than strictly by rank or date of rank.
7.2. Determining Precedence.
   7.2.1. The President of the United States determines precedence for U.S. officials. The
   President may change the order of precedence within the government. An example of this
   occurred when President Kennedy elevated the Speaker of the House of Representatives to a
   position ahead of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
   7.2.2. The U.S. Department of State determines precedence among foreign representatives.
   Due to the dynamic nature of administrations and world politics, the State Department Office
   of Protocol maintains a precedence list, but does not make it available to the general public.
   7.2.3. The Secretary of Defense determines precedence for Department of Defense (DoD)
   officials. Periodically, the Director, Administration and Management (OSD(A&M)), issues a
   revision memorandum to the DoD Order of Precedence.
7.3. Precedence Lists.
   7.3.1. There is no single official precedence list used by all agencies and departments of the
   Federal Government. Moreover, there is no definitive all-encompassing guide for
   determining precedence in any situation. The decision to rank one person ahead of another
   absent guidance is based on the purpose of the occasion and the best interests of the Air
   Force and the United States.
   7.3.2. The Air Force Protocol Office compiles and maintains the Air Force Precedence List
   based mainly on the Department of Defense Order of Precedence memorandum; the ―Flight
   Plan VIP Codes‖ published in the DOD Flight Information Publication ―GENERAL
   PLANNING;‖ Protocol - The Complete Handbook of Diplomatic, Official and Social Usage
   by McCaffree, Innis, and Sand; and Service Etiquette by Oretha D. Swartz. Refer to the
   protocol page of the Air Force Services Agency Community of Practice web site,
   https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-MS-AF-16, for current
   information. The Air Force precedence list is intended for use in determining priority for
   military airlift based on job responsibilities and may be used as a protocol guide for seating at
   official functions. It is not intended to supplant long-standing service etiquette associated
   with the customs and courtesies extended and received between individuals of different
   ranks.
 52                                 AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010


        7.3.2.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) The order of precedence for the 52 FW groups
        is: 52d Operations Group (52 OG), 52d Maintenance Group (52 MXG), 52d Munitions
        Maintenance Group (52 MMG), 52d Mission Support Group (52 MSG), and 52d Medical
        Group (52 MDG). The following order should be used when determining order of
        introductions and seating during ceremonies and other official events:

      Note: When a 0-6 deputy group commander is in attendance, they will be introduced
      before a 0-5 DS.
7.4. Military Precedence.
   7.4.1. When position held is not a factor, precedence among officers on active duty,
   including retired officers on active duty, is determined first by rank. When ranks are the
   same, precedence is determined by date of rank. When dates of rank are the same,
   precedence is determined by total active federal military service date. When date of rank and
   total active federal military service date are the same, officers of the Regular Air Force take
   precedence among themselves according to their position on the permanent promotion list.
   They are followed by Guard officers on extended active duty who shall precede Reserve
   officers on extended active duty. Guard and Reserve officers not on extended active duty
   follow.
   7.4.2. Refer to the USAF General Officers Relative Rank List (maintained by the Air Force
   General Officer Management Office) to determine relative rank among general officers in the
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                         53


   Air Force. The other military services maintain the same type of relative rank list, but it is not
   made available to the general public. To obtain the precedence order or date of rank for flag
   or general officers of other military services, contact the principal party‘s office or their
   protocol office.
      7.4.2.1. Distinguished Visitor (DV) codes are assigned to General Officers and Senior
      Executive Service (SES) civilians. DV codes are used to determine precedence for
      official visits, assignment of quarters and government transportation travel status.
   7.4.3. Retired officers rank with, but after, active duty officers of the same rank. Precedence
   for retired officers of the same rank is determined by date of rank. Retired general officers
   with positional precedence (e.g. former Chief of Staff or former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of
   Staff) are placed ahead of other retired officers of the same rank and by date of rank among
   others with similar positional precedence (e.g. two former Chiefs of Staff).
   7.4.4. Frocking of an officer to a higher grade entitles the individual to all honors, courtesies
   and benefits of the higher grade with the exception of pay and allowances. The officer is
   seated and given precedence ahead of others in the actual pay grade but behind all
   individuals actually holding the rank to which frocked. When more than one person frocked
   to the same rank is present, the effective date of frocking dictates precedence order. The rank
   currently worn determines the honors, courtesies and benefits accorded to the individual.
   7.4.5. Individuals on approved promotion lists continue to wear the insignia of the rank of
   the current pay grade and are accorded precedence in the current grade based on date of rank
   in that grade. The rank currently worn determines the honors, courtesies and benefits
   accorded to the individual. The use of the term select with the next higher grade is not
   appropriate.
7.5. Position Precedence.
   7.5.1. There are times when position takes precedence over date of rank. The Chairman of
   the Joint Chiefs of Staff is senior to all other officers, followed by the Vice Chairman Joint
   Chiefs of Staff, then the Service Chiefs (who are ranked by their dates of appointment, with
   the Coast Guard always last). At joint functions, Combatant Commanders, ranked by date of
   appointment, are placed ahead of other general officers. They are followed by active duty
   four-stars (by date of rank), retired four-stars, active duty three-stars, retired three-stars, and
   so on.
   7.5.2. Based on their positions, the commander and vice commander of a wing normally take
   precedence over other colonels in the wing, regardless of their date of rank. Similarly, at
   MAJCOMs, the directors and chiefs of special staff take precedence over other staff officers
   of similar grade regardless of their date of rank. In addition, individual unit commanders may
   use their discretion to determine that certain other positions in the unit should take
   precedence at unit events, such as a host or guest of honor. This is determined on an
   individual, case-by-case basis.
   7.5.3. The Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF)
      7.5.3.1. The person serving as the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF) is
      accorded special precedence status in accordance with this position. In the National
      Capital Region (NCR), the CMSAF comes immediately after the Assistant Vice Chief of
 54                                 AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010


      Staff (CVA). At Joint events, the CMSAF comes before three-star generals. When at Air
      Force-only events, outside the NCR and if the CMSAF is not the guest of honor, then
      he/she is positioned after the general officers present.
      7.5.3.2. This precedence applies only to the currently serving Chief Master Sergeant of
      the Air Force. Retired Chief Master Sergeants of the Air Force should be placed in front
      of other retired chief master sergeants.
7.6. Department of Defense Civilians Order of Precedence.
   7.6.1. Senior Executive Service (SES) precedence is determined by DV codes or Priority
   Precedence codes and is based on the responsibility of the position not the pay grade held by
   a particular individual. Precedence among SES members accorded the same DV Code is
   determined by date of appointment to the Senior Executive Service. The Air Force Senior
   Executive Management Office maintains a duty roster with DV codes for senior civilians.
   Refer to their website for current information.
   7.6.2. Civilian positions above DV-4 level are Executive Level positions and encompass the
   Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF), Under Secretary of the Air Force (USecAF), Assistant
   Secretaries and the General Counsel. These positions are by presidential appointment with
   Senate confirmation.
7.7. Order of Precedence Among Elected Officials.
   7.7.1. Members of the U.S. Senate and Congress are ranked by length of continuous service.
   If this period is equal, then they are ranked by order in which their state was admitted to the
   Union or alphabetically by state.
   7.7.2. Other state and local officials are difficult to rank because there are no fixed rules
   assigning precedence. It is important to consider the purpose of the function, level of all
   guests, and political significance when determining seating arrangements or other tasks based
   on an order of precedence. When there is no definitive published guidance, it is vital that you
   keep the best interests of the Air Force and the United States in the forefront of planning and
   are consistent.
7.8. Diplomatic Precedence.
   7.8.1. Precedence for Chiefs of Missions is based upon when their credentials were
   presented. Chiefs of Missions are defined as, but not limited to, Papal nuncios, Ambassadors
   Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Ministers Plenipotentiary, and Charges d‘Affaires.
7.9. Other Rules to Consider.
   7.9.1. At a function in the U.S. to which the President has been invited but sends a
   representative, his representative is accorded the rank and courtesy that goes with the
   presidency. This is not true for other officials of the government. Their representatives are
   accorded precedence based on the position they hold.
   7.9.2. Spouses of government officials are accorded the same rank as the principals at
   official functions. They are seated accordingly unless they hold official positions themselves.
   In a case where the principal and the spouse both hold official positions, they are then placed
   in the order dictated by their official position.
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                      55


  7.9.3. Widows of former presidents have a special place in the order of precedence. A
  widow is ranked according to the seniority of the term of office held by her husband.
  7.9.4. Medal of Honor recipients do not have a precedence code except when being
  specifically honored at a dinner, ceremony, or event where the medal recipient is the guest of
  honor, or based on the their military rank.
7.10. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Proper Display of Air Force Leadership Photos for
Bulletin Boards and Displays.
  7.10.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) The intent of displaying official photos is to
  familiarize 52 FW members of the leadership. When displaying photos proper protocol
  precedence must be observed. Guidance of proper precedence may be found in AFI 34-1201,
  Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 34-1202, Guide to Protocol, and Department of Defense
  (DoD) Memorandum dated 26 Sep 08 explaining the approved DoD order of precedence.
  7.10.2. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) If a unit wishes to display the picture of the
  President of the United States they must also post the photos of those individuals leading to
  the President. In this case the pictures that would be displayed are: The President, the
  Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF), the Chief of Staff
  of the Air Force (CSAF), the Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force (CMSAF), the
  MAJCOM CC, the MAJCOM CCC, the Wing CC, the Wing CV, the Wing CCC, the Group
  CC, the Group CD, the Group Chief (CEM), the Unit/Squadron CC. Units displaying
  pictures may start at any point in the precedence line but MUST display everyone below that
  starting point (i.e., if you start at the MAJCOM/CC you must display everyone who falls
  under that point).
  7.10.3. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) At a minimum Groups and Squadrons attached to
  the 52 FW will display the following pictures; 52 FW/CC, 52 FW/CV, 52 FW/CCC. If a
  Group or Squadron wishes to display more of the command under the 52 FW/CC they may
  proceed as follows: Group/CC, Group/CD, Group/CEM, and Squadron/CC. Units below the
  squadron level will follow direction from their Squadron/CC as to whether or not to display
  photos.
  7.10.4. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Due to the 52 FW‘s uniqueness, if an organization
  wishes to display the picture of the President of the United States they will need to display all
  of the following: The President, SECDEF, SECAF, CSAF, CMSAF, United States Air
  Forces Europe (USAFE)/CC, USAFE/CCC, 3 AF/CC, 3 AF/CCC, 52 FW/CC, 52 FW/CV,
  52 FW/CCC. The organization then has the option of continuing the display as follows:
  Group/CC, Group/CD, Group/CEM, and Squadron/CC.

                                             Chapter 8

                                CUSTOMS AND COURTESIES

8.1. Hand Salutes.
   8.1.1. The hand salute is the form of greeting and recognition exchanged between persons in
   the armed services. All Air Force personnel in uniform are required to salute when they
   encounter any person or situation entitled to the salute.
       8.1.1.1. When the salute is rendered to another person, the junior member initiates the
       salute accompanied with an appropriate verbal greeting, e.g., ―Good Morning,
       Sir/Ma‘am‖. Salute and extend the verbal greeting at a distance at which recognition is
       easy and audible. Offer your salute early enough to allow the senior time to return it and
       extend a verbal greeting before you pass. All salutes received when in uniform shall be
       returned; at other times, salutes received shall be appropriately acknowledged.
       8.1.1.2. When the salute is rendered to a senior officer in a vehicle, hold the salute until
       it is returned by the officer or after the vehicle has passed.
       8.1.1.3. When reporting to a senior officer, secure permission to enter, walk to within
       two paces of the officer or desk, halt, salute and report. Hold the salute until it is returned.
       When leaving, you should, prior to departing, take one step back, render your salute,
       execute an about face and leave in a military manner.
   8.1.2. Local commanders are obligated to carefully review saluting policies for their
   installations. In areas where saluting would be highly repetitious or otherwise infeasible,
   commanders may designate the specific area(s) as a no salute or no hat, no salute area.
   8.1.3. A member not in formation but in uniform, salutes as follows:
      Who                         Where           Salute When
      United States Air Force     Outdoors        When recognized by the junior member
      Officers Senior in Rank     Indoors         When reporting in
                                  In a GOV        When distinguished by vehicle plates and/or flags
                                  In a POV        Optional
      The President and           Outdoors        When recognized by the junior member
      Vice President              In a vehicle    When distinguished by vehicle plates and/or flags
      Secretary of Defense        Outdoors        When recognized by the junior member
                                  In a vehicle    When distinguished by vehicle plates and/or flags
      Service Secretaries         Outdoors        When recognized by the junior member
                                  In a vehicle    When distinguished by vehicle plates and/or flags
      Other US Officers           Outdoors        When recognized by the junior member
      (commissioned and           In a GOV        When distinguished by vehicle plates and/or flags
      warrant) Senior in Rank
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                        57


     Officers of Friendly        Outdoors        When recognized by the junior member
     Foreign Nations

NOTE: Rendering/returning salutes is not required if either or both are in civilian attire or
have their hands full; however, a greeting such as good morning sir/ma‘am‖ is appropriate.
  8.1.4. Groups and Formations.
      8.1.4.1. In formation, members do not render or return a salute unless given the
      command to do so. The person in charge salutes and acknowledges salutes for the whole
      formation.
      8.1.4.2. In groups, but not in formation. When a senior officer approaches, the first
      individual noticing the officer calls the group to attention. All members face the officer
      and salute (when outdoors). If the officer addresses an individual or the group, all remain
      at attention (unless otherwise ordered) until the end of the conversation, at which time
      they all salute the officer (when outdoors).
      8.1.4.3. In a work detail, workers do not salute. The person in charge salutes for the
      entire detail.
  8.1.5. Persons guarding prisoners will not salute.
  8.1.6. Saluting the Flag.
      8.1.6.1. When not in formation, e.g., attendance at a parade, a salute is rendered to the
      flag as a sign of respect. This is done as the flag passes in review. Members of the Armed
      forces and veterans who are present but not in uniform may render the military salute,
      Members should stand at attention, salute six paces before the flag is even with them and
      hold their salute until the flag has passed six paces. All other stand at attention and place
      your right hand (with a hat if wearing one) over your heart.
      8.1.6.2. Flags on stationary flag staffs are only saluted during Reveille, Retreat or special
      ceremonies. If the flag is being lowered or raised or To the Colors or National Anthem is
      played, then in these cases, when outside and in uniform, face the flag (if visible) or face
      the music and stand at attention and salute on the first note of the music (or if no music,
      when you see the flag first being raised or lowered). Drop your salute after the last note is
      played, or when the flag has been fully raised or lowered, depending on the ceremony
      (during the playing of ‗Sound retreat‖ which precedes the lowering of the flag, stand at
      Parade Rest). If in a vehicle during Reveille (if the flag is being raised) or Retreat, pull
      the car to the side of the road and stop. All occupants sit quietly at attention until the last
      note of the music has played or the flag is fully raised or lowered. All sporting or physical
      training actives will stop during Reveille (if the flag is being raised) and Retreat with
      proper honors to flag being showed. Members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are
      present but not in uniform may render the military salute when outdoors. This is true for
      hoisting, lowering or passing of the Unites States Flag and the National Anthem. All
      other stand at attention and place your right hand (with a hat if wearing one) over your
      heart. If your base flies the U.S. flag a continuous 24-hours and no music but reveille is
      played with no action with the flag you are not required to stop and salute, reveille is just
      a bugle call. For retreat is much the same as for reveille, retreat is just a bugle call but
 58                                  AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010


       even if the flag is not being lowered it is playing of the National Anthem or ―To the
       Colors‖ that requires proper honors to be displayed to the flag.
       8.1.6.3. The ceremonial occasions when the salute is rendered, outdoors only, include the
       passing of the uncased Colors, the playing of honors music, the national Anthem of any
       nation, or ―to the Colors‖.
       8.1.6.4. When indoors and in uniform, face the flag (or the music if the flag is not
       visible) and stand at attention when the National Anthem (of any country) or ―To the
       Colors‖ is played (do not place your hand over your heart). There are two exceptions. If
       you are in uniform, under arms, you salute. The other rule is when you‘re a spectator in
       uniform at a military ceremony inside where ―outdoor‖ rules apply. A good example is
       when a change of command ceremony planned for outdoors is moved inside a hanger due
       to inclement weather. When indoors and in civilian clothes, face the flag (or the music if
       the flag is not visible), stand at attention when the National Anthem (of any country) or
       ―To the Colors‖ is played and place your hand over your heart.
       8.1.6.5. When at a military funeral in uniform, salute the caisson or hearse as it passes
       and the casket as it is carried by your position. You should also salute during the firing of
       volleys and the playing of Taps.
   8.1.7. When at a military funeral in uniform, salute the caisson or hearse as it passes and the
   casket as it is carried by your position. You should also salute during the firing of volleys and
   the playing of Taps.
8.2. Other Marks of Respect.
   8.2.1. Juniors shall show deference to seniors at all times by recognizing their presence and
   by employing a courteous and respectful bearing and mode of speech toward them.
   8.2.2. Juniors shall stand at attention (unless seated at mess or unless circumstances make
   such action impracticable or inappropriate) as follows:
       8.2.2.1. When addressed by an officer senior to them.
       8.2.2.2. When an officer of flag or general rank, the commanding officer, or an officer
       senior to the commanding officer, or an officer making an official inspection enters the
       room or space.
   8.2.3. Juniors shall walk or ride to the left of seniors whom they are accompanying.
   8.2.4. Officers shall enter aircraft and other modes of transportation in inverse order of rank
   and shall depart them in order of rank, unless there is special reason to the contrary. The
   seniors shall be accorded the more desirable seats.
8.3. Making a Proper Introduction. When introducing two individuals, mention the honored
or senior person first, e.g. General Smith, I would like to introduce to you, Captain John Jones;
Captain Jones, General Smith. Please note, proper etiquette suggests using, introduce to you, not
introduce you to. It is always appropriate to explain to the senior person where the junior person
is assigned.
8.4. Courtesies to the Air Force Song.
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                  59


  8.4.1. When the Air Force Song is played, it is customary to stand, clap and join in singing
  as direct by the nature of the ceremony. Do not salute. The Official Party may move after the
  playing of the first verse of the Air Force song. Proper respect and courtesy is always to be
  rendered to sister service songs by coming to the proper form of attention.

                                            Chapter 11

                                          FLIGHT LINE

11.1. Security/Flight Line Access Requirements.
   11.1.1. Flight Line Access and Procedures. Access to most flight lines is restricted, and
   procedures vary from flight line to flight line. Most flight lines require a flight line certificate
   of competency and a line badge to gain access. Check with your local security forces and
   base operations for a complete list of rules and requirements. (Refer to AFI 13-213, Airfield
   Management; AFI 13-202, Overdue Aircraft; and AFOSH Std 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line
   Operations and Ground Operations and Activities.)
   11.1.2. Customs/Immigration. If the DV is arriving from out of country, check with base
   operations to see if there are any special requirements for processing passengers and
   offloading the aircraft.
   11.1.3. Local Policy. For detailed information, see the local guidelines maintained by the
   installation safety office.
11.2. Safety. Safety is the number one issue and should be considered above all else. Safety
rules should NEVER be compromised simply for expediency.
   11.2.1. Red Lines. On the flight line, identify secure areas and ensure they are never crossed
   except at appropriate entry control points (ECP) with proper clearance for the area.
   11.2.2. Foreign Object Damage (FOD). Debris could cause damage to aircraft if driven over
   or ingested into an engine. Every time a vehicle is driven onto the airfield surface, the driver
   must stop at a designated entry point and check all tires for foreign objects in the treads and
   under the wheel wells. Foreign objects must be removed and properly disposed of before
   proceeding. Furthermore, retrieve and properly dispose of FOD seen while on the flight line.
   11.2.3. Hats are not normally worn on the flight line; however, it is common for DV greeters
   and the greeting party to wear hats when greeting high ranking personnel. All members of the
   official greeting party and all others assisting should follow suit.
   11.2.4. Ear Plugs must be available and worn when appropriate. Base operations will
   normally assist is supplying these for all participating members and passengers.
   11.2.5. Ramp Freeze. Airfield management may call a ramp freeze 15 minutes prior to
   arrival or departure of a four star general or higher. The freeze does not apply to vehicles
   which normally operate on the airfield. All vehicles not supporting the arrival/departure
   should be kept clear of the primary DV parking spot anytime an aircraft and gathering
   personnel are present.
11.3. Communication. It is imperative to have a list of contact numbers on hand and means to
communicate. The minimum contacts required for quick reference include but are not limited to:
base operations, command post, air transportation operations center (ATOC), transient alert
(TA), passenger terminal, security forces, transportation, aircrew and the customs/immigration
representative, if applicable.
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                        63


11.4. Manifest Passengers. Obtain a complete list of passengers for arrivals. Many times initial
reports will only list the senior DV. It is important to be prepared for the possibility of multiple
DVs disembarking an aircraft. Determine whether or not the DV will be disembarking the
aircraft and, if not, determine their destination. Base operations is generally the primary point to
get the needed information. They may not have the information themselves but can normally
initiate the steps to get it. Be proactive and, if necessary, notify the receiving base for transient
DVs.
11.5. Checklist. A local checklist for each specific flight line should be assembled based on
local policies, procedures and commander preferences. This is a quick reference to ensure
adequate preparation.
11.6. Equipment. Ensure any special equipment for special aircraft such as high lift or lighted
stairs, baggage conveyor or generators are readily available. Generally, TA or aircraft
maintenance will have these ready and in place, but it is important to confirm.
11.7. DV Lounge. Use common sense as to what the DV lounge will require depending on the
type of DV, how long they have traveled, and where they are coming from or going to. You
should also consider what they are planning to do while they are there.
   11.7.1. Water and Refreshments. Ensure water is potable and palatable and if possible cold.
   Other refreshments such as coffee or snacks should be fresh and appropriate.
   11.7.2. Restrooms. Provide clean and serviceable restrooms.
   11.7.3. Communication.
       11.7.3.1. Phones. Local, long distance, and DSN should be available.
       11.7.3.2. STU should be available, but secure as per local procedures. Provide a key if
       necessary.
       11.7.3.3. Office equipment. Computer connectivity (docking station, keyboard, mouse,
       printer are beneficial to have), fax, copier, and printer.
       11.7.3.4. Amenities. The DV lounge should be comfortable, clean, and air conditioned.
       Television, music, decorations, and flowers are nice to have and should be considered
       depending on the visitor, situation and local availability. Nonappropriated funds must not
       be used to stock the food/ drink amenities.
       11.7.3.5. Marquee or welcome boards. Ensure contents of welcome board are
       appropriate, correct and up to date. Verify the customs of foreign visitors. If there is an
       elevated security risk, check with local security and OSI to be sure the marquee does not
       increase the DV‘s security risk.
11.8. Flight Status. Keep abreast of departure, arrival time and aircraft status. Command post,
base operations and ATOC provide assistance with this information. Keep the commander, DV
greeter and anyone with a need to know informed of any changes in arrival time. Be sure the
greeting party will be able to be on the flight line in plenty of time. A very useful resource is
USTRANSCOM‘s Single Mobility System (SMS). It is a secure website where you can track the
flight status of registered flights. To sign up, log onto the SMS website at
https://sms.transcom.mil/ and register.
 64                                    AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010


11.9. Aircraft Parking. Check with TA, aircraft maintenance or base operations as appropriate
to determine where the aircraft is or will be parked. Go to the area to ensure arrival/departure
location is clean and safe. If it is an arriving aircraft, be sure there is not already an aircraft
parked in the assigned spot. For a departing aircraft, ensure aircraft is in the appropriate parking
spot, it is the appropriate type of aircraft, the tail number matches the manifest and that it is not
obviously unserviceable. Contact base operations or TA if there are any discrepancies.
11.10. Vehicle Positioning. DV transportation should be parked in a designated area. If in
doubt, verify with base operations or TA. The first vehicle in line is that of the senior ranking
DV. If flight line access is permitted, the vehicle will drive up on the left side of the aircraft from
the rear, once TA has indicated it is safe to approach. Verify the direction the aircraft will be
parked and validate the location of the exit doors.
11.11. Public Affairs. Notify PA so they can be available and determine what, if any, type of
media is required.
11.12. Customs and Courtesies. When hosting DVs, plan and execute to reflect the
professionalism of Air Force members and honor customs, courtesies and traditions of the United
States Air Force. At all times and occasions, appropriate honors and courtesies are to be
extended with due deference to position, title, and rank precedence. Requirements for saluting
may differ from base to base depending on command and operational activity. Members of a
formal greeting party always salute the arrival and departure of an aircraft carrying a DV for
whom saluting is appropriate (see Chapter 8). Saluting is normally required around the base
operations building, the passenger terminal, and similar locations. Saluting is not normally
required in aircraft parking areas, areas designated for aircraft maintenance, aircraft static
displays, or an aircraft alert hangar area. Regardless of the location on a flight line, if the
situation appears appropriate for saluting, salute. It is an expected courtesy. "When in doubt,
salute."
11.13. Red Carpet. If used, the red carpet (or red carpet painted on the pavement) is located at
the primary DV parking spot. Pavement markings should be placed in the transient DV parking
area to allow TA to position the aircraft appropriately and align the door with the red carpet.
11.14. Safety. Do not approach the aircraft until it has come to a complete stop, engines have
shut down, and door has opened; or until movement is directed by ATOC or TA personnel on
site.
11.15. Greeting Party. Identify members greeting the DVs early, review arrival/departure
customs and courtesies and be sure they are knowledgeable of the itinerary and have necessary
transportation. They should be familiar with the DV lounge and other readily available facilities.
Installation commanders establish local guidelines defining specific procedures in this area. The
greeting party should be briefed by the protocol officer on line-up positions. Greeters line up
right to left facing the door side of the aircraft. The senior ranking individual stands to the far
right as the plane pulls onto the flight line and into the parking spot. Spouses stand to the left of
their respective principal. At their discretion, the senior greeter commands, present arms as the
aircraft approaches. Once the aircraft has stopped, the senior greeter commands, order arms.
(Figure 11.1).
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                    65


   11.15.1. If the DV is a civilian, no salute is required, unless it is the President or Vice
   President of the United States, Secretary of Defense or any of the Service Secretaries. Stand
   at attention until the aircraft comes to a stop.
   11.15.2. If there are civilians in the greeting party, they do not salute, but stand in a
   respectful manner with arms to their sides.
   11.15.3. Once the engine has been cut off and the wheels are chocked, the senior ranking
   person takes the lead and the greeting party lines up at the aircraft‘s door.
   11.15.4. As members of the arriving party exit the aircraft, the senior officer and members of
   the arrival party step forward to greet the individual(s) and move them quickly to their
   vehicles.
   11.15.5. When customs/immigrations are required, they enter the aircraft before the
   passengers disembark.

Figure 11.1. Greeting Party Positioning.




11.16. Transportation.
   11.16.1. Placing Vehicles.
      11.16.1.1. Move vehicles into place only after aircraft engines are cut off and wheels are
      chocked.
      11.16.1.2. When driving across yellow lines, the driver side should be nearest to the
      aircraft. However, the passenger side of car should be closest during loading.
 66                                  AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010


       11.16.1.3. A spotter is required when backing up to the aircraft.
       11.16.1.4. The vehicle transporting the senior ranking DV will be in the lead position.
       11.16.1.5. Security vehicles may be required, depending on threat level, otherwise they
       are optional. If included in the motorcade, they will become the lead and trailing vehicles.
       This will ensure timely movement and not allow other vehicles to interfere with the
       motorcade. In addition, control points may be used to expedite traffic flow.
11.17. Seating. The seat of honor is on the rear passenger side. (See Figure 11.2) Consider
aide-de-camp and personal security officers when planning vehicle seating.

Figure 11.2. Vehicle Seating.




11.18. Luggage.
   11.18.1. Use a separate vehicle for luggage. Do not make the DV wait while luggage is
   being off-loaded. A detail may be required if there is a large amount of luggage.
   11.18.2. Provide a covered vehicle for inclement weather.
   11.18.3. Be prepared for possible security, customs, or agriculture inspections.
   11.18.4. Ensure luggage is properly and easily identifiable.
   11.18.5. Plan for delivery.
11.19. Aircraft Preparation. (See 11.9 Aircraft Parking) Check to be sure aircraft is serviced,
ready, and the flight crew is standing by. Make sure stairs are available if it is a large aircraft.
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                            67


11.20. Weather. During times of uncertain weather, it is a good idea to have a contingency plan
in the event the aircraft is unable to depart. This may include lodging reservations or backup DV
transportation depending on the situation. If inclement weather, bring an umbrella.
11.21. Farewell Party. Rules are basically the same as greeting party, but in reverse, i.e.
marquee message, ear plugs, etc. Generally, the baggage will arrive and load before the
passengers. If there are any space-available passengers who have been approved by the senior
DV for travel, they will be loaded prior to the arrival of the DV. The DV will generally be the
last on the aircraft and the first off of the aircraft. If waved off by the DV, the farewell party may
depart, but the protocol officer should remain nearby ‘til wheels are up.‖
11.22. Salute. The senior officer will give the command for the salute when the aircraft starts
rolling. Salute will be held until the aircraft makes its first turn for departure or the entire aircraft
passes the farewell party. If the DV returns the salute or flashes his window shutter, the senior
member of the farewell party may command, "order arms".
11.23. Flight Line Ceremony If a flight line ceremony is required, keep the event as simple as
possible by minimizing the requirements. Depending on the event, honor guard and music may
be required. If playing musical honors, the official party should hold in place at the top of cordon
by the aircraft for playing of musical honors. Once musical honors are completed, the official
party should proceed as required. It is important to note that the official party should not be
moving during the playing of musical honors. See Attachment 2 for appropriate honors and
flags.

                                           Chapter 12

                             DISTINGUISHED VISITORS (DVS)

12.1. Definition of a Distinguished Visitor (DV). A DV is defined as (1) any general or flag
officer; (2) any government official with rank equivalent to a brigadier general or higher; or (3)
any foreign military officer or civilian designated a DV by the Under Secretary of the Air Force
for International Affairs (SAF/ IA). At times, persons of lower rank but appointed to or filling
certain positions, may be accorded DV status. The purpose of the visit will determine if the
distinction of DV should be accorded. The commander determines the DV distinction on an
individual basis.
12.2. Honors Accorded DVs. The intent of honors is to extend a mark of courtesy, respect and
recognition to a distinguished person (honors will be accorded only to the distinguished person
and not to his/her personal representative). Honors are usually demonstrated through the use of
cannon salutes, escort of honor or honor guard, parades or review of operations, ruffles and
flourishes. See Attachment 2 for a list persons entitled to honors, together with the number of
guns, ruffles and flourishes, and the prescribed music for each.
   12.2.1. In general, honors and ceremonies are reserved for the President, Vice President,
   statutory appointees, and general or flag officers of the United States military establishment,
   international dignitaries, and for occasions when such ceremonies promote international
   goodwill.
   12.2.2. International civilian and military officials, occupying positions equivalent to those
   listed at Attachment 10, will be rendered equivalent honors to which the United States
   official is entitled, regardless of actual military rank. All other foreign military persons will
   receive the honors due their actual rank or its United States Air Force equivalent.
12.3. Minimizing Frequency of Ceremonial Honors.
   12.3.1. Nothing in this instruction should be construed as discouraging formal welcoming
   ceremonies when planned by appropriate authority for specific purposes. These are always
   appropriate when they are instrumental in improving morale or maintaining national prestige.
   12.3.2. In the interest of economy and manning, parades, honor cordons, motorcades, and
   other ceremonies, which involve large number of personnel and equipment, will be held to an
   absolute minimum when officials entitled to such honors visit military installations. In
   general, full honors will be reserved for statutory appointees and general or flag officers of
   the military services, for foreign dignitaries, and for occasions when ceremonies promote
   international good will. It is the prerogative of the commander to determine types of honors
   to be rendered.
   12.3.3. Officials of the Department of the Air Force entitled to ceremonial honors will advise
   the appropriate commander of impending official visits. Notification will include adequate
   advance notice, the general purpose of the visit, and particular items or areas of interest to the
   visitor. Such officials will also notify the commander that ceremonies will be dispensed with
   unless for compelling reasons they support or enhance the purpose of the visit. All visitors
   are encouraged to decline routine honors unless the ceremony serves a useful purpose that
   benefits the nation, the Air Force, the installation or community good will. Officials of the
 70                                 AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010


   Department of Defense and other military departments are also expected to support this
   practice. Commanders who receive requests to omit honors or ceremonies will comply with
   such requests unless special local circumstances indicate that it is in the best interest of the
   Air Force or community relations to render honors. If this is the case, the commander will
   advise the visitor.
12.4. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Handling Distinguished Visitor (DV) Visits and Wing
Events.
   12.4.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) 52 FW/CCP is the first coordination point for all
   DV visits and command-level events at SAB, Bitburg Annex, and geographically separated
   units. The office of primary responsibility for visits and events will appoint a project and/or
   escort officer who will complete arrangements and coordinate all activities with the
   appropriate offices, beginning with 52 FW/CCP.
   12.4.2. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Upon notification that your unit has a DV visit
   approaching, the point of contact (POC) must contact 52 FW/CCP and discuss the sequence
   of events that must occur for a successful visit. Due to operation security (OPSEC) concerns
   on certain DVs, all General Officer‘s names and duty titles should be treated as For Official
   Use Only or Classified and, therefore, coded. This rule of thumb also applies to civilian DVs
   who are equivalent to or above a General Officer. Upon notifying 52 FW/CCP, the
   determination will be made as to what OPSEC guidelines will be observed for the visit.
   12.4.3. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Upon notification that your unit has a Wing level
   event (i.e. Change of Command); the POC will contact 52 FW/CCP and discuss the sequence
   of events that must occur for a successful event. 52 FW/CCP will guide the POC using
   example checklists and supervision in the creation of all documents needed for the event as
   well as ensuring the event is executed in an appropriate fashion.
   12.4.4. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) For visits or events, the duties of the project/escort
   officer will vary greatly depending on the circumstances. It is the responsibility of 52
   FW/CCP to ensure that the POC is provided all the information and examples that they need
   in order to successfully complete the visit or event. For further information as well as
   examples and templates, visit the Protocol Portal page at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-
   af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=-1743442 . Proactive and open communication
   between the POC and 52 FW/CCP will result in success.
12.5. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) DV Lodging.
   12.5.1. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) This section establishes guidelines for reserving a
   DV Suite located in the Eifel Arms Inn Annex, Bldg 38, on SAB. The 52 FW/CCP manages
   six DV suites (rooms 201-206), and all reservations must be made through 52 FW/CCP.
   12.5.2. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) For the purposes of DV lodging, DVs are officers
   in the grade of O-6 and above; civilians in the grade of GS-15or equivalent and above;
   enlisted members in the grade of E-9; and equal ranks of other branches of service. DV
   suites are primarily intended for use by authorized personnel on official business at SAB. All
   other personnel (DV aide-de-camps, guests, etc.) below the authorized grades are authorized
   a DV suite on a space-available basis.
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                  71


  12.5.3. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Contact 52 FW/CCP at DSN 452-6057,
  Commercial 06565-61-6057, to reserve a suite as soon as you know a room will be needed.
  Provide a point of contact name and phone number, as well as the title, rank, and name of the
  DV, and the dates that the suite will be required to secure the room. If a late arrival is
  required (check-in after 1800) a credit card number must be provided to lodging to secure the
  room. 52FW/CCP will contact lodging to confirm the reservation and forward an email
  confirmation of the reservation to the POC. In the event of a short-notice reservation, after
  duty hours (1700) or on weekends, contact lodging directly at DSN 452-0500 or Commercial
  06565-61-0500 and follow-up with 52 FW/CCP on the next duty day.
  12.5.4. (Added-SPANGDAHLEMAB) Space-available, same-day lodging may be
  available after 1800 hours on a day-to-day and first-come-first-served basis. Lodging will
  coordinate afterwards with 52 FW/CCP on all DV Suite usage.

                                       CONFERENCES

13.1. Overview. Protocol may be asked to manage or support conferences, workshops, and
seminars. These will range in complexity from a single half-day working session to perhaps a
week-long event, with several social functions. Normally protocol involvement will be focused
on supporting social events and ensuring certain logistics matters have been handled (lodging,
transportation, meals and socials, etc.). For large conferences, the commander should appoint an
office of primary responsibility (OPR) to lead the effort and make sure all arrangements are
made.
13.2. References. See Air Force Pamphlet 34-1202, Guide to Protocol, Chapter 13, for
descriptions of the activities and arrangements common to most conferences. All of these factors
may not apply in your situation. Refer to other chapters for details on how to prepare for specific
events.

A2.1. In place of gun salutes/rifle volleys, the number of aircraft in a memorial fly-over or the
number of persons in the honor cordon indicates the type of honors being accorded. The numbers
in the ―honor cordon‖ column include the commander and Airmen, but do not include additional
flights used for the Presidential ceremonies, or on special occasions the installation commander
considers appropriate.
A2.2. The music indicated below follows ruffles and flourishes without pause. Unless
otherwise directed, civilian officials of the DoD and military departments receive the last musical
strain (32 bars) of ―The Stars and Stripes Forever.‖ The person receiving musical honors
acknowledges honors throughout the playing by saluting when wearing uniform hats for the
event.
A2.3. Per the chart below, the only civilians to retain honors upon departure from office are
former Presidents of the United States. They will continue to be introduced, however, as ―the
Honorable‖ for the remainder of their life.

NOTES:
1. The same number of honor cordon members are provided on departure as on arrival.
2. The United States Navy Band arrangement of the National Anthem and the United States Marine
Corps Band arrangement of ―Hail to the Chief‖ are the official DoD arrangements to be played by all
service bands on appropriate occasions.
3. The traditional musical selection ―Hail to the Chief‖ is designated as a musical tribute to the
President of the United States; as such, it will not be performed by military musical organizations as a
tribute to other dignitaries. Performances of this selection are subject to:
  a. During ―Hail to the Chief‖ by military musical organizations, military personnel in uniform
  (other than band personnel) will accord the same honor as for the National Anthem or ―To the
  Colors.‖
  b. If, in the course of any ceremony, honors must be performed more than once, ―Hail to the Chief‖
  may be used interchangeably with the National Anthem as honors to the President of the United
  States.
  c. When specified by the President, the Secretary of State, the Chief of the Secret Service, or an
  authorized representative, ―Hail to the Chief‖ may be used as an opportunity for the President and
  immediate party to move to or from their places while all others stand fast.
  d. During a State Funeral for a former President of the United States, ―Hail to the Chief‖ is

6. Appropriate background music is any music such as a national air or a folk song favorably
associated with the distinguished person or his country. If no such music is known or available, any
good-sounding music of universal appeal and propriety may be used. All music performed as
background should be appropriately subdued to the principal action.
7. Appropriate inspection music may be in any meter and played so it would not require the
inspection party to conform to its cadence.

STATES




FLAG FOLDING CEREMONY – AIR FORCE SCRIPT
For more than 200 years, the American flag has been the symbol of our nation’s unity, as
well as a source of pride and inspiration for millions of citizens.
Born on June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress determined that the flag of the
United States be thirteen stripes, alternating between seven red and six white; and that the
union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation. (1)
Between 1777 and 1960, the shape and design of the flag evolved into the flag presented
before you today. The 13 horizontal stripes represent the original 13 colonies, while the
stars represent the 50 states of the Union. The colors of the flag are symbolic as well; red
symbolizes hardiness and valor; white signifies purity and innocence; and blue represents
vigilance, perseverance and justice. (1)
AFI34-1201_SPANGDAHLEMABSUP_I 19 JULY 2010                                                    89



Traditionally, a symbol of liberty, the American flag has carried the message of freedom,
and inspired Americans, both at home and abroad.
In 1814, Francis Scott Key was so moved at seeing the Stars and Stripes waving after the
British shelling of Baltimore’s Fort McHenry that he wrote the words to The Star
Spangled Banner. (3)
In 1892 the flag inspired Francis Bellamy to write the ―Pledge of Allegiance,‖ our most
famous flag salute and patriotic oath. (3)
In July 1969 the American flag was ―flown‖ in space when Neil Armstrong planted it on the
surface of the moon. (3)
Today, our flag flies on constellations of Air Force satellites that circle our globe, and on the
fin flash of our aircraft in harms way in every corner of the world. Indeed, it flies in the
heart of every Airman who serves our great Nation. The sun never sets on our US Air
Force, nor on the flag we so proudly cherish. (3)
Since 1776 no generation of Americans has been spared the responsibility of defending
freedom Today’s Airmen remain committed to preserving the freedom that others won for
us, for generations to come.
By displaying the flag, and giving it a distinctive fold we show respect to the flag, and
express our gratitude to those individuals who fought, and continue to fight for freedom,
                                                  th
at home and abroad. Since the dawn of the 20 century, Airmen have proudly flown the
flag in every major conflict on lands and skies around the world. It is their responsibility
our responsibility to continue to protect and preserve the rights, privileges and freedoms
that we, as Americans, enjoy today.
The United States flag represents who we are. It stands for the freedom we all share and
the pride and patriotism we feel for our country. We cherish its legacy, as a beacon of
hope to one and all. Long may it wave.
