   aboard a commercial carrier for shipments consigned to this station:
2                                                                  TRAVISAFBI24-102 15 JUNE 2001


    2.2. Less-than-Truckload (LTL) Shipments. The receiving agency will accomplish unloading of
    delivery vehicles diverted to its facility with the least possible delay. Unloading should be completed
    within two hours after spotting LTL shipments.
    2.3. Truckload Shipments. Receiving agency will affect unloading with least possible delay with a
    maximum time limit of two hours after truck is in place.
    2.4. Ammunition and Petroleum Officers. Receiving agencies in ammunition and petroleum sec-
    tions are responsible for assigning personnel from within their sections to unload and check all incom-
    ing shipments marked for them for correct amounts, weights, shortages, overages, and damages. They
    will ensure that all receipted freight bills with required receiving form (AMC Form 369, Shipment
    Tally) and the certificate required by paragraph 2.5. (when applicable) are turned over to the Traffic
    Management Flight (TMF) no later than one working day from date of receipt of each shipment.
    2.5. In the event truckload unloading is not completed within specified time limits due to the fault of
    the receiving agency, the responsible agency representative will furnish a certificate to TMF indicat-
    ing the cause for delay to support the payment of detention. Under no circumstances will the receiving
    agency certify delays on any carrier paperwork.
    2.6. Discrepancies in shipment. All assigned or attached units are responsible for rendering required
    assistance for processing freight loss and damage claims when requested by the Chief, Traffic Man-
    agement Flight or designated traffic technicians.

3. RESPONSIBILITY:
    3.1. Designated freight in-checkers at any base activity (e.g., FB, FE, and FY for base supply, FM for
    medical supply, etc.) which receives material directly from a carrier will examine and count all con-
    tainers and pieces received in each shipment. Each item will be checked as it is being unloaded to
    record any overage, shortage, or damage.
    3.2. When containers show evidence of damage or pilferage, let the driver know and notify TMF
    immediately. After release from the TMF representative, the receiving agency will segregate damaged
    items from other items unloaded to ensure that a proper record is made and have the carrier sign deliv-
    ery receipt indicating damage or pilferage.
    3.3. Place commingled cargo off-loaded at base supply central receiving in a designated TMF holding
    area for disposition by TMF personnel.
    3.4. Keep a record of count and condition of material when shipment is in-checked. This record will
    show shipment identification, carrier equipment number, time, date, seal number, condition of seals,
    and checker’s name. Consignee’s copy of bill of lading, a tally sheet, or other approved form will be
    used for this purpose.
    3.5. Should there be insufficient space on the delivery receipt, initiate AMC Form 369, Shipment
    Tally, or automated equivalent to provide the necessary information for marking on the shipment to
    include the Government Bill of Lading (GBL) number or Commercial Bill of Lading (CBL) number,
    if known. The following symbols will be annotated on transportation documents used for tally counts:
    3.6. For containers received intact, record the appropriate package count with a check mark.
       3.6.1. Record item shortages with an “S”. Identify the shortage with the actual package number,
       weight, and TCN for the missing item, when known.
