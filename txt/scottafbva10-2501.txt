                         TORNADO SAFETY RULES
WHEN A TORNADO WATCH IS ANNOUNCED. Conditions are favorable for a tornado to form.
Expect heavy rains, hail, and high winds.

1. Keep the radio/television on and listen for the latest weather information. If power fails, use battery-powered
radio.

2. Keep watching the sky especially from the west or southwest.

WHEN A TORNADO WARNING IS ANNOUNCED. A tornado has been sighted in the area.
Scott AFB will only sound the Base Siren System when a tornado threatens the base. The surrounding
communities will sound their sirens when a tornado warning is issued by the National Weather Service for
St. Clair County.

1. Seek protection immediately! There are no designated severe weather shelters on Scott AFB. Personnel
utilizing the FAMCAMP area may take refuge in the concrete bath house, Bldg 6400.

2. Go to your basement. If your home has no basement, take cover under heavy furniture on the ground floor in
the center part of the house or in a small room on the ground floor that is away from outside walls and windows.
As a last resort, go outside and lie flat in the nearest ditch, excavation, culvert, or ravine.

3. DO NOT TRY TO OUTRUN A TORNADO IN YOUR CAR! Find a safe place and get out of your car.
Take cover under an overpass, in a ditch, culvert, excavation, or ravine. As a last resort, lie in the nearest
depression.

4. Avoid auditoriums and gymnasiums with large, poorly supported roofs.

5. Shopping Malls - go to a designated protective shelter, not a parked car.

6. Office Buildings - go to an interior hallway on the lowest floor, away from doors or windows.

7. Disaster Supplies. Prepare for several days without outside help. Prepare for damage to phone, electricity,
water, and natural gas lines.
    First aid kit                                       Flashlights
    Food and bottled water                              Battery operated radio
    Other items such as camping supplies                Spare batteries
