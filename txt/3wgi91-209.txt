This instruction implements AFPD 91-2, Safety Programs, and provides procedures for the
storage, handling, and transportation of Tier II, wartime, explosive items for the purpose of
mobility processing under contingency operations through the joint mobility complex (JMC),
Building 15510. This instruction outlines requirements mandated by the Department of Defense
Explosive Safety Board (DDESB) in Explosive Site Plan 00-S02 Tier II. These procedures are
mandatory and deviations will not be permitted. This instruction is designed to assist
commanders and Army personnel at Elmendorf AFB in developing and managing a unit level
Explosive Safety Mishap Prevention Program. All commanders should ensure each subordinate
commander, staff officer, supervisor, and individual with operations involving explosives
continuously reviews, recognizes, and enforces mishap prevention techniques, procedures, and
requirements. This instruction is not intended to be an all-encompassing text to take the place of
Air Force manuals, Army manuals, instructions, or technical orders. However, it should serve as
a guide and a ready reference for basic information to develop, direct, and enhance your
explosive safety program. Copies of the explosive operation pre-task safety briefing,
evacuation/personnel holding area maps, minimum withdrawal distances, and checklist are
available through the 3rd Wing Weapons Safety office. This publication does not apply to the
US Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units and members. Refer recommended changes
and questions about this publication to the OPR (see Attachment 1) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication. Route the AF Form 847 through the appropriate
chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this
publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363,
Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with Air Force Records Information

1. General Policy and Responsibility.
    1.1. Explosive safety standards are an extension of the will of CONGRESS and have the
    power of law. The DDESB establishes explosives safety policy through DoD 6055.9, DoD
    Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) and DoD Component Explosives Safety Responsibilities..
    1.2. The Air Force provides explosives safety guidance in AFMAN 91-201, Explosive Safety
    Standards. This manual is an extension of DoD 6055.9 and provides further guidance for Air
    Force specific explosive safety issues.
    1.3. The 3 WG/CC is responsible for ensuring all known rules are followed within his/her
    command. The 3rd Wing Weapons Safety office assists him/her in these endeavors and must
    ensure compliance with all known explosive safety standards.
2. Operating Procedures.
    2.1. All Army personnel involved with the deployment are responsible for understanding
    and strictly observing all safety standards, requirements and precautions for the safe handling
    of explosives. Supervisors will act positively to eliminate any potential accident hazards
    existing in the operation. Commanders and supervisors are responsible for ensuring the
    compensatory measures mandated by DDESB in ESP 00-S02, Tier II are followed.
    2.2. The Army will provide the 3rd Wing 24-hour notice prior to any deployment requiring
    the processing of HC/D 1.1/1.2 munitions. Contact with the Wing Safety Office and the
    JMC will be accomplished through the Wing Command Post at DSN 317-552-3000. The 3rd
    Wing will then evacuate all non-related personnel and aircraft, and complete the JMC Tier II
    Checklist. Once evacuation is complete, the Army will transport only the required munitions
    for each chalk to the JMC, and only when the deploying aircraft is on the ground.
    2.3. Use of ESP PACAF-Elmendorf 00-S2 Tier II with ammunition and explosives is not
    authorized for training.
3. Explosive Limits, Hazard Class/Division.
    3.1. Explosives in Building 15510 (JMC) are confined to the parachute issue room and
    personnel holding area. They are limited to 3,200 pounds net explosive weight (NEW) of
    Hazard Division (HD) 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 explosives collectively, and operational requirements
    of HD 1.4 explosives. Inhabited building distance (IBD) is 1,250 feet.
    3.2. The area encompassed by the IBD arc must be cleared of unrelated personnel and
    equipment, including non-related aircraft, before the arrival of explosives. Personnel and
    traffic not associated with deployment or mobility processing of US Army forces are not
    authorized within IBD when explosives are present. Use maps (3 WG/SEW) to identify all
    facilities and aircraft parking spots that must be evacuated prior to the arrival of explosives.
4. Personnel Limits.
    4.1. Personnel issued basic load ammunition or explosives of HD 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3 explosives
    are restricted to the area identified in the personnel holding area and must proceed directly to
    transporting aircraft, as scheduled. See maps (3 WG/SEW) for personnel holding area.
3WGI91-209 7 NOVEMBER 2003                                                                      3


   4.2. If personnel with ammunition or explosives must leave the personnel holding area for
   any reason other than an emergency or to the transport aircraft, the ammunition and
   explosives must be returned to the parachute issue room.
5. Operating Locations. The parachute issue room and personnel holding area in Building
15510.
6. Safety Requirements.
   6.1. Ensure two each 2A:10BC fire extinguishers are readily available and serviceable.
   6.2. Remove rings, watches, and jewelry in accordance with in accordance with AFOSH 91-
   66, General Industrial Operations, and 91-100, Aircraft Flight Line - Ground Operations

   317-552-4681/ 6855.
   6.6. Report the highest fire/chemical symbol to the Fire Alarm Communication Center
   (FACC) at DSN 317-552-2801 anytime munitions are delivered, removed or the fire symbol
   changes. The only way to get the proper fire/chemical symbol is to look up the National
   Stock Number (NSN) up in TO 11A-1-46, Fire Fighting Guidance, Transportation and
   Storage Management Data. This TO can be downloaded from the following web site after
   obtaining a password: http://ammo.hill.af.mil/wm/new_techorder/to_list.cfm.
