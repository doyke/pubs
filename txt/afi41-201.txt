   management of alerts and recalls, Biomedical Maintenance Activities will use the following
   sources: Alerts Tracker® from ECRI Institute, Medical Materiel Quality Control (MMQC),
   AFMOA/SGAL generated quality assurance (QA) messages for AF-unique materiel, and
   direct sources such as the FDA, Prime Vendors/manufacturers, etc. (T-0, FDA)
   2.23.2. Upon initial assignment to a unit, BMETs must update their ECRI Institute website
   profile. If BMETs do not have a profile, they must create a profile and register for the Alerts
   Tracker® program. Instructions on registration and use of the Alerts Tracker® application
   can be found on the AFML website in the document library labeled as Alerts Tracker®
   Quick Start Guide. (T-0, FDA)
   2.23.3. The following are the classes of medical device recalls.
      2.23.3.1. Class I: A situation with a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure
      to, a product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death. Suspend these
      items from use until the item has been repaired or modified to correct the described
      problem.
      2.23.3.2. Class II: A situation in which the use of, or exposure to, a product may cause
      temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability
      of serious adverse health consequences is remote. Class II recalls are not generally
      serious enough to warrant suspension of the item until corrected.
      2.23.3.3. Class III: A situation in which the use of, or exposure to, a product is not likely
      to cause adverse health consequences. Class III recalls are not generally considered
      serious enough to warrant suspension of the item until corrected.
   2.23.4. BMETs will treat and document recalls that affect an item within the inventory as a
   quality assurance work order within DMLSS. After completing the recall procedures,
   BMETs document the equipment notes with the Alerts Tracker® accession number, and any
   other relevant information. (T-0, FDA)

      permit number or address, transporter’s name, and transporter’s state permit or address.
      (T-3)
5.17. Energy Conservation Planning.
   5.17.1. The AFMSA/SG8F Facilities Operations and Engineering Branch Chief is the AFMS
   Energy Manager and is responsible for energy issues specific to AFMS at the enterprise and
   MTF levels. The BCE Base Energy Manager is responsible for all energy issues on base.
   Any matters concerning energy consumption, reduction, or any projected or actual energy
   audits at the MTF must be coordinated with the Base Energy Manager and the AFMS Energy
   Manager. (T-3)
   5.17.2. The FM is responsible for development and maintenance of the energy conservation
   plan in coordination with MTF executive committee IAW the Tricare Management Activity
   (TMA) Energy and Water Efficient Operations and Maintenance Guidelines: Military Health
   System and AFPD 90-17, Energy Management. The plan will be updated annually and
   coordinated with the base energy manager. (T-0)
   5.17.3. Most conservation measures can be classified into six basic categories: awareness,
   maintenance, retrofit, replacement, new construction, and load shifting.
      5.17.3.1. Awareness measures are low-cost or no-cost measures that result from user
      education.
      5.17.3.2. Maintenance measures are low-cost ways to ensure peak performance from
      existing systems and continued high performance from new systems.
      5.17.3.3. Retrofit provides technological improvements to existing buildings and
      equipment.
      5.17.3.4. Replacement is the installation of high-efficiency equipment when existing
      equipment wears out. In addition, inefficient equipment should be replaced before its
      scheduled replacement time if economical.
      5.17.3.5. New construction offers an unparalleled opportunity to install the most cost-
      effective heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, lighting, and energy
      control equipment along with appropriate insulation, high-efficiency windows, and
      energy-saving design considerations.
      5.17.3.6. Load shifting of electrical loads away from peak demand periods saves money
      when the local utility imposes “demand charges” based not just on kilowatt-hours (kWh)
      of energy used, but also on the highest kilowatt (kW) demand, or rate of use, over a
      certain period.
AFI41-201 15 OCTOBER 2014                                                                    51


   5.17.4. Energy conservation project funding sources may include government, public
   utilities, or private sector through Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPC). The
   AFMS Energy Manager and Base Energy Manager may offer potential funding sources.
      5.17.4.1. Government. Funding through operations and maintenance (O&M) and
      MILCON from the Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP).
      5.17.4.2. Public Utilities.   Funding provided through Demand Side Management
      programs.
      5.17.4.3. ESPC. Private contractor evaluates, designs, finances, acquires, installs, and
      maintains energy saving equipment and/or systems for a client and receives
      compensation based on the energy consumption/cost savings performance of those
      equipment items/systems. Facility Managers must consult AFMSA/SG8F Facilities
      Operations and Engineering Branch for approval to enter into ESPC contracts. (T-3)
5.18. Linen Supply.
   5.18.1. Medical linen supply may be supported by laundry service provided by contract,
   inter-service support agreement (ISSA), memorandum of agreement (MOA), or a
   combination of these. Procedures for control and exchange of linen within the using
   activities and the use of contract services are in AFI 34-246, Chapter 6, Air Force Lodging
   Program.
   5.18.2. Linen storage and distribution services should be included in contracts or local base
   contracting managed housekeeping contracts IAW AFI 44-108. For MTFs using HAMS, the
   PWS for HAMS services, Section 5, provides guidance to include the hospital linen supply
   function as a part of the housekeeping activity. The HAMS PWS and execution assistance
   can be obtained from AFMSA/SG8F. (T-3)
   5.18.3. The MLFC will appoint an NCO or a GS-04/WG-04 or higher civilian as the Linen
   Supply Officer. (T-3)
   5.18.4. The Linen Supply Officer (LSO) will:
      5.18.4.1. Oversee MTF laundry and/or linen services, serve as the contract Functional
      Requirements Evaluator Designee (FRED), and ensure all PWSs, ISSAs, and MOAs
      clearly state the evaluation criteria (cleanliness, shrinkage, turnaround time, etc.) on
      which contractor performance will be based. (T-3)
      5.18.4.2. Maintain linen records. (T-2)
      5.18.4.3. Advise the MTF Infection Control Committee on issues relating to linen
      management. (T-3)
      5.18.4.4. Ensure linens are handled and transported IAW AFI 44-108, paragraph 3.11.3.
   5.18.5. Linen Supply Records. Use AF Form 581, Medical Linen Supply Record (or a
   similar computerized linen record keeping system developed at the MTF level), to record all
   items under the control of linen supply. (T-3)
