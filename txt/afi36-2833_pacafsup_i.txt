The Air Force Chief of Safety Outstanding Achievement Award for Ground Safety, Category II,
for fiscal year 2011 is presented to the 2d Special Operations Wing, Hurlburt Field, Florida.
During this period, the wing oversaw an amazing turn-around in off-duty fatalities, reducing the

education programs trained more than 2,500 base personnel in a myriad of supervisory,
motorcycle, and traffic safety subjects. Relevant world-wide, safety personnel supported safety
programs and investigations in five countries, including the only United States military ground
safety expert during humanitarian relief operations in the earthquake-damaged country of Haiti.
Absolute professionals, their multi-faceted awareness program resulted in wing personnel safely
navigating the 101 Critical Days of Summer and every major holiday.             The distinctive
accomplishments of the men and women of the 2d Special Operations Wing reflect great credit
upon themselves, Air Force Special Operations Command, and the United States Air Force.
