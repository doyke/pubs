This Air Force instruction (AFI) implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 99-1, Test and Evalua-
tion, by providing guidance and procedures for programming, requesting, allocating, and reporting the
expenditure of aerial targets and air-to-air missiles. It also establishes responsibility for programming and
allocating aerial targets and missiles for all Air Force organizations that conduct Air Force developmental
and operational testing, tactics development and evaluation (TD&E), weapon system evaluation programs
(WSEP), and competitions. This AFI must be used in conjunction with AFI 10-601, Operational Capa-
bility Requirements; AFI 63-101, Operations of Capabilities Based Acquisition System; AFI 99-103,
Capabilities Based Test And Evaluation; AFI 99-120, Forecasting and Programming Munitions Teleme-
try and Flight Termination Systems; AFI 21-201, Management and Maintenance of Non-Nuclear Muni-
tions; and AFI 36-2217, Munitions Requirements for Aircrew Training. It requires semi-annual reports
(Report Control Symbol (RCS) HAF-TEP (SA) 7101) to HQ USAF from each major command (MAJ-
COM) and the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC), which expend targets. This
instruction applies to the Air Force Reserve Command. Ensure that all records created as a result of pro-
cesses prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to
AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.af.mil/. Send comments and suggestions for
improvements on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, through channels, to HQ
USAF/TEP, 1530 AF Pentagon, Washington D.C. 20330-1530.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
AFI 99-108 is updated to incorporate guidance in AFI 99-103, Capabilities Based Test and Evaluation.
The new term “presentation authorization” (PA) is introduced. A new complementary instruction, AFI
99-120, Forecasting and Programming Munitions Telemetry and Flight Termination Systems, was created
to address funding and programming issues regarding the use of a Telemetry (TM) Instrumentation Kit
(TIK) and/or Flight Termination System (FTS) during developmental and operational test and evaluation
of munitions.

1. Planning for Aerial Target and Air-to-Air (A-A) Missile Expenditures. The Air Force has many
complex aircraft weapon systems requiring constant exercise to ensure their satisfactory performance in
operational units. The Air Force must thoroughly test new and modified systems to ensure they meet user
requirements. As these systems become more complex, and as tactical demands multiply, there is an
increase in quantity of the aerial targets MAJCOMs must expend to evaluate these systems in test and
evaluation (T&E) programs. To improve the means by which the Air Force ensures weapon combat capa-
bility, each MAJCOM and AFOTEC must establish a program to justify their operational requirements
and manage the targets it expends. For planning purposes, the Air Force considers every missile expendi-
ture a T&E event.

2. Applicable Aerial Targets and Missiles. This instruction only applies to missiles removed from war
reserve materiel (WRM) for any test program. MAJCOMs and AFOTEC will not include missiles pro-
cured directly from a contractor, specifically for the developmental test or operational test of that missile,
in the missile expenditure requests and reports. This instruction applies to the following types of aerial
targets and missiles:
   2.1. Subscale Aerial Target (SSAT): BQM-34; MQM-107; BQM-167 (Air Force Subscale Aerial
   Target: AFSAT).
   2.2. Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT): QF-4; Air Superiority Target (AST).
   2.3. Air Intercept Missile (AIM): AIM-7, AIM-9, AIM-120.

3. Programs Requiring Aerial Target and Missile Expenditures. The principal T&E programs in
which the Air Force expends its A-A missiles, aerial targets, and supporting resources on are developmen-
tal and operational testing and WSEP. NOTE: In this instruction, the term WSEP includes William Tell
and the USAF Weapons Instructor Course (WIC) missile firings.
   3.1. The Role of WSEP in Test and Evaluation. Air Combat Command (ACC) conducts WSEP to
   determine the overall operational effectiveness and suitability of fully integrated fielded weapon sys-
   tems in realistic operational scenarios while enhancing training. The goal of WSEP is to evaluate each
   weapon system within 12 months after fielding and continuing throughout its operational life cycle,
   using line of the Air Force crews, aircraft, and weapons. Although training is an important part of
   WSEP, it is a secondary objective. The primary objective is to gather effectiveness and suitability data
   on the complete weapons system. To achieve the primary objective, ACC/A3TW and the 53d Weap-
   ons Evaluation Group (53 WEG) will:
       3.1.1. Maintain an accurate missile firing database to support Air Force decision makers regard-
       ing operational capabilities, force structure recommendations, required material modifications,
       and requirements for new equipment.
       3.1.2. Ensure the accuracy of the database. As a goal, ACC should normally conduct enough mis-
       sile firings to define the probability of mission success (Pms) of each aircraft/missile combination.
       3.1.3. Provide accurate test data for determining the operational effectiveness and suitability of
       each weapon system.
       3.1.4. Identify weapon system deficiencies, determine causes, and make recommendations for
       improving operational effectiveness and suitability.

4. Responsibilities in the Aerial Target and Missile Allocation Process.
4                                                                               AFI99-108 1 MARCH 2007


    4.1. MAJCOM and AFOTEC Responsibilities for Planning Expenditure Requirements. E a c h
    MAJCOM and AFOTEC will prepare an eight-year plan to identify and justify the types of aerial tar-
    gets and missiles required for its T&E programs. In preparing this plan, consider system design
    requirements, test program objectives, present and future threats, aircraft resources, missile resources,
    target resources, range facilities, past WSEP results, and results from other test programs.
       4.1.1. Each MAJCOM and AFOTEC must establish the necessary coordination and review proce-
       dures to ensure projected expenditures are:
           4.1.1.1. Prioritized according to MAJCOM and AFOTEC requirements.
           4.1.1.2. Based on current operational tactics, scenarios, and concepts of operations.
           4.1.1.3. Realistic and conform to weapon system evaluation and other test program needs.
           4.1.1.4. Based on the need to determine weapon system effectiveness. The expenditures
           should be the absolute minimum required to meet test objectives or weapons system evalua-
           tion requirements.
           4.1.1.5. Based on data collected from previous firing programs and adjusted to fit the planned
           employment environment.
           4.1.1.6. Realistic considering the limited availability of assets.
           4.1.1.7. Based on warranty expiration considerations, if no overriding program guidance.
    4.2. MAJCOM and AFOTEC Directions for the Expenditure Request Format. The aerial tar-
    get and missile expenditure request must contain the items listed in Attachment 2. The MAJCOM or
    AFOTEC then forwards this request to HQ USAF/TEP for review and validation. The target/missile
    request must arrive at HQ USAF/TEP no later than 1 March of each year. For all Air Force Materiel
    Command (AFMC) conducted developmental test programs, the system program office (SPO) will
    include the requested targets/missiles in the appropriate Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP). For
    all HQ Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) conducted operational test pro-
    grams, HQ AFOTEC/XPR will request targets/missiles as described above and will ensure that
    required assets are listed in the Test Resource Plan (TRP). For all MAJCOM-conducted force devel-
    opment evaluations (FDE), the MAJCOM will request targets/missiles as described above and will list
    required targets in the TEMP, TRP, test plan, or COMACC Plan 85 for WSEP. NOTE: Inclusion of the
    request in the approved TEMP, TRP, test plan, or COMACC Plan 85 does not automatically provide
    target/missile support. Only direct aerial target allocation from HQ USAF/TEP and direct missile allo-
    cation from HAF/A5RW ensures support.
    4.3. HQ USAF Responsibilities.
       4.3.1. HQ USAF/TEP will :
           4.3.1.1. Aerial Target Allocations.
               4.3.1.1.1. Allocate aerial targets for all T&E programs including WSEP. Aerial target and
               associated munition items inventories do not allow 100 % support of all target requests.
               Therefore, HQ USAF/TEP will track historical target usage rates versus requests and will
               allocate targets based on these numbers and USAF priorities. HQ USAF/TEP will send
               final written target allocations to all MAJCOMs and AFOTEC before the beginning of
               each fiscal year (FY).
AFI99-108 1 MARCH 2007                                                                                    5


             4.3.1.1.2. Coordinate with ACC/A8X prior to publishing the annual aerial target alloca-
             tion letter.
             4.3.1.1.3. Issue a kill authorization (KA) when the expectation is that the unmanned target
             will be lost during the mission. A KA may be issued even if the potential of saving the tar-
             get through survivability maneuvers is likely. Even if no kill is anticipated, an aerial target
             that is on a “critical profile” as defined by AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports,
             requires a KA for launch.
             4.3.1.1.4. Issue a presentation authorization (PA) when there is not an expectation that the
             unmanned target will be lost during the mission. A PA will be issued if there are no live
             weapons fired at the target or weapons are planned to be terminated or kinematically
             defeated prior to impact.
             4.3.1.1.5. Require that programs obtain a KA or PA prior to launching an unmanned tar-
             get.
         4.3.1.2. Missile Allocations.
             4.3.1.2.1. Review and validate all test missile expenditure requests. The purpose of this
             validation is to ensure the missile request is a legitimate T&E requirement. HQ USAF/TEP
             then forwards the request to HQ USAF/A5RW. Procedures for forecasting and program-
             ming the air-to-air missiles telemetry and flight termination system are found in
             AFI 99-120.
     4.3.2. HQ USAF/A5RW will:
         4.3.2.1. Missile Allocations.
             4.3.2.1.1. Include the missile expenditure allocations in the annual USAF Tactical Air
             Missile Program (TAMP) document if the request is 100% supportable.
             4.3.2.1.2. Coordinate with HQ USAF/TEP, MAJCOM, and AFOTEC to determine priori-
             ties and resolve disconnects if the request is not 100% supportable.
  4.4. Defense Component, Command, and Agency Responsibilities. Any Department of Defense
  (DoD) component, command, or agency (i.e. Army, Navy, Northern Command) requiring Air Force
  aerial targets on a recurring basis will request the targets as described above. These organizations will
  provide procurement funds to the aerial targets system program office (691st Armament Systems
  Squadron (691 ARSS)) at least two years before the need date to allow the SPO sufficient time to
  increase the next planned production buy. For operations and maintenance costs, the using component
  will coordinate costs with the 53 WEG, ACC/A8X, and HQ USAF/TEP.
  4.5. MAJCOM and HQ USAF Responsibilities for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Programs.
  Each MAJCOM will request the targets they need for conducting FMS programs. When a foreign mil-
  itary program destroys an aerial target, whether intentional or not, the 53 WEG will advise the MAJ-
  COM responsible for the FMS program, which in turn, notifies the FMS case manager in SAF/IA or
  Air Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC). The SAF/IA FMS or AFSAC case manager then bills
  the foreign government for items expended. Once the foreign government has been billed and funds
  are on deposit, the MAJCOM aerial targets line manager (as identified in the FMS case) is responsible
  for getting these funds back to 691 ARSS. The line manager obtains a fund cite from 691 ARSS and
6                                                                            AFI99-108 1 MARCH 2007


    transfers money from the FMS account to 691 ARSS. The 691 ARSS uses the reimbursement funds to
    purchase replacement targets during the next production buy.

5. MAJCOM/AFOTEC Guidance for Using Allocated Aerial Targets.
    5.1. Aerial Target Allocation Deviations. Deviations from target allocations require HQ USAF/
    TEP coordination.
       5.1.1. Interchanging subscale aerial targets for full-scale aerial targets and vice-versa by any using
       agency (MAJCOM, AFOTEC, 53 WEG, DoD Agency) requires HQ USAF/TEP approval. Excep-
       tion: The 53 WEG may interchange subscale aerial target types or models between programs pro-
       vided they do not exceed total annual SSAT expenditure limits and are still able to meet user
       profile requirements.
    5.2. Aerial Target Survivability Measures. Test organizations, program managers, and the
    53 WEG will build target survivability maneuvers into every missile shot profile that does not have
    specific endgame requirements.
    5.3. Special Aerial Target Procedures. Target allocations not used in one fiscal year do not carry
    over to the next fiscal year. HQ USAF/TEP will provide a new set of allocations for each fiscal year
    in an annual Fiscal Year Target Allocations letter. An example of this letter is shown in Attachment
    3. Test programs that slip from one fiscal year to the next must submit a new request each year.
    5.4. Unprogrammed Aerial Target Requirements. MAJCOMs and AFOTEC will first try to fill
    unprogrammed target requirements (also known as out-of-cycle requests) from existing, current-year
    allocations. When the MAJCOM or AFOTEC cannot fill unprogrammed requirements, they must
    submit a request to HQ USAF/TEP. HQ USAF/TEP may authorize additional allocations provided the
    requirement is valid and inventories permit once the MAJCOM or AFOTEC has expended all other
    targets of the type requested.

6. MAJCOM/AFOTEC Guidance for Expending Allocated Missiles.
    6.1. Missile Allocation Deviations. Commands will not exceed programmed allocations from the
    TAMP without HQ USAF/TEP coordination and HQ USAF/A5RW approval.
    6.2. Special Missile Procedures. Missile allocations not used in one fiscal year do not carry over to
    the next fiscal year. The MAJCOM/AFOTEC will have to request new allocations. The one exception
    to this is when the missile has already been shipped to the test location and it has been configured
    (with telemetry, flight termination system, or other special equipment) for the test.
    6.3. Unprogrammed Missile Expenditure Requirements. MAJCOMs/AFOTEC should first try to
    fill unprogrammed missile requirements (also known as out-of-cycle requests) from existing cur-
    rent-year allocations. When unprogrammed requirements cannot be met, MAJCOM/AFOTEC must
    submit a request for additional allocations to HQ USAF/TEP who will validate the request and for-
    ward the recommendation to USAF/A5RW for approval. For guidance on funding and programming
    the missile telemetry and FTS kits, see AFI 99-120.

7. Semi-Annual Aerial Target / Missile Expenditure Report. All MAJCOMs and AFOTEC must sub-
mit a semi-annual report of all target and missile expenditures by 1 May and 1 November. Attachment 4
lists the items required in these reports.
AFI99-108 1 MARCH 2007                                                                                 7


8. Summary of Kill / Presentation Authorization Process. The current KA/PA process is shown in
Figure 1.. Each test program requests through their appropriate MAJCOM/AFOTEC the number of KA/
PA’s that are needed for the next eight years. The number of drones requested should be documented in
either an approved TEMP, TRP, or test plan. Programs should calculate the number of KA/PAs requested
as shown in Attachment 5. At the Aerial Targets KA/PA Conference and at the Tactical Air Missile Pro-
gram (TAMP) Conference in the spring of each year, the HQ and MAJCOMs/AFOTEC discuss the
requested number of aerial targets for each program as well as the expected expenditures. After consulta-
tion with the 53 WEG, the MAJCOMs/AFOTEC, and based upon current and projected inventory levels
(as well as the priority of test programs), HQ AF/TEP will issue the KAs/PAs by 30 September each year.
Programs then use the KA/PAs throughout the FY to test against aerial targets.

9. Summary of Aerial Target Acquisition Process. The aerial target acquisition process fits into the
KA/PA process in an indirect manner. ACC/A8X monitors the drone inventory and projected target
expenditures to finalize ACC’s budget request into the Air Force Program Objective Memorandum
(POM) submission. When Congress approves the President’s Budget, ACC/A8X authorizes the aerial tar-
get squadron (program office) of the air-to-air missile system wing to purchase aerial targets which then
enter the inventory after delivery from the aerial target contractor.

                         AERIAL TARGET / MISSILE REQUEST FORMAT

A2.1. Each MAJCOM and AFOTEC will submit an eight-year forecast of aerial target and missile expen-
ditures. MAJCOMs and AFOTEC will prioritize target requests according to their requirements and sub-
mit their forecasts annually no later than 1 March. No specific format is required; however, each request
must contain the following items:
     A2.1.1. DATE.
     A2.1.2. COMMAND/ORGANIZATION.
     A2.1.3. PROGRAM TITLE/PROGRAM ELEMENT (PE). Include the program title and pro-
     gram element code for each planned aerial target/missile expenditure (i.e. F-16 OFP/ PE 12345).
     A2.1.4. MISSILE TYPE/QUANTITY/TM/FTS. List the quantity, type, and series/subseries letter
     of the missiles requested (i.e. 2 x AIM-9M; 5 x AIM-120C5/6; 1 x AIM-120B). Also, if more than one
     type of missile could fill the requirement, specify by listing all usable series/subseries (i.e.
     AIM-120A/B/C3). List the type of missile TM/FTS package requested and see AFI 99-120 for fund-
     ing/programming for TM/FTS. Programs are responsible for obtaining their own TM/FTS. For mis-
     siles not requiring TM/FTS, specify why it is not required (i.e. “warhead shot” or “for separation
     purposes only”).
     A2.1.5. TARGET/AUTHORIZATION TYPE/ QUANTITY. List the quantity, type and model of
     target requested (i.e. any SSAT, MQM-107E, BQM-167A, QF-4, AST). Enter the total requirements
     by target/authorization type for each fiscal year (i.e. 2 KA x SSAT; 3 KA x QF-4; 1 PA x BQM-34).
     For KA/PA quantity determination, see Attachment 5.
NOTE: List both planned profiles per target and total required kills or expenditures. For a multiple-ship
profile, each target that is to be airborne requires a kill or presentation authorization.
     A2.1.6. SCORING SYSTEM. List the type of scoring system requested (i.e. scalar or vector).
     A2.1.7. TARGET AUGMENTATION. List the types of target augmentation systems requested (i.e.
     chaff, flares, electronic attack (EA) pod).
     A2.1.8. SPECIAL TARGET MODIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. Provide a general descrip-
     tion of any special engineering modifications that either the 53 WEG or the user will make to the tar-
     get (i.e. any special payloads, instrumentation systems, or other hardware modifications required for
     the target).
     A2.1.9. FISCAL YEAR. Group targets by fiscal year for a period covering the next eight consecu-
     tive fiscal years. Do not include the current fiscal year.
     A2.1.10. RANGE. Annotate if a range other than Eglin or Tyndall is required (i.e. White Sands Mis-
     sile Range).
     A2.1.11. REFERENCE and JUSTIFICATION: Include the reference (title and page number)
     from the TEMP, TRP, and/or test plan that justifies the aerial target request. Also include an electronic
     copy or an internet link for the TEMP, TRP, and/or test plan.

MEMORANDUM FOR SEE DISTRIBUTION


FROM: HQ USAF/TEP
        1530 Air Force Pentagon
        Washington DC 20330-1530


SUBJECT: FY06 Aerial Targets Allocation


1. USAF aerial targets support a variety of test and evaluation programs and are critical assets in ensuring
weapon system effectiveness and suitability. In order to preserve present and future aerial target capabili-
ties, we must adhere to a disciplined, efficient process for the allocation of these scarce resources. HQ
USAF/TEP, IAW AFI 99-108, allocates the aerial targets to AF and AF-sponsored customers.
2. The objective of the process is to provide an Air Force-wide forum for a detailed and comprehensive
review of planned test objectives. At the 2005 Tactical Air Missile Program (TAMP) Conference at Rob-
ins AFB, GA, each customer (AFMC, ACC, and AFOTEC) presented their FY06-FY13 aerial target and
missile requirements. The 53rd Weapons Evaluation Group (WEG) provided historical data and projected
usage rates for the full-scale aerial targets (FSAT) and the sub-scale aerial targets (SSAT). All of this data
was used by AF/TEP to develop the FY06 allocation computations and establish the kill authorizations
(KA) and presentation authorizations (PA) for FY06.
3. The PA is a term defining an authorization with the expectation that the target will not be damaged or
destroyed. Typical examples would include those presentations in which the target is not fired upon, mis-
sile is terminated before impact, or target is out of missile kinematic range at missile flyout. Until official
policy governing PAs is formalized, requests will be accepted and PAs issued on a case-by-case basis.
Any program that expends a target with a PA must notify AF/TEP immediately after the mission is com-
plete.
4. KA/PAs for FY06 expire at the end of the fiscal year. Air Force KA/PAs are for all targets owned and
operated by the Air Force on either the Eglin Gulf Range or the Whites Sands Missile Range (WSMR).
Each MAJCOM/AFOTEC is responsible for maintaining their test program(s) (including sponsored FMS
testing) within the yearly allocations. Swaps between programs, within the MAJCOM/AFOTEC, will be
coordinated with AF/TEP by appropriately addressed message or memorandum via e-mail or regular
mail. Any additional requirements, not covered by the annual allocation, will be addressed via an
out-of-cycle request IAW AFI 99-108.

8. AF programs requiring SSAT target support at another range, (i.e. Navy ranges such as Point Mugu or
China Lake) must first obtain an AF KA/PA and facilitate a MOA between the AF and the aerial target
supplier. AF customers using other services’ targets should not expect automatic “payback” of future AF
targets to that service. If target “payback” is necessary, requests must be coordinated with ample
lead-time, MAJCOM/AFOTEC support, and guidance from AF/TEP. Targets used for “payback” apply to
the basic airframe and engine only. EA, IR expendables and other such requirements must be handled
directly with the target operating agency or hardware supplier. Programs desiring to purchase targets and
equipment directly from a non-Air Force source, need not coordinate KA/PAs with AF/TEP; all responsi-
bilities are borne by the customer.
9. To efficiently manage the limited target assets, MAJCOMs/AFOTEC will inform AF/TEP and ACC/
A8X upon completion of the requirements for which the KA/PA was allocated. Unexpended KAs will be
AFI99-108 1 MARCH 2007                                                                                17


used to support other FY06 requirements and out-of-cycle requests as prioritized by AF/TEP. If, for exam-
ple, AMRAAM completes the original test shot matrix within the FY and do not expend all the allocated
KAs, the unused KAs are returned to the HQ test pool. The AMRAAM program does not retain the KAs
for “pop-up” test requirements later in the year.
10. Careful management of our limited aerial target inventory is required. Out-of-cycle KAs will be
closely scrutinized. To help preserve assets, drone-saving maneuvers should be planned and executed to
the maximum extent possible. Missiles should be flown to impact only when absolutely required to obtain
test data.
11. Questions should be directed to Lt Col Jane Smith, HQ AF/TEP, DSN 227-0208, Commercial (703)
697-0208. E-mail: Jane.Smith@pentagon.af.mil or SIPRNET e-mail af.tep@af.pentagon.smil.mil
