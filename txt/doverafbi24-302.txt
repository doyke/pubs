1. Policies.
   1.1. The 436th Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) Commander establishes local reporting
   procedures for vehicle and/or equipment abuse and accidents. Organizations utilizing GSA
   vehicles are responsible for any and all costs associated with government owned, leased, and
 2                                                   DOVERAFBI24-302 24 OCTOBER 2011


     rental vehicle abuse and/or accident damages.         See Attachments 2, 3, and 4 for
     accident/abuse process flow.
     1.2. The Vehicle Management Flight, 436 LRS/LGRV, implements and administers the
     436th Airlift Wing’s vehicle accident and abuse programs and policies.
        1.2.1. Vehicle abuse is normally considered damage caused by willful or negligent acts
        of improper operation or care. Note: Vehicle accidents resulting from a collision with a
        moving or fixed object will be handled based on the results of the police report.
        1.2.2. Incidents are classified as damage caused by acts of nature, natural disasters,
        mechanical failures or other phenomenon that in no way could have been avoided by safe
        operation or adequate vehicle care during non-use. Cases of incidents may also include
        damage resulting from normal use for the vehicle’s intended purpose (e.g., snow removal
        or heavy construction work). Using organizations are not required to reimburse for
        damage caused by incidents. Note: Wind damage to a vehicle door may not be
        considered an act of nature.
     1.3. The using organization is the responsible agency (e.g., U-Drive-It vehicles from Vehicle
     Operations or a loaned vehicle from another organization).
2. GSA Accident/Abuse Reporting and Procedures:
     2.1. The Responsible Organization’s Squadron (SQ) CC will:
        2.1.1. Appoint, in writing, unit Vehicle Control Officers (VCOs).
        2.1.2. Ensure Accident/Abuse/Incident procedures are followed by assigned personnel.
        Note: Once VCOs are appointed, they will receive required training by 436 LRS Vehicle
        Management and Analysis (LGRVA) so that they can accurately fulfill their VCO duties.
        2.1.3. Ensure approval procedures are in place to allocate unit funds for
        accident/abuse/incident repairs for assigned GSA vehicles and or equipment. Unit CCs
        are required to establish policy regarding the approval procedures of the unit’s finances.
        2.1.4. Ensure SQ Resource Advisors (RAs) and VCOs receive GSA Speed Pay training,
        conducted by 436 LRS/LGRVA for required training.
     2.2. When an accident/abuse/incident occurs, the vehicle operator will ensure the vehicle is
     not a safety hazard. Once the scene is safe, the accident/abuse/incident will be immediately
     reported to the following agencies/personnel so that they can report to the scene: Security
     Forces (SF), Wing Safety (AW/SE), and the using organization’s VCO.
     2.3. After being released from the SF investigation, the operator will document an accurate
     picture of the accident/abuse/incident on the SF Form 91, Motor Vehicle Accident Report,
     and witnesses will accomplish the SF Form 94, Statement of Witness.
     2.4. The Responsible Organization’s VCO will:
        2.4.1. Ensure the SF Form 91 is processed after the vehicle operator completes the form.
        2.4.2. Contact 436 LRS/LGRVA to determine if pictures are required for the case file.
        2.4.3. Obtain vendor quote(s) for vehicle/equipment that has been damaged. Three
        quotes are required if the initial quote received is above $2,500.00.
DOVERAFBI24-302 24 OCTOBER 2011                                                              3


     2.4.4. Fax the completed SF Form 91 and quote(s) to the GSA Accident Control Center.
     2.4.5. Take the GSA approved vendor quote to their organization’s RA.
  2.5. The Responsible Organization’s RA will:
     2.5.1. Verify funds are available and receive approval from the unit CC to allocate funds.
     Unit CCs are required to establish policy regarding the approval procedures of the unit’s
     finances.
     2.5.2. Ensure the vendor’s final bill is received from the VCO.
     2.5.3. Accomplish all financial transactions required to fulfill their obligation in GSA
     Speed Pay.
         2.5.3.1. If the unit operates on Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF)
         funding, the unit RA will contact the 436 LRS/Resource Advisor (LGLOR) to
         accomplish all financial transactions.
         2.5.3.2. For TWCF organizations, unit RAs and 436 LRS/LGLOR will ensure
         Finance certifies the Miscellaneous Obligation Reimbursement Document (MORD)
         for reimbursements.
  2.6. The 436 LRS/LGLOR will:
     2.6.1. Process the SF Form 1080, Voucher For Transfers Between Appropriations and/or
     Funds, to collect funds from certified MORD for each responsible TWCF organization.
     2.6.2. Track all reimbursements to ensure they are posted by the Defense Finance and
     Accounting Service (DFAS).

Terms
Responsible Organization— An organization is the responsible organization when vehicle
accident or abuse damage is caused by personnel assigned to the organization. The responsible
organization may not necessarily be the owning organization. For example, an organization
using vehicles owned by another organization is responsible for accident or abuse damage
caused by personnel assigned to the unit.
U—Drive-It Vehicle — A limited number of passenger and cargo vehicles available to support
organizations that do not have assigned vehicles and to augment units with assigned vehicles in
meeting infrequent peak requirements for short term (normally limited to 72 hrs) use.
Vehicle Abuse— An act or omission that results in damage caused by neglect or willful acts of
improper operation or care that cannot be attributable to fair wear and tear. When accident
repairs are required as a result of collision, in some instances, damage can be categorized as
vehicle abuse or incident. Usually, damage not attributable to fair wear and tear or accidents is
characterized abuse.
Vehicle Accident— Any incident where a GOV/E strikes or is struck by another GOV/E, non-
GOV/E, and/or object, structure or animal where action by any vehicle operator involved could
have prevented the outcome.
Vehicle Incident— Any situation where a GOV/E sustains damage where the actions of any
vehicle operator involved could not have prevented the outcome (i.e., act of nature).
