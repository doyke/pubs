16. Home Station Recovery Process.
   16.1. Upon return from exercise, all weapons will be cleared at a clearing barrel prior to
   turn-in to armory or storage vault.
   16.2. Using the buddy system all ammunition pouches, rucksacks, mobility bags and
   magazines will be checked for blank ammunitions, spent ammunition, or live ammunition. If
   any ammunition is found, it will be turned in to the Munitions Custodian immediately.
17. Transportation of explosives.

908TH AIRLIFT WING EXERCISE BLANK AMMUNITION PRE-EXERCISE SAFETY
                       BRIEFING/CHECKLIST

    Explosives will be handled, transported, and used only by personnel trained in the task to be
performed.
    Explosives will not be tumbled, thrown, dropped, or handled in a rough manner.
   No attempt will be made to disassemble, modify, or alter explosive items; or to use in a
manner other than their intended purpose.
    If abnormal conditions relating to the safe configuration of an explosive item are noted, no
attempts will be made to use or correct the condition. Notify the Weapons Safety Manager, the
Munitions Supervisor, and Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) for assistance as needed.
    Explosive items will be stored and transported in their approved storage and shipping
container.
    Only the quantity of munitions necessary for a specific operation will be drawn from storage.
    A pre-exercise safety briefing will be conducted for all personnel before deployment to the
exercise site.
    Individuals armed with live ammunition IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air
Force Personnel, will not participate in the exercise scenario. Weapons will be loaded IAW AFI
31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Procedures, at an approved clearing barrel.
    In the event of an emergency, the exercise scenario will be stopped, all weapons will be
placed in the safe position, and personnel will await instructions from appropriate supervisory
personnel.
    Leather gloves will be used when handling or moving munitions containers.
    Blank ammunition will not be fired from any weapon that does not have a blank adapter
installed.
    Blank ammunitions (M-16) will not be fired at personnel any closer than 30 feet.
    Loading and unloading of weapons will be performed at approved clearing barrel areas.
    Weapons will NEVER be fired from inside buildings.
   Blank firing adapters will NEVER be covered or camouflaged in any way and will only be
hand tightened.
    Blank M-16A2 ammunition will not be fired at or toward personnel who are within 30 feet.
Personnel within the firing limits can be acted upon by calling out “Safety Kill”. Cadre will
determine if the person being fired at will be considered a casualty. If it cannot be determined
the aggressor or defender will be instructed to fall back to a safe distance and re-engage the
target.
     All assigned personnel are responsible for complying with explosive safety standards,
instructions, and Technical Orders; identifying hazards, using protective equipment, and
reporting injury or impaired health conditions to their supervisors.
 14                                                                  908AWI91-201 5 MAY 2008


    During all exercises where blank ammunition is used; it is the responsibility of everyone to
ensure that no live ammunition is introduced in the exercise. Each member must check their
ammunition at the beginning and ending of each shift on each day of the exercise. All
discrepancies will be reported at once to member’s supervisor.
   Individuals armed with live ammunition IAW AFI 31-207, Arming and Use of Force by Air
Force Personnel, will not participate in the exercise scenario.
     Blank ammunition and live ammunition will not be stored in the same immediate area. All
live ammunitions will be identified as such by the placement of signs and/or markers.
    All magazines loaded with blank ammunition shall be marked with the color blue. Use blue
paint or blue tape; a minimum of 3 inches wide on the bottom two thirds of the magazine to mark
magazine loaded with blank munitions.
    All members issued blank ammunitions must visually inspect their loaded magazine to
ensure no live ammunition is present.
   All weapons must be cleared, inspected, and function checked prior to issuance of blank
ammunition to ensure no foreign material, live rounds, or projectiles are in the weapon.
    M16’s will not be used as guard weapons. Members armed with the M-16 and performing
official duties will not be permitted into the exercise area. Individuals qualified to carry the M-9
pistol will perform ―Over-watch‖ (Guard Duty) for protection of resources used in field
exercises. The base of the M-9 magazine will be painted red to identify the magazine and the M-
9 as containing ―Live Rounds‖.
      Blank ammunition has a distinctive star crimp at the tip and does not have a projectile.
      All M-16 weapons will be fitted with blank adapters prior to loading blank ammunition.
    Prior to loading a magazine or weapon, visually inspect ammunition to ensure that blank
ammunition is being used. Load each round individually for 100% accuracy. All magazines
loaded with blank ammunition shall be marked with the color blue. Use blue paint or blue tape;
a minimum of 3 inches wide on the bottom two thirds of the magazine to mark magazine loaded
with blank munitions.
    Visually inspect each magazine to ensure that no ammunition has been accidentally left in
the magazine during prior usage.
    In the event that a preloaded magazine is given to you, carefully examine each individual
round to ensure that no projectile is visible.
    Prior to start of all training exercises, check all ammunition pouches, rucksacks, mobility
bags, and magazines for live ammunitions.
     The safety official will conduct a safety briefing prior to exercise beginning; a sign in sheet
will be completed and maintained for a period of 90 days in the squadron safety office.
     In the event of an emergency, the exercise scenario will be stopped, all weapons will be set
to safe, and personnel will await instructions from appropriate supervisory personnel.
    If an armed person becomes sick or injured, their weapon and ammunition will be turned
over to the person in charge for proper turn-in.
