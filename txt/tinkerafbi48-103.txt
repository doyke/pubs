SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises TINKERAFBI 48-103 by (1) changing the telephone for the
Optometry Clinic (72 AMDS/SGPE) from 734-2582 to 582-6516.
1. Policies:
   1.1. Respirators will be used only in accordance with AFOSH Std 48-137, paragraph 4.2.1.
 2                                                           TINKERAFBI48-103 3 JULY 2008


     1.2. The type of respirator to be used will be specified by the 72 AMDS/SGPB,
     Bioenvironmental Engineering Flight (BEF), using selection criteria referenced in NIOSH,
     OSHA, and AFOSH guidance. Only respirators provided by Tinker AFB and specified by
     BEF will be used. Privately procured respirators will not be allowed.
     1.3. The use of filtering face pieces, more commonly referred to as “dust masks”, is at the
     employee’s discretion and supervisors will not direct or require the use of these devices.
     Filtering face pieces will not be used as a substitute for required respiratory protection.
     1.4. The non-routine use of respirators will be utilized in only those situations that have been
     previously identified and evaluated by BEF. Any guidelines or limitations set forth by BEF
     will be strictly adhered to.
     1.5. At no time will compressed shop air be used as a breathing air source. All breathing air
     sources must be approved and inspected by BEF prior to initial use. All breathing air
     couplings must be incompatible with outlets for non-respirable worksite air or other gas
     systems.
     1.6. All confined space entries must be evaluated prior to entry IAW AFOSH Std 91-25,
     Confined Spaces, to determine the need for respiratory protection.
     1.7. The only Tinker AFB organizations authorized to maintain respiratory protection
     equipment for emergency or rescue use are the Fire Department, BEF and those
     organizations who are performing support operations under the direction of the Fire
     Department. The inspection of this equipment will be conducted and documented IAW
     AFOSH Std 48-137.
2. Responsibilities:
     2.1. Workplace supervisors will:
        2.1.1. Contact BEF at 734-7844 as needed for information and guidance regarding
        respiratory protection matters. In case of an emergency after duty hours, a BEF
        representative may by reached through the Command Post at 739-2171.
        2.1.2. Contact BEF upon initial assignment to a workplace that requires the use of
        respiratory protection to obtain training as required by AFOSH Std 48-137. This training
        must be annotated on the supervisor’s AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health
        Record, or electronic equivalent. Subsequent supervisor training will be conducted
        annually during the BEF annual evaluation of the workplace respiratory protection
        program.
        2.1.3. With assistance from BEF, develop, maintain, and enforce a workplace-specific
        written respiratory protection plan (WWRPP) IAW in AFOSH Std 48-137. This
        WWRPP must be reviewed and approved by BEF annually.
        2.1.4. Ensure that all personnel in the work area, to include assigned, new, on-loan, and
        personnel on TDY status to Tinker AFB, who perform tasks requiring the use of
        respiratory protection use only respiratory protection as approved by the Tinker BEF.
        The supervisor will ensure that the personnel understand how to use the respiratory
        protection equipment and any associated equipment such as breathing air sources prior to
        the assignment of the tasks.
