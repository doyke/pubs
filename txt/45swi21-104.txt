This instruction implements AFSPCI 21-104, Systems Requirements and Implementation Approval Pro-
cess. It establishes a uniform process to identify, approve/validate, control, prioritize, and provide status
of Eastern Range Instrumentation Systems (ERIS) requirements derived from problems or limitations
with ERIS, and enhancement to ERIS due to changes in Range or Customer needs. It applies to personnel
and agencies of the 45th Space Wing (45 SW) involved in the acquisition, installation, integration, test,
evaluation, logistics support, operation, and maintenance of new or modified instrumentation systems on
the Eastern Range (ER).

5. Requirements Process.
   5.1. The 45 SW Requirements Process (Figure 1.), as defined in the following paragraphs, is the pro-
   cess for documenting and approving requirements for new or modified ERIS. Process and timelines
   are implemented using an electronic tool, accessed via the following link: https://
   imis.rc.patrick.af.mil/vrvhome/. ER RSs approved by 45 RMS and/or HQ AFSPC are defined as
   ‘Validated’.
   5.2. Any individual (i.e., Customer) involved with the Range can draft and submit a proposed RS for
   a requirement derived from a problem, limitation, or needed enhancement to ERIS. This is accom-
   plished by accessing the electronic tool and clicking on the “add new” button under “RS-1320
   Requirement Statement” heading. After submittal, the RS is electronically forwarded to obtain 45 SW
   review, coordination, and approval.
   5.3. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Scope and Funding Assessment.
      5.3.1. RSs that are not within the scope of the O&M Statement of Work will be forwarded for 45
      SW Assessment by support contractors and the assigned 45 RMS engineer, see paragraph 5.4.
4                                                                  45SWI21-104 28 SEPTEMBER 2007


       5.3.2. RSs that are within the scope of the O&M Statement of Work and do not require additional
       contract funds are implemented by the O&M contractor.
       5.3.3. RSs within the scope of the O&M Statement of Work, but not currently funded, must be
       funded by the 45 SW or Range Customer; otherwise the RS is returned to the Customer. Upon
       receipt of funding, 45 RMS initiates a Contract Change Request authorizing the O&M contractor
       to perform the work.
       5.3.4. At completion, O&M contractor requests customer buyoff.
       5.3.5. 45 SW RVB Chair reviews closure recommendations and either grants closure or returns to
       O&M contractor.
    5.4. The 45 SW Assessment.
       5.4.1. A technical assessment is conducted on the proposed RS. The technical assessment ensures
       RS content is complete and correct. It is accomplished by one or more of the following: Range
       Technical Services Contract (RTSC) Contractor; Performance Evaluation, Test & Simulation
       (PET&S) Contractor; SpaceLift Range Systems Contract (SLRSC) Contractor.
       5.4.2. The 45 RMS reviews and resolves all technical comments received against the RS. Any
       changes to the RS during this process are coordinated with the Customer.
       5.4.3. The assigned 45 RMS Engineer reviews the RS and provides an approval and priority rec-
       ommendation to the 45 SW RVB.
    5.5. The 45 SW Validation.
       5.5.1. The 45 SW RVB members, identified in section 4, review the RS content, technical assess-
       ments, and priority and provide approval/disapproval and priority recommendations to the 45 SW
       RVB Chair via the electronic tool and timelines.
       5.5.2. The 45 SW RVB Chair (45 RMS/CC) reviews the RVB recommendations and may update
       the RS’s content and priority. The Chair then either cancels or approves the RS. If approved, the
       RS is forwarded as follows:
           5.5.2.1. Local validation requires all the following criteria to be met: 1) no impact to form, fit,
           or function; 2) Government estimate less than $500K; and 3) no Performance Specification
           level impact. If this criteria is met, there is no requirement for HQ validation and the RS is for-
           warded to SMC.
           5.5.2.2. An RS not meeting local validation criteria is forwarded to HQ AFSPC. HQ either
           validates the RS and provides a priority or returns the RS to 45 RMS for update or cancella-
           tion.
    5.6. An RS validated locally or by HQ is submitted to SMC and included in the next HQ AFSPC
    approved IPL update.
    5.7. SMC develops the solution, creates an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP), obtains Configura-
    tion Control Board (CCB) approval of the ECP, and implements the solution approved in the ECP.
    5.8. SMC resolves the RS then recommends closure via the Readiness Review Board (RRB) and
    sends the RS to the 45 SW for customer buyoff. The 45 SW performs any additional tests for opera-
    tional acceptance.

   5.9. The 45 SW RVB Chair approves closure or returns RS to SMC.

Terms
Eastern Range (ER)—The designated area of responsibility for the AFSPC managed Launch and Test
Range System (LTRS) activity for tracking and command/control of missiles, launch vehicles, and
specific spacecraft from the Eastern United States.
Eastern Range Instrumentation Systems (ERIS)—Range instrumentation systems are the combination
of software, firmware, and hardware required to perform the ER mission. This includes, but is not limited
to, radar, telemetry, optics, Global Positioning System (GPS), weather, data processing,
telecommunications, command and control, display, closed circuit television, monitoring and
surveillance, and simulation in implementation with automated information systems to acquire, display,
an analyze data collected as an instrumentation network in support of ballistic missiles, space shuttle and
other launch systems, aircraft fly-bys, and orbital satellites.
Integrated Priority List (IPL)—A record containing all validated RSs. The list is published every six
months by HQ AFSPC and is given to SMC to assist in determining execution order. The IPL is reviewed
semi-annually by all parties. All the contents of the IPL are reviewed according to subsystem such as
weather, radar, or telemetry.
Requirements Statement (RS)—Communicates the requirement to request ERIS modification. After
validation by 45 SW and/or HQ AFSPC, the requirement is tasked to the System Program Office (SPO)
or the authorized implementer(s) to modify the ERIS.
Validated—Signifies that a requirement has been approved by the 45 SW. At this point the requirement
is tasked to SMC or O&M for implementation.
