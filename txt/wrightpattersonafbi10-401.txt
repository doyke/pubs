                                      RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Responsibilities.
     1.1.1. The 88 ABW Planning Process: This section provides an overview of the WPAFB
     planning process and the interrelationships of the necessary agencies involved. This process
     is designed to facilitate the development, maintenance, and updating of all WPAFB
     installation-level plans the 88 ABW is tasked to support. This instruction only applies to 88
     ABW/installation-level plans (plans in which multiple installation agencies are tasked for
     input and are signed by the Installation Commander (88 ABW/CC)). Individual units may
     use this document as a guide.
1.2. Responsibilities: This section spells out the specific responsibilities of each agency in the
planning process.
     1.2.1. Chief, Plans and Programs Division (88 ABW/XP).
        1.2.1.1. Administer the 88 ABW planning program.
        1.2.1.2. Appoint a WPAFB Plans Manager to facilitate the 88 ABW planning program.
        1.2.1.3. Be responsible for approving all plan changes and reviews.
        1.2.1.4. Sign the Memorandum of Transmittal on all 88 ABW plans as designated by the
        88 ABW/CC.
     1.2.2. WPAFB Plans Manager.
        1.2.2.1. Manage the WPAFB plans process.
        1.2.2.2. Develop a plans instruction (this document), outlining specific information
        essential to the continuity of plans responsibilities.
        1.2.2.3. Prepare a listing (WPAFB Plans Catalog) of all WPAFB Plans as of 31 March,
        30 June, 30 September and 31 December each year and forward it to all affected WPAFB
        organizations. This listing will also identify office of responsibility (OPR) for each plan.
        1.2.2.4. Coordinate and delegate necessary tasks for preparation of functional area inputs
        with OPRs for each plan.
        1.2.2.5. Review and approve all installation-level plans before final submission,
        publication, and distribution. After receiving legal coordination from ASC/JA, 88
        ABW/XP signs the transmittal letter and sends to the 88 ABW/CC for signature of the
        plan.
        1.2.2.6. Ensure approved plans are posted to 88 ABW/XPX Plans Library SharePoint
        site: https://org.eis.afmc.af.mil/sites/88abw/XP/XPX/Plans/default.aspx and proper
        distribution to tasked organizations and HQ Air Force Materiel Command (HQ AFMC).
        1.2.2.7. Establish an effective base plans annual review program. Forward review
        schedules for the following 88 ABW calendar year each October to all units that are
        OPRs for plans.
WPAFBI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    5


       1.2.2.8. Monitor and document all plan preparation, review, revision, and change actions
       through appropriate suspense deadliness and follow-up actions.
   1.2.3. 88 ABW Unit Commanders/Directors. Commanders, both at the group and unit level,
   are integral to the plans process. Commanders must ensure the following:
       1.2.3.1. That coordination procedures are followed within their unit and that all
       necessary unit agencies have coordinated accordingly.
       1.2.3.2. That plans suspense deadlines are met.
       1.2.3.3. Units which are an OPR for a base plan will designate in writing the office
       responsible for the plan. See Figure 1.1 for Plan OPR Appointment Letter format.
   1.2.4. Unit Plan OPRs. The Unit Plan OPR is responsible for the development and
   maintenance of their organization’s plan. Each organization responsible for a plan will
   appoint a primary and alternate point of contact (POC). Some examples of OPRs are 88th
   Security Forces Squadron (88 SFS) for the Integrated Defense Plan, and 88th Civil Engineer
   Directorate (88 ABW/CE) for the WPAFB Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan
   (CEMP) 10-2. Plan OPRs will:
       1.2.4.1. Notify 88 ABW/XPX of the intent to produce or change a 88 ABW plan or
       annex in accordance with the annual review schedule or other applicable guidance (HHQ
       directive, etc.).
       1.2.4.2. Comply with the procedures and formats in this instruction and all applicable
       referenced publications when preparing a new plan, or revising or issuing a change to an
       existing plan.
       1.2.4.3. In conjunction with 88 ABW/XPX, conduct an annual review of all plans for
       which the organization is OPR in accordance with the schedule published by 88
       ABW/XPX or when governing directives or an organizational change dictate a review.
       1.2.4.4. Prior to initiating annual review process and following consolidation of
       Group/Unit coordination comments, provide 88 ABW/XPX an electronic copy of the
       draft plan in Microsoft Word.
           1.2.4.4.1. Submit Group/Unit coordination emails to 88 ABW/XPX for records
           management purposes. Ensure decision regarding each Group/Unit coordination
           comment is annotated in the “Decision” column of Figure 2.3.
           1.2.4.4.2. In order to deconflict all Group/Unit coordination, OPRs will provide
           Office of Coordination Responsibility (OCRs) justification in regards to final
           determinations made when an OCR’s comment/recommendation is rejected or
           modified.
1.3. Plans Maintenance. Each WPAFB unit will ensure they maintain access to the WPAFB
Plans Library located on the 88 ABW/XP SharePoint site.
1.4. Operations Security (OPSEC). Protection of Critical Information (CI) within WPAFB
plans, checklists, and plans correspondence is vital to security and mission accomplishment of
operations. OPSEC applies to all activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all
phases of operations. CI concerning personnel, logistics, training, and operational matters
which, when properly correlated to reveal operational capability, must be identified in the plan to
 6                                                     WPAFBI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2010


ensure those implementing the plan know what needs to be protected for the plan’s successful
execution. Plans OPRs must remain aware at all times of the need to safeguard CI. While Plans
OPRs must incorporate a strong sense of OPSEC responsibility into all plans, checklists, and
operating instructions (OIs), all WPAFB personnel affected by the plan are responsible for
ensuring OPSEC.
1.5. Classification Management: WPAFB plans or their annexes that are classified must be
managed and protected. It is the responsibility of the information holder to properly mark,
safeguard, transmit, destroy, allow access, classify and declassify within Presidential Executive
Order 13526, ISOO Directive #1, Classified National Security Information, and DoD 5200.1-R,
Information Security Program.
1.6. Controlled Unclassified Information Storage. Plans containing Controlled Unclassified
Information (CUI) should be marked and protected as require protection against public
disclosure. See DoDR 5400.7-R_AFMAN33-302, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program,
and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management for safeguard requirements.
WPAFBI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2010                                                          7

                                            Chapter 2

                            PREPARING AND UPDATING PLANS

2. 1. Preparing and Updating Plans:
     2.1.1. Plan Development. Anyone with knowledge of a requirement to produce a plan
     should notify 88 ABW/XPX to ensure proper coordination and tracking. Any 88
     ABW/installation plan which tasks multiple organizations should be incorporated into the
     WPAFB Plans Process.
2.2. OPR Determination. The OPR for WPAFB plans is determined by the source document
requiring the plan or 88 ABW/CC tasking its creation. Normally, the 88 ABW OPR is
functionally aligned with the HQ AFMC OPR.
2.3. Identifying Plans. WPAFB plans are assigned a title to coincide with the title of the higher
headquarters plans they support or as specified by higher headquarters directive (if applicable).
If there is no higher headquarters directive, or it is a base-level plan, see 88 ABW/XPX for
identification guidance prior to proceeding with coordination. Unless specifically required, Air
Force Instruction numbers will not be used in conjunction with WPAFB plan names.
     2.3.1. Many plans are incorrectly labeled as “OPLAN” because they contain some type of
     operational activity. An Operations Plan (OPLAN) is a unified or major command plan for
     fighting a war or contingency operation. It will contain data and will direct units in
     contingency operations, provide deployment data, etc. The creation of an OPLAN must be
     approved by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.
     2.3.2. An installation-level plan that is not supporting a higher headquarters plan is labeled
     as such, e.g., WPAFB Installation Deployment Plan. For further guidance, consult AFMAN
     10-401V2, Planning Formats and Guidance, or Joint Operation Planning and Execution
     System Volume 2 (JOPESV2). There is no “base OPLAN.” If a plan OPR determines there
     is a conflict between this instruction and any higher headquarters guidance, notify 88
     ABW/XPX immediately.
2.4. Plan Format. 88 ABW plans are written in the format described in this instruction unless
otherwise prescribed in a higher headquarters directive. This instruction is based on AFMAN
10-401V2, and follows that format. Sample plan formats and administrative details are provided
in Chapter 3. Deviations should be kept to a minimum to maintain standardization. Refer to
ISOO Directive #1, Classified National Security and DoD/CAPCO Marking Guide for guidance
on preparation and marking of classified plans.
2.5. Plan Suspenses. Plan OPRs, tasked organizations with Office of Coordination
Responsibility (OCR), and ASC/JA, must make every effort to meet suspense deadlines for
annual reviews, changes and revisions. 88 ABW/XPX will contact Plan OPRs and ASC/JA if
they fail to meet suspense in order to determine status. During initial group/unit coordination, it
is mandatory that all organizations provide feedback. A formal higher headquarters (HHQ) plans
tasking requires sufficient lead time to ensure suspense deadlines are met. Local suspense will
be determined by the amount of lead time provided by HHQ. All suspense requirements can
only be achieved with the full cooperation of all Team Wright-Patterson Commanders, 88 ABW
Plans staff and Plans OPRs.
WPAFBI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2010                                                                    9


2.6. Plan Preparation Process. Any unit wishing to or tasked to develop a plan should first
consult 88 ABW/XPX to determine if a similar document already exists. The unit will then
gather the necessary information and build the plan according to the guidance in this document
and any applicable higher headquarters documentation. Refer to Paragraph 2.9 for coordination
procedures.
2.7. Plan Review Process. A plan is reviewed, unless indicated elsewhere, on the anniversary
of its publication. 88 ABW/XPX will facilitate the review process for all plans identified in the
WPAFB Plans Catalog. Remember to consider the impact of Host-Tenant Support Agreements
(OPR: 88 MSG/LGRRP) when making adjustments to WPAFB plans. The review is intended to
identify areas requiring updates, changes, modifications, etc. If less than 40 percent of the plan
is changed, a change memorandum signed by the Chief, 88 ABW/XP will be published. In this
situation, the plan’s publication date does not change.
   2.7.1. Identifying Changes.
       2.7.1.1. All changes will include a Memorandum of Transmittal letter (Change Page).
       Paragraph 1 of the Memorandum of Transmittal will contain the date of the change, the
       date of the basic plan and the classification (if classified) of the basic plan. (See Figure
       2.1).
       2.7.1.2. A copy of the distribution list must be attached to the Memorandum of
       Transmittal. If a new Annex Z is accomplished, a distribution list is not required. The
       “To” element should read: “See Attached Distribution List” or “See Annex Z.”
       2.7.1.3. Page Changes. Re-accomplish all pages on which changes occur and place the
       change number and date of the change in parentheses below the page number; for
       example: (“Change 1, 30 Jun 2010”). To indicate new or changed material, use a
       vertical line in the left margin of the page next to changed material (example left of this
       paragraph).
   2.7.2. Out-of-Cycle Review. Chief, 88 ABW/XP or WPAFB plans OPRs can direct an out-
   of-cycle review of any plan for which they are the OPR. An out-of-cycle review is when the
   review process is initiated at any time other than a plan’s annual review date. Out-of-cycle
   reviews should only be initiated when major changes are required as a result of new or
   revised higher headquarter guidance. Major changes include the addition or deletion of
   functional requirements which affect an organization’s ability to conduct their mission
   essential tasks.
2.8. Plan Revision Process. A plan revision will be issued if total adjustments (any new or
previously changed material) affect 40 or more percent of the plan, or if the plan has completed
three consecutive review cycles without a change. The revision process is detailed in the
checklist located in Attachment 3. Plan format examples are provided in Chapter 3. Comply
with all checklist steps and information in this instruction when preparing a plan revision. When
a plan revision is accomplished, the publication date of the plan will change (and subsequently
its annual review date) to the date the revision was signed by Chief, 88 ABW/XP. Follow the
coordination steps as outlined in Paragraph 2.9 to accomplish a plan revision.
   2.8.1. Issuing Changes Following Plan Review. Follow the coordination procedures
   outlined in Paragraph 2.9 for issuing changes. Changes will be prepared by following the
 10                                                    WPAFBI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2010


   procedures below and the checklist in Attachment 4. Changes will be coordinated with all
   agencies affected by the change and approved by Chief, 88 ABW/XP prior to publication.
2.9. Coordination Process.
   2.9.1. 88 ABW/XPX will provide direction and oversight of the coordination process. The
   88 ABW/XP WPAFB Plans Manager will obtain initial group/unit coordination via
   Electronic Staff Summary Sheet (E-SSS) (Figure 2.2). Each group/unit commander and
   staff agency tasked in the plan will receive an E-SSS for shotgun coordination. Inputs will
   be consolidated by each organization and forwarded to the Plan OPR. The OPR will
   consolidate all comments from group/unit coordination and if there are several changes, the
   plan will be sent out again for two letter group/unit coordination. Refer to Figure 2.3 for
   comment matrix example. The consolidated draft plan will be provided to the WPAFB Plans
   Manager.
   2.9.2. Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). ASC/JA will provide legal coordination on all WPAFB
   plans. See Figure 2.5 for example of ASC/JA E-SSS coordination.
   2.9.3. 88 ABW/CC Approval. 88 ABW/CC will approve only newly generated plans or
   those that have gone through the revision process. Chief, 88 ABW/XP, will approve annual
   plan reviews (See Paragraph 2.7). WPAFB Plans Manager will generate an ESSS to obtain
   88 ABW/CC approval of the plan (Figure 6.1). Chief, 88 ABW/XP, will sign the
   Memorandum of Transmittal and the 88 ABW/CC will sign the basic plan. All WPAFB
   plans must be reviewed by 88 ABW/XP prior to final coordination to the 88 ABW/CC.
2.10. Plan Reproduction and Distribution.
   2.10.1. Hardcopy Reproduction. As required, individual organizations will be responsible
   for hard copy reproduction of plans. All hard copy plans will be printed head-to-head,
   stapled at the top left, 3-hole punched, and have a finished size of 8½ x 11. Plans must be
   collated and blank sheets will be inserted as required to ensure each section starts on an odd
   numbered page. Front and back covers will be on heavy colored card stock and must be
   marked “UNCLASSIFIED,” “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY,” “CONFIDENTIAL,” or
   “SECRET,” as applicable (see Paragraph 3.3 for specific marking guidance). To save paper,
   plans may be reproduced electronically.
   2.10.2. Distribution.
      2.10.2.1. Distribution Statements. OPRs responsible for plans classified as
      “CONFIDENTIAL,” or “SECRET,” will determinate need to mark Plan Covers with
      Distribution Statements IAW DoDD 5230.24, Distribution Statements on Technical
      Documents.
      2.10.2.2. WPAFB Plans Manager will distribute plans via email (NIPRNET or SIPRNET
      depending on classification of the plan) in accordance with Annex Z.
      2.10.2.3. Unclassified and “For Official Use Only” plans will be posted to the 88
      ABW/XP Plans Library SharePoint site unless otherwise exempted by the Chief, 88
      ABW/XP. If a plan contains specific OPSEC CI Listing, consideration will be given to
      exempt the plan from posting to limit access to the CI list.

                                      PLANS FORMAT

3.1. Plans Format:
   3.1.1. Plan Elements: Plans are comprised of a number of elements including a cover page,
   letter of transmittal, table of contents, security instructions (with record of changes and
   record of review), plan summary, basic plan, annexes, appendices and tabs. All WPAFB
   plans will include these elements in the order listed, unless specified otherwise in higher
   headquarters directives:
   3.1.1.1. Plan Cover. The front cover must show the issuing installation, full title of plan,
   date of the plan, and a picture of the Team Wright-Patt shields. All cover page text should be
   Times New Roman, 24 font, and bold. See Paragraph 3.3 for instructions on properly
   marking the plan’s classification and Figure 3.1 for proper format. As required, CUI guides
   with distribution statements will be centered on the bottom of the page.
   3.1.2. Memorandum of Transmittal. The Memorandum of Transmittal of a plan should
   identify the reason for preparing the plan. The need for preparing further supporting plans
   must be specified. The OPR for the plan must be identified and disposition instructions must
   be included when the plan supersedes a previous plan. The Memorandum of Transmittal is
   not numbered and is signed by the Chief, 88 ABW/XP. The date of the transmittal letter
   should be the same as that of the plan. The transmittal letter should include the Department
   of the Air Force heading and a picture of the Department of Defense seal. Within the body
   of the transmittal letter, include a link to the 88 ABW/XPX SharePoint site where the specific
   plan is kept. Figure 3.2 contains an example of a correctly formatted Memorandum of
   Transmittal.
   3.1.3. Table of Contents. The Table of Contents will include the first page of each section.
   It will also include elements published separately. Identify each Annex, Appendix and any
   other attachments included within the document. The Table of Contents page is also the first
   numbered page in the document (page will be numbered “i”). Figure 3.3 shows the correct
   table of contents format.
   3.1.4. Security Instructions and Record of Changes/Reviews. The security instructions must
   include the long and short titles of the plan, the classification requirements, and should state
   any reproduction limitations. The Record of Changes/Record of Annual Review should
   include two tables for posting changes within the document. Figure 3.4 contains security
   instructions and record of changes format.
   3.1.5. Plan Summary. The plan summary is used for all plans. It provides a brief review of
   the mission, general situation, concept of operations, and commander’s appraisal of the
   logistics and personnel feasibility of the plan. Refer to Figure 3.6 for plan summary format.
   The paragraphs indicated in Figure 3.6 are mandatory; subparagraphs are at the discretion of
   the plan OPR.
   3.1.6. Basic Plan. The basic plan consists of the five major paragraphs shown in Figure 3.7
   Additional paragraph headings may be included to fit the needs of the plan. The basic plan
   will be signed by the 88 ABW/CC. The five paragraphs of the basic plan must be listed in
18                                                    WPAFBI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2010


  every plan, even if they are not applicable. If they do not apply, “Not Applicable” will be
  inserted after the paragraph title (for example, “4. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS.
  Not Applicable.”). This method permits standardization and enables planners to refer
  immediately to a standard paragraph when seeking specific information.
  3.1.7. Attachments. Attachments to the basic plan listed in order of increasing detail are
  Annexes, Appendices, Tabs, and Exhibits. The basic plan should refer to each annex that has
  been prepared; however, information provided in the basic plan is not normally repeated in
  the attachments. If other attachments are used, the planner should refer to appendices in the
  text of the annex and to any tabs in the text of the appendix. The table of contents should
  contain a listing of all Annexes, Appendices, Tabs, Exhibits, and Maps. Annexes used for
  the plan should be listed on the final page of the basic plan after the 88 ABW/CC signature
  block. Other attachments (appendices, tabs, exhibits, or maps) are listed on the final page of
  any attachment that has further attachments.
     3.1.7.1. Annex. An Annex is produced by a functional area (Operations, Logistics, etc.)
     and describes the concept of mission support by the functional area. It contains detailed
     information for a specific organization or subject. Each annex will vary on the contents.
     All WPAFB plans will contain, as a minimum, Annex A (Task Organization) and Annex
     Z (Distribution). Per AFMAN 10-401V2, the letters “I” and “O” must not be used as
     annex designators. Annex format will be organized in accordance with AFMAN10-
     401V2. Deviations to this format may be approved by the WPAFB Plans Manager. The
     Annex format is identical to the Basic Plan format.
         3.1.7.1.1. The Task Organization annex lists all units that are required to act on the
         contents of the plan. The Task Organization annex is always listed as Annex A.
         Refer to Figure 3.8 for Task Organization annex format.
         3.1.7.1.2. OPSEC. OPSEC should be discussed briefly in the Plan Summary and
         Basic Plan.
             3.1.7.1.3. Distribution List. The distribution list informs users which agencies
             and headquarters should ensure access to the plan via the 88 ABW/XP Plans
             Library SharePoint site. As a minimum, the WPAFB Plans Manager will notify
             all tasked organizations, AFMC Command Center, WPAFB Crisis Action Team,
             WPAFB Emergency Operations Center and 88 ABW/XPW when a plan is
             published, reviewed and/or changed. Distribution to AFMC staff agencies may
             be required. Plan OPRs will check with their functionals to determine required
             distribution to higher headquarters. Additional distribution is determined by the
             plan OPR. Addressees must advise plan OPRs of necessary changes to the
             distribution list. The distribution list is designated Annex Z in WPAFB plans.
             Figure 3.9 shows the correct distribution annex format.
     3.1.7.2. Appendix. An appendix is a subordinate addition to an annex. It includes
     information too lengthy or detailed for the basic annex. Normally, each appendix is
     devoted to a major category of information. For example, if a plan requires more than
     one response option, a separate appendix could be used to address each option.
     Formatting for an appendix is identical to the Basic Plan and the Annex.
WPAFBI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2010                                                                   19


           3.1.7.3. Tab. A tab is a further subdivision of an appendix used to organize and
           clarify the presentation of detailed data. Tabs are prepared in the same general format
           as appendices.
       3.1.7.4. Exhibit. An exhibit is a further subdivision of a tab to enable the planner to
       organize the portrayal of greater levels of detail.
3.2. References. List documents that are required for complete understanding of the annex or
appendix. Do not duplicate references in annexes or appendices that are listed in the basic plan.
If no references are required, continue with the next paragraph. Additional information
concerning plan format is available in AFMAN 10-401V2.
3.3. Plan Marking It is imperative that plans are marked with their appropriate classification.
The highest classification level of CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, and TOP SECRET documents
must be displayed on the front and back cover. The front cover will contain classification
instruction to include: Derivative or Original Declassifier; Derivative From; Declassify On.
Each interior page will have either the highest classification of the document or classification of
that page displayed on the top and bottom. Each paragraph will be marked to indicate the
classification of that paragraph and any caveats such as NOFOR or RELTO. Further marking
guidance is found in ISOO Directive # 1, Classified National Security Information, DoD 5200.1-
R, Information Security Program, and the DoD/CAPCO marking guide.
   3.3.1. Headers. Starting after the Memorandum of Transmittal Letter, include a right aligned
   header on the rest of the document that reads “88TH AIR BASE WING (AFMC) WRIGHT-
   PATTERSON AFB, OHIO 45433,” bolded.
   3.3.2. Watermarks. All plans in the review process need to have a text watermark that reads
   “DRAFT” diagonally throughout the entire document until the document is published with a
   signature from the 88 ABW/CC.
   3.3.3. Unclassified. At a minimum, all plans generated by the 88 ABW will be marked
   “UNCLASSIFIED.” Mark plans with “UNCLASSIFIED” at the bottom of the front cover
   and the back cover, and the top and bottom of each page in the header and footer.
   3.3.4. For Official Use Only (FOUO). An unclassified document containing FOUO
   information shall be marked "For Official Use Only" at the bottom on the outside of the front
   cover (if any), on each page containing FOUO information, and on the outside of the back
   cover (if any). Each paragraph containing FOUO information shall be marked as such in
   accordance with DODR5400.7-R_AFMAN33-302, 21 October 2010 and AFI 31-401,
   Information Security Program Management.
3.4. Paragraph Numbering. Designations for subdividing and numbering paragraphs will use
a numeric system. (Ex: 3., 3.1., 3.1.1., 3.1.2., 4).
3.5. Page Numbering.
   3.5.1. Pages are numbered at the bottom center to indicate the page order within each
   element of the plan. Thus, page C-1-A-3 denotes page 3 of Tab A to Appendix 1 to Annex
   C.
   3.5.2. Each new “section” (basic plan, annex, appendix, tab, etc.) must start on a front (odd)
   page. Pages marked “THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK” will be inserted as
   needed to ensure this requirement happens.
 20                                                      WPAFBI10-401 21 DECEMBER 2010


   3.5.3. Plan covers and Memorandum of Transmittal will stand alone (nothing printed on the
   back). EXCEPTION: Page numbers and/or “THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT
   BLANK” may appear on the back of Memorandum of Transmittal.
3.6. Capitalization and Underlining Guidance.
   3.6.1. References to specific annexes and other attachments are in this format:         Initial
   Capitals.
   3.6.2. Paragraph titles are capitalized and underlined, as in this format: SOLID CAPITALS.
   3.6.3. Subparagraph titles are expressed as in this sample: Initial Capitals.
   3.6.4. Sub-subparagraphs and all subtitles are not underlined and are expressed as in this
   format: Initial Capitals. An exception to this rule applies where agencies are identified or
   tasked; these will be capitalized.
3.7. Text Spacing and Sizing. Text is single-spaced, Times New Roman font, 12 pt pitch.
However, a smaller font size may be used at the discretion of the plan OPR to conserve paper if
the plan is of an excessive length. No font size smaller than 10.5 pt pitch will be used in the
main body of the text. Margins will be set to 1 inch.
3.8. Dates. Each separate element of a plan must bear the date of issue or revision. Until a plan
is revised, all elements should bear the same date of issue.
3.9. Abbreviations. The first time a title, designation, or acronym is used in an element of a
plan that is not contained in the glossary, it must be spelled out and immediately followed by the
approved abbreviation, for example, Crisis Action Team (CAT). Within that element of the plan,
the abbreviation alone may be used thereafter.
