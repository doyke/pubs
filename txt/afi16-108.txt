7. ALP Selection/Nomination Methodology.
    7.1. Prioritization. Countries nominated to receive ALP scholarships will be prioritized by

    7.2. Key considerations.
       7.2.1. Combatant Command prioritized nominations (resulting from SAF/IAPX annual
       call for nominations).
       7.2.2. Board inputs/recommendations (i.e. SAF/IA regional divisions, AF/A5XX,
       AF/CC-POLAD).
       7.2.3. Supporting considerations/rationale. Amongst eligible countries with similar
       engagement priorities, consider the following factors:
           7.2.3.1. Foreign air force capability to effectively use ALP candidate (i.e. likelihood
           of appropriate follow on assignment in country’s air force).
           7.2.3.2. Foreign air force budget. A country with sufficient cash to purchase modern
           aircraft systems and flying training should not be considered as a high priority for this
           US Air Force program.
           7.2.3.3. Existing grant programs. A country receiving small US grant programs
           should have priority over larger US grant recipients.
           7.2.3.4. Existing security cooperation programs. A country with which the USAF
           has few people-to-people programs or initiatives (training programs, Personnel
           Exchange Program, military-to-military contacts) should have priority over countries
           with which the USAF has many programs.
           7.2.3.5. History of attendance. Every effort should be made to ensure distribution of
           ALP scholarships to maximize the engagement potential of the ALP.
           7.2.3.6. Number of quotas. Unless supporting rationale/justification warrants
           additional quotas, only one ALP quota will be allocated per country. Justification for
           multiple quotas must meet security cooperation objectives and must be approved by
           CSAF.
8. ALP Candidate Criteria. To achieve program goals, the USAF will encourage use of the
following criteria to choose ALP candidates:
    8.1. An ALP candidate should be a top graduate of the participating country’s air force
    academy or other young officer with potential to achieve top leadership positions in their air
    force.
    8.2. The USAF will accept second or third-year cadets on a case-by-case basis, provided the
    cadet is considered a member of the country’s air force and has a service commitment upon
    graduation from the academy.
    8.3. The USAF will consider participation of foreign graduates of the United States Air
    Force Academy on a case-by-case basis.

9. Program administration. ALP students are administered the same as International Military
Education and Training (IMET) students IAW AFI 16-105_IP, except that costs for ALP
students will be charged to USAF appropriations.
   9.1. Medical standards. Medical standards for flying in USAF aircraft will be IAW AFI
   16-105_IP with further guidance as outlined in AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and
   Standards.
   9.2. Language training: As stated in para 5.1, the ALP includes English language training.
   ALP candidates must meet established language capability requirements before beginning
   aviation training. Language pre-requisites established by AETC are currently 85 English
   Comprehension Level and Oral Proficiency Interview score of 2+/2+.
   9.3. Per diem/billeting/food/health services. Benefits and allowances are IAW AFI 16-105
   (I) for IMET students; however, all charges are to USAF appropriated funds.
   9.4. Dependents. As stated in AFI 16-105_IP and ALP agreements, international military
   students are encouraged not to bring dependents to the US during their training period. ALP
   student dependents will be considered unauthorized dependents IAW AFI 16-105 (I).
