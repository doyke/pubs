SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Instruction title has
been changed to more accurately reflect document contents. This revision establishes exercise
management products and organizations directed in Program Action Directive (PAD) 07-13
(paragraph 1.3.5); implements Service NEP participation directed in DoDI 3020.47,
(paragraph 1.3.6); eliminates Chapter 2 (Responsibilities) and incorporates revised exercise
program responsibilities into Chapter 1 (paragraph 1.4); removes the following chapters:
Chapter 4 (Master Scenario Event List (MSEL)), Chapter 5 (Air Force After-Action Reporting
System (AFAARS)), Chapter 6 (Air Force Remedial Action Program (AFRAP)), Chapter 7
(Staff and Training). The new Chapter 2 (Exercise Cycle) incorporates MSEL information
(paragraph 2.2.7) and After Action Reporting (AAR) guidance (paragraph 2.4). The new
Chapter 3 (Exercise Funding and Programming) provides new guidance regarding Service
Incremental Funding (SIF), Commercial Ticket Program (CTP), and Port Handling/Inland
Transportation (PH/IT) procedures based on consolidating NEP/JEP funding into the Office of
the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Combatant Commander Exercise and Engagement (CE2)
program. The new Chapter 4 identifies prescribed and adopted forms. The Instruction also
adds Attachments 2, 3, and 4 addressing the AFJECT, EIPT, and EGOSG.

(AFGSC) This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It
defines AFGSC/A3X as the HQ OPR for AFGSC exercises and the interface for exercises with
Headquarters Air Force (HAF). It establishes and defines objectives for the AFGSC Exercise
Program (AFGSCEP). Chapter 1 updates obsolete/outdated references and procedures as well
the frequency of the Exercise Working Group (EWG). In addition, the requirements for the use

                   EXERCISE GUIDELINES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Purpose. Exercises play an essential role in preparing United States Air Force (USAF)
forces to conduct air, space, and cyberspace operations and perform their mission essential tasks.
This Instruction provides direction and additional policy guidance regarding Air Force
participation in the National Exercise Program (NEP) and the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff
(CJCS)-designated exercises that constitute the Joint Exercise Program (JEP). It supports the
Strategic Plan for Transforming DoD Training, CJCSM 3500.03B, Joint Training Manual for
the Armed Forces of the United States, and CJCSI 3500.01E, Joint Training Policy and
Guidance for the Armed Forces of the United States. It defines actions and responsibilities
during the exercise cycle and outlines procedures for programming and budgeting exercise
funds. It establishes organizations and processes to help manage Air Force NEP/JEP exercise
participation and support.
1.1. (AFGSC)Purpose. The purpose of the Air Force Global Strike Command Exercise
Program (AFGSCEP) is to support the Air Force Exercise Program, to meet the training
requirements and objectives of AFGSC, to support the training requirements of United States
Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), and to provide continuing and advanced training of
mission capable forces through the Joint and National Exercise Programs.
1.2. Objective. Air Force units participate in NEP and JEP exercises to hone and refine their
execution of mission essential and supporting tasks, validate training, improve response
capabilities, and enhance and evaluate readiness. The Air Force goal is to optimize the benefits
of participating in these exercises.
1.2. (AFGSC)Objective. The objective of the AFGSCEP is based on the AFGSC Training Plan
and is to train AFGSC personnel based on Joint, Air Force, and AFGSC Mission Essential Tasks
in an operational environment with other Combatant Commands, MAJCOMS, and Services. The
specific AFGSCEP sub-objectives are contained in paragraphs 1.2.1. and 1.2.2.
   1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Train exercise participants on the utility, capabilities, limitations,
   threats and vulnerabilities of current weapons systems.
   1.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) Demonstrate the readiness of assigned forces while performing the
   current conventional and nuclear operations in compliance with current doctrine.
1.3. Exercise Guidelines.
   1.3.1. Concept. Exercises must embody a “train the way we fight” philosophy and should
   exercise actual command relationships as much as possible. Exercises should provide
   opportunities to assess real-world capabilities consistent with safety, security, and overall
   exercise objectives. When appropriate, exercises should also incorporate other requirements
   and operational challenges, such as logistics, support, force protection, and the ability to
   operate in a degraded/contaminated environment, including biological, radiological, and
   nuclear (CBRN) environments. Whenever possible, exercises should seek to employ and
   evaluate current or proposed plans, policies, procedures, processes, Warfighter Challenges,
   and doctrine.
6                                                   AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013


    1.3.1. (AFGSC) Concept. AFGSC exercise planners will replicate the operational
    environment as closely as possible for all exercise events, providing the participants the
    opportunity to achieve the appropriate training objectives. Simulations will be minimized
    and reserved for those actions, which are too costly (i.e., resource expenditure, potential risk,
    etc.) or impractical to perform in an exercise situation.
    1.3.2. Conditions. Exercises give commanders an opportunity to assess the ability of their
    units to perform their missions and should be conducted and examined under “no-fault”
    conditions. Exercise participants should have the “freedom to fail” within the bounds of safe
    operations and the need to meet exercise objectives. Per CJCSI 3500.01E, assessments for
    CE2 exercise will be recorded in the Joint Training Information Management System
    (JTIMS). Unless part of a formal inspection, do not grade individual or unit performance.
    Formal inspections, such as operational readiness inspections (ORIs), may be conducted
    during exercises provided graded events are clearly identified to all exercise participants and
    grading will only affect inspected units.
    1.3.2. (AFGSC) Conditions. Commanders are responsible for assessing their units’
    readiness using established performance criteria found in applicable directives. Unit
    assessors/observers, when practical, will be used during exercises to build the commander’s
    unit capability assessment, and to gather lessons learned to improve unit processes and
    procedures. Formal inspections within exercises will be coordinated between AFGSC/IG
    and AFGSC/A3X to ensure exercise events coincide with inspection requirements.
    1.3.3. Linking Exercises. To take advantage of the synergy that exists when exercises
    require similar skill sets and have common venues, scenarios, and objectives, Air Force
    Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Field Operating Agencies (FOA), and Direct Reporting
    Units (DRUs) should consider linking their sponsored exercises with CJCS-sponsored,
    CCDR-sponsored, or other appropriate exercises whenever possible.
    1.3.3. (AFGSC) Linking Exercises. When opportunities arise, and with MAJCOM
    approval NAFs and Wings should use interagency Joint or National level exercises to fulfill
    their AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and
    Operations, exercise requirements, and other required training such as relocations for
    continuity of operations (COOP). Submit requests to HQ AFGSC/A3X to ensure
    participation is consistent with exercise and event support priorities and HQ AFGSC/A7XE
    for approval of exercise credit. Linking AFGSC exercises to Joint or National exercises
    increases exercise fidelity, command and control play, and makes use of available Joint or
    National level exercise funding. The combined planning of exercises and wargames on a
    case-by-case basis can also save resources.
       1.3.3.1. Scheduling. Participating in NEP and JEP exercises and also supporting Air
       Force-sponsored exercises places considerable stress on Air Force units and often strains
       available assets. Force providers must determine their ability to support all exercise
       requirements as they develop their exercise schedules and make exercise commitments.
       1.3.3.1. (AFGSC) Scheduling. The AFGSC exercise scheduling and resources process
       takes place within the AFGSC Exercise Working Group (EWG). The AFGSC EWG
       determines AFGSC unit exercise participation. Following this determination, AFGSC
       resources are appropriately applied. AFGSC Directors, NAF and Wing Commanders
       should send empowered representatives to the AFGSC Annual Scheduling Conference to
AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013                                                          7


     ensure units are not overburdened by events and that all required unit Mission Essential
     Tasks are trained to the Commander’s satisfaction. The objective of this process is to
     ensure AFGSC and Component Command responsibilities to HQ USAF and
     USSTRATCOM are met within the AFGSC activity framework and available resources.

   1.3.4. Support Requirements.
      1.3.4.1. Participants. Exercises provide participants the opportunity to practice actions
      and procedures in an instructive environment. To ensure the appropriate personnel
      benefit from this exercise experience, role players and substitutes for key personnel
      should be kept to a minimum.
      1.3.4.2. War Reserve Materiel (WRM). WRM may be used to provide Indirect Mission
      Support for Joint Chiefs of Staff and Air Force exercises with proper
      approval/authorization and funding, as outlined in AFI 25-101, War Reserve Materiel
      (WRM) Program Guidance and Procedures. WRM assets will not be used for exercises
      without appropriate release authority.
         1.3.4.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) Weapons Movement Procedures. AFGSC units will
         request the use of War Reserve (WR) weapons during local and Higher Headquarters
         Directed (HHD) nuclear exercises unless otherwise directed by the AFGSC/CC IAW
         paragraph 1.3.4.2.2. Once approved, WR will be made available to increase

        proficiency and ensure continued compliance with Weapon System Safety Rules
        (WSSR).
        1.3.4.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC units will submit the use of WR weapons
        request NLT 35 days prior to the start of the exercise to AFGSC/A3 and
        AFGSC/A4/7, with an informational copy to their owning NAF/TF (Figure 1.3). The
        completed request will be classified as "SECRET-Formerly Restricted Data". In
        addition, provide the wing's security plan for the exercise with each request.

            1.3.4.2.3.5. (Added-AFGSC) Return WR weapons to secure storage as soon as
            practicable upon completion of a readiness exercise.
     1.3.4.3. Preparation. Exercise planners should review operational, logistical, support,
     and force protection requirements, command relationships, applicable plans, After
     Actions Reports (AAR), lessons learned databases, corrective action reports, observation
     reports, and guidance from higher headquarters to determine appropriate exercise
     objectives and ensure the exercise design supports meeting these objectives.
     1.3.4.4. Environmental Compliance. Exercise sponsors will ensure exercises conducted
     in the United States, its territories, and possessions comply with applicable Federal, State,
     interstate, and local environmental requirements. Air Force exercise planners will ensure
     compliance with AFI 32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP) for
     all Air Force-sponsored exercises. Exercises conducted at Department of Defense (DoD)
     installations in foreign countries will comply with AFI 32-7006, Environmental Program
     in Foreign Countries.
     1.3.4.5. Contractor Support for Exercises. The contract statement of work is the source
     document for contractor duties and responsibilities. Contractor support for exercises
     must be confined to the services specified by contract or negotiated during the exercise
     planning process.
     1.3.4.6. Status of Forces Agreement for Combined Exercises. Whenever USAF forces
     participate with other countries in any combined exercise, the United States should have a
     status of forces agreement (SOFA) or similar arrangement with all participating
     countries. If a SOFA does not exist with any country, such an agreement should be
     negotiated and concluded in advance of the exercise in accordance with DoD Directive
     (DoDD) 5530.3, International Agreements, AFI 51-701, Negotiating, Concluding,
     Reporting, and Maintaining International Agreements, and AFJI 51-706, Status of Forces
     Policies, Procedures, and Information. If in doubt as to the existence of such an
     agreement with regard to a particular country or for assistance in preparing an agreement,
     contact Secretary of the Air Force, Office of the General Counsel, Deputy General
     Counsel for International Affairs (SAF/GCI).
  1.3.5. Exercise Management. The Air Force will develop the following products and use
  the following organizations to optimize exercise support and participation.
     1.3.5.1. Exercise Management Products.
        1.3.5.1.1. Weight of Effort (WoE). The WoE is a prioritized scoring matrix
        developed to assist Air Force senior leaders in making personnel and equipment
        apportionment decisions for exercise support functions, such as Air and Space
        Operations Center (AOC) augmentation, exercise control group support, and
        modeling and simulation (M&S) support. The WoE utilizes quantitative grading
        criteria to identify which exercises provide the greatest training benefit for USAF
        units. The WoE is not intended to be used for prioritization of funding.

        1.3.5.1.2. Global Exercise Schedule (GES). The GES is the annual schedule of
        exercises requiring support from Air Force exercise control and M&S organizations.
        Air Combat Command (ACC) develops and maintains the GES.
     1.3.5.2. Exercise Management Organizations.
        1.3.5.2.1. Air Force Joint Exercise Coordination Team (AFJECT). The AFJECT is
        an action officer-level working group responsible for developing a validated GES.
        Additional guidance is at Attachment 2.
        1.3.5.2.1. (AFGSC) Air Force Joint Exercise Coordination Team (AFJECT).
        AFGSC/A3X will represent AFGSC at the AFJECT. Scheduling decisions made as
        part of this team will be disseminated throughout AFGSC units during the AFGSC
        EWG. The EWG is the primary body for coordinating all exercise activities
        supported by AFGSC.
        1.3.5.2.2. Exercise Integrated Process Team (EIPT). The EIPT is a multi-command,
        colonel-level organization responsible for coordinating and addressing cross-
        MAJCOM exercise issues and developing the WoE. Additional guidance is at
        Attachment 3.
        1.3.5.2.3. Exercise General Officer Steering Group (EGOSG). The EGOSG is an
        executive level forum to address exercise-related issues and AF support to CSAF,
        Combatant Commander (CCDR), and MAJCOM/CC exercise requirements and
        priorities. Additional guidance is at Attachment 4.
        1.3.5.2.3. (AFGSC) Exercise General Officer Steering Group (EGSOG).
        AFGSC/A3 is the designated AFGSC representative to the EGOSG. AFGSC/A3X
        will provide direct support to the A3 and will prepare any required decision packages.
  1.3.6. National Exercise Program (NEP). DoD Components will support the NEP in
  accordance with DoDI 3020.47, DoD Participation in the National Exercise Program (NEP).
     1.3.6.1. Scope. The NEP is run by the Department of Homeland Security and provides a
     framework for prioritizing and focusing Federal exercise activities. It is the principal
     mechanism for examining the overall preparedness of the United States Government
     (USG) and enables Federal departments and agencies to examine and evaluate national
     policies, plans, and strategies during the management of domestic catastrophic events,
     such as CBRN incidents, as a result of attack or natural disaster.
     1.3.6.2. Tiers. The NEP Implementation Plan categorizes exercises into the following
     tiers that reflect priorities for interagency participation:
        1.3.6.2.1. Tier I. This is the highest priority level. Tier I exercises are centered on
        White House directed, USG-wide issues and require the participation of appropriate
        department and agency principals along with their operations centers and staffs.
        1.3.6.2.2. Tier II. These are Federal department/agency exercises with a focus on
        USG strategy, policy, and procedural issues meriting priority for national and
        regional Federal interagency participation. Each department or agency will determine
        their level of actual or simulated support for NEP Tier II exercises.
AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013                                                              13


          1.3.6.2.3. Tier III. These are other Federal exercises focused on plans, policies and
          procedures at the regional, operational, or tactical level not requiring broad
          interagency headquarters-level involvement. Participation at the national level is at
          the discretion of each department or agency.
          1.3.6.2.4. Tier IV. These are exercises in which State and local government, and/or
          private sector entities are the primary exercise audience.
      1.3.6.3. National Level Exercise (NLE). The NLE is the single annual operations-based
      NEP Tier I exercise and requires the participation of all appropriate department and
      agency principals.
      1.3.6.4. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) serves as the DoD POC to the
      NEP and orchestrates overall DoD NEP execution.
          1.3.6.4.1. The Air Force will participate in NEP Tier I exercises when appropriate
          given the scenario or when tasked by either the ASD (HD&ASA) or by CJCS or his
          or her representative.
          1.3.6.4.2. Unless directed by higher authority, Air Force participation in Tier II, III,
          and IV NEP exercises is at the discretion of MAJCOM and unit leadership.
          1.3.6.4.3. A tasked MAJCOM will notify AF/A3O-ATT and the requesting agency
          when they cannot provide requested exercise support to any NEP exercise.
      1.3.6.5. AF/A3O-ATT will monitor Air Force participation in NEP exercises.
      1.3.6.6. Air Force organizations that participate in a NEP exercise will:
          1.3.6.6.1. Fully support exercise planning, execution, and evaluation.
          1.3.6.6.2. Provide trusted agents, as needed, to design and control the exercise.
1.4. Nuclear Exercises.
   1.4.1. MAJCOM/CCs are responsible to ensure MAJCOM nuclear exercises are conducted
   properly. MAJCOM/CCs are the waiver approval authority, unless delegated to the CV, for
   movement/cancellation of scheduled nuclear exercises which are MAJCOM directed or
   higher.
   1.4.2. NAF/CCs are responsible to ensure NAF nuclear exercises are conducted properly.
   NAF/CCs are the waiver approval authority, unless delegated to the CV, for
   movement/cancellation of scheduled nuclear exercises which are NAF directed or higher.
   1.4.3. (Added-AFGSC) Nuclear Exercise Purpose. AFGSC’s purpose for nuclear
   exercises is to ensure units are ready to implement applicable OPLANs in support of
   combatant commanders. AFGSC Wings will accomplish at least two strategic readiness
   exercises each fiscal year. The Wing Commander should conduct additional local generation
   exercises at their discretion to ensure the readiness of the wing.
   1.4.4. (Added-AFGSC) Nuclear Exercise Objective. AFGSC’s objective is to exercise
   units with an emphasis on real-world tasking, policies and procedures. Through minimum
   simulation and conducting effective lessons learned procedures, force readiness and combat
   capability will be enhanced. The exercise scenario, objectives and execution will reflect the
   requirements of the applicable OPLAN tasking and AFGSC instructions.

     subsequent MAJCOM sponsored exercises.
  1.4.6. (Added-AFGSC) Exercise Tasking, Credit, and Waiver.
     1.4.6.1. (Added-AFGSC) [Bomber Only] B-52/B-2 units will make every attempt
     during strategic readiness exercises to generate to the bomber priority list (BPL) tasking
     IAW published Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statements. An additional FTX
     tasking may require a substitution for a previously tasked FTX-committed sortie and
     therefore a change to generation flow timing. Upon completion of the exercise units may
     fly surge missions (optional).
     1.4.6.2. (Added-AFGSC) If generating less than the applicable OPLAN tasked
     requirement, explain and advise of a get well plan to AFGSC/A3X and either TF204 or
     TF 214, whichever is applicable.
     1.4.6.3. (Added-AFGSC) Units are not relieved from their exercise requirements until
     an official waiver is granted from AFGSC/A3 through AFGSC/A3X.
     1.4.6.4. (Added-AFGSC) [Bomber Only] Squadrons deployed to Forward Operating
     Locations (FOL) are exempt from exercise generation. Simulated generation of units at
     an FOL will be Command Post Exercise (CPX) or IAW deployed COCOM/OPCON
     guidance. Exercise Memoranda of Agreement (MOA), if applicable, will apply.

                                           Chapter 2

                                     EXERCISE CYCLE

2.1. Exercise Cycle. The exercise cycle consists of the planning, execution, and evaluation
phases needed to create, conduct and assess an exercise.
2.1. (AFGSC)Exercise Cycle. The AFGSC Exercise Planning Cycle is designed to facilitate
the needs of AFGSC units to efficiently meet the objectives and requirements of the AFGSC
Training Plan using the limited resources available to them. This is done using two sequential
scheduling processes, long term and medium, as well as a complementary Combat Air Forces
(CAF) scheduling process done in conjunction with Air Combat Command (ACC).
   2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) Long Term. AFGSC/A3X will convene the AFGSC EWG semi-
   annually following the Worldwide Joint Training Scheduling Conference (WJTSC) and Air
   Force Joint Exercise Coordination Team (AFJECT), see Figure 2.1. below. The AFGSC
   EWG uses the Global Exercise Schedule to further develop and evaluate a long range
   AFGSC specific moving 3-year schedule/calendar to facilitate forecasting, funding,
   programming, training and manpower requirements. The EWG will assess the AFGSC
   capability to support events based on the AFGSC Training Plan, AFGSC objectives, AFGSC
   Mission Essential Tasks (METs) and the training requirements of USSTRATCOM as
   specified in the USSTRATCOM Joint Training Plan. The EWG develops the 3-year AFGSC
   Event Calendar which is the basis for AFGSC inputs to the CAF Scheduling Integrated
   Process Team Aviation Schedule Build process and inclusion of AFGSC exercises and
   participation on the CPS.
       2.1.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) After the 2nd Qtr of the FY WJTSC, the combatant
       commands, CSAs and National Guard Bureau should update their exercise information in
       Joint Training Information Management System (JTIMS). Exercise data must be
       published by the data owner to provide full visibility across the joint training community.
       Data owners are able to coordinate and manage their draft data within their organizational
       user community in JTIMS prior to publication. Once all combatant commands and CSAs
       have published their events, JTIMS provides a comprehensive event calendar to support
       scheduling and deconfliction of employment and milestone dates.
       2.1.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) The EWG should occur before the relevant CPS build cycle
       so as to discuss and determine AFGSCs, NAFs and Wings agreed upon participation in
       events for that upcoming CPS build cycle.
       2.1.1.3. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC inputs to the CPS are based on the results of the
       EWG and managed by AFGSC/A3X with coordination through AFGSC/A3B. No
       AFGSC unit will undertake any event appearing on the CPS and/or meeting the criteria in
       paragraph 1.5.7.3.8 without the event being approved by the EWG and/or coordinating
       with AFGSC/A3X.
   2.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC Exercise Working Group (EWG). The EWG is the
   primary body for coordination of all external events supported by AFGSC and manages the
   AFGSC scheduling and resources process. This process determines event participation and
   applies resources to support those events. The objective of this process is to ensure AFGSC
AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013                                                           25


  MAJCOM and Component Command responsibilities to USSTRATCOM are met with the
  AFGSC event framework and available resources.
     2.1.2.1. (Added-AFGSC) The EWG is composed of representatives from all AFGSC
     elements operating under the sponsorship of the Director of Operations (AFGSC/A3).
     AFGSC/IG is also an integral member of the EWG due to their Gatekeeper function.
     EWG meetings are conducted on a semi-annual basis following the Spring Joint Staff
     Worldwide Joint Training and Scheduling Conferences (WJTSC). Follow-up meetings
     will occur as needed. The Team Chair, AFGSC/A3X, has authority over team members
     with respect to cross-functional scheduling and tasking issues. Tasking may also originate
     from regular staff channels. The Team Chair will be the spokesperson for the EWG
     membership and forward all team decisions to the AFGSC/A3 and AFGSC/CC.
     2.1.2.2. (Added-AFGSC) Function.         The EWG will meet and act on the
     recommendations of AFGSC/A3X relative to the scheduling and resource application for
     events. The approved list of events and resources is considered the draft AFGSC Event
     Calendar.
     2.1.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) EWG Membership will consist of the EWG Team Chair from
     AFGSC/A3X and representatives from each AFGSC element that has scheduling and/or
     tasking responsibility or is tasked to participate in exercises. Directors/Commanders will
     appoint representatives to the EWG and empower them to commit resources and make

Calendar.




2.2. Planning Phase. The planning phase encompasses all aspects of building an exercise and
as a minimum should address the following areas:
   2.2.1. Exercise concept. The exercise concept guides and focuses the planning effort. It
   identifies the exercise type (e.g. command post exercise (CPX), field training exercise (FTX),
   etc.), the major participants, the level of exercise play, the broad scenario profile and the
   plans, procedures, and activities that are the primary exercise focus.

     341MW                   Grizzly
     2.2.1.1. (Added-AFGSC) For all local nuclear and conventional exercises, MAREs,
     security forces exercises, Response Task Force (RTF), Nuclear Surety Exercises (NSE),
     Wings and NAFs will use the exercise naming convention in Table 2.1.
  2.2.2. Exercise objectives. Exercise objectives are the precise, action-oriented statements
  that identify the goals for the exercise. Objectives should be developed around tasks from
  applicable Mission Essential Task Lists (METLs). When participating in linked exercises,
  Air Force exercise objectives should be compatible with those of the other exercise(s).
  2.2.2. (AFGSC) All AFGSC organizations forward desired exercise objectives to the
  AFGSC POC. The POC is the single point-of-contact for coordinating exercise objectives
  with higher headquarters and subordinate units. The POC in coordination with the ECT will
  establish AFGSC-specific objectives for each exercise. AFGSC exercise program objectives
  contained in paragraph 1.2 are intended to provide overarching guidance for the development
  of exercise objectives.
  2.2.3. Exercise plans (EXPLANs). EXPLANs should typically follow the standard
  Operations Plan (OPLAN) format found in CJCSM 3122.03C, Joint Operation Planning and
  Execution System (JOPES), Vol II--Planning Formats and Guidance, and contain pertinent
  annexes. When appropriate, participating Air Force organizations (HAF, MAJCOM, etc)
  will assist the exercise sponsor with EXPLAN development. Depending on exercise
  complexity, duration and level of participation, Air Force organizations may, at their
  discretion, create an organizational EXPLAN to clarify exercise requirements and
  responsibilities.
  2.2.4. Exercise control. Exercise execution is managed by controllers who are
  knowledgeable in the timing and content of exercise events. Air Force planners should
  determine the number and location of control elements and the exercise control procedures
  needed to provide overall exercise management and support the accomplishment of Air Force
  objectives. Planners should prepare and provide exercise controllers the support materials
  needed to manage exercise execution.
  2.2.5. Training. Exercises are a training program adjunct and provide an opportunity to
  practice trained actions and procedures during simulated situations in a controlled
  environment. Exercise organizations must determine the training their exercise players
  require to properly prepare them for a particular exercise and then ensure the training is
  accomplished before the exercise.
28                                              AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013


  2.2.6. Exercise Player Materials. One of the goals of the exercise program is to practice,
  validate, and reinforce established procedures. To help support this goal, whenever possible,
  exercise information should be communicated using established procedures. Exercise-
  specific player materials should only be created when normal communication tools or
  procedures do not exist to provide required exercise information.
     2.2.6.1. Exercise player material must not divulge trusted agent information or release
     any event information before the scheduled time of the event.
  2.2.7. Master Scenario Event List (MSEL). Typically, the MSEL is a chronological
  database of planned events and expected player actions that exercise controllers use to
  manage and guide the exercise to achieve exercise objectives.
     2.2.7.1. The MSEL is the scenario game plan for the exercise and should only be
     accessible to trusted agents and must not be released to exercise players.
     2.2.7.1. (AFGSC) AFGSC will use the Joint Master Scenario Event List (JMSEL), to
     the maximum extent possible, for all exercises supported by AFGSC. AFGSC elements
     should ensure access to the SIPRNET and the JMSEL as soon as exercise planning
     begins.
     2.2.7.2. The exercise sponsoring organization is responsible for directing and overseeing
     MSEL development and creating and maintaining the MSEL database.
         2.2.7.2.1. Trusted agents from participating Air Force organizations will review the
         MSEL and ensure planned events support Air Force objectives.
             2.2.7.2.1.1. Air Force planners will coordinate on events that require Air Force
             participation and, when appropriate, create or change events to meet Air Force
             exercise requirements.
             2.2.7.2.1.2. When necessary, planners will attend MSEL Development and/or
             Synchronization Conferences to oversee scenario development and execution
             coordination.
  2.2.8. Trusted Agents. Trusted agents are subject matter experts who are given advance
  knowledge of exercise scenario details for the purpose of assisting with exercise development
  and planning.
     2.2.8.1. To maintain the integrity of exercise information, organizations should limit the
     number of trusted agents to the absolute minimum required to support proper planning.
         2.2.8.1.1. To maintain exercise planning continuity, trusted agents should be capable
         of serving from the start of exercise planning through execution.
         2.2.8.1.2. Trusted agents should not be principal players during exercise execution
         since advance knowledge of exercise events can significantly decrease the benefit
         players receive from an exercise.
     2.2.8.2. As a minimum, trusted agent information is For Official Use Only and should
     remain close-hold within the exercise planning community. Exercise information should
     not be released outside the planning community without the approval of the primary
     planning staff of the sponsoring organization for an exercise.
AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013                                                              29


   2.2.9. Exercise planners. Planners must be knowledgeable in the procedures, plans, and
   processes being exercised.
       2.2.9.1. The following references provide detailed information on the Joint Training
       System (JTS) and the Joint Event Life Cycle (JELC) and can assist exercise planners in
       the design, conduct and evaluation of exercises:
          2.2.9.1.1. CJCSI 3500.01E, Joint Training Policy and Guidance for the Armed
          Forces of the United States.
          2.2.9.1.2. CJCSI 3500.02, Universal Joint Task List Policy and Guidance for the
          Armed Forces of the United States.
          2.2.9.1.3. CJCSM 3500.03B, Joint Training Manual (JTM) for the Armed Forces of
          the United States.
   2.2.10. Observers. Observers are a vital link in the exercise process. They ensure exercise
   objectives are met, provide on-the-spot instruction and capture lessons learned and/or best
   practices for the after-action report and inclusion in the Joint Lessons Learned Information
   System (JLLIS). They can also recommend and coordinate event changes when required
   during exercise execution.
   2.2.11. Communication and Testing. Communication Setup and Testing are important
   exercise preparation steps and should include validation of all certifications and
   accreditations, end-to-end communications checks, and systems interoperability verification.
2.3. Execution Phase. The formal execution phase begins with deployment of exercise
participants or STARTEX and continues until ENDEX.
   2.3.1. Controllers manage the direction, pace, and intensity of exercise play in accordance
   with the exercise control plan established by the exercise sponsoring organization.
       2.3.1.1. When required, an Air Force Exercise Control Group (AFECG) will oversee and
       manage the exercise activity of Air Force exercise participants.
          2.3.1.1.1. The AFECG will not include exercise players and will be tailored to
          support the size and scope of the exercise and meet the exercise needs of participating
          Air Force organizations.
       2.3.1.2. White Cell. Since all organizations do not participate in every exercise, White
       Cell personnel will replicate the actions or inputs of non-participating organizations that
       are needed to keep exercise activities on track. White Cell personnel will not be exercise
       players but are trusted agents and may also perform controller functions.
   2.3.2. Exercise Reporting. Exercises provide an opportunity to practice procedures and
   evaluate their effectiveness. All exercise participants, to include observers and controllers,
   should note strengths and weaknesses encountered in any area during exercise planning or
   execution and identify these using the prescribed lessons learned and after actions processes.
2.4. Evaluation Phase. The evaluation phase is a critical part of the exercise process and
enables participants to evaluate and assess exercise actions, propose changes, and share this
information with others. After Action Reports (AARs) and Lessons Learned (L2) actions are
key elements of this phase.

  2.4.1. AARs. Participating Air Force organizations should develop an AAR that
  summarizes exercise activities, evaluates actions, identifies strengths and weaknesses, and
  makes recommendations, as appropriate.
     2.4.1.1. Participating Air Force organizations will follow the guidance in AFI 90-1601,
     Air Force Lessons Learned Program, for posting and forwarding AARs.
     2.4.1.2. (Added-AFGSC) AFGSC subordinate units will submit AAR/L2 for validation
     through unit chain of command within 30 days of event completion. Copies will be sent
     to HQ AFGSC/A3 and HQ AFGSC/A9.
  2.4.2. Lessons Learned. The Air Force Office of Lessons Learned (AF/A9L) is the OPR
  for the Air Force Lessons Learned Process (AFL2P).
  2.4.2. (AFGSC) AFGSC Lessons Learned Division (AFGSC/A9L) is AFGSC’s OPR.
     2.4.2.1. Unless otherwise directed by exercise protocols, all participating Air Force units
     will comply with the observation, collection, reporting, validation, dissemination, and
     tracking procedures contained in AFI 90-1601.
  2.4.3. The    Air      Force    Joint     Lessons    Learned Information System
  (https://www.jllis.mil/USAF) is the Air Force and DoD system of record for the
  management of all Air Force observations, L2, and AARs.

                                         Chapter 3

                     EXERCISE FUNDING AND PROGRAMMING

3.1. General Information.
   3.1.1. The Combatant Commander Exercise and Engagement (CE2) account funds Air Force
   participation in Joint Exercise Program (JEP) exercises. The CE2 account is programmed by
   the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel & Readiness (OUSD (P&R)) and
   is managed by the Joint Staff (JS)/J-7 with support from US Joint Forces Command
   (USJFCOM).
   3.1.2. Exercise funding and programming actions occur within the DoD biennial Planning,
   Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process.
   3.1.3. Air Force organizations will comply with the JEP provisions in CJCSI 3511.01A,
   Joint Exercise Transportation Program.
3.2. Combatant Commander Exercise and Engagement (CE2) Account.
   3.2.1. The CE2 account provides funds for the following types of exercise activities:
      3.2.1.1. Incremental Expenses. CE2 provides Service Incremental Funding (SIF) to pay
      for the incremental O&M activities incurred solely for, or as a direct result of, planning
      for or taking part in a CE2-funded exercise. Valid incremental activities include such
      items as lodging, per diem, non-aviation fuel, consumable supplies, contract support, and
      communications. It does not include costs funded in other AF accounts, such as flying
      hours.
      3.2.1.2. Transportation. Exercise transportation includes airlift, sealift, Port Handling
      (PH), Inland Transportation (IT), and the Commercial Ticket Program (CTP).
      Transportation funding generally covers the cost of transporting personnel and equipment
      from a unit’s home station to the exercise area and return. Commercial air travel from
      home station to and from the aerial port of embarkation (APOE), however, is a Service
      responsibility. Active duty, ANG, and AFRC forces can receive CE2 Transportation
      funds.
          3.2.1.2.1. Port Handling (PH). Port handling includes commercial contract expenses
          to receive or dispatch cargo for an exercise at Port of Embarkation (POE) and Port of
          Debarkation (POD) associated with Military Sealift Command (MSC) for sealift and
          Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) for commercial shipping.
          PH expenses include documentation, terminal handling, and stevedoring.
          3.2.1.2.2. Inland Transportation (IT). Inland transportation funds purchase approved
          point-to-point transportation service associated with the movement of exercise
          participants and cargo, between the units’ home base/installation to and from a
          POE/POD and to or from the exercise area, by commercial-for-hire firms when
          organic transportation is not available or cost effective. Movement is by surface
          transportation (rail, highway, and inland waterway).          Using vehicles where
          commercial drivers are included in the lease/ticket price is permissible. The leasing
          of commercial vehicles (e.g., passenger vans), however, is specifically excluded and
 32                                              AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013


         should not be confused with commercial-for-hire firms, including bus lines.
         Transportation expenses associated with temporary duty, exercise conferences, and
         air travel are specifically excluded from IT funding.
         3.2.1.2.3. Commercial Ticket Program (CTP). This program supports individual
         commercial air travel during exercise execution when military airlift or commercial
         air charter cannot satisfy the sponsoring command’s transportation requirements.
         CTP is used only when United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM)-
         provided common-user transportation cannot satisfy the CCDR-validated exercise
         Time-Phased Force Deployment Data (TPFDD). CTP funds can only be used to
         purchase commercial airline tickets. CTP funds do not cover per diem or movement
         to the APOE or from the APOD. Once CTP requirements are determined for a
         particular exercise, USTRANSCOM will post the CTP authorization message on their
         Single Mobility System (SMS) website.
   3.2.2. AF/A3O-ATT is responsible for managing the disbursement of CE2 funds associated
   with Air Force participation in JEP exercises.
   3.2.2. (AFGSC) AFGSC/A3X will receive CE2 funds from AF/A3O-AI and will disburse
   this funding to AFGSC units.
      3.2.2.1. Funding for JEP exercises is based on requirements identified in the Joint
      Training Information Management System (JTIMS). Exercise sponsors, planners, and
      participants should ensure the accurate and timely entry of required JTIMS data.
      3.2.2.2. AF/A3O-ATT will use Emergency and Special Project (ESP) codes to track CE2
      expenditures by exercise. To facilitate exercise expenditure accounting, Air Force
      organizations will ensure that all exercise fund cites contain the proper ESP code.
      3.2.2.3. (Added-AFGSC) Units, NAFs and Functional Area Managers (FAM) will
      provide annual and projected (3-5 year) CE2 funding requirements to AFGSC/A3X at the
      Annual Scheduling Conference or at any Quarterly Update Conference to ensure
      adequate funding is requested for JEP exercise participation and that AFGSC speaks with
      a single voice for exercise funding.
3.3. CE2 Funds Management.
   3.3.1. PH/IT Funds.
      3.3.1.1. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will manage the obligation and distribution of PH/IT
      funds.
      3.3.1.2. Transportation Account Codes (TAC). MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs should use
      TACs to fund PH/IT requirements whenever possible. When a TAC is not viable,
      MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will request PH/IT funding per paragraph 3.3.1.3.
      3.3.1.3. Funding Request. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU exercise planners will send a PH/IT
      funding request to AF/A3O-ATT (afa3oatt.workflow@pentagon.af.mil) as soon as the
      PH/IT need is known. The PH/IT funding request will include the exercise name,
      number of passengers and/or total weight of cargo (in short tons), and the estimated cost.
         3.3.1.3.1. AF/A3O-ATT will forward the PH/IT request to JS/J7 (JEXD). The JS
         Comptroller will post the funds on the Program Budget Accounting System (PBAS)
AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013                                                         33


          for the respective MAJCOM/FOA/DRU.           MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs are then
          responsible for getting funds to the appropriate units and for tracking PH/IT
          obligations by exercise name and ESP code.
   3.3.2. CTP Funds.
       3.3.2.1. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will manage the obligation and distribution of CTP
       funds.
       3.3.2.2. Funding Request. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit their CTP requests IAW
       AF/A3O-ATT-issued guidance.
          3.3.2.1.1. JS/J7 will process CTP requests and distribute CTP funds IAW the most
          current JS/J7 Joint Exercise Transportation Program, Commercial Ticket Program
          Implementation Guidance.
   3.3.3. SIF Funds.
       3.3.3.1. AF/A3O-ATT will oversee the distribution of               SIF    funds   and
       MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will manage the obligation of SIF funds.
       3.3.3.2. Funding Request.   MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will follow SIF procedures in
       paragraph 3.5.
   3.3.4. CE2 funds are authorized to support specific approved exercise expenses and may not
   be redirected to fund any other activities. MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs must track PH/IT, CTP,
   and SIF obligations separately.
3.4. Exercise Funds Responsibilities.
   3.4.1. JEP Exercises.
       3.4.1.1. AF/A3O-ATT is the AF OPR for managing CE2-supplied SIF.
       3.4.1.1. (AFGSC) AFGSC/A3X will manage all CE2-supplied Service Incremental
       Funding (SIF) for units. Unit requirements will be identified during the Annual
       Scheduling Conference and Quarterly Update Conferences and validated by the AFGSC
       EWG. Updates on unit expenditures may be requested by AFGSC/A3X at any point
       during the year.
       3.4.1.2. JS/J-7 (JEXD) is the OPR for managing CE2-supplied PH, IT, and CTP funds.
       AF/A3O-ATT will coordinate consolidated AF requests for these funds to JS by exercise.
       3.4.1.3. All AF organizations will comply with JCS exercise funding guidance in AFI
       65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Table 10.3.
   3.4.2. Non-JEP Exercises. Air Force organizations conducting unilateral or other joint
   exercises not within the approved JEP must fund these exercises from their own O&M
   accounts. For Air Force-sponsored non-JEP exercises, the MAJCOM or Air Force
   organization sponsoring an exercise is generally responsible for funding the exercise.
   3.4.2. (AFGSC) AFGSC unit participation in non-JEP exercises will be documented in the
   CPS. MAJCOM or service funding will be coordinated through AFGSC/A3X.
   3.4.3. Combined Exercises. Combined exercises should have a written arrangement with
   the foreign participant(s) that includes the authority for the exercise, the scope of the
 34                                                AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013


   exercise, status of US personnel (paragraph 1.3.4.6), and funding procedures, as
   appropriate. Any US training provided to participating countries should be handled under
   available legal authority, such as by a foreign military sales (FMS) case or cross-servicing
   agreement under Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) authority.
3.5. HAF Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Process for Service
Incremental Funding (SIF).
   3.5.1. During the Program Objective Memorandum (POM) development process,
   MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs will submit their Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) SIF
   requirements for JEP exercises to AF/A3O-ATT.
      3.5.1.1. AF/A3O-ATT will consolidate Air Force requirements and submit the Air Force
      SIF request to OUSD(P&R).
      3.5.1.1. (AFGSC) AFGSC/A3X will consolidate AFGSC SIF funding requirements and
      submit them to AF/A3O-AI in accordance with paragraph 3.4.1.1
      3.5.1.2. OUSD(P&R) incorporates AF SIF requirements into the overall Defense-wide
      CE2 request as part of the President’s Budget (PB).
   3.5.2. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act establishes the amount of CE2 funds
   appropriated for the upcoming execution year. Congress must approve and the President
   must sign this act for funds to be available. If the appropriations act is not signed before the
   beginning of the execution year, funding is generally available under a continuing resolution.
   3.5.3. OUSD(P&R) will determine AF SIF funding for the current execution year and
   publish this information as part of the CE2 Program Execution Plan (PEP). Once the AF SIF
   allocation is known, AF/A3O-ATT will provide execution year fiscal guidance to AF
   MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs.
      3.5.3.1. If a MAJCOM/FOA/DRU encounters an unanticipated SIF requirement during
      the current fiscal year, the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU should notify AF/A3O-ATT of the
      requirement. The notification should include sufficient explanation to justify a request
      for additional funds. If AF/A3O-ATT cannot fund the requirement from existing AF SIF
      resources, when deemed appropriate, they will submit an Unfunded Requirement to the
      Joint Staff for additional funds from the CE2 Program.
      3.5.3.1. (AFGSC) Units will immediately notify AFGSC/A3X of evolving CAF or JCS
      exercise funding requirements. AFGSC/A3X will serve as the interface with AF/A3O-AI
      to resolve funding requirements.
      3.5.3.2. AF SIF must only be obligated to fund valid JEP exercise activities.
      MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs should notify AF/A3O-ATT when they have excess SIF funds.
      Ultimately, SIF funds not needed to support AF exercise participation requirements revert
      back to OUSD(P&R) control for reallocation against other CE2 program requirements.
3.6. Tracking and Reporting.
   3.6.1. PH/IT and CTP funds are distributed per the procedures in paragraphs 3.3.1 and
   3.3.2 respectively. SIF funds are distributed per AF/A3O-ATT-issued fiscal guidance.

   funds sub-allocated from the Joint Staff. Flash Reports will be submitted to the Joint Staff
   Comptroller with info to AF/A3O-ATT by the third working day of the following month.
3.7. Funding for Aerial Refueling of Foreign Aircraft during Combined Exercises.
   3.7.1. USAF tankers flying aerial refueling missions to exclusively support US aircraft
   during combined exercises can also refuel foreign aircraft on the same mission provided the
   following conditions are met:
      3.7.1.1. Refueling of foreign aircraft is conducted on a strictly opportune, non-
      interference basis.
      3.7.1.2. Exercise tanker missions are scheduled based on supporting US exercise mission
      requirements only.
      3.7.1.3. Tanker loiter time is not added to exercise tanker missions simply to
      accommodate non-exercise refueling operations.
      3.7.1.4. Foreign governments must pay for the fuel offloaded in accordance with USAF
      instructions and procedures (for example, pursuant to the terms of a reciprocal fuels
      agreement, cross-servicing agreement, or FMS case).
   3.7.2. If the foreign aircraft refueling operation does not increase the required flying time of
   the planned exercise-only refueling mission, the foreign government must only pay for the
   offloaded fuel.
      3.7.2.1. If the foreign aircraft refueling takes place outside the “envelope” for meeting
      USAF mission requirements and time is added to the planned exercise refueling mission
      to support foreign aircraft refueling operations, the foreign government must also pay for
      the additional flying hours along with the offloaded fuel.
   3.7.3. When a combined exercise utilizes USAF tankers to refuel foreign aircraft as part of
   the exercise, the refueling of foreign aircraft can be conducted on a less than full cost
   reimbursement basis provided that:
      3.7.3.1. The purpose of the combined exercise is to employ coalition force concepts of
      operations that require USAF aerial refueling of foreign aircraft in support of DoD
      mission requirements;
36                                                AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013


     3.7.3.2. The primary MAJCOM/A3 supporting the exercise approves of conducting the
     refueling on a less than full cost reimbursement basis;
     3.7.3.3. The primary MAJCOM/A3 supporting the exercise notifies AF/A3O-AT and
     AMC/FMF with a command coordinated memorandum specifying the aerial refueling
     operations that will be conducted on a less than full cost reimbursement basis. The
     memorandum should be submitted NLT 30 days prior to the exercise and include:
         3.7.3.3.1. A description of the operation, including objectives;
         3.7.3.3.2. The US mission requirements to be satisfied;
         3.7.3.3.3. A list of expenses to be assumed by the DoD and the funding source;
         3.7.3.3.4. A list of expenses to be assumed by the foreign government, including
         method of payment to DoD for required reimbursements.
  3.7.4. If the foreign aircraft aerial refueling does not meet the criteria set forth in
  paragraphs 3.7.1 or 3.7.3., aerial refueling must be conducted on a full reimbursement basis.
  The foreign government must pay for all applicable costs, such as offloaded fuel,
  boom/drogue time, tanker transit time, and loiter time.
  3.7.5. Foreign Aerial Refueling Requirements.
     3.7.5.1. Foreign receiver pilots and commercial and foreign tanker crews participating in
     aerial refueling operations during exercise missions involving USAF tankers or receivers
     must be qualified in and use USAF aerial refueling terminology and procedures as
     specified in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Allied Tactical Publication
     (ATP)-56(B),                 Air              to              Air             Refuelling
     (http://www.raf.mod.uk/downloads/airtoair56b.cfm).
         3.7.5.1.1. Per ATP-56(B), qualified foreign pilots and commercial and foreign boom
         operators must meet aerial refueling currency requirements or adhere to published re-
         currency procedures.
         3.7.5.1.2. Exercise aerial refueling missions will not be used to qualify or requalify
         foreign receiver pilots, or commercial or foreign boom operators as this is the
         provision of a defense service to the foreign country that requires a FMS case or
         cross-servicing agreement under ACSA authority, as appropriate (see DoDD
         5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM), Chapter 10.5).
     3.7.5.2. Tanker and receiver aircraft operated commercially or by foreign nations must
     be certified as technically compatible for aerial refueling operations with USAF receiver
     and tanker aircraft. Information about foreign receiver aircraft that are technically
     compatible with USAF tankers, commercial and foreign tankers that are technically
     compatible with USAF receivers, and instructions for requesting a technical compatibility
     assessment are published in ATP-56(B), Annex Z, US National Annex.

          AIR FORCE JOINT EXERCISE COORDINATION TEAM (AFJECT)

A2.1. Overview. This attachment outlines the organization, responsibilities and procedures for
the AFJECT and describes the process for developing the Global Exercise Schedule (GES).
ACC/A3J Division Chief is the AFJECT Chairperson and delegated authority to coordinate
USAF support for joint and USAF service-level training events to include Flag exercises, Joint
National Training Center (JNTC) events and functional command events.
A2.2. Objective. The objective of the AFJECT is to coordinate, schedule, and deconflict, as
required, the Air Force Air & Space Operations Center (AOC), Control and Reporting Center
(CRC), Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), 505th Command and Control Wing (505 CCW),
assets assigned by the EIPT and any other MAJCOM units/assets used to support USAF,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), COCOM-sponsored and other MAJCOM
exercises and experiments. The AFJECT uses the GES to accomplish this task.
A2.3. Organization.
   A2.3.1. The AFJECT is an action officer (AO) level working group made up of exercise
   planners, schedulers and support staff from the member organizations listed in Para 3.3. and
   chaired by the ACC/A3J Division Chief. The Chairman is the spokesperson for the AFJECT
   and approves all team decisions.
   A2.3.2. The AFJECT will submit a coordinated and validated GES to the Exercise
   Integrated Process Team (EIPT) and Exercise General Officer Steering Group (EGOSG), in
   turn, for approval. This approval chain will also be used to address unresolved exercise
   support issues that occur during the GES development process. If required, MAJCOM
   representatives can also engage the EIPT or EGOSG to reclama exercise scheduling conflicts
   or other AFJECT decisions. In all cases, issues will be resolved at the lowest appropriate
   level.
   A2.3.3. Membership. As a minimum, the following organizations will have representatives
   on the AFJECT:
       A2.3.3.1. ACC
       A2.3.3.2. PACAF (AFPAC)
       A2.3.3.3. USAFE (AFEUR)

   The first conference, normally held in the Spring, will prioritize and deconflict, as required,
   the next year’s exercise and experiment schedules. It is normally scheduled NLT 90 days
   after the Spring Joint Staff (JS) Worldwide Joint Training and Scheduling Conference
   (WJTSC). The second conference, normally held in the Fall, will address the exercise
   schedule for the ensuing 18-24 months, provide exercise related updates and address any
   emerging issues. This second conference will typically use video teleconference (VTC)
   capabilities to minimize travel requirements and encourage maximum participation.
   A2.4.2. Global Exercise Schedule (GES) Preparation.
      A2.4.2.1. The GES is developed in one-year increments. The AFJECT program
      manager will develop five years of exercise schedules and maintain them on the AFJECT
      Community of Practice (CoP) website.
      A2.4.2.2. MAJCOM program and functional managers will identify/establish their
      command exercise requirements and submit them to the AFJECT program manager NLT
      2 months prior to each biannual AFJECT conference for posting onto the CoP. Exercise
      planners will work with the AFJECT program manager to determine resource availability
      and coordinate specific support requirements.
      A2.4.2.3. Six weeks prior to each conference, AFJECT members will review the GES
      and identify the exercises their units are participating in and annotate the exercise support
      resources they are requesting for their events (i.e. exercise control group, AOC manning
      augmentation, etc.). Any changes to GES information must be submitted to the program
      manager NLT two weeks before the conference.
      A2.4.2.4. In preparation for the AFJECT conference, the AFJECT program manager will
      post all scheduling changes, build a draft schedule and develop the AFJECT briefing.
      Functional program managers will review the updated schedule to determine unit
      supportability. MAJCOM planners/schedulers should attempt to resolve exercise

       scheduling issues prior to the conference. Unresolved issues will be addressed during the
       conference.
          A2.4.2.4.1. Voluntary support to non-AFJECT scheduled events does not relieve a
          unit of the responsibility to support AFJECT scheduled requirements. Also, while the
          AFJECT does not schedule AFRC/ANG forces, AFRC and ANG units should utilize
          the GES to identify training and support opportunities.
       A2.4.2.5. Following the AFJECT conference, the program manager will draft the
       meeting minutes, update the GES, as required, and forward it to the EIPT and EGOSG, in
       turn, for approval. Once the GES is approved, the program manager will prepare the 505
       CCW tasking message for ACC/CV release.

                               GLOBAL POWER TRAINING

A5.1. (AFGSC) Purpose. The Global Power Training concept is to “train like we fight.” It is
rooted in the belief that “the US Air Force provides the Nation a unique capability to project
national influence anywhere in the world on very short notice. Air and space forces, through
their inherent speed, range, and flexibility, can respond to national requirements by delivering
precise military power to create effects where and when needed” (AFDD 1).
A5.2. (AFGSC) Objective. The objective of Global Power Training sorties (also known as
Global Power sorties) is to increase unit combat capability by providing robust and realistic
training opportunities in the global arena, involving multiple Areas of Responsibility (AOR).
There is also the potential for these sorties to have much broader shaping or deterrent effects by
demonstrating to our allies and adversaries, long-range aviation operations, activities, and
capabilities. The Global Power Training program by itself is unclassified, although the exercise
it is connected with may be classified.
A5.3. (AFGSC) Command Relationships. The execution order (EXORD) for Global Power
Training missions will specify the command relationships. For most training missions
Operational Control (OPCON) should remain with CDRUSSTRATCOM. The supported
commander has Tactical Control (TACON) for exercise purposes whenever forces not assigned
to that combatant commander (CCDR) take part in an exercise in the CCDR’s AOR. TACON
begins when the aircraft enters the AOR, and is terminated at the completion of the exercise or
after departing the AOR. TACON provides direct authority over exercising forces for purposes
relating to that exercise only; it does not authorize operational employment of those aircraft.
Specified elements of administrative control (ADCON), to include force protection and
concurrent UCMJ authority, are also granted to the supported commander for deployment/diverts
into the AOR.
A5.4. (AFGSC) Global Power Training sortie requirements.
   A5.4.1. (AFGSC) As a minimum, a Global Power Training sortie must depart the
   Continental United States (CONUS) and/or exit the Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ),
   conduct weapons activity (actual or simulated on a case by case approval basis), and exercise
   under the direct control of an Air Operations Center (AOC). Although not required, air
   refueling and entering/exiting another AOR meet the intent of improving long-range combat
   capability and are preferred. Sortie profiles should include a robust target set, a credible
   threat environment and varied mission tasks including a realistic Command and Control
   architecture. Targets, weapons, threats, C2 and tasks will be simulated when the sortie lacks
   actual training opportunities.
   A5.4.2. (AFGSC) Each sortie must be a minimum of 13 hours. A goal is for crews to
   experience the physiological effects of long duration flight and practice the required
   mitigation measures. The length of the Global Power mission will depend upon the actual
   sortie profile and scenario.
   A5.4.3. (AFGSC) Higher Headquarters Directed missions, while deployed, also qualify for
   Global Power credit if they meet the above requirements in A2.3.1 and A2.3.2.
 54                                                AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013


A5.5. (AFGSC) Funding. For specified Global Strike Training sorties AFGSC/A3X will fund
TDY, per diem, and billeting costs of operations and maintenance personnel supporting the
mission. AFGSC/A3X will approve funding for Global Power Training missions on a case-by-
case basis. Global Power Training funding is not authorized for air shows or airlift requests.
A5.6. (AFGSC) Scheduling. AFGSC/A3X will manage the Global Power Training program.
The majority of Global Power Training missions will be scheduled and coordinated at the
AFGSC/A3X working group meetings. Other Global Power Training missions will be
considered on a case-by-case basis. However, all Global Power Training sorties must be
coordinated with AFGSC/A3X. The goal is for AFGSC squadrons to conduct at least one Global
Power Training sortie per quarter.
A5.7. (AFGSC) Public Affairs. Many long duration missions will attract media attention, and
this is encouraged. All public affairs questions should be routed to the Office of Public Affairs,
HQ AFGSC/PA, DSN 781-0819.
A5.8. (AFGSC) Numbered Air Force Responsibilities.
   A5.8.1. (AFGSC) 8AF, through 608 AOC, should work range requests, fighter
   intercepts/escort, tanker/ALTRV, airlift support, diplomatic clearance, airspace coordination,
   Electronic Attack, etc, through the appropriate organization. 608 AOC will provide the
   bomber wing all information, once coordinated.
   A5.8.2. (AFGSC) 8AF, through 608 AOC, will ensure the correct Air Refueling Support
   Priority (IAW CJCSI 4120.02B) is assigned.
A5.9. (AFGSC) Individual Bomber Unit Responsibilities.
   A5.9.1. (AFGSC) Units will develop local guidance and procedures for all aspects of
   Global Power Training missions.
   A5.9.2. (AFGSC) Appoint a primary and alternate project officer to coordinate with 608
   AOC and AFGSC on all Global Power Training matters. Ensure 608 AOC and AFGSC/A3X
   has a current name, phone number, and e-mail address for the POCs.
   A5.9.3. (AFGSC) Maintain ACC/A3X and 608 AOC as “info” addressee on all message/e-
   mail traffic associated with Global Power Training. Similarly, info the concerned OCONUS
   MAJCOM and parent NAF.
   A5.9.4. (AFGSC) Units will consult the ACC Consolidated Planning Schedule (CPS) to
   determine the type of exercise the Global Power Training mission will support (i.e., JCS,
   MAJCOM, etc.) in order to ensure the correct Air Refueling Support Priority can be
   assigned. Contact AFGSC/A3X if there is any question on the priority level to be assigned.
   A5.9.5. (AFGSC) Units should coordinate air refueling requests as soon as practical since
   tanker support is critical to Global Power Training mission success. Submit tanker requests
   with the proper priority level annotated IAW CJCSI 4120.02B.
   A5.9.6. (AFGSC) Units will consult/comply with the DOD Foreign Clearance Guide for
   applicable overseas/international guidance.
   A5.9.7. (AFGSC) Unit Intel Office will provide support to B-2 and B-52 Unit-Level ISR
   IAW AFI 14-105 and applicable 14-(MDS) guidance.
AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013                                                                55


      A5.9.7.1. (AFGSC) Submit threat advisory support requests NLT 10 working days prior
      to launch date to facilitate coordination with the 8AF Intermediate Unit Intelligence
      office.
   A5.9.8. (AFGSC) Units may explore alternate options if the mission cannot be
   accomplished as planned. However, alternate missions should be kept as simple as possible
   due to the complexity of the primary mission. Training events will be limited to the minimum
   required to accomplish the specific mission taskings and operational training.
   A5.9.9. (AFGSC) Provide a detailed summary of planned employment activity to 608
   AOC/CPD and AFGSC/A3X NLT 2 weeks prior to sortie date. Unit POCs will also contact
   608 AOC/CPD 48 hours prior to mission launch to update the two-week report.
   A5.9.10. (AFGSC) In-flight reports must be made to the appropriate AOC IAW AFTTP 3-
   1. These reports will include, as a minimum, a takeoff report, end air refueling report, a strike
   report, and a landing report. Also, a report will be made anytime unplanned circumstances
   significantly affect the outcome of the mission, such as in-flight emergency, divert, release
   system malfunction, weather, navigation problems, etc. The aircrew should request relay of
   the report to the 608 AOC (DSN 781-0859/0710). 608 AOC will relay the report to AFGSC
   Command Center as well as the parent wing command post.
   A5.9.11. (AFGSC) Within 3 days after the mission, a call must be made to the 608
   AOC/CPD and AFGSC/A3X with a verbal report on the mission. This is not an official after-
   action report but a generalized “how it went” briefing. EXCEPTION: if anything occurs
   during the mission that needs to be briefed to the AFGSC or NAF Staff (diversion,
   emergency, diplomatic incident, etc.), call the AFGSC Command Center, DSN 781-9788,
   immediately.
A5.10. (AFGSC) Flight Duty Limitations.
   A5.10.1. (AFGSC) Maximum Flight Duty Period. Maximum flight duty period for all
   sorties is defined in AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, Table 9.1. and AFI11-
   202V3_AFGSCSUP For all Global Power Training sorties exceeding maximum flight duty
   periods units must request a duty day waiver from AFGSC/A3. For HHD Global Power
   Training missions, the approved EXORD should contain a statement approving the waiver
   request as well as identifying the maximum duty day for the sortie.
   A5.10.2. (AFGSC) Units are encouraged to use any reasonable means to shorten an
   extended crew duty day, such as preflight crews or minimized show times, but also balance
   the need to treat the sortie as much like an actual combat sortie as possible. Every attempt
   should be made to minimize conflict with crew circadian rhythms. Where possible, avoid
   scheduling critical phases of flight during normal sleep periods (such as 2300 through 0600
   hours home-base time).
   A5.10.3. (AFGSC) Crew Chief Work and Rest Plan. The aircraft commander, in
   conjunction with the en route station chief of maintenance, will determine how long the crew
   chief can safely perform aircraft recovery actions. The crew chief must have the opportunity
   for 8 hours sleep in each 24-hour period. See AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment
   Maintenance Management, for detailed guidance.
A5.11. (AFGSC) Human Factors/Physiological Issues.
 56                                               AFI10-204_AFGSCSUP_I 6 MARCH 2013


   A5.11.1. (AFGSC) It is highly recommended that units contact their Wing’s Aerospace and
   Physiology Training team for missions exceeding 24 hours. The Aerospace and Physiology
   Training team can provide a mission fatigue management timeline. The timeline will provide
   information on sleep/wake cycles and light (night/day) levels expected for route of flight.
   Requirements for the timeline are latitudes and longitudes of route of flight, T/O and land
   times, AR times, and low altitude times.
   A5.11.2. (AFGSC) Unit flight surgeons will ensure medications (Go and No-Go Pills) are
   used IAW current AF/A3 and AFGSC/SG guidelines.
   A5.11.3. (AFGSC) Unit flight surgeons will also ensure aircrews receive briefings on
   human performance and physiological issues related to long duration missions.
   A5.11.4. (AFGSC) The wing life support officer will develop a long duration flight
   equipment package (i.e., noise reduction headsets, piddle packs, mattress, sleeping bag, etc.)
   as appropriate for the sortie. Use of long duration flight equipment, to include quick-don
   oxygen masks, is restricted to periods of high altitude cruise flight. Comply with ejection
   seat requirements for high altitude cruise removal of parachute/torso harness in AFI 11-
   202V3.
   A5.11.5. (AFGSC) Unit planners will contact unit flight surgeons upon initiation of
   planning. Factors to be considered include pre- and post-flight crew rest, use of medication,
   required human factors briefings and scheduling of in-flight activities. The unit flight
   surgeon will act as liaison with Air Force Research Laboratory and request on scene
   assistance as needed. The mission fatigue timeline and other related aircrew fatigue
   management documents may function as source documents for guidance.
A5.12. (AFGSC) Theater Instructions.
   A5.12.1. (AFGSC) Barring additional guidance (EXORD, SPINs, etc.) Bomb Wings will
   contact 608/CPD 30 days prior to execution to coordinate entry/exit in specified AORs.
   These procedures do not replace any required exercise-specific reporting instructions or
   absolve planners and crew from detailed mission planning IAW AFI11-202V3 and AFI11-
   2MDSV3, B-2/B-52 Operations Procedures. The delegated authority for requesting an
   aircraft diplomatic clearance will determine diplomatic clearance requirements by reviewing
   the DoD Foreign Clearance Guide for each country’s airspace entered along the route of
   flight. Initial coordination of EXORD creation should begin one month out from planned
   mission execution.
