SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This revision updates the entire Policy Directive expanding information on the Air Force
approach to information management, as well as including information on Air Force information
access programs such as Privacy, Records Management and FOIA.
1. Overview. This policy directive establishes Air Force policy for the management of
information assets (all forms of data and content), across all AF information sources, as both a
strategic resource and corporate asset supporting the warfighter during mission and support
operations.
     1.1. Enable “information aggregation” to promote the development, implementation,
     management, and control needed to make “information decisions” visible to any interested
     and authorized party, and to efficiently include and resolve the needs of all stakeholders, so
     these decisions are made for the benefit of the entire AF enterprise, Joint, Coalition, or inter-
     agency partners.
     1.2. Provide policy to achieve and maintain decision superiority to include, but not limited
     to, information access programs such as Records Management and the Privacy Act Program.
2. Policy. It is AF policy to:

        reconstruction, disaster relief, and humanitarian and civic assistance operations in accord
