This instruction establishes policies, procedures and criteria for appointment and Federal recognition of
officers below the grade of general in the Air National Guard (ANG) of the United States and as Reserves
of the Air Force (AF). It implements appropriate provisions of 10 United States Code (USC) and 32 USC
and is to be used in conjunction with AFI 36-2005, Appointment in Commissioned Grades and Designa-
tion and Assignment in Professional Categories -- Reserve of the Air Force and United States Air Force.
Copies of state supplements to this instruction will be provided to ANG, Directorate of Diversity, Person-
nel and Training (ANG/DP).

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This publication incorporates significant changes to the ANG officer appointment process. Table 3.1.,
Grade Determination which lowers the service credit requirement for grade entry has been added. This
revision removes the temporary appointment provision. Waiver requirements have been listed in Chapter
11 and a list of Uniform Guide List for Typical Offenses has been added at Attachment 7. Attachment 2,
Statement of Agreement and Understanding Required for Air National Guard of the United States
(ANGUS) Appointment, has been revised. Forms, Information Management Tools (IMTs), and docu-
ments for ANG appointment, Attachment 5, have been completely revised and list all required docu-
ments by competitive category. Attachment 8 is a new form memo, State Air Surgeon Verification of
Credentials, for use with health care provider appointment/applications. Attachment 9 lists the condi-
tions, which allow waivers of deferred officers.

                                     APPOINTMENT POLICIES

2.1. Selection of Officers. The selection of officers for appointment in the ANG is a function of the state.
Appointments are made without regard to race, color, creed, national origin, sex, or age, except where
specifically authorized by this instruction or AFI 36-2005. By authority of the Secretary of the Air Force
(SAF), appointments are federally recognized in the ANGUS at the discretion of the Chief, NGB.

2.2. Federal Recognition. A reserve officer of any uniformed service (except Public Health Service)
will not be federally recognized in a grade other than the permanent grade currently held, unless the
officer is being considered for reappointment to or from a different competitive category.

2.3. Appointment in Commissioned Grade. The Secretary of Defense will make initial appointment in
the commissioned grade of lieutenant colonel. Appointment in the ANG in commissioned grades above
lieutenant colonel must be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Applicants who qual-
ify for initial appointment in these grades may be appointed in the grade of major pending Secretary of
Defense/Senate confirmation of their nomination for a higher grade. Individuals so appointed must sign a
statement of understanding concerning their appointment in the grade of major. Federal Recognition
Examining Boards will be convened in accordance with NGR (AF) 36-3, for appointment in the ANG.

2.4. Appointment as Reserve of the Air Force. Appointment as a Reserve of the Air Force is for an
indefinite period. The tenure and acceptance of an appointment as a Reserve of the Air Force is necessary
for federal recognition in the ANGUS.

2.5. Requirements and Qualifications. The requirements and qualifications prescribed in this instruc-
tion are the minimum for appointment. Persons selected for appointment and federal recognition must be
qualified IAW AFMAN 36-2105, Officer Classification, and AFI 36-2005. Appointment is not assured
merely by meeting the established minimum requirements.

2.6. Effective Date. The effective date of Federal recognition will be the date that an individual is
appointed in the ANG and executes the Oath of Office (NGB 337, Oaths of Office), or, the date of the Fed-
eral Recognition Examining Board (NGB 89-1, Proceedings of a Federal Recognition Examining Board),
whichever is later.

2.7. Non-Prior Service Applicants. All non-prior service applicants seeking an initial line officer
appointment must be enlisted prior to initiating an appointment package. Non-prior service applicants will
be enlisted in the grade of Airman First Class (E-3). Prior to attending the Academy of Military Science
the applicant will be promoted to the grade of Staff Sergeant (E-5). A request for a security clearance must
be initiated immediately. Enlistment waivers submitted for the purpose of appointment must specifically
include a request for waivers of both enlistment and appointment criteria. A copy of waivers approved by
ANG/DP for enlistment must be forwarded with the appointment application to ANG/DP. Waivers
approved solely for enlistment will not necessarily be accepted for appointment processing.
ANGI36-2005 15 MARCH 2005                                                                                9


2.8. Testing. Applicants enlisted for the sole purpose of appointment are not required to take the Armed
Service Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) as long as a qualifying Air Force Officer Qualifying Test
(AFOQT) has been administered and qualifying scores received.

2.9. IMTs/Forms/Documents. Forms, IMTs, and documents listed in Attachment 5, completed for
enlistment can be submitted with an appointment application if they have been completed and signed
within the last 12 months.

2.10. Non-Prior-Service Officers. All non-prior-service officers incur an eight-year Military Service
Obligation (MSO).

2.11. Officer Service Commitment. All officers incur a service commitment IAW ANGI 36-2101,
Assignments within the Air National Guard.

2.12. Professional Officer. A professional category officer appointed under the authority of AFI
36-2005, is not required to complete 84 days Initial Active Duty Training (IADT) in order to perform
active duty. Completion of the Air Force Commissioned Officer Training (COT) course or waiver of such
course is considered “equivalent” IADT.

2.13. Medical Officers. ANG physicians, nurses, and dental officers will be awarded a primary Air
Force Specialty Code (AFSC) in the specialty or sub-specialty they are most qualified. This qualification
will be based on training, experience, license, and standards set forth in AFMAN 36-2105 and AFI
36-2005.

2.14. Assignment of Officers. All officers appointed under the provisions of this instruction must be
assigned to a Unit Manning Document Guard (UMDG) (formerly known as Unit Manning Document)
position IAW ANGI 36-2101.

2.15. Persons Ineligible for Appointment or Federal Recognition. AFI 36-2005, Table 2.2., lists con-
ditions that make applicants ineligible for appointment or Federal recognition.
   2.15.1. Requests for waiver, where specifically authorized in this instruction or AFI 36-2005, will be
   submitted IAW Chapter 11 of this instruction.

2.16. Disqualifying Medical Conditions. AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, describes
disqualifying medical conditions.

2.17. Applicants with Dependents. Service in the ANG and the AF entails potential sacrifice in the
form of frequent training periods, duty away from family members in the event of mobilization, the
demands of shift work, and 24-hour availability to accomplish the mission. For applicant’s prior service
(PS) or Non-prior service (NPS) use Table 2.1., to determine eligibility. Prior service personnel transfer-
ring from another service component, and no break in service, require no waiver. For the purpose of this
instruction, a dependent is:

                       UNIFORM GUIDE LIST FOR TYPICAL OFFENSES

A7.1. Moral Offenses. The following tables contain a listing of offenses differentiated by degrees of
seriousness and divided into categories. ANG/DPF is the final approval/disapproval authority for moral
offenses. However, disapproval may be at any level between the unit commander and TAG. Officers are
expected to be leaders who consistently demonstrate good judgment and set a favorable example for oth-
ers through their appearance, job performance, professionalism, and personal conduct. Applicants whose
personal history includes moral offenses merit careful and deliberate consideration by decision-makers.
Clearly, the overall quality of the applicant and the best interests of the Air National Guard must be over-
riding factors when considering whether submission or approval of a moral offense waiver request is
appropriate. When a waiver is required, the applicant must provide a statement of circumstances sur-
rounding the offense, the wing/group commander must request a waiver with justification for selection of
the applicant, and the state headquarters must indorse the waiver request to submit with the appointment
application.

A7.2. Category 1 Moral Offenses. This list of offenses is a guide. Consider violations of a similar
nature of seriousness as a Category 1 offense. A conviction or adverse adjudication of one or more of
these offenses is disqualifying for entry into the Air Force.

        with intent to commit a felony (adjudicated as adult only).

        Carnal knowledge of a child under 16.

nature or seriousness as a Category 2 offense. In doubtful cases, treat the offense as a Category 2 offense
when the maximum possible confinement under local law exceeds one year. Conviction or adverse adju-
dication of one or more of these offenses is disqualifying for entry into the Air Force.
