1. Scope.
     1.1. Up to 600 people die every day in the United States from sudden cardiac arrest. Most
     cardiac arrests are a result of irregular heart rhythms called ventricular tachycardia or
     ventricular fibrillation. These lethal heart rhythms cause the pumping action of the heart to
     stop abruptly and can rapidly lead to death. The technique of delivering an electrical shock,
     called defibrillation, is the best-known treatment for ventricular fibrillation and pulseless
     ventricular tachycardia. To be effective, defibrillation must be administered within minutes
     of a cardiac arrest. For every minute, that passes without defibrillation and effective
     cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), a victim’s chance of survival decreases seven to 10
     percent. After as little as 10 minutes, very few resuscitation attempts are successful. In the
     past, the ability to defibrillate was solely in the hands of trained emergency medical
     personnel, whom may have a long response time. With the advent of AEDs, a trained
SCOTTAFBI41-101 13 AUGUST 2013                                                                   3


   rescuer can quickly and easily defibrillate a cardiac arrest victim and potentially save a life.
   New generation AEDs are safe, effective, lightweight, low maintenance, and relatively
   inexpensive. Evidence suggests strategic placement of AEDs increases the chance of
   survival during sudden cardiac arrest. Public access refers to the accessibility of the AED
   device itself. Public access does not mean that any member of the public who witnesses a
   person in cardiac arrest should use an AED. Public access to AEDs provides American Heart
   Association (AHA) Heartsaver trained individuals the capability to respond prior to the
   arrival of emergency medical personnel. The scope of AED training and utilization is
   applicable to all civilian federal employees and active duty personnel. The federal Cardiac
   Arrest Survival Act (CASA) was enacted in 2000 with provisions to encourage AED use in
   federal buildings and create immunity for qualified individuals who use AEDs. CASA
   provides conditional immunity from legal liability for harm resulting from use or attempted
   use of an AED by lay responders.
   1.2. AEDs located on medical units or used by medically trained individuals (375th Medical
   Group, 375th Civil Engineer Squadron Fire Department (375 CES/CEF) are not included in
   the PAD Program because these units are not available for public access. AEDs positioned
   on aircraft based out of Scott AFB are not included in the PAD Program.

        2.7.1. Will be trained in CPR/Heartsaver AED.
            2.7.1.1. Is required to re-certify their CPR status prior to the certification expiration
            date. The Scott AFB PAD Program recommends the AHA Heartsaver AED through
            MTN; however, other nationally recognized AED/CPR certifications may be
            accepted.
        2.7.2. Immediately notifies the site coordinator of an emergency event requiring use of
        an AED.
3. AED Acquisition.
     3.1. The model of AED is determined by the medical director with consideration based on
     simplicity of use, durability, battery life, internal memory, warranty, cost, and available
     training packages. For standardization, only one model should be used throughout the
     installation.
        3.1.1. New/replacement type AED acquisitions will be coordinated and approved by the
        medical director, medical logistics and PC (Attachment 8).
     3.2. Medical logistics will approve purchase of AEDs with an approval letter from the
     medical director.
     3.3. Funding of AEDs is a unit responsibility and must be coordinated with medical
     logistics. (Attachment 8). The PAD Program is not a medical program. It is a wing/unit
     program.
     3.4. To ensure system-wide visibility, all AEDs must be loaded into the DMLSS System
     under the responsibility center/cost center (RC/CC) of the section or organization.
     3.5. Medical logistics will order AEDs and accessories utilizing a unit funded DMLSS sub-
     account.
4. AED Placement.
     4.1. The essential key to surviving a heart attack is early access, early CPR, and early
     defibrillation, when indicated. AEDs should be strategically placed throughout the
     unit/facility to reduce time between victim collapse and the ability to provide initial
     defibrillation, if indicated. Factors to consider in determining AED placement include the
     following:
        4.1.1. Facility size and/or accessibility.
        4.1.2. Number of employees in the facility.
        4.1.3. Identified high-risk environments (i.e., high voltage electrical equipment).
        4.1.4. Number of people that may have public access to the facility on a daily basis.
        4.1.5. Average age of the facility occupants; older populations are at higher risk.
        4.1.6. Security levels that may hinder access to the facility by emergency medical
        personnel.
        4.1.7. Optimal response time from identification of a downed person to the arrival of the
        AED is ideally within 3-5 minutes.
SCOTTAFBI41-101 13 AUGUST 2013                                                               7


   4.2. AED accessory kits should be packed with the AED so that the responder will not lose
   time deciding what to take to the emergency. These kits should provide at a minimum items
   such as gloves, scissors, razor, tape, extra electrodes (AED pads), and a barrier mask. A
   copy of the “AED Chain of Survival” treatment algorithm (Attachment 4) will be placed in
   the accessory kit for reference.
   4.3. AEDs should be easily accessible in a well-marked and publicized location. Optimally,
   signs should be placed above or around each AED that can be easily viewed from two
   separate directions (both direct view and “down the hall” -90 degrees to the direct view). A
   telephone, a reliable process, a system to activate EMS, or 911 should also be nearby.
   Storage in an alarmed AED housing unit or secure location that minimizes potential
   tampering, theft, damage or inadvertent harm is highly recommended.
5. AED Inspection and Maintenance.
   5.1. The Medical Equipment Repair Center (MERC) (375 MDSS/SGSME, commercial
   (618) 256-7455/DSN 576-7455) will serve as the point of contact (POC) for site coordinators
   and manufacturer representatives concerning problems with AEDs.
      5.1.1. The MERC will coordinate annual maintenance inspection issues with the PC and
      site coordinators.
   5.2. The MERC will maintain a list of all organizations housing AEDs and their physical
   locations.
      5.2.1. AED locations are not to be changed without prior coordination with the PC and
      MERC to ensure visibility, accountability, and to guarantee maintenance/recall functions
      occur in a timely manner.
   5.3. The MERC will be responsible for any inspection or maintenance beyond the operator’s
   capability/responsibility. MERC inspection/maintenance actions will be accomplished IAW
   manufacturer’s specifications and documented/tracked in the DMLSS electronic database
   IAW AFI 41-201, Managing Clinical Engineering Programs. The MERC will bill the unit’s
   accounting classification code for services rendered.
      5.3.1. Funding of non-repairable devices or expired components/accessories is a unit
      responsibility and must be coordinated with MERC/medical logistics.
      5.3.2. User inspections will be conducted and documented monthly in accordance with
      PAD Program guidance, manufacturer’s manual and AED Inspection Checklist
      (Attachment 10).
6. Quality Assurance.
   6.1. The medical director or designee will review all event summary sheets to assess quality
   of care.
   6.2. The medical director will provide post event feedback to the unit commander, site
   coordinator and those involved with the emergency event.
7. Documentation.
   7.1. All appointment letters (Attachment 3) are to be renewed annually or when changes
   dictate.

       7.1.1. The PC and site coordinators maintain copies of all appointment letters for
       continuity.
    7.2. An event summary (Attachment 2) will be completed by the targeted responders and
    site coordinator and forwarded to the PC within 2 working days.
    7.3. Staff Assistance Visits (Attachment 6) Annual staff assistance visits will be performed
    to provide an opportunity to inspect and evaluate compliance with state and federal
    guidelines. Policies and procedures will be updated at this time.
    7.4. AED Inspection Checklist (Attachment 10) documents are utilized by site coordinators
    to record monthly inspections of AEDs.
       7.4.1. Discrepancies noted are to be remedied immediately by the site coordinators.
       7.4.2. If coordination with MERC is required, the PC will be contacted for assistance.

                TRAUMATIC STRESS RESPONSE (TSR) INFORMATION

A7.1. What is TSR Stress Management? It is a comprehensive system of crisis intervention
designed to assist individuals and groups affected by traumatic events (natural disasters, terrorist
events, and suicides, death - either accidental or intentional). Previously, this intervention was
known as critical incident stress management (CISM).
A7.2. What events might precipitate a request for TSR services? Many types of events have
the potential to produce individual and community traumatic stress. Events include large-scale
disasters (tornadoes, bombings, hurricanes, etc.) and small-scale disasters (suicide, death or near-
death of coworker, workplace violence event, etc.). TSR services will be provided after
traumatic events to help those who have experienced the events. The goal is to assist those
affected by traumatic events to cope with the normal stress reaction in an effective manner.
These actions are intended to minimize the impact of exposure to these events and prevent or
mitigate permanent disability if possible.
A7.3. What is the procedure for requesting TSR services? The office of record for TSR
services is the Mental Health Clinic (256-7386). Please address any inquiries about TSR
services to the Chief of the TSR team.
