This supplement implements and extends guidance of Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 23-110, V2,
PT2 and AFMAN 23-110, V2, PT2, AFSPC Sup 1. This supplement describes 45 SW
procedures for use in conjunction with the basic AFMAN and AFSPC Supplement. It applies to
all 45 SW activities, tenants, and contractors operated or supported by the USAF Standard Base
Supply System. This supplement does apply to Air Force Reserve Command and Air National
Guard units.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This 45 SW supplement reflects minor changes in AFMAN 23-110, V2, PT2.

CHAPTER 16

SECTION A

16.2.1. Separate reverse-post logs are maintained in Document Control and Inventory to control
reverse-post actions.

16.2.2. The Document Control and the Inventory offices are the only offices authorized to make
reverse-post inputs. There are restrictions imposed upon personnel assigned to these two offices.

16.4.4. The Customer Service office, Zero Overpricing (ZOP) Monitor will not input reverse-
post inputs. The monitor will forward to Document Control for processing.

16.4.4. Note: Only Document Control office and the Inventory office will process reverse-posts.

SECTION B

16.6.6. The Document Control office will monitor all assigned "Q" freezes by establishing a
suspense file of FFC notices and through use of the local "Frozen Records Listing"
(QLP/U02). The Document Control office will research transaction registers necessary to
ascertain the individual or unit responsible for the freeze code assignment, when they haven't
received a request for reverse posting. When the FFC does not identify the responsible unit or
individual, and the Document Control office doesn't have a matching reverse post request, the
freeze code will be deleted. When a freeze code "Q" has been assigned for three workdays, it
will appear on the QLP/U02 until it is cleared. The Document Control office will contact the
responsible unit or individual concerned to find out why it has not been cleared. If after five
workdays the Document Control office doesn't feel that continued retention of the "Q" freeze is
justified, they may delete the freeze.
