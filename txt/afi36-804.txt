Supersedes AFR 40-533, 23 March 1990.                                                            Pages: 10

This instruction implements AFPD 36-8, Employee Benefits and Entitlements. It establishes the require-
ments for the appointment, reappointment, academic rank, award of tenure (if applicable), salary step
adjustment, and merit awards for professional civilian faculty members of the Air War College, Air Com-
mand and Staff College, the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), and the United States Air Force
Academy (USAFA). It assigns responsibilities to Air Force components and provides the policy to be fol-
lowed in implementing and maintaining the program. These programs are authorized by Title 10, United
States Code (U.S.C.), Section 9314 for AFIT and Section 9331 for USAFA. Section 9021 of Public Law
101-189 extended coverage to civilian faculty members of Air University (AU). The Secretary of the Air
Force, as delegated in this instruction, prescribes basic pay rates for civilian faculty members: Level IV of
the Executive Schedule limits those rates. This instruction does not apply to the United States Air Force
Reserve or Title 5, United States Code, employees of the National Guard. The Privacy Act of 1974
affects this instruction.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This instruction adds policy guidance for USAFA civilian faculty members and deletes precedural guid-
ance for AU civilian faculty members and delegates that responsibility to the AU Commander (AU/CC).



1. Scope of Applicability and Authority. Sections 9314 and 9331(c) 10 U.S.C., and section 9021 10
U.S.C., authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to employ as many civilians as faculty members as the
Secretary considers necessary at the AFIT, USAFA, and AU. All the laws, rules, regulations and proce-
dures that apply to General Schedule (GS) and Senior Executive Service (SES) employees also apply to
civilian faculty members hired under this pay plan unless this instruction specifies otherwise. The titles,
duties, and pay of civilian faculty members should be similar to those in other Federal degree-conferring
institutions. Accomplish all personnel actions following equal employment opportunity guidelines;
ensure equal opportunity regardless of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, or handicapping con-
dition. This instruction applies to all civilian faculty members who the AU/CC or the USAFA Superin-
tendent (SUPT) says are covered.

2. Responsibility for Administration:
   2.1. Establishing Faculty Pay Schedules. The Director of Civilian Personnel Policy and Personnel
   Plans (HQ USAF/DPC) with AU and USAFA input reviews the adequacy of the Faculty Pay Sched-
   ules. The Director considers salaries at comparable Federal and non-Federal degree-conferring insti-
   tutions in order to establish pay schedules that are comparable to those of competing institutions. The
   Director makes changes which reflect the annual adjustment to the GS using the methods provided in
   Attachment 1; the changes will be effective on the same date as the GS. See Attachment 2 for a
   sample pay schedule.
       2.1.1. Alternate Schedules. When disparity between the Faculty Pay Plan and pay at non-Fed-
       eral institutions exists, HQ USAF/DPC may establish alternate pay schedules to eliminate com-
       petitive disadvantages. Create alternate schedules by adding additional steps to the basic pay
       schedule.
           2.1.1.1. Effective Date. The alternate schedule effective date is the beginning of the first pay
           period after HQ USAF/DPC approves the schedule. When academic disciplines are added to
           an existing alternate schedule, use the beginning of the first pay period after the discipline is
           approved for inclusion on the schedule as the effective date.
           2.1.1.2. Termination of Alternate Schedules. When you no longer need a covered academic
           discipline, remove the discipline from the schedule and pay newly hired faculty members
           using the Faculty Pay Plan. Current faculty members remain on the alternate schedule until
           their current term of appointment ends.
   2.2. Delegation of Authority to Administer the Faculty Pay Plan. The Director of Civilian Per-
   sonnel Policy and Personnel Plans has delegated the Faculty Pay Plan administration to the AU Com-
   mander and to the USAFA Superintendent. AU/CC and USAFA/SUPT will develop implementing
   instructions. AU/CC and USAFA/SUPT may delegate the authority to administer specific parts of the
   Plan.

3. Duties and Titles of Faculty and Administrators:
   3.1. Civilian Faculty Members. Civilian faculty members hold one of four academic ranks: Instruc-
   tor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, or Professor. AU/CC and the SUPT establish duties for
   civilian faculty members. Civilian faculty members are paid from one of the steps on the appropriate
   Faculty Pay Schedule.
   3.2. Administrative Faculty. AU and USAFA may establish administrative faculty positions.
   Administrative faculty who are selected from the civilian faculty continue holding their previous fac-
   ulty status and may resume their regular faculty duties upon relinquishing their administrative faculty
   duties unless the member is relieved for cause. Administrative faculty are paid from the Administra-
   tive Faculty Pay Schedule.
   3.3. Senior Managers. AU and USAFA may establish senior manager positions. The laws, rules,
   and regulations applicable to the SES also apply to senior managers. Senior managers are paid from
   the Senior Manager Pay Schedule.
                                                 2
   3.4. Other Academic Positions. AU and USAFA may establish other related academic positions
   such as visiting faculty, adjunct faculty, or physical education instructors. The appropriate institution
   assignes duties and responsibilities and pays employees one of the approved pay schedules.

4. Appointments. Select civilian faculty members using a competitive process. The initial appointment
will not normally exceed 3 years. Promotions to higher academic rank does not affect the length of the
term of the current appointment. Newly appointed employees are subject to a 1-year trial period at the
discretion of the Commander AU or the SUPT USAFA. The SUPT or AU/CC may approve exceptions
to the competitive process when the exceptions are in the best interest of the Air Force. Limit such
appointments to 1 year or less.

5. Promotions. The AU and the USAFA establish a merit based promotion policy that includes achieve-
ments in teaching, research, and service to the institution.

6. Academic Rank. The AU/CC and the SUPT establish minimum performance, education, and experi-
ence criteria for assignment or promotion to Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Profes-
sor, Administrative Faculty, and Senior Manager positions. These criteria must be consistent with those
in comparable Federal and non-Federal degree-conferring institutions. The SUPT specifies academic
rank criteria for physical education instructors at USAFA.

7. Pay Setting:
   7.1. Initial Appointment. Determine starting salary based on an individual’s experience, academic
   rank, and academic discipline.
   7.2. Merit Pay Adjustments. Base pay adjustments upon the faculty member’s accomplishments.
   An individual may receive step increases and awards concurrently.
   7.3. Promotion in Academic Rank. A civilian faculty member will normally receive an increase of
   two salary steps when he or she is promoted from one academic rank to another.

8. Academic Tenure. The AU/CC may establish procedures to grant academic tenure. While tenure is
not normally granted at the time of initial appointment, you may make exceptions when the individual
concerned has exceptional qualifications. The USAFA may not grant academic tenure.

9. Duty Periods. The civilian faculty duty period is normally 12 months and will not be less than 10
months. A 10-month duty period at 10/12 of the 12-month salary or an 11-month duty period at 11/12 of
the 12-month salary may be approved by AU/CC or the SUPT.

10. Nonreappointment or Removal:
   10.1. Nonreappointment. AU/CC and the SUPT determine whether to renew the appointment of a
   civilian faculty member without academic tenure at their respective institutions. If you do not renew
   an appointment, the affected faculty member will be notified in writing following the procedures
   developed by AU/CC and the SUPT.
   10.2. Advance Notice. A civilian faculty member should give at least 6 months’ notice of intention to
   resign or retire.


                                                3
   10.3. Removal. Separate a civilian faculty member for cause in accordance with procedures con-
   tained in AFI 36-704, Discipline and Adverse Actions (PA) (formerly AFR 40-750).

11. Appeals and Grievances. To file a grievance or appeal, a faculty member uses:
    • AFI 36-1201, Discrimination Complaints (formerly AFR 40-1613).
   • AFI 36-1203, Appeal and Grievance Procedures (formerly AFR 40-771).
   • The Merit Systems Protection Board rules.
   • The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

12. Civilian Faculty Performance Appraisal. Once a year, supervisors evaluate all civilian faculty
members who are covered by this instruction. EXCEPTION: Those members who are serving in posi-
tions for 120 days or less will not be evaluated. See Attachment 3 for information on the Civilian Faculty
Performance Appraisal System.

13. Benefits:
   13.1. Leave, Health Benefits, Life Insurance, and Retirement. Civilian members of the faculty
   are entitled to all regular civil service benefits such as annual leave, leave without pay (leave of
   absence), sick leave, health and life insurance, and retirement on the same basis as employees of the
   competitive civil service. See the Federal Personnel Manual and applicable Air Force policy direc-
   tives and instructions for benefits.
   13.2. Leave for Professional Development. You may grant leave for professional development
   when the leave will contribute significantly to improving or furthering the mission of the institution.
   Applicants for such leave must present evidence that they plan to use the time for scholarly or profes-
   sional activities that will advance their professional standing and enrich their teaching upon return.
       13.2.1. Duty Assignment. Absence for professional development is a duty assignment and may
       be authorized for up to 1 year. The individual receives his or her regular salary and appropriate
       supporting costs. The Air Force encourages gaining organizations to offset part or all of the costs.
       13.2.2. Faculty Responsibility. A faculty member who accepts such absence assumes an obliga-
       tion to continue to serve following his or her return to regular duty. AU/CC or SUPT or their des-
       ignee determines the employees mandatory service obligation before releasing the employee for
       training or professional development. The faculty member must reimburse the Air Force for
       tuition and incidental expenses associated with the professional development if he or she fails to
       fulfill this obligation.
       13.2.3. Academic Degrees. Normally, the granting of leave for professional development may
       not be used to pursue formal education for the sole purpose of obtaining an advanced degree.

14. Long-Term Training and Education Program. Civilian members of the faculty are eligible to par-
ticipate in the Air Force Long-Term Training and Education Program. The program provides comprehen-
sive training or education for employees who have significant changes in their responsibilities, or need the
training to accomplish the Air Force mission. Under this program, employees receive tuition, travel, per
diem (or transportation of dependents and household goods in lieu of per diem), and salary. If the faculty
member accepts this opportunity for training or education, he or she must complete a service agreement.


                                                 4
If the member does not fulfill this obligation, he or she must reimburse the Air Force for the tuition and
incidental expenses associated with the education program.

15. Classification, Titling, and Coding. OPM classification standards do not apply to employees who
are covered by this instruction since they fall under the exclusions of 5 U.S.C. 5102. Modified core doc-
uments reflect the academic rank, duties, performance standards, and responsibilities for each faculty
member. Record an employee’s status (for example, on SF 50B, Notification of Personnel Action) as
follows:
   15.1. Position Title and Number. Academic rank (for example, Professor, Associate Professor) or
   title (for example, Registrar, Head Coach, Director of Academic Affairs). You may use a parentheti-
   cal title identifying the subject taught (for example, Professor (Electrical Engineering)). Limit the
   title to 54 characters.
   15.2. Pay Plan. Administratively determined (AD).
   15.3. Numeric Designators. Numeric designators are not grades, but serve as identifiers for aca-
   demic rank or academic administrative positions.
       15.3.1. 21 - Instructor.
       15.3.2. 22 - Assistant Professor.
       15.3.3. 23 - Associate Professor.
       15.3.4. 24 - Professor.
       15.3.5. 25 - Administrative Faculty.
       15.3.6. 27 - School Deans.
       15.3.7. 28 - Director of Academic Affairs.
   15.4. Step Rates. Step rates on the Faculty Pay Schedule at which members are paid.
   15.5. Form Prescribed. AF Form 197, Air Force Institute of Technology Faculty Performance
   Appraisal.

                         COMPARABILITY ADJUSTMENTS FORMULA

A1.1. Background. The Faculty Pay Plan is adjusted at the same time as the General Schedule (GS).
Use the methods described in paragraph A1.2. to adjust the Faculty Pay Plan. The schedule has 59 steps
for Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, Professor, and Administrative Faculty; and nine
additional steps for Senior Administrators. Additional steps may be added as required to form alternate
schedules.

A1.2. Schedule Computation. Steps 1, 17, 31, 53, 80, and 88 are linked with specific grades and steps in
the GS:
   A1.2.1. Give step 1 the same percentage increase as GS-7, step 1.
   A1.2.2. Give step 17 the same percentage increase as GS-11, step 3.
   A1.2.3. Set intervening steps between 1 and 17 by adding increments successively to step 1, with the
   increment derived by dividing the difference between step 1 and step 17 by 16.
   A1.2.4. Give step 31 the same percentage increase as GS-12, step 6.
   A1.2.5. Intervening steps between 17 and 31 are derived in the same manner as those between steps
   1 and 17, except that the difference between steps 17 and 31 is divided by 14.
   A1.2.6. Give step 53 the same percentage increase as GS-15, step 3.
   A1.2.7. Intervening steps between 31 and 53 are derived in the same manner as those between steps
   1 and 17, except that the difference between steps 31 and 53 is divided by 22.
   A1.2.8. Steps 54 through 59 are an extrapolation of the line from steps 31 to 53. That is, steps 54 to
   59 are derived by adding the same increment that was added for steps from 31 to 53. To compute step
   54, add the increment to the new step 53.
   A1.2.9. (For Alternate Schedule Only) compute steps 60 and above by adding the same increment
   that was added for steps 54 through 59.
   A1.2.10. The Senior Administrator (steps 80 through 88) are derived as follows:
       A1.2.10.1. Grant step 80 the same percentage increase received by steps 54 and 55 combined.
       A1.2.10.2. Grant step 88 the same percentage increase as the SES increase.
       A1.2.10.3. Intervening steps between 80 and 88 are derived in the same manner as those between
       steps 1 and 17 except the divisor is 8.
   A1.2.11. U.S.C. 5308 limits the Faculty Pay Plan to salary rates that may not exceed the salary for
   level IV of the Executive Schedule; therefore, pay caps and salary ceilings imposed on the GS affect
   rates on this plan.

                CIVILIAN FACULTY PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL SYSTEM

A3.1. Background. Supervisors will evaluate individual faculty in accordance with this instruction.

A3.2. Operating Instructions. The AU/CC and the SUPTdevelop implementing instructions for the
performance appraisal system.
   A3.2.1. Definitions:
       A3.2.1.1. Civilian Faculty Performance Appraisal System. A system which identifies critical
       performance elements, establishes performance standards, communicates elements and standards
       to individual faculty members, establishes performance appraisal procedures and methods, and
       guides the use of appraisal information in making personnel decisions.
       A3.2.1.2. Performance. Faculty members’ accomplishment of assigned duties and responsibili-
       ties.
       A3.2.1.3. Performance Element. Any major functional component of a position for which the
       faculty member is held accountable and performance of which contributes meaningfully to suc-
       cess or failure in performing the duties of that position.
       A3.2.1.4. Performance Standards. Performance standards describe the expected level of com-
       petence of each performance element.
       A3.2.1.5. Performance Appraisal. Comparison, under an appraisal system, of performance of
       duties and responsibilities with the established performance standards.
       A3.2.1.6. Progress Review. Review of the faculty member’s work progress during the appraisal
       period. It requires discussion between the supervisor and faculty member regarding how well the
       faculty member is achieving the established performance standards. Supervisors will conduct
       periodic progress reviews and document them on AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief.
       A3.2.1.7. Rater. Immediate supervisor.
       A3.2.1.8. Reviewer. Normally the rater’s supervisor.
   A3.2.2. Performance Elements and Performance Standards:
       A3.2.2.1. The basic functions and responsibilities of a faculty member are teaching, research
       (scholarly and professional accomplishment), and service and administration.
       A3.2.2.2. All three functions are major job requirements and are considered critical to successful
       performance of the job.
       A3.2.2.3. The supervisor, with appropriate faculty consultation, determines standards for each
       performance element. The standards reflect the individual’s assigned duties.
       A3.2.2.4. Write standards that define a successful level of accomplishment for each performance
       element.
       A3.2.2.5. The supervisor provides the faculty member a copy of his or her performance elements
       and standards no later than 30 calendar days after the beginning of the rating period. The supervi-
       sor may record the performance elements and standards on an AF Form 197, Air Force Institute

                                                9
   of Technology Faculty Performance Appraisal. The supervisor and faculty member must dis-
   cuss performance expectations to make sure that each individual understands what is expected of
   the other. The faculty member, the supervisor, and the reviewer must sign the form. The faculty
   member’s signature indicates only that the performance elements and standards have been
   received and discussed. The supervisor or the faculty member may initiate a change in perfor-
   mance elements and standards during the rating period Note: The employee must perform for at
   least 90 days’ before he or she is appraised. The reviewer must approve a change substantiated by
   the supervisor. The change is then presented in writing and discussed with the faculty member.
A3.2.3. Appraisals. Appraise all faculty members once a year, following the established perfor-
mance standards and local instructions.
A3.2.4. Levels of Performance:
   A3.2.4.1. The rater rates each performance element by marking the appropriate block: "Did Not
   Meet" or "Met."
   A3.2.4.2. Use the following criteria to assign the overall performance rating which best describes
   the employee’s overall performance:
   S - Successful. This rating is assigned when the faculty member meets the requirements of all the
   elements of the work plan.
   M - Marginal. This rating may be assigned when a faculty member does not meet the require-
   ments of an element and overall performance is acceptable. The ratee must take prompt corrective
   action.
   U - Unacceptable. Assign this rating when the faculty member does not meet the requirements of
   an element and overall performance is unacceptable.
