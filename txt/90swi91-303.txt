This instruction establishes policies and procedures for operations during cold weather. Compliance is
mandatory for all 90 SW units.
Maintain and dispose of records created as a result of prescribed processes in accordance with the Air
Force Records Disposition Schedule (AFRIMS). Comply with AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program, for
documents containing Privacy Act information. Comply with DoD Regulation 5400.7/Air Force Supple-
ment/AFSPCSUP1, DoD Freedom of Information Act Program, Chapter 4, for documents containing For
Official Use Only information.


1. Purpose. To safeguard Air Force assets and personnel by providing medically-based cold weather risk
management guidance for all Francis E. Warren (FEW) AFB units.

2. Responsibilities. Unit commanders are ultimately responsible for maintaining a safe work environ-
ment. As weather conditions warrant, commanders may impose greater chill temperature restrictions than
those outlined in the base matrix and group attachments. Commanders, functional managers, and supervi-
sors will:
   2.1. Ensure applicable guidance for the workplace and operations are available to all personnel.
   2.2. Conduct job safety analysis for each work task not governed by technical order, other definitive
   guidance, or anytime a new work task or process is introduced to determine potential cold weather
   hazards.

3. Definitions.
   3.1. Actions: Steps directed and taken to mitigate the effects of cold weather on personnel working in
   severe weather conditions.
2                                                                    90SWI91-303 30 JANUARY 2006


    3.2. Buddy System: When implemented, two persons (minimum) must be present during the perfor-
    mance of each open-weather task. Each individual will monitor the other for symptoms of frostbite,
    hypothermia, or other cold-related injuries.
    3.3. Cold-related Injuries: Frostnip, Frostbite, Hypothermia, Chilblain, or Trench Foot. Refer to
    Attachment 8: Cold Weather Medical Reference for details.
    3.4. Emergency Work Only: This encompasses work performed in support of peacetime or wartime
    contingencies that must be accomplished to support national objectives or local needs. This includes
    ambulance, police, and fire response. The 90 SW Wing Commander is the waiver authority for devia-
    tions.
    3.5. Essential Mission Work Only: Work performed in support of critical operational or training needs
    as defined by the appropriate group commander. This work will have restrictions and may be modified
    in action. A waiver authority will be required for deviations.
    3.6. Mission Critical: Those missions supporting critical operational/training needs as defined by the
    90 SW/CC. This includes any mission designated as “higher headquarters directed” (HHD) or mis-
    sions generated to support national emergencies or peacetime contingencies.
    3.7. Equivalent Chill Temperature (ECT): A composite apparent temperature that includes both ambi-
    ent air temperature and wind speed considerations. The ECT will be used for defining restrictions and
    actions on work performed by FEW AFB units.
    3.8. No Mission Restrictions: All mission work will be conducted in adherence to established
    work-rest cycles. Minimize all outdoor non-mission related activity.
    3.9. No Restrictions: Equivalent chill temperatures in this category require no additional guidance,
    actions, or waivers.
    3.10. Priority Maintenance: Activity required to safeguard assets or support mission critical tasks.
    3.11. Restrictions: Leadership directs limits governing the type and duration of work accomplished in
    a particular cold weather category.
    3.12. Some Mission Work Restrictions: Some mission work may have restrictions or need to be mod-
    ified in action. A waiver authority will be required for deviations.
    3.13. Waiver Authority: The command level authorized to allow for deviations from this instruction
    for a particular chill weather category. Refer to applicable Table/Attachment for specific level of
    waiver authority required.
    3.14. Warm Up Break: A specified period of time in a heated shelter or vehicle.

4. Equivalent Wind Chill Advisories. 90 OSS/OSW will issue an advisory when the ECT reaches -20
degrees Fahrenheit. A new advisory will be issued and the old one rescinded whe the ECT reaches -40 and
-65 degrees Fahrenheit.
    4.1. Primary notifications will be made via telephone by the Wing Command Post to Group Com-
    manders. All Control Centers (e.g. Wing Security Control, Maintenance Operations Center, Transpor-
    tation Control Center, Communications Job Control, CE Control Center, etc.) will be notified via
    Local Weather Notification System (LWNS).
    4.2. Chill Advisories will be disseminated in accordance with 90 SW Plan 15-1.
90SWI91-303 30 JANUARY 2006                                                                               3


   4.3. Public Affairs, upon notification from Command Post, will post wind chill restrictions and corre-
   sponding actions on the Commander’s Access Channel and the Base Electronic Marquee.

5. Procedures. Table 1. lists the FEW AFB chill restrictions matrix. All values are based on a moderate
work or activity level while wearing appropriate gear. All temperatures are listed in degrees Fahrenheit.
Actions and restrictions are cumulative and will incorporate requirements in warmer ECT categories.
After receiving an advisory, units will refer to the applicable group attachment for more specific guidance.

                              COLD WEATHER MEDICAL REFERENCE

A8.1. Cold Injuries: Recognition & Treatment. Contributing Factors for increased risk to cold injuries
include fatigue, dehydration, nutrition, alcohol, medications (consult your primary care manager), and
improper clothing (tight footwear).
     A8.1.1. Hypothermia is when the core temperature falls below 95 degrees and develops as the rate of
     heat loss exceeds heat production. The symptoms to look for can be remembered as Grumble, Mum-
     ble, Fumble, and Stumble. Move to a warm, sheltered area gently to avoid triggering a cardiac arrest.
     Remove wet clothing and place layers of insulating materials on casualty’s clothing, including the
     head. Have casualty transported to medical treatment facility.
     A8.1.2. Frostnip is when the painful exposed skin blanches (turns pale or white) and loses sensation
     but remains pliable. This is usually found on facial skin, like the tips of the nose and ears. Move to a
     warm area and re-warm by placing fingers in the armpit or blowing warm air over the frozen surfaces.
     Do not rub effected area. Recovery is usually prompt and medical attention is not necessary.
     A8.1.3. Frostbite is a localized lesion caused by freezing, usually affecting the feet, hands, ears, nose,
     and cheeks but can affect any exposed skin. The tissues are hard, insensitive, and white or mottled.
     Move to a warm area and remove clothing gently and begin external warming (warm water). Provide
     warm, sweet fluids if conscious. No attempt should be made to thaw if there is any chance of the
     affected area becoming refrozen. Treat as a burn—do not rub affected areas. Have casualty trans-
     ported to nearest hospital.
     A8.1.4. Chilblain is a mild form of non-freezing cold injury occurring in damp, cold environments
     identified by recurrent, localized itching and painful inflammation. Move to a warm area and allow
     affected body part to re-warm spontaneously. Provide adequate protective clothing before resuming
     normal duties. Seeking medical attention in a medical treatment facility is not necessary.
     A8.1.5. Trench Foot is a non-freezing cold injury identified by severe pain, tingling, itching, redden-
     ing of skin, blisters, and numbness. Although “trench foot” suggests lower extremities as the most
     common site, other body parts can be affected. Move to a warm and dry area and allow affected body
     part to re-warm spontaneously. Have casualty transported to medical treatment facility.

A8.2. Recommended Controls for Preventing Cold Injuries.
     A8.2.1. Engineering controls attempt to reduce heat loss from the person as a whole and from
     exposed skin. Engineering controls include the following:
        A8.2.1.1. Providing for general or spot heating including hand warming.
        A8.2.1.2. Providing shielding from wind.
        A8.2.1.3. Reducing conductive heat transfer (avoid use of metal chairs or uninsulated tools).
        A8.2.1.4. Providing warming shelters.
     A8.2.2. Administrative Controls attempt to reduce the exposure time, allow individual control over
     the work, and provide for mutual observation. Administrative controls include the following:
        A8.2.2.1. Setting up work-warming regimen cycles.
90SWI91-303 30 JANUARY 2006                                                                        17


     A8.2.2.2. Schedule work at warmest times.
     A8.2.2.3. Move work to warmer areas.
     A8.2.2.4. Assign additional workers to reduce time on completing task.
     A8.2.2.5. Establish a buddy system, emphasizing mutual observation.
     A8.2.2.6. Avoid long periods of sedentary effort.
     A8.2.2.7. Inform personnel of cold stress hazards and what proper clothing is.
     A8.2.2.8. Provide an adjustment or conditioning period for new employees.
     A8.2.2.9. Provide warm, sweet, non-caffeinated fluids.
  A8.2.3. Personal protection or personal protective equipment (PPE) is fundamental in managing cold
  stress. Employees need to be educated on the roles of clothing items and what compromises their
  effectiveness. PPE includes the following:
     A8.2.3.1. Properly selected insulated clothing to provide wind and moisture barriers.
     A8.2.3.2. Special attention paid to feet, fingers, ears, nose, and face.
     A8.2.3.3. Gloves/mittens based on task being performed and ambient temperature.
     A8.2.3.4. Water barriers to external liquids.
     A8.2.3.5. Appropriate active warming systems such as circulating air or liquids, electric heaters
     or chemical heating pads.
     A8.2.3.6. Appropriate eye protection for snow- or ice-covered terrain.
