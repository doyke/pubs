SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is extensively revised and must be completely reviewed. It standardizes and
clarifies Arming Groups, training frequency, accidental/negligent weapons discharge reporting
procedures, and carrying concealed weapons.
1.5.1.1. (Added) The force used in self-defense must be proportionate to the force used by the
attacker. Use only the minimum force needed against attackers. Use of force is not justified
when the attack stops. Consult the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and host nation or regional laws
regarding parameters of self-defense.
1.6.2.1. (Added) Special Considerations for the Use of Deadly Force within United States
Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). Develop local procedures to ensure personnel are trained to
give warning orders in English and the language of the host nation. The local Staff Judge
Advocate (SJA) must be involved in coordination and approve all local arming and use of force
policies and directives.
1.6.2.2. (Added) Warning shots are prohibited.
1.6.2.2.1. (Added) On persons carrying a firearm, if you think they are about to use it.
1.6.2.2.2. (Added) If there is no other way to protect yourself or others from danger of being
killed or seriously injured.
1.6.2.2.3. (Added) On persons who have, in your sight, killed or seriously injured someone.
1.6.2.2.3.1. (Added) On persons committing any action that could result in damage to property,
which you have been ordered to protect and has been designated by competent authority as vital
to national security.
1.6.2.2.3.2. (Added) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Status of Forces
Agreement (SOFA) and the Partnership for Peace (PfP) SOFA, which incorporates the NATO
SOFA, specifically Article VI authorizes members of the sending state forces to possess and
carry firearms in the performance of their duties when authorized by their orders. Therefore, the
forces of the United States (U.S.), as a sending State, unless prohibited by this instruction,
applicable host nation law, or international agreement, are authorized to carry firearms in the
performance of official duties. Issue in writing whenever possible and after consultation with the
staff judge advocate, authorization for off-base possession and carrying of firearms. Article VII,
paragraph 6 (a) and paragraph 10 (a) and (b) of the NATO SOFA are to be considered in deter-
mining local policy on joint host nation and U.S. investigation and the U.S. forces ability to
perform security functions on or off the installation. Commanders should consult their staff
judge advocate (SJA) for terms of relevant bilateral agreements between the U.S. and host
nations. Activities involving arming and use of force in non-NATO and non-PfP countries must
be evaluated with thorough and advance coordination through the International Law Division
(HQ USAFE/JAI) on a case-by-case basis.
1.6.2.3. (Added) Local Civilian and Host Nation Restrictions. Refer to DoD 4500.54-G,
Department of Defense Foreign Clearance Guide (http://www.fcg.pentagon.mil), for additional
applicable restrictions.
1.6.2.3.1. (Added) Air Force personnel in Italy will not carry firearms outside identified
defense areas except as described in paragraph 1.5.2.5. Special consideration may be given by
AFI31-207_USAFESUP 14 AUGUST 2009                                                                 3


Italian authorities to requests for issuance of a permit to carry a firearm. Forward requests to
Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC)/BA Rome, Italy, through Vice Commander, United States
Air Forces in Europe (USAFE/CV).
1.6.2.3.2. (Added) Air Force personnel in Spain normally will not carry firearms outside of
U.S. military installations. Coordinate with the ODC/JA Madrid, Spain and get authorization
from local authorities before transporting weapons off base.
1.6.2.3.3. (Added) Air Force personnel in Turkey normally will not carry firearms outside
identified defense areas. Consult provisions in USAFEI 51-707, Regulations on Personal
Property, Local Currency, and Motor Vehicles for U.S. Personnel in Turkey.
1.6.2.3.4. (Added) The Commander, United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE/CC), or
designated representative, is the approval authority for off-base weapons movement in the
United Kingdom. Installation commanders are USAFE/CC-designated representatives.
1.6.2.3.4.1. (Added) The installation commander, in coordination with local security force
commanders, will approve in writing the requirements to arm security forces in performance of
routine official duties. Review and update these requirements annually. Consult the staff judge
advocate or the installation’s host nation legal advisor regarding arming of security forces off the
installation.
1.6.2.3.4.2. (Added) The installation commander will approve in writing, with the Royal Air
Force (RAF) commander coordination of all other off-base weapons movements. Forward a
final copy of the approval letter to the HQ USAFE/A7S, Unit 8810 Box 245, APO AE 09459-
0245 (RAF Mildenhall, United Kingdom). The agency requesting the movement will meet the
regulatory requirements and the spirit and intent of AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation
Security Program, and with regard to weapons protection, use the installation security plan
during higher threat conditions.
1.8. Use of Force Training. Commanders will ensure their units have sufficient number of
instructors trained to provide annual Use of Force (UoF) and Rules of Engagement (ROE).
Combat Arms provides basic UoF/ROE training during weapons training. The training Combat
Arms provides does not full fill annual UoF/ROE requirements.
1.8.1. Commanders will ensure UoF and weapons qualification dates are tracked to validate
weapons arming list. Individuals will not be added to weapons arming lists if either their
weapons qualification or UoF have expired.
1.8.2. Security Forces training flights will conduct the annual UoF classroom and practical
training for Security Forces Airmen.
2.1.1.1. Non-arming Group A Airmen/units classified as enablers, those who routinely deploy
multiple times each year, have a Mission Capability Statement (MISCAP) or Designed
Operational Capability (DOC) statement requiring short notice deployments are considered
arming Group B. Using historical deployment data, Wing commanders may require a specific
percentage of these Airmen to maintain annual weapons qualifications and UoF/ROE training.
The goal is to train only those Airmen needing training, not every Airman within the wing for the
sake of flexibility. Sustainment/proficiency training is not required. This qualification will be
valid for one year and pre-deployment weapons’ training is not required. This process does not
apply to USAFE Aircrew who will follow qualification guidelines in accordance with 11 series
4                                                    AFI31-207_USAFESUP 14 AUGUST 2009


Mission Design Series (MDS) Review and Approval (RAP) Tasking memoranda. All USAFE
Airmen deploying on Joint Expeditionary Taskings will be required to qualify per reporting
instructions.
2.1.1.1.1. (Added) USAFE (Germany only) Civilian Security Police, Zivilpolizei (ZP) will not
conduct sustainment training. The ZP will remain category A and the weapons they qualify on
will be determined by the Security Forces Commander and they will remain qualified for 1 year.
2.1.2.5. (Added) Unless provided for in a bilateral or international agreement, the United
States, as a sending State, is obliged under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and the Partnership for Peace (PfP) SOFA, Article II, to
“respect the law of the receiving State and to abstain from any activity inconsistent with the spirit
and intent of the present Agreement (SOFA).” In developing local procedures and policies,
commanders should clearly distinguish between military police activities on and off the
installation. Article VII, paragraph 10b, of NATO/PfP SOFA states that off-base activities of
military police are “subject to arrangements with the authorities of the receiving State and in
liaison with those authorities.” Additionally, regional or state host nation laws may vary on
issues such as use of handcuffs, self-defense, and other issues. Therefore, when performing
activities off the installation, it is required that some level of coordination take place with the
appropriate host nation authorities. For all activities, commanders must coordinate local
procedures with the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA) and the installation host nation attorney.
2.1.2.5.1. (Added) The HQ USAFE/A7S Chief and Deputy Chief of Security Forces are
authorized to act as principal appointees for Commander, United States Air Forces in Europe
(COMUSAFE).
2.1.2.5.2. (Added) The 435th Security Forces Squadron (SFS) Deputy Commander and
numbered flight commanders are authorized to act as principal appointees for the 435th SFS.
2.2.1. Use the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM)-declared threat level. If the threat level
is declared critical, and personnel already have an extension, those personnel must fire as soon as
possible (circumstances permitting).
2.3.2. Commanders will establish procedures to ensure Airmen in their unit precluded from
having weapons are not scheduled for weapons training or any events where they may be
required to use/carry weapons.
2.4.2.1. (Added) USAFE Combat Arms Instructors will not conduct training or task
certification of unit personnel on Use of Force. Combat Arms will provide a basic briefing with
no evaluation as a part of the weapons qualification training class.
2.4.4. Unit UoF/ROE instructors will provide training once Airmen are tasked to deploy.
2.5.1.1. For German Units Only: Use USAFE Form 84, Richtlinien der U.S. Luftstreitkräfte
über die Sicherheit im Umgang Schußwaffen und die Anwendung von Gewalt ( Air Force Policy
Statement Firearms Safety and Use of Force) for local national employees. USAFE Form 84 is a
German translation of Air Force Policy Statement - Firearms Safety and Use of Force. German
Civilian contract guards sign the form to acknowledge understanding of United States Air Force
(USAF) Use of Force Policy.
2.5.1.1.1. (Added) For Security Forces (SF) units only, flight commanders or flight chiefs will
verify all weapons qualifications, UoF and DD Form 2760, Qualification to Possess Firearms or
AFI31-207_USAFESUP 14 AUGUST 2009                                                               5


Ammunition, currency at the beginning of each duty cycle. A blotter entry will be made showing
the results of the review.
2.5.2.3.1. (Added) Provide written notification of the withdrawal action to the affected person
and the servicing armory within 24 hours of oral notification.
2.5.5.1. (Added) Personnel authorized to carry concealed firearms will retain AF Form 523,
USAF Authorization to Bear Firearms.
2.6. Arming Plans. Publish rules of engagement for deadly force during periods of conflict in
local contingency plans.
2.7.1. General officers planning to travel to a NATO country to which they are not permanently
assigned should contact their SJA or the U.S. embassy military liaison representative, as well as,
the Transportation Management Office to ensure compliance with host nation laws, notifications,
and transportation requirements.
2.11. Firearms Qualification Extensions. Airmen are prohibited from deploying with a
qualification extension. Airmen must receive live fire weapons qualification training from Air
Force Combat Arms or other approved source prior to deployment in accordance with AFI 36-
2226 paragraph 5.13.1.
2.11.1. Combat Arms will update the Security Forces Management Information System with all
qualification extensions.
2.11.2.3.1. (Added) The granting authority is the munitions support squadron commander
(MUNSS)/CC.
2.11.3.1. (Added) The major command (MAJCOM) arming authority is HQ USAFE/A7S.
