required) approximately 30 days before a selection board convenes. Verify eligibility and nominate qual-
ified officers for PV Promotion consideration. Senior rater signature on the PRF certifies the validity of
the vacant position and the eligibility of the officer. Provide these officers a copy of the PRF approxi-
mately 30 days before the PV Board convenes.

1.7. Eligible Officer. Monitors own eligibility and ensures own selection record is correct and
up-to-date before the convening of the selection board.
   1.7.1. Reviews OPB for accuracy of personnel data.

   resolving the "gray" records.
   1.8.5. Ensure the quality of records among panels at the "cut line" is the same if more than one panel
   is scoring a given competitive category.
   1.8.6. Monitor the quality of records in the "gray area" plus the records immediately below and imme-
   diately above the "gray area." If the scoring standards of these records are not consistent, the president
   of the board will take action to resolve inconsistencies (i.e., rescoring by a different panel, etc.).

1.9. Board Members. Board members will acknowledge receipt of materials provided in their notifica-
tion of nomination package. They will perform their duties based on the best interests of the Air Force.
   1.9.1. Will not represent or sponsor any particular career field, command, or any other category of
   officers.
10                                                                        AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003


     1.9.2. Will request relief from SAF if they cannot, in good conscience, perform the duties without
     prejudice or partiality.
     1.9.3. Will request relief, from the SAF or the Secretary of Defense (SecDef), of their obligation not
     to disclose board proceedings if they believe the integrity of the board's proceedings have been
     affected by improper influence of senior military or civilian authority, misconduct by the board presi-
     dent or a member, or any other reason.
     1.9.4. Will report the basis for their belief to the SAF or the SecDef after release from board duties.
     1.9.5. Will use the "whole person concept" to assess each eligible officer's potential to serve in the
     next higher grade. In addition, use the "best and fully qualified" method to select officers for promo-
     tion.

1.10. Board Recorders. The SAF ensures, through the board recorder, that boards consist of a presi-
dent, panel chairpersons, panel members, recorders and administrative support staff. Recorders manage
the flow of records to the board members, answer administrative questions, screen information for presen-
tation to the board, and advise the board president and members on board processes and other administra-
tive matters. Recorders ensure that the provisions of this instruction are carried out for each board.
     1.10.1. Board recorders complete a course of instruction during the 12 months before the selection
     board for which they serve. The course, approved by SAF, covers their duties and responsibilities to
     ensure compliance with law and DoD policy.

     1.10.6. Board recorders will not serve on promotion boards if they have primary responsibilities
     involving the career management of the officers eligible for consideration by a board, or would be
     responsible for the career management of the officers if selected.
     1.10.7. Recorders will request relief from the SAF or the SecDef as outlined in paragraph 1.9.3.

1.11. Administrative Support Staff. Organizes records for presentation to the board, screens informa-
tion for presentation to the board, transcribes scores into a data base and verifies their accuracy, accounts
for rescored records, answers administrative questions, maintains the order of merit established by the
board members' scores, and follows standard written procedures governing the administrative support for
boards.

                                                 Chapter 2

                  PROMOTION ELIGIBILITY AND INELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

2.1. Program Objectives. A promotion is not a reward for past service. It is advancement to a higher
grade based on past performance and future potential. An officer’s first consideration for promotion will
be far enough in advance so that, if recommended for promotion and on an approved selection list, the
officer’s promotion will occur on or before the date the officer reaches the maximum time in grade. How-
ever, during the transition period, officers must also meet the total years service date requirement (see
paragraph 2.2.). Specific objectives:
     2.1.1. Promote officers of the desired quality and quantity through a fair and equitable competitive
     selection system that advances those individuals considered by boards as best qualified.
     2.1.2. Promote officers in sufficient numbers of each grade, as vacancies occur, to maintain the
     strength in each grade for each competitive category.
     2.1.3. Provide reasonably stable, consistent, and visible career opportunities for each competitive cat-
     egory.

2.2. Transition Period. The ROPMA law establishes a 5 year transition period to phase-in the promo-
tion criteria outlined in the new law. The transition period is 1 October 1996 through 30 September 2001.
The time frame is established to allow implementation of all the provisions of the law with as little nega-
tive impact as possible.
     2.2.1. TYSD. The ANG and USAFR will gradually phase out the Total Years Service Date (TYSD)
     eligibility requirement of ROPA during the Transition Period. See Table 2.1. for specific criteria.
     2.2.2. TIG for promotion to Captain. During the transition period, the USAFR will use 4 years
     time-in-grade (TIG) to establish eligibility for promotion consideration to the grade of captain. After
     the transition, TIG will change to 5 years. The Air National Guard will use 5 years during this transi-
     tion period unless otherwise announced.

2.3. Promoting USAFR Second Lieutenants. (For ANG officers, see ANGI 36-2504.) Second lieutenants
on the RASL are eligible for promotion and are normally promoted after completing 2 years of service
starting from their Date of Rank (DOR) as a second lieutenant. If found NOT Qualified for Promotion
(NQP) or a delay is warranted, see Chapter 7. Where there is an unintended delay in an officer’s promo-
tion to first lieutenant by reason of administrative error supporting review as determined by ARPC/CC,
ARPC/CC may adjust the officer’s date of rank and effective date on which it would otherwise have been
effective. Note: Chaplain Candidates, Legal Interns, and Health Professions Scholarship Program Partici-
pants are ineligible for promotion while in these programs.

2.4. Eligibility Criteria and Restrictions. The following criteria are restriction apply for promotions to
grades of captain through lieutenant colonel (ANGUS) through colonel (USAFR) Promotion Eligibility.
     2.4.1. An officer must be currently on the RASL when the board convenes. Additionally, the officer
     must have been on the RASL or the active duty list (ADL) or a combination of these for 1 year before
     the board convenes.
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                             13


  2.4.2. An officer, removed from the RASL and later placed back on the RASL, shall have his or her
  DOR and seniority adjusted to reflect the time spent not on the RASL.
  2.4.3. The mandatory promotion board considers eligible officers for promotion to the grades of cap-
  tain through lieutenant colonel soon enough so that if selected, the IPZ promotion can occur when
  they complete the time in grade as listed in Table 2.1. and Table 2.2. If utilized, Below-the-Promo-
  tion-Zone (BPZ) promotions are for officers eligible for promotion consideration, but junior to offic-
  ers’ eligible IPZ and APZ for their competitive category. However, the Reserve of the Air Force will
  not consider officers for BPZ promotion.
  2.4.4. A USAFR officer, eligible for promotion consideration to colonel, must complete 3 or more
  years time in grade by 30 September of the calendar year in which the board convenes. For promotion
  of ANGUS officers to the grade of colonel, see NGR (AF) 36-4.
  2.4.5. To be promoted, a selected officer must remain on the RASL until their date of rank (DOR)
  unless the officer transfers to the ADL. If the officer transfers to the ADL before DOR, the officer is
  still promoted on the DOR. An officer's promotion becomes void if a selected officer receives an
  assignment to the Inactive Status List Reserve Section (ISLRS) or to the Retired Reserve before the
  DOR. In this case, no promotion occurs until reconsideration and selection of the officer by another
  promotion board.
  2.4.6. An officer may not have a projected removal from the RASL that falls within 90 days after the
  convening date of the board. Waivers may be granted, for lieutenant colonels only, on a case-by-case
  basis. Lieutenant colonels desiring a waiver submit a letter to HQ ARPC/DPJ to arrive not later than
  60 days before the board convening date. Since the PRF must accompany the waiver letter for the
  application to be processed, provide the letter to the MPF to accompany the PRF to HQ ARPC. Once
  approved, the officer will be notified of eligibility to meet the Colonel Promotion Board.
  2.4.7. MAJCOMs and MPFs identify eligible officers using "Reports Processing" in the PRISM
  information system. They will notify the commanders of officers identified as eligible for promotion
  consideration.
  2.4.8. All officers eligible for promotion consideration to the grade of lieutenant colonel and USAFR
  officers eligible for consideration to the grade of colonel will have an AF Form 709, Promotion Rec-
  ommendation (PRF) completed and submitted to the selection board. Each board announcement let-
  ter, sent prior to selection boards, will include specific instructions for completing the PRF.
  2.4.9. ANG/DP gives HQ ARPC/DPJA a list of all ANGUS candidates ineligible for each promotion
  board.
  2.4.10. HQ ARPC/DPJA screens all identified candidates to verify eligibility for promotion consider-
  ation.
  2.4.11. Officers who voluntarily remain on LEAD for subsequent tours, will be transferred to the
  ADL at the three-year and one day point and compete for promotion under DOPMA provisions
  (ADL) when they meet the established promotion eligibility criteria. LEAD officers who desire to
  remain promotion eligible under ROPMA provisions (RASL) must return to the AFR/ANG for a min-
  imum of one year prior to returning to LEAD. Officers who are voluntarily returned to lead before the
  one-year has expired will have orders generated that are greater than three years, which automatically
  places them of the ADL.

2.5. Purpose of the PV Program. Promotions under this program maintain a balanced force by giving
commanders the means to nominate exceptionally well qualified candidates for promotion to fill vacan-
cies in the grades of captain through lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserve.
     2.5.1. Immediate supervisors and senior raters base their recommendations on individual merit and
     demonstrated potential for service in the higher grade. Officers are not entitled to a PV nomination
     simply because they occupy a higher graded position or because of their seniority to any other officer.
     2.5.2. PV Boards convene in conjunction with annual promotion boards convened under Title 10
     U.S.C., Section 14101(a). HQ ARPC/DPJ provides MAJCOMs and the MPFs information on each
     PV selection board. MPFs send the information to the units they service.

2.6. Vacancy Determination. For PV promotion nomination to the grade of captain through lieutenant
colonel, the officer must occupy a position with an authorized grade higher than the officer’s current
grade. Base the vacancy determination on the following criteria.
     2.6.1. The position vacancy must be within the nominee’s duty Air Force Specialty (DAFS) (exclud-
     ing prefix and suffix) in an organization managed by the nominating senior rater.
     2.6.2. A position vacancy is defined as within the nominee’s DAFS if the number of officers assigned
     in the next or higher grades (up to and including lieutenant colonel) is less than the number of officers
     authorized in the next or higher grades (up to and including lieutenant colonel). See Attachment 4 for
     specifics for each grade.
     2.6.3. When determining vacancies within a DAFS, compute authorized and assigned figures sepa-
     rately for each Reserve category (i.e., Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs), Individual Mobilization Aug-
     mentees (IMAs), Active Guard Reserve (AGR), traditional unit participants, etc.). Geographically
     separated units will be considered separately when determining vacancies.
     2.6.4. When computing the number of officers assigned by grade to a particular DAFS, do not count
     officers who, within 90 days after the board convening date, are either projected for reassignment
     from the senior rater’s organization or have an established date for removal from the RASL. If their
     date of assignment from the senior rater’s organization or removal from the RASL, is projected to be
     later than 90 days after the board convening date, count these officers in determining the number
     assigned.

2.7. Eligibility Criteria.
     2.7.1. First lieutenants, captains, and majors in the Selected Reserve are eligible for PV promotion
     consideration when they:
        2.7.1.1. Have an outstanding record, with at least 50 credit points for a year of satisfactory federal
        service during the last full retention/retirement (R/R) year.
        2.7.1.2. Complete the required time in grade (see Table 2.1.) by the last day of the month before
        the selection board convenes.
        2.7.1.3. Deleted.
     2.7.2. Officers nominated for PV promotion must occupy, or be reassigned to, the position for which
     nominated at the time of submission of the PRF. To receive the promotion, the officer must be
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                                15


   assigned to the position for which nominated, at the time of the public release of the board’s results.
   See paragraph 2.9. for the exception.
       2.7.2.1. The unit in which the vacancy exists cannot be scheduled for deactivation within 1 year
       of the board's convening date.
       2.7.2.2. The position must be authorized at a higher grade than the nominee’s current grade. The
       grade must not be lowered and the position must remain on the Unit Manning Document (UMD)
       and be funded for at least one year from the board’s convening date.
   2.7.3. Are recommended by their senior rater on a PRF.
   2.7.4. The nominee must be the incumbent (not a UMD overage) in the position for which nominated.

2.8. Identifying Eligible Officers. All MPFs identify officers tentatively eligible for PV nomination
using “Reports Processing” in PRISM. They in turn, will notify the commanders of officers identified as
tentatively eligible.

2.9. Ineligible Officers. An officer is ineligible for promotion consideration or PV promotion if the
officer:
   2.9.1. Is retired (see AFI 36-3203, Service Retirements).
   2.9.2. Deleted.
   2.9.3. Is currently on a mandatory promotion list or eligible for consideration by a mandatory board
   (IPZ). Was considered by a mandatory Reserve of the Air Force (ResAF) captain, major, or lieutenant
   colonel selection board, but not recommended for promotion (the officer cannot be once passed over
   for promotion and then nominated for PV promotion to the same grade as passed over).
   2.9.4. Declined a ResAF promotion to captain, major, or lieutenant colonel (the officer cannot decline
   a promotion and then be nominated for PV promotion to the same grade).
   2.9.5. Was removed from a ResAF promotion recommendation list, for promotion to the same grade,
   by a propriety of promotion action.
   2.9.6. Was selected for PV promotion but, subsequently reassigned from the position for which nom-
   inated on the PRF on or before the public release date of the results of the selection board. EXCEP-
   TION: Any officer who is reassigned from the position for which nominated, with an EDCSA prior to
   public release date, may retain the PV promotion as long as the new position is at least one grade
   higher than their current grade, the criteria in paragraph 2.7. are met, and both the gaining and losing
   senior rater concur with the PV promotion. The gaining senior rater will forward a letter of concur-
   rence to HQ ARPC/DPJ before public release.
   2.9.7. Is coded as an UMD overage.
NOTE: Do not backdate a reassignment for a promotion. If the nominated officer’s position is redesig-
nated due to reorganization, the officer is still eligible for promotion. The grade authorization, AFSC, and
duties must remain the same. MAJCOM manpower personnel must confirm the position's transfer if the
position control number changes. If position control numbers change for officers nominated for PV pro-
motion, AFRC unit commanders must report these changes to the MPF. MPFs notify HQ ARPC/DPJA as
quickly as possible, in writing, before the board convenes.

2.10. Nominating Officers To Fill Vacancies. Nominate an officer to fill only one vacancy. Nominate
only one officer per vacancy. NOTE: Identify a vacancy by its position control number.
     2.10.1. The official recommending a PV promotion notifies the officer of the recommendation. The
     officer may then request an officer preselection brief (OPB) through the servicing MPF.
     2.10.2. Senior raters complete a PRF to nominate an eligible officer for PV promotion. The senior
     rater may take recommendations from the officer’s supervisor for inclusion on the PRF. Board
     announcement letters, sent before each selection board, will include specific instructions for comple-
     tion of the PRF.
     2.10.3. HQ ARPC/DPJA must receive the completed PRF not later than 60 calendar days before the
     board convening date.
     2.10.4. HQ ARPC/DPJA verifies that each recommended officer is eligible. HQ ARPC/DPJA returns
     recommendations to the servicing MPF for ineligible officers.
     2.10.5. The senior rater submitting the recommendation must notify HQ ARPC/DPJA, in writing, as
     quickly as possible, when changes occur before the date of rank (DOR). These changes include when:
        2.10.5.1. The officer becomes ineligible.
        2.10.5.2. The officer becomes unavailable to fill the vacancy.
        2.10.5.3. The Air Force eliminates the position.
        2.10.5.4. The position is downgraded or deleted from the UMD.

                                                  Chapter 3

                         ORGANIZATION OF THE SELECTION PROGRAM

3.1. Convening of Selection Boards. Whenever needed, the SAF will convene a selection board to rec-
ommend officers for promotion to the next higher grade, for consideration for continuation, or selective
early removal from active status.
     3.1.1. Mandatory Promotion Boards. The numbers of officers In- and Above-the-Promotion-Zone (I/
     APZ) are based on the projected needs of the Air Force, within each competitive category, over the
     next 5 years. It also includes the number of officers who require consideration before reaching their
     maximum time in grade (see Table 2.1. and Table 2.2.).
     3.1.2. Position Vacancy Promotion (PV) Boards. The number of officers selected in each competitive
     category for a PV promotion depend on the number of positions vacant and the number of officers
     both best and fully qualified for promotion, out of the officers nominated for promotion.
     3.1.3. Continuation Boards. Convening of continuation boards is based solely on the needs of the Air
     Force for retaining officers in a specific AFSC for a specific period of time. When necessary, SAF
     will establish a quota of officers eligible for continuation. To be eligible for consideration by a contin-
     uation board, an officer must be twice deferred for promotion to the next higher grade or the officer
     reaches the maximum time in service for their grade (lieutenant colonel and colonel). Additionally,
     the officer must make application for consideration when offered the opportunity to apply.
     3.1.4. Selective Early Removal Boards. Whenever the SAF determines there are too many officers in
     a specific grade and competitive category with at least 30 years of commissioned service or 20 years
     of satisfactory federal service for retirement, the SAF may convene a board to recommend officers for
     removal from the RASL.

3.2. Selection Board Composition. The SAF ensures that board membership consists of at least five or
more officers who are senior in grade to the eligible officers. Divide selection boards consisting of more
than five officers into panels of at least five officers each, to enable the board to complete its work in a
reasonable time. Panels are subdivisions of the board and will have as broad a representation of MAJ-
COMs, career areas and aeronautical ratings as possible.
     3.2.1. At least half the selection board membership must be ResAF officers not on the active duty list
     (ADL). At least one officer from each component (active duty, ANG, USAFR), and one officer from
     each competitive category considered must be part of the board membership.
NOTE: For promotion to ANGUS Colonel, only ANG and active duty officers comprise the selection
board. For promotion to USAFR Colonel, only USAFR and active duty officers comprise the selection
board.
     3.2.2. A selection board need not include an officer from a competitive category if no officer of that
     competitive category on the RASL or ADL holds a permanent grade higher than the grade of the offic-
     ers considered by the board. However, in such a case, the SAF may appoint as a member of the board
     a retired officer of that competitive category who holds a higher grade than the grade of the officers
     under consideration.
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                              19


  3.2.3. No officer may serve on two consecutive boards for promotion to the same competitive cate-
  gory and grade if the second board will consider any officer considered and not selected by the first
  board.
  3.2.4. Selection board membership will reflect the eligible population in terms of minority and
  women officers, MAJCOM of assignment, and component when practical. Even if no females or
  minorities meet a particular selection board, at least one female or one minority officer will be a mem-
  ber of each board.
  3.2.5. Large MAJCOMs will not dominate the board membership; ensure reasonable representation
  of smaller commands over time. Board membership will also contain rated and nonrated officers from
  Regular Air Force (RegAF), ANGUS and USAFR (EXCEPTION: No ANGUS representation for
  Reserve Colonel Promotion Board).
  3.2.6. Structure board membership for the judge advocate, chaplain and health professions competi-
  tive categories to ensure no more than two voting members (or less than a majority for a larger board)
  are from the competitive category under consideration. The remaining voting members will be line
  officers, except for boards considering health professions competitive categories where other voting
  members may be officers from other health professions competitive categories.
  3.2.7. Board members (other than the president and panel chairpersons) for the lieutenant colonel and
  colonel boards must be in the grade of colonel. (EXCEPTION: A judge advocate board member may
  be a brigadier general.) The panel chairperson for all promotion panels will be a Line of the Air Force
  officer, of the appropriate grade, for the officers under consideration by a board.
  3.2.8. The president of the captain board and panel chairpersons for the lieutenant colonel and colonel
  boards must be in the grade of brigadier general or above. The president of the major, lieutenant colo-
  nel, and colonel boards must be at least a major general.
  3.2.9. The board presidency rotates among RegAF, ANGUS and USAFR for captain, major and lieu-
  tenant colonel boards, and between RegAF and USAFR for USAFR colonel boards.

                                      CONDUCTING THE BOARD

4.1. Program Objectives. The fundamental purposes are to select officers, through a fair and competi-
tive process:
     4.1.1. For promotion to positions of increased responsibility and authority and to provide the neces-
     sary career incentive to attract and maintain a quality officer force.
     4.1.2. For continuation if the SAF determines there is a need for additional officers in specific grades
     and competitive categories.
     4.1.3. For selective early removal from the RASL of officers meeting specific criteria outlined in
     Chapter 11.

4.2. Rules Governing All Boards. When the board is in session, it works directly for the SAF under the
supervision of the board president. No person may:
     4.2.1. Direct a particular individual be selected or not selected by the board.
     4.2.2. Censure, reprimand or admonish the board or any member of the board for recommendations
     or for exercising any function within the discretion of the board.
     4.2.3. Attempt to coerce or influence, by any means, any action of a board or any board member in
     formulating the board’s recommendation.

4.3. Oaths Administered to Members and Recorders of Selection Boards. Board members must take
an oath (Attachment 3) stating they will perform their duties without prejudice or partiality. Recorders
and administrative staff must take an oath (Attachment 3) stating they will keep a true record of the board
proceedings.

4.4. Instructing Boards. The board president will read the SAF instructions verbatim to the board on the
convening date and provide a written copy to each board member. These instructions will not contain
information on particular officers. Do not modify, withdraw or supplement the instructions after the board
submits its report to the SAF. The instructions must contain the following information.
     4.4.1. For promotion boards, use the text of DoD Instruction 1320.14, Enclosure 4. For continuation
     and selective early removal boards, the SAF will provide specific instructions as they pertain to each
     board.
     4.4.2. Guidelines to ensure the board considers all eligible officers without prejudice or partiality.
     4.4.3. Information or guidelines on the needs of the Air Force for officers with particular skills (if
     necessary), including the need for a minimum or maximum number of officers with particular skills in
     a competitive category. In addition, furnish information or guidelines on officers with particular skills
     as part of the written instruction provided to the board at the time the board convenes.
     4.4.4. Guidelines to ensure the marital status of an officer or the decision by a spouse concerning
     employment, education, or volunteer service will have no effect on the officer’s selection for promo-
     tion, continuation or selective early removal.
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                                 21


   4.4.5. Directions for boards convened to consider officers for promotion to a grade below colonel in
   the Nurse Corps (NC), Biomedical Science Corps (BSC), Medical Corps (MC), and Dental Corps
   (DC) competitive categories to give consideration to an officer's clinical proficiency and skill as a
   health professional to at least as great an extent as the board gives to that officer's administrative and
   management skills.
   4.4.6. Guidelines to prohibit board members, recorders, and administrative staff, or people acting on
   their behalf, from receiving, starting, or participating in communications or discussions involving
   information that this instruction or DoDI 1320.14 does not allow.
   4.4.7. Guidelines for actions if a board member or recorder believes someone is exerting, or attempt-
   ing to exert, inappropriate influence over the board or its proceedings.
   4.4.8. Promotion Boards Only. Supply to the board the maximum number of officers the board can
   recommend IPZ, APZ, or for PV promotion in each competitive category. Determine this number by
   using the guidelines in DoD Instruction 1320.14, Enclosure 3. Do not increase this number, after the
   promotion board convenes, without the written approval of the SAF.
   4.4.9. Continuation and Selective Early Removal Boards Only. Supply to the board, the maximum
   number of officers the board can recommend for continuation or selective early removal within each
   competitive category. This number may not increase without the written approval of the SAF.

4.5. Communications With Boards. The board recorder ensures all communications with the board are
in writing, including guidance from the SAF (for letters from eligible officers, see paragraph 4.7.).
   4.5.1. Board recorders will furnish all written communications to all board members and record them
   as part of the board’s record.
   4.5.2. No one other than the SAF may appear in person to address a selection board on any matter.
   Should the SAF address a board in person, HQ ARPC/DPJ provides a verbatim transcript of the
   SAF’s remarks to every board member and includes it in the record of the board. This does not restrict
   the staff from furnishing administrative information to the board. Board members, recorders, and
   administrative staff may orally communicate routine administrative information to the extent neces-
   sary to facilitate the board’s work.

4.6. Information Provided to Selection Boards. Selection boards use the following items in their delib-
erations.
   4.6.1. The name and official record (outlined in AFI 36-2608, Military Personnel Records System) of
   each eligible officer, including any communication received from that officer, and a factual summary
   of the data contained in the officer’s military personnel file (the Officer Selection Brief [OSB]).
   4.6.2. Letters submitted to selection boards by eligible officers.
   4.6.3. Information not part of the official military personnel record of an officer, but which the SAF
   (or a civilian official appointed by the President, by and with the advice of the Senate and designated
   by the SAF) determines as substantiated and relevant to reasonably and materially affect board delib-
   erations. The SAF (or designee) must ensure the procedures for identifying and proposing such infor-
   mation for consideration applies to all eligible officers In- and Above-the-Promotion-Zone, for all
   eligible officers nominated for consideration for PV Promotion, for continuation and for selective
   early removal for the board concerned. In these cases the SAF ensures the officer:
22                                                                          AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003


        Is notified and provided a copy of the information.
        Is allowed a reasonable opportunity to submit written comments and information.
         Is provided a factual summary of the information, if it is not totally available for reasons of
     national security.
     4.6.4. Administrative information to amplify or clarify the official military records, instruction and
     information provided to the board. The recorders and administrative staff may provide only informa-
     tion outlined in AFI 36-2608.
     4.6.5. Information described in paragraph 4.6.2., 4.6.3. and 4.6.4. will not meet a subsequent board
     unless the information is in the official military personnel record of the officer, or the SAF (or desig-
     nee) makes a new determination. When rendering a new determination, the officer will have the
     opportunity to comment upon notification.

4.7. Letters to Selection Boards. Officers eligible for promotion, continuation or selective early
removal consideration may send a written communication to the board calling attention to any matter con-
cerning themselves that the officer considers important to the officer’s case. Send the letters to HQ
ARPC/DPJA. Letters must have original signatures. HQ ARPC/DPJA will not accept FAX copies for pre-
sentation to the selection board.
     4.7.1. The officer submitting the letter must be able to support any statements made in the letter. The
     officer must sign the letter and place their Social Security Number (SSN) below the signature to
     ensure filing the letter in the correct selection folder.
     4.7.2. Letters should arrive at least 30 days before the board convenes. Letters must arrive no later
     than 0800 the day the board convenes, for consideration by the board.
     4.7.3. HQ ARPC/DPJA destroys letters after the board adjourns. An officer who requests return of the
     letter must provide a stamped, self-addressed envelope.
     4.7.4. The board will not consider letters written by others on behalf of any officer.
     4.7.5. Do not attach anything that may become or is already a part of the officer’s record (such as any
     PRF, Officer Performance Reports [OPR], or decoration narratives).

4.8. Scoring Records. Score records on a best-qualified basis unless otherwise directed by SAF.
     4.8.1. Base selection on the whole person concept, using evidence of potential to serve in a higher
     grade.
     4.8.2. Base all scores on the following:
        4.8.2.1. The material in each officer's official military record.
        4.8.2.2. Any information the SAF may provide to that board according to DoD Instruction
        1320.14.
        4.8.2.3. Any information communicated by letter from the officer concerning his or her own
        record.
     4.8.3. Score records by secret ballot, that is, without benefit of discussion, unless a significant dis-
     agreement (a split; see glossary for definition) occurs in the scores on a particular record. The board
     president approves requests to discuss records that are not splits. Board members may discuss their
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                                23


   own personal knowledge and evaluation of the professional qualifications of eligible officers as long
   as they discuss only matters permitted by law, DoD Directive 1320.12, this instruction, or Secretarial
   guidance and instructions. Board members may not discuss or disclose the opinion of any person not
   a member of the board concerning the officer unless that opinion is in the material for the board under
   DoD Instruction 1320.14.
   4.8.4. Board members from competitive categories other than the line will not score the records of
   officers of the line competitive category.

4.9. Using the Scoring Scale. Boards will use this scoring scale:


                10.0          Absolutely superior
                9.5           Outstanding record
                9.0           Few could be better
                8.5           Strong record
                8.0           Slightly above average
                7.5           Average
                7.0           Slightly below average
                6.5           Well below average
                6.0           Lowest in potential
   4.9.1. Score records separately by competitive category; officers within the same competitive cate-
   gory compete only among themselves for promotion.
   4.9.2. Boards or competitive categories with 100 percent selection quotas may use a “yes” or “no”
   scoring system. A “yes” vote indicates the panel member believes the officer is both fully and best
   qualified for promotion. A “no” vote indicates the officer is not fully qualified.

4.10. Conducting Trial Runs. The board recorder provides board members pre-identified records to
practice scoring and to illustrate some situations the board may encounter during the actual scoring for the
record. The trial run records will not be actual records of officers being considered by the board.
   4.10.1. To the extent practical, the trial run records will be of Reservists representing the broad spec-
   trum of Reserve categories considered by each board.
   4.10.2. After the trial run, board members discuss the records to build on their understanding of the
   Reserve system and to help members assess records they will subsequently score.
   4.10.3. The board president makes the determination if a second trial run is needed.

4.11. Resolving Splits. Board members discuss the record involved in the split and may change scores to
resolve the split or rescore the record. Only board members with split scores may change their scores in
the process of resolving a split. The board president may send the record of an unresolved split to another
panel scoring the same competitive category (if available) or work with the original panel to help resolve
the split. Limit discussion as explained in paragraph 4.8.3.
24                                                                      AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003


4.12. Establishing the Cut Line. The board recorder or administrative support staff totals the scores
from each panel member for each record. List these scores in an order of merit. Panels receive a pro rata
portion of the total board quota that corresponds to the total number of records reviewed by the panel. The
panel applies the quota and ensures the SAF's guidance concerning skill requirements and the consider-
ation of special categories of officers is consistent. The board may discuss and rescore the record of any
officer it determines necessary to give full consideration to the SAF's guidance. Establish a preliminary
cut line after initial scoring.

4.13. Resolving the Gray Area. Board members rescore the records of all officers in the gray area until
a preliminary cut line falls between officers having different scores.

4.14. Establishing a Recommended List.
     4.14.1. Officers above the preliminary cut line will comprise a tentative recommended list.
     4.14.2. All board members for each competitive category review the records at the final cut line to
     certify the officers are both best and fully qualified for promotion, continuation or selective early
     removal.
     4.14.3. Board members will remove from the tentative recommended list any officer not fully quali-
     fied for promotion, continuation or selective early removal, as determined by the board. The board
     recommends the remaining officers to the SAF.

4.15. Identifying "Show Cause" Records. Board members identify officers considered by the board
whose records, in the opinion of a majority of the voting members, indicate the officers must "show
cause" for retention on the RASL.

4.16. Disclosing Board Recommendations. Before signing the board report, board participants may
only disclose board recommendations or proceedings to board participants designated in writing by SAF.
     4.16.1. After the signing of the board report, only the recommendations of the board will be dis-
     closed.
     4.16.2. HQ ARPC/DPJ will determine the Public Release date of results after approval of the board
     report.

4.17. Preparing Board Reports. The board, with the recorders' assistance, prepares a written report to
the SAF on its proceedings. The board report will include the name of any officer the board determines
must “show cause” for retention on active status. Each board member and recorder signs the report certi-
fying:
     4.17.1. To the best of the board member’s knowledge, they complied with DoDI 1320.14 for promo-
     tion boards.
     4.17.2. To the best of the board member’s knowledge, they complied with SAF guidance for contin-
     uation and selective early removal boards.
     4.17.3. They were not subject to, or aware of, any censure, reprimand, or admonishment about the
     recommendations of the board or the exercise of any lawful function within the authorized discretion
     of the board.
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                          25


  4.17.4. They were not subject to, or aware of, any attempt to coerce or influence improperly, any
  action in the formulation of the board’s recommendations.
  4.17.5. They were not party to, or aware of, any attempt at unauthorized communications.
  4.17.6. That, to the best of their knowledge, the board reviewed the records of each officer whose
  name was furnished to the board.
  4.17.7. That the officers recommended for promotion are, in the opinion of the majority of the board
  members, fully qualified and best qualified to meet the needs of the Air Force among those officers
  whose names were furnished to the board.
  4.17.8. That officers recommended for continuation or selective early removal from the RASL do, in
  the opinion of the board members, meet SAF requirements and the needs of the Air Force among
  those officers whose names were furnished to the board.
26                                                                       AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003

                                        POST-BOARD ACTIONS

5.1. Approving Board Reports. The SAF reviews the report and ensures the board acted within the law,
applicable directives, and Secretarial guidelines and processes the report according to Title 10 U.S.C.,
Section 14110 and Section 14111. If the SAF determines the board acted contrary to law, instruction,
DoD Directives, DoD Instructions or guidelines, he or she will return the board report for further proceed-
ings with a written explanation for returning it, as authorized by Title 10 U.S.C., Section 14110. The SAF
may then modify, withdraw, or supplement the initial instructions as a part of that written explanation.
The board will conduct proceedings necessary to revise the report to correct deficiencies and will resub-
mit the report to the SAF. The SAF forwards promotion board results to President, for final approval. For
promotion to the grade of colonel and above, the appropriate authority must obtain the advice and consent
of the Senate. The SAF will approve results and proceedings for continuation and selective early removal
boards.

5.2. Board Recorders’ Responsibilities.
     5.2.1. Collect all score rosters, internal working papers, etc., and ensure board members do not retain
     any board documents.
     5.2.2. Destroy all score rosters and internal working papers associated with the board not part of the
     board report. Do not do this until approval of the board results.
     5.2.3. Identify and retain five benchmark records (provided there are enough records) from among the
     lowest scoring selects and five benchmark records from among the highest scoring nonselects.

5.3. Promotion Secretariat Division Responsibilities (HQ ARPC/DPJ) .
     5.3.1. Prepares board reports as specified in DoD Directive 1320.12, Enclosure 6 and specific guid-
     ance provided by SAF for selection boards. Includes in the board report for SAF review the race/eth-
     nic profile data of the population considered by selection boards for promotion to major, lieutenant
     colonel and colonel (all competitive categories).
     5.3.2. Establishes the public release date for the promotion, continuation and selective early removal
     lists after approval of the board reports.

5.4. Releasing Board Information. HQ ARPC/DPJ releases only the recommendations of the board. Do
not disclose board proceedings, including specific information on how the board scored each record, to
any individual not a member of the board, except as required for the official processing of board results.
Release information on the number of officers considered and selected, board organization, the general
procedures followed by the board, the number of board members and their names, grades, and service
components. Disclose a selection board member’s recommendations only in accordance with law, DoD
Instruction 1320.14, and in the case of continuation or selective early removal boards, SAF guidance.

5.5. Removing an Officer from a Board Report. If the SAF or the SecDef recommends removing an
officer from a board report (Title 10 U.S.C., Section 14111) and the recommendation includes informa-
tion not presented to the board, make the information available to the officer. The authority to remove an
officer from a board report rests with the President. The officer will have a reasonable opportunity to sub-
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                                   27


mit comments on the information to the officials making and reviewing the recommendation. If the
officer cannot have access to the information for reasons of national security, provide the officer, to the
maximum extent possible, an appropriate summary of the information.

5.6. Announcing Board Results. Following approval of the Selection List, HQ ARPC/DPJ will transmit
the board results to the ANGRC, each MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, the Adjutant General of each state, and
MPFs. Each organization removes the list of nonselects and SSNs of selected officers before publicly
releasing the identities of the officers selected. The organization provides the list of nonselects to the com-
manders for their action.

5.7. Notifying Officers Selected for Promotion. See Attachment 6 for sample notification. (NOTE:
Notify ANGUS officers per NGR (AF) 36-4, Federal Recognition of Promotion in the Air National
Guard of the United States and as a Reserve of the Air Force Below the Grade of General Officer.) At the
discretion of the selected officer, notify the officer’s civilian employer (Attachment 7).

       5.7.1.1. The servicing MPF sends commanders a list of officers eligible for promotion 90 calendar
       days before the date of rank (DOR).
       5.7.1.2. The immediate commander notifies selected officers of their DOR (see Table 5.2.) and
       tells them to assume the grade on that date, unless otherwise directed.
   5.7.2. All Other Grades. The immediate commander writes a notice to the selected officers on the
   public release date or as soon as possible. The notice includes the officer's DOR and requests permis-
   sion to inform the officer's civilian employer of the promotion.

       5.7.2.2. Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA) and Participating Individual Ready Reservist
       (IRR) Selectees. The servicing MPF (normally RegAF for IMAs and RegAF/ANG/AFRC unit for
       IRR):
           5.7.2.2.1. Screens selection lists and identifies officers assigned to their command.
           5.7.2.2.2. Gives the selectees' names and DORs to their immediate commanders before the
           public release date.
           5.7.2.2.3. Coordinates with their MAJCOMs or equivalent levels and HQ ARPC/SG/JA/HC/
           DRM to advise commanders not to disclose the information until the public release date.

5.9. Notifying Officers Not Selected for Promotion. The immediate commander of each participating
officer in the grades of first lieutenant through lieutenant colonel notifies the officer of nonselection on
the public release date, or as soon as possible after that date (Attachment 8). Notify ANGUS officers per
NGR (AF) 36-4.
     5.9.1. Immediate commanders will verbally notify officers not selected for promotion to USAFR cap-
     tain, major, lieutenant colonel and colonel.
     5.9.2. Following the first nonselection by a mandatory promotion board (IPZ) for consideration to the
     grades of captain through lieutenant colonel, HQ ARPC/DP will send USAFR officers a letter, after
     public release, notifying them of their nonselection and the ramifications of having failed to be
     selected (Attachment 9 and Attachment 10).
     5.9.3. RegAF MPFs, in coordination with their MAJCOMs or equivalent, USAFR MPFs, and HQ
     ARPC/SG/JA/HC, follow the procedures outlined in paragraph 5.6. to advise commanders of their
     officers not selected for promotion.
     5.9.4. Commanders should notify their PV nominees of their non-selection.

5.10. Failure of Selection for Promotion.
     5.10.1. Once Failed. An officer on the RASL in a grade below lieutenant colonel, in or above the pro-
     motion zone
     established for that officer’s grade and competitive category, is considered once failed of selection for
     promotion if this is the first mandatory consideration and the officer:
        5.10.1.1. Is not recommended for promotion (other than by a PV promotion board).
        5.10.1.2. Declines a promotion for which selected (other than by a PV promotion board).
     5.10.2. Twice Failed. An officer on the RASL in a grade below lieutenant colonel, in or above the
     promotion zone established for that officer’s grade and competitive category, is considered twice
     failed of selection for promotion if any of the following applies:
        5.10.2.1. The officer is considered but not recommended for promotion a second time by a man-
        datory promotion board or a Special Selection Board (SSB) in place of a second mandatory board.
        5.10.2.2. The officer declines a promotion when recommended by a mandatory board or SSB,
        after previously failing selection or previously declining a promotion.
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                                  29


       5.10.2.3. The President removed the officer’s name from the report, or the SecDef removed the
       name from a promotion list after recommendation by a mandatory board or by a SSB and:
          5.10.2.3.1. The officer is not recommended for promotion by the next mandatory promotion
          board or SSB or
          5.10.2.3.2. The President again removes the officer’s name from the report or the SecDef
          removes the name from the list.

5.11. Effect of Twice Failing Promotion to Captain, Major, or Lieutenant Colonel. HQ ARPC reas-
signs twice-deferred officers according to AFI 36-2115, Assignments Within the Reserve Components.
For twice deferred ANGUS officers, refer to NGR (AF) 36-4 for separation procedures. ANG State Head-
quarters separates and reassigns twice-deferred officers according to AFI 36-3209, Separation Proce-
dures for United States Air Force Reserve Members.
   5.11.1. A first lieutenant, twice deferred for promotion to captain, will be separated from the ResAF
   not later than the first day of the seventh month after the month the President approved the board
   report of the board that considered the officer for the second time. EXCEPTION: The SAF may retain
   the officer in order to meet planned mobilization needs. This may not exceed 24 months from the date
   the President approves the report of the board that considered the officer for the second time.
   5.11.2. A captain, twice deferred for promotion to major and not in a continued status, will be sepa-
   rated from the ResAF not later than the first day of the seventh month after the month the President
   approved the board report of the board that considered the officer for the second time.
   5.11.3. A major, twice deferred for promotion to lieutenant colonel and not in a continued status, will
   be removed from the RASL on the first day of the month after the month the officer completes 20

   status, as required above, are entitled to be credited with at least 18 but less than 20 years of satisfac-
   tory service for Reserve retirement, will not be involuntarily reassigned, separated, or transferred from
   an active status before meeting the requirements specified in Title 10 U.S.C., Section 12646 (Attach-
   ment 9 and Attachment 10). Officers who, on the date prescribed for release from active duty (other
   than for training) as required above, are entitled to be credited with at least 18 but less than 20 years
   of active duty for retirement, will not be involuntarily released from active duty (other than for train-
   ing) before becoming eligible for that retirement, or as otherwise specified in Title 10 U.S.C., Section
   12686.

5.12. Administering Promotion Orders. HQ ARPC/DPJ publishes promotion orders for USAFR offic-
ers in accordance with AFI 37-128, Administrative Orders (PA). This authority cannot be delegated.
Notify ANGUS officers per NGR (AF) 36-4.
   5.12.1. After publishing the promotion order, it becomes invalid (see AFI 37-128) if any of the fol-
   lowing occurs before the DOR:
       The officer dies.
       The officer is discharged.
       The officer is assigned to Inactive Status List Reserve Section (ISLRS).
30                                                                        AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003


        The officer is assigned to the Retired Reserve.
        The President removes the officer from the select list.
        The officer is removed from the RASL for any other reason.
     5.12.2. HQ ARPC distributes promotion orders to arrive at the MPF and the officer's address approx-
     imately 2 weeks before the effective date. Address a request for missing orders to HQ ARPC/DPJA.
     Include the officer's name, SSN, grade to which promoted, DOR, order number, and date of the order
     (if known).
     5.12.3. See Table 5.1. to publish promotion orders.

5.13. Date of Rank. See Table 5.2.

5.14. Continuation and Selective Early Removal Board Results. See Chapter 10 for Continuation
Board guidance and Chapter 11 for Selective Early Removal Boards.

NOTES:


     1. The US Senate confirms promotions to colonel and above.
     2. DOR will never be earlier than the public release date.
     3. AGRs will pin on the new rank only if USAFR strength limits are not exceeded and the promotion
        is approved by HQ USAF/RE . (AGRs may delay declination of promotion until date released
        from the tour.)
     4. This date can be no earlier than the public release date (if the officer is in the position at that time),
        or the date the officer is placed in the higher graded position (when after public release date) and
        meets all the criteria. The letter must arrive at HQ ARPC/DPJA 2 business days before the pro-
        posed DOR. See also paragraph 6.5.
     5. HQ USAF/REP makes USAFR colonel promotions incrementally.
     6. Example: A first lieutenant with a DOR of 15 Mar 93, is not selected by the FY98 Captain Pro-
        motion Board. The officer meets the FY99 Captain Promotion Board and is selected. The
        officer’s DOR to captain is 1 October 1998, the first of October of the Fiscal Year of the board.
     7. Calculate the officer’s date as if selected (using the eligibility criteria based on the officer’s ser-
        vice dates) by a Reserve of the Air Force Selection Board. However, at no time will the date be
        sooner than the date of the officer’s transfer to the RASL. Also, see paragraph 6.5.

                                                 Chapter 6

                                   PROMOTION SPECIAL ISSUES

6.1. Missing Officers. Consider and promote missing officers eligible for promotion along with all other
officers. "Missing status" includes:
Missing.
Missing in action.
Interned in a foreign country.
Captured.
Beleaguered.
Besieged by a hostile force.
Detained in a foreign country against the officer's will.

6.2. Posthumous Promotions. Officers on a select list, who die while on the RASL, are eligible to
receive a Posthumous Promotion. The commander sends a priority message (MINIMIZE included)
including the information listed below through the MPF, to HQ ARPC/DPJA, with information copy to
MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU. The request must include the date of death and the circumstances of death. HQ
ARPC/DPJ will process the promotion order and send the published promotion order to the immediate
commander. The commander will present the order to the next of kin. Notify ANGUS officers per NGR
(AF) 36-4. No financial benefits may accrue as a result of a posthumous promotion. Commanders must:
Process the request for a posthumous promotion as soon as possible after the death.
State that the officer was on a select list for promotion (captain through colonel), as of the date of death.
State that a promotion propriety action was not in effect against the officer.

6.3. Requirement for Baccalaureate Degree. After 30 September 1995, no officer will receive a pro-
motion above the grade of first lieutenant, or be federally recognized in a grade above first lieutenant,
unless the officer has earned his/her baccalaureate degree at a qualifying institution. The officer will be
considered by a selection board, but will not be selected for promotion unless either of the following
applies.
   6.3.1. The officer was appointed or assigned for service in a health profession not requiring a bacca-
   laureate degree for original commission.
   6.3.2. The officer was appointed or federally recognized in the grade of captain before 1 October
   1995.

6.4. Transfer of Promotion from the ADL to the RASL. Any officer selected for promotion to a
higher grade, who transfers from the ADL to the RASL of the same armed force, will receive their promo-
tion providing the officer remains in the same competitive category. The officer’s DOR on the RASL is
calculated using the current Reserve of the Air Force requirements for IPZ promotions for the officer’s
competitive category. HQ ARPC/DPJ will award a DOR based on the calculation (see Table 5.2.). NOTE:
Officers must notify HQ ARPC/DPJ to receive further instructions.
34                                                                          AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003


6.5. Accelerated Promotion. An officer, on a promotion list as a result of selection for promotion by a
mandatory promotion board (I/APZ or active duty selection - 10 U.S.C. Chapter 36), may be promoted at
any time to fill a vacant position
     6.5.1. The position and the officer must meet the same vacancy requirements as the PV program, as
     outlined in Chapter 2.
        6.5.1.1. Deleted.
        6.5.1.2. Deleted.
        6.5.1.3. Deleted.
        6.5.1.4. Deleted.
        6.5.1.5. Deleted.
        6.5.1.6. Deleted.
     6.5.2. The commander will complete a letter requesting the accelerated promotion of a selected
     officer (see Attachment 5). The commander will send the letter to the officer’s senior rater for
     endorsement. The senior rater will forward the completed letter to HQ ARPC/DPJA, who will verify
     eligibility and initiate the promotion order.
     6.5.3. The letter requesting accelerated promotion must contain a recommended DOR. This date can
     be no earlier than the public release date (if the officer is in the position at that time), or the date the
     officer is placed in the higher graded position (after public release date).
     6.5.4. The letter requesting the accelerated promotion of a selected officer must arrive at HQ ARPC/
     DPJA 2 business days before the proposed DOR. This allows publication of the order prior to the pro-
     motion.
     6.5.5. Accelerated promotion for USAFR AGRs must also follow the procedures outlined in para-
     graph 6.6. HQ AFRC/DPMO will publish the appropriate orders.

6.6. Promotion Procedures for USAFR AGRs. All HQ AGR officers selected for promotion to the
grade of colonel and below must obtain approval from AF/RE before the officer can assume the higher
grade. For AGRs assigned to HQ AFRC, HQ AFRC/DPM (for lieutenant colonel selects and below), and
HQ AFRC/DPO (for colonel selects) will send the request for the officer to assume the higher grade to
HQ USAF/REAMO for processing to HQ USAF/RE. For other headquarters assigned AGRs, USAF/
REAMO will prepare the request and process it to HQ USAF/RE for approval. HQ AFRC/DPM will pre-
pare the request for all other officer AGRs, and send it to AFRC/CV for approval. The memo will include
a recommendation for promotion, position control number, PAS code, and authorized grade for the posi-
tion to which assigned.

6.7. ANG and USAFR officers are eligible to compete for position vacancy and mandatory promotion on
the Reserve Active Status List (RASL), when the promotion board is convened IAW Title 10 USC
14101(a), while the officers are mobilized under Title 10 USC 12302 commonly known as partial mobili-
zation.
     6.7.1. For USAFR Colonel selects only while mobilized under Title 10 USC 12302: (for normal pin
     on rules see AFI 36-2115, Assignments within the Reserve Components para 1.5.5.4 applies)
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                               35


     6.7.1.1. Officers may elect to voluntarily delay their promotions IAW Title 10 USC 14312 and
     Chapter 8 of this AFI. They may elect to pin on their promotions on promotion effective date-
     with or without having a higher graded reserve billet. If the Colonel select does not have a higher
     graded reserve billet, the member may continue to look for a higher graded billet for up to 6
     months after promotion effective date or 45 days after the member is demobilized whichever is
     later.
     6.7.1.2. Colonel Selects who have a higher graded reserve billet may have their promotions accel-
     erated to a date no earlier than Senate Confirmation if they already are incumbent in a higher grade
     reserve billet during the time they are mobilized under this statute and they meet the accelerate
     guidelines of this AFI in Chapter 6 .
     Note that AGR colonel selects may be involuntarily delayed in pin on due to strength limitations
     of the AGR force imposed by law. Paragraph 8.7. of this AFI applies to mobilized AGRs as well.
  6.7.2. For USAFR Colonel selects not mobilized upon actual pin-on date; If the officer has not
  located a vacant colonel authorization, the MPF should project the officer for assignment to ARPC
  (non selected reserve) with an EDCSA of 6 months from pin-on date. At 60 days prior to EDCSA (4
  months after pin-on date), if the officer has still not yet located a vacant colonel position, the MPF
  should, through command channels, request a stop loss waiver to allow reassignment of the officer to
  ARPC on the established 6 month EDCSA date.
  6.7.3. USAFR officers selected for PV promotion may pin on while mobilized under Title 10 USC
  12302 when the mobilized officer’s Senior Rater submits a signed letter to ARPC/DPBA stating the
  officer is “in the reserve position”. The promotion effective date can be no earlier than 2 business days
  after receipt of the letter by ARPC; or the date the officer meets the Time In Grade requirements in
  Table 2.1. of this AFI whichever is later; or the officer is demobilized from Title 10 USC 12302. The
  promotion effective date in this case will be the day after demobilization or the date the officer meets
  the Time In Grade requirements in Table 2.1. of this AFI whichever is later.

                                                 Chapter 7

                                     PROPRIETY OF PROMOTION

7.1. What is a Propriety of Promotion Action. A propriety of promotion action is a delay in an
officer’s date of promotion, a removal of an officer’s name from a promotion list, or information pre-
sented to the SAF or a selection board that shows an officer may not be qualified for promotion.

7.2. When to Initiate. Commanders initiate a propriety of promotion action when there is cause to
believe that the officer is not mentally, physically, morally or professionally qualified to perform the
duties of the higher grade. Early identification of the officer and proper documentation is essential. For-
mal rules of evidence do not apply to a promotion propriety action. Process promotion propriety actions
on individuals selected for general officer grades according to AFI 36-2501, Chapter 12.

7.3. Who Initiates a Propriety of Promotion Action. An officer's wing commander or equivalent ini-
tiates a promotion propriety action. See sample notification letters at Attachment 11, Attachment 12, or
Attachment 13. The MAJCOM commander reviews propriety actions as outlined in Table 7.1. For
IMAs, promotion propriety actions normally will be initiated by the command to which the officer is
assigned. For IMAs in programs centrally managed at HQ ARPC (HC, JA, SG), promotion propriety
actions will be initiated by the command to which the officer is attached.

7.4. How to Initiate a Promotion Propriety Action. The commander informs the officer of the recom-
mendation, either verbally or in writing, before the effective date of promotion. See processing guidelines
in Table 7.1.
     7.4.1. A propriety action must contain a clear statement of the reasons for the action and evidence
     documenting the reasons.
     7.4.2. The officer must acknowledge receipt and understanding within a reasonable time (Table 7.1.,
     Note 3). Officers may submit statements in their own behalf, including supporting documents. An
     officer who chooses not to submit a statement must include a statement to that effect with receipt
     acknowledgment.
     7.4.3. Whenever possible, initiate promotion propriety actions by giving written notice to the officer.
     If it is not possible to give timely written notice, the initiating commander gives verbal notice person-
     ally or, if necessary, through a designated officer. Follow verbal notice by written notice as soon as
     possible. Once initiated, the recommendation to find an officer in the grade of second lieutenant not
     qualified for promotion (NQP) or remove an officer from a promotion list automatically delays the
     promotion.
     7.4.4. Build the case logically before presenting the case file to the appropriate office (Table 7.1.,
     Note 5). Put information in chronological order. Include required documents. The case file should
     contain original documents. If necessary, reproduced copies are acceptable but must be legible. Use
     readable, reproduced copies and retyped documents (certified as true copies). Include a detailed case
     synopsis, suitable for review by the appropriate approval authority or the promotion board, which ref-
     erences pertinent and tabbed documents, statements, or other significant matters.
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                                 37


   7.4.5. Give the officer the opportunity to comment on all derogatory information added after the
   officer first reviews and acknowledges the initial recommendation, unless the information originated
   solely from the officer's personnel record.

7.5. Involuntary Delay. A commander has the option to delay the promotion of any officer the com-
mander cause to believe that the officer is not mentally, physically, morally or professionally qualified to
perform the duties of the grade to which selected. A delay also occurs if an action begins to remove an
officer from a promotion list. The MAJCOM/FOA commander is the approval authority for delaying a
promotion up to 6 months from the DOR. After 6 months, the SAF must approve a delay action up to 12
additional months.
   7.5.1. Reasons for involuntary delay actions are:
       7.5.1.1. An officer, exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over an officer on the Select List,
       receives sworn charges against the officer.
       7.5.1.2. Court martial charges are preferred against an officer on the Select List.
       7.5.1.3. An investigation is being conducted to determine whether to bring disciplinary action of
       any kind against the officer.
       7.5.1.4. The convening of a board to consider officers for selective early removal (Title 10 U.S.C.,
       Section 14903).
       7.5.1.5. A criminal proceeding in a federal or state court is pending against the officer.
       7.5.1.6. Strength in grade limitations imposed by law. See paragraph 8.7. for further information.
   7.5.2. Delaying a Promotion. Commanders must not use promotion delays as punishment. Delay an
   officer’s promotion at any time before the DOR, if any of the reasons in the paragraph above apply.
       7.5.2.1. Extension of the delay period is automatic upon initiation of a recommendation to find the
       officer Not Qualified for Promotion (NQP) to first lieutenant or to remove an officer from the list.
       Process a recommendation to extend a delay in the same manner as the original, except SAF must
       approve the extension of delay. The recommendation should arrive at HQ USAF/REPX (for staff-
       ing to SAF) no later than 45 days before expiration of the current delay.
       7.5.2.2. If the reason for delay no longer exists, promote the officer to the next higher grade with
       the same DOR as if the delay did not occur. Any commander in the officer’s rating chain may
       determine the reason for delay no longer exists. Table 7.1., step 12 specifies the appropriate pro-
       cess for notifying the member and disposing of the case file.
       7.5.2.3. .If the SAF determines the officer unqualified for promotion during any of the delay time,
       the SAF may direct adjustment of the DOR and position on the RASL to reflect the unqualified
       time. See paragraph 7.5.4.
   7.5.3. Notifying the Officer. In order to delay a promotion under this paragraph, notify the officer in
   writing (Attachment 11), of the grounds for the delay.
       7.5.3.1. Give the written notice to the officer before the DOR. If not practical to give the officer
       written notice before DOR, give verbal notice and follow up with written notice as soon as practi-
       cal.
38                                                                         AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003


        7.5.3.2. If it is not possible for the commander or a representative of the commander to deliver the
        written notice to the officer in person, mail it to the officer by certified mail, return receipt
        requested.
        7.5.3.3. The officer may make a written statement to the approval authority in response to the
        action. The approval authority will consider any statement made by the officer.
     7.5.4. Maximum Length of Delay. Do not delay the promotion to the higher grade more than 6
     months after the date the officer would have been promoted, unless the SAF specifies a longer time.
     Do not delay a promotion more than 18 months after the date the officer would have been promoted,
     except as stated below.
        7.5.4.1. 1.90 days after final action taken in any criminal case against an officer in federal or state
        court
        7.5.4.2. 2.90 days after final action taken in any court-martial case against the officer.
     7.5.5. Adjusting DOR. If the SAF determines the officer is unqualified for promotion during any part
     of a delay, the officer’s DOR, and position on the RASL are adjusted to reflect the unqualified time.
     The amount of unqualified time is added to the projected DOR. This action then adjusts the officer’s
     position on the RASL.
EXAMPLE 1. Based on selection by a promotion board, an officer’s projected DOR is 1 June 1998. The
commander begins a delay action on 6 May 1998. The SAF finds the officer not qualified from 15 May
through 17 July (2 months and 3 days). When the delay ends on 2 November 1998, adjust the officer’s
DOR to 4 August 1998, to reflect the 2 months and 3 days of not qualified time.
EXAMPLE 2. A second lieutenant’s projected DOR to first lieutenant is 30 October 1996. The officer
becomes not qualified for promotion on 17 August 1996, and this lasts until 1 December 1996. The
officer’s new DOR to first lieutenant is 15 February 1997, reflecting the 3 months 15 days of not qualified
time.

7.6. Recommending a Second Lieutenant Not Qualified for Promotion (NQP). Table 7.1., Column
D specifies the processing steps. When the preponderance of the evidence shows an officer not qualified
to perform the duties of the higher grade, the commander recommends in writing that the SAF find him or
her NQP.
     7.6.1. The commander informs the officer of the NQP recommendation, either verbally or in writing,
     before the date of rank. The notification must state if it is necessary for special processing under AFI
     31-501, Personnel Security Program Management (concerning sensitive compartment information
     [SCI] access).
     7.6.2. If involuntary separation or court-martial is pending, the NQP action must be flagged to permit
     SAF to hold in abeyance the NQP decision, pending resolution of the other action. This will avoid
     automatic discharge of the officer. If the other action does not result in separation, the NQP action will
     be processed to completion.
     7.6.3. Commanders should give officers a reasonable opportunity to overcome the basis for their
     non-qualification before taking separation action. Retain a second lieutenant found NQP in current
     assignment for 6 months, starting on the date the promotion would have occurred, unless retention is
     inconsistent with good order and discipline.
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                                  39


   7.6.4. If the commander determines the officer is NQP by the end of the 6 month period and does not
   wish to retain the officer further, separate the officer according to AFI 36-3209, Separation Proce-
   dures for Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve Members.
   7.6.5. The commander can request SAF approval to retain the officer beyond 6 months for additional
   observation. Initiate request to arrive at HQ USAF/REPX (for staffing to SAF) no later than 45 days
   before expiration of the initial 6 month period. SAF can retain the officer for up to 18 months from the
   date the promotion would have occurred.
   7.6.6. If during the retention period, the commander determines the officer is qualified for promotion,
   then promote the officer upon MAJCOM commander approval. The promotion is effective upon
   meeting time-in-grade requirements or the date the MAJCOM commander determined the officer
   fully qualified for promotion, whichever is later.
   7.6.7. If at the end of the retention period, the commander determines the officer remains NQP, the
   commander must separate the officer. The separation must occur within 18 months of the date the pro-
   motion would have occurred. The commander informs the officer of the separation and advises the
   officer of the rationale supporting the belief, in writing, and that he or she is subject to immediate sep-
   aration, as determined by the SAF.

7.7. Recommending an Officer Above the Grade of Second Lieutenant NQP. I f a c o m m a n d e r
believes an officer is NQP, the commander should make that recommendation (Attachment 12). Table
7.1., Columns D and E, specify the processing steps. HQ ARPC/DPJ presents cases of this kind to the pro-
motion board for all officers meeting a promotion board.
   7.7.1. The MAJCOM commander (Adjutant General for ANGUS officers) makes the final recom-
   mendation to the selection board to find the officer not qualified for promotion. The case file must
   arrive at the selection board for consideration before the board finishes scoring the officer’s competi-
   tive category. Such a recommendation does not itself make the officer ineligible for consideration.
   7.7.2. HQ ARPC/DPJ gives the correspondence to the board to evaluate the officer's selection folder.
   The recommendation stays in effect until the board adjourns.
   7.7.3. The promotion board decides if the officer is qualified for promotion.

7.8. Removing an Officer from a Recommended List. Table 7.1., Column F, specifies the processing
steps.
   7.8.1. President. The President may remove the name of any officer from a promotion list at any time
   before the date on which the officer is promoted.
   7.8.2. Withholding of Senate Confirmation. If the Senate does not give its advice and consent for
   appointment to the grade of colonel or above, the name of that officer is removed from the list.
   7.8.3. To start the process, the commander informs the officer (verbally or in writing) of the pending
   removal from the recommended list. The commander must provide written notice if initial notification
   was verbal (Attachment 13). The officer must receive notice of the pending removal before the DOR.
   7.8.4. A commander's recommendation to remove an officer automatically delays the promotion until
   the SAF makes a decision on that recommendation and either returns the package or forwards it to the
   President.
40                                                                        AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003


     7.8.5. A promotion selection board reconsiders an eligible officer if the officer was selected the first
     time but was subsequently removed from the list.
     7.8.6. Continued Eligibility. An officer removed from the list by either the President or the Senate
     continues to be eligible for promotion. If considered, selected and promoted by a later board, the
     officer’s DOR is normally established as if selected by the second board, unless the SAF grants the
     officer the same DOR as if selected by the first board.
     7.8.7. Promotion Removal time Standards. Removal actions will be processed as expeditiously as
     possible. the total period of time that an officer's promotion is delayed pending decision on removal,
     including any prior period period of delay under paragraph 7.5., should not exceed 18 months, exclud-
     ing any period of delay attributable to the officer.

NOTES:
1. For any IMA performing duty at a unit of attachment, that commander may initiate a propriety action
and notify the officer of that action. The propriety action must then proceed to the unit of assignment for
processing.
2. Contact the local DP and JA. For IMAs, the commander should use the active duty MPF and legal
offices at the base of assignment or attachment.
3. The officer must acknowledge receipt and may submit a defending statement within a reasonable
period from the date of the commander’s memorandum (5 working days for AGR officers or full-time
ANGUS or USAFR (ART) officers, and 20 calendar days for other ANGUS or USAFR officers). When
an officer, other than an AGR or full-time ANGUS/USAFR officer, has a pending propriety of promotion
action and does not acknowledge receipt of written notification, the commander’s memorandum stating
that personal delivery to the officer was made, or the postal receipt showing proof of mailing, or the
returned postal receipt indicating delivery will suffice as acknowledgment. Officers may apply for an
extension of the response time to the initiating commander.
4. For actions under this column:
       For all USAFR officers (including AGRs), send the case file to HQ ARPC/DPJ.
       For all ANGUS officers (including AGRs), send the files to ANG/DP. ANG/DP sends the case
       file to HQ ARPC/DPJ.

5. Do not use zip codes in electronically transmitted messages. Forward correspondence as follows:
       USAFR IMAs, participating IRR and S7 members: HQ ARPC/DPJ.
       AFRC unit assigned and USAFR AGRs: HQ AFRC/DP.
       ANG (not AGRs): ANG/DP.
       ANGUS AGRs: ANG/SM.
6. HQ ARPC/DPJ updates the Headquarters Air Force (HAF) Master Personnel File (MPF) for other than
USAFR AGRs. HQ AFRC/DPM updates the HAF MPF for USAFR AGRs. ANG/DP updates HAF
MPF for ANGUS officers.
7. The servicing MPF of the immediate commander. For IMAs, this office may be the active duty MPF.
8. If an officer is reassigned, the originating MPF sends the complete case to the gaining MPF or HQ
ARPC/DPJ. Send an information copy to the gaining MAJCOM and HQ ARPC/DPJ, or ANG/DP when
an officer is scheduled for reassignment.
9. This step applies only to delay actions requiring SAF approval that exceeded 6 months after the
officer’s DOR.
10. Provide the original and one copy of all case files pertaining to a recommendation to delay a promo-
tion, find an officer not qualified for promotion to first lieutenant, or remove an officer from a promotion
list for which the SAF is the approval authority to the appropriate office.

                                                Chapter 8

                 VOLUNTARY DELAY AND DECLINATION OF PROMOTION

8.1. Purpose. Due to circumstances beyond an officer’s control, the officer may be unable to accept pro-
motion. An officer may apply for a voluntarily delay of promotion. For USAFR personnel, the approval
authority for voluntary delays is HQ USAF/RE. This authority is hereby delegated to AFRC/CV (unit per-
sonnel) and HQ USAF/RE (MA) (IMA personnel). The approval authority for ANGUS personnel is
NGB/CF, who hereby delegates it to The Adjutants General. The authority may not be redelegated. The
officer shall be considered to have accepted the promotion on the date the promotion is made unless the
officer expressly declines the promotion or is granted a delay of promotion.

8.2. Making Application for Delay. An officer must apply for voluntary delay of promotion before a
delay may be approved. The application must be approved through the appropriate channels before the
DOR. Officers apply by submitting AF Form 3988, Application for Voluntary Delay, Acceptance, or
Declination of Promotion (in three copies) to unit commanders. All applications must arrive at HQ
ARPC/DPJ at least 30 days before DOR (or within 15 days of public release of the results, if DOR is on
public release).
   8.2.1. For USAFR unit assigned officers, the senior rater will forward, through appropriate command
   channels to HQ AFRC/DPMO, the original copy for processing to AFRC/CV for approval. HQ
   AFRC/DPMO will send approved forms to HQ ARPC/DPJA, for filing in the master personnel record
   group. The MPF will maintain a copy for the UPRG and provide the officer one copy.
   8.2.2. For USAFR IMAs, the supervisor will forward the original copy through the Program Manager
   to HQ ARPC/CC. HQ ARPC/CC will endorse the application (if HQ ARPC/CC concurs) and forward
   it to HQ USAF/RE for approval. Send approved forms to HQ ARPC/DPJA, for filing in the master
   personnel record group. The MPF will maintain a copy for the UPRG and provide the officer one
   copy.
   8.2.3. For ANGUS officers, the unit commander will forward the original form through command
   channels to the state Adjutant General for approval. Send the approved form to ANG/DP to update
   PDS and forwarding to HQ ARPC/DPJ. Maintain a copy for the UPRG and provide the officer one
   copy.
   8.2.4. For non-participating officers, submit two copies to HQ ARPC/DPJ for processing.

8.3. Consequences of an Approval of a Delay in Promotion. If approved, the officer’s name remains
on the promotion list during the authorized period of delay (unless removed under another provision of
law). At the end of the delay period, or at anytime during the delay, the officer may accept the promotion.
If the officer wants to accept the promotion before the end of the delay period, an AF Form 3988 indicat-
ing acceptance must arrive as stated below, within 5 days of acceptance of the promotion. The effective
date is the date the officer accepts the voluntarily delayed promotion (Table 5.2., Rule 10).
   8.3.1. ANGUS. Submit AF Form 3988 (in three copies) to unit commander. The unit commander will
   forward the form to the State Adjutant General who will forward it to ANG/DP, for publication of
   promotion orders (with copy to HQ ARPC/DPJA).
52                                                                       AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003


     8.3.2. USAFR. Submit AF Form 3988 (in three copies) through the unit commander to the senior
     rater. When the senior rater endorses the form, the unit commander will forward it to HQ ARPC/
     DPJA (with copy to HQ AFRC/DPMO [unit assigned] or HQ ARPC/CC [IMAs]), for orders publica-
     tion.

8.4. Consequences of Disapproval of a Delay in Promotion. If the application for delay is disap-
proved, the officer must either accept the promotion or decline the promotion. The denial of a request for
a delay of promotion is not considered a failure of selection for promotion unless the officer declines to
accept the promotion following the denial of the request for delay. See paragraph 8.9. for the effects of
declination of a promotion.

8.5. Length of Delay. An officer may request a voluntary delay, in 1 year increments, for up to 3 years
from the officer’s original DOR. The appropriate approval authority may approve a period of delay less
than the 1 year requested. If granted less than a 1 year delay, the applicant must reapply if a longer delay
is needed. Each 1 year delay requires separate application and approval. Application must include imme-
diate commander’s plan to utilize the officer in a future higher graded position(s).

8.6. End of Delay Period. At the end of the delay period, the officer must either accept or decline the
promotion. The promotion will automatically occur at the end of the approved delay period if the officer
takes no action.

8.7. Delay for Limitations in Officer Strength In Grade (AGR). Promotion of an officer on the
RASL, serving on active duty, to a grade with strength limitations set by Title 10 U.S.C., Section 10211
and 12310, can be delayed to ensure compliance with those strength limitations. The delay expires when
the strength-in-grade limitations no longer apply. The grade of the position determines whether a selected
officer can accept the promotion at DOR. If the grade of the position does not support the higher grade,
the DOR is delayed until the officer obtains a position to support the higher grade, or the officer completes
the tour. If the officer wants to decline the promotion, the commander submits the original AF Form 3988
to HQ ARPC/DPJ (for inclusion in the Master Personnel Record) through HQ USAF/REPS and HQ
AFRC/DP.
     8.7.1. When the promotion becomes effective, the DOR and position on the RASL of these officers
     remains the same, as if there had not been a delay.
     8.7.2. An officer with a delayed promotion under this paragraph may request release from active duty.
     If granted, when the promotion becomes effective, the DOR and position on the RASL of these offic-
     ers remains same, as if there had not been a delay.

8.8. Declination. An officer selected for promotion is considered to have accepted the promotion on the
DOR unless the officer expressly declines the promotion. An officer must submit a declination statement
no later than 2400 hours on the day before the DOR for mandatory promotions. For officers whose DOR
is the public release date, and all USAFR PV selectees, the officer must decline no later than 15 calendar
days after public release.
     8.8.1. USAFR officers (other than Active Guard Reserve [AGR]) sign the original and one copy of
     AF Form 3988 and forward through their commander to the servicing MPF. The officer may decline
     the promotion with a written statement clearly indicating the officer is declining the promotion. The
     written statement must be signed, dated, and the officer’s SSN clearly written on the statement. The
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                          53


   MPF sends the original to HQ ARPC/DPJA. The MPF files a copy in the officer's unit personnel
   record group (UPRG).
   8.8.2. ANGUS officers (other than AGRs) sign the original and one copy of AF Form 3988 and for-
   ward them through their commander to the servicing MPF. The servicing MPF sends a copy of the
   declination statement through state headquarters to ANG/DP and to HQ ARPC/DPJA.
   8.8.3. AGRs sign and send an original and three copies of the appropriate declination statement
   (either an AF Form 3988 or a letter) through the commander to the MPF. The MPF files the declina-
   tion statement in the officer's UPRG. The MPF then sends the original to HQ USAF/REPS and HQ
   ARPC/DPMO (USAFR) or a copy to the state headquarters and a copy to ANG/DP (ANGUS). A
   copy is sent to HQ ARPC/DPJA.

8.9. Effect of Declining a Promotion. Declining a promotion causes the removal of an officer’s name
from the promotion list and, if serving in a grade below colonel, the officer is considered a deferred
officer.
54                                                                       AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003


                                                 Chapter 9

                                SPECIAL SELECTION BOARDS (SSB)

9.1. Holding SSBs. HQ ARPC/DPJ conducts promotion SSBs to consider officers who did not meet a
board or who were improperly considered by one or more promotion boards. SSBs replicate promotion
boards, including pre- and post-board procedures and policies as outlined in Chapter 1, Chapter 3,
Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of this instruction, to the maximum extent possible. Exception: Panel members
must be at least a colonel and the board president must be at least a brigadier general.

9.2. Granting SSB Consideration. Air Force Board for Correction of Military Records (AFBCMR) or a
federal court can direct an officer for consideration by an SSB. The HQ ARPC Director of Personnel Pro-
gram Management (HQ ARPC/DP) can approve an eligible officer for consideration by an SSB based on
the conditions below.
     9.2.1. Grant SSBs, based on an administrative error, a legal or material error, or based on a formal
     appeal. SSBs consider officers for promotion to the grades of captain through colonel.
     9.2.2. Administrative Error. An administrative error occurs when an eligible officer did not meet a
     board. If this occurs, the officer can meet the next promotion board convened that will consider the
     officer’s grade and competitive category.
     9.2.3. Legal or Material Error. HQ ARPC/DPJ can direct an SSB for a nonselected officer, if the SAF,
     or a person acting on behalf of the SAF, determines:
        9.2.3.1. The action of the board that considered the officer was contrary to law or involved mate-
        rial error of fact or material administrative error; or
        9.2.3.2. The board did not consider material information that should have been available in com-
        pliance with pertinent Air Force directives and policies. Do not have an SSB if, by exercising rea-
        sonable diligence, the officer should have discovered the error or omission and could have taken
        corrective action before the originally scheduled board convened.
     9.2.4. Pursuant to Formal Appeal. The AFBCMR may grant SSBs when it determines an officer's
     nonselection for promotion resulted from an error or injustice in the officer's record. Barring extenu-
     ating circumstances, the SSB will convene and the officer informed of the results within 180 days of
     the finding of an error by the AFBCMR.

9.3. Application for SSB. Officers submit applications for SSBs using DD Form 149, Application for
Correction of Military Record Under the Provisions of Title 10, US Code, Section 1552, or AF Form 948,
Application for Correction/Removal of Evaluation Report.

9.4. SSB Procedures. SSB members consist of officers who meet qualifications outlined in paragraph
1.9., and who are diverse representations of officers corresponding to the officers under consideration by
the SSB.
     9.4.1. Reconstruct the records of officers under consideration, as they would have appeared to the
     original board had the officers been properly considered. Compare the officers' records with bench-
     mark records from the original board.
     9.4.2. Use the scoring procedures outlined in paragraphs 4.8. and 4.9.
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                                55


   9.4.3. Select an officer if the SSB finds him or her fully qualified for promotion and the record:
       9.4.3.1. Scores higher than all the nonselect records and
       9.4.3.2. Ties at least one of the selected records from the original board.
   9.4.4. Identify any officer considered by the board whose record indicates the officer should "show
   cause" for his or her retention on the RASL. The majority opinion of the members of the board will
   identify these officers.
   9.4.5. Provide a report according to paragraph 4.17.

9.5. Writing Letters to SSBs. An officer may write a letter to the SSB according to paragraph 4.7. The
letter must contain only information available to the original board. Mail the letter to the HQ ARPC/
DPJA. Letters should arrive at least 30 days before the board convenes. Letters must arrive no later than
0800 the day the board convenes for consideration by the board.
   9.5.1. Individuals meeting more than one SSB prepare and mail a separate letter to each board.
   9.5.2. Address letters to FY (insert the appropriate year and grade), HQ ARPC/DPJA. To preserve
   anonymity, do not date the letter and do not address letter to the Special Selection Board.

9.6. Results of SSB.
   9.6.1. Administrative Error. If the SSB conducted for administrative error does not recommend an
   officer (or former officer) for promotion to a grade below colonel, the officer is a deferred officer.
   9.6.2. Material or Legal Error. If the SSB conducted for material error does not recommend the
   officer (or former officer) for promotion to a grade below colonel, the nonselection constitutes a
   deferral by the original board. The officer does not receive an additional deferral for the nonselection
   by the SSB.

9.7. Promoting Officers Recommended by SSB. Promote officers upon Presidential approval and Sen-
ate confirmation (if required). Promote the officer with the date of rank he or she would have received if
considered and selected by the original board. The member, based on his or her retroactive promotion by
SSB, may be eligible for further consideration by selection boards, provided he or she meets the eligibility
criteria.

9.8. Disclosing SSB Proceedings. Release of information is the same as mandatory promotion boards.

9.9. Special Review Boards (SRB). Special Review Boards consider officers who, at the time of their
original consideration, had an error in their selection record that met a board. SRBs are used for promo-
tion boards held before 1 October 1996. An SRB will convene at HQ ARPC in conjunction with a regu-
larly scheduled promotion board. Only the Air Force Board for the Correction of Military Records
(AFBCMR) can direct this board. The SRB will forward their recommendations to the AFBCMR for final
deliberations. The AFBCMR will then notify the officer of the results of the SRB.

                                      CONTINUATION BOARDS

10.1. Purpose. The purpose of continuation boards is to retain in an active status, officers who would
otherwise be required to separate due to twice failing promotion to the next higher grade or reaching their
maximum time in service (lieutenant colonel and colonel only). Individual application will not be
accepted for continuation until HQ USAF/RE determines a need for specific grades of skills exists within
the entire USAFR. If a need exists, HQ USAF/RE will request SAF authorize conducting a continuation
board. When the SAF determines there is a need to retain additional officers in specific grades and com-
petitive categories, officers meeting one of the above requirements may be invited to apply for continua-
tion consideration.

10.2. Responsibilities.
     10.2.1. SAF Responsibilities. SAF determines when to hold a continuation board based on Air Force
     requirements. SAF will establish continuation quotas, establish the length of continuation, approve
     applications for termination of continued officers (prior to expiration of term), and approve continua-
     tion propriety actions and board reports.
     10.2.2. Competitive Category Corps Chiefs and Line of the Air Force (LAF) Functional Managers
     Responsibilities. Submit requests to ANG/DP (ANGUS) or HQ USAF/REP (USAFR) if continuation
     is desired based on "critical skill needs" prior to SAF approval to hold a continuation board.
     10.2.3. ANG/DP and HQ USAF/REP Responsibilities.
        10.2.3.1. Receive justified service need applications from BSC, MSC, NC, MC/DC, HC, JA func-
        tional chiefs, and LAF functional managers prior to processing any requests to HQ USAF/RE or
        NGB/CF for continuation boards.
        10.2.3.2. Recommend to SAF quotas and length of continuation for each competitive category
        based on Air Force requirements and recommendations from competitive category corps chiefs
        and LAF functional managers.
     10.2.4. HQ USAF/REPS Responsibilities. Endorses requests for continuation of colonels beyond
     their mandatory retirement due to years of service.
     10.2.5. HQ ARPC/DPJ Responsibilities. Conducts continuation boards and processes board reports to
     SAF for approval. Processes officers for continuation and performs the following actions.
        10.2.5.1. Flows post-board transactions to update PDS to reflect the results of the continuation
        board.
        10.2.5.2. Establishes public release date and notifies MPFs when to release the results. NOTE:
        When held in conjunction with the member’s promotion selection board, the release of continua-
        tion results will be concurrent with release of promotion results.
        10.2.5.3. Notifies nonparticipating officers of their continuation status (Attachment 14).
     10.2.6. MPF Responsibilities. Prepare the continuation acceptance or declination statement to accom-
     pany the letter that notifies the officer of continuation (sample at Attachment 14).
        10.2.6.1. Ensures commanders notify selected officers of continuation upon public release.
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                                 57


       10.2.6.2. Ensures officers sign continuation statements within 60 calendar days from public
       release date.
       10.2.6.3. Forwards a copy of the letter to MPF Relocations.
       10.2.6.4. Annotates circumstances if an individual is unable or unwilling to sign the acceptance or
       declination statement.
       10.2.6.5. Sends the original statement to HQ ARPC/ DPAD with a copy to HQ AFRC/DPM (for
       unit, AGR).
   10.2.7. HQ ARPC/DPAD Responsibilities. HQ ARPC/DPAD takes the following actions for officers
   selected for continuation by a continuation board.
       10.2.7.1. Updates the officer's MSD to reflect the length of continuation approved by SAF.
       10.2.7.2. Updates acceptance or declination of continuation status in PDS. Sends the original doc-
       ument for filing in the Master Personnel Records Group.
       10.2.7.3. If the officer declines continuation status, processes the officer according to procedures
       established for twice deferred officers, or for officers required to separate for years of service, as
       appropriate.

10.3. Consideration for Continuation.
   10.3.1. Once SAF determines a service need exists, an officer, required to be removed from the RASL
   due to twice failing of selection for promotion (current grade of captain and major), or for years of ser-
   vice (current grade of lieutenant colonel and colonel), may be considered for continuation status on
   the RASL. HQ ARPC/DPJ will notify officers eligible to apply for consideration by a continuation
   board.
   10.3.2. Recommending Officers Not Qualified For Continuation. A commander will submit a not
   qualified recommendation as soon as the commander deems an officer is not qualified for continua-
   tion.
       10.3.2.1. The commander will complete the recommendation before the selection board con-
       venes.
       10.3.2.2. The commander must notify the officer of the recommendation and forward the package
       through command channels. Any commander may disapprove the recommendation. The MAJ-
       COM commander signs it indicating approval and sends the package to HQ ARPC/DPJA for file
       in the officer's selection folder. If the MAJCOM commander disapproves the recommendation,
       the MAJCOM commander returns it to the servicing MPF. The MPF advises the initiating com-
       mander of the decision.

10.4. Effects of Continuation. Normally, a selection board will consider officers for continuation in
conjunction with the promotion board that nonselects officers for promotion the second time. NOTE:
Depending on Air Force requirements, stand alone continuation boards may be held to continue officers
past their mandatory separation date.
   10.4.1. Effects of Selection for Continuation. If selected for continuation, the officer shall be retained
   on the RASL. The officer remains eligible for APZ promotion consideration, while in a continued sta-
   tus, provided the officer remains otherwise eligible.
58                                                                        AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003


     10.4.2. Effects of Nonselection for Continuation. If not selected for continuation, the officer shall be
     removed from the RASL for twice failure of promotion or for mandatory time in service requirements,
     as appropriate.
     10.4.3. Notifying Officers of Selection or Nonselection for Continuation. Commanders have the
     responsibility to notify officers of selection or nonselection for continuation. The commander shall
     advise them to return acceptance statement or declination to the MPF

10.5. Initiating Removal from a Continuation List. If the commander believes continuation is not
appropriate, he or she recommends the officer be removed from the continuation list. The commander
notifies the officer of the recommendation, verbally or in writing, before the officer accepts continuation
or prior to the 60-day suspense. The commander will advise the officer not to accept continuation until the
SAF makes a final decision. NOTE: Do not initiate removal from a continuation list once the officer
accepts continuation.
     10.5.1. The commander forwards the recommendation to the servicing MPF who forwards the
     request through command channels to HQ ARPC/DPJA. HQ ARPC/DPJA sends the package to SAF
     for final decision.
     10.5.2. The SAF approves or disapproves the action.
     10.5.3. HQ ARPC/DPJA notifies the commander and HQ ARPC/DPAD (separations) of SAF deci-
     sion to remove the officer from the nomination list. HQ ARPC/DPAD separates the officer not later
     than the last day of the 6th month after President approves the nomination list.
     10.5.4. If the SAF disapproves the removal from the continuation list, notify the officer of his or her
     continued status. The officer has 10 days from notification to accept or decline continuation on the
     RASL. If the officer does not respond, or does not accept continuation, HQ ARPC/DPAD separates
     the officer not later than the 15th day after notification date.

10.6. Completion of Continued Status. Continuation status may not exceed the last day of the month in
which the officer completes the commissioned service shown in Table 10.1. An officer must accept or
decline continuation status if offered (see Attachment 14).
     10.6.1. An officer’s continuation status will terminate when removed from the RASL, if selected for
     promotion to a higher grade, or when terminated by the SAF due to a change in the “critical skill
     needs” of the Air Force.
     10.6.2. If the officer declines to accept continuation on the RASL, the officer will separate as if not
     considered or selected for continuation on the RASL.

                            SELECTIVE EARLY REMOVAL BOARDS

11.1. Purpose. If the SAF determines there are too many officers in any grade and competitive category
with at least 30 years of commissioned service or 20 years of satisfactory federal service for retirement,
the SAF may convene a board for the purpose of recommending officers, by name, for removal from the
RASL.

11.2. Quotas. The SAF will establish a specific number of officers to be selected for early removal. All
officers in the grade and competitive category being considered for early removal from the RASL are eli-
gible for selection.

11.3. Conducting the Board. Conduct Selective Early Removal Boards in the same manner as Selection
Boards. See Chapter 1, Chapter 3, Chapter 4 and Chapter 5.

11.4. Notification of Selection or Nonselection for Selective Early Removal from the RASL. S A F
will provide specific notification guidance for each selective early removal board conducted.

                         PROMOTION TO GENERAL OFFICER GRADES

12.1. Promotion to General Officer Grades in the Air Force Reserve (Not Applicable to ANGUS).
The Secretary of the Air Force holds a Reserve general officer vacancy promotion board each year. The
board consists of at least five general officers who are senior in grade and rank to all officers under con-
sideration. At least half of the board members must be USAFR officers.
   12.1.1. HQ USAF/DP conducts USAFR General Officer Promotion Boards IAW procedures outlined
   in AFI 36-2501, Officer Promotion and Selective Continuation, Part 3. The Chief of Air Force
   Reserve sends AFGOMO the names of all eligible officers. The promotion board evaluates the offic-
   ers and sends SAF the names of officers they consider best qualified and recommended for promotion.
   12.1.2. The President of the United States appoints general officers with the advice and consent of the
   US Senate. Officers not appointed or confirmed may be reassigned as outlined in AFI 36-2115.

12.2. Eligibility for Promotion to General Officer Grades.
   12.2.1. For promotion to brigadier general in the USAFR, an officer must:
       Be a colonel in the Selected Reserve of the Air Force Reserve.
       Complete 2 years as a Reserve of the Air Force colonel.
       Fill an Air Force Reserve general officer position for at least 6 months.
       Be less than 55 years old on the day the board convenes.
       Have at least 50 points accrued during their most recent retention/retirement (R/R) year.
       Have no waivers during 4 of the 5 years before the board convenes, with 2 of those 4 years being
   the two most recent.
       Complete a senior service school.
   12.2.2. For promotion to major general in the USAFR, an officer must:
       Hold an appointment as a brigadier general in the Selected Reserve of the Air Force Reserve.
       Complete 1 year in grade as a Reserve of the Air Force brigadier general.
       Fill a Reserve major general officer position for at least 6 months.
       Be less than 57 years old on the day the board convenes.
       Have at least 50 retirement points accrued during their most recent R/R year.
       Have no waivers during at least 4 of the 5 years before the board convenes, with 2 of those 4 years
   being the two most recent.
   12.2.3. Waivers. Waiver authority for non-statutory eligibility criteria is HQ USAF/DP. Send fully
   justified waiver requests to HQ USAF/RE for review and processing.
62                                                                      AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003


12.3. Ineligibility for Promotion to General Officer in the USAFR. An officer is ineligible for con-
sideration by a Reserve General Officer Selection Board, if, at the time the board convenes, the officer is
on a list of officers selected for promotion by a previous Reserve General Officer Selection Board.

12.4. Promotion Recommendation Requirements. AFI 36-2501, Officer Promotion and Selective
Continuation outlines promotion recommendation requirements for Reserve colonels occupying general
officer positions (AF Form 709) and brigadier generals eligible for promotion (AF Form 78).

12.5. Forms Prescribed. AF Form 3988, Application for Voluntary Delay, Acceptance or Declina-
tion of Promotion

—The terms "recommended", "not recommended", and "deferred" are used in statutes governing officer
promotions. "Selectee", "selected", and "nonselected" commonly refer to officers recommended or not
recommended by a promotion selection board. NOTE: An officer is a selectee or nonselectee when the
board adjourns.

not on the Active Duty List (ADL), and in the order of seniority of the grade in which they are serving.
Officers serving in the same grade are carried in the order of their rank in that grade. The RASL for the
Air Force shall include officers in the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve. Except as otherwise
provided by law, an officer must be on the RASL to be eligible for consideration for selection for
promotion, continuation, or selective early removal as a member of the Reserve of the Air Force.

Special Review Board (SRB)—A board to consider those officers who were eligible for consideration
by a selection board, but because of an error or injustice, were not considered. This procedure is used for
promotions and considerations in question before the enactment of ROPMA (1 October 1996).

                                DETERMINING A VALID VACANCY
Vacancy Determination
    For PV promotion nomination to the grade of captain through lieutenant colonel, the officer must be
otherwise eligible for promotion consideration and must be the incumbent (cannot be an overage) of a
position with an authorized grade higher than the officer’s current grade. A vacancy determination will be
based upon the following criteria: (1) the position vacancy must be within the nominee’s Duty Air Force
Specialty (DAFS - excluding prefix and suffix) in an organization managed by the nominating senior rater
and (2) a position vacancy is defined within the nominee’s DAFS if the number of officers assigned in the
next or higher grades (up to an including lieutenant colonel) is less than the number of officers authorized
in the next or higher grades (up to and including lieutenant colonel). When determining vacancies within
a DAFS, compute authorized and assigned figures separately for each Reserve category (i.e., Air Reserve
Technicians (ARTs), Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs), Active Guard Reserve (AGR), tradi-
tional unit participants, etc.). When computing the number of officers assigned by grade to a particular
DAFS, do not count officers who, within 90 days after the board convening date, are either projected for
reassignment from the senior rater’s organization or have an established date for removal from the
Reserve Active Status List (RASL). If their date of assignment from the senior rater’s organization or
removal from the RASL is projected to be later than 90 days after the board convening date, they must be
counted in determining the number of officers assigned.


An Example
    This scenario assumes that all authorized/assigned are the same Reserve category (traditional unit
reservists), are assigned to an organization managed by Col Smith (the senior rater), are assigned against
DAFS 11A UMD positions, and are not projected for reassignment from the organization or removal from
the RASL within 90 days of board convening date. The numbers shown are purely for illustrative pur-
poses and were chosen to illustrate promoting lower grades against higher graded vacancies.
   Col Smith’s UMD authorizes the number of officers shown, by grade, in DAFS 11A, and he has the

        PV Promotion from First Lieutenant to Captain. In this example, a captain position vacancy
does not exist as the number of assigned captains is equal to or exceeds the number of authorized captains.
If the number of assigned captains had been less than the number authorized, then eligible lieutenants
could be nominated up to the point where, if these lieutenants were selected for promotion, the number of
captains assigned equaled the number of captains authorized. However, 10 U.S.C. allows us to fill a
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                                73


vacancy in any grade with an authorized appointment in any lower grade. With this in mind, we next look
at the majors and find that the summation of captains and majors (21 authorized, 24 assigned) still does
not yield a position vacancy opportunity. Had this example shown less assigned than authorized, then eli-
gible lieutenants could be nominated up to the point where, if selected for promotion to captain, the num-
ber of captains and majors assigned equaled the number of captains and majors authorized. However,
when we bring lieutenant colonels into the mix, a position vacancy now exists as the summation of cap-
tain, major, and lieutenant colonels yields the totals shown above (37 authorized, 36 assigned). Col Smith
can thus use a lieutenant colonel vacancy to nominate one lieutenant for PV promotion to captain. If the
lieutenant is selected, Col Smith will be unable to nominate any more lieutenants for PV promotion as
long as the number of captains assigned is equal to or greater than the number of captains authorized, or
the total captain/major/lieutenant colonel assigned mix is equal to or greater than the total captain/major/
lieutenant colonel authorized mix.
        PV Promotion from Captain to Major. A major position vacancy does not exist as the number
of majors assigned exceeds the number of majors authorized. If the number of assigned majors had been
less than the number authorized, then eligible captains could be nominated up to the point where, if
selected for promotion to major, the number of majors assigned equaled the number of majors authorized.
However, when we bring lieutenant colonels into this mix, we now have 29 majors and lieutenant colo-
nels authorized and 26 assigned. Thus, Col Smith can nominate up to three captains for PV promotion to
major using existing lieutenant colonel vacancies. If all three captains are selected, Col Smith will be
unable to nominate any more captains for PV promotion as long as the number of majors assigned is equal
to or greater than the number of majors authorized, or the total major/lieutenant colonel assigned mix is
equal to or greater than the total major/lieutenant colonel authorized mix.
        PV Promotion from Major to Lieutenant Colonel. As there are four less lieutenant colonels
assigned than are authorized, Col Smith may nominate up to four majors for PV promotion to lieutenant
colonel. Had the number of lieutenant colonels assigned been equal to or exceeded the number authorized,
Col Smith would be unable to nominate any majors for PV promotion to lieutenant colonel. Additionally,
if Col Smith nominates four majors and they are all selected, he will be unable to nominate any more
majors for PV as long as the number of lieutenant colonels assigned is equal to or greater than the number
authorized.
        Note that when determining if a valid vacancy exists, you first look at authorized/assigned in the
grade you wish to promote to. You only bring the higher grades into the vacancy determination mix if the
number assigned in the grade you wish to promote to is equal to or greater than the number authorized.
Although this process is somewhat cumbersome, it allows us the potential to promote more officers via
PV as well as the potential to continue promoting the more junior grades despite overgrades and overages.
In the above scenario, we can promote up to 8 officers (one lieutenant, three captains, and four majors)
using the four lieutenant colonel vacancies. Had we only looked at the grade we wished to promote to, we
could only promote 4 officers via PV (no lieutenants or captains and 4 majors).
        Keep in mind that the above scenario is a snapshot used to compute a position vacancy at a given
point in time. The DAFS authorized/assigned are dynamic variables that will constantly change due to
accessions, separations, reassignments, promotions into (lieutenant to captain) or out of (lieutenant colo-
nel to colonel) the DAFS mix, UMD changes, etc.

Dear __________
  It is my pleasure to inform you of your promotion to the grade of (appropriate grade), United States Air
Force Reserve. This promotion attests to your ability, performance, and future potential in the Air Force
Reserve.
  A program exists for notifying civilian companies of a promotion of one of their employees, who is also
an officer in the Air Force Reserve. In this way, you are given recognition for your achievements as a
reservist. At the same time, it encourages civilian industries to support the Reserve program. If you wish
to have your employer notified of your Air Force Reserve promotion, please send me a letter of permis-
sion and include your employer’s name and address. If the letter should be addressed to a particular per-
son, please include that person’s name and title.
   For your promotion to be effective you must remain on the Reserve Active Status List, or in case of
transfer, on the Active Duty List until the effective date of promotion.
  As a reminder, to retire at the higher grade, there is a requirement that you serve satisfactorily for 6
months at the higher grade (grades of major and below) or 3 years (grades of lieutenant colonel and
above).
  Congratulations on your promotion. I hope you will continue to participate in the Reserve program and
wish you success in your future endeavors.

        EFFECTS OF NONSELECTION FOR PROMOTION TO CAPTAIN OR MAJOR
Title 10, United States Code, covers administration of the Reserve of the Air Force including promotion
and discharge or retirement. The following summarizes the provisions of law with specific sections noted
in parentheses:

Officers who have failed of selection for promotion by their first mandatory board will be considered by
the next mandatory board considering officers of their grade, providing they remain on the Reserve
Active Status List (Sections 14101 & 14501). As with the first board, officer may send a letter to the pro-
motion board (Section 14106). If selected by the second board, the officer will be promoted in order of
seniority after those previously selected have been promoted (Section 14308).

If not recommended by the second board, the officer will be discharged, retired, or retained temporarily as
required by law. All officers are required to serve a prescribed minimum number of years of military ser-
vice (Section 651). Officers who have not completed the required service may not be discharged until
completion of the required service (Section 12645). Officers who have completed the required minimum
service but have less than 18 years or more than 20 years of creditable service for retirement will be dis-
charged or retired. The date of discharge/retirement will be the first day of the seventh month after the
month the board list is approved by the President (Section 14504 or 14505).

Officers who have completed at least 18 years but less than 19 years of creditable service for retirement
will be retained until completion of 20 years of satisfactory service or for 3 years after the required dis-
charge date, whichever comes first (Section 12646). Officers with more than 19 years but less than 20
years of creditable service for retirement, will be retained until completion of 20 years of satisfactory ser-
vice or 2 years after the required discharge date, whichever comes first (Section 12646).

Dear __________

You have been selected for continuation on the Reserve Active Status List. You will remain in this status
unless sooner relieved by the Secretary of the Air Force.

While in continuation status, you will be considered Above-the-Promotion-Zone by future promotion
boards if you remain otherwise eligible.

Continuation will not guarantee qualification for retired pay. Your adjusted separation date is based on
years of commissioned service, not satisfactory service for retirement. Contact the office below at
1-800-525-0102 ext 401 for your specific separation date.

You must accept or decline this status within 60 days of public release of the Continuation Board results.
If you decline continuation status, you will be retired, if you qualify and apply for retirement, or dis-
charged.

Please indicate your choice by endorsing this letter and returning it to:
       HQ ARPC/DPAD
       6760 East Irvington Place #1700
       Denver CO 80280-1700

  IC 2002-1 TO AFI 36-2504, OFFICER PROMOTION, CONTINUATION AND SELECTIVE
               EARLY REMOVAL IN THE RESERVE OF THE AIR FORCE


14 JANUARY 2002


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2002-1. This change affects the USAFR only and estab-
lishes a 2 year Time in Grade for First Lieutenants to be promoted to the grade of Captain. This change
modifies Table 2.1. to reflect 2 years. It establishes separate competitive categories (COMPCATs) for
promotion consideration for officers assigned to the Selected Reserve (SELRES) and Non-Selected
Reserve (NON-SELRES). This change adds subparagraph 2.4.11. that defines the category the SECAF
assigns an officer to compete for promotion and adds Table 2.3. which outlines the new COMPCATs.


2.4.11. Competitive Categories (CompCat). Each officer on the Reserve Active Status List (RASL) is
placed in a competitive category as specified by the SecAF. Officers in the same CompCat will compete
among themselves for promotion, continuation, and selective early removal. The ANG and USAFR com-
pete in separate categories. Both ANG and USAFR are further divided as shown in Table 2.2. and Table
2.3. Each CompCat has a separately computed quota for promotions, continuation, and selective early
removal. The SecAF determines the available quotas each year based on projected needs of the ANG and
USAFR.

               EARLY REMOVAL IN THE RESERVE OF THE AIR FORCE


11 FEBRUARY 2002


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS


This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2002-2. This change affects the promotion eligibility crite-
ria for officers serving on Limited Active Duty (LEAD). Specifically, this change permits Reserve Active
Status List promotion eligibility for Air Force Reserve (AFR) and Air National Guard (ANG) officers
who are serving on LEAD tours of three years or less. AFR/ANG officer serving LEAD tours greater than
three years are not RASL eligible and compete for promotion on the ADL. This change affects the
USAFR and delegates approval authority for AGR(formerly known as stat tour) promotions to AF/RE
IAW AFI 36-2504 para 6.6. This change modifies Table 5.2. , note 3 and paragraph 6.6. to reflect AF/RE
has AGR approval authority vice SAF/MIR. A bar ( | ) indicates revision from the previous edition.


2.4. Eligibility Criteria and Restrictions. The following criteria are restriction apply for promotions to
grades of captain through lieutenant colonel (ANGUS) through colonel (USAFR) Promotion Eligibility.


2.4.11. Officers who voluntarily remain on LEAD for subsequent tours, will be transferred to the ADL at
the three-year and one day point and compete for promotion under DOPMA provisions (ADL) when they
meet the established promotion eligibility criteria. LEAD officers who desire to remain promotion eligi-
ble under ROPMA provisions (RASL) must return to the AFR/ANG for a minimum of one year prior to
returning to LEAD. Officers who are voluntarily returned to lead before the one-year has expired will
have orders generated that are greater than three years, which automatically places them of the ADL.

Notes:
1. The US Senate confirms promotions to colonel and above.
2. DOR will never be earlier than the public release date.
3. AGRs will pin on the new rank only if USAFR strength limits are not exceeded and the promotion is
approved by HQ USAF/RE . (AGRs may delay declination of promotion until date released from the
tour.)
4. This date can be no earlier than the public release date (if the officer is in the position at that time), or
the date the officer is placed in the higher graded position (when after public release date) and meets all
the criteria. The letter must arrive at HQ ARPC/DPJA 2 business days before the proposed DOR. See also
paragraph 6.5.
5. HQ USAF/REP makes USAFR colonel promotions incrementally.
6. Example: A first lieutenant with a DOR of 15 Mar 93, is not selected by the FY98 Captain Promotion
Board. The officer meets the FY99 Captain Promotion Board and is selected. The officer’s DOR to cap-
tain is 1 October 1998, the first of October of the Fiscal Year of the board.
7. Calculate the officer’s date as if selected (using the eligibility criteria based on the officer’s service
dates) by a Reserve of the Air Force Selection Board. However, at no time will the date be sooner than the
date of the officer’s transfer to the RASL. Also, see paragraph 6.5.




6.6. Promotion Procedures for USAFR AGRs. All AGR officers selected for promotion to the grade of
colonel and below must obtain approval from AF/RE before the officer can assume the higher grade. For
AGRs assigned to HQ AFRC, HQ AFRC/DPM (for lieutenant colonel selects and below), and HQ AFRC/
DPO (for colonel selects) will send the request for the officer to assume the higher grade to HQ USAF/
REAMO for processing to HQ USAF/RE. For other headquarters assigned AGRs, USAF/REAMO will
prepare the request and process it to HQ USAF/RE for approval. The memo will include a recommenda-
tion for promotion, position control number, PAS code, and authorized grade for the position to which
assigned.

     IC 2003-1 TO AFI 36-2504, OFFICER PROMOTION, CONTINUATION AND SELECTIVE
                  EARLY REMOVAL IN THE RESERVE OF THE AIR FORCE


9 JANUARY 2003


SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This change incorporates interim change (IC) 2003-1. Except where noted, these changes apply to the
ANG/and USAFR. These changes permit Air Reserve Component officers to compete for promotion
under the Reserve Active Status List (RASL) while mobilized and explain administrative procedures to
accomplish. This change adds Para 6.7. A bar (|) indicates revision from the previous edition.


6.7. ANG and USAFR officers are eligible to compete for position vacancy and mandatory promotion on
the Reserve Active Status List (RASL), when the promotion board is convened IAW Title 10 USC
14101(a), while the officers are mobilized under Title 10 USC 12302 commonly known as partial mobili-
zation.


6.7.1. For USAFR Colonel selects only while mobilized under Title 10 USC 12302: (for normal pin on
rules see AFI 36-2115, Assignments within the Reserve Components para 1.5.5.4 applies)


6.7.1.1. Officers may elect to voluntarily delay their promotions IAW Title 10 USC 14312 and Chapter 8
of this AFI. They may elect to pin on their promotions on promotion effective date- with or without hav-
ing a higher graded reserve billet. If the Colonel select does not have a higher graded reserve billet, the
member may continue to look for a higher graded billet for up to 6 months after promotion effective date
or 45 days after the member is demobilized whichever is later.


6.7.1.2. Colonel Selects who have a higher graded reserve billet may have their promotions accelerated to
a date no earlier than Senate Confirmation if they already are incumbent in a higher grade reserve billet
during the time they are mobilized under this statute and they meet the accelerate guidelines of this AFI in
Chapter 6 .


Note that AGR colonel selects may be involuntarily delayed in pin on due to strength limitations of the
AGR force imposed by law. Paragraph 8.7. of this AFI applies to mobilized AGRs as well.


6.7.2. For USAFR Colonel selects not mobilized upon actual pin-on date; If the officer has not located a
vacant colonel authorization, the MPF should project the officer for assignment to ARPC (non selected
reserve) with an EDCSA of 6 months from pin-on date. At 60 days prior to EDCSA (4 months after
pin-on date), if the officer has still not yet located a vacant colonel position, the MPF should, through
AFI36-2504 9 JANUARY 2003                                                                               93


command channels, request a stop loss waiver to allow reassignment of the officer to ARPC on the estab-
lished 6 month EDCSA date.


6.7.3. USAFR officers selected for PV promotion may pin on while mobilized under Title 10 USC 12302
when the mobilized officer’s Senior Rater submits a signed letter to ARPC/DPBA stating the officer is “in
the reserve position”. The promotion effective date can be no earlier than 2 business days after receipt of
the letter by ARPC; or the date the officer meets the Time In Grade requirements in Table 2.1. of this AFI
whichever is later; or the officer is demobilized from Title 10 USC 12302. The promotion effective date
in this case will be the day after demobilization or the date the officer meets the Time In Grade require-
ments in Table 2.2. of this AFI whichever is later.
