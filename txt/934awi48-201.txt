SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Radiation references were updated to the current AFI radiation standards, IRSO is the
Installation Radiation Safety Officer, and the 934 AW storage areas for unrestricted radioactive
material was added. Telephone numbers have been updated.
1. General. As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) is a program covering all Air Force
operations involving the use of radioactive materials or radiation producing devices. The
ALARA concept is defined as that set of management and administrative actions taken to reduce

personnel radiation doses to as low a level as possible consistent with mission requirements. See
Attachment 1 for the Glossary of References and Supporting Information for this AWI.
2. Procedures. It is Air Force policy that all exposures to ionizing radiation be kept ALARA.
There should be no exposure to ionizing radiation without an expected benefit and the dose
received should be the lowest possible consistent with the state of technology, costs and
operational requirement.

   commander shall designate a unit RSO and an Alternate in writing.
   4.3. The installation and unit RSOs will conduct all duties outlined in the responsibilities
   stated above. Specifically, these duties include but are not limited to the following:
      4.3.1. The installation RSO will perform annual surveys of NDI lab and dental x-ray.
      These surveys will include measurements of radiation outside the shielded facilities
      during simulated x-ray operations to evaluate the shielding factor of the facilities. For the
      NDI lab, the survey will also include an evaluation of operations performed at the

      4.3.3. The installation RSO or an alternate will distribute and collect the thermo
      luminescent dosimeters (TLD badges) quarterly only for the NDI lab. The unit RSO will
      ensure all personnel wear dosimeters properly. The unit RSO will receive, interpret and
      document results of TLD monitoring. The Unit RSO will ensure all personnel are
      informed of these results. In the event of a potential overexposure the installation RSO
      will conduct an investigation with assistance from the unit RSO.

        4.3.4. If females that work in any of the above listed areas should become pregnant, they
        should notify their supervisor, the unit RSO and the Installation RSO immediately, before
        returning to duties involving radiation. Their duties will be evaluated as part of the base
        fetal protection program. If not administratively removed from radiation tasks by their
        doctor or supervisor, they will also be enrolled on the monthly TLD program as specified
        in AFMAN 48-125. All information gathered or recorded concerning the pregnancy will
