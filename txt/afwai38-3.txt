coordinating changes within their directorate or group before following the routing instructions
in section 3.4.

   coordinated through the appropriate chain of command to the director or group commander
   before following guidance provided in section 3.4.

       3.3.2. Second paragraph---JUSTIFICATION. This paragraph should consist of: Why is
       the action needed? What are the expected benefits? (Identify factors driving the need for
       the action, e.g., reduction in authorizations due to cuts, changes to mission or concepts of
       operations. Generalized statements such as increased mission capability or reduced span
       of control are not adequate as justifications.
       3.3.3. Third paragraph---POC. This paragraph should reflect the POC’s information.
       The POC may be the same as the action officer.
       3.3.4. Last paragraph---RECOMMENDATION. This paragraph should clearly describe
       the action(s) you want to take place.
       3.3.5. Attach the completed Manpower/Authorization Change Request Worksheet (see
       Atch 5) which details the breakout of the exact positions to be changed on the OCR,
       current organization structure (see Atch 3) and proposed structure charts (see Atch 4).
       3.3.6. Attach updated mission directives.
