SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

1. Program Objectives: The primary purpose of the USAF OPSEC program is to deny Critical
Information (CI) to our adversaries. It also strives to promote understanding and awareness of
the benefits of OPSEC among all Air Force members. The 56th Fighter Wing OPSEC program
is designed to:

1.1. Support the commander in achieving the primary goal of a successful and effective mission.

1.2. Ensure that OPSEC is considered in the planning, execution and post-operation phases of all
plans and exercises.

1.3. Prevent the disclosure of information containing intelligence indicators that can be used to
degrade operational effectiveness.

1.4. Prevent potential intelligence information, which is not classified, from becoming available
to unauthorized persons.

1.5. Develop good security habits which will ensure that we protect information that could be of
value to hostile intelligence.

1.6. Afford maximum protection to all classified matters.

1.7. Ensure all 56 FW personnel receive awareness training in OPSEC and the CI's. See
Attachment 1.

1.8. Ensure OPSEC is stressed before, during, and after all applicable contingencies.

2. Program Administration: The 56 FW Chief of Plans is designated as the 56 FW OPSEC
Program Manager. The 56 FW Plans Office (XP) is designated as the 56 FW Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) for OPSEC.

responsible for the appropriate use of the OPSEC concept and must ensure OPSEC guidance is
developed as early as possible in the planning and coordination process.

2.1.1. Appointment of Group OPSEC Coordinators: Group Commanders will appoint a primary
and alternate OPSEC coordinator who is thoroughly familiar with the group's operations. In
order to ensure that OPSEC is considered as early as possible in the planning and coordination
process, the primary should be the Group Plans Representative, or from the same office. A
memorandum of appointment will be forwarded to 56 FW/XP within 10 days of appointment
using the format in Attachment 2 of this instruction. Group OPSEC Coordinators will be trained
by the OPSEC Program Manager within 30 days of receiving an appointment memorandum. The
appointment memorandum and training date will be maintained by the OPSEC Program Manager
and Group OPSEC Coordinator.

and exercises.
