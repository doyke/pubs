    1.3.2.2. Upon receipt of a new item, ensure an appropriate container is available. If
    the item is received without a container, and an appropriate container is not available
    at the unit, annotate “No SPI container available” on the issue document.
    1.3.2.3. For items stored in incorrect containers, ensure copies of WEBSDR
    submittal and AF Forms 451 are kept with the containers.
    1.3.2.4. Ensure an AF Form 451 accompanies any item turned in to 8 LRS/LGRD
    without a prescribed SPI or Fast Pack container (Note: Items missing an appropriate
    container will not be accepted without a completed AF Form 451), or when
    packaging services are required.
    1.3.2.5. Provide a covered, clean, and dry space to store reusable containers and
    packing materials. Note: Wood containers will be stored in their assembled
    configuration, not knocked down/broken apart. Also, all internal packaging,
    blocking, braces and cushioning must remain stored with the respective container.
    1.3.2.6. Mark storage areas with clearly visible signs reading, “REUSABLE
    CONTAINER STORAGE AREA.”
    1.3.2.7. Educate unit members about proper storage and use of reusable containers.
    1.3.2.8. Ensure appropriate steps are taken to maximize reusable container usage in
    the unit.
    1.3.2.9. Attend RCP working group meetings.
    1.3.2.10. Provide 8 LRS/LGRD with a list of excess reusable containers, to facilitate
    disposition coordination. Note: Certain FSC 8140 and 8145 specialized containers
    may be loaded on organizational equipment accounts. For these items, URCMs will
    need to also coordinate with 8 LRS/LGRM.

                   PROCEDURES FOR COMPLETING AF FORM 451

A5.1. Submitting AF Form 451. When AF Forms 451 are required, a minimum of five copies
will be prepared. Three copies will be provided to the Packaging and Preservation Office. The
original will remain with the item until packaging is complete. The final copy will be
maintained for document control.
A5.2. Request Control Log. Document control copies are not required if a request control log
is maintained. Control logs, at a minimum, will reflect the information indicated on the AF
Form 451, including the initiation date, request number, requesting organization, item requested,
purpose, and date completed. If a log is maintained, original versions of AF Forms 451 will be
filed, in request number sequence, after the packing service is completed. If a copy is
maintained for document control purposes, it will be replaced with the original after the packing
service is completed.
A5.3. Preparing AF Form 451. All entries on AF Forms 451 may be handwritten. The
guidance that follows corresponds to the blocks shown on the form.
   A5.3.1. Date. Enter the date that you initiate the form.
   A5.3.2. Priority. Enter the supply priority and required delivery date assigned to the
   shipping document. If the request is for a service instead of a shipment, enter the date that
   you need the service.
   A5.3.3. Request No. Document control request numbers should be assigned as requests are
   received. Recommend numbers be assigned in ascending sequence for one year, starting at
   the beginning of each calendar year.
   A5.3.4. To. Enter the organization symbol or name of the packaging activity.
   A5.3.5. From. Enter the organization symbol or name of the activity initiating the request.
   If the form is prepared during the supply turn-in process, enter the symbol or name of the
   activity turning-in the item. Do not enter the symbol or name of the supply activity unless
   the item is being shipped (or packaged for storage) from supply stock. Enter the name of the
   person to contact for information on the request.
   A5.3.6. Shipping Document No. Enter the TCN from accompanying documentation. If
   none is available, enter “N/A”.
