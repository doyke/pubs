Internal Control Toolset (MICT). This revision adds the requirements to use the MICT database
to record and track all deficiencies (identified via internal and external inspections not covered
by another program). Inspector General Evaluation Management System (IGEMS) duties and
Wing Staff Agency and Group Commander/Self-Assessment Manager duties were added. As
the Eglin AFB Gatekeeper, the 96 TW/IG will monitor all 96 TW inspection visits at Eglin AFB
and the 96 TG at Holloman AFB. Duties pertaining to all 96 TW internal exercises/inspections
(e.g., Self-Assessment Program and MICT) and external inspections (e.g., CUIs, ORIs, SIIs, and
CIIs) and respective follow-on deficiencies management/close-out will reside within 96
TW/XPRO.

annual, biannual or as-needed assessments. 96 AMDS/SGPB will provide to the monitoring
entity shop-specific (local) checklists based on the HAF OHCAMP checklist, but tailored for the
