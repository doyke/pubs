                                           Chapter 3

                                AERIAL DELIVERY FLIGHT

3.1. General. This chapter specifies the organization, mission, and operating requirements for
aerial port units with an Aerial Delivery section.
3.2. Organization, Mission and Operations. Aerial delivery organization, mission, and basic
operations are found in applicable portions of AMCI 24-101, Volume 18, AMC Mobilized Aerial
Port Forces and Aerial Delivery Flights, and AFI 13-210_IP, Joint Airdrop Inspection Records,
Malfunction/Incidents, Investigations, and Activity Reporting. They support tactical unit moves,
resupply, and aerial delivery of personnel, equipment, and supplies during peacetime operations.
This is a peacetime only authorization/ requirement.
3.3. Guidelines:
   3.3.1. Primary responsibility of the aerial delivery section is to support aircrew training.
   Duties include: building, loading, and rigging airdrop loads; packing and drying parachutes;
   scheduling and coordinating loading operations; performing airdrop inspections, material
   control, and drop zone (DZ) recovery.
   3.3.2. Local flying squadrons are responsible for managing and supervising all activities at
   the DZ. Aerial port units provide personnel and vehicles for recovery of airdropped loads and
   transport of equipment to and from the DZ. Local guidelines determine procurement,
   management, accountability, and storage issues regarding DZ equipment.
   3.3.3. The local flying unit is responsible for aircrew training for loadmasters assigned to
   aerial port units. The aerial port Senior ART will coordinate scheduling of training between,
   aircrew scheduler in the flying unit, and individual concerned.
   3.3.4. The unit Senior ART/unit rigger will coordinate with the Aircraft Loadmaster Section
   to ensure sufficient airdrop training loads is available to meet the aircrews’ training schedule.
   Loadmaster personnel assigned to the aerial delivery section must complete J5AZA1A251
   0F5A, Airdrop Load Inspector Certification Course to perform final joint inspections on
   equipment and supply loads to be airdropped from aircraft.
   3.3.5. The unit commander determines the required number of 2T2X1s to support aircrew
   airdrop training mission requirement. 2T2X1 personnel identified to support the Aerial
   Delivery Support Branch (ADSB) will train and become proficient in air/land cargo
   operations. Only 5-level or above personnel will be assigned to Aerial Delivery and must
   complete L9AZA2T251 00AA, Airdrop Specialist Course.
   3.3.6. Per AFI 13–210_IP, Air National Guard (ANG) and AF Reserve Command units, air
   transportation specialists (AFSC 2T2X1) or aircraft loadmasters (AFSC 1A2X1) who have
   successfully completed the US Army Quartermaster Center & School’s (USAQMC&S)
   Fabrication of Aerial Deliver Load Course (FADLC) or airdrop specialist phase of the
   Parachute Rigger Course may perform the before-loading inspection as the AF Joint Airdrop
   Inspector (AFJAI) and sign the before-loading inspection Air Force’s inspector block. A
   certified AFJAI (AFSC 1A2X1) must accomplish the after-loading inspection and sign the
   after-loading Air Force’s inspector block. The aircrew secondary loadmaster and the primary
   loadmaster, with MAJCOM approval, can accomplish the after-loading inspection on rigged
AFRCI24-101 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                                 11


  alternate method, zodiac loads only. The primary loadmaster does the loading and in-aircraft
  rigging. The secondary loadmaster will sign the Air Force’s inspector block on the Joint
  inspection record. This will be done only as an absolute necessity when there is no certified
  AFJAI available to conduct the after-loading inspection.

                                           Chapter 4

                                TRAINING DEPLOYMENTS

4.1. General. This chapter identifies preparation and general actions necessary for aerial port
unit/team training deployments i.e. UTA, Drive/Fly-aways, Annual Training (AT), and
Exercises. This chapter also outlines references, guidelines, and responsibilities (NOT all-
inclusive). A deployment checklist is provided in Attachment 2.
4.2. Guidelines
   4.2.1. Annual Training Tours. The scheduling process begins in the 4th Qtr of each fiscal
   year for the following fiscal year. (See Table 4.1) The scheduling process includes members
   from each NAF, HQ AMC, National Guard Bureau (NGB) and HQ AFRC/A4RT.
   4.2.2. HQ AFRC/A4RT will initiate a planning schedule and coordinate it through the
   process outlined in Table 4.1. All tasked agencies must complete their actions by the
   indicated suspense date to ensure a viable product.
   4.2.3. AT tours are used to obtain maximum hands-on training. Team size depends on
   support capability of the training site and training needs of the deploying unit. An entire unit
   may be scheduled for AT to support an exercise (e.g. Patriot Hook, Global Medic, etc.)
   4.2.4. To facilitate effective scheduling, unit commanders should consider the following:
       4.2.4.1. AEF obligations.
       4.2.4.2. Inspections (i.e. LCAP, Operational Readines Inspection (ORI), Operations
       Readiness Exercise (ORE), Compliance Inspection (CI), etc.)
       4.2.4.3. Scheduling guidelines
       4.2.4.3.1. To the greatest extent possible, schedule ATs at home station if required
       training is available. Consider specialty training at home station as well. Units deploying
       off station must utilize the closest training location that can provide the needed training
       for each member on the team.
          4.2.4.3.2. Units will not schedule more than 50 percent of unit authorized personnel
          to Outside Continental US (OCONUS) locations during the same fiscal year. Units
          must provide strong justification, to schedule the majority of their personnel for
          OCONUS locations.
          4.2.4.3.3. Only one transcontinental AT tour consisting of not more than 25 percent
          of the unit authorized personnel may be scheduled during a fiscal year.
          4.2.4.3.4. The first priority for requesting individuals training during an AT tour
          should be skill level upgrade requirements and secondary priority should be each
          individual’s assigned UTC training requirements if not fully qualified in their UTC
          position.
   4.2.5. Categories of Training:
       4.2.5.1. High OPS tempo - Proficiency training with minimal upgrade training.
       4.2.5.2. Low OPS tempo - Upgrade training with minimal proficiency training.
AFRCI24-101 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                                       13


        4.2.5.3. Exercises - Combination of proficiency, upgrade and management opportunities.
        4.2.5.4. Patriot Partners – Active port take overs with a combination of proficiency,
        upgrade and management opportunities may be used when preparing for deployments
        and inspections with AEF or ORI partners. The full two weeks will be utilized when a
        Readiness Assessment Team (RAT) is scheduled.

  4.2.6. Drive/Fly-away
      4.2.6.1. Units must submit non-scheduled deployment requests to their appropriate NAF.
      Once the NAF POC validates these requests, they are forwarded to AFRC/A4RT using
      the AFRC/A4RT website for submission into SMS and presentation to the DRB.
      4.2.6.2. UTA fly-away deployments are organic airlift only; no AFRC DRB commercial
      funding will be authorized. UTA drive-aways are permitted when the deployment
      destination is within reasonable driving distance. Unit Commanders may request UTA
      fly-away/drive-away deployment as deemed necessary. The use of five or more UTA
      periods (whenever possible) is recommended to maximize airlift, training facilities, and
      equipment at the deployed location. NOTE: Personnel cannot travel in a UTA status
      without being able to perform six hours of duty before or after travel to location. Units
      should consider using a DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for TDY Travel of
      DoD Personnel, for travel with conversion into UTA status.
  4.2.7. Patriot Partner Exercise
      4.2.7.1. Patriot Partner Exercises are authorized for AT with primary emphasis on the
      Air Reserve Component’s (ARC) partial takeover of the active duty aerial port. The
      percentage of the takeover must be agreed upon by the active duty unit and the ARC units
      involved. These exercises provide the ARC with excellent management opportunities.
      4.2.7.2. Patriot Partner exercises require additional coordination due to the number of
      participants. These participants may come from one or several AF Reserve and/or ANG
      units. When more than one unit is involved, a lead unit must be identified. The unit with
      the greatest number of participants will be designated as the lead unit.
      4.2.7.3. The lead unit is responsible for conducting a Patriot Partner Planning Meeting to
      coordinate unit efforts and formalizing the Patriot Partner Plan.
AFRCI24-101 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                                         15


      4.2.7.4. AMC aerial port locations requesting and/or agreeing to host a Patriot Partner
      must ensure on-base billeting is requested and secured through the host-base billeting
      office. Immediately following the DRB, AMC Aerial Port Reserve Coordinators will be
      provided a list of units and number of personnel participating in each Patriot Partner
      Exercise to coordinate lodging, government transportation to/from duty section, and
      dining facilities. Failure to do so may result in cancellation due to funding.
   4.2.8. Exercise Deployments
      4.2.8.1. All participation by AFRC unit personnel in exercise activity (e.g. Red Flag,
      Global Medic, Patriot Hook, etc.) will be tracked by HQ AFRC/A4RX. Unit(s)/personnel
      participating in a named exercise will submit a Deployment Review (DR) request IAW
      AFRCI 10-204. As a minimum, when a transportation request is not applicable,
      ―Information Only‖ DR request will be submitted in SMS.
      4.2.8.2. For operations and training activities that utilize the radio frequency spectrum,
      users must comply with AFI 33-118, Chapter 3, Electromagnetic Spectrum Management.
      Coordinate with the local frequency managers before operating any radio
      (UHF/VHF/FM/HF) equipment.
4.3. Approval Process Overview.
   4.3.1. All training deployments requiring organic airlift must be approved by the DRB.
   AFRC/A4 will convene a DRB, as required.
   4.3.2. Training deployments are entered into SMS.
      4.3.2.1. Training deployments will be entered with an activity code of ―P‖ (Pending).
      Upon approval by the DRB, the activity code will be changed to ―A‖ (Approved) and
      electronically sent to AFRC/FGOC to solicit organic airlift during the Airlift Allocation
      Conference (AAC).
      4.3.2.2. Home station or drive-away deployments will be entered with an activity code of
      ―I‖ (Informational) in SMS. Once it has been briefed to the DRB, the activity code will
      be changed to ―B‖ (Briefed).
   4.3.3. The AAC is held on a quarterly basis, to determine the availability of organic airlift.
   4.3.4. If organic airlift is unavailable, and the deployment was approved for commercial
   travel funds, units will forward a request for funding using an automated worksheet found on
   the AFRC/A4RT web site under ARC Deployments. Funding for travel is divided into two
   categories:
      4.3.4.1. CONUS - AFRC funded: Travel costs associated with stateside deployments, or
      to get team to/from Aerial Port of Embarkation (APOE) for OCONUS deployments.
      4.3.4.2. OCONUS - AMC funded: Travel costs associated between the
      APOE/Commercial Gateway to the OCONUS training location. If AMC channel or
      charter (Patriot Express) flights are not available when team needs to travel, then AMC
      will provide travel funding door-to-door. Once commercial travel is procured, it will not
      be cancelled within 30 days of departure date, even if organic airlift becomes available.
   4.3.5. Changes or cancellation of scheduled deployments must be coordinated through the
   NAF and training location to prevent adverse affects on host base (training location)

     choose to use trainers from other sections to administer the TA.
     9.3.5.5. Complete the Air Force Training Course.
9.4. ATSEV/QA Program Guidance.
  9.4.1. Training. A key facet of a unit’s training program is individual job qualification
  training. OJT ensures individuals are qualified to perform specific duties and tasks associated
  with their current duty position. ATSEV and the use of QTPs create a standardized training
  program.
  9.4.2. QTPs are training packages designed to aid trainers and evaluators in the evaluation
  process. QTPs contain either Task Training Guides (TTGs) or Knowledge Training Guides
  (KTGs).
     9.4.2.1. Task-oriented QTPs consist of a TTG, lesson plan, TA and a TEC. The TTG is a
     training guide used by the trainer. It includes: task number, training objectives, training
     references, prerequisites/requirements/equipment, an estimated completion time, and
     training steps. The TEC is an evaluation that contains a task checklist and blocks for
     annotating compliance.
     9.4.2.2. Knowledge based QTPs consist of, at a minimum, a KTG. Not all Knowledge
     based QTPs include a Lesson Plan, TA and/or a TEC. It does include task number,
     training objectives, training references, and prerequisites.
AFRCI24-101 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                                   31


  9.4.3. TAs are administered IAW paragraphs 9.3.4.4 through 9.3.4.7. of this publication.
  9.4.4. Individuals who do not meet minimum test score requirements or who do not
  satisfactorily complete the TEC will continue with training until the requirements are met.
  The UPM and supervisor will determine if re-training will be accomplished by the same
  trainer. NOTE: At no time will the score of an individual’s TA be used as a basis for job
  performance. The TA is used to ensure training was properly conducted and the required
  knowledge was attained.
  9.4.5. For personnel trained by active duty trainers, completed TECs will be given to the
  Reserve Team Chief for documentation in TBA and include training data in the TTR.
  9.4.6. Units must use QTPs for all duty position training. This requirement also applies to
  TDY personnel.
  9.4.7. When personnel change to a new duty section, they must be entered into duty position
  training using the appropriate QTPs in their new MTL. Personnel must also undergo a PA
  before taking on any task within the section. During the PA, if it is determined QTP training
  has not been completed for that specific task; training must be re-accomplished using the
  QTP. AMCI 24-101, Volume 22, Section C addresses the PA, mandates entry in the
  individual’s training record, and provides additional guidance. NOTE: PAs will be
  accomplished on personnel that have not performed in their duty position for at least six
  months. (i.e. Security Forces augmentee, etc.).
  9.4.8. Individuals previously trained with an earlier QTP, who cannot complete the PA will
  be entered into training using the current QTP.
  9.4.9. All personnel, including Senior NCOs providing training must have completed the
  current QTP and documented in TBA with a journal entry.
  9.4.10. MHE Evaluations. Safe and proper MHE operation is of the utmost importance. To
  ensure personnel remain proficient on the vehicles used within their duty section all operators
  must receive an annual evaluation for each vehicle on their license. Evaluators are not an
  extension of the workforce and will not provide assistance to the individual being evaluated.
  Individuals who fail to successfully complete the evaluation will be provided training in
  deficient areas. Individuals will be re-evaluated once the training is complete. All annual
  MHE evaluations must be properly documented in TBA.
  9.4.11. Evaluations. This is the formal process to ensure effectiveness of air transportation
  processes and identify areas for improvement. They provide leadership with factual
  information about the health and effectiveness of the unit and training. Accurate assessments
  of personnel proficiency and processes are critical to measuring unit effectiveness.
  9.4.12. Process evaluations are assessments of procedures required to accomplish the unit’s
  mission. Every effort should be made to evaluate personnel in the performance of their
  transportation duties. Safety is paramount in all processes and evaluations.
  9.4.13. All personnel involved in performing the process are subject to evaluation, to include
  Senior NCOs.
  9.4.14. There are two evaluation categories: Personnel Evaluation (PE) and Quality
  Verification Inspection (QVI).
32                                                        AFRCI24-101 3 DECEMBER 2012


     9.4.14.1. A PE is an evaluation of an activity as it is being performed. The focus of these
     is typically on the process or the person/team performing the task/process.
     9.4.14.2. A QVI is an evaluation of a completed task. QVIs will only be accomplished
     for a process that can be adequately measured after completion. Do not perform QVIs on
     processes that require direct observation to determine proper accomplishment
  9.4.15. Rating Criteria. Assign one of the following ratings to every process evaluation:
     9.4.15.1. A Pass rating indicates the process met the acceptable standard.
     9.4.15.2. A Fail rating indicates the process did not meet acceptable standards due to
     major findings or minor findings exceeded the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL). The
     standard AQL for each task is two (2).
  9.4.16. Minor Finding. Any deficiency that is procedurally incorrect but only has minor
  mission impact.
  9.4.17. Major Finding. Any deficiency that results or could result in widespread or
  significant mission impact or failure. May include any repeat minor finding deemed
  appropriate by the ATSEV Program Manager. When these conditions are observed, correct
  them immediately. Under no circumstance will a safety or equipment reliability error go
  uncorrected. The evaluator will consider the seriousness of the error when deciding whether
  or not the member(s) performing the process, and the evaluation itself, should continue.
  9.4.18. Suspense all evaluations to the ATSEV/QA UPM and responsible supervisor for
  information/corrective action. Work centers will respond to all findings by stating the action
  taken to resolve the identified problem to include an ECD. Unit commanders will be briefed
  on open/closed items monthly.
  9.4.19. MHE monitors must review all individuals’ training record for vehicle evaluations
  receiving a Fail rating to verify training documentation (i.e., have individuals been trained,
  have yearly MHE evaluations been conducted, etc.). Identify and document discrepancies to
  the UTM for follow-up action.
  9.4.20. Results of all evaluations are recorded on QTP TECs and entered into the
  ATSEV/QA data base. Units will file the completed sheets by respective year and maintain
  them for six months. File maintenance can be done via hard copy or electronically. If done
  electronically, ensure routine backups are accomplished. Failure to provide data due to
  computer downtimes and/or problems will not be an acceptable reason during inspections.

              MANAGEMENT OF AERIAL PORT TRAINING AID (APTA)

11.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for acquisition, funding, use, operation,
inspection, maintenance and disposition of Aerial Port Training Aids (APTA). APTAs are
aerospace vehicles permanently grounded and their primary purpose is to serve as a hands-on
training device for AFRC aerial port units. This chapter applies to the TPC and AFRC aerial port
units who request/possess APTAs.
11.2. Acquisition Requirements:
   11.2.1. In order to obtain Command approval to acquisition an APTA trainer, the requesting
   unit must prepare, staff, and coordinate a completed Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) and
   supporting documentation for obtaining permission to allow long term parking for the APTA
   from the Base or Installation Commander at a specific location.
   11.2.2. Requesting unit initiates a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or memorandum
   of agreement (MOA) with an aircraft maintenance unit within AFRC area of responsibility
   capable of supporting the maintenance requirements for the particular type of APTA aircraft.
   These agreements should include but are not limited to:
       11.2.2.1. RPA man-day funding requirements for personnel.
       11.2.2.2. O&M funding requirements, that is, replacement parts, supplies, travel, and
       per-diem, etc.
       11.2.2.3. Funding for required APTA inspections.
   11.2.3. Once an MOU/MOA is established and approved locally, forward, along with the
   locally approved staff summary sheet, to the appropriate NAF POC for approval,
   concurrence and coordination.
   11.2.4. If approved at the NAF level, the request is vetted through HQ
   AFRC/A4M/A4R/A4O for Concurrence, A4OS for Info, and A4 for Approval. Once
   approved by A4, A4OS will submit a request to Air Staff for approval/disapproval.
   11.2.5. Once approved, all APTA requests are placed on projects approved by HQ
   USAF/A8PB and returned to HQ AFRC/A4OS for sourcing.
11.3. Responsibilities.
   11.3.1. The commander or appropriate authority for the organization/unit possessing the
   APTA appoints an APTA Custodian, in writing, to serve as primary point of contact for
   APTA issues and activities.
   11.3.2. Unit APTA Custodian will:
       11.3.2.1. Ensure required publications, technical orders (T.O.), forms, and checklists are
       available and used in managing APTA activities to include maintenance inspections and
       repairs.
       11.3.2.2. Establish and maintain a log reflecting date and time of use, type of inspections

      11.3.2.4. Ensure all inspections and maintenance is performed in a timely manner and
      according to applicable publications and T.O.s.
      11.3.2.5. Ensure owning organization/unit develops local instructions defining the scope
      of unit training requiring the use of the APTA. The instruction must also identify
      functional responsibility for funding, operations, maintenance, records management, and
      specific unit guidance.
11.4. Training Requirements:
   11.4.1. Senior management of the owning organization designates, in writing, the APTA
   custodian, APTA Supervisor and operator(s) and forwards a copy of the appointment letter to
   their respective NAF/POC.
   11.4.2. The TPC conducts initial training for all unit custodians and operator(s) on
   procedures, T.O.s, and equipment specifics of the APTAs. Arrange directly with the TPC at
   Dobbins ARB, GA.
   11.4.3. Unit Custodians will:
      11.4.3.1. Attend biennial training at the TPC.
      11.4.3.2. Provide biennial refresher training and certification for operators at the unit
      level.
      11.4.3.3. Ensure training is documented in the individual’s training records in TBA.
      11.4.3.4. Establish and maintain a log reflecting date and time of use, type of training,
      unit being trained, and the name of the APTA Custodian/Supervisor conducting the
      training.
      11.4.3.5. All qualified APTA Custodian/Supervisors must be trained by qualified
      maintenance personnel possessing the required AFSC on active systems and subsystems
      and the necessary actions to maintain the aerospace vehicle in a safe and presentable
      condition.
11.5. Maintenance.
   11.5.1. General. Permanently grounded aerospace vehicles are those considered excess to
   future operation or flying requirements by Headquarters Air Force (HQ USAF). Aircraft in
   this category are re-designated by adding the prefix "G" to the basic mission design series
   (MDS) and are identified with assignment code "TX". The system program manager (SPM)
   initiates the save list of items to be removed. HQ AFRC/A4QR, in coordination with the unit,
   reviews and approves the listing ensuring items to be removed are not required for the
   training program and will not disfigure the external appearance of the aircraft. After items on
   the save list have been removed, removal of additional items must be approved by HQ
   AFRC/A4QR. Turn in all excess items not required in the training program to base supply.
   11.5.2. An APTA Supervisor is assigned in writing by the owning organization or by the use
   of a MOU or MOA with an organization which possesses the required maintenance AFSCs.
   This individual must possess the technical expertise, management skills, and leadership
AFRCI24-101 3 DECEMBER 2012                                                                   39


  ability to assure quality maintenance standards of equipment condition, reliability, and safety
  are attained. The APTA Supervisor is responsible for coordinating maintenance actions;
  ensuring documentation is accurate and complete; and for being qualified to operate APTA
  systems and appropriate support equipment to conduct APTA maintenance.
  11.5.3. APTA Maintenance.          APTA maintenance includes on and off equipment
  maintenance of active systems and subsystems and necessary actions to maintain the
  aerospace vehicle in a safe and presentable condition. Owning organization:
     11.5.3.1. Determines systems and subsystems required to be operational and maintained
     in the same configuration as operational equipment.
     11.5.3.2. Ensures standard maintenance practices regarding inspection, appearance,
     cleanliness, ground safety and prevention of corrosion are met. Corrosion control
     procedures are outlined in T.O. 1-1-691, Cleaning and Corrosion Prevention and Control,
     Aerospace and Non-Aerospace Equipment.
     11.5.3.3. Develops, prepares, and updates APTA Supervisor inspection checklists used
     for inspecting the condition and safety of APTAs. These checklists are developed from
     the actual weapons system home station check (HSC) work deck and approved by an
     aircraft maintenance organization with the appropriate AFSCs assigned. Ensure
     inspections are performed using approved pre/post checklists. Ensure periodic
     maintenance inspections are conducted by qualified aircraft maintenance personnel at
     least semi-annually using the tailored HSC work deck. These checklists must be validated
     as needed by the aircraft maintenance organization performing the semi-annual
     inspection and maintenance.
     11.5.3.4. Ensures accurate maintenance documentation. APTA mandatory AFTO Form
     781 series forms are listed in T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance
     Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures. The aircraft maintenance
     organization and the owning organization determine what AFTO Form 781 series forms
     are appropriate for effective management of the APTA. Document maintenance actions
     per T.O. 00-20 series requirements. Use of unit operational Management Information
     System (CAMS, GO81) for APTA records management is recommended. Owning
     organizations not having logistics capability establish Host Tenant Support Agreements
     (HTSA) or MOAs assigning records management responsibility.
     11.5.3.5. Ensures timely completion of Time Compliant Technical Order (TCTOs) on
     systems designated for configuration management and proper configuration status
     accounting is maintained. Accomplish TCTOs on systems not designated for
     configuration management as required to ensure safety of operation.
     11.5.3.6. Ensures proper coordination and documentation of parts removed from
     permanently grounded aircraft are accomplished as follows:
         11.5.3.6.1. When an item is removed or replaced, the crew chief ensures this action is
         documented in the AFTO Forms 781 series. Include the authority for removal
         (message number, telecom, letters, and dates, etc.) and condition of
         installed/replacement items.
 40                                                       AFRCI24-101 3 DECEMBER 2012


          11.5.3.6.2. When limited save list actions have been completed, the owning
          organization must keep a copy of the list for historical records.
          11.5.3.6.3. Identify all unserviceable components furnished by Air Logistics Center
          (ALC) in a conspicuous manner (red X or red dot system).
          11.5.3.6.4. APTAs must be physically supported and secured to prevent the
          possibility of tipping due to loading/unloading operations (that is, milk stools, tail
          stands, ballast, blocks, or other physical restraints).
          11.5.3.6.5. Ensure operating and maintenance technical data are readily accessible
          whenever the APTA is in use or undergoing inspection. Use of an APTA G-file is
          required. G-files may be tailored depending on system capability for the training.
11.6. Operations.
   11.6.1. Use of an operator’s checklist during all phases of APTA operations is required.
   Checklists must be reviewed and approved as needed by a qualified loadmaster. Use the
   appropriate -9 series to assist with development of the checklist. Each checklist must reflect
   all usable systems that apply to the APTA assigned. The checklist must also contain all
   phases of operations: pre-operation, during operations, and post operation inspections.
   11.6.2. The operator must certify compliance with pre-, during-, and after-operations
   inspections using a log as referenced in paragraph 11.3.2.2. The APTA will not be used
   until all required APTA Supervisor inspections are completed and documented.
11.7. Disposition.
   11.7.1. Prepare and coordinate staff summary sheet locally and forward to the respective
   NAF/POC. As a minimum, the SSS will contain the following information:
       11.7.1.1. APTA’s MDS and serial number.
       11.7.1.2. Condition of the APTA (e.g. no wings, engines removed, electrical power,
       etc.).
       11.7.1.3. Location of the APTA.
       11.7.1.4. Name and organization of the APTA Custodian and APTA Supervisor.
       11.7.1.5. Reason for disposal.
       11.7.1.6. Earliest ready for disposal date.
   11.7.2. The NAF forwards SSS electronically to HQ AFRC/A4OS.
   11.7.3. The owning organization is responsible for funding and disposal of APTAs.
