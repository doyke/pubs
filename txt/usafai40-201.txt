  7.5. Radioactive waste.
16                                                        USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009


     7.5.1. Responsibility. Organizations possessing a valid radioactive material permit may
     generate radioactive waste during the course of their operations. Each organization shall
     assume full responsibility for collection, packaging, storage and disposal of radioactive
     waste generated. Each organization shall provide a secure, isolated area for temporary
     storage of its own waste, on-site, near the location where generated. Each site shall be
     approved by the USAFA RSO. When a container is filled and ready for disposal, the
     USAFA RSO shall be notified. The USAFA RSO or Permit RSO shall make
     arrangements for pickup of the waste by a disposal contractor authorized by AF
     Radioactive Waste Program Office or transferred to an authorized AF radioactive
     material permit. Contracts for pickup and disposal of radioactive waste shall NOT be
     made by the generator.
     7.5.2. Management of radioactive waste. To ensure safe handling of radioactive waste,
     the following guidance is provided. Any proposed deviations from this guidance must be
     submitted in writing to the USAFA RSO and approved prior to implementation.
     7.5.3. Generation of Waste. The primary goal of all users is to minimize the
     accumulation of radioactive waste. Do not combine radioactive and non-radioactive
     waste. Guidance may be obtained from the USAFA RSO. Most radioactive waste is
     generated in one of two ways:
        7.5.3.1. Routinely, such as in a research laboratory or medical treatment center.
        7.5.3.2. Infrequently, such as when a device used for many years is no longer
        required. In this case, the USAFA RSO should be contacted as soon as the item is
        identified as excess and the USAFA RSO shall provide specific directives for the
        proper management of the item. If the item is small, radiologically stable and
        presents no unusual hazard, the USAFA RSO may elect to assume responsibility for
        the item, consolidating it with other similar items for more efficient disposal. If this
        is the case, the USAFA RSO may store the items in a secure location until enough
        have accumulated to fill a shipping container.
     7.5.4. Segregation. Segregation is an important aspect of proper waste disposal.
     Commercial radioactive waste disposal facilities typically have extremely conservative
     segregation and disposal criteria.
        7.5.4.1. Solids from liquids. Examples are separation of solid check sources from
        liquid scintillation vials or separation of vials containing liquid scintillation fluid from
        surgical gloves, paper products and glassware that may be coated with the same fluid.
        7.5.4.2. High activity from low activity radionuclides. An example is separation of
        sources that are less than one millicurie from sources that are greater than or equal to
        one millicurie.
        7.5.4.3. Long half-life from short half-life radionuclides. An example is separation
        of sources that have half-lives less than 120 days from those that have half-lives
        greater than or equal to 120 days. Short half-life material may be decayed in storage
        and disposed of as non-radioactive waste if approved by the USAFA RSO in writing
        (paragraph 7.5.10).
USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009                                                                      17


        7.5.4.4. Different categories of material. An example is separation of alpha emitters
        such as plutonium and americium from gamma emitters such as cobalt and cesium.
        7.5.4.5. Chemical/biological waste from radioactive waste. An example is separation
        of radionuclides contained in animal carcasses from those contained in liquid
        scintillation vials.
     7.5.5. Containers. Radioactive waste shall only be collected in new or recently
     refurbished containers such as 55-gallon drums. A container should be chosen which can
     be filled in one year or less. The selected container must show no extensive signs of
     weathering or mishandling (i.e., no rust or dents) and must have no openings other than
     the top lid (i.e., no bung holes, even if sealed). If the container has a gasket on the lid, the
     gasket must be neoprene and no moisture is permitted inside the container. The National
     Stock Number (NSN) for an acceptable 30 gallon drum is 8110-00-866-1728 while the
     NSN for an acceptable 55 gallon drum is 8110-00-082-2626. If there are any doubts as to
     the acceptability of a container, contact the USAFA RSO.
     7.5.6. Liners. The container used for radioactive waste shall have two transparent
     plastic liners or one 8 mm liner installed. The liners shall be at least 4 mils thick and be
     appropriate in size for the container used. They shall be of sufficient length so that the
     top of each liner can be twisted into a tail long enough to be folded over onto itself and
     the inverted â€•Uâ€–-shaped end secured with duct tape. If there are any doubts as to the
     acceptability of liners, contact the USAFA RSO.
        7.5.6.1. Solids. If only solid waste is generated, the two plastic liners described
        above shall be placed one inside the other directly inside the container. Each liner
        shall be sealed individually resulting in a double encapsulation.
        7.5.6.2. Liquids. Liquids are not normally acceptable for radioactive waste disposal.
        Some liquids may be disposed of through the sanitary sewer; however, the decanting
        requirements must be satisfied. Other liquids such as contained in liquid scintillation
        vials are acceptable but must be collected separately from all other waste. The
        following is a summary of the procedures for packaging of liquid scintillation vials
        for disposal:
            7.5.6.2.1. For collection of liquid scintillation vials, the first liner shall be
            installed in the container, followed by at least 5 inches of absorbent material such
            as NSN 7930-00-269-1272. The amount of absorbent material must be sufficient
            to absorb twice the amount of liquid, however, DO NOT pour the liquid into the
            absorbent material, leave it in the vials. The second liner shall then be placed
            over this dry absorbent layer.
            7.5.6.2.2. The container shall consist of a drum, a plastic liner, a layer of
            absorbent material and finally a second liner. The waste is placed inside this
            second liner. If the waste consists of liquid scintillation vials, the intact vials shall
            be placed inside this inner liner. Once the inner liner is secured, another 5 inches
            of absorbent material shall be placed on top of this sealed inner liner before the
            outer liner is sealed. This top layer of absorbent material is intended to absorb the
            liquid should the drum be turned upside down. The reason for this procedure is
            that at the disposal site, the container and outer liner shall be opened and the inner
18                                                       USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009


            liner shall be removed from the container. Its contents shall then be placed in a
            machine that shall separate the liquid scintillation fluid from the vials. Therefore,
            no absorbent material or any other objects may be placed inside the inner liner.
     7.5.7. Inner Containers. As items are deposited in the radioactive waste drum, it is
     recommended that smaller transparent plastic containers be used to hold routine
     quantities of waste generated. For example, the waste generated each day during an
     experiment may be placed in a separate plastic container and sealed.
     7.5.8. Final Closure. When a container is full and ready for disposal, the USAFA RSO
     shall be notified. The USAFA RSO or representative shall visually inspect the container
     and shall initial the inventory sheets to indicate that proper procedures were followed.
     Since items packaged in the drum shall not normally be removed for a detailed inventory,
     the USAFA RSO shall not assume responsibility for problems arising as a result of
     incorrect inventories.
     7.5.9. Disposal to Sanitary Sewer. Liquid radioactive waste to be disposed through the
     sanitary sewer shall only be authorized by the USAFA RSO. The USAFA RSO shall
     review the types and amounts of material proposed for disposal and the procedures and
     shall verify that such disposal is authorized and does not exceed the maximum
     permissible quantities established in 10CFR20.2003. If such disposal is deemed
     acceptable, the USAFA RSO shall designate and label a drain approved for liquid
     radioactive waste and only this drain shall be used. Material shall be flushed with a
     continuous stream of water for the time indicated by USAFA RSO.
     7.5.10. Decay-In-Storage (DIS). DIS may be authorized by the USAFA RSO for all
     radioactive waste with half-lives less than 120 days. DIS is a procedure in which
     radioactive waste is placed in a storage container such as a drum and allowed to remain
     undisturbed for at least 10 half-lives. After the 10 half-lives have elapsed, the remaining
     activity shall be approximately one thousandth of the original activity but it must still be
     monitored by the USAFA RSO using an appropriately sensitive survey meter to ensure
     that no radiation above background is detectable. For DIS to be most effective,
     radioactive waste must be segregated according to half-life. Ideally, each container
     would contain only radionuclides with the same half-life. However, more realistically,
     the radioactive waste should be segregated into several categories according to half-life,
     such as, 1-15 days, 16-30 days, 31-45 days, 46-65 days, and 66-120 days.
     7.5.11. Incineration. Authorization to incinerate can only be granted by the RIC
     through the USAFA RSO and must be specified as a condition to a USAFA radioactive
     material permit before it can be accomplished. Incineration shall normally only be
     approved for cases where disposal to a commercial radioactive waste burial site is
     difficult   or   impossible     such     as for   animal   carcasses   or   mixed
     chemical/biological/radioactive waste where the incineration of the chemical and
     biological components is not restricted.
     7.5.12. Specific Waste. The NRC has authorized the disposal of some small quantities
     of radioactive waste as normal waste. This authorization applies only to carbon-14 (C-
     14) and hydrogen-3 (H-3), also known as tritium. Specifically, 10 CFR 20.2005, states
     that C-14 and H-3 may be disposed of without regard to radioactivity, if the amount is
     less than or equal to 0.05 micro curie per gram of medium used for liquid scintillation
USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009                                                                 19


      counting or per gram of animal tissue averaged over the weight of the entire animal. This
      exemption does not eliminate the requirement to dispose of the scintillation fluid and
      carcasses according to applicable chemical and biological waste disposal instructions. In
      addition, the instruction requires records of the amount disposed be maintained to ensure
      compliance.
      7.5.13. Records. Every item that is placed into a waste disposal container, flushed down
      an approved drain, incinerated or allowed to DIS, shall be recorded. A separate form
      shall be maintained by the generator for each container, each drain, and each incinerator
      and all of the columns listed on the form shall be completed. If inner containers are used
      they should be numbered consecutively and the inventory should indicate into which
      inner container each item of waste was placed. When a container is ready to be sealed for
      disposal or DIS, the USAFA RSO shall be informed.
8. Ionizing Radiation Producing Devices.
   8.1. All workplaces utilizing ionizing radiation producing devices shall have and implement
   written operating and safety procedures. These procedures shall be made available to each
   individual operating a radiation-producing machine.
      8.1.1. These procedures shall be reviewed annually.
      8.1.2. Medical operating and safety procedures shall cover the requirements in AFI 48-
      148, Ionizing Radiation Protection, chapter 4.
   8.2. All medical departments using radiation producing devices shall implement a quality
   control program IAW AFI 48-148, Ionizing Radiation Program, paragraph 4.6.
9. Radiation Exposure Limits.
   9.1. Personnel Exposure. Personnel who work with radioactive material or radiation-
   producing devices may be exposed to radiation during the course of their employment. The
   goal of the radiation safety program at USAFA is to maintain all radiation exposures
   ALARA. However, it may be impossible to completely eliminate all radiation exposure.
      9.1.1. Dose Limits. Federal regulations (10 CFR Part 20) specify the maximum
      permissible dose limits for radiation workers, workers under 18 years of age, non-
      radiation workers (i.e., members of the general public) and embryo/fetus. See Tables 1,
      2, and 3 for maximum permissible dose limits for workers.

      *The whole body means, for purposes of external exposure, head, trunk (including
      male gonads), arms above the elbow, or legs above the knee. TEDE means total
      effective dose equivalent.

          The dose in any unrestricted area resulting from AF controlled radiation
          sources shall not exceed the limits specified above. The USAFA RSO shall
          be responsible for the assessment, either by measurement or calculation,
          that these dose limits are not exceeded and shall maintain such records for a
          period of three years. If integrated radiation levels could exceed these
          limits, the area must be restricted.

   9.2. Occupational Exposure of Fertile Females.
       9.2.1. Each female potentially occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation shall be
       informed by the USAFA RSO or a member of the staff of the risks to the unborn.
       9.2.2. A female military member shall, on becoming aware she is pregnant, notify her
       workplace supervisor or primary care manager. A non-military member should notify
       her workplace supervisor or primary care manager. A civilian womanâ€™s decision to
       declare her pregnancy is voluntary. Declaration of pregnancy shall be in writing and
       include the estimated date of conception.
           9.2.2.1. All pregnant radiation workers will be placed on the radiation dosimetry
           program by the USAFA RSO.
       9.2.3. The USAFA RSO may limit specific duties of a declared pregnant female who is
       occupationally exposed to radiation and who in the opinion of the USAFA RSO may
       receive a whole body exposure greater than 500 millirem per year, either in the course of
       routine duties or as a result of a credible accident involving the radioactive material or
       radiation-producing devices. The USAFA RSOâ€™s evaluation shall include consideration
       of the workplace and the source of radiation, the individualâ€™s past history of exposure to
       radiation as documented by personnel dosimetry records, current radiation measurements
       applicable to her specific tasks, current exposure histories of coworkers, and likely
       exposures that would be incurred in the event of a credible accident.
       9.2.4. If the USAFA RSO determines it is unlikely that the declared pregnant female
       would receive a total exposure during the term of the pregnancy (including the period
USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009                                                                  21


      preceding the confirmation of the pregnancy) in excess of 500 millirem, she may
      continue in her radiation-related duties. However, if the individual is not already on the
      AF personnel dosimetry program, she shall be enrolled for the duration of her pregnancy.
      Should exposure results indicate a trend which, if continued, could result in exceeding the
      500 millirem limit, a re-evaluation shall be made as to whether she should continue her
      radiation duties, be restricted from certain high risk duties, or be removed entirely from
      occupational exposure.
      9.2.5. Special consideration must be made when a declared pregnant workerâ€™s radiation
      duties involve the operation of high output sources or the use of unsealed radioactive
      material. Pregnant workers shall not continue in duties involving these sources without
      the concurrence of AFMOA/SG3PB. When a pregnancy is suspected and reported to the
      immediate supervisor, women working with such sources or materials shall receive a
      prompt evaluation by the USAFA RSO (within five workdays after receipt of the consult
      request) and, if warranted, actions such as restrictions or removal from the workplace
      may be taken even prior to confirmation of the pregnancy.
10. Dosimetry.
   10.1. Radiation Workers. Individuals who routinely work with or near sources of ionizing
   radiation may be designated as radiation workers by the USAFA RSO after an evaluation of
   the potential hazards. Radiation workers are issued radiation dosimeters which are
   exchanged either monthly or quarterly as determined by the USAFA RSO. In certain
   circumstances, radiation workers may also be issued self-reading pocket or digital dosimeters
   in addition to standard radiation dosimeters to permit immediate evaluation of a potentially
   hazardous radiation environment.
      10.1.1. AF radiation dosimeters shall only be issued to military or civilian government
      employees or contractors working with government owned and operated radiation
      sources. Contractors using contractor owned and operated radiation sources shall be
      required to provide dosimeters to their own personnel unless a fee for service agreement
      is reached with USAFSAM.
      10.1.2. The USAFA RSO and his/her staff are responsible for:
          10.1.2.1. Determining whether radiation monitoring is required.
          10.1.2.2. Determining the frequency of radiation monitoring.
          10.1.2.3. Issuing and exchanging radiation dosimeters.
      10.1.3. The supervisor, or designated radiation dosimeter monitor, of a newly assigned
      worker has the responsibility to request radiation monitoring for that individual.
      Monitoring shall be required if the worker shall be located in an area designated by the
      USAFA RSO as a potential radiation hazard area or if, because of the assigned duties, the
      individual is classified as a radiation worker requiring dosimetry.
      10.1.4. Each individual to be monitored shall be provided with a radiation safety briefing
      to include an explanation concerning proper wearing and storage of the dosimeter and the
      right to review the dosimetry results each month or quarter. The USAFA RSO shall
      ensure that each individual monitored is provided with the summary results of dosimetry
      (internal and external) annually on AF Form 1527-1.
22                                                         USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009


     10.1.5. The supervisor shall reinforce this information by introducing the dosimeter
     monitor who shall indicate the dosimeter storage location and describe the procedures for
     requesting a review of the dosimetry results maintained by the supervisor.
  10.2. Visitors. Visitors to any restricted areas shall be accompanied by persons
  knowledgeable about the protection and safety measures in the area and must be provided
  adequate information and instruction before entering the area. Visitors entering a radiation
  area or a high radiation area or that could incur a deep dose equivalent of greater than 10
  millirem shall be provided personnel monitoring devices. In those rare instances where it is
  essential for visitors to enter such restricted areas for brief periods and where they may
  receive greater than 10 millirem, the supervisor shall ensure that each visitor is provided with
  a self reading pocket dosimeter or other radiation monitoring device and that the following
  information is recorded and a copy provided to the USAFA RSO:
     10.2.1. Name.
     10.2.2. Organization/Address.
     10.2.3. Telephone No.
     10.2.4. Social Security Account Number (SSAN).
     10.2.5. Dosimeter Serial No.
     10.2.6. Initial and final dose readings (if direct reading).
     10.2.7. Date, time and duration of visit.
     10.2.8. If at all possible, prior coordination with the USAFA RSO concerning visitor
     access to restricted radiation areas should be accomplished.
  10.3. Reporting. Monthly or quarterly, as applicable, report of the exposures recorded on
  the dosimeters is published (AF Listing 1499, Occupational Radiation Exposure Report).
  This report is provided to the USAFA RSO who reviews the results to determine if the
  exposures recorded are in compliance with the ALARA program. After review of the report,
  the USAFA RSO forwards a copy to the supervisors of the personnel monitored. These
  results shall be available to radiation workers for review.
  10.4. Dosimeters. There are several types of dosimeters which may be issued and specific
  rules governing proper wear of dosimeters:
     10.4.1. Thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) badges are issued to monitor personnel for
     radiation exposure. There are three types of badges:
         10.4.1.1. The whole body badge is designed to measure the radiation exposure to the
         entire body. The badge should be worn at the location of highest expected whole
         body radiation dose. The whole body badge is typically worn somewhere between
         the waist and the shoulders. The badge will provide a measure of the radiation
         exposure to the internal organs and the gonads. If the individual normally faces the
         radiation source, the badge should be worn on the front. If the radiation source is
         routinely behind the individual, the badge may be worn on the back. It should always
         be worn so as to be exposed to the same radiation environment as the body.
USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009                                                                  23


         10.4.1.2. The collar badge is worn on the shirt collar. It is designed to measure the
         radiation exposure to the critical organs above the shoulders, i.e., the thyroid in the
         neck and the lens of the eye. When a protective shield such as a lead apron is worn,
         the collar badge is placed outside the protective shield not under it. Results are often
         reported as a â€•headâ€– dose.
         10.4.1.3. The extremity badge or finger badge is worn like a ring on a finger of the
         hand which is most likely to be exposed to the radiation. If the source of radiation is
         typically held in the hand, the ring should be worn with the top portion turned around
         facing the palm and the radiation. If the radiation originates from a remote source
         such as an x-ray diffraction unit and the hand is likely to be exposed from the back,
         the ring should be worn in the usual manner.
     10.4.2. If dosimeters are issued, a whole body dosimeter is always worn by a radiation
     worker. Any other badges issued are worn in addition to the whole body badge.
     10.4.3. All radiation badges shall be worn while working in a designated radiation use
     area. The badges shall be put on before beginning work and removed after leaving the
     radiation use area. When not being worn, the badges must be stored on a rack or board of
     some kind in a radiation-free environment along with a control badge. This location is
     normally called a â€•control board.â€– The control badge always remains on the control
     board. Badges must never be taken home or stored in any other location such as desk
     drawers or attached to lab coats. Badges should also never be worn when undergoing
     medical radiation procedures such as diagnostic x-ray or dental examinations, nuclear
     medicine evaluations or radiation therapy treatments.
     10.4.4. If a badge is lost or damaged an investigation will be performed by the USAFA
     RSO to estimate the exposure actually received during that monitoring period. The
     individual to whom the badge was issued shall be required to sign a statement explaining
     the circumstances of the loss or damage.
     10.4.5. In addition to routinely issued radiation monitoring badges, some activities of a
     high risk of a large exposure may also require the use of self reading pocket dosimeters or
     similar device.
     10.4.6. If anyone suspects that a dosimeter has been exposed either deliberately or
     unintentionally to radiation irrespective of whether it was being worn at the time or not,
     the supervisor and the USAFA RSO shall be notified immediately. The dosimeter shall
     be collected and delivered to USAFSAM for processing.
     10.4.7. In the event that the USAFA RSO is notified by USAFSAM that an overexposure
     may have occurred, the USAFA RSO shall immediately contact the Unit Commander and
     request the individual be removed from all duties involving potential radiation exposure
     until an investigation is completed. The USAFA RSO shall investigate suspected
     overexposures and provide a written report within seven days through the MAJCOM
     Bioenvironmental Engineer to USAFSAM and AFMOA/SG3PB. Similar procedures
     shall be followed if the USAFA RSO is notified by an individual, or suspects, that an
     overexposure may have occurred.
  10.5. Investigative Levels. In addition to federally imposed dose limits, the NRC has also
  recommended the adoption of investigation levels for radiation workers. These levels are not
 24                                                        USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009


   legal limits. They are values arbitrarily set at a percentage of the federally mandated limits to
   assist radiation safety program monitors to comply with the ALARA concept by anticipating
   potential difficulties and initiating corrective actions. USAFA investigative levels are listed
   in Table 4. The investigative level for areas not listed in Table 4 will be 10% of their dose
   limit. Investigations may also take place for exposures below these levels if trend analysis
   shows a significant exposure increase over baseline levels.
11. As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA).
   11.1. ALARA. The ALARA concept was developed in response to scientific evidence
   which suggests that no level of radiation exposure is entirely risk-free. It is a policy which
   states that although there are acceptable, conservative levels of radiation exposure specified
   by federal regulations which offer a low risk of adverse health effects compared to the other
   hazards of life and occupation, it is prudent to make every effort to reduce exposures to the
   lowest levels reasonably achievable. Individual and cumulative radiation exposures must be
   maintained as close to zero as possible given the type of activities involved, the state of
   technology, the risk to the individuals, and the benefit to society from the activity being
   accomplished. The guidance contained in this instruction provides the basis for conducting
   an effective ALARA program.

  11.2. ALARA Commitment. The radiation safety program at this installation is managed
  by the USAFA RSO and reviewed by the USAFA RSC for the Installation Commander.
  USAFA is committed to the concept of ALARA. The ALARA commitment is summarized
  below:
      11.2.1. Management (10 ABW/CC).
         11.2.1.1. The management of USAFA is committed to the ALARA program for
         maintaining individual and collective radiation doses ALARA. According to this
         commitment, USAFA has developed an administrative organization and written
         policies, procedures and instructions to promote the ALARA concept. The
         organization consists of the USAFA RSC and USAFA RSO.
         11.2.1.2. The management of USAFA shall authorize modifications to operating and
         maintenance procedures and to equipment and facilities if they shall reduce exposures
         unless the cost is considered unjustified.
      11.2.2. USAFA RSC.
         11.2.2.1. The USAFA RSC shall delegate authority to the USAFA RSO and Permit
         RSOs for enforcement of the ALARA program and shall support the RSOs when it is
         necessary to assert authority. If the USAFA RSC overrules a RSO, the facts and
         basis for such action shall be documented in the minutes of the USAFA RSC
         meeting.
         11.2.2.2. The USAFA RSC may require users to develop new procedures to
         implement the ALARA concept and shall review occupational radiation exposure
         records to ensure compliance with ALARA.
      11.2.3. USAFA RSO.
         11.2.3.1. The USAFA RSO shall thoroughly review the qualifications of each
         applicant for a USAFA radioactive material/radiation-producing device permit to
         ensure that the applicant shall be able to respond appropriately to maintain exposures
         ALARA.
         11.2.3.2. The USAFA RSO shall perform annual reviews of the radiation safety
         program and present the findings to the USAFA RSC.
         11.2.3.3. The USAFA RSO shall perform a quarterly review of radiation exposure
         records and records of radiation surveys and present the results to the USAFA RSC
         each quarter.
 26                                                        USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009


          11.2.3.4. The USAFA RSO shall ensure users, workers, and ancillary personnel are
          provided briefings describing the ALARA program at least annually.
          11.2.3.5. The USAFA and Permit RSOs shall encourage users to submit suggestions
          for improving health physics practices and increasing the effectiveness of the
          ALARA program and shall evaluate them with the goal of implementing as many of
          them as are considered acceptable and reasonable.
          11.2.3.6. The USAFA RSO shall investigate all deviations from ALARA and direct
          changes when appropriate.
      11.2.4. Users.
          11.2.4.1. Users shall provide the USAFA RSO with information concerning newly
          proposed uses of radioactive material or radiation-producing devices with sufficient
          lead time to adequately evaluate the proposal. Alternate approaches shall be
          considered in the interest of ALARA.
          11.2.4.2. Users shall explain the ALARA concept to individuals supervised by them,
          ensure that they understand the concept and are adequately trained for the task
          required and document the training.
      11.2.5. Radiation Workers.
          11.2.5.1. Workers shall be instructed annually in the ALARA concept and its
          applicability to work practices and conditions.
          11.2.5.2. Workers shall be advised of available recourses if they feel that the
          ALARA concept is not being implemented.
12. Training.
   12.1. Personnel requiring training in radiation safety commensurate with their duties may
   include:
      12.1.1. Users.
      12.1.2. Supervisors.
      12.1.3. Radiation monitors.
      12.1.4. Permit RSOs.
      12.1.5. Emergency response teams.
      12.1.6. Special inspection groups.
      12.1.7. Ancillary personnel (such as housekeeping) who may perform duties in areas
      where radioactive material or radiation-producing devices are used.
   12.2. Training shall be provided to individuals, who in the course of their duties, are likely to
   receive greater than 100 mrem in a year:
      12.2.1. Before the individual is permitted to assume duties with or near radiation sources.
      12.2.2. Annually during a refresher training course.
      12.2.3. When there is a significant change in duties or radiation safety requirements.
USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009                                                                   27


   12.3. Training shall be provided by:
      12.3.1. The USAFA or Permit RSOs, according to the above schedule.
      12.3.2. The Public Health Flight, Occupational Health (10 AMDS/SGPM) during
      occupational safety briefings to workers. The contents of these briefings as they relate to
      radiation safety shall be approved by the USAFA RSO.
   12.4. Training sessions should include but are not limited to the following:
      12.4.1. Applicable regulations and permit conditions.
      12.4.2. Areas where radiation sources are used or stored.
      12.4.3. Potential hazards and health risks from the radiation sources.
      12.4.4. Appropriate radiation safety procedures.
      12.4.5. Work rules pertaining to radiation sources.
      12.4.6. Employee obligation to report unsafe conditions or practices.
      12.4.7. Initial response procedures to radiation emergencies.
      12.4.8. Employee right to be informed of occupational radiation exposure results.
      12.4.9. Location where pertinent regulations and documents are available for review.
      12.4.10. Workplace specific practices and procedures to ensure personnel exposures are
      maintained ALARA.
   12.5. All radiation safety training shall be documented and copies maintained by USAFA
   RSO or Permit RSO, as appropriate for a period of 5 years. When such training is required
   under this section, workplace supervisors shall ensure it is documented on each individualâ€™s
   AF Form 55, Employee Safety and Health Record.
13. Designation of Areas and Posting Requirements.
   13.1. â€•Restricted areaâ€– means any area, access to which is limited for the purpose of
   protecting of individuals against undue risks from exposure to radiation and radioactive
   material. Restricted areas shall be delineated and have access control.
   13.2. â€•Radiation areaâ€– means an area, accessible to individuals, in which radiation levels
   could result in an individual receiving a dose equivalent in excess of 0.005 rem in 1 hour at
   30 centimeters from the radiation source or from any surface that the radiation penetrates.
   Radiation areas shall be posted with a sign that includes a magenta or black radiation symbol
   on a yellow background and the words â€•Caution, Radiation Areaâ€–, with the exception of
   medical x-ray facilities and rooms otherwise excepted IAW 10 CFR 20.1903.
   13.3. â€•High radiation areaâ€– means an area, accessible to individuals, in which radiation
   levels could result in an individual receiving a dose equivalent in excess of 0.1 rem in 1 hour
   at 30 centimeters from the radiation source or from any surface that the radiation penetrates.
   High radiation areas shall be posted with a sign that includes a magenta or black radiation
   symbol on a yellow background and the words â€•Caution, High Radiation Areaâ€–, with the
   exception of medical x-ray facilities, and rooms otherwise excepted IAW 10 CFR 20.1903.
 28                                                       USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009


   13.4. â€•Very high radiation areaâ€– means an area, accessible to individuals, in which radiation
   levels could result in an individual receiving an absorbed dose in excess of 5 Gy (500 rads) in
   1 hour at 1 meter from a radiation source, shall be designated a very high radiation area. All
   such areas shall be posted with a sign that includes a magenta or black radiation symbol on a
   yellow background and the words â€•Grave Danger, Very High Radiation Areaâ€–, with the
   exception of medical therapy facilities, and facilities otherwise excepted IAW
   10CFR20.1903.
   13.5. The limits in the above definitions are specified in terms of â€•rem in one hourâ€– not â€•rem
   per hour (rem/hr).â€– The difference between these two expressions is significant. If the limit
   was expressed as 0.005 rem/hr, then any measurement with a survey meter above 0.005
   rem/hr would classify the location as a radiation area. However, when expressed as 0.005
   rem in 1 hour, a measurement of 0.01 rem/hr could still be classified as a non-radiation area
   if the occupancy were limited to no more than 30 minutes each hour or if the radiation field
   were present for no more than 30 minutes each hour. Such might be the case for an x-ray
   operation. Therefore, the classification of a radiation area must also consider the occupancy
   of the area and the duration of the radiation exposure.
   13.6. Permitted radioactive materials. Except as otherwise specified, copies of this
   instruction, 10 CFR Part 19 and Part 20, applicable AF permit, permit conditions, documents
   referenced in the permit and NRC Form 3, Notice to Employees, shall be posted in at least
   one conspicuous location within each work area where activities involving the use of
   radioactive material are conducted.
      13.6.1. Alternative Posting. If posting of a document specified above is not practical,
      with the exception of NRC Form 3, a notice may be posted which describes the document
      and states where it may be reviewed. Copies of the references listed in this instruction
      and other pertinent documents concerning the use of radioactive material are maintained
      by the USAFA RSO in building 2355 at 333-4825. The notice shall state that the
      documents are available for review during normal duty hours.
   13.7. Radiation Exposure Posting. The AF Listing 1499 lists each individualâ€™s radiation
   exposure record. This form is provided to supervisors at the end of each monitoring period
   and should also be made available for review. The AF Form 1527-1 lists each individualâ€™s
   annual dose and shall be made available for review by each employee.
14. Emergency Procedures.
   14.1. Emergency Situations. Potential radiation hazards may include:
      14.1.1. Spills of radioactive material. Spills pose a hazard because of the potential for:
      contamination of the environment; contamination of the skin of personnel; ingestion or
      inhalation of radioactive material; production of a high radiation field which may result
      in a radiation dose exceeding permissible limits even if the individual does not become
      externally contaminated.
      14.1.2. Production of a radiation field by an x-ray machine, irradiator, accelerator or
      radioactive material (even if the material is completely contained). An x-ray machine,
      radioisotope irradiator, or accelerator may be emitting radiation when it is supposed to be
      off or it may be emitting radiation into an area where it is not expected.
USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009                                                                  29


  14.2. Generic Emergency Response Procedures.
     14.2.1. The primary concern is first, the protection of individuals in the vicinity
     including emergency response personnel and second, the protection of the environment.
     Lifesaving activities always take priority over other considerations. Relatively large
     personnel exposures may be permitted for lifesaving procedures. Essential first aid
     always takes precedence over decontamination.
     14.2.2. Radioactive Material Spills. The material must be confined (preferably
     shielded) to prevent further contamination and individuals/environment may require
     decontamination.
        14.2.2.1. Prepare for a spill by having a â€•spill kitâ€– readily available complete with all
        of the items required to respond.
        14.2.2.2. Advise all personnel not directly involved with the initial spill incident or
        the subsequent cleanup to evacuate the area. Anyone suspected of being
        contaminated during the incident or cleanup should not leave the area until monitored
        and decontaminated if necessary.
        14.2.2.3. One individual should assume responsibility for immediate actions. The
        individual who starts giving commands should continue to do so until a more
        qualified and knowledgeable individual arrives on scene.
        14.2.2.4. Stop the spill if possible. The benefit of performing this activity must be
        balanced by the risk to the individual performing it.
        14.2.2.5. Warn individuals not involved in the spill to evacuate the area. Designate
        someone to call for assistance. Call the USAFA RSO and others, such as the
        supervisor, radiation monitor, or emergency response teams (e.g., fire department or
        ambulances) as required. The USAFA RSO shall ensure that all notifications
        required by AFI 40-201 and 10 CFR 20.2201 and 20.2202, are accomplished.
        14.2.2.6. Determine extent of the spill. If liquid or solid, try to mark boundaries. If
        gas, mark which areas are affected.
        14.2.2.7. Secure non-filtered exhaust and any other pathways outside the area (e.g.,
        air vents, windows, drains, etc.).
        14.2.2.8. Consider the need for internal evaluation (i.e., bioassay sampling such as
        urine, feces, nasal swabs, etc.). Bioassay samples are best collected immediately
        (provided external contamination of the sample is not a problem) and again after 24
        hours. The USAFA RSO shall provide guidance on follow-up sampling intervals.
        14.2.2.9. For fires, water should be used sparingly since it may tend to spread
        contamination.
        14.2.2.10. Radioactive material not involved in the incident should not be moved.
        Transporting sources to an alternate storage location during an incident to safeguard
        them is not recommended.
        14.2.2.11. After the cleanup has been completed, a report of the incident shall be
        prepared as directed by the USAFA RSO and a copy submitted to the USAFA RSC.
 30                                                       USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009


      14.2.3. Radiation Fields.
          14.2.3.1. For radiation fields, individuals must be removed from the radiation field or
          the radiation source must be shut down (e.g., turning off the x-ray machine or
          shielding the irradiator source).
          14.2.3.2. One individual should assume responsibility for immediate actions.
          14.2.3.3. Warn others of the problem and send for assistance from the USAFA RSO
          and others.
          14.2.3.4. Isolate the area by closing doors or setting up improvised barriers to prevent
          entry. Be certain that no one is in the area before securing it.
          14.2.3.5. After the situation has been corrected, a report of the incident shall be
          prepared as directed by the USAFA RSO.
15. Reporting Requirements.
   15.1. Mishaps, Incidents, and Accidents. Any abnormal occurrence involving radioactive
   material or radiation-producing device shall be reported by the using organization to the
   USAFA RSO immediately after the abnormal occurrence becomes known. Based on the
   severity of the occurrence, as specified in AFI 40-201, the USAFA RSO shall notify the
   following:
      15.1.1. 10 ABW/CC, HQ USAFA/JA, HQ USAFA/PA, HQ USAFA/SE.
      15.1.2. AFMOA/SGP3R.
      15.1.3. HQ USAF/SGOE.
      15.1.4. 10 MDG/CC.
      15.1.5. Other interested organizations with jurisdiction such as US Environmental
      Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration or State of Colorado.
   15.2. Notice of Violation or Hazard.
      15.2.1. Any worker or representative of workers who believes that a violation of NRC or
      AF instructions or permit conditions has occurred, or that any defect in facilities or
      equipment exists which may pose a hazard to personnel or the environment shall report
      such conditions to:
          15.2.1.1. The immediate supervisor, Permit RSO, USAFA RSO, branch or division
          chief, or department chairperson.
          15.2.1.2. The USAFA RSO at 333-4825. In absence of the USAFA RSO, reports
          may be made to the Chairperson of the USAFA RSC.
      15.2.2. Initial reports may be submitted verbally; however, a written report shall be
      submitted within five workdays for proper documentation (AF Form 457, USAF Hazard
      Report, may be used). The willful failure to report such violations or hazards to
      personnel in accordance with procedures provided in this section may be considered a
      dereliction of duty and could result in disciplinary action.
      15.2.3. Requests for inspection of violations or defects involving radioactive material
      possessed under authority of an NRC license or AF radioactive material permit may be
USAFAI40-201 20 OCTOBER 2009                                                                31


      made to the Installation IG or directly, in writing, to the AF RIC, AF IG, or the NRC
      Office of Inspection and Enforcement, Region IV, according to l0 CFR 19.16(a). In
      almost all cases, the AF RIC should be notified first.
16. Radon.
   16.1. Radon Limits. USEPA standards for exposure to radon are applicable to residential
   and non-residential structures on USAFA. Newly constructed or acquired structures shall be
   assessed by the USAFA RSO for exposure to radon progeny, with the exception of hangars,
   maintenance bays, dedicated storage facilities, structures occupied less than four hours per
   day, temporary facilities and elevated structures with unobstructed air flow underneath.
   Tests shall be performed not earlier than one year after construction using long-term
   monitors. Structures identified with radon concentrations greater than 4.0 picocuries/liter
   shall be remediated by CE. Structures that have been mitigated shall be reassessed by the
   USAFA RSO within six months.

Radioactive Materialâ€”includes any item that emits radiation without external power.
Examples are byproduct, source and special nuclear material as defined in the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR), Title 10, Parts 30, 40 and 70. Products distributed as exempt by a
manufacturer licensed to distribute to exempt persons do not require a permit, if used for their
intended purpose. Any unusual activities involving these sources, such as attempting to remove
the radioactive material from the item or accumulating large quantities of these items for storage
may require a permit. Although there are no administrative controls over these items, they may
require controlled disposal. If there is any doubt as to the requirement for a permit or the proper
method of disposal, contact the USAFA RSO for guidance.
Radiation Producing Deviceâ€”is any piece of equipment that emits ionizing radiation,
regardless of intent, when energized by an external power source. Examples include medical and
industrial x-ray machines, x-ray diffraction and fluorescence units, scanning and transmission
electron microscopes and particle accelerators. In general, any device that accelerates electrons
or other atomic particles with a potential difference of 10,000 volts or greater and produces x-
radiation, either intentionally or unintentionally, may require a USAFA radiation-producing
device permit. Some exceptions are television monitors, cathode ray tubes and video display
terminals which are manufactured under the strict requirements of 21 CFR 1020.10. If there is
any doubt as to the requirement for a permit, contact the USAFA RSO for guidance.
Radiation Workerâ€”An individual who may be occupationally exposed to measurable radiation
in the course of their duties or designated by the IRSO. This includes flight crews that routinely
fly average flight profiles that are equal to or greater than 40,000 ft. This does not include
workers who only work with Generally Licensed Devices such as explosives detection
equipment and other instruments or articles.
