minimum to unit personnel. EM representatives, at a minimum, will distribute information
provided by the R&EM flight for their information program. EM representatives may also
deliver additional education via commander’s call, squadron training days, or supplement with
learning materials about their own unit specific EM procedures.
6.7.3.2.1. (Added) Document unit EM information dissemination by using automated data
processing systems, locally developed products, or MFRs. Minimum information will include
date, subject(s) discussed, and who received the information. Keep these records in the Unit EM
continuity binder, Tab E: EM Unit Information Program. If an automated system is utilized,

Terms
Accountable Forms—Forms that the Air Force stringently controls and which cannot be
released to unauthorized personnel, since their misuse could jeopardize DOD security or result in
fraudulent financial gain or claims against the government.
Administrative Change—Change that does not affect the subject matter content, authority,
purpose, application, and/or implementation of the publication (e.g., changing the POC name,
office symbol(s), fixing misspellings, etc.)
Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program—The single, integrated Air Force
program to coordinate and organize efforts to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover from, and
mitigate the direct and indirect consequences of an emergency or attack. The primary missions of
the Air Force EM program are to (1) save lives, (2) minimize the loss or degradation of
resources, and (3) continue, sustain, and restore combat and combat support operational
capability in an all-hazards physical threat environment at Air Force installations worldwide. The
ancillary missions of the Air Force EM program are to support homeland defense and civil
support operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities IAW DOD
directives and through the appropriate Combatant Command. The Air Force EM program is
managed by the Office of The Civil Engineer, AF/A7C.
Approval Authority—Senior leader responsible for contributing to and implementing policies
and guidance/procedures pertaining to his/her functional area(s) (e.g., heads of functional two-
letter offices).
Authentication—Required element to verify approval of the publication; the approval official
applies his/her signature block to authenticate the publication. The signature block includes the
official’s name, rank, and title (not signature).
CBRN—Operations that include chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear, either
individually or in combination. Collectively known as WMD, CBRN replaces ― “NBC” when
used in reference to operations or incidents limited to NBC-only issues. TIC/TIM and HAZMAT
are considered part of the ― “C” in ―”CBRN”.
AFI10-2501_35FWSUP 29 APRIL 2014                                                                 17


CBRNE—Operations or incidents involving chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and
high-yield explosives, either individually or in combination. ― “CBRNE” is used anytime that
reference is not being made to WMD operations or incidents.
Command Post (CP)—A unit or sub-unit’s headquarters where the commander and the staff
perform their activities. In combat, a unit or sub-unit’s headquarters is often divided into
echelons.
Disaster Response Force (DRF)—The Air Force structure that responds to disasters or
accidents, establishing C2 and supporting disaster operations.
Emergency Operations Center (EOC)—For the purposes of AFIMS, the EOC is the C2
support elements that directs, monitors, and supports the installation’s actions before, during, and
after an incident. The EOC is activated and recalled as necessary by the Installation Commander.
The EOC updates the ICC with ongoing incident status and seeks support through the ICC when
on-scene requirements surpass the installation’s inherent capability and the installation’s
cumulative capabilities acquired through MAAs. EOCs may also support MCS and joint
information activities. According to the NRP, the EOC is defined as ―“The physical location at
which the coordination of information and resources to support attack response and incident
management activities normally takes place. An EOC may be a temporary facility or may be
located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at a higher level of
organization within a jurisdiction. EOCs may be organized by major functional disciplines such
as fire, law enforcement, and medical services, by jurisdiction such as Federal, State, regional,
county, city, tribal, or by some combination thereof”.
Emergency Support Function (ESF)—ESFs are groupings of capabilities into an
organizational structure that provides the support, resources, program implementation, and
services that are most likely to be needed during an incident. ESFs also serve as the primary
operational-level mechanism that provides support during an incident.
Major Accident—An accident involving DOD materiel or DOD activities that is serious enough
to warrant response by the installation DRF. It differs from the minor day-to-day emergencies
and incidents that installation agencies typically handle.
Major Disaster—As defined by the Stafford Act, any natural catastrophe (including any
hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, tidal wave, tsunami, earthquake,
volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm, or drought) or, regardless of cause, any fire,
flood or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the President
causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major disaster assistance under
this act to supplement the efforts and available resources of States, local governments, and
disaster relief organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused
thereby.
Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP)—A flexible system of protection against
nuclear, biological, and chemical contamination. This posture requires personnel to wear only
that protective clothing and MOPP equipment appropriate to the threat level, work rate imposed
by the mission, temperature, and humidity.
Personal Protective Equipment(PPE)—Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is equipment
designed to protect individuals exposed to hazards from injury or illness in non-military-unique

occupational environments where OSHA or applicable AFOSH standards apply, including
emergency response to CBRNE incidents in the United States.
Specialized Teams—The teams formed from the existing installation and unit personnel
resources to support emergency response operations. For the purposes of this AFI, emergency
response support teams that are part of the DRF include the EMST, SMTs, CCA teams, CCTs,
and PAR teams. Other teams that support emergency response, but have functional
responsibilities beyond emergency response, are not considered part of the DRF. Examples of
such teams are Search and Recovery or Crash Recovery.
