any means) into the following transitory holding categories: flammables and combustibles,
corrosives, non-flammable gas, and general hazardous materials. When a container is not
labeled, personnel will contact the 325th LRD for acceptance approval. Manufacturer/Vendor
items must have proper labels affixed to all hazardous items when received. Personnel will
submit Supply Discrepancy Reports for material received without proper labeling as well as
property received that is over, short, damaged, or misidentified. Property is held in transitory
holding areas during receipt processing. Transitory hold areas must be approved by Tyndall’s
Health, Safety, and Fire Department officials and approval correspondence will be posted in the
holding area. The maximum time hazardous items may remain in the transitory holding area is
two work days. When items cannot be processed within this timeframe, they are suspended in
stock and moved to the commensurate hazardous storage facility: Warehouse 03C – Corrosive
Storage, Warehouse 03B - Non-flammable Gas, Warehouse 03E - Flammable Storage, or
Warehouse 10A – General Hazardous Material Storage, until processing discrepancies are
resolved.    In all cases, hazardous material is handled with utmost care to prevent
package/container damage, leaks, ruptures or spills. All packages/containers are initially
inspected for leaks and when found the packages/containers are opened, inspected, and re-
packaged by an inspector. Leaking or damage containers are contained by spill containment
procedures and ultimately disposed. Hazardous material receipts are expeditiously processed in
base supply and the environmental hazardous material computer tracking system. Transitory
holding areas are equipped with Personnel Protective Equipment (PPE) necessary to afford
personnel safety while performing tasks associated with handling and transporting hazardous
materials. PPE includes rubber gloves, boots, aprons, face shields, eye wash stations, and spill
containment kits.
