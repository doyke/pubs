SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change deletes Chapter 1 list of references which is redundant with Attachment 1,
clarifies minimum altitude requirements for A-10C test and WIC TGP operations, removes the
special use airspace restriction for full switchology simulated air-to-surface weapons
employment, removes the requirement to visually inspect aircraft in the flight after the cold
trigger & pickle check, and adds ground visual signals to augment AFI 11-218 which were
inadvertently omitted from the original AFI. A margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

                                           Chapter 2

                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by all flight
members as well as the ops and intel functions in the unit.
2.2. General Procedures. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission
accomplishment to include fuel requirements, map preparation and takeoff/landing data.
   2.2.1. In addition, consult the following for mission planning:
       2.2.1.1. AFI 11-202V3
       2.2.1.2. AFI 11-214.
   2.2.2. Standards. The Squadron Commander (SQ/CC) is the approval authority for squadron
   standards. Ops Group Commander (OG/CC) may publish and approve group or wing
   standards. Ops Group Stan/Eval (OGV) will review all standards for compliance with AFI
   11-series guidance.
   2.2.3. Fuel Conservation. Aviation fuel is a limited commodity and precious resource.
   Consider fuel efficiency throughout all phases of mission planning and execution. Design
   flight plans and routing for optimal fuel use. Consider in-flight procedures such as
   climb/descent profiles and power settings for efficient fuel usage.
2.3. Map/Chart Preparation:
   2.3.1. Local Area Maps. A local area map is not required if pilot aids include jettison areas,
   divert information, controlled bail-out areas and provide sufficient detail of the local area to
   remain within assigned training areas.
   2.3.2. VFR navigation above 3000 ft AGL. Flight Information Publication (FLIP) enroute
   charts may be used instead of maps on navigational flights within areas adequately covered
   by these charts.
   2.3.3. Low Altitude Map Requirements. During low altitude segments of a flight (below
   3,000 feet AGL), each pilot must operate with at least one of the following maps available
   for all segments (either TAD or paper copy).
       2.3.3.1. Current sectional aeronautical chart.
       2.3.3.2. A current and CHUM updated (either ECHUM or manual) NGA map of the low
       altitude route/operating area. The map will be of such scale and quality that terrain
       features and required items displayed to allow navigation and safe mission
       accomplishment. The following items must be specifically displayed by the actual map
       or by other means (overlay, drawfile, handwritten, etc.): Airports/heliports, Special Use
       Airspace (SUAs) boundaries, ICAO class B/C/D boundaries, other airspace boundaries,
       MTRs, parachute jump and; and other potential high density traffic areas (flight activity
       areas and ultra light/hang glider/glider sites, etc.)
   2.3.4. Specifically developed low level route books require the previous items indicated
   within 5 nm of the route or MTR lateral boundary.
 8                                                          AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


     2.3.5. Use of electronic maps does not relieve pilots from their responsibility to thoroughly
     brief all routes, pertinent obstacles, applicable airfield approach control frequencies in the
     vicinity of class A/B/C/D airspace, intersection of other Visual Routes (VR)/Instrument
     Routes (IR) (if applicable), and any other possible areas of conflicts.
     2.3.6. Pilots flying outside CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM, theater or host nation
     guidance on mission planning. If no gaining MAJCOM, theater or host nation guidance
     exists, use the best available maps or electronic overlay options to accomplish the
     requirements of paragraph 2.3.3.2
2.4. Unit-Developed Checklist/Local Pilot Aids:
     2.4.1. Unit developed checklists of flight manual checklists may be used provided they
     contain, as a minimum, all items (verbatim and in order) listed in the applicable checklist.
     2.4.2. Locally developed pilot aids will be produced. As a minimum, include the following:
        2.4.2.1. Briefing guides.
        2.4.2.2. Local radio channelization and airfield diagrams.
        2.4.2.3. Impoundment procedures, emergency action checklists, and No Radio
        (NORDO)/divert information.
        2.4.2.4. Cross-country procedures to include: command and control, engine
        documentation, Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) samples, servicing, manual reversion
        ground checks and other information as deemed necessary by individual units (e.g.,stereo
        flight plans, turnaround procedures, local training areas and bailout/jettison areas).
        2.4.2.5. Other information as deemed necessary by the units (i.e. stereo flight plans, local
        training area diagrams, and local area maps of sufficient detail to provide situational
        awareness on area boundaries).
2.5. Mission Data Cards. Squadron-generated line-up cards may be used if they contain the
necessary information for the type of mission being flown. As a minimum, required items are:
     2.5.1. Callsign.
     2.5.2. Minimum Takeoff Landing Data (TOLD) requirements on Mission Data Cards are
        2.5.2.1. Acceleration check speed,
        2.5.2.2. Refusal/maximum abort speed (dry/wet),
        2.5.2.3. Takeoff speed/distance, and
        2.5.2.4. Normal/heavyweight landing distance (dry/wet).
     2.5.3. Joker and Bingo fuels will be annotated.
2.6. Preflight Brief.
     2.6.1. All flight members must attend the flight brief unless previously coordinated with unit
     supervisors.
     2.6.2. Anyone not attending the flight brief must receive, as a minimum, a brief on mission
     events and emergency procedures (EP) prior to step.
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                       9


   2.6.3. Flight leads/instructors are responsible for presenting a logical brief which will
   promote safe and effective mission accomplishment.
       2.6.3.1. Ensure brief start time provides adequate time to discuss required items and
       accounts for mission complexity. As a minimum, begin briefs at least 1.5 hours before
       scheduled takeoff. Alert briefs will start in sufficient time to be completed prior to
       aircrew changeover.
       2.6.3.2. Structure the brief to accommodate the capabilities of each flight member.
       2.6.3.3. Ensure contracts, roles, and responsibilities of each flight member are
       established, briefed, and debriefed.
       2.6.3.4. Review TOLD and ensure every member of the flight understands it. Place
       particular emphasis on takeoff abort factors during abnormal situations such as short or
       wet runway, heavy gross weights, and abort sequence in formation flights.
2.7. Alternate Mission Briefs. Brief an appropriate alternate mission for each flight.
   2.7.1. The alternate mission must be less complex than the primary mission (e.g. Basic
   Fighter Maneuvers as alternate for Air Combat Maneuvers, Basic Surface Attack for Surface
   Attack Tactics).
   2.7.2. If the alternate mission does not parallel the planned mission, brief the specific
   mission elements that are different.
   2.7.3. Mission elements may be modified and briefed airborne as long as flight safety is not
   compromised. Flight leads will ensure changes are acknowledged by all flight members.
   2.7.4. Do not fly unbriefed (either on the ground or in the air) missions or events.
2.8. Briefing Guides.
   2.8.1. Reference the attachments to this AFI for basic briefing guide examples.
   2.8.2. Subjects may be briefed in any sequence.
   2.8.3. Those items published in AFIs, AFTTP or unit standards and understood by all
   participants may be briefed as standard.
2.9. Multiple Sortie Days.
   2.9.1. If all flight members attend an initial or mass flight brief, the flight lead on subsequent
   flights need brief only those items that have changed from the previous flight(s).
   2.9.2. On multiple-go days when aircraft turn times do not allow follow-on mission brief(s)
   and only the initial flight brief is accomplished for all goes, the following guidance applies:
       2.9.2.1. Upgrade missions should be flown on the first sortie but may be flown on the
       second sortie if the first is non-effective for weather, maintenance, or airspace
       availability.
       2.9.2.2. Subsequent missions will be of equal or less complexity with no additional
       upgrade training, unless approved by OG/CC.
       2.9.2.3. Participants in continuation training (CT) missions may fly their primary or
       alternate missions in any sequence.

2.10. Postflight Debrief.
   2.10.1. All missions will be debriefed.
   2.10.2. All flight debriefs will include, at a minimum, the in-flight execution of flight
   member responsibilities, deconfliction contracts, tactical employment priorities, and task
   management.
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                   11


                                              Chapter 3

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Cockpit Preflight. Pilots will take special care when using and storing extra equipment in
the cockpit that is not part of the integral cockpit design. Pilots are to ensure the placement of
equipment is secured throughout all phases of flight, night or day, to prevent inadvertent contact
with crucial cockpit switches. Units will determine if an operational necessity exists for the NVG
case strap and remove the strap if it is not needed.
   3.1.1. Ground Visual Signals. Normally, pilot and ground crew will communicate by the
   intercom system during all Starting Engines, Before Taxi and End of Runway (EOR) checks.
   Use the intercom system to the maximum extent possible anytime maintenance technicians
   are performing "redballs" on the aircraft. The pilot will not activate any system that could
   pose any danger to the ground crew prior to receiving proper acknowledgment from ground
   personnel. When not using ground intercom, visual signals will be in accordance with AFI
   11-218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground, and this volume. The crew chief
   will repeat the given signal when it is safe to operate the system. The following signals
   augment AFI 11-218:
       3.1.1.1. Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Start. Pilot rotates three fingers above head in a
       circular motion.
       3.1.1.2. Flight Control Check. Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring motion.
       3.1.1.3. Trim Check. Pilot forms a "T" with hands: then raises one finger for elevator
       trim, two for an aileron trim, and three for rudder trim while each system is being
       checked for proper movement.
       3.1.1.4. Brake Check. Hold left or right arm horizontal, open hand and push forward,
       breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet).
       3.1.1.5. Slat Check. Pilot points to transducer vane.
       3.1.1.6. Gun/Armament Check. Point index finger forward with thumb upward
       simulating a pistol and shake head (Yes or No).
3.2. Starting Engines and Before Taxiing:
   3.2.1. Pilots will be cleared by the crew chief prior to starting the APU, engines or actuating
   primary or secondary flight controls.
   3.2.2. All flights require the bleed air function of the APU.
   3.2.3. Aircraft stall warning devices will be fully operational for all flights.
   3.2.4. In addition to the requirements of AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, as
   supplemented and FLIP, the following equipment will be operative if IMC is anticipated at
   any point in the flight:
       3.2.4.1. Tactical air navigation (TACAN).
       3.2.4.2. Heading attitude reference system (HARS).
       3.2.4.3. Standby attitude indicator.
 12                                                         AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


   3.2.5. Minimum required operational exterior lighting for night flying is: Landing and taxi
   light, both wingtip position lights, 1 out of 2 wingtip strobe anti-collision lights and at least
   one of the tail lights, either the fuselage tail position (stinger) light or strobe anti-collision
   light.
3.3. Taxi:
   3.3.1. Minimum taxi interval is 150 feet. Spacing may be reduced when holding short of or
   entering the runway.
       3.3.1.1. Minimum taxi interval is 300 feet at night, when carrying live bombs, and when
       operating on a Runway Conditions Reading (RCR) of less than 12.
   3.3.2. Quick Check and Arming. Place hands in view of ground personnel while the quick
   check inspection, arming/de-arming, and/or hot refueling are in progress.
   3.3.3. Do not taxi in front of aircraft being armed/de-armed with forward firing ordnance.
   3.3.4. When ice or snow is present, aircraft will not be taxied until all portions of the taxi
   route and runway have been checked for safe conditions. Units will specify minimum RCR
   for taxi operations.
3.4. Flight Lineup. Flights will line up appropriately based on weather conditions, runway
conditions and runway width. Spacing between separated elements/flights will be a minimum of
500 feet. If performing formation takeoffs, wingmen must maintain wingtip clearance with their
element leader. If runway width precludes line up with wingtip clearance between all aircraft in
the flight, use 500 feet spacing between elements or delay run-up until the preceding aircraft has
released brakes.
   3.4.1. Normally place wingman on the upwind side if the crosswind component exceeds 5
   knots.
3.5. Lineup Checks. After completing the “Lineup Checks” and prior to takeoff, all flight
members will inspect each other for proper configuration and any abnormalities. Wingmen will
indicate they are ready for takeoff by a head nod, radio call, or landing/taxi light signal as
briefed.
3.6. Takeoff:
   3.6.1. Do not attempt a takeoff if the RCR is less than 12 or as specified otherwise by
   MAJCOM.
       3.6.1.1. Per MAJCOM guidance, OG/CC may waive RCR minimum for specified units
       operating in cold weather locations, but in no case will takeoffs be conducted with an
       RCR of less than 8.
   3.6.2. On training missions, do not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of
   the available runway single ship, or 70 percent for a formation or rolling takeoff.
   3.6.3. If a VFR takeoff is required for mission accomplishment, the aircraft must be capable
   of achieving a minimum single-engine climb rate of 150 feet/minute (gear up, failed engine
   windmilling, flaps up, fuel flows normal, and all jettisonable stores-jettisoned), unless a
   higher rate of climb is required for unique obstacle clearance requirements. IFR takeoffs will
   be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V3. Aircraft operating under IFR that are unable to comply
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                    13


   with the required minimum climb gradients may be required to reduce fuel and ordnance
   loads, cart selected stores , or wait for environmental conditions to change. If operational
   requirements dictate, takeoffs may be made without a positive single-engine climb rate when
   approved by OG/CC
   3.6.4. If operational requirements dictate, intersection takeoffs may be approved by the
   OG/CC.
   3.6.5. Takeoff interval between aircraft/elements will be a minimum of 10 seconds except
   for chased takeoffs. When accomplishing a join-up on top or when carrying live ordnance,
   (excluding 30mm, rockets, flares or air-to-air missiles) increase takeoff interval to a
   minimum of 20 seconds.
   3.6.6. For rolling takeoffs, pilots will ensure the aircraft is aligned with the runway
   centerline prior to engaging anti-skid and advancing throttles. Only accomplish rolling
   takeoffs on icy runways or unimproved surfaces.
3.7. Formation Takeoff:
   3.7.1. Formation takeoffs are restricted to elements of two aircraft.
   3.7.2. A qualified flight lead will lead all elements unless an Instructor Pilot (IP), or flight
   lead qualified squadron supervisor, is in the element.
      3.7.2.1. Formation takeoff weather requirements are 300/1nm(1.6km) or Pilot Weather
      Category (PWC), whichever is higher
   3.7.3. Formation takeoffs will not be made when:
      3.7.3.1. Runway width is less than 140 feet.
      3.7.3.2. Standing water, ice, slush or snow is on the runway.
      3.7.3.3. RCR is less than 12.
      3.7.3.4. The crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.
      3.7.3.5. Computed takeoff roll in excess of 70 percent of available runway length.
      3.7.3.6. Loaded with live munitions (excluding 30mm, rockets, flares or air-to-air
      missiles).
      3.7.3.7. Ferrying aircraft from contractor/ALC facilities.
   3.7.4. Configure aircraft so as not to exceed an asymmetrical load moment of 12,000 foot-
   pounds.
      3.7.4.1. When asymmetrical loading is expected to create a noticeable rolling moment,
      the runway line-up will be such that both aircraft will not roll toward each other on
      liftoff.
      3.7.4.2. Formation takeoffs with aircraft not similarly configured can be made if the
      asymmetry in configurations include one of the following
          3.7.4.2.1. A rack plus practice bombs,
          3.7.4.2.2. A rocket/flare dispenser,
 14                                                        AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


           3.7.4.2.3. A TGM 65, or
           3.7.4.2.4. An air-to-air missile or an ECM pod (except ALQ-184).
   3.7.5. Differences in aircraft gross weight will not exceed 2,000 pounds. Takeoff data will be
   computed for the heavier aircraft.
   3.7.6. Formation Takeoff Procedures. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.A-10.
       3.7.6.1. On the flight lead's signal, set the core RPM at 90 percent or as briefed by the
       flight lead and check the engine instruments. In hot weather, 90 percent core RPM may
       not give predicted takeoff fan speed. In this instance, set one percent below predicted
       takeoff fan speed.
       3.7.6.2. Smoothly add power after brake release. If lead needs to reduce power for the
       wingman on takeoff, he will not reduce throttles beyond 3 percent below predicted
       takeoff fan speed or min/abort fan speed, whichever is higher.
       3.7.6.3. Maintain wingtip clearance throughout takeoff roll. If the wingman overruns the
       leader, the leader will direct the wingman to assume the lead, at which time the wingman
       will push up to MAX power, maintain his side of the runway, and make his own takeoff.
       The original leader will then be responsible for in-flight separation and directing
       appropriate measures to regain flight integrity or initiate lost wingman procedures. The
       original wingman will fly the briefed departure until instructed otherwise by the flight
       leader.
       3.7.6.4. Retract the gear after the flight leader observes the wingman to be safely
       airborne.
3.8. Join-up/Rejoin:
   3.8.1. Day weather criteria for a join-up underneath a ceiling is 1,500 feet and 3 miles.
       3.8.1.1. Flight leaders will maintain 200 KIAS until join-up is accomplished unless
       briefed otherwise.
       3.8.1.2. If accomplishing a turning join-up, the flight leader will normally not exceed 30
       degrees of bank.
       3.8.1.3. Flight members will join in sequence. For a straight ahead rejoin, the number
       two aircraft will join on the left wing and the element will join on the right wing unless
       otherwise briefed. For a turning rejoin, the number two aircraft will rejoin on the inside
       of the turn and the element to the outside. If mission or flight requirements dictate, the
       flight leader will specifically call and state the desired formation positions.
       3.8.1.4. For further join-up procedures, see paragraph 3.10 and Chapter 4.
3.9. Formation, General: Flight leads/IPs are responsible for ensuring contracts, roles and
responsibilities of each flight member are established, briefed, executed and debriefed. If any
flight member cannot fulfill their basic responsibilities, contracts, or other assigned tasks, they
will immediately communicate that information to the flight/element lead. IP/flight leads will
task element leads/wingmen based on their ability to fulfill basic responsibilities and other
assigned tasks. For additional formation considerations, reference AFTTP 3-3.A-10 and AFTTP
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                    15


3-1.A-10. Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) will not be used as the sole or primary
source of deconfliction.
   3.9.1. The flight lead will supervise formations. The flight lead retains responsibility for the
   flight regardless of which physical position he flies. Wingmen should have the situational
   awareness to be prepared to fly the number one position if, in the judgment of the flight lead,
   such action is warranted. The term element lead may be used to designate the number three
   aircraft in a flight of four—this, in itself, does not imply flight lead authority.
   3.9.2. Do not perform rolling maneuvers during join-up/rejoins to non-tactical formation.
   3.9.3. Do not perform rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain position below 5,000 feet
   AGL or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited.
   3.9.4. Airborne visual signals will be in accordance with AFI 11-205, Aircraft Cockpit and
   Formation Flight Signals. For four ship flights, initiate configuration changes by radio call,
   when practical. When formation position changes are directed by radio, all wingmen will
   acknowledge prior to initiating the change. A radio call is mandatory when directing position
   changes at night or under instrument conditions.
   3.9.5. Flight leaders will not break up formations until each pilot has a positive fix from
   which to navigate (visual, Air Traffic Control (ATC), EGI, or TACAN).
   3.9.6. In IMC, maximum flight size in close formation is four aircraft except when flying in
   formation with a tanker.
   3.9.7. Changing Leads. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.A-10.
      3.9.7.1. The minimum altitude for changing leads within a formation/element in day
      VMC is 500 feet AGL over land or 1,000 feet AGL over water, except for emergencies
      (for night see paragraph 3.19.4; for IMC, see paragraph 4.6).
      3.9.7.2. Prior to initiating the lead change, the leader will ensure that the wingman
      assuming the lead is in a position to safely initiate the lead change.
   3.9.8. Transitioning to instrument meteorological conditions (IMC):
      3.9.8.1. When flying in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) with a high potential for
      IMC, flight leads should place their formations in close, route, or trail. Avoid using
      wedge or fighting wing to skirt marginal weather.
      3.9.8.2. If loss of sight inadvertently occurs due to weather while in a VMC formation,
      the following applies:
          3.9.8.2.1. Maintain VMC if feasible; transmit “call sign, blind, altitude, and
          heading.”
          3.9.8.2.2. If unable to maintain VMC, immediately transition to instruments, recover
          to level or climbing flight, and execute the appropriate lost wingman procedures. The
          flight lead will ensure altitude separation between other aircraft in the flight until
          separate Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) clearances can be obtained.
          3.9.8.2.3. If unable to maintain VMC while low level, execute low level abort
          procedure while transitioning to instruments. See paragraph 3.17.16
 16                                                          AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


   3.9.9. Wingmen may practice low altitude tactical navigation (LATN) provided the route
   was thoroughly briefed and the flight lead maintains navigation situational awareness.
   Wingmen may lead portions of a mission provided an instructor pilot (IP) or flight lead
   qualified squadron supervisor is in the same element.
   3.9.10. Close Formation. Except for lazy-eight or chandelle-type maneuvers, close
   formation aerobatics will not be flown.
3.10. Tactical Formations:
   3.10.1. Tactical Maneuvering. Refer to AFTTP 3-1 AFTTP 3-3.A-10 and MAJCOM
   directives. The following rules apply for flight path deconfliction during tactical
   maneuvering:
      3.10.1.1. Flight/element leads will consider wingman/element position and ability to
      safely perform a maneuver before directing it.
      3.10.1.2. Wingmen/elements maneuver relative to the flight lead/lead element and
      maintain sight. Trailing aircraft/elements will be responsible for deconfliction with lead
      aircraft/elements. SADL may be used to augment situational awareness when flying
      tactical formations.
      3.10.1.3. Wingmen/elements go high and/or outside of the lead/lead element for
      deconfliction when required.
      3.10.1.4. For rejoins from tactical formation, the wingman will join to the side of the
      formation occupied at the time the rejoin is directed. If in trail, join to the left side. In all
      cases, the trailing element will join to the side opposite the number two, unless otherwise
      directed.
   3.10.2. Lost Visual Contact. The following procedures apply when one or more flight
   members/elements lose visual contact within the formation.
      3.10.2.1. If any flight member/element calls “blind,” then the other flight
      member/element will immediately confirm a “visual” with an informative/directive radio
      call.
      3.10.2.2. If the other flight member/element is also blind, then the flight lead will take
      action to ensure altitude separation based on the cockpit altimeter or sector deconfliction
      off a known point. Use a minimum of 500 feet altitude separation when directed to
      deconflict by altitude. Avoid climbs/descents through the deconfliction altitude. Low
      Altitude Safety and Targeting Enhancement (LASTE) HUD altimeter readings should not
      be used as the primary altitude reference for deconfliction due to the potential of
      significantly different altimeter readings if not operating in NAV mode. Once
      deconfliction is assured, pilots may use SADL to assist in regaining visual.
      3.10.2.3. If there is no timely acknowledgment of the original “blind” call, then the flight
      member/element initiating the call will maneuver away from the last known position of
      the other flight member/element and alter altitude.
      3.10.2.4. If visual contact is still not regained, the flight leader will take additional
      positive action to ensure flight path deconfliction within both the flight and the scenario
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                  17


      to include a “Terminate/Knock-It-Off,” as appropriate. Consider scenario restrictions
      such as sanctuary altitudes and/or adversary blocks.
      3.10.2.5. Aircraft will maintain altitude or sector separation until regaining visual and
      will continue to maintain this separation until regaining mutual support.
   3.10.3. Two-Ship. Normally, the wingman is responsible for flight path deconfliction. The
   flight lead has primary responsibility for deconfliction when:
      3.10.3.1. Tactical maneuvering places the leader in a position likely to cause the
      wingman to lose sight of the leader or forces the wingman's primary attention away from
      the leader (e.g., wingman becomes the defensive or engaged fighter).
      3.10.3.2. The wingman calls “padlocked.”
      3.10.3.3. The wingman calls “blind.”
      3.10.3.4. Primary deconfliction responsibility transfers back to the wingman once the
      wingman acknowledges “visual” on lead.
   3.10.4. Three/Four-Ship (or Greater). When flights of more than two aircraft are in tactical
   formation:
      3.10.4.1. Formation visual signals performed by a flight/element leader pertain only to
      the associated element unless specified otherwise by the flight leader.
      3.10.4.2. Trailing aircraft/element(s) will maintain a sufficient distance back so that
      primary emphasis during formation maneuvering/turns is on low altitude awareness and
      deconfliction within elements, not on deconfliction between elements.
3.11. Chase Formation. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.A-10.
   3.11.1. Restrictions:
      3.11.1.1. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or impending
      emergency conditions. Qualified pilots (pilots who have successfully completed an
      Instrument/Qualification evaluation including Initial Qualification Training (IQT)/
      Mission Qualification Training (MQT) pilots) may chase as a safety observer for aircraft
      performing simulated instrument flight, hung ordnance recovery, or simulated single
      engine patterns. All other chase events will be flown by flight examiners, IPs, Upgrading
      IPs supervised by an IP, or flight lead qualified squadron supervisors designated by the
      Squadron Director of Operations (SQ/DO).
      3.11.1.2. During takeoff, the chase aircraft will maintain a minimum of nose-to-tail and
      wing tip clearance. All formation takeoff restrictions apply except chased takeoffs may
      be accomplished if computed takeoff roll is in excess of 70 percent of available runway
      length and/or the crosswind or gust component exceeds 15 knots. Brief specific abort
      procedures.
      3.11.1.3. In flight, the chase aircraft will maneuver as necessary, but must maintain nose-
      tail separation. The chase will not stack below the lead aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL.
          3.11.1.3.1. When moving into or out of close formation from chase, the chase pilot
          will make a radio call indicating intentions. The call indicating a move to close
          formation will be acknowledged.
 18                                                       AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


       3.11.1.4. In the traffic pattern, the chase aircraft may maneuver as necessary to observe
       performance.
       3.11.1.5. Confidence Maneuver Chase. The chase pilot will fly a pattern well clear of the
       maneuvering aircraft's flight path. The chase aircraft will not perform the confidence
       maneuver simultaneously.
       3.11.1.6. When chasing live ordnance missions, the chase pilot is responsible for
       ensuring safe escape criteria is met.
       3.11.1.7. A safety observer in a chase aircraft will maneuver in an approximate 30 to 60
       degree cone with nose/tail clearance to 1,000 feet, to provide assistance and effective
       clearing.
3.12. Show Formation. Refer to AFI 11-209, Air Force Participation in Aerial Events, and
applicable MAJCOM directives for guidance. Specifically, brief these formations and fly them
IAW applicable directives and AFTTP 3-3.A-10. Wing/group commander approval is required.
3.13. Maneuvering Parameters:
   3.13.1. Use T.O. 1A-10A-1, T.O. 1A-10C-1, MAJCOM operating procedures, AFTTP 3-
   1.A-10, and AFTTP 3-3.A-10 to define and describe the performance of weapons deliveries,
   confidence maneuvers, aerobatics, Air Combat Training (ACBT), or advanced handling
   maneuvers.
   3.13.2. G-awareness exercise will be accomplished IAW AFI 11-214, gaining MAJCOM,
   theater and host nation guidance. Any mission that plans or is likely to maneuver in excess of
   five Gs will accomplish a G-awareness exercise IAW AFTTP 3-3.A-10. Missions planned at
   five Gs or less do not require this exercise. G-awareness exercise will be filmed and in Hot
   Mic.
       3.13.2.1. Unless performing a syllabus-required event (e.g. chase of a G-awareness
       exercise), flight members will maintain a minimum of 6,000 feet separation between
       aircraft during the execution of all G-awareness exercises. On board systems (e.g., air-to-
       air TACAN, data link) should be used to establish and maintain separation prior to
       maneuver execution. During maneuver execution use visual lookout and briefed
       formation contracts as primary means of ensuring aircraft deconfliction. If required, use
       on board systems to enhance situational awareness during the maneuver.
       3.13.2.2. G-awareness exercise is not required at night. If a G-awareness exercise is
       performed, pilots must have NVGs and enough visual cues to perform this maneuver.
       Flight leads will ensure spacing between elements is sufficient to maintain deconfliction
       between all flight members. Consideration should be given to splitting the elements for
       separate G awareness exercises.
       3.13.2.3. Flight/element leads will ensure the airspace intended for conducting the G-
       awareness exercise is free from potential traffic conflicts. Use air traffic control (ATC)
       services to the maximum extent practical to make sure the airspace is clear. Conduct the
       G-awareness exercise in the following airspace with preference to the order as listed:
          3.13.2.3.1. Special use airspace (e.g., Restricted/Warning areas, ATCAAs, MOAs
          and MAJCOM approved large scale exercise/special missions areas).
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                  19


           3.13.2.3.2. Above 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use airspace.
           3.13.2.3.3. Inside the confines of Military Training Routes.
           3.13.2.3.4. Below 10,000 feet MSL outside of Special Use Airspace.
   3.13.3. Minimum Altitudes:
       3.13.3.1. Confidence Maneuvers—Entry will be made at a minimum of 10,000 feet
       AGL.
       3.13.3.2. Do not perform aerobatics below 5,000 feet AGL.
   3.13.4. Vortices/Jetwash. Avoid flight through wing tip vortices/jetwash. If unavoidable,
   unload the aircraft immediately to approximately 1 G.
   3.13.5. Use of Flaps. Do not use flaps as an in-flight maneuvering aid in the conduct of
   aerial combat maneuvers. The Maneuver (MVR) position may be used in the landing pattern,
   when loitering, when escorting another aircraft, etc.
3.14. Ops Checks:
   3.14.1. Accomplish sufficient ops checks to ensure safe mission accomplishment. For
   formation flights, the flight lead will initiate ops checks by radio call or visual signal.
   Wingmen will respond by radio call or visual signal.
   3.14.2. Ops checks are required:
       3.14.2.1. During climb or at level-off after takeoff.
       3.14.2.2. When internal wing tanks or external fuel tanks (if carried) are empty. When
       internal wing tanks are dry, ops checks will include “wings dry.” When carrying external
       tanks, ops checks will include “tanks feeding” or “tanks dry” as appropriate. Once the
       external tank(s) and/or internal wing tanks are confirmed and called dry, omit this call
       from subsequent ops checks.
       3.14.2.3. After completing air refueling.
       3.14.2.4. Prior to each air to air engagement (Basic Fighter Maneuvers (BFM), Air
       Combat Maneuvering (ACM), and (Dissimilar) ((D)ACBT).
       3.14.2.5. Prior to commencing air-to-surface operations, at least once during air-to-
       surface operations, and after terminating air-to-surface operations.
   3.14.3. Do not use data linked fuel status as the primary reference for fuel checks. Data link
   may not display accurate fuel remaining and does not verify wing tank balance or status of
   forward/aft main tank balance problems.
3.15. Radio Procedures. Use the complete flight call sign anytime any flight member initiates
a radio transmission. In all other cases, an acknowledgment by flight position is sufficient. Use
“Knock It Off” (KIO) or “Terminate” procedures to direct aircraft to stop engagements,
scenarios and tactical maneuvering IAW AFI 11-214. All flight members will acknowledge by
repeating the call.
   3.15.1. Brief the use of backup/alternate radios within a flight and monitor closely. Use of
   these radios as an “intra-flight intercom” or for administrative information that should be
   held for debriefing is inappropriate and constitutes poor radio discipline.
 20                                                        AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


   3.15.2. The flight/mission leader will initiate all frequency changes with either the term
   “PUSH” or the term “GO.” If “PUSH” is used flight members will change to the new
   frequency without an acknowledgement. If “GO” is used each flight member will
   acknowledge, in turn, prior to any flight member switching frequencies. Flight/mission leader
   will initiate a radio check on the new frequency which will be acknowledged, in turn, by all
   flight members. EXCEPTION: During prebriefed radio silent training or limited comm
   operations, channel changes will be as briefed.
   3.15.3. Individual flight members, in turn, will acknowledge radio checks that do not require
   the transmission of specific data. Acknowledgment by the individual flight member indicates
   the initiation or completion of the appropriate check.
   3.15.4. In addition to the standard radio procedures outlined in AFI 11-202V3; Specific
   Mission Guides; and FLIP publications; the following radio transmissions are required:
      3.15.4.1. All flight members will acknowledge understanding the initial ATC clearance.
      Acknowledge subsequent ATC instructions when directed by the flight lead or anytime
      during trail departures.
      3.15.4.2. Gear down calls will be IAW AFI 11-202V3 and AFI 11-217V1, Instrument
      Flight Procedures. Wingman or chase aircraft are not required to make an individual gear
      down call during a formation of chased approach.
   3.15.5. When requiring simultaneous action by other flight members, the voice command
   will be followed by the word of execution “NOW.”
   3.15.6. Brevity code and other terminology will be IAW AFI 11-214, AFTTP 3-1, and
   AFJPAM 10-228.
3.16. Airborne Communications Jamming Procedures. Refer to AFI 11-214.
3.17. General Low Altitude Procedures:
   3.17.1. Fly low-level formation positions/tactics using AFTTP 3-1.A-10 and AFTTP 3-3.A-
   10 as guides.
   3.17.2. Fly line abreast formation at or above 300 feet AGL. When flying in formation
   below 300 feet AGL the wingman will be directed to a wedge, trail, or combat trail formation
   position. Training in the 300 to 100 feet AGL altitude block will be in short segments
   consistent with real-world risks and realistic tactical considerations.
   3.17.3. For air-to-surface range operations, minimum altitudes will be determined by
   area/range restrictions, AFI 11-214 restrictions or delivery restrictions, whichever is greater.
   “Show of Force” is not a weapons delivery maneuver and will be flown IAW the pilot’s
   minimum altitude, area/range restrictions or theater SPINs, whichever is higher.
   3.17.4. At altitudes below 1,000 feet AGL, wingmen will not fly at a lower AGL altitude
   than lead.
      3.17.4.1. Some formations will have flight leads LASDT certified lower than their
      wingmen. The flight lead that flies lower than other formation members will, prior to
      descending to their block, confirm their wingmen’s low altitude warning is set to their
      minimum altitude.
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                    21


  3.17.5. Flights operating in the low altitude environment will climb to a prebriefed safe
  altitude (minimum 1,000 feet AGL) when a Knock-It-Off is called.
  3.17.6. Navigate using a combination of pilotage, dead reckoning (DR) and Embedded
  GPS/INS (EGI) information. DR will be the primary means of navigation.
  3.17.7. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral separation from known vertical
  obstructions, which are a factor to the planned route or flight, flight leads will direct a climb
  to ensure vertical separation 2 NM prior to the obstacle.
  3.17.8. When crossing high or hilly terrain, do not exceed 120 degrees of bank. Limit zero or
  negative G crossings to upright bunting maneuvers that are within the zero/negative G
  limitations for the aircraft and external stores.
  3.17.9. Minimum flight planning airspeed for low altitude flight/navigation is 240 KIAS.
  Minimum airspeed during low altitude flight/navigation is 200 KIAS.
  3.17.10. For aircraft equipped with an operable radar altimeter, the system will be on and set
  at either the briefed minimum altitude or the command-directed low level altitude, whichever
  is higher.
  3.17.11. The unit commander, IAW AFI 11-2A-10, Volume 1, A-10—Aircrew Training, as
  supplemented, will determine and certify a pilot’s minimum altitude. Pilots participating in
  approved step-down training programs will comply with the requirements and restrictions of
  that program. Unless higher altitudes are specified by national rules, route restrictions, or
  training syllabus, the following minimum altitudes apply to low level training:
     3.17.11.1. 500 feet AGL for:
         3.17.11.1.1. Formal Training Unit (FTU) students and instructors when conducting
         training IAW an applicable syllabus.
         3.17.11.1.2. Pilots who have not entered step-down training or are not certified for
         flight at lower altitudes.
         3.17.11.1.3. Overwater flight if duration is more than 1 minute or if out of sight of
         land or if there is an indefinite horizon.
  3.17.12. Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) will provide a clearance of 1,000 feet above the
  highest obstacle/terrain feature (rounded to the next highest 100 feet) within 5 NM of the
  planned course, route boundaries, or operating area (e.g. military operating area (MOA), low
  fly area, restricted area, etc.). Pilots may compute an MSA for each leg/segment of the
  intended route of flight or for a specific target.
     3.17.12.1. For night (non-NVG) or IMC operations, the minimum altitude is MSA.
  3.17.13. When external tanks are installed, do not fly missions requiring tactical
  maneuvering at low altitudes. EXCEPTION: Low altitude tactical maneuvering within Dash
  1 limits is authorized with an installed centerline Sergeant Fletcher external tank.
  3.17.14. During all low altitude operations, the immediate reaction to task saturation,
  diverted attention, or an emergency, is to climb.
22                                                       AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


  3.17.15. Weather minimums for visual low-level training will be 1,500 feet and 3 miles, or
  as directed by Host Nation for any route or area or as specified in FLIP for Military Training
  Routes (i.e., 3,000/5 for VR routes), whichever is higher.
  3.17.16. Low-Level Route/Area Abort (RAA) Procedures. Compute and brief a low-level
  route abort altitude (RAA). The RAA will provide a clearance of 1,000 feet above the highest
  obstacle/terrain feature (rounded to the next highest 100 feet) within 5 NM of the entire
  planned course, route boundaries or operating area (e.g., MOA, low fly area, restricted area,
  etc.). Minimum airspeed for the route abort is 160 KIAS. Maximum pitch angle is 30 degrees
  nose high.
     3.17.16.1. VMC Route/Area Abort Procedures:
         3.17.16.1.1. Maintain safe separation from the terrain.
         3.17.16.1.2. Comply with VFR altitude restrictions and squawk appropriate
         (IFF/SIF) modes and codes.
         3.17.16.1.3. Maintain VMC at all times. If unable, follow IMC procedures outlined
         below.
         3.17.16.1.4. Attempt contact with controlling agency, if required.
     3.17.16.2. IMC Route/Area Abort Procedures:
         3.17.16.2.1. During low level flight, every safe effort will be made to avoid entering
         IMC. If IMC is encountered, pilots will transmit Call sign, knock-it-off and route
         abort.
         3.17.16.2.2. Immediately climb to, or above the briefed RAA. Transition to
         instruments if entering IMC.
         3.17.16.2.3. A route abort is an emergency procedure and pilot judgment is
         paramount. Flight leads will ensure safe separation while complying with local/host
         nation procedures. If deviation from local/host nation procedures is necessary to
         avoid a collision, the flight lead will direct the appropriate action.
         3.17.16.2.4. Maintain preplanned ground track. Execute appropriate lost wingman
         procedures if necessary. The flight/element leader is responsible for ensuring heading
         and/or altitude deconfliction during an IMC route abort procedure. Ensure
         deconfliction is based on the same altimeter setting.
         3.17.16.2.5. Use the current altimeter setting until changed by the flight lead and
         squawk emergency or in compliance with host nation procedures.
         3.17.16.2.6. If required to deviate from normal route/area procedures, or if the RAA
         is higher than the vertical limits of the route/area, squawk (IFF/SIF) emergency.
  3.17.17. Targeting Pod (TGP) Minimum Altitudes. These minimums apply to heads down
  operations while manipulating the TGP such as searching for targets through the MFCD.
  Minimum altitude for this type of TGP employment is 5,000 feet AGL, except when doing
  self-mark HAS with a base altitude above 5,000 feet AGL and recovery altitude IAW AFI
  11-214 minimums. Pilots who have completed the TGP LASDT upgrade may use the
  following minimum altitudes:
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                  23


      3.17.17.1. 1,000 feet AGL during day
      3.17.17.2. 2,000 feet AGL for night/high illumination
      3.17.17.3. 2,000 feet AGL or MSA, whichever is higher, for night/low illumination
      3.17.17.4. AWFC, Test and AATC: Minimum altitudes for TGP operations are
      established in WIC or test syllabus requirements, continuation training plans or
      operational test and evaluation requirements.
   3.17.18. Use of TGP LSS/LST capability below altitudes prescribed in paragraph 3.17.17
   above is limited to HOTAS actions required to initiate and display LSS/LST symbology in
   the HUD or Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS).
      3.17.18.1. Intent of low altitude LSS/LST use is for pilots to keep their eyes outside the
      cockpit for target area SA and acquisition. These systems should be used to provide
      pilots a “pure heads up and outside” capability without requiring heads down time during
      employment.
3.18. Air Refueling:
   3.18.1. Pilots undergoing initial/recurrency training in air refueling will not refuel with a
   student boom operator (does not apply to KC-10).
   3.18.2. Pilots will inform boom operator when refueling from particular tanker type (e.g.
   KC-10, KC-135, or other) for the first time.
   3.18.3. Pilots will not attempt a night hook-up if slipway lights are inoperative unless
   refueling is necessary to safely complete the mission.
3.19. Night Operational Procedures:
   3.19.1. Night Ground Operations. Taxi spacing will be a minimum of 300 feet and the
   aircraft will taxi on the taxiway centerline. Normally, use the taxi light during all night
   taxiing. (EXCEPTION: When the light might interfere with the vision of the pilot of an
   aircraft landing or taking off, the taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be
   visually cleared without the taxi light.)
   3.19.2. Night Takeoff. For formation takeoffs, flight/element leaders will turn the anti-
   collision strobes OFF and position lights BRIGHT (DIM as desired) STEADY when
   reaching the run-up position on the runway. The flight/element lead may direct wingmen to
   turn or leave the strobes OFF anytime the lights cause distraction. All aircraft will turn
   formation lights ON. During a night formation takeoff, call brake release and configuration
   changes over the radio. Following takeoff, each aircraft/element will climb on runway
   heading to 1,000 feet AGL and accelerate to 200 KIAS before initiating turns, except where
   departure instructions/local procedures/obstructions specifically preclude compliance.
   3.19.3. Night Join-up. Weather criteria for night join-up underneath a ceiling is 1,500 feet
   and 3 miles. Accomplish join-up/rejoin at or above 1,000 feet AGL. During the rejoin,
   wingmen will cross check their altimeter to ensure they remain at least 1,000 feet AGL. After
   join up, the anti-collision strobes will be OFF and position lights will be BRIGHT (DIM if
   necessary) STEADY for all except the last aircraft. The last aircraft will keep the anti-
   collision strobe ON and position lights BRIGHT STEADY unless otherwise directed by the
   flight lead.
 24                                                       AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


   3.19.4. Night Formation Procedures.
       3.19.4.1. -(Non-NVG equipped.) When in positions other than fingertip or route,
       maintain aircraft spacing primarily by instruments (radial/DME,or Air-to-Air TACAN)
       and/or timing, with visual reference and SADL secondary. If unable to ensure aircraft
       spacing, then establish altitude separation (minimum of 1,000 feet). At all times, pilots
       will cross-check instruments to ensure ground clearance.
       3.19.4.2. Change of lead or wing positions must be accomplished at or above 1,500 feet
       AGL, unless established on radar downwind. Lead and position changes will be called
       over the radio and should be initiated from stabilized, wings-level attitude.
   3.19.5. Night Breakup. Prior to a night formation breakup, the flight leader will confirm
   position and transmit altitude, airspeed, attitude, altimeter setting and heading. Wingmen will
   acknowledge to confirm good navigational aids.
3.20. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Procedures: Pilots must not become overconfident in the
capabilities of NVGs. Many things can cause a pilot to lose outside visual references, to include
entering the weather (intentionally or inadvertently), NVG battery failure, flight into smoke or
dust, flight into a shadowed area, sudden illumination or an incompatible light source inside or
outside of the cockpit, or sudden distractions due to an aircraft malfunction, etc. Pilots must
ensure primary and secondary flight instruments are sufficiently illuminated to allow for
immediate transition to instruments if experiencing spatial disorientation or if outside visual
references are lost.
   3.20.1. Published Guidance. USAF/MAJCOM guidance (including AFI 11-202V3 and AFI
   11-214) outlines NVG procedures. Additionally:
       3.20.1.1. NVGs will only be worn in flight by NVG qualified pilots or by upgrading
       pilots with a qualified NVG IP in the flight.
       3.20.1.2. NVG operations below 5,000 feet AGL require an operational Ground
       Collision Avoidance System (GCAS).
       3.20.1.3. All flight members will make a radio call when going "goggles on" or "goggles
       off" and only one flight member will don/doff goggles at a time.
   3.20.2. NVGs must be preflight tested and adjusted for the individual pilot in a unit eyelane
   or equivalent tester prior to NVG operations
   3.20.3. Takeoff and Landing.
       3.20.3.1. Non-NVG Takeoff and Landing qualified pilots will not wear NVGs during
       takeoff or landing. Do not don NVGs until at least 2,000 feet AGL or MSA, whichever is
       higher, in climbing or level flight. Remove NVGs at least 5 minutes prior to landing.
       3.20.3.2. NVG takeoff and landing qualified pilots may wear NVGs for takeoff and
       landing. NVG takeoffs and landings at a blacked-out aerodrome configured with AMP-3
       (covert) lighting will be flown in aircraft equipped with an infrared (IR) cover installed
       on the taxi light. NVG operations at airfields with normal (overt) lighting do not require
       the IR cover installed on the taxi light. Do not accomplish NVG approaches to an airfield
       with a combination of covert and overt runway lighting unless that specific configuration
       is tested and approved. Weather minimums for certified pilots to perform NVG takeoff
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                  25


     and landing operations are 1500/3. Weather minimums during upgrade training for
     certification are 3000/5.
  3.20.4. Illumination Levels:
     3.20.4.1. High Illumination is defined as a minimum of 2.2 millilux illumination derived
     from natural or artificial sources. This roughly equates to a 20% moon disk at an
     elevation of 30 degrees or higher. If weather or other conditions reduce actual in-flight
     illumination below 2.2 millilux, low illumination procedures will be followed.
     3.20.4.2. Low Illumination is defined as less than 2.2 millilux.
     3.20.4.3. Even when illumination levels are forecast, weather or other conditions may
     cause actual illumination levels to be higher or lower than expected. In flight, pilots must
     estimate whether actual in-flight illumination levels are High or Low, and determine if
     the existing conditions provide sufficient NVG performance to accomplish the planned
     mission and/or events. Pilots will comply with High or Low illumination
     procedures/restrictions contained here and in AFI 11-214.
  3.20.5. NVG Minimum Altitudes. Minimum altitudes for NVG operations are based on
  illumination levels, in-flight visibility, and the pilot's NVG qualification.
     3.20.5.1. The minimum altitude for all NVG upgrade sorties, familiarization
     sorties/events, sorties flown under low illumination levels, or sorties flown when in-flight
     visibility is less than 5 miles is the MSA, as defined in paragraph 3.17.12, or IAW AFI
     11-214, whichever is higher.
     3.20.5.2. The minimum altitude for all other NVG sorties flown under high illumination
     levels and with at least 5 miles in-flight visibility is IAW AFI 11-214 and MAJCOM
     supplements to AFI 11-214.
  3.20.6. Tanker Rejoin. NVGs may be worn for night tanker rejoins, but will be raised to the
  up and stowed position or removed no later than the precontact position and remain off
  through the actual contact and AAR. Goggles may be worn pre and post AAR in the
  observation position and in route position flying off the tanker.
  3.20.7. Close Formation. Wingmen wearing NVGs will fly no closer than route formation.
  3.20.8. Weather Restriction. MAJCOM established night weather restrictions apply. Pilots
  must be ready to transition to instruments and execute appropriate lost wingman or route
  abort procedures in the event they inadvertently enter the weather. Under certain IMC or
  marginal VFR conditions, NVGs may allow pilots to maintain visual references with relation
  to the ground, the horizon, other aircraft, etc. However, while wearing NVGs pilots must still
  comply with published VFR cloud clearance and visibility minimums, have an IFR clearance
  prior to entering IMC, and follow all IFR procedures while in IMC.
  3.20.9. Weapons Delivery:
     3.20.9.1. Range weather restrictions and minimum altitudes during weapons delivery
     passes are IAW AFI 11-214. Minimum altitudes during night surface attack operations
     are IAW AFI 11-214 restrictions, the pilot’s NVG qualification minimum altitude, and
     the minimum altitude allowed by the actual illumination level, whichever is higher.
 26                                                       AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


      3.20.9.2. On Class A ranges, NVG qualified pilots, with the concurrence of the Range
      Control Officer (RCO), are allowed to choose external aircraft lighting settings that
      maximize training, minimize interference with NVGs, and still allow the RCO to safely
      monitor the aircraft. Depending on the lighting conditions and RCO equipment, this
      could involve normal, reduced, covert or blacked-out lighting IAW AFI 11-214.
      3.20.9.3. NVG qualified pilots may conduct normal, reduced, covert or blacked-out
      lighting weapons deliveries IAW AFI 11-214 on ranges which do not require RCO
      control. When working with a Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) or Forward Air
      Controller (Airborne) (FAC(A)), pilots should choose external lighting settings that
      safely facilitate final control.
      3.20.9.4. During all range sorties for upgrading NVG pilots (basic NVG upgrade), covert
      or blacked-out lighting weapons deliveries may only be conducted dry.
3.21. Fuel Requirements:
   3.21.1. Joker Fuel. A pre-briefed fuel needed to terminate an event and proceed with the
   remainder of the mission.
   3.21.2. Bingo Fuel. A pre-briefed fuel state that allows the aircraft to return to the base of
   intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving
   with normal recovery fuel as defined below.
   3.21.3. Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel on initial or at the final approach fix (FAF) at the
   base of intended landing or alternate. Establish fuel quantity locally or 1,500 pounds,
   whichever is higher.
   3.21.4. Minimum Fuel. Declared whenever it becomes apparent that an aircraft will enter
   initial or start an instrument final approach at the base of intended landing, or alternate if
   required, with 1,200 pounds or less (or as established locally), or when either the Left or
   Right Main Fuel Low light illuminates, whichever occurs first.
   3.21.5. Emergency Fuel. Declared whenever it becomes apparent that an aircraft will enter
   initial or start an instrument final approach at the base of intended landing, or alternate if
   required, with 800 pounds or less, or 400 pounds in either the left or right main system,
   whichever occurs first.
3.22. Approaches and Landings:
   3.22.1. Minimum pattern and touchdown spacing. Refer to AFI11-202V3 ACCSUP,
   Chapter 5. Use touchdown spacing requirements listed for dissimilar fighter aircraft when
   wind conditions increase the likelihood of encountering wake turbulence.
   3.22.2. The desired touchdown point for a VFR approach is 500 feet past the runway
   threshold, or the glidepath interception point for a precision approach. When local procedures
   or unique runway surface conditions require landing beyond a given point on the runway,
   adjust the desired touchdown point accordingly.
   3.22.3. Landing Restrictions:
      3.22.3.1. When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the available runway,
      land at an alternate if possible.
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                    27


      3.22.3.2. Minimum landing RCR is 12. Per MAJCOM guidance, OG/CC may waive the
      minimum RCR, but in no case will landing be attempted with an RCR below 8.
      3.22.3.3. Do not land over any raised web barrier (e.g., MA-1A, 61QS11).
   3.22.4. Normally all aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the turnoff
   side of the runway when speed/conditions permit, unless local conditions dictate otherwise.
3.23. Overhead Traffic Patterns:
   3.23.1. Altitude and airspeed will be IAW T.O. 1A-10C-1 or as directed locally.
   3.23.2. Overhead patterns may be flown with unexpended practice ordnance to include
   heavyweight inerts, night illumination flares, 30 mm, unexpended live air-to-air and forward
   firing ordnance. Overhead patterns may be performed at deployed locations with
   unexpended live ordnance if required by local force protection arrival procedures.
   3.23.3. Initiate the break over the touchdown point or as directed.
   3.23.4. Execute the break individually in a level 180 degree turn to the downwind leg at
   minimum intervals of 5 seconds (except IP/SEFE chase or when in tactical formation).
   3.23.5. Aircraft will be wings level on final at approximately 300 feet AGL and 1 mile from
   the planned touchdown point.
3.24. Tactical Overhead Traffic Patterns:
   3.24.1. Tactical entry to the overhead traffic pattern is permitted if the following conditions
   are met:
      3.24.1.1. Use published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed.
      3.24.1.2. Locally develop and coordinate with appropriate air traffic control agencies
      specific procedures.
      3.24.1.3. Four aircraft are the maximum permitted. Aircraft/elements more than 6,000
      feet in trail are considered a separate flight.
      3.24.1.4. Normally position wingmen opposite the direction of the break.
      3.24.1.5. Regardless of the formation flown, no aircraft should be offset from the runway
      in the direction of the break; the intent is to avoid requiring a tighter than normal turn to
      arrive on normal downwind.
      3.24.1.6. Fly normal downwind and base position.
3.25. Low Approaches:
   3.25.1. Observe the following minimum altitudes:
      3.25.1.1. Normal single ship slow approaches—so that touchdown does not occur.
      3.25.1.2. IP/SEFE chase position—50 feet AGL.
      3.25.1.3. Formation low approaches (and non-IP/SEFE chase)--100 feet AGL.
      3.25.1.4. Chase aircraft during an emergency—300 feet AGL unless safety or
      circumstances dictate otherwise.
 28                                                        AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


   3.25.2. Go-Arounds: During go-around, remain 500 feet below VFR overhead traffic pattern
   altitude until crossing the departure end of the runway unless local procedures, missed
   approach/climb-out procedures, or controller instructions dictate otherwise.
3.26. Closed Traffic Patterns. Initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway unless
directed/cleared otherwise by local procedures or the controlling agency. Minimum airspeed
during a closed pattern, prior to configuring, is 150 KIAS. When in formation, a sequential
closed may be flown with ATC concurrence, at an interval to ensure proper spacing.
3.27. Formation Approaches and Landings:
   3.27.1. General:
       3.27.1.1. Normally accomplish formation landings from a precision approach. If not,
       accomplish landing utilizing a published instrument approach or a VFR straight-in
       approach using the VASI if available. In all cases, the rate of descent should be similar to
       a normal precision approach.
       3.27.1.2. A flight leader will lead continuation training formation landings. Upgrading
       flight leads require an IP or SQ/DO designated flight lead qualified supervisor in the
       element.
       3.27.1.3. When only one aircraft is landing from a formation approach, normally the lead
       will execute a low approach and the wingman will land. In this event, the wingman will
       break off for landing as briefed, as cleared by the leader, or in the case of poor
       positioning, accomplish a low approach.
       3.27.1.4. Do not perform practice formation approaches above 40,000 pounds gross
       weight.
   3.27.2. Formation Landing Restrictions. Aircraft configuration will be IAW paragraph 3.7.4
   Formation landings are prohibited:
       3.27.2.1. When the cross wind or gust component exceeds 15 knots.
       3.27.2.2. When the runway is reported wet; or ice, slush, or snow are on the runway.
       3.27.2.3. If runway width is less than 140 feet.
       3.27.2.4. When landing with hung ordnance or unexpended live ordnance (excluding live
       air-to-air missiles, rockets, night illumination flares and 30mm ammunition).
       3.27.2.5. If the weather is less than 500 feet and 1 1/2 miles or a flight member’s weather
       category, whichever is higher.
   3.27.3. Lead Procedures. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.A-10.
       3.27.3.1. Establish an approach speed consistent with the heavier aircraft. Approach
       speeds may be adjusted higher than standard approach speeds, depending on turbulence,
       runway length, runway condition, etc.
       3.27.3.2. Position the wingman on the upwind side if the cross wind component exceeds
       5 knots.
       3.27.3.3. Plan to land near the center of your half of the runway to ensure enough
       runway is available for the wingman.
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                 29


   3.27.4. Wingman Procedures. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.A-10.
      3.27.4.1. Maintain a minimum of 10 feet lateral wingtip spacing.
      3.27.4.2. Cross-check the runway to ensure proper runway alignment.
      3.27.4.3. Execute a climbout/missed approach if sufficient runway/aircraft clearance is
      not available.
   3.27.5. Roll-out Procedures. Refer to AFTTP 3-3.A-10.
      3.27.5.1. If the wingman overruns the leader, accept the overrun and maintain aircraft
      control on the appropriate side of the runway. Do not attempt to reposition behind the
      leader. The most important consideration is wing tip clearance.
3.28. Chaff/Flare/Smoky Devil Procedures. AFI 11-214 contains basic procedures for
employment of Chaff/Flare/Smoky Devils.
   3.28.1. Do not arm chaff/flare systems unless in an approved area with the intent to dispense
   chaff and/or flares.
   3.28.2. Minimum employment altitude for Smoky Devils is 500 feet AGL.
 30                                                         AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


                                            Chapter 4

                               INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. Approach Category:
   4.1.1. The A-10 is Approach Category D. Accomplish missed approach in accordance with
   the flight manual procedures. Missed approach airspeed is 200 to 220 KIAS.
   4.1.2. Approach category C minima may be used to an emergency/divert airfield where no
   Category D minima is published, provided:
      4.1.2.1. A straight-in approach is flown.
      4.1.2.2. The aircraft is flown at a computed final approach speed of 140 KIAS or less.
      4.1.2.3. Missed approach airspeed is 200 to 210 KIAS.
   4.1.3. Missed approach airspeeds are based on 260 KTAS or less for Category D approaches
   and 240 KTAS or less for Category C approaches. At high pressure altitudes and
   temperatures, these true airspeeds may not be compatible with published missed approach
   airspeeds and the approach should not be flown.
   4.1.4. A-10s are approved to use INS for enroute Area Navigation (RNAV) for a period not
   to exceed 1 ½ hours between INS updates. An update is defined as establishing/validating a
   positive position using visual references, GPS, or TACAN. A-10s are approved to use EGI
   for point-to-point navigation only. Do not fly (GPS or RNAV) on Q and T-routes, or terminal
   procedures (approaches and STARs) without MAJCOM approval.
4.2. Takeoff and Join-up:
   4.2.1. The flight lead will notify the appropriate ATC agency when a VMC join-up is not
   possible due to weather conditions or operational requirements. Coordinate for an
   appropriate altitude block and trail formation. Formation trail departures will comply with
   instructions for a non-standard formation flight as defined in FLIP. Flight lead should request
   IFF squawks for wingmen in trail.
4.3. Trail Procedures.
   4.3.1. General. Do not sacrifice basic instrument flying when performing secondary tasks
   during trail departures in IMC. Strictly adhere to the briefed airspeeds, power settings,
   altitudes, headings, and turn points. If task saturation occurs, cease attempts to maintain trail,
   immediately concentrate on flying the instrument procedure, and notify the flight lead. Flight
   lead will notify ATC.
   4.3.2. Trail Departure:
      4.3.2.1. Use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff spacing.
      4.3.2.2. Each aircraft/element will accelerate in MAX power to 200 KIAS. Climb speed
      will be 200 KIAS and power setting will be 800 degrees ITT unless specifically briefed
      otherwise.
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                 31


     4.3.2.3. Each aircraft/element will climb on takeoff heading to 1,000 feet AGL and
     accelerate to 200 KIAS before initiating any turns, except when departure instructions
     specifically preclude compliance.
     4.3.2.4. Each aircraft/element will call passing each 2,000 foot altitude increment (or as
     briefed) with altitude and heading passing if in a turn until join-up or level off. In
     addition, each aircraft/element will call initiating any altitude or heading change.
     Acknowledgments are not required; however, it is imperative that preceding
     aircraft/elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding
     aircraft/elements and adhere to the departure route.
     4.3.2.5. Each aircraft/element will maintain the briefed trail takeoff spacing using all
     available aircraft systems and navigational aids to monitor positions.
     4.3.2.6. Each aircraft/element will maintain at least 1,000 feet vertical separation from
     the preceding aircraft/element during the climb, at level off, and in cruise until visual
     contact is established, except in instances where departure instructions specifically
     preclude compliance. If unable to comply with MEA or ATC is unable to accommodate
     1,000 foot blocks, vertical separation may be reduced to 500 feet.
  4.3.3. Trail Recovery:
     4.3.3.1. Trail recovery procedures must be coordinated/approved through the responsible
     ATC facilities and addressed in the unit supplement to this volume. Trail recoveries will
     only be accomplished at home stations/deployed locations where procedures have been
     established and briefed. As a minimum, procedures will address each recovery profile,
     missed approach, climbout, lost contact, lost communications and desired/maximum
     spacing requirements.
     4.3.3.2. Trail recoveries are limited to a maximum of four aircraft.
     4.3.3.3. Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is
     at/above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or approach minimums,
     whichever is higher.
     4.3.3.4. Trail recoveries will not terminate in simultaneous radar or circling approaches.
     If these are required, flights will break up IAW paragraph 4.4 and obtain separate IFR
     clearances prior to the final segment of the approach.
     4.3.3.5. Flight leads will brief spacing, configuration, and airspeeds. Minimum spacing
     between aircraft is 6,000 feet and will be maintained using all available aircraft systems
     and navigational aids.
     4.3.3.6. Prior to taking spacing, flight leads will coordinate with ATC and ensure that all
     wingmen have operative navigational aids IAW paragraph 4.4 The formation will squawk
     as directed by ATC.
     4.3.3.7. ATC instructions to the lead aircraft will be for the entire flight. ATC will
     provide radar flight following for the entire formation.
     4.3.3.8. All turns are limited to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank.
     4.3.3.9. Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft will
     comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining trail separation.
 32                                                       AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


       4.3.3.10. Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for
       airspeed/configuration changes, the flight lead will direct changes by radio. When
       directed, all aircraft in the formation will comply simultaneously.
       4.3.3.11. If SA is lost or separation/deconfliction cannot be guaranteed during recovery,
       the flight lead will establish altitude deconfliction and coordinate a separate IFR
       clearance with ATC. If this occurs after established on a segment of a published
       approach, the pilot will execute a missed approach or climbout as directed by ATC.
4.4. Formation Breakup/Spacing Procedures. Formation breakup should not be
accomplished in IMC; however, if unavoidable, accomplish the breakup in straight and level
flight. Prior to a weather breakup, the flight leader will transmit attitude, airspeed, altitude,
altimeter setting, and heading. All wingmen acknowledge the transmission and confirm good
navigational aids.
4.5. Formation Penetration:
   4.5.1. Formation penetrations are restricted to two aircraft when the weather at the base of
   intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums.
   4.5.2. If flying a formation landing, the wingman should be positioned on the appropriate
   wing prior to weather penetration.
4.6. Formation Lead Changes in IMC. In IMC, formation flights will not change lead/wing
positions below 1,500 feet AGL or instrument downwind altitude, whichever is lower.
4.7. Use of the HUD. The HUD is not certified as a primary flight instrument. It may be used
as an additional instrument reference in night/IMC conditions; however, do not use it as the sole
instrument reference in these conditions. In addition, do not use the HUD to recover from an
unusual attitude or when executing lost wingman procedures except when no other reference is
available.

                         AIR-TO-AIR WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

5.1. General:
   5.1.1. AFI 11-214 contains air-to-air procedures to include operations with live ordnance
   (air-to-air missiles) applicable to all aircraft. The procedures contained in this chapter specify
   additional procedures or restrictions that are applicable to A-10C operations.
   5.1.2. This chapter applies to all missions where the intent is to conduct maneuvers used to
   defeat aerial attacks or to employ ordnance against airborne fixed wing aircraft or
   helicopters. Fixed wing air-to-air training should emphasize visual acquisition of threats,
   maneuvering to negate any attack, mutual support, and forcing the attacker to disengage.
   Anti-helicopter air-to-air training should emphasize visual search techniques, maneuvers to
   negate helicopter attacks, aspect and range determination, and weapons selection and
   employment to kill the threat.
   5.1.3. During high-aspect BFM training, a dedicated defender and offender must be clearly
   identified for each engagement. The offender will have some kind of advantage (power, G
   available, lead turn advantage at the merge, energy state at start of engagement).
   5.1.4. Prior to conducting ACBT, pilots will maneuver the aircraft to confirm proper
   operation of slats, peak performance (steady tone) and stall warning (chopped tone). If any
   component of the stall warning system does not appear to be functioning properly, do not
   conduct ACBT maneuvering.
   5.1.5. Do not conduct Air-to-Air training with hung ordnance.
5.2. Maneuvering Limits:
   5.2.1. The minimum airspeed during ACBT is 120 KIAS.
   5.2.2. During ACBT maneuvering, pilots will not maintain an angle of attack (AOA) that
   triggers the chopped stall warning tone. If the chopped tone is activated, relax back pressure
   immediately to return to an AOA that deactivates the chopped tone.
   5.2.3. The minimum maneuvering airspeed during low altitude air-to-air training is 240
   KIAS for both defensive and offensive maneuvering.
   5.2.4. Negative G guns jinks are prohibited.
   5.2.5. Night Air-to-Air weapons events will not be accomplished without specific MAJCOM
   approval.
5.3. Simulated Gun/AIM-9 Employment.
   5.3.1. If the gun is PINNED or UNPINNED, simulated air-to-air weapons employment
   using the gun trigger or AIM-9 pickle button are allowed when the following conditions are
   met:
      5.3.1.1. No live or heavyweight inert ordnance aboard the aircraft (30MM, BDU-33, and
      2.75 rockets are authorized).
      5.3.1.2. No hung ordnance.

     5.3.1.3. Master Arm switch is in TRAIN.
     5.3.1.4. GUN/PAC Arm switch is in SAFE.
     5.3.1.5. Flight lead verbally confirms training mode (TRN in the HUD or TRAIN on the
     MFCD) and GUN/PAC Arm switch SAFE and acknowledged throughout the flight.
     5.3.1.6. Cold trigger and pickle check is accomplished and acknowledged throughout the
     flight.
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                   35


                                           Chapter 6

                     AIR-TO-SURFACE WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

6.1. General. References-- AFTTP 3-1.A-10, AFTTP 3-3.A-10, T.O. 1A-10-34-1-1, T.O. 1A-
10-34-1-2, and Fighter Weapons School (FWS) Instructional Texts are primary references for
fighter weapons employment theory, planning, techniques and analysis. AFI 11-2A-10V1
contains qualification and scoring criteria. AFI 11-214 contains operating and training
procedures. Range sorties with planned BDU-33 deliveries from a TER-9 will be scheduled in
elements of two aircraft to the maximum extent possible to allow a Battle Damage Check. This
does not preclude scheduling single ship FAC(A) sorties.
6.2. Weather Minimums. Refer to AFI 11-214. Weather ceiling will be no lower than 1,500 ft
AGL.
6.3. Battle Damage/Bomb Checks. If circumstances permit, flight leads will direct a battle
damage/bomb check prior to or during RTB. This check is mandatory following the expenditure
of live ordnance (including all types of 30mm ammunition). Observe established deconfliction
responsibilities and position change procedures. Formation spacing will be no closer than normal
fingertip. Bomb checks will not be conducted at night.
6.4. Training Rules:
   6.4.1. Refer to AFI 11-214. If airspeed decreases below 210 KIAS in a pop-up attack, abort
   the maneuver. Base this airspeed on typical training weights and configurations. At heavy
   gross weight, adjust abort airspeed upward to provide sufficient G and turning room to
   recover from an adverse flight condition.
   6.4.2. Pilots must positively identify the target and deconflict ordnance footprints from
   friendly force positions prior to weapons release. Use all available means in order to acquire
   the target visually, acquire the target through a Targeting Pod (TGP) or by confirming target
   location through valid on-board/off-board cues. These cues include target talk-on description,
   marking rounds, LSS/LST, TGP, HUD symbology, IR pointers or other NVG compatible
   marking devices. For Inertially Aided Munition (IAM) deliveries using Bomb on Coordinate
   (BOC), target coordinate read back to the JTAC/FAC(A) must be off the DSMS page.
       6.4.2.1. LSS/LST or Pave Penny procedures.
           6.4.2.1.1. LSS/LST employment utilizes the concepts of a safety and optimum attack
           zones.
           6.4.2.1.2. Reference JP 3-09.1 for laser safety and optimal attack zones.
           6.4.2.1.3. LSS/LST will not be used as a sole source for target identification. In some
           situations, laser spots shift from the designated target to the laser source while
           operating in the optimal attack zone—precluding total reliance on the laser spot.
           6.4.2.1.4. Attack heading will avoid the target-to-laser designator safety zone to
           preclude false target indications.
   6.4.3. FTU/MQT Pilots:
 36                                                       AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


      6.4.3.1. Will not change targets once roll-in to final is initiated except during two-target
      strafe.
      6.4.3.2. Will not perform element pop-ups. This does not preclude IP chase or tactical
      formation ingress to the target.
   6.4.4. Local operational procedures/directives will specify night spacing techniques and
   order of night weapons deliveries commensurate with aircraft performance, flight manual
   restrictions and peculiarities of local range geography and target sets. Procedures should
   ensure performance of the most demanding events after the pilot is acclimated to night
   weapons deliveries.
6.5. Live Ordnance Procedures:
   6.5.1. Refer to AFI 11-214.
   6.5.2. When Ground Controllers are operating on Class B/C ranges, the following
   procedures apply:
      6.5.2.1. All pilots will be familiar with applicable range weapons delivery procedures,
      appropriate targets and weapons footprints.
      6.5.2.2. Ground personnel locations will be briefed and acknowledged by all pilots.
      6.5.2.3. Pilots will not expend ordnance if any doubt exists as to the ground personnel or
      intended target locations.
6.6. Simulated Air-to-Surface Weapons Employment:
   6.6.1. A simulated attack is defined as an attack in which the pilot presses the weapons
   release (pickle) button and/or pulls the gun trigger with the intention of conducting a dry
   pass.
   6.6.2. If the gun is PINNED or UNPINNED, simulated attacks against off-range targets are
   permitted using the gun trigger and pickle button when the following conditions are met:
      6.6.2.1. No live or heavyweight inert ordnance aboard the aircraft (30MM, BDU-33, and
      2.75 rockets are authorized).
      6.6.2.2. No hung ordnance.
      6.6.2.3. DELETED.
      6.6.2.4. Master Arm switch is in TRAIN.
      6.6.2.5. GUN/PAC Arm switch is in SAFE.
      6.6.2.6. Flight lead verbally confirms training mode (TRN in the HUD or TRAIN on the
      MFCD) and GUN/PAC Arm switch SAFE and acknowledged throughout the flight.
      6.6.2.7. Cold trigger and pickle check accomplished and acknowledged throughout the
      flight.

   6.7.2. Aircraft/Helicopter Separation. Ensure separation through one or both of the following
   methods:
      6.7.2.1. Altitude blocks with at least 100 feet separation between the top of the helicopter
      block and the bottom of the A-10 block.
      6.7.2.2. Routes, sectors, or timing procedures that ensure deconfliction.
   6.7.3. Training Rules. Normal air-to-surface training rules apply, to include calling Knock-
   It-Off if situational awareness of helicopter positions is lost.
   6.7.4. Radio Frequencies. All participants must monitor one common frequency.

                                            Chapter 7

                        ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

7.1. General. This chapter contains procedures to follow when other than normal operations
occur. They do not, however, replace or supersede procedures contained in the flight manual or
the use of sound judgment.
   7.1.1. Accept no aircraft for flight with a known malfunction which would compromise the
   safe conduct of the flight until completing appropriate corrective actions.
   7.1.2. Do not taxi aircraft with malfunctions that affect the nosewheel steering or brake
   systems.
   7.1.3. After isolating and/or correcting a malfunctioning system, do not use that system
   again unless its use in a degraded mode is essential for recovery. Do not conduct in-flight
   trouble-shooting after completing flight manual emergency procedures.
   7.1.4. When a fuel imbalance is greater than T.O. 1A-10C-1 limits, terminate tactical
   maneuvering and investigate. If the fuel imbalance was caused by a slow feeding tank that
   can be corrected, vice a fuel system failure, the mission may continue IAW T.O. 1A-10C-1
   guidance. Terminate the mission if fuel imbalance cannot be corrected. Instruments, medium
   altitude navigation, deployment missions, and level weapons deliveries are authorized
   profiles to reduce gross weight.
7.2. Ground Aborts:
   7.2.1. When a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, the flight leader will normally realign
   (or align as briefed) flight positions to maintain a numerical call sign sequence. Flight leaders
   will advise the appropriate agencies of such changes.
   7.2.2. A flight of two or more aircraft with only one designated flight lead in the formation
   must either sympathetically abort or proceed on a pre-briefed single-ship mission should the
   flight lead abort.
   7.2.3. Pilots who do not takeoff with the flight may join the flight at a briefed rendezvous
   point prior to a tactical event, or may fly a briefed alternate single-ship mission. FTU
   students may also follow this procedure if allowed by the appropriate syllabus, and approved
   by the squadron commander or operations officer. If accomplishing a join-up on an air-to-
   ground range, terminate all events until the joining aircraft has achieved proper spacing.
7.3. Takeoff Aborts:
   7.3.1. Prior to flight, every member of the flight will review and understand takeoff and
   landing data. Place particular emphasis on takeoff and abort factors during abnormal
   situations such as short/wet runway, heavy gross weights, and abort sequence in formation
   flights.
   7.3.2. If an abort occurs during takeoff roll, clear to the appropriate side of the runway as
   expeditiously as possible based on position within the element. If this is not feasible because
   of aircraft control issues, clear straight ahead and consider directing a flight abort for
   subsequent flight members. As soon as possible, give call sign and state intentions.
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                     39


   Following aircraft will alter takeoff roll to ensure clearance or will abort takeoff if unable to
   maintain adequate clearance.
   7.3.3. Anytime an aircraft experiences a high speed abort and hot brakes are suspected:
      7.3.3.1. Declare a ground emergency.
      7.3.3.2. Taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area and perform hot brake
      procedures.
7.4. Air Aborts:
   7.4.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original numerical call
   sign when communicating with agencies outside of the flight. Flight Leads may renumber
   members for ease of communication within the flight.
   7.4.2. The pilot of an aborting aircraft will advise the flight leader of the conditions
   necessitating the abort, intentions and assistance required.
   7.4.3. If the flight leader aborts, the designated deputy leader will assume command of the
   flight.
   7.4.4. Escort aborting aircraft with an emergency condition to the field of intended landing.
   When other than an emergency condition exists, the flight leader will determine if the
   aborting aircraft requires an escort.
   7.4.5. Abort the mission, regardless of apparent damage or subsequent normal operation, for
   any of the following:
      7.4.5.1. Birdstrike/foreign object damage.
      7.4.5.2. Over-G. The aircraft will land as soon as practical out of a straight-in approach.
      7.4.5.3. Flight control system anomalies. Declare an emergency, even if the malfunction
      appears corrected.
      7.4.5.4. Engine flameout/stagnation or shutdown. This applies even if a successful restart
      is accomplished. Exception: Intentional shutdowns for Functional Check Flights (FCFs).
7.5. Radio Failure:
   7.5.1. General. Individual aircraft experiencing radio failure will comply with procedures
   outlined in FLIP, AFI 11-205, AFI 11-202V3, this volume, and local directives.
   7.5.2. Formation:
      7.5.2.1. Flight members who experience total radio failure while in close or route
      formation will maneuver within close/route parameters to attract the attention of another
      flight member and give the appropriate visual signals. Consider using a J28.2 text
      message to make contact with other flight members. Using the survival radio is an option
      as well. Terminate the mission as soon as practical and lead the NORDO aircraft to the
      base of intended landing or a divert base. Perform a formation approach to a drop-off on
      final unless safety, fuel, weather, or other considerations dictate otherwise.
      7.5.2.2. If flying other than close/route formation when radio failure occurs, the NORDO
      aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position on another flight member. The
      joining/wing aircraft is responsible for deconfliction until the other flight member
40                                                       AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


     acknowledges his presence by a wing rock, signifying clearance to join. Once joined, the
     NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual signals. If prebriefed, the NORDO
     aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and hold. If no one has rejoined prior to
     reaching BINGO fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed to the base of intended
     landing or a divert base IAW paragraph 7.5.1 above. Aircraft experiencing any
     difficulty/emergency in addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation.
  7.5.3. Surface Attack NORDO Procedures for Class A/Manned Class B Ranges:
     7.5.3.1. Attempt contact with the RCO on the appropriate backup frequency.
     7.5.3.2. If unable to re-establish contact, make a pass by the range control tower on the
     attack heading while rocking wings, and turn in the direction of traffic. The flight leader
     will either rejoin on the NORDO aircraft, or direct another flight member to rejoin on the
     NORDO aircraft, in order to escort the NORDO aircraft to a recovery base.
     7.5.3.3. If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, make a pass by the range control
     tower, if practical, on the attack heading while rocking wings, turn opposite the direction
     of traffic, and proceed to a recovery base. The flight leader will either rejoin on the
     NORDO aircraft, or direct another flight member to rejoin on the NORDO aircraft, in
     order to escort the emergency aircraft.
     7.5.3.4. If the RCO experiences radio failure, the flight will hold high and maintain
     spacing while attempting contact on primary and backup frequencies.
     7.5.3.5. If radio failure occurs and circumstances preclude landing with unexpended
     ordnance, safe jettison of ordnance may be accomplished provided the following
     conditions are met:
        7.5.3.5.1. The NORDO aircraft joins on another flight member that has radio contact
        with the RCO and the remainder of the flight.
        7.5.3.5.2. Stores jettison visual signals specified in AFI 11-205 are relayed to the
        NORDO aircraft to initiate jettison.
  7.5.4. Surface Attack NORDO Procedures for Unmanned Class B and Class C Ranges:
     7.5.4.1. Make a “high and dry” pass on the target, if possible, while rocking wings.
     7.5.4.2. The leader will either rejoin the flight in sequence and recover, or direct another
     flight member to escort the NORDO aircraft to a recovery base.
     7.5.4.3. If the NORDO has an emergency, he will, if practical, make a pass on the target,
     rocking wings, turn opposite direction of traffic, and proceed to a recovery base. The
     flight leader will either rejoin on the NORDO aircraft, or direct a flight member to rejoin
     on the NORDO aircraft, in order to escort the emergency aircraft.
  7.5.5. NORDO Recovery:
     7.5.5.1. The procedures in AFI 11-205 and FLIP apply.
     7.5.5.2. If flying a straight-in approach and a go-around becomes necessary, the chase
     will go-around, pass the NORDO aircraft and rock his wings.
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                       41


       7.5.5.3. The NORDO aircraft will go-around if the situation allows. If the NORDO
       aircraft is in formation as a wingman, the leader will initiate a gentle turn into the
       wingman and begin the go-around.
7.6. Severe Weather Penetration:
   7.6.1. Do not attempt flight through severe weather. However, if unavoidable, obtain
   separate clearances prior to severe weather penetration. If not feasible, flights may assume an
   in-trail formation with a minimum of 1 NM separation between aircraft/elements. Obtain
   ATC clearance for a non-standard formation.
7.7. Lost Wingman Procedures. In any lost wingman situation, immediate separation of
aircraft is essential. Upon losing sight of the leader or unable to maintain formation due to spatial
disorientation (SD), the wingman will simultaneously execute the applicable lost wingman
procedures while transitioning to instruments and inform the flight lead. Refer to paragraph 7.8
for specific SD considerations. Smooth application of control inputs is imperative to minimize
the effects of SD. Permission from the flight lead is required to rejoin the flight once lost
wingman procedures have been executed.
   7.7.1. Two- or Three-Ship Flights:
       7.7.1.1. Wings-Level Flight. In wings-level flight (climb, descent, or straight and level)
       simultaneously inform lead and turn away using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then
       resume heading and obtain separate clearance.
       7.7.1.2. Turns:
           7.7.1.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank
           for 15 seconds and inform lead. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to
           resuming the turn. Obtain a separate clearance.
           7.7.1.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation,
           and inform the flight lead to roll out of the turn. Maintain angle of bank to ensure
           lateral separation and obtain separate clearance. Once assured separation, the leader
           may resume turn. Note: If in three-ship echelon, refer to four-ship lost wingman
           procedures.
       7.7.1.3. Precision/Non-Precision Final. The wingman will momentarily turn away to
       ensure separation, inform lead, and commence the published missed approach procedure
       while obtaining a separate clearance from approach control.
       7.7.1.4. Missed Approach. The wingman will momentarily turn away to ensure
       separation, inform lead, and continue the published or assigned missed approach
       procedure while climbing to 500 feet above missed approach altitude. Obtain a separate
       clearance from approach control.
   7.7.2. Four-Ship Flights. If only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the previous
   procedures will provide safe separation. Since it is impossible for number 4 to immediately
   ascertain that number 3 still has visual contact with lead, it is imperative that initial action of
   number 4's be based on the assumption that number 3 has also become separated. Number 2
   and 3 will follow the procedures outlined above. Number 4 will follow the appropriate
   procedure listed below:
 42                                                       AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


       7.7.2.1. Wings-Level Flight. Simultaneously inform lead and turn away using 30 degrees
       of bank for 30 seconds, then resume heading and obtain separate clearance.
       7.7.2.2. Turns:
          7.7.2.2.1. Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of bank for 30
          seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3 and obtain separate clearance.
          7.7.2.2.2. Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose-tail separation
          and increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Inform lead to roll out. Obtain separate
          clearance. Lead will resume turn only when separation is ensured.
   7.7.3. Flight Lead. The flight lead should acknowledge the lost wingman's radio call and
   transmit attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed and other parameters as appropriate. Wingman
   will base lost wingman procedure on the flight lead's transmitted parameters (use caution
   observing published terrain clearance limits).
       7.7.3.1. Flight leads will be directive to ensure aircraft separation as required by the
       situation.
   7.7.4. Wingman. If a wingman becomes separated and any aircraft experiences radio failure,
   the aircraft with the operational radio will obtain a separate clearance. NORDO aircraft will
   ensure the appropriate IFF/SIF code is selected IAW either the Flight Information Handbook
   or national rules while proceeding with the previous clearance. If an emergency situation
   arises along with radio failure, select IFF/SIF to emergency (7700) for the remainder of the
   flight.
   7.7.5. Practice. Practice lost wingman procedures only in VMC.
7.8. Spatial Disorientation. Conditions which prevent a clear visual horizon or increase pilot
tasking are conducive to SD. To prevent SD, the pilot will make a conscious attempt to increase
instrument cross-check rate. When SD symptoms are detected, take the following steps until
symptoms abate:
   7.8.1. Single Ship:
       7.8.1.1. Concentrate on flying basic instruments with frequent reference to the attitude
       indicator. Use heads-down instruments. Defer non-essential cockpit tasks.
       7.8.1.2. If symptoms persist, bring aircraft to straight and level flight with reference to
       the attitude indicator and maintain straight and level flight, terrain permitting, until
       symptoms abate, (usually 30 to 60 seconds), and conditions permitting.
       7.8.1.3. If necessary, declare an emergency and advise ATC.
       7.8.1.4. It is possible for SD to proceed to the point where the pilot is unable to see,
       interpret, or process information from the flight instruments. Aircraft control in such a
       situation is impossible. A pilot must recognize when physiological/psychological limits
       have been exceeded and be prepared to abandon the aircraft.
   7.8.2. Formation Lead:
       7.8.2.1. A flight lead with SD will advise wingmen that lead has SD and will comply
       with procedures in paragraph 7.8.1 above.
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                     43


      7.8.2.2. If possible, wingmen should confirm attitude and provide verbal feedback to
      lead.
      7.8.2.3. If symptoms persist, terminate the mission and recover the flight by the simplest
      and safest means possible.
   7.8.3. Formation Wingman:
      7.8.3.1. Wingman will advise lead when disorientation makes it difficult to maintain
      position.
      7.8.3.2. Lead will advise wingman of aircraft attitude, altitude, heading, and airspeed.
      7.8.3.3. If symptoms persist, lead will establish straight and level flight for 30 to 60
      seconds, conditions permitting.
      7.8.3.4. If the above procedures are not effective, lead should consider passing the lead
      to the wingman, provided the leader will be able to maintain situation awareness from a
      chase position. Transfer lead while in straight and level flight. Once assuming the lead,
      maintain straight and level flight for 60 seconds. If necessary, terminate the tactical
      mission and recover by the simplest and safest means possible.
   7.8.4. Greater Than Two-Ship Formation. Lead should separate the flight into elements to
   more effectively handle a wingman with persistent SD symptoms. Establish straight and level
   flight IAW paragraph 4.4 (Formation Breakup). The element with the SD pilot will remain
   straight and level while the other element separates from the flight.
7.9. Armament System Malfunctions:
   7.9.1. Inadvertent Release:
      7.9.1.1. Record switch positions at the time of inadvertent release and provide to
      armament and safety personnel. Record the impact point, if known.
      7.9.1.2. Check armament switches safe and do not attempt further release in any mode.
      Treat remaining stores as hung ordnance and obtain a chase aircraft during RTB, if
      practical.
      7.9.1.3. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison in a suitable area on a
      single pass, if practical.
   7.9.2. Failure to Release/Hung Ordnance. If ordnance fails to release when all appropriate
   switches are set, proceed as follows:
      7.9.2.1. Live Ordnance. For hung live ordnance or an aircraft malfunction that precludes
      further live weapons delivery, refer to 1A-10C-34-1-1. The following procedures also
      apply:
          7.9.2.1.1. Note all release and fusing switches, then safe.
          7.9.2.1.2. Attempt to jettison store(s) using jettison or alternate delivery mode.
          Consider attempting to jettison the rack if ordnance is unsecure or unable to
          determine security.
          7.9.2.1.3. If ordnance remains on the aircraft, follow the hung ordnance recovery
          procedures.
44                                                          AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


     7.9.2.2. Practice/Inert Ordnance:
         7.9.2.2.1. Re-check switch positions and make an additional attempt to expend. If no
         release occurs, select another mode of delivery in an attempt to expend. Re-
         attempted release of a BDU-33 from a TER-9 should be accomplished from a diving
         delivery followed by a climbing safe escape maneuver in order to provide positive G-
         loading to potentially separate the bomb from a malfunctioning TER.
         7.9.2.2.2. If the secondary release mode fails, ordnance from other
         stations/dispensers may be released providing the aircraft will remain within
         symmetrical load limits.
         7.9.2.2.3. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison in a suitable area on
         a single pass, if practical.
         7.9.2.2.4. If ordnance remains on the aircraft, follow the hung ordnance recovery
         procedures.
  7.9.3. Hang Fire/Misfire—General:
     7.9.3.1. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft is a hangfire. If this occurs, the
     chase pilot should closely observe and safety check the missile.
     7.9.3.2. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate switches were selected is a
     misfire. If this occurs, safe the Master Arm switch and follow the hung ordnance
     recovery procedures.
     7.9.3.3. T.O. 1A-10C-34-1-1contains hangfire/misfire procedures for specific ordnance
     types.
  7.9.4. Gun Unsafe. Refer to T.O. 1A-10C-34-1-1. The following procedures also apply:
     7.9.4.1. If the gun unsafe light is accompanied by any unusual noise/vibration, or any
     other indication of gun/aircraft damage, the pilot will declare an emergency.
     7.9.4.2. Accomplish gear lowering over an unpopulated area.
  7.9.5. Recovery with Weapons Malfunction/Hung Ordnance:
     7.9.5.1. If practical, visually inspect the aircraft for damage.
     7.9.5.2. Declare an emergency (not required for hung practice/inert ordnance or rockets).
     7.9.5.3. Obtain a chase aircraft, if available, and avoid populated areas and trail
     formations.
     7.9.5.4. Land from a straight-in approach, or IAW local hung ordnance procedures.
     7.9.5.5. In case of a delayed BDU-33 release, write up the incident in the AFTO Forms
     781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document and declare the aircraft code-3
     during maintenance debrief. A delayed release occurs when the BDU-33 releases from
     the TER-9/A later than planned by the pilot and impacts more than 300 meters long of the
     target or hangs and subsequently falls off the aircraft later in the sortie.
  7.9.6. Miscellaneous Procedures:
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                                    45


      7.9.6.1. Pilots will not attempt to expend ordnance using a delivery system with a known
      weapons release malfunction.
      7.9.6.2. When abnormal missile launch or erratic missile flight is noted after launch,
      another aircraft will visually inspect the launching aircraft (if possible) to determine if
      any damage has occurred.
7.10. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures:
   7.10.1. Simulated Emergency Procedures--Definition. Any procedure that produces an effect
   that would closely parallel the actual emergency such as retarding the throttle to idle and
   disengaging the SAS to simulate a single engine situation.
   7.10.2. Emergency Practice:
      7.10.2.1. Accomplish all practice and/or training related to aborted takeoffs in a Cockpit
      Familiarization Trainer (CFT), Full Motion Trainer (FMT) or a static aircraft (if trainers
      unavailable).
      7.10.2.2. Practice in-flight engine shutdown is prohibited (except during FCF profiles).
      7.10.2.3. While in-flight, simulated loss of both engines is prohibited.
   7.10.3. Simulated Single Engine (SSE) Approach/ Landing:
      7.10.3.1. Do not initiate simulated single engine failure below 1,000 feet AGL and
      terminate if the aircraft descends below 800 feet AGL prior to base leg or the airspeed
      drops below computed final approach speed for the aircraft configuration.
      7.10.3.2. Follow procedures in T.O. 1A-10C-1 for emergency landing patterns and actual
      single engine approaches as appropriate for the simulated engine failure situation. Pilots
      will engage anti-skid prior to landing.
      7.10.3.3. Pilots will plan approaches to avoid turns into the simulated dead engine when
      practical. If turns into the simulated dead engine are necessary, plan patterns to minimize
      bank angle.
      7.10.3.4. IQT or MQT pilots will not perform simulated single engine full stop landings
      unless chased by an IP.
      7.10.3.5. Simulated single engine approaches not terminating in a full stop landing will
      utilize both engines during go-around, except single engine training conducted above
      5,000 feet AGL.
   7.10.4. Practice of emergency landing patterns at active airfields is authorized provided that:
      7.10.4.1. Adequate crash rescue and air traffic control facilities are available and in
      operation.
      7.10.4.2. The pilot is CMR/BMC. MQT pilots may practice emergency landing patterns
      when chased by a qualified flight lead. IQT pilots must be chased by an IP.
      7.10.4.3. Radio calls at pattern entry and as directed locally or by the controlling agency
      include the type emergency being simulated.
7.11. Manual Reversion Approach and Landing. Factors to consider are pilot proficiency,
instrument approach facilities, runway conditions, weather at the recovery field, and any
 46                                                          AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012


accompanying aircraft malfunctions. Controlled bailout is recommended anytime existing
conditions may preclude a safe recovery or during single engine operations.
   7.11.1. Flying in manual reversion is something that is done infrequently and must be treated
   accordingly. A thorough review of manual reversion procedures in the Dash-1 and/or Dash-6
   will be accomplished before any flights where manual reversion is a mandatory part of the
   flight profile. Particular attention will be placed on actions to be taken when problems arise
   with manual reversion flight. The first action must be to revert to the normal flight control
   mode. If that action does not solve the problem and the aircraft is uncontrollable, then
   ejection is recommended.
   7.11.2. Pilots who fly in manual reversion must be completely aware of the characteristics
   of, problems associated with, and procedures to use with manual reversion.
       7.11.2.1. Other than actual emergencies requiring manual reversion, pilots will only go
       into manual reversion when on a dedicated FCF, FCF upgrade sortie or FTU upgrade
       sortie.
       7.11.2.2. Aircraft must have less than 350 rounds of 30 mm and a configuration of
       symmetrically loaded TERS, empty TERS, rocket pods or clean to use manual reversion.
       7.11.2.3. If aircraft will not go into Manual Reversion or the pitch trim does not work,
       return Manual Reversion switch to NORM.
7.12. Search and Rescue (SARCAP) Procedures. In the event an aircraft is lost in flight,
actions must begin to locate possible survivors and initiate rescue efforts. It is critical all flight
members aggressively pursue location and rescue of downed personnel even though they seem
uninjured. Many downed aircrews initially suffer from shock or have delayed reactions to
ejection injuries. The following procedures are by no means complete and may require
adjustment to meet each unique search and rescue situation. Chapter 8, Local Operating
Procedures, 8.2.2.6, Abnormal Procedures, details specific procedures.
   7.12.1. SQUAWK. Immediately terminate maneuvering using appropriate Knock-It-Off
   procedures. Establish a SARCAP commander. Place IFF to EMER to alert ATC or Ground
   Control Intercept (GCI) of the emergency situation.
   7.12.2. TALK. Communicate the emergency situation and aircraft/flight intentions
   immediately to control agencies. Use GUARD frequency if necessary.
   7.12.3. MARK. Mark the last known position of survivor/crash site using any means
   available. Use TACAN/INS position, TAD or TGP marks, ATC/GCI positioning, or ground
   references to identify the immediate area for subsequent rescue efforts.
   7.12.4. SEPARATE. Remain above the last observed parachute altitudes until determining
   the position of all possible survivors. Deconflict other aircraft in the SARCAP by altitude to
   preclude midair collision. Establish high/low CAPs as necessary to facilitate communications
   with other agencies.
   7.12.5. BINGO. Revise BINGO fuels or recovery bases as required to maintain maximum
   SARCAP coverage over survivor/crash site. Do not overfly BINGO fuel. Relinquish
   SARCAP operation to designated rescue forces upon their arrival.

8.1. General. This chapter is reserved for unit local operating procedures. Units composed of
dissimilar aircraft may publish guidance in a single, stand-alone local operating instruction (OI)
instead of supplementing this AFI. Added or stand-alone procedures will not be less restrictive
than those contained elsewhere in this volume. This chapter is not intended to be a single source
document for procedures contained in other directives or regulations. Avoid unnecessary
repetition of guidance provided in other established directives; however, reference to those
directives is acceptable when it serves to facilitate location of information necessary for local
operating procedures. This chapter is authorized to be issued to each A-10 pilot.
8.2. Procedures. Unless changed by MAJCOM or subordinate agency, the following
procedures apply:

       8.2.2.8. Securing Aircraft After Emergencies
       8.2.2.9. Approved Alternate Missions
       8.2.2.10. Cross-Country/Servicing Procedures
       8.2.2.11. Search and Rescue (SARCAP) Procedures
8.3. Distributing Guidance. When published, units will forward copies of local operation
procedures to their respective MAJCOMs and appropriate subordinate agencies for review and
AFI11-2A-10CV3 22 MARCH 2012                                                               49


comment. Distribution of local guidance may begin before the review process is complete unless
otherwise specified by MAJCOM or appropriate subordinate agency. If a procedure is deemed
applicable to all A-10 units, it will be incorporated into the basis AFI volume.

                                   CBRNE OPERATIONS

A16.1. General Information. Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly
airfield presents a serious threat to flying operations. Although the most effective way for
aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before those weapons are detonated/dispersed and
then land at a field that has not been contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate
from a field that has come under CBRNE attack.
A16.2. Mission Preparation. Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned
launch and recovery airfields, potential divert bases, and throughout the area in which the sortie
may fly. Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and the MOPP level in effect for
relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment (ACDE) or
Ground Crew Ensemble (GCE) to match the appropriate MOPP level (reference AFMAN 10-
2602) and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as required.
A16.3. Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight. This may entail donning ACDE or
transitioning from GCE to ACDE. Take precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or
contamination while in transit from the squadron facility to the aircraft. If possible, transport
aircrew in a vehicle that provides overhead cover (enclosed vehicle). If aircrew travel on foot is
unavoidable, choose a route that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun
shades, buildings, etc.) to avoid agents that may be settling from the air. If extra aircrew
members are available for preflight duties, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE. This
will allow the aircrew actually flying to minimize exposure.
   A16.3.1. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) Prior to Engine Start. If Alarm Red occurs
   during the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. This may require
   use of the ground crew mask. A hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) provides optimum
   protection, if available. Use caution if entering a HAS that contains aircraft and/or
   equipment. Close doors after entry. If a HAS or other overhead cover is not immediately
   available, accept the best rapidly reachable cover.
A16.4. Engine Start to Takeoff. If a HAS is available, use it to minimize exposure time by
accomplishing aircraft arming and End of Runway (EOR) procedures inside it (if local
procedures permit) and by delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to takeoff.
   A16.4.1. Aircraft Launch to Survive (LTS). Units will develop local procedures to provide
   this option to the commander. In general, aircraft may LTS any time after engine start if they
   have sufficient fuel and safe, expeditious access to a runway. This option may only be
   practical for aircraft that are near EOR prior to takeoff or that have just landed.
   A16.4.2. Alarm Red Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal procedure is to shut down.
   Engine noise may preclude effectiveness of normal alert notification procedures, so ensure
   ground personnel are aware of the alarm warning, assume proper MOPP, and close HAS
   doors. Use hand signals if necessary.
   A16.4.3. Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish
   procedures for this contingency depending on whether additional protection is available
   along the taxi route (empty HAS, for instance). Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a
   HAS would be available to assist in normal engine shutdown procedures and to close HAS

   doors. If protection is not available, the best option may be LTS. Maintain contact with
   Command and Control (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance Operations
   Center, Supervisor of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan.
A16.5. Takeoff to Landing.
   A16.5.1. Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination occurred prior to
   takeoff, flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The total amount of
   dissipation will be greater with lower flight altitudes and longer flight times. Because the
   agent may have entered wheel wells, flaps, etc., consider flying in landing configuration to
   increase airflow to these areas. In any circumstances, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to
   achieve complete decontamination.
   A16.5.2. Preparing to Land. Aircrew should remain aware of the status of primary and
   alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there
   is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs preclude
   divert, hold until the Alarm Red (or theater equivalent) has cleared or become an Alarm
   Black. Prior to landing, gain awareness of contaminated sectors of the airfield and of
   current/forecast surface winds. Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction to plan
   a route from landing to engine shutdown. The liquid deposition phase following a CW
   airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a
   contaminated environment and MOPP 4.
A16.6. Landing to Engine Shutdown. Take advantage of any protection available, minimizing
taxi time and distance. Maintain contact with C2 in order to remain aware of unexploded
ordnance and/or damage to airfield movement surfaces. If a HAS is available and local
procedures permit, accomplish aircraft de-arm and EOR procedures there. If Alarm Red (or
Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to
those discussed in the engine-start-to-takeoff section.
A16.7. After Engine Shutdown. Don appropriate MOPP if not already worn. If circumstances
permit, accomplish normal post-flight inspection procedures. If the aircraft is not contaminated,
close the canopy. If there is any suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew will process
through an aircrew contamination control area (ACCA). Accomplish maintenance debriefings
under cover to the maximum extent possible.
