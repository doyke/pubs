(MAXWELL AFB) AETCI 10-205, 20 Aug 2009, is supplemented as follows.

(MAXWELL AFB) This supplement implements AETCI 10-205, AETC Exercise Program. It
establishes requirements and procedures for planning, conducting, and assessing readiness
exercises on Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex in accordance with AETC guidance. Refer
recommended changes and/or corrections to this publication to the Office of Primary
Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication,
through your chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes
prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN)
33-363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at
https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61/afrims/afrims. This supplement does not apply to AFRC or
ANG units.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It clarifies
applicability for AETC units on non-AETC bases; standardizes wing-level ownership and
location guidance for coordination (paragraph 3.8), execution (paragraphs 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 6.1),
and assessment (paragraphs 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3); and updates guidance on exercise evaluation
(paragraphs 2.5 and 2.6), evaluation team member appointment (paragraph 2.7.2.4) and training
(paragraph 2.7.2.1), exercise reporting (paragraph 5.3.1), application for real-world exercise
credit (paragraphs 6.1.4 and 6.2.2), the lessons learned program (paragraph 5.3.2), and frequency
of exercises (paragraphs 6.9 and 6.11.4); and emphasizes principles that enhance ability to
survive and operate (ATSO) in base exercises (paragraphs 6.11.4.1 and 6.11.4.2).

(MAXWELL AFB) This rewrite adds references to authorized simulation forms; list of locally
authorized simulations and exercise ground rules unique to Maxwell-Gunter; and lists of
facilities exempt from total evacuation during exercies (Attachmennt 3).

                                            Chapter 1

                                    EXERCISE PROGRAM

1.1. Scope. The AETC exercise program exists to enhance readiness and improve AETC
installations’ contingency and crisis responses. It outlines procedures to organize military
exercises and distribute the results the command. Unless prohibited by a higher directive, the
installation commander may delegate personnel to accomplish the tasks in this instruction. AFI
10-204, Readiness Exercises and After-Action Reporting Program, addresses AETC unit
participation in joint and service exercises. AETCI 10-205, combined with other Air Force and
AETC publications (Attachment 1) and corresponding installation publications, is the basis for
all readiness exercises. This instruction does not relieve units (host or tenant) from the obligation
to comply with exercise requirements established by other directives.
   1.1.1. HQ AETC/A3OS chairs the AETC EET Working Group (WG). The EET WG will
   ensure installation objectives support Air Force EET program objectives. Although the
   AETC/A3OS chairs the WG, the entire group will vet installation exercise clarification,
   verification, and validation, and field specialists will address specific areas. The EET WG, as
   the body of subject matter experts is responsible for the following:
       1.1.1.1. Review and approve AETC guidance waivers.
       1.1.1.2. Solicit guidance from appropriate Air Staff points of contact.
       1.1.1.3. Review training issues.
       1.1.1.4. Monitor installation operational plans and exercises.
       1.1.1.5. Review readiness issues, staff assistance visits (SAV), and exercise and
       inspector general (IG) trends.
       1.1.1.6. Provide EET chief training.
   1.1.2. See the AETC EET Community of Practice (CoP) on the Air Force Portal for major
   command (MAJCOM) guidance updates.
   1.1.3. Installation EETs will ensure war and contingency plans address all EM program
   requirements, and will establish installation and unit commander responsibilities according to
   AFI. Installation tenant units will tailor response capabilities to the installation mission and
   threat assessment. The installation commander will ensure units can fulfill their respective
   missions while satisfying the exercise program intent.
1.2. Objective. Maximize benefits gained through exercises by enhancing readiness, boosting
combat capability, streamlining procedures, and improving system support.
1.3. Exercise Policy. Installation commanders use the EET to assess an installation’s ability to
perform its war and peacetime contingency missions. Each installation will plan, conduct, and
assess exercises as required by applicable directives.
   1.3.1. The primary purpose of EET exercises is to measure, record, and analyze
   performance, and identify problems and ensure corrective actions are implemented. Although
   the primary emphasis is to identify problems, training is also a large part of every exercise
   scenario. Installation EETs are typically populated by functional experts.

     1.3.2. Each functional area that participates in exercises must provide assistance as required
     by the EET chief (i.e., EET membership, exercise scenario development, evaluator training,
     report preparation).
1.4. Recognition Program. EET members are eligible to compete for AETC readiness awards,
according to AETCI 36-2803, Operations Recognition Program.

                                           Chapter 2

                                    EVALUATION TEAM

2.1. Scope. The EET is a key element of the AETC exercise program, responsible for planning,
conducting, and assessing all required exercises. It provides commanders, staff, and functional
managers with independent information regarding their ability to respond to crises or
contingencies.
   2.1.1. When two or more units conduct joint exercises, they will coordinate with the EET
   chief to help validate without duplicating requirements.
   2.1.2. Appoint EET chiefs according to AFI 10-2501 and AFI 90-201, Inspector General
   Activities. Installation commanders will determine who will oversee the installation exercise
   program: vice commander (CV), plans and programs (XP), or the IG.
   2.1.3. The type of exercise conducted determines which evaluators and functional areas are
   involved. Emergency management (EM) exercises will use evaluators from the
   Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) 10-2 functional support areas. (See
   AFI         10-2501,         Attachment        4,       for        guidelines,        and
   https://wwwd.my.af.mil/afknprod/AETC_CAT_CoP for more information.)
2.2. EET Membership. Assign highly qualified military or civilian personnel from each
functional area assessed to the EET. Members should have broad expertise in their functional
specialties. Unit leaders should appoint EET members in writing to serve at least a year
following certification. Note: The installation deployment officer or civil engineering readiness
flight chief should not be appointed to the EET.
2.2. (MAXWELL AFB) Commanders should designate a new EET member 30 days
before the removal of a predecessor from the team.
2.3. EET Chief. Responsible for planning and executing the base-level exercise program.
Additional duties include training EET members; developing, scheduling, conducting, and
assessing local exercises; ensuring proper coordination is accomplished between all participating
organizations (including local civilian agencies) and administering the exercise reporting
process.
   2.3.1. While performing EET duties, the EET chief is directly responsible to the installation
   commander. The EET chief will supplement this instruction. As a minimum, the supplement
   should include a list of locally authorized simulations and exercise ground rules unique to the
   installation, and a list of facilities exempt from total evacuation during exercises (such as
   facilities directly associated with flying training operations, C4 systems facilities, law
   enforcement and fire protection facilities, schools and childcare facilities, medical and dental
   facilities, and recreation, exchange, and commissary facilities). Individuals participating in
   specific activities (military court proceedings, chapel services, promotion testing, etc.) may
   also be exempt from exercise participation and local EET training requirements.
   2.3.2. Email HQ AETC/A3O as soon as possible to report any EET chief change.
   2.3.3. Brief exercise trends and/or significant findings at installation emergency management
   working group meetings.

     2.3.4. Manage the EET publications account. As a minimum, maintain or have access to the
     publications and applicable supplements listed in Attachment 1, as well as the installation
     deployment plan, security plan, base contingency response plan (CEMP 10-2), antihijacking
     plan, war and mobilization plan (WMP), and AETC WMP, Volume III,
     Mobility/Deployment; and Volume IV, General War.
2.4. EET Munitions Account. The EET chief should be familiar with the process to forecast
practice munitions according to AFI 21-201, Conventional Munitions Maintenance Management.
Note: AFCAT 21-209, Volume 1, Ground Munitions, outlines munitions available for EET use.
     2.4.1. EET chiefs should work with installation munitions accountability systems officers
     (MASO) to schedule practice ground munitions. The MASO will report the installation
     munitions request to HQ AETC/A4/7. For operations continuity, maintain expenditure data
     for at least three fiscal years.
2.5. EET Evaluators. Unit functional representatives (the EET will include at least one
representative from each installation unit). For each exercise, the EET chief will determine how
many functional areas will be involved and how many evaluators will be required (including
contractor members when first-responder contracts are in place).
2.6. Trusted Agents. Subject matter experts (SMEs) who provide exercise scenario input,
create implementers, and help develop exercises. Trusted agents may serve as controllers, and
may initiate exercise events, but will not evaluate exercises. Brief trusted agents on the
importance of protecting MAJCOM and installation exercise information. Document trusted
agent briefings.
2.7. Training. The EET chief will identify and document EET training requirements.
     2.7.1. Following appointment, the EET chief (and deputy chief, if appointed) may attend the
     Air Force Incident Management Course, if space is available. The HQ AETC Civil Engineer
     Emergency Management Branch controls course training quotas (AFI 10-2501, Table 6.1).
        2.7.1.1. EET chiefs may attend the U.S. Air Force Inspection School. HQ AETC/IG
        controls quotas.
        2.7.1.2. Installations are responsible for funding the courses.
     2.7.2. The EET chief will work with the installation Emergency Management Branch to
     conduct EET member initial and refresher training for EET-specific subjects (local policies,
     exercise planning, execution, evaluation), as required.
        2.7.2.1. EET members will complete initial training in the Advanced Distributed
        Learning System (ADLS) at https://golearn.csd.disa.mil, under Emergency
        Management. Training must be complete within 60 calendar days of appointment.
        2.7.2.2. Additional training requirements, as directed by the installation, will depend on
        each member’s functional expertise, and which exercises they will assess.
        2.7.2.3. EET members assigned to assess Air Force incident management exercises will
        receive training in accordance with AFI 10-2501 and AFMAN 32-4004, Emergency
        Response Operations.
        2.7.2.3. (MAXWELL AFB) EET evaluators must be proficient in these requirements to
        effectively evaluate performance IAW AFMAN 10-2502.
AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     9


    2.7.2.4. Readiness evaluators must be able to use the logistics module (LOGMOD) stand
    alone (LSA) as the backup deployment system, in the event LOGMOD is unavailable or
    network limitations prevent its use. (See AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and
    Execution.) Readiness evaluators will review the installation deployment plan to
    determine how LSA will be used as a back-up system during contingencies and
    inspections. Additionally, readiness evaluators will work with the installation deployment
    officer to arrange initial LSA training, which is required prior to facilitating/evaluating an
    exercise.
    2.7.2.5. The base antihijacking office of primary responsibility (OPR) will establish a
    training program to qualify EET members to assess antihijacking exercises, in accordance
    with AFI 13-207, Preventing and Resisting Aircraft Piracy (Hijacking) (FOUO). Also
    follow guidance in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Joint Order 7610.4, Special
    Operations Chapter 6, Emergency Security Control of Air Traffic.
    2.7.2.6. EET members designated to employ smoke generating devices or ground burst
    simulators must be trained and qualified on the use of the devices and on required
    protective equipment, according to AFMAN 91-201, Explosives Safety Standards.
    2.7.2.7. Trusted agents, as subject matter experts, require no training.

                                           Chapter 3

                                   EXERCISE PLANNING

3.1. Scope. Design exercises that sufficiently challenge overall installation capabilities and
emphasize local plans and procedures. Include specific local restrictions and simulation
procedures in installation exercise ground rules.
   3.1.1. Follow exercise guidelines and criteria according to all applicable Air Force guidance.
   3.1.2. Ensure exercises do not bring unfavorable publicity to the Air Force.
   3.1.3. The installation commander will determine to what extent, if any, that training will be
   interrupted.
3.2. Design and Development. Planning encompasses all aspects of design and development.
Selected EET members will work together to develop exercises for the installation exercise
program office. Individual members will contribute their functional expertise.
   3.2.1. The EET chief will coordinate with the medical unit to ensure an exercise requiring
   medical involvement does not conflict with scheduled accreditation surveys or a health
   services inspection.
   3.2.2. Check host and associate unit flying and maintenance schedules to prevent conflicts.
   3.2.3. Designate trusted agents to help develop exercises. Trusted agents will become part of
   the EET and normally contribute specific expertise to develop key aspects of an exercise.
   3.2.4. Include occupational risk management procedures experts and safety personnel in
   exercise planning.
   3.2.4. (MAXWELL AFB) Safety EET will complete occupational risk management for
   each exercise.
3.3. Security. Security is integral to exercise planning. All aspects of EET exercises should be
held in strict confidence. Some installation units need to know (medical, security forces, etc)
some exercise information. Release that information only, with the understanding that
information compromise may cause “false starts” and prevent true evaluation of an installation’s
response capability. EET chiefs should terminate an exercise if a significant compromise occurs.
3.4. Objectives:
   3.4.1. The EET chief will work with senior installation leaders to establish exercise
   objectives, in order to identify or correct problem areas and increase installation agency
   proficiency.
   3.4.2. Review MAJCOM special interest items, requirements in instructions and plans, past
   exercise reports, reports of corrective action, and operational readiness inspection (ORI)
   reports to develop objectives.
3.5. Master Scenario Events List (MSEL):
   3.5.1. A compilation of EET scripted events, depicting activities requiring participant action,
   that will be injected during the exercise. The EET develops the MSEL and participating
   agencies suggest events for inclusion.
AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     11


   3.5.2. The EET will create at least one MSEL event for each objective, determine how to
   introduce the event, and determine who would most logically cause or report the event. An
   EET designated representative will be the injector. List MSEL events by the injection date-
   time group.
3.6. Implementers. Written, detailed exercise inputs made at planned times to a specific
function or individual to support a specific MSEL item. Prepare implementers to trigger MSEL
events.
   3.6.1. In an aircraft crash scenario exercise, an implementer might be simulated radio
   communications with air traffic control (ATC) agencies describing the simulated crash to the
   control tower crew. (Example: “You see AMC 12345, a C-141, dive into the ground 1 mile
   from the approach end of runway 32 and burst into flames. Take appropriate action.”)
   3.6.2. Implementers might also portray a situation at a simulated accident site (smoke
   munitions, weapons shapes, moulaged casualties, mannequins, aircraft parts, etc.).
   Implementers are the key devices for exercise control and should contribute realism to an
   exercise.
3.7. Munitions. List in the exercise scenario all smoke-generating devices or ground-burst
simulators planned for use during an exercise. If explosives are used during an exercise, the EET
chief will prepare an inventory of devices to be used and a risk assessment, and will coordinate
with wing safety prior to use. The installation commander must approve the use of training
munitions, in accordance with AFMAN 91-201.
3.8. Coordination. The EET chief will coordinate with the base contracting office before
conducting any exercise that will delay or disrupt contract employees’ work.
   3.8.1. For exercises that may involve fire protection agencies, coordinate the exercise time
   (not the details) with the fire chief at least 30 minutes before the exercise.
   3.8.2. Brief the airfield operations flight commander at least 48 hours in advance of an
   exercise that will involve an ATC facility or airport movement area. The airfield operations
   flight commander must approve, in advance, exercises that move controllers to alternate
   facilities or shelter areas.
   3.8.3. Coordinate off-base exercises with local civil authorities/emergency planning
   committee (local governing authorities, fire department, police, sheriff, etc.). All off-base
   exercises must be coordinated through the base legal office and approved by the installation
   commander.
   3.8.4. Medical EET representatives will coordinate exercise objectives with the medical
   readiness office to ensure scenarios include events that allow completion of requirements in
   AFI 41-106, Unit Level Management of Medical Readiness, and will coordinate exercise
   scenarios and timing with the medical treatment facility (MTF) commander to help minimize
   disruption of health services delivery.
3.9. Approval. The EET chief will obtain installation commander approval before establishing
or conducting an exercise. The commander will determine appropriate levels of participation for
personnel directly involved in training operations to ensure exercises are as effective as possible
without negative impact on the primary training mission.
 12                             AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010


   3.9.1. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Activation of the base siren system must be pre-
   approved by the wing commander or vice commander and pre-approved extent (if any) of
   base gate closure.
3.10. Pre-Exercise Briefing. The EET chief will conduct a pre-exercise briefing for EET
members. EET members will not disclose briefing information to parties who do not have a need
to know. Briefing topics should include exercise scenario, date, time, and location; event timing;
agencies to be assessed; situation cards and props for use in the exercise; safety considerations;
exercise debrief time and location; and exercise communications.
AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                                      13


                                            Chapter 4

                                   EXERCISE EXECUTION

4.1. Scenario. Execute the exercise scenario on the date and time planned or as modified by the
EET chief. Once an exercise begins, it continues until all objectives have been met and, with the
EET chief’s recommendation, the installation commander terminates. Ideally, the scenario
should proceed to a logical end point. However, the EET chief or installation commander may
terminate the exercise early in the event safety concerns or conflicting real-world emergencies
arise, or when all exercise objectives are met.
4.2. Control. EET members monitor MSEL status during the exercise and inject implementers
to direct the pace. Participants may act to negate a planned event, or require an “ad hoc” event, to
keep the exercise on track. The EET chief coordinates among all controllers and adjusts MSEL
activity to meet exercise objectives. EET members ensure the exercise does not expand beyond
its planned scope.
4.3. Data Collection. EET members collect data on exercise participant actions, significant
exercise events, and other information required for after-action reports and debriefings.

                                            Chapter 5

                              EXERCISE DATA ASSESSMENT

5.1. Assessment Documents:
   5.1.1. After an exercise, the EET will assess data collected to determine if exercise
   objectives were met. Focus on exercise objectives, document results, complete a trend
   analysis (if requested by the installation commander), and provide feedback to participants.
   5.1.2. The EET chief will provide a debriefing, critique, and report for each exercise.
   Exercise grading is not required. However, if it is used, follow criteria in AFI 90-201.
5.2. Debriefings. After the exercise, the EET and trusted agents convene in a closed session to
review and assess the exercise. This initial debriefing is closed to other exercise participants to
enable evaluators and EET members to freely discuss the exercise. All findings and
recommended improvement areas will be validated with exercise participants after the EET
closed session.
   5.2.1. After the exercise, the EET chief will critique the exercise with the installation
   commander before the open session to debrief exercise participants.
   5.2.2. The EET chief will debrief participants as soon as possible; no later than 30 days after
   the exercise. The debriefing should include working level personnel when possible. The
   objective of the debriefing is to develop common dialogue between EET members and
   exercise participants.
5.3. Afteraction Report. The EET chief will prepare a formal afteraction report (AAR) for
each exercise credited toward requirements in AFI 10-2501, Table 7.1. Reports may be prepared
for other exercises conducted, but are not required. The installation commander will approve the
final report. Note: Reports required by this instruction are operating documents and thus exempt
from reports control symbol licensing requirements, according to AFI 33-324, The Information
Collections and Reports Management Program; Controlling Internal, Public, and Interagency
Air Force Information Collections.
   5.3.1. EET members will contribute to the report, and the EET chief (or designated
   representative) will consolidate inputs and produce the final report. Forward problems
   identified in the final report that the installation requires AETC to resolve. The EET chief
   will assign an OPR for each finding, and will validate all findings before publishing the
   report. In addition, the EET chief will prepare a cover memorandum that includes an exercise
   summary and its overall ratings (if used).
   5.3.2. Lessons learned should detail specific problems and resolutions or innovative
   approaches. Omit specific names, locations, or other information that identifies people or
   units. Each lesson learned should describe a problem encountered and solved (or not solved),
   and/or successful actions that can be used during future operations or exercises. Document
   lessons learned using the after action reporting lessons learned document template on the
   AETC EET CoP.
   5.3.3. Distribute after-action reports to participating agencies no later than 20 workdays after
   the exercise, and post a copy of the report on the AETC EET CoP.
AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                                  15


   5.3.4. Mark after-action reports as “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.” Note: Release reports to
   the public only to the extent required by DoD 5400.7-R, DoD Freedom of Information Act
   Program (and its Air Force and AETC supplements).
5.4. Corrective Actions. The EET recommends revised procedures to higher headquarters
based on exercise results. Do not consider discrepancies identified in after-action reports
corrected until corrective action is completed, approved by the commander or designated
representative, and validated by another exercise or test of the applicable procedure.
   5.4.1. EET Chief Responsibilities:
      5.4.1.1. Review corrective actions and identify recurring or common deficiencies (trend
      analysis).
      5.4.1.2. Track corrective actions and suspenses for follow-up actions.
      5.4.1.3. Ensure corrective actions are appropriate and correctly address problem root
      causes.
      5.4.1.4. Identify inaction and incomplete corrective actions that could not be resolved at
      a lower level to the group or wing commander (as applicable) for resolution.
      5.4.1.5. Maintain a corrective actions record for at least two years.
      5.4.1.6. Validate corrective actions during subsequent exercises.
   5.4.2. Installation Functional Manager Responsibilities. Correct discrepancies identified
   in the afteraction report, and provide a written response to the EET chief by the established
   suspense date. If functional managers (FM) cannot complete corrective actions as directed,
   they must submit followup reports at least monthly until corrective actions are complete.
   FMs will send response information copies to the Civil Engineer Readiness and Emergency
   Management Flight.
   5.4.3. Medical Functional Responsibilities. See AFI 10-204, Readiness Exercises and
   Reporting Instructions, and AFI 41-106 for information on documentation requirements.

                                           Chapter 6

                               EXERCISE REQUIREMENTS

6.1. Minimum Exercise Requirements:
   6.1.1. See AFI 10-2501, Table 7.1, for each exercise type minimum frequency. AETC
   installations may include a nuclear weapons exercise if the installation commander chooses.
   6.1.2. Complex exercise scenarios may include several individual exercises (major accident
   response, natural disaster response, etc.) in one large exercise. Each exercise may be credited
   against multiple exercise requirements if criteria for each exercise are assessed.
   6.1.3. Participation during IG inspections or other higher headquarters-directed activities
   (such as command post exercises and SAVs) that encompass a multifunctional cross-section
   of installation personnel may be credited toward overall exercise requirements. An AAR is
   required for credit.
   6.1.4. Real-world contingencies may be credited toward overall exercise requirements if the
   installation commander determines the contingency satisfies requirements.
6.2. Major Accident Response Exercise (MARE). Involves DoD material or activities of such
magnitude that the base disaster response force is required.
   6.2.1. A MARE may involve one or more of the following:
      6.2.1.1. Hazardous substances such as radioactive materials, toxic industrial chemicals,
      explosives, and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high yield explosives
      (CBRNE).
      6.2.1.2. Class A mishap.
      6.2.1.3. Extensive property damage.
      6.2.1.4. Grave risk of injury or death.
      6.2.1.5. Adverse public reaction.
   6.2.2. When conducting a MARE, include at least one (or combine several) of the following
   in the scenario:
      6.2.2.1. Conventional munitions (any nonnuclear, nonbiological, or nonchemical
      munitions).
      6.2.2.2. Chemical weapons or agents, but only if the installation stores, ships, or employs
      chemical agents or munitions.
      6.2.2.3. Hazardous material (HAZMAT).
      6.2.2.4. Radioactive material, if the installation is an Air Force fixed nuclear facility (See
      Attachment 1, Terms.)
      6.2.2.5. Nuclear weapons, if applicable. (See Attachment 1, Terms,)
      6.2.2.6. Off-base response.
      6.2.2.7. Mass casualties. (See Attachment 1, Terms.)
AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     17


       6.2.2.8. Start time that is before or after normal duty hours.
6.3. Natural Disaster Response Exercise. Assesses an installation’s ability to respond to
natural disasters likely to strike its geographic area. Natural disasters include hurricanes,
tornadoes, storms, floods, high water, wind-driven water, tidal surge, tsunamis, earthquakes,
volcanic eruptions, landslides, mudslides, severe snowstorms, drought, and other catastrophes
not caused by humans.
6.4. Terrorist use of Chemical, Biological, and Nuclear High Yield Explosives
(CBRNE). See AFI 10-2501, Table 7.1, for exercise frequency.
6.5. Operational Readiness Exercise. AETC installations conduct as prescribed in AFI 10-
2501, Table 7.1. The exercise should closely resemble the type of attack most likely to occur at
the installation (terrorist, chemical, etc.).
6.6. Deployment Exercise. Assesses an installation’s ability to effectively deploy unit type
codes in support of actual or notional war plans. Two per AEF cycle are required, according to
AFI 10-403, and its AETC supplement.
6.7. Antiterrorism Exercise. Conduct according to AFI 10-245, Air Force Antiterrorism
Standards, and its AETC supplement, and AFI 31-101, Volume 1, Air Force Installation
Security Program. The base threat working group will help develop comprehensive exercise
scenarios.
6.8. Severe Weather Response. Conduct periodically; tailor to upcoming seasonal weather
concerns, in accordance with AFI 10-229, Responding to Severe Weather Events.
6.9. Hijacking Prevention and Resistance Exercise. Exercise the installation antihijacking
plan at least annually. Follow guidance in FAA JO 7610.4. Focus on aircraft most susceptible to
hijacking. Installations without flying operations are exempt.
6.10. Medical Readiness Exercise. AFI 41-106 prescribes numerous medical readiness
exercise requirements for medical units. The EET does not specifically assess each medical
exercise, but the installation EET chief should make every effort to coordinate with the medical
EET chief to include medical exercise requirements in EET exercises. This increases realism and
reduces duplication of effort.
   6.10.1. Emergency Health Powers on Air Force Installations. As required by AFI 10-
   2603, Emergency Health Powers on Air Force Installations, the installation commander will
   organize, train, equip, and exercise personnel to conduct and sustain CBRN operations (see
   10-2501). Use every Airman as a sensor to form an effective integrated base defense
   program. The installation commander will include a public health emergency as one of an
   installation’s major exercises (i.e., mass casualty, CBRN, or biological incident) at least once
   every two years.
   6.10.2. Disease Containment Planning (DCP). When exercising disease containment,
   include mass immunization and disease containment strategies, according to Air Force and
   MAJCOM guidance. Ensure installation personnel, including tenant and geographically
   separated unit members, are trained on and prepared to execute the installation DCP.
6.11. Other Exercises. Other exercises and scenarios do not specifically require evaluation by
the EET, but may be included in EET-conducted exercises.
18                            AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010


  6.11.1. Recall. Test the base personnel recall process to ensure the commander is able to
  rapidly communicate with base personnel. Recall frequency is at the discretion of the
  installation commander.
  6.11.2. Antirobbery and Structural Fire Exercises. Security forces and the fire
  department regularly conduct anti-robbery and structural fire scenarios, which may be
  included in EET-assessed exercises.
  6.11.3. Ability to Survive and Operate (ATSO) Exercises. Unit and individual ATSO
  during emergencies or deployments are crucial to installation functions and missions.
  Conduct ATSO exercises at least twice annually. Run scenarios that test installation abilities
  to perform missions under emergency conditions, and Airmen abilities to establish and
  maintain defensive postures, administer self-aid and buddy care first aid, and operate
  effectively in emergency conditions. Scenarios may be part of a standalone ATSO exercise or
  embedded in any of the exercise categories in AFI 10-2501, Table 7.1.
     6.11.3.1. See AFMAN 10-100, Airman’s Manual, for general, core ATSO skills. In
     addition, see AFI 10-403 for quick reaction checklists that may be useful when
     conducting ATSO exercises.
     6.11.3.2. Prepare AARs to report on standalone ATSO exercises. If ATSO scenarios are
     embedded in other types of exercises, report the results as part of the main exercise AAR.
  6.11.4. Reception Exercise. Reception exercises assess an installation’s ability to
  effectively receive forces, and facilitate decisionmaking processes for successfully mission
  sustainment, as defined in Chapter 6 of the installation in-garrison expeditionary site plan,
  Part 1.
AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                                   19


                                           Chapter 7

                                EXERCISE SIMULATIONS

7.1. Simulations. Determined by local policies, contracts, and governing instructions. Rules
should allow periodic testing of all but the most sensitive procedures (such as the actual use of
narcotics). Follow guidance in AFI 10-2501. Include a list of locally approved simulations in the
installation supplement to this instruction. The installation commander will approve, in writing,
other simulations requested during an exercise. Simulation should not prevent exercise of a
function or procedure.
   7.1.1. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) All requests for simulation must be routed through the
   appropriate group commander/agency chief to the wing commander for approval. The wing
   commander may delegate simulation approval authority to the EET Chief. Use the format at
   Attachment 2 for simulation requests.
   7.1.2. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Do not simulate exercise activities not specifically
   addressed in this supplement unless actually performing the activity would result in
   significant unwarranted expenditure of time or resources, or if actual accomplishment would
   have a detrimental effect on the safety of daily operations.
   7.1.3. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate all computer outages.
   7.1.4. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate movement of vehicles with handicap stickers
   during increased FPCONs. Workaround: Vehicles with proper handicap stickers do not
   have to be moved from any handicap parking spot. Units must validate contact with owner of
   vehicle and place MAXWELLAFBVA 10-2B, Simulated Moved Handicap Vehicle, on
   vehicles that indicate simulated moved.
   7.1.5. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate movement of dumpsters during increased
   FPCONs. Workaround: Units must place MAXWELLAFBVA 10-2A, Simulated Moved
   Dumpster, on dumpsters that would otherwise be moved. Unit must explain procedure for
   dumpter removal.
   7.1.6. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate raising of bollards and closing gates during
   FPCON. Workaround: If asked, personnel will demonstrate the knowledge/ability to
   implement ISP procedures to lock bollards and close gates once. They may then be re-
   opened and simulated closed for the remainder of the exercise.
   7.1.7. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate movement of MDG patient vehicles during
   increased FPCONs. Workaround: This simulation is intended for patient parking only. Use
   of MAXWELLAFBVA 10-2D, Simulated Moved MDG Patient Vehicle, is authorized for

  7.1.18. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate contracts with off-base vendors.
  Workaround: Contracting personnel will simulate contracting off-base vendors for rental or
  purchases of services/supplies to support an exercise. In addition to preparing paperwork,
  they will provide a planned source, estimated cost, and date/time of availability when
  possible. Demonstrated contact of sources may be required if requested by the evaluator.
  7.1.19. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate use of off-base services. Workaround:
  During the FPCON/MARE exercise, do not call for off-base support unless that is part of
  normal exercise procedures. This includes services like the coroner, FBI, EOD, etc. Do not
  spend extra money for off-base services just for the exercise. Be prepared to show
  notification and reception actions; everything else may be simulated.
  7.1.20. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate use of off-base ambulance service.
  Workaround: During a MARE, do not call for off-base ambulance support unless that is
  part of normal exercise procedures. Do not spend extra money for off-base ambulance
  services. Movement of casualties to downtown/off-base facilities via off-base ambulance
  support may be simulated.
  7.1.21. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulated location for downtown hospitals will be
  Bldg 841, Health and Wellness Center (Maxwell), and Bldg 810, Medical Center (Gunter
  Annex) during MARE exercises. Casualties will be transported to these locations and
  ambulances held 20 minutes to simulate transport time.
  7.1.22. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate cordon size during MAREs. Workaround:
  All personnel will demonstrate the ability to establish the proper size cordon to EET
  inspectors and be able to describe required actions of a full cordon (i.e. evacuation of
  affected facilities). Plot full cordon, however, actual cordon may be reduced to 500 feet or
  actual size if smaller, at the discretion of the EET Chief.
  7.1.23. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate evacuation and/or other actions to minimize
  impact of cordons in Military Family Housing during MAREs. Workaround: If cordon
  includes any portion of Military Family Housing, occupants are not required to evacuate
  unless they choose to participate. If they do not evacuate, they must remain in their quarters
  until termination of the exercise.
  7.1.24. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate decontamination of contract bus driver
  transporting personnel to and from cantonment area. Workaround: Driver will be
  considered non-players during MARE exercise.

  7.1.28. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate structural response vehicle deployment
  during MARE. Workaround: During exercises requiring structural fire suppression
  responses, no more than one vehicle will be required to deploy hose lines. If one structural
  vehicle is out of service, the other will not deploy hose.
  7.1.29. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate physically removing human victims down
  ladders during aircrew extraction during MARE exercises. Workaround: On fighter and
  small frame trainer type aircraft, victims will be lifted from the seat and placed on the edge of
  the cockpit. On medium and large frame aircraft, victims will be moved to a point of exit on
  the aircraft. In all cases victims will exit the aircraft to the ground on their own. Fire
  Fighters will then continue the safe removal of victims from the fire area.
  7.1.30. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate casualty cards visible on MARE victims:
  Workaround: Emergency responders must respond to the patient’s symptoms and moulage,
  not a card. Casualty cards can be used to prepare the patients on how they should act and
  react. The use of effective exercise casualty role-play and realistic moulage shall be the
  primary indicators for all first responder and SABC evaluation. The use of casualty cards
  specifying specific signs, symptoms, and vital signs may be available on the casualty after
  medical intervention has been initiated if these more complex signs/symptoms cannot be
  moulaged or role-played effectively.
  7.1.31. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulation: Control Tower, and Supervisors of Flying
  (SOF) should accomplish appropriate checklist items short of closing the airfield and
  diverting aircraft. Workaround: Required base notifications should be made, but no action
  impacting flying operations taken.
  7.1.32. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate processing of contaminated remains during
  MARE. Workaround: Unit must demonstrate the ability to safely handle and protect
  contaminated remains. Emphasis must be placed on contamination avoidance and personal
  decontamination. Units are not required to demonstrate decontamination of human remains.
  (US Army responsibility).
  7.1.33. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate SAR Team wearing Tyvek Protective Suit
  during Search and Recovery during MARE exercies. Workaround: Due to the cost of the
  protective suits, SAR teams are not required to don these suits. Unit training suits or
  established workaround is authorized for exercise purposes.
  7.1.34. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate use of expendable medical supplies to include
  medication during MARE. Workaround: Use of expendable medical supplies will be
  simulated by the presence of training equipment or unopened items. Adequate quantities of
  materials/medication are actually available must be displayed, but conservation of those
  resources is also paramount. This includes simulation of dispensing 180-days of
  medications. Be prepared to demonstrate the capability to dispense and accomplish the
  requirement and paperwork.
  7.1.35. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulation: During exercise FPCON Bravo and higher
  situations, SF personnel will remain in 8 hour shifts and will not transition to 12 hour shifts
  unless directed by high authority. Workaround: SF personnel will remain in 8 hour shifts
  while demonstrating the capability to adequately fulfill FPCON Bravo and higher security
  posting requirements. This capability will be shown through the use of manning documents
AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                             23

                        EET EXERCISE GENERAL GUIDELINES

8.1. Overview. These guidelines apply to all EET-conducted exercise planning and execution.
See the AETC supplement to AFI 90-201 for ORI-unique inspection guidelines. Include specific,
pertinent local ground rules in the installation supplement to this instruction.
   8.1.1. EET Member Identification. The EET will have armbands, badges, or other
   distinctive identifying items marked with “EET.”
   8.1.2. Environmental Compliance. Comply with all applicable federal, state, and local
   environmental laws and standards.
   8.1.3. Operations     Security (OPSEC) and    Communications     Security
   (COMSEC). Follow OPSEC and COMSEC guidance in accordance with AFI 10-701,
   Operations Security (OPSEC).
   8.1.4. Radios and Cellular Phones . Comply with AFI 33-106, Managing High Frequency
   Radios, Personal Wireless Communication Systems, and the Military Affiliate Radio System,
   when using intrabase radios and/or cellular phones.
   8.1.5. Priority Resource Penetration. Exercise scenarios, including attempts to penetrate
   protection level resources, must be closely coordinated with security forces. For such
   exercises, a security forces EET member should be at the exercise scenario location.
   8.1.6. Weapon-Loaded Aircraft . Do not conduct simulated accidents closer than 1,000
   feet from a weapon-loaded aircraft.
   8.1.7. Munitions. Comply with AFMAN 91-201 when using exercise munitions.
   8.1.8. Props and Implementers. Exercise props and implementers should conform as
   closely as possible to the actual item they represent. Use mockups, condemned supplies,
   equipment, moulage kits, and actual documents to enhance realism.
       8.1.8.1. Document Markings. Mark internal EET exercise control documents,
       “CONTROL EYES ONLY.” Prominently mark exercise documents, forms, publications,
       and messages that are intended for player action as “EXERCISE” or “FOR EXERCISE
       USE ONLY.” Prepare required exercise messages, but do not transmit. Give required
       operational reports in writing to the EET.
       8.1.8.2. Status Cards. Status cards may be used to provide the simulated status of
       equipment or facilities involved in exercises. Use damage cards to indicate the damage of
       equipment, weapons, buildings, or facilities. Display the cards prominently or give them
       to exercise participants.
   8.1.9. Exercise Communications . Begin and end all exercise communications with a
   phrase to indicate it is an exercise communication. (Example: “This is an exercise,”
   “Exercise transmission,” or “Exercise message.”)
       8.1.9.1. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Simulate notification or coordination with agencies
       outside the 42 ABW by calling the EET SWITCH. Prepare all required reports and
AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                                     25


       submit to the CAT or EOC director. DO NOT transmit any reports off station, unless
       directed by higher headquarters.
8.2. Safety and Security Violations. If a potential or actual safety or security violation is
observed, EET members and/or exercise participants must take immediate action to prevent
personal injury, damage to equipment, or release of classified information.
   8.2.1. If an actual accident occurs or a person is injured during an exercise, any EET
   member may delay or terminate the entire exercise and give necessary aid. Preface any radio
   or telephone transmission with “This is a real-world emergency.”
   8.2.1. (MAXWELL AFB) King’s X, repeat King’s X for real world emergency during
   exercies.
   8.2.2. If an actual emergency develops while an exercise is in progress, the EET chief,
   incident commander, or installation commander may delay or terminate the exercise as
   necessary.
   8.2.3. Watch supervisors and senior controllers may interrupt or discontinue ATC facility
   participation in any exercise if flight safety is in question, or an exercise interferes with
   recovery of emergency aircraft.
       8.2.3.1. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) The Fire Department will keep sufficient fire-
       fighting equipment on the flight line to support flying operations during exercises (if
       active flying is in progress).
   8.2.4. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Use actual surface winds for all exercises, unless
   directed otherwise.
8.2. (MAXWELL AFB) EET badges or vest do not constitute authority to enter
controlled/restricted areas or grant access to classified information.
8.3. Personnel Recall. Do not recall people from leave or temporary duty. Do not use
simulations to overcome personnel shortfalls except for individuals who would normally be
recalled. (Example: Personnel on leave or TDY who could be recalled and would arrive in time
to participate.)
8.4. Base Evacuation. Simulate base evacuation.
8.5. Building Evacuation. In the installation supplement to this instruction, include a list of
facilities exempt from total evacuation during exercises. Restrict the facilities to essential
personnel and people who have legitimate business within a facility. Personnel conducting
business when an evacuation is directed may conclude their business, but must remain in the
facility until the evacuation portion of the exercise is complete. Check evacuation plans for these
facilities and question assigned personnel to make sure they know how to evacuate during an
exercise.
8.6. Aircraft Movement. Moving aircraft during exercises will be done at the installation
commander’s discretion. For installations with more than one wing, this applies to the “owning”
wing commander.
   8.6.1. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Airfield Operations.
 26                            AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010


       8.6.1.1. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Air Traffic Controllers and Base Operations
       personnel should not simulate the effects of exercise scenarios on normal daily
       operations. Carry out appropriate status changes, runway/taxiway closures, Notice to
       Airmen (NOTAM) transmissions, etc., until directed otherwise by the EET evaluator. Do
       not transmit exercise NOTAMs--deliver to the EET Switch or EET Team. Consider
       transmitting "real-world" NOTAMs describing potential delays or other effects of an
       exercise in progress. The OSF/CC has the authority to override all exercise inputs in
       order to maintain safe control of resources.
       8.6.1.2. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) EET members will not direct the movement of
       aircraft or distract controllers. EET will pass inputs through the tower EET or tower
       supervisor.
       8.6.1.3. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) Runways will remain available for emergency
       aircraft recoveries. This may require the EET to artificially relocate emergency response
       crews, the entry control point, and or cordon guards. Players should respond as though
       the situation was real until directed otherwise by the EET.
       8.6.1.4. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) No exercise should cause any aircraft to divert.
       Plan runway/taxiway closures for a duration allowing the wing to demonstrate
       capabilities without causing aircraft movement problems.
       8.6.1.5. (Added-MAXWELL AFB) All towing operations will follow all real world
       safety and Technical Order guidance. For simulated towing, connect to the aircraft; then
       disconnect, and proceed to the appropriate evacuation area as if the aircraft were in tow.
       For simulated taxi operations, have all necessary equipment available (such as a power
       unit) and have qualified personnel available at the aircraft.
8.7. Individual Protective Equipment. During exercises, all individual protective equipment
(including protective masks) will be worn as appropriate for the situation. Exceptions: 1)
Equipment is unavailable; 2) Wear of protective equipment would create an unsafe condition.
   8.7.1. Personnel driving government vehicles will wear chemical warfare equipment
   (including masks, when required) consistent with safety standards.
   8.7.2. Do not wear masks when driving off base or operating a privately owned vehicle.
   8.7.3. Pregnant women are not required to wear chemical warfare equipment during
   exercises.
   8.7.4. ATC personnel will follow AFI 13-203, Air Traffic Control, guidance on wearing
   protective equipment during exercises.
8.8. Shelter Operations. Accomplish shelter operations as completely as possible according to
the threat, prudent cost benefit, and logistics limits.
8.9. Medical Personnel. During any exercise, the MTF commander may withhold or withdraw
medical personnel if required to respond to an actual medical emergency. With the installation
commander’s approval, the MTF commander may also withhold or withdraw medical personnel
to avoid adversely affecting scheduled patient care.
AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010                                                   27


8.10. Air Force Civilians. Emergency essential Air Force civilians may participate as specified
in AFI 36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Workforce, and at the discretion of the installation
commander. Approval of civilian overtime is at the installation commander’s discretion.
8.11. Contractors. Contractors who do not have contingency or readiness requirements are
exempt from exercise participation. Contractor personnel will still obey the lawful orders of
responding forces.
   8.11.1. Do not exercise functions being performed under contract unless the exercise
   requirements are established in the contract. When contracted services could affect exercise
   outcome, make sure assessments explain the need for these services, by contract or
   otherwise, during crises. Contact the contracting officer technical representative and
   installation contracting squadron to revise the contract, if necessary.
   8.11.2. Report performance or contract deficiencies simultaneously to the contract
   administrator, quality assurance evaluator, and contractor. If exercise scenarios will incur
   costs beyond those required in the contract, inform the contracting officer immediately to
   determine a course of action.
8.12. Emergency Vehicles. Fire vehicles must follow guidance in AFI 32-2001, Fire
Emergency Services Program.
8.13. HAZMAT. Use procedures in AFJI 11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft
Carrying Hazardous Materials, when simulating radio calls from aircraft carrying HAZMAT.
8.14. Nuclear Weapons Accident Scenarios. Use line numbers in TO 11N-20-11(C), General
Firefighting Guidance (U), when communicating during nuclear weapon accident scenarios.
8.15. Requests for Support or Coordination. Unless tasking instructions direct otherwise,
during an exercise, send requests for support or coordination that which would normally go to
higher headquarters or off-base agencies to the EET for resolution.
8.16. Traffic Control. When responding to exercise situations, vehicle operators must abide by
posted speed limits and traffic control devices.
8.17. Rental and Purchase of Equipment. During an exercise, prepare the paperwork for
vehicles, equipment, or supplies that would be rented or purchased in a real world situation, but
do not process it. The EET should gather the paperwork to simulate passing to higher
headquarters.
8.18. EET Perpetrator Actions:
   8.18.1. Safety is paramount during exercises. EET perpetrators will obey all orders from
   responding security forces.
   8.18.2. EET perpetrators may attempt to passively evade or hide from exercise participants,
   but they must comply with orders upon detection. Perpetrators may not attempt to flee,
   struggle against, or otherwise try to escape the response force.
   8.18.3. Perpetrators may remove outward items that identify them as EET members.
   However, they will carry identification to prove they are EET members if identification is
   requested.
   8.18.4. Use of actual weapons or blank ammunition is prohibited.
 28                             AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010


   8.18.5. Perpetrators will not openly display a weapon, or simulated weapon, or use it in a
   threatening manner. (Note: A simulated weapon is anything that looks like a real weapon
   (toy guns and knives, air guns, etc.).) Simulated weapons will only be used to assess the
   thoroughness of a body search. Simulated weapons will be painted or otherwise altered to
   change the authentic appearance and color. Mark simulated weapons as “training aids.”
   8.18.6. Perpetrators will not make any threatening action toward responding forces.
8.19. Additional Medical Personnel Deployment Guidelines. EET will ensure the MTF has
at least 60 days notification prior to an exercise in order to minimize impact on patient access to
care. The medical EET member will provide the MTF commander with relevant exercise dates to
enable the facility to adjust patient appointments in a timely, appropriate manner.

Terms
Associate Unit—An Air Force, AFRC, or ANG organization or element that occupies the
facilities of, or receives support from, another MAJCOM, AFRC, or ANG component.
C4 Systems Facilities—Facilities that house command, control, communications, and computer
(C4) systems critical to the installation’s mission or operation. Examples include automated data
processing systems, communications systems, base-wide local area network systems, and
navigational aids, as well as utilities critical to operating these facilities.
Class A (Mishap)—A mishap resulting in one or more of the following: 1) Reportable damage
of $1 million or more; 2) A fatality or permanent total disability [due to injury or occupational
illness, e.g., medical discharge, separation, or nonmedically induced comatose]; 3) Destruction
of an Air Force aircraft, spacecraft, or missile during launch. Aircraft will be considered
destroyed when the man-hours required to repair the aircraft exceed the maximum stated in the
"major repair man-hours" column of TO 1-1-638, Repair and Disposal of Aerospace Vehicles.
Communications Security (COMSEC)—(DoD) The protection resulting from all measures
designed to deny unauthorized persons information of value that might be derived from the
possession and study of telecommunications, or to mislead unauthorized persons in their
interpretation of the results of such possession and study. Communications security includes
crypto security, transmission security, emission security, and physical security of
communications security materials and information as follows:
Crypto security—The provision of technically sound cryptosystems and their proper use.
Transmission security—All measures designed to protect transmissions from interception and
exploitation by means other than cryptanalysis.
Emission security—All measures taken to deny unauthorized persons information of value that
might be derived from intercept and analysis of compromising emanations from crypto-
equipment and telecommunications systems.
Physical security—All physical measures necessary to safeguard classified equipment, material,
and documents from access thereto or observation thereof by unauthorized person
Contingency—An event or series of events resulting from international or political instabilities,
or other unforeseen disasters of natural or human origin.
Deployment—The relocation of forces to designated areas of operations.
Fixed Nuclear Facility—Stationary nuclear installations that use or produce radioactive
materials in their normal operations. Within the Air Force, these facilities include installations
with nuclear weapons or radioactive materials in sufficient quantities that the general public
might be affected if an accident involving the radioactive materials occurred. It also includes
facilities using NRC-regulated radioactive materials above thresholds in the Code of Federal
Regulations, Schedule C (10 CFR 30.72) for specific emergency plans. Normally, facilities using
 32                              AETCI10-205_MAXWELLAFBSUP_I 4 NOVEMBER 2010


radioactive materials in their operations (such as medical, calibration, and radiography) and
radioactive materials in shipments are not included in this definition.
Host Unit—The organization designated by the host MAJCOM or headquarters Air Force, to
provide support to an associate unit.
Incident Commander—The person designated to coordinate rescue efforts at a rescue site; the
senior onsite member, normally the installation support group commander or designated
representative. All disaster response force members at an accident scene are under the command
and control of the incident commander.
Lesson Learned—A problem encountered and corrected; a problem for which no solution was
found; a successful action noted for future operations.
LOGMOD—The system of record for unit logistics readiness organizations. LOGMOD is a
computer software program that runs on computers at both the major command and base level, or
through networked services. It is used to manage a database containing the logistics equipment
and supplies for Air Force unit type codes (UTCs).
Mass Casualties—When a situation exceeds the patient care capabilities of the medical force in
place or when base medical services are faced with the necessity of caring for an influx of
casualties. For exercises, use 10 or more casualties as a baseline.
Master Scenario Events List (MSEL)—A list of sequentially numbered events that direct
exercises toward desired objectives.
Nuclear Weapon Accident—An unexpected event involving nuclear weapons or radiological
nuclear weapon components, resulting in any of the following:
   - U.S. forces’ or U.S. supported/allied forces’ accidental or unauthorized launching, firing, or
   use of a nuclear capable weapon system that could create the risk of an outbreak of war
   - Nonnuclear detonation or burning of a nuclear weapon or radiological nuclear weapon
   component.
   - Radioactive contamination.
   - Seizure, theft, loss, or destruction of a nuclear weapon or radiological nuclear weapon
   component, including jettisoning.
   - Public hazard, actual or implied.
Operating Document—A completed form or other document used to facilitate, accomplish, or
provide a description or record of a transaction, function, or event. The information in an
operating document may provide data or input for a report, but that is not its primary purpose.
Operation Plan—A plan for one or more operations that deployed units carry out
simultaneously or in a series of connected stages. Higher authorities normally issue operation
plans as directives, based on stated assumptions, to allow subordinates to prepare supporting
plans and orders.
Operations Security (OPSEC)—(DoD) A process of identifying critical information and
subsequently analyzing friendly actions attendant to military operations and other activities to: a.
identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems; b. determine
indicators that hostile intelligence systems might obtain that could be interpreted or pieced
together to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries; and c. select and

execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of friendly
actions to adversary exploitation.
Trusted Agent—A subject matter expert who provides input to exercise scenarios, creates
implementers, and assists exercise planners in exercise development. Trusted agents may also be
used as controllers.
Unit Type Code—A standard five-digit code that uniquely identifies similar types of military
organizations.
10 CFR 30.72—Schedule lists quantities of radioactive materials requiring consideration of the
need for an emergency plan for responding to a release.
