   are conceived and led by AFRL military and/or civilians, where the research is
 4                                                                   AFRLI61-102 3 APRIL 2014


     predominantly conducted at AFRL facilities by AFRL Government and on-site contractor
     research personnel. The objective is to achieve a critical mass of effort in select high-priority
     areas. Proposals are submitted in response to a set of topics linked to Air Force Science and
     Technology (S&T) strategic guidance. CRDF projects are multi-year projects of up to three
     years duration with the ability to exceed three years at the discretion of the Category 1
     owner. The TDs are highly encouraged to propose projects requiring cross TD collaboration.
     Collaborative cross-TD proposals shall generally be favored over single TD proposals.
     3.2. Category 2: Transition of Technologies into Operational Use.          These projects are
     initiated in response to urgent needs from Combatant Commands, Acquisition Centers, and
     Major Commands, IAW AFRLI 90-104, Volume 3, AFRL Core Process 3, Innovative
     Solutions to Near-Term Needs. Once the determination is made that a suitable technology
     enabled solution exists, a Rapid Reaction project is executed to develop and deliver a
     prototype solution within 12 months, transitioning the existing technology to operational use.
     3.3. Category 3: Workforce Development.
        3.3.1. Workforce development is critical in recruiting, training, developing, and retaining
        personnel for addressing the critical science and technology areas to meet the future DOD
        requirements for providing cutting-edge capabilities to the MAJCOMs. Approved
        projects include increasing the skills of the current workforce, recruiting the future
        workforce, providing science, technology, engineering and mathematics education
        outreach opportunities supporting AFRL recruiting strategies and Institute activities.
        3.3.2. Institutes: Institutes are defined as not-for-profit corporations devoted to
        knowledge in aerospace science, technology, engineering and design integration for air
        and space applications. They increase the skills of the current workforce by facilitating
        the building of effective collaborations leveraging a variety of resources from
        universities, small businesses, other industry and the Air Force to solve challenging real-
        world S&T mission needs.
     3.4. Category 4: Revitalizing Laboratory Facilities. AFRL depends on state-of-the-art S&T
     facilities and must exercise responsible stewardship of those facilities. The objective is to
     provide essential infrastructure for S&T research of AFRL high-priority areas and
     requirements; stakeholder interest; capabilities to satisfy new mission requirements; and for
     environmental, safety and security considerations. Section 219 allows for both revitalization
     and recapitalization of AFRL facilities with an emphasis on cross-TD collaboration to
     maximize Section 219 Program authority.
4. Category Process Flow.
     4.1. Category Budget and Project Selection Process.
        4.1.1. At the start of the new fiscal year, AFRL/CA will convene a Category Owners
        roundtable meeting to discuss the FFY Section 219 Program. The discussion will focus
        on the Section 219 Program and its alignment to the Commander’s Intent and the
        Corporate Investment Strategy. The results of this roundtable, for AFRL/CC approval,
        are a program budget, Enterprise cross category project focus areas for TD proposal
        solicitation and project selection criteria.
AFRLI61-102 3 APRIL 2014                                                                          5


     4.1.2. Category 2 project selection processes will be done IAW AFRLI 90-104, Volume
     3, AFRL Core Process 3, Innovative Solutions to Near-Term Needs.
     4.1.3. After approval of the funds allocated to each category, the Section 219 PM will
     send a consolidated proposal request to the TDs for Category 1, 3 and 4 project
     proposals. The request for proposals to the TDs occurs no later than March prior to the
     FFY. See Figure 4.1 for the Section 219 schedule.
     4.1.4. Total time for developing Category 1, 3, and 4 proposals, and approval by the
     Category owners, will be no more than sixty (60) days from the date of the project
     proposal request. See Figure 4.1 for timeline.
     4.1.5. AFRL/CA will convene a second roundtable meeting to finalize the FFY Section
     219 Program for AFRL/CC approval. The Section 219 PM prepares the integrated
     Section 219 project proposal package for AFRL/CC approval. After AFRL/CC approval,
     the Section 219 PM informs the category owners, the TDs and AFRL/FM of the
     approved projects within thirty (30) days after this meeting. See Figure 4.1 for the
     Section 219 schedule.
  4.2. Project Management Process.
     4.2.1. The TD of the successful project must provide the Section 219 PM with a spend
     plan within fifteen (15) days of project award notification. The TD will provide monthly
     execution updates to the Section 219 PM.
     4.2.2. An annual Section 219 PMR will be scheduled nominally in late May to early June
     and be conducted in 2 parts.
         4.2.2.1. AFRL/XP will conduct the financial execution review to determine that the
         OSD and AFRL obligation and expenditure goals are being met. Projects that are
         experiencing lagging financial execution issues prior to the project’s scheduled
         completion will be appropriately adjusted in coordination with AFRL/XP and the
         Category owners. Consensus actions based on the execution review will be provided
         to AFRL/CA.
         4.2.2.2. The Category owners will conduct a technical review of each project in their
         category. The purpose of the category owner technical review portion of the PMR is
         to measure the soundness of the technical approach and technical rigor used in
         conducting the research to achieve the technical objective(s) of the project. The
         Research Council, AFRL/DP and the Deputies Council will provide feedback during
         the review or through separate means after the review to the Project’s PI and/or POC
         on the Cat1, Cat3 and Cat4 projects respectively. Projects experiencing technical
         issues affecting the project’s completion timeline will be discussed for remedial
         actions in coordination with the Section 219 PM. The Category Owner will make
         recommendations for actions based on the technical portion of the PMR to
         AFRL/CA.
  4.3. Project Reporting Process.
     4.3.1. Each Section 219 project is required to submit an annual report and a final report.
     4.3.2. Each TD must establish a process to report these projects to the Section 219 PM.

      4.3.3. The Section 219 PM will send an AFRL Workflow data call to all TDs for the
      annual report. The data call will include specific instructions for said report.
      4.3.4. A comprehensive Final Report is due to the Section 219 PM no later than 90 days
      from the completion of the work or at 100% expenditure of the Section 219 funding.
      Final Report delinquency will be considered in all future Section 219 Project awards
      proposed by the delinquent project Lead PI or POC.
