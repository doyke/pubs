the Coast Guard when it is operating as a Military Service in the Navy), the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, the Combatant Commands, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense
(IG DoD), the Defense Agencies, the DoD Field Activities and all other organizational entities within
the Department of Defense (hereafter referred to collectively as the “DoD Components”) and their Non-

missions using separate and distinct resources for which they are accountable to different Governmental
agencies, e.g., the Department of Defense and the USPS. The DoD OMP involves the mailing of
official mail and is managed to support the overall DoD mission. The military postal service function
processes personal mail to and from overseas DoD Installations, operates on behalf of the USPS, and is
responsible for carrying out USPS policies, procedures, and laws and regulations governing the USPS.

(Reference (g)).

       5.3.4. Ensure official mail management training is available.

       5.3.5. Be the single point of contact with the General Services Administration, the USPS, and

                                              DoD OMP


E4.1. PURPOSE

This enclosure establishes:

     E4.1.1. The basic DoD OMP policies.

     E4.1.2. The requirement for appointing OMMs and describes their duties.

E4.2. OMP POLICIES

        E4.2.1. Users shall budget for and pay for postage. See DoD Instruction 4000.19 (Reference
(q)) for reimbursement policies.

        E4.2.1. (Added)(AF) Air Force defines users to be either a wing or tenant unit.

           E4.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) All tenant units will reimburse host wings for postage
expenditures. Installation commanders have the option to require some wing organizations to
reimburse or pay for official mail postage regardless of the amount. For the purpose of OM
postage reimbursement, Medical Treatment Facilities are considered wing organizations.
Installation commanders may establish reimbursement threshold amounts. Most DoD agencies
waive reimbursement and defer billing between agencies when postage expenditures are less than
$500 in a fiscal year. Therefore, a $500 threshold is recommended as a baseline. Smaller
installations shall consider establishing a lower threshold. If the threshold is exceeded, the full
amount is reimbursable, not only the amount exceeding the threshold. Geographically Separated
Units (GSU) locations that provide official mail support will follow the host wing’s guidance.

           E4.2.1.2. (Added)(AF) Activity or Base/Wing OMMs track all official mail
expenditures of tenant units to provide quarterly usage figures to their resource advisor to initiate
reimbursement. Installation Commanders may require expenditure tracking of specific (large
mailer) installation or tenant units. Official mailings must still comply with DoD 4525.8-
M_AFMAN 33-306, DoD Official Mail Manual, restrictions. OMM will work with the host tenant
support agreement office to ensure they identify those agencies at/or supported by their base to
ensure official mail costs are included in all host tenant support agreements. Unit Resource
Advisors will maintain copies of billings and ensure funds for postage are deposited into the
appropriate postage account. The OMM will maintain quarterly listings or logs with quarterly
postage reports and dispose of them in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition
Schedule located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.

       E4.2.2. DoD activities shall use prepaid postage. Information on how to pay for it is in section
C2.7 of Reference (d). Exception: Instructions on when to use Postage Due Penalty Mail are in section
C2.14.


                                                                                       ENCLOSURE 5
11                                                            DODI4525.08_AFI33-365, 31 MAY 2011

       E4.2.2. (Added)(AF) OMC may use PC Postage (postage downloaded from a USPS
licensed vendor site on the Internet) or government purchase card to pay for USPS postage. All
purchases/expenditures must be reported in accordance with this Instruction.

        E4.2.3. All policies requiring or authorizing use of official mail shall be coordinated with the
activity's OMM prior to publication.

        E4.2.4. Deductions from USPS trust accounts and electronic billings shall be verified to make
sure they are valid, accurate, and not a duplicate entry.

       E4.2.4. (Added)(AF) OMMs shall work with budget/finance personnel to verify billing.

         E4.2.5. If there is a consolidated mail facility in the area, all outgoing non-production mail shall
be processed through that facility unless the facility determines it is unable to provide service or the
originating activity can demonstrate it is not cost-effective to do so and/or mail transit times will
increase. If there is no consolidated mail facility in the area, there shall be only one processing point for
all non-production outgoing mail on an installation. A production mailer is one who routinely produces
large volumes of parcels or other items. Examples are supply warehouses and correspondence course
activities. Production mailers' non-production mail shall go through the central processing point.
Justified requests for exception shall be forwarded through command channels to the DoD Component
OMM who may or may not approve them after considering each on an individual case-by-case basis.
Lower command levels may disapprove and return such requests. The dollar amount of postage
involved is not a basis for justification. Maintaining optimum use of personnel, equipment, floor space,
and cost-reduction practices such as consolidated mailings, barcode and presort discounts, permit
mailings, and drop-shipments are essential.

       E4.2.6. Official mail must be considered an integral part of an activity's transportation plan and
function when considering how to transport an item.

       E4.2.6. (Added)(AF) All OMMs must ensure Private Express Statute (PES) requirements
are enforced. PES requirements must be considered when developing contracts.

       E4.2.7. Instances of Unauthorized use, loss, or theft of appropriated fund postage shall be
reported and reviewed to determine whether to seek reimbursement of postage costs.

       E4.2.7. (Added)(AF) Local and MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU legal reviews are required prior
to forwarding contested requests to use appropriated funds for official mail mailings to the AF
and DOD OMM.

        E4.2.8. Only surplus USPS equipment may be used for the internal distribution of mail or other
DoD purposes. Only enough empty USPS mailbags, trays, boxes, carts, and other equipment items
necessary to meet immediate outgoing mail needs shall be kept on hand. Promptly return additional
quantities to the local post office.

        E4.2.8. (Added)(AF) OMCs must budget for, purchase, or lease official meter bases,
scales, vehicles, etc. Official meters may only be leased. USPS scales and Integrated Retail
Terminal (IRT) equipment are not authorized in OMCs.

        E4.2.9. When application of postage is contracted out, the contract's work statement shall
require compliance with the policies and procedures in this enclosure and any subsequent changes
thereto. The contract's quality assurance surveillance plan shall be designed to make sure the contractor
complies with this enclosure.

       E4.2.10. Senders shall mark the appropriate class of mail on all items larger than a letter-size
envelope. Prior to applying postage, official mail centers receiving items larger than a letter-size
envelope that are not so marked shall return them to the sender for marking or contact the sender to
determine the nature of the contents so the item can be properly marked.

      E4.2.10. (Added)(AF) OMCs will send unmarked items at the most cost effective rate of
postage or with the most cost effective carrier, except items required to be mailed at the first class
rate.

         E4.2.11. Combatant Commanders operations or exercise plans shall indicate that during the
initial deployment phases of a exercise or contingency postage requirements, equipment, personnel and
facilities for processing of official and internal mail and the transportation of internal mail within the
affected area shall be the responsibility of the host unit/base, regardless of branch of their DoD
Component on a non-reimbursable basis. Additionally, these plans should contain official mail
operating procedures to include funding guidance. Upon sustainment or when personnel rotations take
place, paragraph E4.2.1 of this Instruction will apply for postage procurement and usage. Combatant
Commanders may establish quarterly minimums that would not require reimbursement.

       E4.2.12. When mail is to be delivered it shall be considered as:

             E4.2.12.1. Personal mail when the address contains an individual's name but does not have a
job title or the name is not in an attention line.

          E4.2.12.1. (Added)(AF) OMC personnel or organizations may never open personally
addressed mail.

            E4.2.12.2. Official mail when it is addressed to an organization or the address contains an
individual's name and duty title or the name is in an attention line. Upon receipt from the USPS, this
mail becomes the property of the organization to which it is addressed. The addressee usually opens this
mail but it may be opened by anyone in the organization unless local policy states otherwise.
Unsolicited and unwanted presorted standard mail may be disposed of as the organization desires. It
need not be returned to the post office. If such mail bears an endorsement such as “Address Service
Requested” or “Forwarding Service Requested” write the new address on it or mark it “Undeliverable
As Addressed” and return it to the post office. Doing so normally reduces the future quantity of
undeliverable as addressed mail received.

       E4.2.13. Anything that requests someone to provide an address shall include a place for an
apartment, suite, or other secondary unit designator number.



                                                                                          ENCLOSURE 5
13                                                           DODI4525.08_AFI33-365, 31 MAY 2011

        E4.2.14. All business cards, organizational sections of telephone directories, and publicity items
shall include the correct street address instead of building numbers. This helps reduce the amount of
mail received that is undeliverable as addressed.

      E4.2.15. OMMs and official mail center managers shall have Internet access so they can access
the USPS Home Page.

        E4.2.16. OMMs and official mail center managers shall have an e-mail address so information
can be rapidly distributed. Generic addresses for these functions are preferred so address lists need not
be changed when personnel change.

      E4.2.16. (Added)(AF) Generic addresses are organizational email addresses. MAJCOM,
FOA, or DRU and installation OMMs shall have organizational email accounts. MAJCOM
OMMs must ensure their installation OMMs check their email regularly.

        E4.2.17. USPS inspections, search procedures, and postal laws apply to official matter only
while it is mail. OMMs and assistant OMMs (AOMM) may inspect or withdraw:

       E4.2.17. (Added)(AF) To be considered mail, items must be in the custody of USPS or the
military postal service (MPS). Personal mail must be afforded all lawful privileges while in official
mail custody.

           E4.2.17.1. Outgoing official mail items.

               E4.2.17.1.1. Before they are postmarked by a postage meter.

              E4.2.17.1.2. Bearing postage stamps or permit imprints before they are placed in a USPS
mailbox or placed under control of USPS or its representative, whichever occurs first.

               E4.2.17.1.2. (Added)(AF) An official mail item sent between two action offices on
the same base through the OMC is referred to as administrative communication. Administrative
communications that remain in the OMC for on-base distribution are not handled by USPS and
therefore will not have postage applied.

           E4.2.17.2. Incoming official mail items after control passes from USPS or its representative
to representatives of the addressee.

            E4.2.17.2. (Added)(AF) OMC personnel acting as the mail agent for all official
activities on the installation, may sign for all official accountable mail. USPS considers official
mail delivered when OMC personnel accept it.

     E4.2.18. (Added)(AF) Individual units shall only dispatch or receive mail through the
OMC (exceptions are authorized for units that are geographically separated from an installation).
OMCs shall consolidate collocated units’ mail to decrease duplication, number of ADO’s, and
number of mobile distribution vehicle (MDV) stops.



                                                                                          ENCLOSURE 5

     E4.2.19. (Added)(AF) Installations shall utilize MDVs to pick up and deliver mail to
ADOs. MDVs save manpower, cost, and time.


E4.3. OMMs

     E4.3.1. OMM Appointments

        E4.3.1.1. Installations, units, staff elements, and the DoD Components shall appoint OMMs.
AOMMs may be appointed to perform the OMM duties when the OMM is absent. The appointments
may be additional duty appointments. They shall be made in writing and shall include the appointees'
official USPS and email addresses and telephone numbers. Paper or electronic copies will be distributed
as follows:

           E4.3.1.1.1. For staff element OMMs, copies are sent to their installation OMM.

           E4.3.1.1.1. (Added)(AF) The staff element OMM is referred to as the Activity
Distribution Office (ADO) . ADOs exchange mail and distribution for multiple units/organizations
at designated MDV stops. The requirement to appoint OMMs in the grade of Technical
Sergeant/GS-6 or higher, does not apply to ADOs. Unit or organizational mail clerks are
appointed in writing and copies maintained at the staff agency/ADO and organization. Use AF
Form 4332, Accountable Communications Receipt Authorization, to appoint ADOs.

           E4.3.1.1.2. For installation OMMs, copies are sent to their next higher command's OMM.

           E4.3.1.1.2. (Added)(AF) The Installation OMM is the host base or host wing OMM in
charge of the OMC.

           E4.3.1.1.3. For tenant unit OMMs, copies are sent to their host installation OMM.

          *E4.3.1.1.3. (Added)(AF) Tenant units on Air Force installations send to the staff
element or installation OMM. AF A3CX/A6CX (Chief, Postal Operations and Policy) is the Air
Force Official Mail Manager (AF OMM). MAJCOMS, FOAs, and DRUs will identify their
OMMs and any contact information changes to the AF OMM via email as changes occur. AF
OMM updates this consolidated list and distributes to MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU OMMs when
changes occur and upon request.

           E4.3.1.1.4. For major command/claimant OMMs, copies are sent to their DoD Component
OMM.

          E4.3.1.1.4 (Added)(AF) MAJCOMS, FOAs, and DRUs will identify their OMMs and
any contact information changes to the Air Force OMM (AF OMM) via email as changes occur.
AF OMM updates this consolidated list and distributes to MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU OMMs
when changes occur and upon request.

           E4.3.1.1.5. For DoD Component OMMs, copies are sent to:


                                                                                      ENCLOSURE 5
15                                                          DODI4525.08_AFI33-365, 31 MAY 2011

                Alexandria, VA 22331-0006
        E4.3.1.2. The OMM function is an inherently governmental function. OMMs are responsible
for interpreting and carrying out the Private Express Statues within their organization; the acquisition,
use or disposition of supplies and property; and the budgeting for and the expenditure of appropriated
funds for postage and fees. Only commissioned, warrant, or noncommissioned officers (E-6 or higher)
or DoD civilians (GS-6 or higher) shall be appointed as OMMs. This requirement is waived only when
the activity concerned has no personnel in the grades specified. Since the OMM function is an
inherently governmental function it shall not be contracted out.

        E4.3.1.2. (Added)(AF) AFSC or job series is not a consideration when appointing OMMs.

       E4.3.1.3. When application of postage is contracted out, the DoD Component's representative
responsible for ensuring quality of performance by the contractor shall:

           E4.3.1.3.1. Meet all requirements and perform the functions of the OMM.

           E4.3.1.3.2. Use the contract's quality assurance surveillance plan to monitor the quality of
contractor performance and make sure DoD official mail policies and procedures are followed.

        E4.3.1.4. Frequent changes of OMMs shall be avoided. When changes are necessary, enough
overlap should be provided so that the new OMM becomes thoroughly familiar with the duties before
the old OMM departs.

     E4.3.2. OMP Training Requirements

        E4.3.2.1. Action officers; secretaries; clerk-typists; personnel producing forms, publications and
periodicals; personnel who determine postage; and OMMs shall receive training on the following
subjects from the installation OMM within 4 months after assignment. These personnel and all action
officers shall receive annual updates.

        E4.3.2.1. (Added)(AF) The Installation OMM is responsible for training all assigned ADO
representatives (military and civilian). The OMM may elect to contract ADO training as long as
the OMM ensures all training is applicable, accurate, and documented. The ADO is the focal
point for continuous unit training (e.g., administrative assistants or action offices). Provide
refresher training as needed. Training will be documented and may be conducted by PowerPoint
presentation, web-based information instruction, pamphlets, hands-on training, instruction
letters, or a combination thereof. All Air Force official mail centers will provide a copy of their
training plan/materials to their MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU OMM. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU
OMMs will ensure training is adequate and fulfills the intent of this enclosure and will develop
training templates for subordinate OMCs’ use.


            E4.3.2.1.1. Other methods of communicating and shipping material. This includes the use of
private carriers.
                                                                                         ENCLOSURE 5

           E4.3.3.2.3. Annually contact, offer assistance, guidance, training, and discuss mailing
requirements with activities within their jurisdiction that produce forms, publications and periodicals, or
are involved with contingency or similar planning. A record of these discussions should be kept to make
future inspections easier.

           E4.3.3.2.4. Inspect incoming mail at least once a week and report deficiencies to the mailing
activity OMM.

             E4.3.3.2.5. Inspect outgoing mail at least once a week at the final preparation point to:

              E4.3.3.2.5.1. Determine where additional training is needed and which policies and
procedures need additional emphasis.

                E4.3.3.2.5.2. Make sure the mail is prepared properly. Items containing errors or
deficiencies in preparation shall be returned for correction.

                E4.3.3.2.5.3. Detect unauthorized use of postage.

               E4.3.3.2.5.4. Make sure consolidated mailings are properly prepared and contain only

           E4.3.3.2.13. (Added)(AF) Large volume mailers using Intra/Inter-Theater Delivery
Service (IDS)/Military Postal Service (MPS) must coordinate with the OMM prior to creating one-
time large volume mailings and all recurring mailings being sent from the activity. The OMM will
ensure cost reduction guidance in DOD 4525.8-M_AFMAN 33-306 is thoroughly reviewed by

according to General Services Administration (GSA) and DoD requirements. (Ref E4.3.6 and
E4.4)

     E4.3.4. OMP Inspections

        E4.3.4.1. Service Components and Agency OMMs will ensure written notification is provided to
the DoD OMM that corrective actions have been taken on installations receiving an unsatisfactory rating
during a Military Postal Service Agency Program Management Inspection. Interim reports will be
provided until all corrective actions have been taken. The DoD OMM may perform a follow-up
inspection on those installations to ensure all corrective actions have been accomplished.

        E4.3.4.2. Component headquarters, major commands (MACOMs), and intermediate commands
shall conduct internal headquarters OMM inspections at least once a year. Component headquarters,
MACOMs, and intermediate commands shall ensure scheduled inspections of subordinate installations
and activities include the DoD OMP. These scheduled inspections may be part of the IG DoD
inspections.

       E4.3.4.3. Installation or equivalent OMMs shall inspect all of the installation's staff activities,
subordinate activities and tenant activities on the installation annually on a calendar year basis. These

                                                                                           ENCLOSURE 5
19                                                           DODI4525.08_AFI33-365, 31 MAY 2011

inspection reports shall be filed and made available for review during MACOM and IG DoD inspections
and staff assistance visits.

        E4.3.4.3. (Added)(AF) Installation OMMs will inspect ADOs annually using locally
devised checklists approved by their MAJCOM OMMs. Normally, inspections are carried out by
the OMC manager who may be a contractor. However, Installation OMMs are still responsible
for inspection program oversight and shall validate each inspection report. Commands may wish
to include this requirement when drafting SOWs.

        E4.3.4.4. DD Form 2495 (Official Mail Manager's Inspection Checklist) may be used for
inspections. Local reproduction of this form is authorized. (See Enclosure 5.)

    E4.3.5. OMP Surveys and Tests. Surveys and tests may be required periodically to determine the
transit time and the volume of internal mail and official mail, by class and special postal service, being
entered into the USPS. When surveys are directed, the originator provides instructions. Publishing the
results of these surveys builds customer confidence in the internal mail delivery system, helps control
requests for overnight service, and makes it easier to make a case for using lower cost alternatives.
These surveys and tests can also alert managers to possible problems with addressing, messenger
routing, pick up, print readability, and other issues.

    E4.3.6. OMP Information Requirements. DoD Components using prepaid postage shall report such
purchases. Report Control Symbol (RCS) DD-AT&L(SA)1833, Prepaid Postage Report, has been
assigned to this information requirement according to Reference (g). Each Component's summary
report shall be received by the DoD Official Mail Manager, Military Postal Service Agency, 2461
Eisenhower Avenue, STE 812, Alexandria, VA 22331-0006 no later than 30 November and 31 May of
each year and shall cover purchases for the preceding two fiscal quarters. Purchases shall be reported
using the following 13 mail codes. Overseas activities using host country postage shall include such
purchases under the appropriate mail code. All mail codes shall be reported in numerical sequence
semi-annually (Show a zero where applicable). (NOTE: Deposits to trust accounts (TA) or similar
accounts are NOT purchases; the purchases take place as USPS deducts funds from these accounts for
services rendered.) Each Component shall verify the existence of mail security plans within their
agency. This verification shall indicate that these plans have been prepared in accordance with DoD,
practiced quarterly, reviewed annually, and coordinated with local emergency responders.

   E4.3.6. (Added)(AF) Official mail expenditures are reported during the months of October
and April each year via the Air Force Automated Prepaid Postage Report System.

        E4.3.6.1. Mail Code 1001 Address Correction. Charges for address correction must be paid
either by cash or deduction from a Postage Due Trust Account or (where available) a Centralized
Account Processing System (CAPS) account. Report under Mail Code 1001 only if payment is made by
cash or by an identifiable transaction in a CAPS account.

       E4.3.6.2. Mail Code 1002 Business Reply Mail (BRM). Charges for BRM may be paid by cash,
deduction from a postage due account, or a local TA or a CAPS account. Do not report under Code
1002 payments made by deduction from a postage due account.
       E4.3.6.3. Mail Code 1003 Express Mail. Postage for Express Mail may be paid by cash, postage
stamps, postage meter imprint, credit card, or Express Mail Corporate Account or (where available) a

                                                                                          ENCLOSURE 5

CAPS account. Report under this mail code only postage paid by cash or by deduction from an Express
Mail Corporate Account. Do not include postage paid by postage meter imprint or postage stamps.

       E4.3.6.4. Mail Code 1004 Return Service. This service must be paid for by deductions from a
TA or (where available) a CAPS account.

        E4.3.6.5. Mail Code 1005 Meter Settings. Payment for postage meter settings (purchases) may
be made via cash, check, or deduction from a TA. In all cases, report the purchases under Code 1005.
Amounts set on meters resulting from refunds for spoiled meter postage are not purchases. Do not

E4.4. (Added)(AF) AIR FORCE AUTOMATED PREPAID POSTAGE REPORTING SYSTEM

    E4.4.1. (Added)(AF) All Air Force units are responsible to report prepaid official postage to
their MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU through the Automated Prepaid Postage Reporting System.

     E4.4.2. (Added)(AF) Reporting Guidelines:

        E4.4.2.1. (Added)(AF) MAJCOMs, FOAs, or DRUs establish deadlines for their reporting
units to complete their report. MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU reports will be completed, reviewed, and
submitted no later than 25 November and 25 April each year to allow the Air Force to meet DOD
reporting requirements.

           E4.4.2.1.1. (Added)(AF) Units will contact their MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU OMMs for
login, passwords, and other reporting information questions and requirements

      E4.4.2.2. (Added)(AF) Units shall ensure report is correct and inputs saved properly.
Contact the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU OMM if problems occur.

       E4.4.2.3. (Added)(AF) Installation OMMs provide MAJCOM OMM explanations of any
variance of 20% or more in any mail code from the previous report.

       E4.4.2.4. (Added)(AF) Units will only report actual postage expenditures during the
period. Do not report the amount simply loaded onto the meter. Report expenditures as they are
spent.

        E4.4.2.5. (Added)(AF) MAJCOM OMMs advise AF OMM of reporting problems or
significant increases or decreases in any mail code.

       E4.4.2.6. (Added)(AF) All Air Force official mail centers are required to maintain mail
center security plans per paragraph E4.3.6.. Forward a copy of approved security plan to your
MAJCOM OMM. Upon annual review, provide an updated copy. MAJCOM OMMs will
                                                                                          ENCLOSURE 5

maintain current copies of all subordinate locations’ security plans. MAJCOM OMMs shall
review plans and develop templates for subordinate OMC use.

           E4.4.2.6.1. (Added)(AF) When submitting semiannual prepaid postage report,
locations will be asked to select yes/no from a dropdown box in response to the following mail
center security plans certification statement “I certify this unit has a mail security plan according to
DoD and GSA guidance, that the plan is practiced quarterly, reviewed annually, and coordinated with
local emergency providers and first responders.” Selection of “no” is unacceptable.

E4.5. (Added)(AF) OMC AND TMO SHIPPING MAILING RESPONSIBILITY

     E4.5.1. (Added)(AF) General Information

       E4.5.1.1. (Added)(AF) Air Force Activities must use the most cost efficient mode legally
available that will deliver material to its destination.

       E4.5.1.2. (Added)(AF) The OMC (a function of the Air Force/Army post office (APO)
overseas) acts as the installation’s primary expert for official mail and provides all necessary
interface with ADOs, DoD, and USPS. OMMs will ensure all First-Class official matter is moved
by USPS according to Private Express Statutes (39 U.S.C. and 39 CFR).

      E4.5.1.3. (Added)(AF) The TMO is normally the installation’s focal point for all non-
USPS methods for moving official matter and is responsible for establishing accounts, shipping
matter, and interface with private carriers, except as noted in E4.5.2.2.

       E4.5.1.4. (Added)(AF) The OMM and TMO will coordinate to ensure each organization
uses the most cost effective method to move official matter, within legal and policy requirements.

     E4.5.2. (Added)(AF) Responsibilities

       E4.5.2.1. (Added)(AF) The OMM is responsible for processes and funding associated with
movement of all official mail through USPS entering the system at their location, regardless of the
item’s origin. USPS will be used for all mailings required to be posted at the First Class rate due
to PES requirements.

        E4.5.2.2. (Added)(AF) The TMO is normally responsible for the processes and funding
associated with small package carriers (SPC) that transport all non-First-Class official mail
matter from the installation. The installation OMM shall assist the TMO in ensuring the PES is
not violated. On installations where the Installation Commander has decided that it is more
economical for the OMC to handle SPC shipments, then the Installation OMM will record the
shipping costs and include costs when submitting the installation’s semi-annual prepaid postage
report.

     E4.5.3. (Added)(AF) First-Class Material in Private Carrier Shipments

       E4.5.3.1. (Added)(AF) The USPS has a general monopoly for the transmission of First-
Class material. Therefore, if First-Class material is sent with a private delivery company, the
proper amount of First-Class postage must be placed on the material. This is in addition to those

                                                                                       ENCLOSURE 5

charges from a private delivery company. Air Force activities shall not send First-Class material
by private delivery companies unless there is no alternative. There are two major exceptions to
this restriction:

       E4.5.3.2. (Added)(AF) Invoices, bills, and similar First-Class material sent with, and
exclusively for, the cargo they accompany do not require additional First-Class postage.

      E4.5.3.3. (Added)(AF) If there is a disruption of the USPS, private delivery companies
may transport First-Class material without payment of postage.

E4.6. (Added)(AF) Management of Air Force Explosive Residue Detection Systems

    E4.6.1. (Added)(AF) SAF/A6 currently provides warranty coverage and inventory for all
APO and OMC IONSCAN 400B and SABRE 2000/4000 explosive trace detection machines.
There are very specific requirements for maintaining these machines. For detailed management
instructions and training, go to the IONSCAN Folder on the Air Force Postal Policy Community
of Practice at: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/AirForcePostal

      E4.6.1.1. (Added)(AF) Machines must be leak tested immediately upon arrival and every
six months thereafter. Maintain the most recent test results with your machine maintenance log.

        *E4.6.1.2. (Added)(AF) Machines are no longer required to be registered with AF Medical
Services Agency (AFMSA). However, current guidance is under review and AFMSA may
reinstitute registration requirements. AF A3CX/A6CX will notify MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs
of any guidance changes and provide registration procedures if requirements change.

       E4.6.1.3. (Added)(AF) Machines may not be transferred to a new location or sent in for
repair unless coordinated with your MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU OMM. Note, AFI 40-201,
Managing Radioactive Materials in the U.S. Air Force, requires machines be leak tested before
shipment.

    E4.6.1.4. (Added)(AF) Never dispose of an IONSCAN or SABRE locally. Contact the AF
OMM for disposition instructions.

*E4.7. (Added)(AF) Use of AF Form 624, Base/Unit Locator and PSC Directory. Postal Service
Centers may use AF Form 624, Base/Unit Locator and PSC Directory, to capture pertinent
customer details.

                         ALTERNATIVE OPERATING PROCEDURES


(Added)(AF) This enclosure recommends procedures that can be implemented to enhance
morale, reduce government expenditures, or help maintain USPS post office operations on your
installation. These procedures (with the exception of paragraphs E7.1.1.3., E7.1.2.1., E7.1.2.2.,
and E7.2.4.) are not required to be implemented. They are suggestions and best practices
collected from across the Air Force.

E7. (Added)(AF) ALTERNATIVE OPERATING PROCEDURES

     E7.1. (Added)(AF) Official Mail Center (OMC)

        E7.1.1. (Added)(AF) Elimination of Postage Meter.

            E7.1.1.1. (Added)(AF) If the cost of maintaining a postage meter and mailing machine
(meter base) is more than the installation’s annual expenditure on postage, consider using postage
stamps on official letters and mailing official parcels through your installation post office. This
will save the cost of leasing a postage meter, the cost of purchasing a mailing machine, and its
annual maintenance contract cost. The OMC should use a government purchase card to pay for
stamps and parcel mailing. These extra revenues may be enough to help keep your installation
USPS post office solvent. Coordination with your installation USPS postmaster is required.

NOTE: DoD installations have lost their base post offices due to ever decreasing business. Taking
creative steps where possible to ensure the viability of your installation’s post office will benefit
the entire community.

           E7.1.1.2. (Added)(AF) PC Postage. Use of PC Postage will not benefit your installation
post office; however it will allow installations to recognize a savings by not paying for a postage
meter, mailing machine, and associated maintenance contract. PC Postage is downloaded to a
computer and postage is printed usually using a Dymo type printer. PC Postage is normally only
used to print postage for parcel mail due to costs involved in purchasing specialized printer labels.
Purchase postage stamps for letter mail. Additionally, you will need to purchase a parcel scale to
use PC Postage.

            E7.1.1.3. (Added)(AF) Regardless of how postage is applied, the OMC is still
responsible for consolidating mailings and reporting official postage expenditures per Enclosure 4
of this Instruction.

        E7.1.2. (Added)(AF) Cost Cutting Measures

           E7.1.2.1. (Added)(AF) Require ADOs to justify use of Certified Mail. Delivery
Confirmation provides the same service as Certified Mail. Except when Certified Mail is required
by law or the mail item is less than 3.5 ounces, Delivery Confirmation shall be used when a
tracking number is requested. Note: electronic delivery confirmation is free. Consult your meter
vendor for procedures and training.

                                                                                     ENCLOSURE 7
29                                                       DODI4525.08_AFI33-365, 31 MAY 2011


          E7.1.2.2. (Added)(AF) Discourage use of PS Form 3811, Return Receipt. Only when
Certified Mail is required by law or instruction shall return receipts be used. Otherwise, OPRs
can view and print delivery information at USPS.com. Considering the rate of non-return of PS
Form 3811, it is difficult to justify their continued use and expense.


     E7.2. (Added)(AF) Mailing Kiosks/Personal Mail Stations

       E7.2.1. (Added)(AF) If the USPS post office on your installation has closed or if the use of
the post office in not convenient, consider adding a personal mail station to your PSC, OMC, or
other location.

       E7.2.2. (Added)(AF) Mailing kiosks similar to those found in US Post Offices are available
on the GSA schedule. In 2009, the monthly lease cost was approximately $800 per month.
However, a much less expensive option is available using a computer and printer, and supplying
specialized address labels purchased from USPS. The computer will need internet capability to
reach USPS.com. Once on the USPS website, the user should select Click & Ship, and follow the
prompts to compute postage and print a mailing label. The website will accept user’s credit or
debit card. The user can then hand over their parcel to the PSC or OMC manager, who will in
turn hand it over to USPS. For a small investment and low operating cost, the communications
squadron can provide personal mail service to their installation.

       E7.2.3. (Added)(AF) Mailing kiosks or Click and Ship mailing stations can be used to
print postage for official parcels utilizing a government purchase card.

       E7.2.4. (Added)(AF) Regardless of the means chosen to apply official postage (meter, PC
postage, stamps, or kiosk), do not allow individual units to mail their official mail separately.
OMCs shall still consolidate mailings wherever possible.
