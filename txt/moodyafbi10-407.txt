PURPOSE: To outline procedures for wing schedulers and command post (CP) controllers on how to
schedule Moody MOAs and R-3008.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document has been significantly revised and must be completely reviewed.

1. Requests/changes to the flying schedule for Moody and transient units for MOA 1 when not utilized by
AETC (Hog, Rodan, Viper, Texan, Diamond), Moody 2, Moody 3, Live Oak, and R-3008 will be done
IAW the following procedures:
   1.1. Same day requests are made to the command post. If the request falls within the 479 FTG/347
   RQW flying window, CP will approve the request, based on the daily airspace schedule, and call
   RAPCON to advise them of the changes.
       1.1.1. If the request falls outside of the 479 FTG/347 RQW flying window, CP will call RAPCON
       Watch Supervisor to inquire if RAPCON has the appropriate manning to accommodate MOA/
       range activation. If RAPCON can support the request, they will notify CP who will in turn grant
       approval to the request. If RAPCON does not have the required manning, they will advise CP, who
       will disapprove the request.
NOTE: RAPCON manning is scheduled on a "floater" basis to accommodate Moody assigned flying and
maximize controller training capability. Same day requests may be disapproved outside of the wing flying
window because manning was already scheduled to cover wing flying.
   1.2. Day prior requests, CP receives, prior to 1600L, they will direct the requesting agency to Wing
   Scheduling (OSOS). After 1600L, calls are referred to CP and paragraph 1.1. is applicable.
       1.2.1. If the request falls within the 479 FTG/347 RQW flying window, wing schedulers will
       approve the request (based on airspace availability). There is no need to call RAPCON since the
2                                                         MOODYAFBI10-407 19 OCTOBER 2003


       MOA/range schedule will be provided to RAPCON daily and any additions outside of "same day"
       will already be on that schedule.
       1.2.2. If the request falls outside of the 479 FTG/347 RQW flying window for transient or Moody
       aircraft, wing schedulers will contact RAPCON Chief Controller, ext. 3797, up until 1200L the
       day prior, to inquire if RAPCON can support the request. If RAPCON can support, wing schedul-
       ers will add the mission to the MOA/range schedule. If RAPCON cannot support due to manning,
       wing schedulers will deny the request. After 1200L, they will follow guidance in paragraph
       1.2.1.above.
    1.3. Requests made inside two weeks but before the day prior, for Moody aircraft, if MOA/range time
    changes are required and they fall inside the scheduled 479 FTG/347 RQW flying window, normal
    scheduling through the Wing Scheduling office is required. If alterations to the Wing flying window
    are required and they subsequently affect MOA/range times, the flying window change must first be
    coordinated /approved on a AF Form 2407, using MAFB Form 2407 coordination sheet as a guide-
    line. Moody currently has AF FORM 2407 routing procedures in ACCI 21-101, Sup 5. Contact the
    Wing Scheduling office for MOA/range changes. 1.3.2. For transient units, refer to paragraph 1.2.
    above
    1.4. Requests made greater than two weeks out, Moody unit requests will be approved.
       1.4.1. Transients will not be scheduled more than two weeks out unless a special request or task-
       ing occurs and is coordinated through the OG/CC.
    1.5. Weekend Requests, all Moody MOAs are closed Saturday and reopen Sunday.
       1.5.1. The MOAs can be activated on a limited basis. RAPCON is not normally manned for week-
       end MOA operations.
       1.5.2. Moody aircraft must request Sunday operations by 1630L on the Thursday prior to the
       requested date through Wing Scheduling. Wing Scheduling will contact RAPCON Chief Control-
       ler, ext. 3797, to coordinate. RAPCON Chief Controller will evaluate manning to determine if he
       can support Sunday operations. If they can, wing schedulers will pass approval to the requesting
       unit and then contact Base Operations to publish a NOTAM for MOA operations. If RAPCON
       cannot support Sunday operations, wing schedulers will notify the requesting agency.
       1.5.3. Weekend MOA operations are not authorized for transient aircraft and wing schedulers will
       disapprove all transient requests.
