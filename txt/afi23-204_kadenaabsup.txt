                     SAMPLE INSPECTION GUIDANCE (ITEM NO.)

A4.1. Tank(s): Check exterior for corrosion, settling, damage and warping. Check tank vents
for freedom of obstruction and condition of rain cap. Check condition of ladders, visual
inspection only for proper alignment, rust formations, etc. CONVAULT style, cement tanks
must be free of cracks on top and sides so rain water does not enter.
A4.2. Grounding Hardware: Tank must be grounded to earth ground point by a ground wire
or metal strap. Visually inspect for security of wiring and ensure it is free of corrosion on
attachment points.
A4.3. Pumps and Motors: Check for unusual noise or vibration during operation. Check for
overheating during operation. Clean regularly at and below connections. Look for fuel residue
accumulation on surfaces below connections and fittings.
A4.4. Leaks: All fuel leaks will be promptly reported to 18 CES Fire and Emergency Services
at 911 or by cell phone at 098-934-5911 and to 718 CES Asset Management Flight,
Environmental Office (718 CES/CEAN), 634-2600. Any fuel leak is a safety and environmental
hazard and will be cause to place the system out of service until the problem is corrected.
A4.5. Piping: Inspect all piping for leaks, corrosion and damage. If piping is underground,
visually inspect the path and look for dead vegetation, this is a sign of a leaking underground fuel
pipe.
A4.6. Valves: Ensure handles are available, valves operate freely, easily, and lubricate as
required. Ensure receipt lines and low-points are locked/secured to prevent theft and
contamination.
A4.7. Meters: Observe for proper operation. Whenever performance is suspected, the meter
will be calibrated by 18th CES Water Fuel Systems Maintenance. Ensure meters are properly
sealed, not overdue calibration, and labeled with calibration data.
A4.8. System Area: Ensure area is free from safety, fire and explosive hazards. Ensure
drainage system is secure and unobstructed. Ensure lights are operational. Check fences for
condition and ensure locking system is in use.
A4.9. Signs/Markings
A4.9.1. Aboveground Storage Tanks: Organizational tanks should have a white sign larger
than 0.3 meters wide and 0.6 meters long (approx. 12 in by 24 in), or clearly visible from 16
meters (approx. 50 ft). The sign should contain (Figure A4.1), the following information in black
letters, in both English and Japanese: tank identification number; maximum storage capacity; the
name, title, and telephone number of the current point of contact; and in red letters "DANGER:
NO FLAMMABLE OR IGNITION SOURCES WITHIN 50 FEET OR 16 METERS."
A4.9.2. Underground Storage Tanks: The fill pipe should have a white sign larger than 0.3
meters wide and 0.6 meters long (approx. 12 in by 24 in), or clearly visible from 16 meters
(approx. 50 ft). The sign should contain (Figure A4.1), the following information in black letters,
in both English and Japanese: "Fill pipe for an Underground Storage Tank", maximum storage
capacity, the name, title, and telephone number of the current point of contact; and in red letters
 6                                              AFI23-204_KADENAABSUP 30 MAY 2013


“DANGER: NO FLAMMABLE OR IGNITION SOURCES WITHIN 50 FEET OR 16
METERS".
A4.10. Dikes: Check for deterioration. Ensure exterior dike drain valves are locked in the
closed position. Drain any rain water accumulation after first determining there is no fuel
residue present.
A4.11. Leak Indicator: On CONVAULT style, cement tanks, check the leak indicator on top,
if the red float is up indicating a leak, contact CE immediately to remove water/fuel/both from
interstitial space (secondary containment).
