                                          Chapter 1

                               GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General.
   1.1.1. The 25th Operational Weather Squadron (25 OWS) and 27th Special Operations
   Support Squadron Weather Flight (27 SOSS/OSW or Weather Flight), are the official
   weather information agencies for the 27 SOW. Basic concepts and procedures are outlined
   in Air Force and Air Force Special Operations Command directives. Additional information
   and details of support provided by the 25 OWS are provided in a Memorandum of
   Agreement between the Weather Flight and the 25 OWS.
   1.1.2. This instruction establishes requirements and procedures for weather support which
   must be coordinated at the local level to meet mission needs. It consolidates weather support
   requirements and procedures for peacetime operations and stands as the written agreement
   between the weather unit and supported operations. It does not cover weather support
   procedures for emergency war operations or certain other special operations or procedures.
   These are covered in applicable plans/regulations.
   1.1.3. Classification. This document is UNCLASSIFIED and does not fall within the scope
   of directives governing the protection of information affecting national security. This
   document is FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY in accordance with AFI 37-132.
   1.1.4. OPSEC. Operational security has been considered in the update process of this
   document. The nature of operational support identified does not violate OPSEC.
   1.1.5. Documentation. Weather Flight leadership will ensure that information on weather
   services are documented in respective host/parent unit operations plans, contingency plans,
   memorandum(s) of understanding, host-tenant support agreements, full spectrum threat
   response plan(s), airfield local operating procedures (as described in AFI 13-204), or the
   weather support plan. Weather annexes and plans will be reviewed and revised consistent
   with host/parent unit procedures. Weather Flight leadership will initiate an out-of-cycle
   formal review to accurately reflect operational changes resulting from host/parent unit
   mission changes, equipment upgrades, or significant changes in overarching guidance.
1.2. Designators. All weather products disseminated by or for Cannon AFB (CAFB) will use
KCVS as the ICAO location indicator. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) index
number is 722686. All weather products disseminated by or for Melrose Range will use K4MR
as the ICAO location indicator. The Melrose Range Control Forecast will use the product
identifier, FOUS01 KAOS.
1.3. Weather Operations.
   1.3.1. Operational Weather Squadrons (OWSs) provide resource protection, Terminal
   Aerodrome Forecasts (TAFs), regional and operational-level weather products and
   information, meteorological watch (METWATCH), Pilot-to-Metro Service (PMSV), and
   limited flight weather Mission Execution Forecast (MEF) support for Air Force and Army
   locations within designated geographic regions.
 6                                                CANNONAFBI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2012


     1.3.2. The 25 OWS at Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ provides regional and operational-level
     weather products and information to Air Force and Army units operating in the southwest
     Conterminous United States (CONUS). In addition, the 25 OWS will provide weather
     warnings, watches and advisories (WWAs) and a range control forecast to Melrose Range.
     The Weather Flight will focus on producing a MEF which includes tactical-level weather
     products and information needed for mission execution. Weather Flight will also provide
     weather products and information to the commander of deployed forces during wartime,
     contingency and exercise operations.
     1.3.3. The Weather Flight Commander is the designated Staff Weather Officer (SWO) to the
     27 SOW and will coordinate all weather support required by permanent and temporary units
     assigned to CAFB. In the Weather Flight Commander‘s absence, the Deputy Weather Flight
     Commander will assume staff SWO duties and responsibilities.
1.4. Shortfalls and Limiting Factors.
     1.4.1. When the airfield is open, a weather technician will be present. A scheduled weather
     technician will be on standby status when the airfield is either closed or in standby status.
     When the airfield is required to reopen on short notice, the weather technician is notified
     through Installation Command Center via weather‘s standby phone number (575-693-2522).
     When the airfield opens and there are immediate scheduled flying sorties, a weather
     technician will arrive in time to prepare and post a Mission Execution Forecast (MEF) 3 hrs
     prior to the earliest scheduled mission takeoff time.
     1.4.2. The official surface observation site is located 50 feet from the southeast side of the
     Base Weather Station (BWS) building 135. From this site, buildings restrict the field of view
     from the SSW clockwise to the NNE. View restrictions include the Runway 13 approach
     zone, making ceiling, visibility, and weather determinations in that quadrant more difficult.
     For a complete horizontal picture, the weather technician will walk around building 135 to
     gain a more complete picture, however the gathering of all other sensed data will be from the
     official point of observation. Weather technicians will use air traffic controller input to help
     post a fully representative observation during manual observing situations.
     1.4.3. During night observations, high intensity ramp lights make detection of visibility and
     low cloud layers difficult to determine from the NNE clockwise to the SSW.
     1.4.4. The FMQ-19 Automatic Weather Station provides the official observation for CAFB.
     The FMQ-19 operates in automatic mode except during periods of inclement weather or
     during a partial and/or full system failure. During periods of inclement weather, the weather
     technician will perform supplementation of the FMQ-19 when specified weather conditions
     exist per AFMAN 15-111. The FMQ-19 has wind information on runways 04, 22 and 31.
     There is no available wind information for runway 13. When runway 13 is in use, wind
     information is used from runway 04 since the 04 end weather data is closest to the runway 13
     end.
     1.4.5. Melrose Range weather conditions are verified on a limited basis. On Melrose Range,
     there is a fire weather sensor suite and a fixed based version of the TMQ-53 (TMOS-P). A
     Fixed Meteorological Automatic Weather Station (FMQ-22) is scheduled to be installed in
     December 2011. The fire weather sensor system sends out a limited weather observation
     once per hour and does not include ceiling and visibility data. Current verification of
CANNONAFBI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                               7


   Melrose Range current weather conditions depends upon communication between Melrose
   tower personnel, the Weather Flight, and the once-per-hr weather report from the fire
   weather sensor. When the FMQ-22 is declared fully operational, this system will be used for
   verification of Melrose Range weather conditions.
1.5. Duty Priorities. All BWS tasks cannot be accomplished simultaneously. Therefore, duty
priorities are established to ensure tasks are accomplished in order of mission-essential
importance and publicized to avoid misunderstanding among supported agencies. Duty priorities
will ensure timely response to situations under normal conditions. However, the list will not
replace good judgment. The weather technician may deviate in the best interest of flight safety
and/or protection of personnel or property. The weather technician will use the attached Duty
Priority List as guidance for deciding which duties have priority during task saturation conditions
(Attachment 2).
1.6. Geographic Area of Responsibility. The area of responsibility for products and services
provided by the BWS is the terminal area, which is the area located within a 5 nautical mile
(NM) radius around the center runway of the CAFB airfield complex.
1.7. Operating Hours.
   1.7.1. Staff services are available from 0730L to 1630L, Monday through Friday, except
   federal holidays, Wing Goal Days, and MAJCOM-directed Safety Down Days. A schedule
   of known off-days will be provided to the 25 OWS when available but may not be all
   inclusive.
   1.7.2. The Airfield Services and Mission Element technicians will be available 24/7. The
   two positions will usually be combined during periods of slow air operations such as during
   the mid-shift hours. This allows one weather technician to typically work the mid-shift.
   1.7.3. The 25 OWS will handle all MEF, 175-1, FM-87 and/or verbal brief requests when
   the Weather Flight is closed.
       1.7.3.1. The 25 OWS briefing support may be requested by phone, fax or website.

1.9. Weather Flight Evacuation. When the Weather Flight is required to evacuate, it will
relocate to the alternate operating location (AOL) located on the ninth floor of the control tower
(building 128). The tertiary site is the 27 SOSS/IN work center (building 12). Weather services
will continue as normal as long as access to the Joint Environmental Toolkit (JET) server is
available. If unable to connect, observations will be relayed in whatever manner possible
(phone, e-mail, etc). If both the alternate and tertiary operating sites are unsuitable for use, the
Weather Flight will relocate to the nearest facility with phone and electricity. If further
constraints occur that prevents this posture, the Weather Flight will adopt tactical weather
operations using tactical weather equipment.
     1.9.1. The 25 OWS will assume the following duties until the Weather Flight resumes
     operations:
     1.9.2. Perform METWATCH and MISSIONWATCH for 27 SOW operations and issue all
     terminal and flying area weather watches, warnings, and advisories to the best of their ability.
     Since the 25 OWS is limited to cloud-to-ground strike data from the National Lightning
     Detection Network, it does not have the capability to detect or observe other lightning strike
     occurrences such as cloud-to-cloud or cloud-to-air lightning. Therefore, the sound of thunder
     can occur without a corresponding lightning strike being detected and confirmed on the
     lightning detection system(s).
     1.9.3. The 25 OWS will assume responsibility for all other flight weather MEFs for missions
     departing CAFB and conduct limited MISSIONWATCH for these flights. This responsibility
     is spelled out in the CAFB Installation Data Page with the 25 OWS.
1.10. Dissemination Capability.
     1.10.1. The JET is the primary means for disseminating surface observations, TAFs, WWAs
     and PIREPs. JET products are available online at https://jetkcvs.cannon.af.mil/ and may
     be viewed through the Airfield Automation System (AFAS). Work centers which require
     weather situational awareness need to contact the Weather Flight and have the JET
     administrator establish a JET account.
1.11. Release of Weather Information. Release of weather information to non-DoD agencies,
off-base news agencies and the general public must be approved by the 27 SOW Public Affairs
office.

                             AIRFIELD SERVICES ELEMENT

2.1. Weather Observations.
   2.1.1. Automated Observations. The Weather Flight uses the FMQ-19 Automated
   Meteorological Station as its primary surface weather observation source. The FMQ-19 is a
   sophisticated set of weather instruments that measure pressure, precipitation, wind speed,
   wind direction, visibility, runway visual range, sky cover, cloud height, temperature, dew
   point and lightning. The FMQ-19 has 3 different operational modes: Normal, Augmented,
   and Backup.
       2.1.1.1. Normal Mode: When the FMQ-19 is in Normal Operational Mode, the system
       automatically records, encodes and disseminates weather observations without human
       intervention.
       2.1.1.2. Supplement Mode: The FMQ-19 will be placed in Augmented Operational
       Mode during the following conditions:
           2.1.1.2.1. Tornadic activity.
           2.1.1.2.2. Hail ¾ inch or greater.
           2.1.1.2.3. Any weather condition that is considered operationally significant (e.g. has
           a significant mission impact or mission failure).
       2.1.1.3. Backup Mode: The FMQ-19 will be placed in Backup Operational Mode when
       there is a partial system failure, or a visual assessment determines that specific sensors do
       not accurately reflect actual weather conditions. When the FMQ-19 is in Backup
       Operational Mode, the system will record, encode, and disseminate weather observations
       including human editing of data that is unavailable (e.g. due to a broken sensor) or
       unrepresentative and operationally significant. When the FMQ-19 detects something
       wrong with itself, (i.e. PNO – Precipitation sensor Not Operative) the weather technician
       will use backup mode observation procedures.
       2.1.1.4. Limitations: FMQ-19 has limitations in its ability to determine prevailing
       visibility, cloud cover and ceilings. Since the FMQ-19 only samples cloud data directly
       above the sensor, there is no accurate way to determine cloud cover of the entire visible
       sky. The visibility sensor samples a small part of the air in the vicinity of the sensor to
       determine visibility. The FMQ-19 will not be able to do the whole horizon concept and
       detect reduced visibilities in specific sectors of the airfield.
2.2. Manual Observations. The Weather Flight will manually observe weather observation
elements when all or part of the FMQ-19 is not operational. The location of the weather
observing site does not permit a 360degree unrestricted view of the weather and is further limited
by the lack of visibility markers beyond 4 statute miles. Visibilities at night are limited due to
the lack of distinguishable nighttime visibility references.
2.3. Dissemination. Automated Observations are taken by the FMQ-19 Automated Weather
Observing System, and disseminated locally and long-line via the Joint Environmental Toolkit
(JET) system and are identified by the heading "KCVS, (type of observation), and time (UTC)."
 10                                              CANNONAFBI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2012


During periods when the FMQ-19 or JET system is inoperative, observations will be relayed via
telephone and/or hotlines to the 27 SOW/CP and ATC agencies. When received by
telephone/hotline, these agencies will provide the caller with their initials and a read-back of the
entire observation to ensure accurate reception of the information.
2.4. Basic Weather Watch (BWW). A Basic Weather Watch will be used when the FMQ-19 is
in Supplement or Backup mode (see 2.1.1.2. and 2.1.1.3 above). Weather personnel normally
conduct a BWW from the BWS. Due to other duties, along with other restrictions such as a
BWS design that does not allow a 360-degree view of the runway complex, etc., weather
personnel cannot continuously monitor the weather nor detect and report all weather changes as
they occur. In addition to taking and disseminating required observations, the BWW observing
program includes minimum requirements to recheck weather conditions at intervals not to
exceed 20 minutes since the last observation/recheck, to determine the need for a LOCAL or
SPECI observation, when any of the following conditions are observed to be occurring or are
forecast to occur within one hour:
   2.4.1. Ceiling forms below or decreases to less than 1,500 feet.
   2.4.2. Ceiling dissipates, or increases to equal or exceed 1,500 feet.
   2.4.3. Visibility 3 statute miles or less.
   2.4.4. Precipitation (any form).
   2.4.5. Fog or Mist.
   2.4.6. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather personnel will remain alert
   for any other changes in weather conditions that will require a SPECI.
   2.4.7. When a reliable source (ATC personnel, pilots, law enforcement, etc.) reports weather
   conditions different from the last report, weather personnel will recheck the weather and, if
   required, disseminate a new observation.
2.5. Supplemented Observations. The Weather Flight will supplement weather observation
elements when all or part of the FMQ-19 is not operational or observation elements are not
deemed representative of airfield conditions.
   2.5.1. SPECI. A non-routine weather observation taken whenever specific weather
   thresholds are observed (criteria follows below): Take, disseminate and record a SPECI
   when:
       2.5.1.1. Ceiling – the ceiling forms below, decreases to less than, or if below, increase to
       equal or exceed the following threshold values in Table 2.1, Column One:

NOTE: The locally established criteria of 2500 ft and 2000 ft are to alert the watch supervisor
as to when they can open or close the overhead pattern for landing at CAFB. The 2000 ft
threshold is required so that the watch supervisor has the option to lower the overhead pattern to
1500 ft. The 2500‘ and 2000‘ CIG values are SPECI criteria so off-station aircraft have this
information prior to landing at CAFB.
       2.5.1.2. Sky Conditions – a layer of clouds or obscuring phenomena aloft is present or
       forms at or below 700 ft (highest published landing min in FLIP), and no layer was
       reported below that level in the preceding METAR or SPECI.
       2.5.1.3. Prevailing Visibility - the prevailing visibility decreases to less than, or if below
       increases to equal or exceed the threshold values in Table 2.2, Column One:

       2.5.1.4. Tornado or Funnel Cloud - a tornado or funnel cloud is observed or disappears
       from sight or when a tornado or funnel cloud occurred within the past hour according to
       an outside source and was not observed or recorded at the station.
       2.5.1.5. Thunderstorms – a thunderstorm begins or ends (15 min after last heard). A
       SPECI is not required to report the beginning of a new thunderstorm if one is currently
       reported as in progress at the station.
       2.5.1.6. Precipitation- precipitation begins or ends (any form). Additionally, record a
       SPECI whenever the intensity of freezing precipitation, hail and/or ice pellets changes.
       2.5.1.7. Squall and Wind Shift - when the wind speed suddenly increases at least 16 kts
       and is sustained at 22 kts or more for at least one minute indicating a squall has occurred.
       Furthermore, if the wind direction changes 45 degrees or more in less than 15 min and
 12                                              CANNONAFBI15-101 11 SEPTEMBER 2012


       when the wind speed throughout the wind shift is sustained or is gusting at 10 kts or
       more, take a SPECI to identify a wind shift.
       2.5.1.8. In addition to the above minimum requirements, weather personnel will remain
       alert for any other changes in weather conditions that are deemed potentially hazardous to
       the safety of any aircraft. When potentially hazardous weather conditions occur a SPECI
       observation will be issued.
   2.5.2. Other Meteorological Situations. A SPECI or METAR will be issued for any
   meteorological situation which is significantly different than currently reported conditions
   and adversely affects local operations. If a SPECI or METAR is necessary because of
   rapidly deteriorating conditions, the remark ―Rapidly Deteriorating Weather Conditions‖ will
   be appended to the observation in Column 13, Local Remarks (Local Policy).
   2.5.3. Weather personnel will remain alert for any other changes in weather conditions that
   are deemed potentially hazardous to the safety of the aircraft, facilities or personnel. When
   noted, a SPECI observation will be issued to cover unusual conditions outside the standard
   observation criteria yet is significant to local flying operations (i.e. smoke over approach end
   of runway 31).
2.6. Cooperative Weather Watch. A Cooperative Weather Watch is the name given for the
cooperation between weather personnel and control tower operators in identifying significant
weather changes. The primary concern is the occurrence of previously unreported weather
conditions that could affect flight safety or could be critical to the safety or efficiency of other
local operations and resources. Due to the weather technician‘s limited view of the horizon,
ATC tower personnel will notify the weather technician of the occurrence of previously
unreported weather conditions. The assistance provided by tower personnel will not interfere
with their primary duties and does not reduce the responsibility of weather personnel to identify
changes in weather conditions.
2.7. Eyes Forward.
   2.7.1. The Weather Flight integrates weather radar data, meteorological satellite imagery,
   lightning detection readouts, and non-standard weather data systems to create an integrated
   weather picture and near-term trend forecast for the 25 OWS South Flight (25 OWS/WXAS).
   Eyes forward yields meaningful meteorological information not contained in coded
   observations to the OWS and is an integral part of the METWATCH for CAFB. Further,
   during inclement weather or anticipated inclement weather, frequent Weather Flight/OWS
   discussions ensure all WWAs are issued with the required amount of lead time. The Weather
   Flight will contact 25 OWS/WXAS when:
       2.7.1.1. Severe weather signatures on radar displays or METSAT imagery are identified
       that will affect the Cannon AFB installation or mission(s). Also contact the Albuquerque
       National Weather Service Office at 1-888-386-7637 to alert them of possible severe
       weather signatures for east/central New Mexico within 30 miles of Cannon AFB and/or
       Melrose Range.
       2.7.1.2. Warning/advisory criteria are occurring or forecast to occur and 25 OWS/WXA
       has yet to issue the warning/advisory. If severe weather rapidly develops and a weather
       warning needs to be issued to ensure protection of 27 SOW assets, the Weather Flight
       will issue the warning. Weather Flight will ensure 25 OWS/WXA receives all severe

      weather reports in the area of concern (e.g., from National Weather Service, local news
      media, and unit/base personnel).
2.8. Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).
   2.8.1. TAF Issuance. The 25 OWS weather technicians will prepare and disseminate a TAF
   at 0200Z, 1000Z, and 1800Z. The 25 OWS weather technicians will also prepare a Mission
   Operating Airspace Forecast (MOAF) for Melrose Range one hour after TAF issuance.
   2.8.2. Dissemination. The 25 OWS will disseminate the TAF over JET, if JET is
   inoperative, the 25 OWS will use backup procedures to send the TAF.

   5.1.1. The 25 OWS and the Weather Flight will jointly monitor observed and forecast
   weather conditions and notify selected agencies when WWA conditions occur or are
   expected to occur.
   5.1.2. Desired Lead Time. The desired lead-time is the minimum amount of advanced
   notice an agency requires prior to the onset of a specific weather event. The advance notice
   or ‗heads up‘ of threatening weather conditions allows local agencies to take specific actions
   prior to weather event occurrence.
   5.1.3. It will be understood that all CAFB WWAs are valid within 5 NM of the center of
   runway complex. It will be further understood that all Melrose Air Force Range (MAFR)
   WWAs will be valid within 5 NM of the range control tower. This allows the Weather Flight
   and 25 OWS to track all issued warnings and advisories for quality control purposes.
   5.1.4. All WWAs are issued IAW AFMAN 15-129. Warnings and advisories may be issued
   as forecast or observed.
5.2. Responsibilities.
   5.2.1. The 25 OWS will:
       5.2.1.1. Perform a continuous Terminal METWATCH for CAFB.
       5.2.1.2. Issue all watches, forecast weather warnings, and forecast weather advisories.
       During airfield closure, the 25 OWS will issue all WWAs for both CAFB and MAFR.
   5.2.2. The Weather Flight will:
       5.2.2.1. Perform eyes forward function. Assist with METWATCH for the CAFB
       terminal area and advise the 25 OWS when hazardous conditions that could affect CAFB,
       or pose a hazard to life or property, are observed or expected to occur.
       5.2.2.2. Issue all observed weather advisories and the observed weather warnings. When
       the Weather Flight is closed, the 25 OWS assumes the issuance and dissemination of
       WWA responsibilities.
       5.2.2.3. Notify the 25 OWS when local mission-watch indicates a 25 OWS-issued WWA
       is, or may become, unrepresentative of current or expected weather conditions.
   5.2.3. The 27 SOW Installation Command Center will:
       5.2.3.1. Monitor weather information disseminated over JET (or IWWCS).
       5.2.3.2. Disseminate WWAs to required agencies.
   5.2.4. Airfield Operations will:
       5.2.4.1. Monitor weather information disseminated over JET.
       5.2.4.2. Disseminate WWAs to airborne aircraft.

5.6. Dissemination of WWAs. All WWAs will be disseminated using JET. If the JET is
inoperative, WWAs will be disseminated by phone to the same agencies. If further
complications develop, use the primary and back-up dissemination procedures as written in
Attachment 4.
5.7. WWA Text Format. The text of WWAs will contain the WWA number, the specific valid
time period (until further notice for observed products), and specific conditions expected. They
will be numbered consecutively with the # of the month, and the # of the warning. For example,
the first warning issued in March will be #3-1, the next is #3-2. A warning for observed
lightning is the only criterion that will be issued separately from other warning criteria. More
than one advisory may be in effect at the same time. The following additional requirements
apply to warnings issued for criteria other than observed lightning.
    5.7.1. With the exception of lightning warnings, only one warning will be in effect at any
    given time, and it will include all elements meeting warning criteria.
    5.7.2. Warnings issued to add or delete a weather phenomenon (for example, increasing the
    winds to ―winds >/= 50 knots to an existing moderate thunderstorm warning) will include the
    explanation ―This warning upgrades/downgrades Weather Warning # (previous warning).‖
       5.7.2.1. UPGRADES. The new warning forecasts more severe weather.
       5.7.2.2. DOWNGRADES. The new warning forecasts less severe weather.
       5.7.2.3. EXTENDS. The valid period of a previously issued warning is extended.
    5.7.3. Warnings and watches issued to extend the valid time will not be re-issued or re-
    numbered. These will include the explanation ―This is an extension of Weather Warning #
    (current warning).‖
    5.7.4. When the weather technician believes that phenomena meeting WWA criteria are no
    longer expected during the valid time, they will be canceled with the explanation ―Weather
    Warning # (current warning) is canceled.‖
5.8. Severe Weather Action Procedures (SWAP). These procedures are in place to ensure
sufficient personnel are available during potential and actual severe weather events or during
meteorological/operational events critical to mission success. It is imperative that timely and
accurate WWAs are disseminated to all Cannon agencies to ensure personnel and resource
protection. These procedures document a two-tier system with the Weather Flight and the
25 OWS sharing responsibilities for SWAP and resource protection.
    5.8.1. Weather Flight Responsibilities. During SWAP conditions, the Weather Flight will
    recall standby personnel IAW AFMAN 15-129.
       5.8.1.1. Notification. 25 OWS will notify the Weather Flight if any of the SWAP criteria
       in Table 5.2 is occurring or is expected to occur within the next 4 hours. When the

     airfield is closed, 25 OWS will contact the Weather Flight standby forecaster. Upon
     Weather Flight contact, 25 OWS and Weather Flight personnel will jointly evaluate the
     weather situation and decide whether to recall the Severe Weather Action Team (SWAT).
     25 OWS will provide backup SWAT support for the Weather Flight in the event of
     communications failure, equipment outages, personnel unavailability, etc.
         5.8.1.1.1. During normal staff duty hours (0730 to 1700, Monday through Friday,
         except federal holidays/authorized down days) the weather technician will implement
         SWAP by notifying the Weather Flight Commander, NCOIC, Wing Weather Officer
         (WWO) and/or SWAT standby member(s). In the event member(s) are not present at
         the weather station, use the Weather Flight recall roster to notify members not
         present.
         5.8.1.1.2. During nights, weekends and federal holidays/authorized down days, the
         weather technician will implement SWAP by notifying the SWAT standby member,
         as indicated on the current duty schedule, by home phone or cell phone.
     5.8.1.2. Activation. The weather person on duty will discuss the meteorological
     situation, manning requirements, and the recall of additional personnel (or place on
     standby) with the SWAT standby member. If the SWAT standby member is unavailable,
     coordinate with the Weather Flight Commander, NCOIC, WWO, or Weather Flight
     assistant NCOIC. Upon notification, the SWAT standby member will report to the
     weather station as soon as possible.
     5.8.1.3. Upon arrival at the weather station, the SWAT standby member will conduct a
     METCON with the 25 OWS Technician/Zone Supervisor or Shift Duty Officer (SDO).
     5.8.1.4. The FMQ-19 will be placed in Supplement Mode within 90 minutes of the
     expected onset of severe weather. If the Weather Flight is closed and a SWAT member
     is reporting for SWAP duty, the FMQ-19 will be placed on Supplement Mode upon
     arrival.
     5.8.1.5. If the event is to be used as one of the semi-annual SWAP tests, complete a
     memorandum for record documenting the event. Also, contact 25 OWS South Flight
     leadership and provide them with the memorandum or an e-mail for their records.
  5.8.2. OPREP-3 Reporting procedures. When severe weather occurs the Weather Flight will
  provide data to the Installation Command Center for inclusion in the OPREP-3 (Attachment
  3). A courtesy copy of an OPREP-3 BEELINE report will be sent to AFSOC/A3W to one of
  the      following         email     addresses:       afsoc.a3w@hurlburt.af.mil       or
  afsoc.a3w@afsoc.af.smil.mil.
  5.8.3. The Weather Flight personnel‘s home phone numbers, cell phone numbers and pager
  numbers will be reviewed monthly or when a change in personnel occurs to ensure the most
  current numbers are available for SWAP. Current contact numbers are forwarded to
  Installation Command Center, 27 SOSS leadership, and posted on the SOSS recall roster
  which is found on SharePoint.

           WEATHER WARNING /WATCH NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES

A4.1. The JET is the primary method of disseminating weather advisories, warnings and
watches to 27 SOW agencies.
A4.2. When the JET is inoperable, notifications from weather will be done via telephone to the
27 SOW/CP, 27 SOSS/OSAT, 27 SOSS/OSAR, and the 27 SOMXG/MOCC.
   A4.2.1. The Primary method of disseminating weather advisories, warnings and watches
   from the 27 SOW/CP to installation users is through the use of computer pop-up‘s with the
   ReachPlus Pop-up notifications. A select few users are also notified via radio. The
   installation LAN protocol, for all NIPRNET (unclassified work station) users is configured
   so that pop-up messages transmitted by the CP will be received by all (installation and host)
   computer users immediately, within 3 minutes of transmission.
   A4.2.2. The Back-up method of disseminating weather advisories, warnings and watches,
   when the pop-up system is down or major computer outages are present, will be via
   phone/conference calls, radio, Giant Voice, and email.
A4.3. Organizations will establish their own Primary and Back-up weather dissemination
checklists, as required, to ensure all other internal and subordinate agencies/units are notified as
required of advisories and warnings.
A4.4. The 27 SOW/ICC primary notification matrix appears below.
   A4.4.1. Notify MOC for all WWAs.
   A4.4.2. Notify Weather when airfield is closed.
   A4.4.3. The JET is the primary method of disseminating weather WWAs to 27 SOW/ICC,
   27 SOSS/OSA, and 27 SOW/MOCC agencies.
   A4.4.4. Upon receipt, the 27 SOW/ICC, 27 SOSS/OSA, and 27 SOW/MOCC will notify all
   agencies within their lanes of responsibility.
