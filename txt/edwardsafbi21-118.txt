Management of Records, and disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management
System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). This instruction gives block-by-block
descriptions and examples on how to fill in the Edwards AFB Forms 5258(1-4) System
Effectiveness Data System (SEDS) data collection forms. This instruction can be used as an
example and may be supplemented at any level. This instruction applies to test organizations
utilizing Edwards Forms 5258 (1-4) to document maintenance activities. Refer recommended
changes and questions to the Office of Primary Responsibility using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the
appropriate functional chain of command. The data collected on the Edwards AFB Forms 5258
(1-4) consist of on- and off-equipment maintenance actions used to repair or service equipment,
built- in test failure indications, piece-parts used in a repair, and the amount of time the test article
is operated. These data are processed and analyzed after being entered into the SEDS database
program. The SEDS database program is used to process, review, categorize, and analyze the

resulting reliability and maintainability data. One or more Edwards AFB Form 5258-1 or
5258-2, Reliability and Maintainability Report(s) is/are filled in by a reliability and
maintainability (R&M) data collector for each maintenance event. The completed forms are sent
to the project engineer for entry into the System Effectiveness Database System. The Edwards
AFB Form 5258-3, Reliability and Maintainability Mission Log is filled in for whatever
period is established by the project engineer. The completed forms are sent to the project
engineer at the end of the specified period. The Edwards AFB Form 5258-4, Reliability &
Maintainability Data Collection Form for Contractors is used when a simplified data
collection form is needed to capture the basic information needed for a reliability and
maintainability evaluation. The form was designed so no accompanying instructions would be
needed by a technician to fill it in.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The publication has been substantially revised. This rewrite was done to reflect changes in what
data is collected and added a new form. Many changes were made to the block descriptions for
clarity and applicability to many types of test systems. The EDWARDSAFB Form 5258-1 and
5258-2 had all of the block number renumbered. The mission number (Block 15) was modified
to include the mission segment. Three new blocks were added for the Symbol, Repeat, and Recur
(Blocks 16, 17, and 18). The flight test deficiency and technical publication deficiency section
(Block 54) had two elements deleted and was renumbered. The EDWARDSAFB Form 5258-3
was completely redesigned and the block descriptions were changed to reflect the new form.
The new EDWARDSAFB Form 5258-4 was added to the instruction.

          EDWARDS AFB FORM 5258 VERSION GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS

Section 1A—Overview

1.1. Form Ve rsions. There are four versions of the Edwards AFB Form 5258. The Edwards
AFB Form 5258-1 is used to record all equipment maintenance. An abbreviated Edwards AFB
Form 5258-2 is available for situations where built- in test (BIT) data need to be recorded after a
mission is completed (e.g. a master fault list). The Edwards AFB Form 5258-3 is used to record
mission duration (e.g. time, cycles, or miles) and test item operational status. The Edwards AFB
Form 5258 4 is an abbreviated form used to collect only essential maintenance data.
1.2. Additional Information. Additional information on SEDS and the Edwards AFB Form
5258 can be obtained from the Reliability and Maintainability Integration Flight, 773d Test
Squadron, 412th Test Engineer Group, 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base. Air Force
TO 00-20-1 Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and
Procedures and TO 00-20-2 Maintenance Data Documentation were the sources of maintenance
codes used in this document. Specific applications shall refer to their respective –06 technical
order.

Section 1B—Roles and Responsibilities

1.3. Responsibilities of the Joint Reliability and Maintainability Review Board. The
AFI21-118 required that maintenance be documented and AFI99-103 requires the reliability and
maintainability data be collected, analyzed, verified, and categorized. In a typical reliability and
maintainability test program there will be a test agency in charge of documenting maintenance
during the tests. The Program Manager or AFOTEC Joint Reliability and Maintainability
Evaluation Team (JRMET) chairpersons are responsible for ensuring this occurs.
1.4. Responsibilities of the Lead Developmental Test Organization. The lead developmental
test organization is responsible for implementing the test and collecting the data for review and
use by the test community. Day-to-day data collection is usually delegated to the maintenance
organization or a team of observers that supports the tests. The collected data is documented on
the EAFB Form 5258 and input into the SEDS database by the test team.

   11      End Item Serial Number
2.3. A new Edwards AFB Form 5258-1: must be started for each different test item (e.g.
different aircraft, etc.) or when the end item changes (e.g. engine is removed from an aircraft and
work is done on the engine while it is off the aircraft, etc.).
2.4. All work in the same job must be docume nted under the same job control number
(JCN): using separate work center event (WCE) numbers. Use the reference JCN block to
reference a related job (e.g. a cannibalization of a part from one aircraft to another aircraft, etc.).
2.5. Post-flight built-in test indications from a download shall be docume nted using the
5258-2. If BIT is used during maintenance it shall be documented on the 5258-1 used to
document the maintenance.

A6.1. The following list of action taken codes (ATC) is provided as a sample. The list can
be tailored to the needs of the test program. A complete list of action taken codes are presented
TO 00-20-2.

Table A6.1. Action Taken Codes
   Action
 Taken Code                            Action Taken Code (ATC) Definition
     0           Bench Checked – Non-repairable this station (NRTS) Warranty Item: Repair
                 not authorized, item under warranty.
       1         Bench Checked – NRTS (Not Reparable This Station) -- Repair not Authorized
                 -- Shop is not authorized to accomplish the repair. This code shall only be used
                 when the repair required to return an item to serviceable status is specifically
                 prohibited by current technical directives. This code shall not be used due to
                 lack of authority for equipment, tools, facilities skills, parts, or technical data.
       2         Test/Inspect -- NRTS -- Lack of Equipment, Tools, Skills, or Facilities --
                 Repair authorized but cannot be accomplished due to lack of equipment, tools
                 or facilities. This code shall be used without regard as to whether the
                 equipment, tools, or facilities are authorized or unauthorized. May be used for
                 on-equipment when an end item is returned to depot.
       3         Bench Checked -- NRTS -- Due to Lean Logistics Policy. Repair could not be
                 accomplished due to parts non-availability within the time limit imposed by
                 Lean Logistics Policy.
       4         Bench Checked -- NRTS -- Lack of Parts -- Parts are not available to
                 accomplish repair.
       5         Bench Checked -- NRTS -- Shop Backlog -- Repair cannot be accomplished
                 due to excessive shop backlog.
       6         Bench Checked -- NRTS -- Lack of Technical Data -- Repair cannot be
                 accomplished due to lack of maintenance manuals, drawings, etc., which
                 describe detailed repair procedures and requirements.
       7         Bench Checked -- NRTS--Lack of Equipment, Tools, Facilities, Skills, Parts or
                 Technical Data – Repair authorized but cannot be accomplished due to lack of
                 authorization to obtain or possess required equipment, tools, facilities, skills,
                 parts, or technical data.
       8         Bench Checked -- Return to Depots -- Returned to depots by direction of
                 system manager (SM) or item manager (IM). Use only when items that are
                 authorized for base-level repair are directed to be returned to depot facilities by
                 specific written or verbal communication from the IM or SM, or when items are
                 to be returned to depot facilities for modification in accordance with a time-
                 compliance technical order (TCTO), or as MDR exhibits.

   Action
 Taken Code                           Action Taken Code (ATC) Definition
     9        Bench Checked -- Condemned -- Item cannot be repaired and is to be processed
              for condemnation, reclamation or salvage. This code will also be used when a
              "Condemned" condition is discovered during field maintenance disassembly or
              repair.
     A        Bench Checked and Repaired -- Bench check and repair of any one item is
              accomplished at the same time (also see code F).
     B        Bench checked -- serviceable (for off-equipment work only) -- Item is bench
              checked and no repair is required. This code will be used when it is definitely
              determined that the reported discrepancy does not exist or cannot be replicated.
              Must be used with How Malfunction Code 672, 799, 812, or 948. Bench Check
              Serviceable (BCS) is the terminology for base-level action taken code B and
              Retest Okay (RTOK) is the terminology for depot-level action taken code B.
     C        Bench checked-repair deferred -- Bench check is accomplished and repair
              action is deferred (See code F).
     D        Bench checked-transferred to another base or unit -- Item is bench checked at a
              forward operating base, dispersed operating base, or enroute base and is found
              unserviceable and transferred to a main operating base or home base for repair.
              Not used for items returned to depot for overhaul. Used also for precision
              measurement equipment or other equip sent to another base/unit for bench
              check, calibration, or repair to be returned and for item forwarded to contractors
              on base level jobs.
     E        Initial installation -- For installation actions not related to a previous removal
              action such as installation of additional equipment or installation of an item to
              remedy a ship-short condition. Must use with How Malfunction code 799.
     F        Repair -- Not to be used to code "On-Equipment" work if another code will
              apply. When it is used in shop environment, this code will denote repair as a
              separate unit of work after a bench check. Shop repair includes the total repair
              man-hours and includes cleaning, disassembly, inspection, adjustment,
              reassembly and lubrication of minor components incident to the repair when
              these services are performed by the same work center. For precision
              measurement equipment, this code will be used only when calibration of
              repaired item is required (See code G).
     G        Repairs and/or replacement of minor parts, hardware, and softgoods (seals,
              gaskets, electrical connectors, fittings, tubing, hose, wiring, fasteners, vibration
              isolators, brackets, etc.) -- Work unit codes do not cover most non-reparable
              items; therefore, when items such as those identified above are repaired or
              replaced, this action taken code will be used. When this action taken code is
              used, the work unit code will identify the assembly being directly related to
              parts being repaired.

  Action
Taken Code                          Action Taken Code (ATC) Definition
    H        Equipment checked -- no repair required (for "On-Equipment " work only) all
             discrepancies which are checked and found to require no further maintenance
             action. This code will be used only if it is definitely determined that a reported
             deficiency does not exist or cannot be duplicated. Must be used with How
             Malfunction code 672, 799, 812 or 948. Cannot Duplicate (CND) is the
             terminology for all on-equipment action taken code H maintenance actions.
     J       Calibrated -- no adjustment required -- Use this code when an item is calibrated
             and found serviceable without need for adjustment, or is found to be in
             tolerance but is adjusted merely to peak or maximize the reading. If the item
             requires adjustment to actually meet calibration standards or to bring in
             tolerance, use code K.
     K       Calibrated -- Adjustment Required -- Item must be adjusted to bring it in
             tolerance or meet calibration standards. If the item was repaired or needs repair
             in addition to calibration and adjustment, use code F.
     L       Adjust -- Includes adjustments necessary for safety and proper functioning of
             equipment such as adjust, bleed, balance, rig, fit, reroute, seat/reseat,
             position/reposition, program/reprogram, or actuating reset button, switch or
             circuit breaker. For use when a discrepancy or condition is corrected by these
             types of actions. If the identified component or assembly also requires
             replacement of bits and pieces as well as adjustment, enter the appropriate
             repair action taken code instead of L.
     M       Disassemble -- Disassembly action when the complete maintenance job is
             broken into parts and reported as such. Do not use for on-equipment work.
     N       Assemble -- Assembly action when the complete maintenance job is broken
             into parts and reported as such. Do not use for on-equipment work.
     P       Removed -- Item is removed and only the removal is to be accounted for. This
             instance delayed or additional actions will be accounted for separately (see
             codes Q, R, S, T, and U).
     Q       Installed -- Item is installed and only the installation action is to be accounted
             for (see codes E, P, R, S, T, and U).
     R       Remove and Replace -- Item is removed and another like item is installed (see
             codes T and U) and removal and/or replacement of subassemblies from their
             next higher assembly.
     S       Remove and Reinstall -- Item is removed and the same item reinstalled (see
             codes T and U). Must be used with How Malfunction code 800, 804 or 805.
     T       Removed for Cannibalization -- A component is cannibalized. The work unit
             code will identify the component being cannibalized. Must be used with How
             Malfunctioned code 799 or 875.
     U       Replaced after Cannibalization -- This code will be entered when a component
             is replaced after cannibalization. Must be used with How Malfunctioned code
             799 or 875.

 Taken Code                         Action Taken Code (ATC) Definition
     V        Clean -- Cleaning is accomplished to correct discrepancy and/or cleaning is not
              accounted for as part of a repair action such as code F. Includes washing, acid
              bath, buffing, sand blasting, degreasing, decontamination, etc. Cleaning and
              washing of complete items such as ground equipment vehicles, missiles, or
              airplanes should be recorded by utilizing support general codes.
     W        Nondestructive Inspection.
     X        Test-Inspection-Service -- Item is tested or inspected or serviced (other than
              bench check) and no repair is required. This code does not include servicing or
              inspection chargeable to support general work unit codes. Will be used when
              documenting time against a Reported Discrepancy identifying a test, inspect or
              service toward an item for On- and Off-Equipment maintenance which is
              unrelated to a CND action. Will be used when a Reported Discrepancy
              identifying a Deficiency toward a work unit code item is identified to be
              "Within Limits", with the appropriate no defect How Malfunction code W.
     Y        Troubleshoot -- Time expended in locating a discrepancy is great enough to
              warrant separating the troubleshoot time from the repair time. Use of this code
              necessitates completion of two separate line entries, or two separate forms, one
              for the troubleshoot phase and one for the repair phase. When recording the
              troubleshoot time separate from the repair time, the total time taken to isolate
              the primary cause of the discrepancy should be recorded utilizing the work unit
              code of the defective item or assembly. If the discrepancy was not isolated, the
              subsystem or system work unit code should be U.
     Z         Corrosion Treatment -- Includes cleaning, treating, priming, and painting of
              corroded or repaired components and deteriorated coatings. This code should
              always be used when actually treating corroded items or those with deteriorated
              paint. The item that is corroded or has damaged paint will be identified by the
              work unit code (also see support general code 09000).
