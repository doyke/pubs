1. GENERAL POLICY
    1.1. Overview. To improve the Commander Air Force Forces/Joint Force Air Component
    Commander’s (COMAFFOR/JFACC) ability to integrate space capabilities in the
    battlespace, HQ AFSPC assigned each regional Combatant Commander/Air Force
    Component NAF (CCDR/C-NAF) a permanent party Director of Space Forces
    (DIRSPACEFOR or DS4). The DS4 serves as the senior space advisor to the COMAFFOR
    or COMAFFOR/JFACC. The DS4 conducts coordination, integration, and staffing activities
    to tailor space support for the COMAFFOR/JFACC, to include providing support for joint
    space operations to the Space Coordinating Authority (SCA). The DS4 is a senior Air Force
    officer with space expertise and theater familiarity, nominated by AFSPC/CC and appointed
    by the respective COMAFFOR. The DS4 is attached to the COMAFFOR, and should be part
    of the COMAFFOR or COMAFFOR/JFACC’s special staff. When the COMAFFOR serves
    as the JFACC and is designated the SCA, the DIRSPACEFOR typically accomplishes the
    day-to-day duties assigned to the SCA. For those regional CCDR C-NAFs which have an O-
    6 permanent party DS4, HQ AFSPC expects the permanent party DS4 will lead space
    capability integration during real-world contingencies, exercises and wargames impacting
    their AOR. For those regional CCDR C-NAFs which have an O-5 permanent party DS4, HQ
    AFSPC will ensure there is a cadre of properly trained O-6 DS4s available to support real-
    world contingencies, exercises and wargames impacting their area of responsibility, on an
    "as-requested" basis. Table 1 provides details on DS4s currently assigned worldwide.

     their AORs, on an "as-requested" basis.
         2.4.2.1. AFSPC/A1 will identify qualified contingency O-6 DS4s based on the
         mandatory requirements and highly desired attributes defined above. AFSPC/A1 will
         provide AFSPC/A3T an annual prioritized list of candidates approved by the
         AFSPC/CV or designated representative. AFSPC/A3T will schedule training for
         identified contingency DS4s based on AFSPC/A1 prioritization and schedule
         availability. Table 2 details exercises likely to be used as training events for DS4
         selectees.
     2.4.3. O-5 Permanent DS4s. As sitting O-5 DS4s approach the end of their tours, the
     billet owner will submit a personnel requisition for a replacement through the Air Force
4                                                                 AFSPCI10-202 1 JULY 2009

    2.5. Training. Formal DS4 training is conducted through two courses. The courses need
    not occur in a specific order. The Commander of the 614 AOC may also attend these courses
    in order to provide a similar foundation for forward theater space personnel and their primary
    reachback interface for operational space matters.
       2.5.1. Director of Space Forces Course. The DS4 course is conducted at the National
       Security Space Institute (NSSI), in Colorado Springs, CO. This is a five-day course
       designed to educate and train leaders on how to integrate space into theater operations
       and advise the C/JFACC on the Space Coordinating Authority (SCA) role. Updates to
       NSSI curriculum should be made based on common tasks amongst theaters.
       2.5.2. Joint Air and Space Operations Senior Staff Course (JSSC). JSSC is a five-day
       course hosted at Hurlburt Field, FL. This course prepares the DS4 to perform leadership
       responsibilities in a Combined/Joint Air and Space Operations Center (C/JAOC).
       2.5.3. Joint Combat Aviation Prep conference (USCENTCOM DS4 only). The
       USCENTCOM DS4 will also attend the Joint Combat Aviation Prep (JCAP) conference.
       The 561st Joint Tactics Squadron hosts the JCAP conference three times a year in
       cooperation with the Joint Special Operations Command. The audience for the JCAP is
       those units preparing to deploy to OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM/OPERATION
       ENDURING FREEDOM in the next 5 months. The intent is to provide a forum for
       education on the latest theater lessons learned and tactics, techniques and procedures.
       The JCAP also provides a venue for cross service, cross domain, and cross weapon
       system integration.
       2.5.4. The C-NAF has no specified responsibility to prepare incoming DS4s before
       arrival. However, sitting DS4s are encouraged to begin an informal spin-up process as
       early as possible to minimize transition difficulties. The incoming DS4 may also find on-
       site/theater specific requirements upon arrival into the theater.
AFSPCI10-202 1 JULY 2009                                                                    5


      2.5.5. AFSPC/A3 may grant waivers to the training stipulated above as required.
3. AFSPC Responsibilities.
   3.1. DS4 Support Staff. With the exception of the AFCENT DS4, AFSPC will not
   regularly provide a DS4 support staff. The DS4 is encouraged to work with existing space
   personnel embedded in traditional AOC Divisions to obtain support.                   During
   contingency/exercise operations, AFSPC will provide augmentation to the DS4 as specified
   by the appropriate Time Phased Force Deployment Document (TPFDD). DS4s are
   encouraged to ensure their manning requirements are adequately addressed in advance of a
   contingency so that AFSPC can provide timely assistance. If a DS4 support staff is expected
   to be needed during a contingency, AFSPC also encourages the concept to be exercised as
   applicable during appropriate theater/CCDR exercises.
      3.1.1. Permanent Deputy DS4. The Deputy DS4, if assigned, is a permanent position
      joint assignment normally managed by the Department of the Army. Contact the US
      Army Space and Missile Defense Command/US Army Strategic Command
      (USA/SMDC/ARSTRAT) at DSN 692-8886 or commercial (719) 554-8886 for
      additional details.
      3.1.2. Contingency/Exercise Deputy DS4. During exercises or contingencies where a
      permanent O-5 DS4 is augmented by an O-6 DS4, the regular O-5 DS4 will normally
      transition to the Deputy DS4 role. The Department of the Army may also deploy a
      Deputy DS4 to assist with SCA responsibilities.
   3.2. Staff Assistance. The DS4 will normally work space operational requirements through
   United States Strategic Command’s (USSTRATCOM) Joint Functional Component
   Commander for Space (JFCC SPACE) via the Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC). In
   circumstances requiring assistance for Air Force service related issues, the DS4 should
   request assistance through 14 AF (AFSTRAT)/A3 at 14af/a3workflow@vandenberg.af.mil.
   14 AF (AFSTRAT) will reachback to HQ AFSPC as required to address the functions of
   organization, training or equipment. 14 AF (AFSTRAT) will notify AFSPC/A3T at
   A3T.wf@peterson.af.mil of all service related requests for assistance and advise whether
   MAJCOM support is required. AFSPC/A3T will work with other divisions and directorates
   as required in order to support DS4 requests. AFSPC/A3C will be the OPR for any
   equipment related issues and will advertise the availability of new capabilities.
      3.2.1. Senior Leader Advocacy. AFSPC/A3T will provide AFSPC/A3 a DS4 status
      update monthly or as required in order to ensure senior AFSPC leaders remain apprised
      of issues impacting the DS4.
   3.3. Doctrine Development. AFSPC/A8 will interact with sitting DS4s and other military
   branches (Army, Navy, Marines) to further define roles and responsibilities of the DS4
   position.
