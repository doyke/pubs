1. Program Responsibilities.

   1.1. General Overview. One mission of the 59th Medical Wing (59 MDW) is the
   performance of clinical research, a mission that directly and indirectly supports the USAF
2                                                       59THMDWI40-401 3 NOVEMBER 2005

    Medical Services mission and vision through world-class research towards improvements in
    health care. The search for new knowledge must be based on the highest principles of
    personal integrity and ethical standards, both in the obtaining of new data and the treatment
    of volunteer research participants. It is the policy of the 59 MDW to maintain the highest
    ethical standards in research and to investigate and resolve promptly any instances of alleged
    or apparent research misconduct as defined in Attachment 1.

    1.2. 59 MDW Commander (59 MDW/CC). The 59MDW/CC is responsible for:

       1.2.1. Reviewing all allegations of perceived research misconduct.

       1.2.2. Ensuring notifications are timely and appropriate to headquarters level command
       and appropriate authorities as described below.

    1.3. 59 MDW Investigators. Perform all research in a scientifically valid manner, with
    paramount consideration for protection of the volunteer research participant, and only after
    the research has been reviewed and approved by appropriate levels of authority; to assure all
    gifts are legally proffered to and accepted by 59 MDW.

    1.4. 59 MDW Personnel. Notify the Chief, 59th Clinical Research Division (59 SGUV/CC)
    AFLOA JACC/MLFSC (Medical Law) of any apparent or actual incident of misconduct in
    research.

2. Procedures.

    2.1. Immediate Notification. The 59MDW/CC will notify the Chief, Biomedical Research
    and Compliance Division, Modernization Directorate, Office of the Surgeon General, HQ
    AFMSA/SGRC, immediately in writing, with an explanation of the circumstances, if during
    any phase it is discovered that:

       2.1.1. The public health or safety is at risk.

       2.1.2. The research institution's resources or interests are threatened or at risk.

       2.1.3. Research activities are to be suspended because of the inquiry into or investigation
       of the allegation.

       2.1.4. There is a suspicion that a statute, regulation, code, instruction, or other written
       rule was violated.

       2.1.5. Action to protect the interests of those involved in the inquiry into or investigation
       of the allegation is required from the parent command.

       2.1.6. A premature public disclosure of the inquiry into or investigation of the allegation
       may compromise the process; or
59THMDWI40-401 3 NOVEMBER 2005                                                            3

     2.1.7. The research community or public should be informed.

  2.2. Phases of the Response to an Allegation of Research Misconduct. In order of
  occurrence: Allegation, Inquiry, Investigation, and Adjudication. All active duty members
  suspected of research misconduct will be read their Article 31 rights advisement prior to
  being placed under oath and being interviewed in all phases of the response to an allegation
  of research misconduct. While these phases are considered an administrative process,
  placing individuals under oath (whether for an administrative or judicial action) ensures due
  process for the subject(s) of the inquiry/investigation by holding the individual(s) making the
  allegation and all individuals who might have information regarding the allegations to the
  highest standard, promoting honest testimony. Active duty members are not entitled to legal
  counsel nor any other representation at the interview since the individual(s) will only be
  interviewed for the purpose of answering questions he/she chooses to answer during any
  phase of the process. Since Article 31 rights advisements vary according to the
  circumstances, any interviewer may contact 37 TRW/JA for advice on wording any
  advisement. All subjects and individuals who might have information regarding the
  allegations will respond affirmatively to the following oath prior to being interviewed: “Do
  you affirm (swear) that the testimony you are about to provide shall be the truth, the whole
  truth, and nothing but the truth (so help you God)?” If an individual refuses to be placed
  under oath, they may still be interviewed. However, the Misconduct in Research Committee
  (MRC) will document this refusal in their recommendation to the 59 MDW/CC, and 59
  MDW/CC is entitled to lend less credibility to their testimony on the basis of such refusal.

     2.2.1. Allegation Phase.

         2.2.1.1. Notifications: In addition to the requirements of paragraph 2.1.

             2.2.1.1.1. Any allegation, apparent or actual instance of research misconduct,
             should immediately be brought to the attention of the Chief, 59th Clinical
             Research Division (CRD) (59 SGUV/CC), preferably in writing.

             2.2.1.1.2. The Chief, 59th CRD (59 SGUV/CC) will immediately notify the 59
             MDW Vice-Commander (CV) and 59 MDW/CC.

         2.2.1.2. The 59 MDW/CC will determine whether the allegation concerns research
         misconduct as defined in this instruction and as such is subject to an inquiry. If so,
         the 59 MDW/CC will appoint an impartial MRC consisting of a Chairperson and at
         least three (3) 59 MDW staff members. The individuals selected to review the
         allegation(s) and conduct the inquiry will have the appropriate expertise and have no
         unresolved conflicts of interest to ensure fairness of the process. Non-59 MDW
         committee members may be appointed if deemed necessary to preclude real or
         apparent conflicts of interest.

     2.2.2. Inquiry Phase.
4                                                 59THMDWI40-401 3 NOVEMBER 2005

       2.2.2.1. Notifications: In addition to the requirements of paragraph 2.1.

           2.2.2.1.1. This committee is charged with the responsibility of promptly initiating
           an impartial inquiry into any alleged misconduct and making recommendations to
           the 59 MDW/CC regarding their findings. The inquiry must be completed and the
           59 MDW/CC notified of the results of the inquiry within 60 calendar days unless
           circumstances warrant a longer period. The notification will be in the form of an
           official written report which details the evidence reviewed, summarizes relevant
           interviews including any comments made by the individual(s) accused (all
           interviews should be conducted as noted in 2.2), , and presents the conclusions of
           the inquiry and relevant recommendations. A recommendation to proceed to the
           investigation stage should be based on probable cause to believe that research
           misconduct has occurred.

           2.2.2.1.2. Before the inquiry begins, the committee will send a written
           notification to the individual(s) against whom the allegations have been made.
           This notification will detail the allegation(s) against the subject(s), notify the
           subject(s) that an inquiry committee has been initiated by 59 MDW/CC, inform
           the subject(s) that they will be sent the committees’ official written report 10 days
           prior it being sent to 59 MDW/CC, and assuring the subject(s) that he/she will be
           given 10 calendar days from the date the committee’s written recommendation
           was sent to provide his/her own written response that will become part of the
           record for 59 MDW/CC to review.

       2.2.2.2. If the inquiry takes longer than 60 days to complete, the record of the inquiry
       shall include documentation of the reasons for exceeding the 60-day period.

       2.2.2.3. Detailed documentation of an inquiry to permit a later assessment of the
       reasons that an investigation was or was not warranted will be maintained in a secure
       manner for at least three (3) years after termination of the inquiry.

    2.2.3. Investigation Phase.

       2.2.3.1. Notifications: In addition to the requirements of paragraph 2.1.

           2.2.3.1.1. If, based on the initial inquiry, the 59 MDW/CC determines that an
           official investigation is warranted, HQ AFMSA/SGRC, will be notified in writing
           on or before the date the investigation begins.

           2.2.3.1.2. Research institutions will notify the funding agency (or agencies) of an
           allegation of research misconduct if (1) the allegation involves federally funded
           research (or an application for federal funding) and meets the federal definition of
           research (see glossary of references and supporting information), and (2) if the
           institution’s inquiry into the allegation determines there is sufficient evidence to
           proceed to an investigation. If the investigation involves Department of Health
59THMDWI40-401 3 NOVEMBER 2005                                                           5

           and Human Services (e.g., National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute)
           grant funds, the Director of the Public Health Service’s Office of Research
           Integrity (PHS/ORI) will be notified.

        2.2.3.2. If the findings so warrant, the 59 MDW/CC will order a formal investigation
        by the MRC within 30 days of the completion of the inquiry. The investigation
        normally will include examination of all documentation, including but not necessarily
        limited to relevant research data and proposals, publications, correspondence, and
        memoranda of telephone calls. Whenever possible, interviews should be conducted
        of all individuals involved either in making the allegation or against whom the
        allegation is made, as well as other individuals who might have information regarding
        key aspects of the allegations; complete summaries of these interviews should be
        prepared, provided to the interviewed party for comment or revision, and included as
        part of the investigatory file. This investigation will normally be completed and a
        formal written report presented to the CC within 120 days. (Requirements for
        retention of records are identified in the beginning paragraph of this instruction).

           2.2.3.2.1 Before the formal investigation begins, the MRC will send a written
           notification to the individual(s) against whom the allegations have been made.
           This notification will detail the allegation(s) against the subject(s), notify the
           subject(s) that an investigation has been initiated by 59 MDW/CC, inform the
           subject(s) that they have 7 calendar days to request the opportunity to be
           interviewed by the MRC under oath prior to the completion of the investigation.

        2.2.3.3. A finding of research misconduct requires that:

           2.2.3.3.1. There be a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant
           research community; and

           2.2.3.3.2. The misconduct be committed intentionally, or knowingly, or
           recklessly; and

           2.2.3.3.3. The allegation be proven by a preponderance of evidence.

           2.2.3.3.4 Regarding allegations that a civil or criminal statute was violated, it is
           presumed that any violation of a criminal or civil statute constitutes a significant
           departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community if the
           violation is proven by a preponderance of the evidence to have been committed
           intentionally.

     2.2.4. Adjudication Phase.

        2.2.4.1. Notifications: In addition to the requirements of paragraph 2.1, interim and
        final documentation will be made available to HQ AFMSA/SGRC or Director,
        PHS/ORI as applicable. When an investigation is complete, the research institution
6                                                    59THMDWI40-401 3 NOVEMBER 2005

          will forward to the agency a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report,
          and recommendations made to the institution’s adjudicating official, and the subject’s
          written response to the recommendations (if any). When a research institution
          completes the adjudication phase, it will forward the adjudicating official’s decision
          and notify the agency of any corrective actions taken or planned. Applicable
          notification should also be made within 24 hours of obtaining a reasonable indication
          of possible criminal violations.

          2.2.4.2. Interim administrative actions, as appropriate, will be undertaken by 59
          MDW to protect any federal funds involved and to ensure that the purposes of the
          financial assistance are being carried out.

          2.2.4.3. Appropriate sanctions or disciplinary actions, based on the degree of severity
          of the misconduct, will be imposed by the 59 MDW/CC. In deciding what
          administrative actions are appropriate, the agency should consider the seriousness of
          the misconduct, including, but not limited to, the degree to which the misconduct was
          knowing, intentional, or reckless, was an isolated event or part of a pattern, or had
          significant impact on the research record, research subjects, other researchers,
          institutions, or the public welfare.

          2.2.4.4. Possible Administrative Actions. Administrative actions available include,
          but are not limited to, appropriate steps to correct the research record, letters of
          admonishment, the imposition of special certification or assurance requirements to
          ensure compliance with applicable regulations or terms of an award; suspension or
          termination of an active award; or suspension and debarment in accordance with
          applicable government-wide rules on suspension and debarment. In the event of
          suspension or debarment, the information is made publicly available through the List
          of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement and Non-Procurement Programs
          maintained by the U.S. General Services Administration. With respect to
          administrative actions imposed on government employees, the agencies must comply
          with all relevant federal personnel policies and laws.

          2.2.4.5. In Case of Criminal or Civil Fraud Violations. If the funding agency believes
          that criminal or civil fraud violations may have occurred, the agency shall promptly
          refer the matter to the Department of Justice, the Inspector General for the agency, or
          other appropriate investigative body.

       2.2.5. Separation of Phases. Adjudication is separated organizationally from inquiry and
       investigation. Likewise, appeals are separated organizationally from inquiry and
       investigation.

    2.3. Safeguards.

       2.3.1. Diligent efforts, as appropriate, will be undertaken to restore the reputations of
       persons alleged to have engaged in misconduct when the allegations are not confirmed,
59THMDWI40-401 3 NOVEMBER 2005                                                           7

     and to protect the positions and reputations of those persons, who in good faith, make
     allegations.

     2.3.2. The privacy of those who in good faith report apparent misconduct will be
     protected to the maximum extent possible. Safeguards include protection against
     retaliation for informants who make good faith allegations, fair and objective procedures
     for examination and resolution of allegations of research misconduct, and diligence for
     protecting the positions and reputations of those persons who make allegations of
     research misconduct in good faith.

     2.3.3. The affected individual(s) will be afforded confidential treatment, a prompt and
     thorough investigation, and the opportunity to comment on all allegations and findings of
     the inquiry or investigation. The mere filing of an allegation of research misconduct
     against an individual will not bring their research to a halt or be the basis for other
     disciplinary or adverse action absent other compelling reasons. Other safeguards include
     the timely written notification of subject(s) regarding substantive allegations made against
     them; a description of all such allegations; reasonable access to the data and other
     evidence supporting the allegations; and the opportunity to respond to all allegations, the
     supporting evidence and proposed findings of research misconduct (if any).

     2.3.4. To the extent possible consistent with a fair and thorough investigation and as
     allowed by law, knowledge about the identity of subject(s) and informant(s) is limited to
     those who need to know. Records maintained by the agency during the course of
     responding to an allegation of research misconduct are exempt from disclosure under the
     Freedom of Information Act to the extent permitted by law and regulation.

     2.3.5. These four phases taken in response to an allegation of research misconduct are
     administrative procedures independent of any judicial action under the Uniform Code of
     Military Justice (UCMJ). Nothing in this instruction will impair the independent
     investigation of a member for UCMJ judicial action (e.g., investigation / initiation of a
     court-martial). Therefore, 59 MDW/CC may contact 37 TRW/JA when research
     misconduct has been deemed serious enough to warrant UCMJ judicial action. In
     addition, any member representing the Air Force’s interests during the four phases may
     contact 59 MDW/JA for interpretive guidance on this instruction or 37 TRW/JA
     regarding UCMJ issues
