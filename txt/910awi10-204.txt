calendar of events, and increase deployment status visibility/awareness. It defines procedures
for:
   1.1. Reporting and approval of unit participation in exercises and off-station deployments.
 2                                                                  910AWI10-204 19 JULY 2011

        2.1.1. Named Exercises (Silver Flag, Patriot Tiger, Etc.)
        2.1.2. Composite Force Training (CFT)
        2.1.3. Any operation with foreign nationals in CONUS or OCONUS.
        2.1.4. Joint Operations. This exercise involves operations with units or personnel from
        one or more of the other U.S. services. This does not include routine joint airborne air
        transportability training (JA/ATT). Close Air Support (CAS), Dissimilar Air Combat
        Training (DACT), or air refueling.
        2.1.5. Locally generated exercises.
            2.1.5.1. All units are required to exercise all Unit Type Codes (UTCs) tasked in the
            UTA at least once every 12 months.
            2.1.5.2. Squadron Unit Control Centers (UCCs) will be activated a sufficient number
            of times per year to ensure sufficient training for work-center personnel.
            2.1.5.3. Exercises will be used as an opportunity to validate and update the
            Installation Deployment Plan (IDP).
            2.1.5.4. Exercises will embody the ―train the way we fight‖ concept. Emphasis will
            be on all 910-unit participation and reduced artificiality.
            2.1.5.5. Contractor personnel will NOT be asked to provide support or perform work
            not specified under contract.

        2.2.5. Involves the participation in a named JCS, CINC, Service, or Major Command
        (MAJCOM) exercise.
        2.2.6. (Flying Units) Self-deploying CONUS movements that do not require
        deployment approval must still submit data to 22nd Air Force (22AF) and AFRC to
        appraise the Air Force Reserve Command Commander (AFRC/CC) and staff of unit
        activities and provide data for historical data.

         between the other command and AFRC. AFRC/A3 can validate the status of inter-fly
         agreements.
         2.2.8. Planning Guidelines. When considering the scheduling and planning of off-station
         training deployments, consider the following factors: home-station training capabilities,
