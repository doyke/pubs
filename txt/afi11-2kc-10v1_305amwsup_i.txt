1.1.1. The overall objective of the aircrew training program is to develop and maintain a high
state of mission readiness for immediate and effective employment in exercises, peacekeeping
operations, contingencies, and war. Mission readiness and effective employment are achieved
through the development and mastery of core competencies for KC-10 crewmembers. These
core competencies include the ability to conduct receiver and tanker AAR, tactical ingress,
tactical egress, and tanker operations during all phases of flight, instrument procedures, mission
planning, ground operations, crew management and C4/AOC integration.

1.1.2. Link AFTTP 3-3.KC-10, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals—KC-10, requirements into
mission and continuation training tables while retaining a combat culture, leading edge
technologies, pushing capabilities while anticipating warfighter needs.

1.1.3. The secondary objective is to standardize KC-10 training requirements into a single
document to meet requirements for a basic document in AFPD 11-2, Aircraft Rules and
Procedures.

1.2. Key Words Explained.

1.2.1. "Will" and "shall" indicate a mandatory requirement.

1.2.2. "Should" is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
accomplishment.

1.2.3. "May" indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.

1.2.4. "Note" indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential to
emphasize.

(QAI), and contract compliance evaluation. The contractor will run one quarter (1/4) of the
Qualification Test Guide (QTG) every three months based on actual aircraft data. These tests
will annotate Pass or Fail for each sub-test prior to semi-annual simulator certification. Det 1
AMCAOS will use one simulator period to randomly sample 10% of the QTG. This profile will
be stated in the notification letter to the contractor.

1.4.1.3.1.1. FTD CERT. The Flight Training Device is tested and certified in the same manner
as the simulator except where the fidelity of the device limits the tests. The standards for these
types of devices are derived from FAA AC 120-45A.

1.4.1.3.1.2. SIMCERT. Notify the host unit 45 days in advance of a scheduled SIMCERT. A
short-notice SIMCERT is available with verbal coordination between host unit, DET 1, HQ
AMC/A3TK, ATS contractor, and the ATS contract management team. Report SIMCERT
results to HQ AMC/A3TK and 507 ACSS/GFLC HQ Ogden Air Logistics Center (AFMC).

Simulator use will be on a non-interference basis with contractor concurrence and Det 1/CC
approval.

1.4.1.3.2. ATS Courseware Certification. KC-10 courseware development, revisions, and
acceptance are tracked by mutually accepted process between the government and the ATS
contractor. This process is to review and approve KC-10 courseware for timely delivery,
accuracy, and compliance with the KC-10 Instructional Systems Development (ISD)
Management Plan and USAF courseware standards. The chief of courseware, or appropriate Det
1 courseware representative, will issue final approval for the government after the training media
is ready for implementation at the training sites. Contractual acceptance for the government is
vested in the KC-10 program‘s contracting office located at Hill AFB (507 ACSS/GFLC).

1.4.1.3.2.1. Training Systems Configuration Working Group (TSCWG) will be held monthly or
as specified by the ATS contract, and attended by Det 1 Simcert and Courseware representatives.
The status and disposition of each courseware effort, whether in-scope, out-of-scope, late, or
delayed will be briefed by the ATS contractor courseware staff. Det 1 AMCAOS will alert 507
GFLC and AMC/A3TK of any discrepancies that cannot be resolved through Det 1 and
contractor agreements.

1.4.1.3.2.2. Det 1 AMCAOS will schedule Subject Matter Experts (SME) for Technical

the Group Standardization and Evaluation section and Wing Current Operations. This briefing is
a comprehensive review of quarterly or semi-annual training progresses, simulator usage, and
may include any other training issues deemed necessary by the OG/CC. This briefing includes a
Manning Review Panel (MRP) for the OG/CC (or designated representative) based on the AMC
Training Review Process. The MRP is a tool to measure current and projected manning levels of
the crew forces for the next six months.

1.4.5.1.1. TRP Requirements. Convene the TRP semi-annually and maintain minutes for a
period of two years (commanders may increase this frequency as required). Squadrons and
detachments not collocated with their OG may conduct their own panel or provide representation
to the unit's TRP. Panel minutes from non-collocated squadron and detachment TRPs will be
forwarded to the unit for inclusion in the unit's TRP.

1.4.5.1.2. TRP Format. The TRP should review staff and crewmember management actions
necessary to complete squadron flight and ground training programs. Suggested TRP topics
include, but are not limited to current and forecast Flight Training Levels, (FTL), Upgrade and
Continuation Training status, Semi-annual requirement completion rates, crew position
gains/losses, Aircraft Commander, Instructor and Evaluator upgrades. OG/CC will also review
all unit defined training ―X‖ events for relevancy.

1.4.5.2. ADSCs. The OG/CC will develop and maintain procedures with their local servicing
military personnel flight (MPF) for individual crewmember counseling and personnel system
updates affecting active duty service commitment (ADSC) incurred with training specified in
this AFI. See AFI 11-202 Volume 1, AFI 36-2107, Active Duty Service Commitments (ADSC),

1.4.5.2. (305AMW) Individuals will sign an AF Form 63, Active Duty Service Commitment
Acknowledgement Statement, prior to the start of any training that incurs an active duty service
commitment (ADSC). 305 OSS/OST will notify 87 FSS/DPET Formal Training of individuals
scheduled to attend formal upgrade training courses. 87 FSS/DPET Formal Training will in turn
ensure the AF Form 63 is signed prior to the beginning of training. (Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) individuals will sign a Contract for Air Force Selected Reserve Service
Commitment (RSC) contract prior to the start of any training that incurs a service commitment.
514 OSS/OST will ensure that the contract is signed prior to the beginning of training).

1.4.5.3. The OG/CC may develop additional training requirements and/or programs as necessary
to meet unit mission requirements. Include such requirements in local supplement.

1.4.5.3. (305AMW) Any additional training programs will be coordinated through 305 OSS/OST
(AFRC: 514 OSS/OST) for standardization and, if applicable, appear in subsequent revisions of
this supplement.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                         13


1.4.5.4. OG/CC is responsible for establishing and maintaining the academic training program
for non-ATS courses (may be delegated to squadron level). The OG (or squadron) OPR will:

1.4.5.4.1. Appoint primary and alternate instructors for each non-ATS course to be taught.

1.4.5.4.2. Publish a ground training schedule (AFRC as required) to include date, time, location,
instructor and designated crewmembers for each course (both ATS and non-ATS). Include
details in local supplement.

1.4.5.4.2. (305AMW) A weekly ground training schedule will be posted on the 305 OSS/OST
SharePoint website (https://eim.amc.af.mil/org/305oss/ost/default.aspx), sent via email to the
squadron schedulers, and posted as hardcopy outside the 305 OSS/OST office. Schedulers will
input personnel attending ground training in GDSS2 no later than (NLT) close of business
(COB) two work days prior to training. In order to ensure an even monthly distribution of
annual block training, crewmembers should be scheduled for block training 60 days prior to the
month their small arms training (G280) is due even if they don’t require small arms training
that year. (AFRC ground training requirements will be scheduled by the individual squadrons.)

1.4.5.4.2.1 (Added)(305AMW). Ground training classes will start promptly in accordance with
the weekly ground training schedule. Trainees will report for all classes with appropriate
equipment, and must attend the class in its entirety to receive credit; those who report late to a
class will be turned away. Trainees must satisfy all examination requirements as directed by
applicable regulations/instructions.

1.4.5.4.2.2. (Added)(305AMW) Prior to the start of small arms training, each unit will ensure
individuals have a current AF Form 522, Ground Weapons Training Data in their possession.
Attendees must bring the form to class or the will be turned away. Exception: For individuals
not possessing an AF Form 522 a letter from the squadron training (DOT) section (signed by the
Squadron Commander) is required, stating why the individual doesn‘t have an AF Form 522 and
authorizing the required training.

1.4.5.4.2.3. (Added)(305AMW) Uniform Requirements. All classes are considered military
formations and members will comply with AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air
Force Personnel. Normal Duty uniform is required for ground training and computer based
training learning center programs. See the posted ground training schedule for special uniform
requirements (e.g. Water Survival Training (WST), Combat Survival Training (CST), etc.).

1.4.5.4.2.4. (Added) (305AMW) Ground Training While Deployed. 305/514 OG authorize
ground training to be accomplished at deployed locations. It is at the deployed commander‘s
discretion exactly how and when ground training can or will be accomplished. In addition,
availability of deployed instructors will determine if a class can be taught. 305 OSS/OST
(AFRC: SQ/DOT) is responsible for providing information/materials for the authorized ground
training classes. Instructors must coordinate with 305 OSS/OST (AFRC: SQ/DOT) before
deploying. No coordination is required for web-based training.

1.4.5.4.3. Use MAJCOM, ATS, or unit-developed training products and/or syllabus for all
courses, as applicable. Units will reproduce courseware as applicable.

1.4.5.4.4. Develop a procedure to monitor the academic training program for course content,
currency of materials, instructor availability, and status of training aids. Squadrons should
recommend to the commander changes to existing courses or additional academic training
courses required, based on crewmember feedback.

1.4.5.4.5. Units will develop local procedures for scheduling ATS courses. The unit training
manager is responsible for procedures that minimize schedule changes and maximize training in
the available time. Advise ATS contractor for scheduling changes and special training
requirements.

1.4.5.4.6. Send recommendations for changes, additions, and deletions of courses through
appropriate channels to appropriate MAJCOM with an information copy to HQ AMC/A3T.

1.4.5.5. Instructor Selection and Training. OG/CC (or as delegated/specified in local
supplement) will select course instructors (for non-ATS courses) on the basis of professional
qualification and aptitude to instruct aircrew/students. Local academic instructor program will
follow AFMAN 36-2236, Guidebook for Air Force Instructors. An individual instructor may
receive course credit if instructing the class.

1.4.6. Squadrons.

1.4.6.1. Sq/CC will ensure crewmembers complete in-unit mission, ground and continuation
training according to Table 1.2. Failure to reasonably progress may require action for removal.

1.4.6.2. Before each semi-annual training period the Sq/CC will assign Flying Training Levels
(FTL) and levels of qualification to assigned and attached crewmembers (see Chapter 4). Use
experience and aircraft proficiency as the basis of training level assignments.

1.4.6.3. Sq/CC (or designated representative) will ensure formal school student and supervisor
post-graduate surveys are completed via the KC-10 ATS web page. The student post-graduate
questionnaire will be completed prior to the individual being declared mission ready. The

1.4.6.4. Ensure adequate training continuity and supervision of assigned and attached
crewmembers. Unit commanders may assign additional requirements based on individual
crewmember‘s experience and proficiency.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                         15


1.4.6.5. Sq/CC will review training and evaluation records of newly assigned or attached
crewmembers and those completing formal training to determine the necessary training required
to complete/certify the individual as Basic Aircraft Qualified (BAQ), Basic Mission Capable
(BMC), or Mission Ready (MR). Document this review on AF Form 4023, Aircrew Training
Progress Report as ―initial review.‖

1.4.6.6. Coordinate with the operations group in developing training programs.

1.4.6.7. Review qualifications and monitor training requirements for unit assigned flight
surgeons (FS).

1.4.6.8. Execute unit-level aircrew certifications described in this instruction and local
supplement.

1.4.6.9. Ensure flight commanders or designated squadron representatives monitor quality of
training being accomplished, identifying training deficiencies. Squadron Commanders must be
advised of additional training needs.

1.4.7. Formal School with ATS Contractor. The KC-10 ATS contractor is responsible for
academic and aircrew training device (ATD) instruction at all KC-10 training sites. This
responsibility includes developing, updating and publishing courseware and the formal school
syllabus in accordance with the ATS contract (see ) and published syllabi direction.

1.4.8. Formal School, Non-ATS. See requirements in AFI 11-202, Volume 1.

1.5. Waiver Authority.

1.5.1. Do not deviate from the policies and requirements in this AFI. Report deviations and
exceptions without waiver through channels to MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) who, in turn
should notify the OPR for follow-on action, if required. Units reporting deviations and
exceptions will maintain copies of reported deviations/exceptions for two years. Waiver requests
will include supporting rationale, the training start date, a summary of the unit‘s training plan,
and estimated completion date.

1.5.2. Unless otherwise specified, MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) is the designated waiver
authority for specific aircrew training requirements in this AFI not governed by AFI 11-202,
Volume 1. AMC/A3 designated OG/CC‘s of AMC and AMC-gained units as the waiver
authority for semi-annual requirements mandated in the training tables and currency events of
AFI 11-2MDS Volume 1. Waivers for training or currency events missed in consecutive training
periods will require MAJCOM approval.

1.5.3. OG/CC is designated waiver authority for minimum flying hour prerequisites for entry
into formal upgrade courses (see Table 5.1 and Table 5.3).

1.5.3. (305AMW) Forward flying time waivers for formal school pre-requisites to 305
OSS/OST (514 OSS/OST) no later than 30 days prior to class start date to ensure adequate time
for proper review and approval/disapproval. Waivers not meeting the 30-day suspense must
contain a valid reason for late submittal.

1.5.4. Prerequisites. For waivers to formal school prerequisites see the appropriate formal
course in the ETCA. The site address is: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.

1.5.5. Formal School Training. The gaining unit‘s OG/CC is designated waiver authority for
completion of specific formal school events.

1.5.6. If required for squadron‘s designated mission, accomplish events waived or not
accomplished at formal schools in-unit before assigning mission-ready (MR) status.

1.5.7. Senior Officer Course (SOC) syllabus waiver authority is AMC/A3 with concurrence of
gaining MAJCOM/A3. Refer to AFI 11-202 Volume 1 for SOC policy and eligibility
requirements.

1.5.8. Continuation Training Waivers. The OG/CC (or equivalent) is designated waiver
authority for ground continuation training events identified in Table 4.1, Table 4.2, and Table
4.3 along with semi-annual flying continuation training requirements in Table 4.4 and Table 4.5
for assigned or attached crewmembers. This waiver authority will be used judiciously on a case-
by-case basis. The decision to grant a waiver will be based on the individual crewmember‘s
experience and proficiency level (i.e. waivers will not be based on a crewmember‘s availability).
OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the waiver (e.g., 30-day extension, next
training cycle, etc.). OG/CC should consider if sufficient flying events were accomplished (to
ensure MR proficiency), before waiver approval. The make-up training should be accomplished
at the earliest opportunity. Do not approve a waiver request for the same flying or ground
training event deficiency affecting two consecutive training periods. This waiver is for
unforeseen circumstances only and only for events that will not degrade mission accom-
plishment. Forward all waiver requests for waivers over two consecutive training periods to
MAJCOM/A3T. For all flight currency waiver requests see paragraph 4.9.1.

1.5.8. (305AMW) Squadrons are responsible for providing continuation training waivers to 305
OSS/OST (514 OSS/OST) with sufficient time to process by the end of the currency period.
Include detailed justification for the waiver and, if appropriate, a statement certifying that the
individual was not waived for the same flying training event(s) during the previous period.

1.5.9. Waiver Format. For AMC waivers, use on-line waiver request service on AMC/A3T web
site: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AM-94 . AFRC
units will use the on-line waiver request service on the AFRC/A3T web site:
https://wwwmil.a2a3.afrc.af.mil/A3T/default.htm . Ensure the Volume 1 reference paragraph
to be waived is included in the waiver request. AMC OG/CCs submit waiver request through
AMC/A3T web site. If unable to use the waiver web site submit a written waiver in the format at
Figure 1.1. to the appropriate MAJCOM OPR. AFRC units submit written requests through
AFRC NAF/A3T to HQ AFRC/A3TA. HQ AFRC/A3TA will send response to AFRC unit with
copies to HQ AMC/A3TK. Mark not applicable items as ―N/A.‖ Asterisked (*) items are
required for processing. Place copies of all flying and ground training waivers (including
training time extensions) in the individual's training folder. OG/CC or designated unit agency
will maintain a record of approved waiver(s). Retain unit file copies for a minimum of two years
IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                          17


1.5.9.(305AMW)        WaiverWeb is the primary and preferred method for submitting and
processing waivers. If it is impractical to use the electronic waiver process (e.g., mass waiver),
then complete a paper version IAW AFI 11-2KC-10V1, KC-10 Aircrew Training, Figure 1.1,
and submit it through the appropriate chain of command. It is the responsibility of the office
submitting the waiver to ensure that it is processed in a timely manner. The 305 OSS/OST is the
305 OG/CC‘s designated agency for all waivers concerning aircrew training (AFRC: 514 OG).
OST will continue to maintain a comprehensive log of all waiver action on the AMC
WaiverWeb (https://private.amc.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/waivers/) or a printed copy of the approved paper
waiver (if the electronic waiver was not used) through the appropriate Aircrew
Standardization/Evaluation Visit (ASEV) cycle or two years (whichever is greater). Once final
approval authority has approved/disapproved the waiver request, the submitting organization will
print a copy to be maintained for a minimum of two years IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule
at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims/ and a final copy sent to 305 OSS/OST (AFRC:
Sq/DOT. AFRC WaiverWeb is located at https:wwwmil.a2a3.afrc.af.mil/waivers/frmindex.aspx).

1.6. Use of Flying Hours.

1.6.1. Structure unit flying training missions to achieve optimum training. Any by-product
airlift opportunity resulting from training must not degrade the intended training and will comply
with applicable Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 4515.13-R, Air Transportation
Eligibility, AFI 11-401, Aviation Management and AFI 11-202 Volume 1.

1.6.1.1. It is essential that all personnel at all levels prevent the misuse of air mobility resources
as well as the perception of their misuse when planning and executing local or off-station
training missions.

1.6.1.2. See AMCI 11-208, Tanker/Airlift Operations, for off-station training flight
requirements.

1.6.1.2.(305AMW) Detailed instructions on off-station training flight requirements for McGuire
AFB can be found in the 305th & 514th Air Mobility Wing, Wing Operations & Maintenance
Plan (WOP) Policy Summary located on the Current Operations (OSS/OSO) website.

1.6.2. Training on Operational Missions. Unless specifically prohibited or restricted by weapon
system operating procedures or specific theater operations order (OPORD), the OG/CC may
approve upgrade, qualification or special qualification/certification training on operational
missions. See passenger-carrying restrictions in AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 3, KC-
10 Operations Procedures.

1.6.2.1. Commanders will ensure the training will not impact mission effectiveness and the
crewmember receiving training is under the supervision of an instructor of like specialty. In the
event the mission changes and the training status may affect the ability of the crew to fly the
mission, the Instructor will ensure coordination between OC/CC and 618 TACC prior to
accepting the mission.

1.7. In-Unit Training Time Limitations. Comply with the time limitations in Table 1.2 for
Phase II training. Note: for Phase IA and IB time limitations of formal KC-10 qualification,
upgrade, and requalification courses refer to Table A3.4. Crewmembers entered in an in-unit
training program leading to upgrade qualification (or requalification) should be dedicated to that
program on a full-time basis. In-unit training will begin no later than 45-days (90-days AFRC)
after reporting or being attached to a new duty station or unit.

 NOTES:
 1. For Boom Operator (Basic) Initial Qualification (BBQ) and Flight Engineer Basic
 Prequalification Course (FBP) see Attachment 3.


1.7.1. Training Time. Training time start date is the date when the first significant training event
(a training event directly contributing to qualification or upgrade, e.g. computer-based training
(CBT) lesson, part task trainer (PTT), weapon system trainer (WST), flight training device
(FTD), boom operator trainer (BOT), aircrew system trainer (AST) ground training, flight
training, etc.), or 45 days (90 days AFRC) after being attached or assigned to the unit after
completion of the formal school, whichever occurs first. Training time ends with the successful
completion of one of the following events: flight evaluation (if required as part of the training
program), instructor validation of successful program completion (―sign-off‖), or squadron
commander certification (if required as part of the training program).

1.7.2. Sq/CC may extend training time once up to 60 days (120 days for AFRC) while
completing MCT. Extensions exceeding 60 days (120 days for AFRC) require MAJCOM/A3T
approval. Units will notify (in writing or via web) the appropriate MAJCOM/A3T before the
crewmember exceeds upgrade training time limits in Table 1.2.

1.7.2. (305AMW) In addition to notifying A3T before exceeding training time limits, notify 305
OSS/OST or 514 OSS/OST (via email attachment or hardcopy) as soon as possible. Provide the
same information as required in AFI 11-2KC-10V1, paragraph 1.7.2.1.

1.7.2.1. Use the waiver format as specified in paragraph 1.5.9. Include training difficulty, unit
corrective action to resolve and prevent recurrence, and estimated completion date.

1.7.2.2. If units upgrade or requalify students in-unit, follow timelines from Table A3.6 for
initial qualification (Phase I) and Table 1.2 for mission qualification (Phase II). Sq/CC training
time extensions only apply during the mission qualification phase of training.

1.8. Training Documentation. Units will use the AF Form 4324, Aircraft Assignment/Aircrew
Qualification Worksheet as prescribed by AFI 11-202, Volume 1, to update aircrew certifications
in ARMS. See Chapter 7 for specific ―Q‖ codes. See Attachment 2 for additional training
documentation requirements.

1.9. Flight Examiner Usage. Use flight examiners as instructors for any phase of training to
capitalize on their expertise and experience. Units may use flight examiners as instructors for
qualification, upgrade, and corrective action training. If an examiner is used as a primary
instructor to train an individual, the same examiner should not administer the associated
evaluation.

1.10. Instructor Training and Supervision Requirements:

1.10.1. All instructors should be MR (wing level and below).

1.10.2. Instructor candidates who previously attended a formal instructor school for instructor
qualification and were qualified instructors in any US Air Force aircraft and who meet the
minimum flying hour requirements may upgrade in-unit with OG/CC approval. Sq/CC will
determine training required to complete the instructor upgrade in-unit, including evaluations
IAW AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 2, KC-10 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.

1.10.3. Unit Formal Training Unit (FTU) Instructors. Active duty Operations Support
Squadrons are provided with staff authorizations (pilot, flight engineer, and boom operator) over
and above the crew force. Positions are allocated per AMC manpower standard (AMCMS) to
support initial qualification, requalification, upgrade, and continuation training requirements at
each KC-10 MOB. Personnel assigned to these positions must be very capable, highly
experienced both as instructors and KC-10 aircrew members. All FTU instructors must be
thoroughly familiar with KC-10 course books, training requirements, operational techniques, and
the contractor training program. Assigned instructors will have an associate degree or higher
within one year of being assigned to FTU instructor duty.

1.10.3.1. Faculty Training Course (FTC). The Faculty Training Course is taught at the FTU to
prepare newly assigned instructors for schoolhouse duties. This course will be locally developed
and updated as necessary. All instructors conducting initial qualification flying training should
be graduates of FTC.

1.10.4. Instructor Supervision Requirements. When performing aircrew duties, the following
personnel must be under the supervision of an instructor:

1.10.4.1. All non-current crewmembers. For non-current crewmembers, direct instructor
supervision is required while performing the non-current event. (See paragraph 4.9 for
exceptions).

1.10.4.2. All crewmembers in initial, upgrade or requalification flying training.

1.10.4.3. Any other personnel designated by the Wing/CC, OG/CC, or Sq/CC.

1.10.4.4. All unqualified or flying training level (FTL) ―E‖ crewmembers require direct
instructor supervision (must be at a set of controls) during critical phases of flight. Direct
instructor supervision is required while non-current crewmembers perform non-current event(s)
during a critical phase of flight.

1.10.4.5. Exceptions to paragraph 1.10.4. Supervision Requirements Instructor.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                        21


1.10.4.5.1. Instructor supervision is not required for pilots certified by the Sq/CC to conduct
receiver AAR under the supervision of a Sq/CC certified Aircraft Commander.

1.10.4.5.2. Students in upgrade training may fly, on a limited basis, without instructor
supervision as a crewmember in their previous position provided they are current and qualified in
that position (i.e. an MF in upgrade to IF may fly unsupervised as an MF).

1.10.4.5.3. During FTU training, two KC-10 PIC students (or one PCO student and one KC-10
PIC student) may sit in the seat together for all events in which they are current and qualified.

1.10.4.5.4. For KC-10 PIC training, selected aircraft events (F020-Frmation, F060-AAR
Formation, P005-Taxi Exercise, and R080-Tanker AAR, Autopilot-Off) do not require the KC-
10 PIC student to be at a set of controls; the KC-10 PIC student must demonstrate the ability to
instruct to a proficient level while the event is being accomplished.

1.11. Distribution. Units will establish the necessary hard copy distribution requirements of
this AFI.

1.12. Transfer of Aircrews.

1.12.1. When a crewmember transfers from one unit to another, the gaining unit will review,
assess and assign the appropriate TL. During the review, the gaining unit will normally honor
the losing unit‘s assigned training level. Certified/qualified MR crewmembers transferring
between units accomplish only unit-specific training and any applicable events in which they
have lost currency.

1.12.2. For Foreign Military Sales, guest pilot, and/or exchange officers see training
requirements in AFI 11-401. Initial and/or continuation training requirements are specified in
the appropriate MOU, OPLAN or agreement and should mirror requirements of this AFI to the
maximum extent possible.

1.13. Aircrew Training While DNIF. Crewmembers whose status is duty not including flying
(DNIF) may log ground training events (including simulator) if the member's physical condition
allows it. If the crewmember‘s ability to complete training is in question, consult the flight
surgeon signing the AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendations for Flying or Special
Operational Duty, placing the crewmember in a DNIF status IAW AFI 48-123, Volume 3,
Medical Examinations and Standards, Flying and Special Operational Duty if the DNIF status
includes ground training limitations.

1.14. Aircrew Rated Management Overview.

1.14.1. Program Requirements Document (PRD).            According to AFI 11-412, Aircrew
Management, HQ USAF/A3O-AT projects KC-10 long-range training requirements annually in
a process called the PRD. Lead and user commands contribute to the PRD, which becomes a
key long-range planning tool for training requirements.

1.14.2. Programmed Flying Training (PFT). HQ AMC/A3TF is designated to manage the KC-
10 PFT process in coordination with user commands. The PFT balances available training
22                                            AFI11-2KC-10V1 _305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


quotas, ATS throughput, schoolhouse capacity and course requirements on a fiscal year basis.
Annually, units will send projected PFT requirements (RCS: HAF-XOO(AR) 9722) to their
respective MAJCOM training staff, who in turn, will forward projected requirements to the PFT
manager at HQ AMC/A3TF.

1.14.2. (305AMW) 305 OSS/OST manages the active duty KC-10 Programmed Flying Training
(PFT). Quotas for aircrew training courses are allocated to each active duty unit by 305
OSS/OST. Units will forward student‘s name, rank, social security number, class number and
type of class, or any quota cancellations to 305 OSS/OST no later than 60 days prior to class start
date. OSS/OST maintains the complete guidance on timelines associated with KC-10 formal
schools. 514 OSS/OST manages the Reserve PFT (reference the 514 OSS/OST process guide).
Coordinate changes to the reserve allocations through 514 OSS/OST.

1.14.2.1. An annual PFT conference is held to consider training capacity, MAJCOM training
requests, and pipeline student inputs. Upon validation, HQ AMC/A3TF approves the PFT,
allocating quotas to each command, who in turn allocate training quotas to each unit.

1.14.2.2. Throughout the training year, MAJCOM training staff and AFPC PFT managers use
assigned/allocated training quotas to assign individual crewmembers into the KC-10 formal
school classes. Daily student quota adjustments to the annual PFT are made on quota
management documents. HQ AMC/A3TF will publish the annual PFT quota workbook at:
https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/docman/DOCMain.asp?Tab=0&FolderID=OO-OP-AM-
99-13&Filter=OO-OP-AM-99.

1.15. Information Management. HQ AMC Aircrew Training Division (HQ AMC/A3T) hosts aircrew
training information on a military website. Training event descriptions are maintained on the website, as
well as non-ATS training courses (e.g., GRACC, FM Immunity), ATD status, host nation agreements
(HNA), etc. Site is: https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil/ASPs/CoP/OpenCoP.asp?Filter=OO-OP-AM-94.

1.16. Failure to Progress or Complete Training. If the training received leads to a
qualification or certification that must be met for the unit‘s mission, comply with syllabus
guidelines. If mission ready status does not depend on the training received, then the OG/CC
will decide the course of action. If a crewmember fails to complete a formal course, the formal
school will send a recommendation to the individual‘s gaining unit. The recommendation will
state whether he or she should complete training in-unit, return to the formal school to complete
training, or be referred to the AF personnel system for reassignment.

1.16.1. Progress Review Board (PRB). If a student fails to progress in accordance with the
requirements in this volume, the trainee‘s gaining flying unit Sq/CC will conduct a progress
review. A PRB will be convened to review the trainee‘s records and recommend continuing, re-
training, modify training, or a Flight Evaluation Board (FEB). OG/CC will have final approval
of PRB recommendations. (See AFI 11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical
Ratings and Badges, for FEB and administrative procedures. Note: In certain situations, AFI 11-
402, Chapters 3 and Chapter 4 outline additional information regarding removal from training
short of the FEB process for initial Career Enlisted Aviator‘s (CEA) training.) The ATS
contractor will identify students who fail to progress IAW the applicable ATS contract as
outlined in Chapter 6.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                        23


1.16.1. (305AMW) Units will notify 305 OSS/OST (AFRC: 514 OSS/OST) as soon as possible
when a Progress Review Board (PRB) will be convened due to unsatisfactory training
progression. Use standard memorandum format. PRB guidelines will be maintained by 305
OSS/OST. (AFRC: PRB guidelines will be maintained by 514 OSS/OST).

1.16.1.1. The make-up of the PRB will be at the Sq/CC‘s discretion, but will include, as a
minimum, Sq/CC, OST and OGV representatives, and FTU Chief. For Phase IA review, ATS
will be represented as well.

1.16.2. Supervised Status/Retraining. Each unit will determine their process for documenting
performance that IAW AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 2, KC-10 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria, has
caused a crewmember to be administratively downgraded, failed an evaluation, failed to
demonstrate proficiency once MR, or similar situation which would put a crewmember into a
supervised status. This process will include how and where to document the crewmember‘s
retraining. As a minimum, an AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder, is opened for the
retraining. The crewmember‘s unit should develop a training plan, coordinate training resource
requirement through OSS/OST, then gain Sq/CC approval. The AF Form 4025, Aircrew
Summary/Close-Out Report documenting the completed training will then be given to the unit‘s
Stan/Eval section and the crewmember will be rechecked at the Sq/CC‘s discretion (exercised
through Stan/Eval.).

1.16.2. (305AMW) Supervised Status for Proficiency. Notify 305 OSS/OST (via email
attachment or hardcopy, AFRC: 514 OSS/OST) as soon as possible when individuals are placed
on supervised training status due to failure to demonstrate proficiency in continuation training
events. Use standard memorandum format. Specify the type of events in which the individual
failed to demonstrate proficiency, a detailed plan for removal, and a completion No Later Than
(NLT) date. The individual will fly with an instructor until being removed from supervised
status. The Sq/DO must remove the individual from supervised status by signing the original
Memorandum for Record (MFR) signifying its completion. NOTE: This does not apply to
members placed on supervised status for failure to maintain currency unless they also fail to
maintain proficiency.

1.17. Career Enlisted Aviator Skill Levels. CEAs are not tied to AFI 36-2101, Classifying
Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), and skill level upgrade. All enlisted aircrew
qualifications are separate and distinct from skill level qualification. When AF Form 8,
Certificate of Aircrew Qualification as prescribed in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew
Standardization/Evaluation Program is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, then that
crewmember is qualified to perform all duties assigned to that crew qualification regardless of
skill level. Aircrew instructor and flight examiner qualifications are also separate and distinct
from OJT trainer or certifier designation and are reflected in AFSC by use of "K" prefix (aircrew
instructor) and "Q" prefix (standardization and evaluation flight examiner).

1.18. Aircrew Training Quota Management. The following information describes AMC's
policy and procedures for quota management. This policy was developed from requirements in
AFI 36-2201, Volume 1, Training Development, Delivery, and Evaluation, AFI 36-2107, and
AFI 11-412. This policy is mandatory for all AMC units.

1.18.1. AMC Units: Formal Aircrew Training requirements (except for Simulator Refresher
requirements) will be submitted to the appropriate AMC/A3TF quota manager NLT 30 Sep for
the following fiscal year. AMC/A3TF will consolidate and crosscheck requests with the Pilot
Absorption Management System (PAMS) and submit to Air Staff via the annual Graduate
Program Requirements Document (GPRD) Data Call and finalized at the annual Programmed
Flying Training (PFT) conference.

1.18.1.1. Other MAJCOMS: Submit Formal Aircrew Training requirements to appropriate
MAJCOM Functional Managers NLT 30 SEP for the following fiscal year. The Formal Aircrew
Training requirements (except for Simulator Refresher requirements) will be internally
coordinated by MAJCOM Functional managers and submitted to Air Staff via the annual
Graduate Program Requirements Document (GPRD) Data Call and finalized at the annual
Programmed Flying Training (PFT) conference.

1.18.2. OSS training offices will submit the rank, full name, SSAN, course, and class number to
AMC/A3TF NLT 45 days prior to class start date (CSD). Please ensure that any internal
processes are adjusted to meet this timeline. Training quotas not filled 30 days prior to CSD will
be offered to the next unit on the AMC/A3TF standby list. OSS training offices should
reconfirm all scheduled training with their units at least 10 days prior to CSD to ensure
notification of training, active duty service commitments are established, and orders issued.
Please submit all candidates for training quotas using email only to:
AMC.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil.

1.18.2.1. All course prerequisites will be completed NLT 30 days prior to CSD to allow for
remedial training or substitution. Units will internally identify an alternate candidate for each
allocated quota. If the primary candidate becomes unavailable 30 - 45 days prior to CSD, notify
AMC/A3TF with the alternate's information. If the primary becomes unavailable within 30 days
of CSD, contact your host MPF formal training section to locally substitute the alternate IAW
AMCI 36-2204, AMC Formal Training Program - provide a copy of the local substitution letter
to AMC/A3TF.

1.18.2.2. Foreign exchange officers cannot be locally substituted (they must also be identified
when submitted to load against an allocation), send the replacement's full data to AMC/A3TF.

1.18.3. When submitting local upgrade (secondary method) requests, use the AMC/A3TF web-
site: https://private.AMC.af.mil/a3/a37t/dot/waivers/userlogin.cfm.

1.18.3.1. Forward the following information to the appropriate quota manager: rank, name,
upgrade, course, projected start, projected completion, and a point of contact. Inform via e-mail
when training is complete. If the training being conducted would normally incur an active duty
service commitment (ADSC), insure required counseling and AF Form 63, Active Duty Service
Commitment (ADSC) Acknowledgement Statement is completed prior to start of training.
Contact your local MPF Formal Training office for additional guidance. MILPDS training RIPs
will automatically generate ADSC requirements.

1.18.4. When a training allocation cannot be filled, the OSS training office will notify
AMC/A3TF so the quota may be reallocated. If circumstances prevent an identified candidate
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                       25


from attending the training (e.g., DNIF, unable to complete prerequisite training, etc.), inform
AMC/A3TF immediately. Return all unused quotas to AMC/A3TF NLT 45 days prior to CSD.

1.18.5. All no-shows and late cancellations within 7 days of CSD must be explained. Forward
an initial report of circumstances to AMC/A3TF quota management office within 24 hours of
CSD. This initial notification will be followed by a memorandum of explanation from the
OG/CC to AMC/A3T within one week. E-mail is the preferred method. Send to:
AMC.A3T@scott.af.mil and courtesy copy AMC.quotamanagement@scott.af.mil.

1.18.6. Global Reach Aircraft Commanders Course (GRACC). Active duty units will be given
priority over AFRC and ANG units due to mandatory upgrade requirements for AMC crews
established in AFI 11-2MDS Vol 1. Do not submit more than two candidates per wing per class
without the GRACC scheduler's approval. Submit names NET 45 days and NLT 30 days prior
to CSD. HQ AMC/A3TF will release the class roster 30 days prior to CSD for units to confirm
the names and make any necessary corrections. Unfilled quotas will be available 14 days prior to
CSD and units will be notified. Cancellations must be received NLT four duty days prior to
CSD to avoid a no-show. HQ AMC/A3TF will not accept any additions 72 hours/3 days prior to
CSD. Units can still cancel 24 hours prior to CSD to avoid a no-show being charged to the unit.
Questions regarding GRACC Scheduling can be referred to HQ AMC/A3TF, DSN 779-7881.

1.18.7. AMC/A3TF will maintain a standby list for each course offered. Send requests for
additional quotas to AMC/A3TF for placement on the standby list. If unit capability is in
jeopardy, AMC/A3TF will coordinate with Air Staff and AETC to add or reallocate additional
quotas. AMC/A3TF quota managers will coordinate with the OSS training offices exclusively.
Squadrons or individuals will be referred to their OSS training office. This policy is to ensure
that all offices responsible for quota management are in-synch with each other and prevents lost
seats. Please submit the name/phone number/e-mail for the primary and alternate point of
contact for quota management in the OSS.

1.18.8. AMC units are prohibited from coordinating quota exchanges with other commands.
OSS/OST training offices will forward all requests to the AMC quota manager for coordination
with other commands. Please allow for extended coordination time when considering this
option.

1.18.9. Senior Officer Training coordination. ALL Senior Officer Training is directed by
AF/DPO, AF/DPG offices in coordination with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management office
and AMC/A3TF, and HQ AETC/A3R. Questions regarding Senior Officer training Course,
availability and prerequisites can be forwarded to HQ AMC/A3TF @ DSN 779-3577. No
formal actions to schedule training will be taken until directed by AF/DPO or AF/DPG in
conjunction with MAJCOM Senior Leaders Management offices.

 training is accomplished. Flight Physical expires on the last day of the birth month.
 2. Accomplish SS02 or SS05 if more than 36 months since completion of SS20 or SS32.
 3. LL06 will be accomplished in conjunction with SS02, LL03, or SS05. See Chapter 7.
 4. Crewmembers in MCT are required to complete prior to flying to destinations OCONUS
 5. IAW AFI 11-202 Volume 1, paragraph 6, refer to reference publications which provide
 guidance for accomplishment of ancillary training requirements.
 6. Accomplish within 30 days of initial assignment or PCS per AFI 11-218, Aircraft
 Operations and Movement on the Ground.
 7. Not required for BAQ, BMC crewmembers or Senior Officers.


2.4. Flying Training Requirements. Complete flying training requirements for initial
qualification in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 1 and AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 1, Chapter
3 and Attachment 3. Formal syllabi, when published, will take precedence over guidance in this
AFI.

2.5. Conversion/Differences Qualification Training Requirements. When possible, qualified
personnel in other units will provide the initial cadre. In some instances, it will be necessary for
units to form an initial cadre of aircrew personnel for whom certain training qualification
requirements may be waived. The following conditions will apply to the management of initial
cadre aircrew qualification:

2.5.1. Form a nucleus of instructor and flight examiner personnel (initial cadre) to begin aircrew
conversion/differences training. Converting units may request initial cadre waiver of primary
aircraft inventory (PAI) time requirement. Send waiver request through MAJCOM training staff
in the format in paragraph 1.5.9. Additionally, include the most recent aircraft flown and total
time in that aircraft in the remarks section.

2.5.1.1. Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held, e.g. C-
130 mission pilot (MP) to KC-10 examiner pilot (EP), unless previously qualified at that level in
the conversion aircraft, i.e. prior KC-10 EP.

2.5.1.2. After final approval, publish a unit letter to identify initial cadre of instructors and flight
examiners by crew qualification.

2.6. Multiple Qualifications. Crewmembers will attend a formal initial qualification course for
dual qualification in different MDS aircraft. Crewmembers maintaining dual qualification in
different model aircraft will, as a minimum, maintain FTL A currency requirements in each
aircraft (N/A for senior officers; see paragraph 2.7).

2.7. Senior Officer Qualification Training Requirements. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 (paragraph
2.5) identifies senior officer qualification requirements. Senior Officer Course (SOC) graduates
will be assigned FTL E for continuation training purposes and will not fly unsupervised in a
primary crew position (see paragraph 4.3.2.5).
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                              29


2.7. (305AMW) 305 OSS/OST (AFRC: 514 OSS/OST) will coordinate with HQ AMC/A3T
regarding which senior staff officer course (SOC/SSF) is required and authorized for senior
officers. OST will then coordinate with the contract training facility who will in turn distribute
the course materials to the senior staff officer. The senior staff officer will be assigned to a
squadron that is responsible for providing the necessary publications and equipment required for
the Basic Qualification Course (e.g. Tech Orders, checklists, headset, etc.). The squadron is also
responsible for providing seat fillers and will be contacted by 305 OSS/OST (514 OSS/OST) if
necessary. If a seat-filler is required, an instructor will be selected if available.

2.7.1. After qualification IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and with OG/CC approval, senior
officers (assigned or attached) may seek training which leads to a higher FTL and/or
qualification. The unit OSS/OST office is responsible for determining training requirements
based on the senior officer‘s flying experience and familiarity with the weapons system. HQ
AMC/A3T or appropriate MAJCOM/A3T will approve the proposed training plan prior to
execution.

2.7.2. In order to keep the course length to a minimum, and maximize the students training time,
a suite of CBT lessons must be viewed prior to attendance at the Senior Officer Course. These
CBT lessons can be found at https://www.kc10Ats.com. Contact HQ AMC/A3TK for
assistance (DSN 779-2553).

2.8. Flight Surgeons. Flight surgeons assigned to unit will complete all training requirements
in Table 4.3. for initial qualification. Include flight surgeon testing on AFDL web based
training.

2.9. Requalification Training (RQT). An aircrew member is unqualified upon expiration of
the qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in
Chapter 4), or completion of a qualification evaluation in a different MDS. Exception: When
authorized multiple qualification. The duration of unqualified time is from the date the aircrew
member became unqualified until the specific retraining start date. For Active Duty Service
Commitments for aircrew training, see AFI 36-2107. See AFI 11-202 Volume 1 for additional
requalification training limits and requirements.

2.9. (305AMW) Requalification Training. The OG/CC must approve Squadron Commander-
directed training programs for instructors seeking requalification. Use standard electronic waiver
format IAW AFI 11-2KC-10V1 (WaiverWeb is the primary and preferred method), providing a
brief description of the individual‘s prior qualifications, the date of last qualification, and a brief
description of the duties performed by the individual since qualification was lost. Also provide a
detailed description of the proposed number and type of training events to be accomplished
(including those events to be accomplished from Table 3.2 of the basic instruction) as well as the
required proficiency level for each event. If WaiverWeb is not utilized, it is the responsibility of
the submitting organization to ensure the coordination is achieved in a timely manner and
approval is gained before accomplishing training items.

2.9.1. Individuals requalifying as KC-10 crewmembers will complete in-unit or formal school
training (IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 1) and accomplish those mission certification events from
Table 2.2, Table 3.1, Table 4.1, and Table 4.2 that have expired or are overdue.
30                                         AFI11-2KC-10V1 _305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


2.9.2. Former KC-10 instructors may accomplish instructor requalification concurrent with basic
requalification (in-unit or formal course) for their crew position. For loss of qualification
exceeding 39 months in all cases, all special qualifications and certifications must be re-
accomplished.

2.9.3. Requalification Training Courses. Unqualified crew members will complete the
appropriate TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 (longest to shortest) courses outlined below.

2.9.3.1. Pilot, Flight Engineer, and Boom Operator TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 Courses:

2.9.3.1.1. Unqualified KC-10 crewmembers (over 8 years) will complete the Initial
Qualification (PIQ, ACIQ, FIQ, BBQ) formal school flying training course (TX-1) and a flight
evaluation. An active duty or reserve service commitment is required.

2.9.3.1.2. Unqualified KC-10 crewmembers (greater than 39 months at the end of a non-flying
assignment or 48 months at the end of any active flying assignment to 8 Years) will complete the
Requalification (PRQ, FRQ, BRQ) formal school flying training course (TX-2) as appropriate
and a flight evaluation. An active duty or reserve service commitment is required.

2.9.3.1.3. Unqualified KC-10 crewmembers (up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying
assignment or 48 months at the end of any active flying assignment) will complete a Sq/CC
directed requalification (TX-3) course in-unit and a flight evaluation. Note: The Requalification
formal school flying training courses in 2.9.3.1.2 may be substituted for the in-unit training. An
active duty or reserve service commitment is required if the formal course option is utilized.

2.9.3.1.3.1. Squadron Commanders may tailor or expand the TX-3 course based on individual
proficiency and experience. Unqualified pilots will complete training in all delinquent items,
additional training as directed by the squadron commander, and a flight evaluation. The flying
unit Sq/CC will determine requirements for accomplishment of events from Table 3.2 that are
not continuation training events, e.g. M260, Fighter Deployment Operations.

2.10. Formal Training Unit (FTU) Guidance. The KC-10 Formal Training Units conduct
training at two schoolhouses located at Travis and McGuire AFBs. Specific course information
is located in Attachment 3. Formal syllabi, when published, will take precedence over the
guidance in Attachment 3.

            MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING

3.1. Description. This chapter establishes minimum mission ready criteria and training
requirements to be accomplished during mission certification training (MCT). Except where
specifically stated, squadrons may arrange mission sequence or sequence of items as necessary to
use flying training hours effectively and accomplish the unit mission. All crewmembers will
complete initial qualification (Phase I) and mission qualification (Phase II), but are not
necessarily required to be certified in the unit‘s mission before entering special certification (i.e.
large formation, formation lead, etc.) training. Crewmembers in MCT may participate in
exercises (see paragraph 1.6.2).

3.1.1. Mission certification is the primary certification and must be completed prior to
crewmembers deploying.

3.2. Time Periods for Mission Certification Training. See Table 1.2. During this period
crewmembers will complete remaining requirements from Table 2.1, the ground training
requirements in Table 3.1 and flying training requirements in Table 3.2. Upon successful
completion, and approval by the Sq/CC, Mission Ready (MR) status may be awarded. Aircraft
Commander (AC) and instructor candidates must also be certified through the Review and
Certification (R & C) process IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 2.

3.2.1. Upon completion of all MCT requirements from Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 PCO, ACIQ
and PRQ graduates will be counted as MR pilots for SORTS and TRP purposes and may fly as
an FPQ on any crew, including operational missions. PCO, ACIQ and PRQ graduates are not
MPs and may not fly as pilot-in-command until formally certified by the Sq/CC. See paragraph
5.2 for additional requirements for Mobility Pilot Development (MPD) pilot certification as
aircraft commander.

3.2.2. Crewmembers flying during MCT (who are current and qualified in the aircraft) may fly
without an instructor of like specialty on CONUS-only sorties. See paragraph 3.3.1 for
minimum ground training requirements.

3.3. Ground Training Requirements. All crewmembers will accomplish any remaining events
from Table 2.1 that were not previously accomplished while at the FTU and the applicable
events from Table 3.1. Complete all academic ground training events required for mission
certification in the unit operational mission (not applicable for senior officers or staff officers
maintaining BAQ). Training may be accomplished concurrently with other training.

3.3.1. Local training and CONUS missions may be flown before completing all events, provided
Aircraft Marshalling Exam (G002), Flight Physical, Physiological Training, Aircrew Flight
Equipment Familiarization (LL01), Egress Training (LL03) and Local Area Survival (SS01) are
accomplished.

3.3.2. Graduates of the formal Pilot Check Out Course need only accomplish ground training
events in which they have lost currency.

3.3.3. If required, complete formal course training events not accomplished at formal school.

3.3.4. The ATS contractor post-graduate questionnaire will be completed by the student prior to
the individual being declared mission ready.

3.3.5. Certified or qualified MR crewmembers transferring between units will require a Flight
Medicine clearance from the gaining base, Aircraft Ground Marshaling Training and
Examination (G002), ISOPREP Review (G120), Local Area Survival (SS01), and unit-specific
MR training events (and events in which they may have lost currency during the change-of-
station). See paragraph 3.4.2 for additional information.

3.3.6. Ground training events accomplished during MCT establish the crewmembers due dates
for subsequent continuation training. Completion of SS20, SS32, and initial Aircrew Flight
Equipment Familiarization (during formal school) establishes the due date (based on date of first
completed course) for recurring SS02, SS03, SS05, and LL06. Completion of SS20 also
establishes the due date for recurring G100.

3.4. Flying Training Requirements:

3.4.1. Complete the requirements in Table 3.2. Items accomplished to the appropriate
proficiency level during FTU count toward this mission ready table. Upon completion of MCT,
the Sq/CC will adjust the crewmember‘s training levels as appropriate and therefore prorate
continuation training requirements based on the date MR was gained (see Table 4.7, Individual
Availability).

3.4.2. After arrival at the duty station following a PCS from the other KC-10 main operating
base (MOB), crewmembers will receive a local area briefing and supervised local orientation
flight. The lack of a local briefing and local flight does not preclude the crewmember from
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                     33


deploying as MR.      Crewmember must accomplish all grounding items prior to the local
orientation flight.

3.4.3. MPD Pilots selected for in-unit aircraft commander certification training must re-
accomplish all applicable events in Table 3.2, except for F020, N013, N014, P260, P270, P280,

3.5. Mission Certification Training (Phase II). Flight training will be conducted by KC-10
instructors. See also paragraph 5.6 Special Qualifications and Certifications. Crewmembers
will be mission ready (MR) after completion of all ground training, mobility training, flying
training requirements, and certification (if required).

3.5.1. MPD Pilots (Graduates of KC-10 Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ):

3.5.1.1. Place emphasis on pilot duties and responsibilities, and the ability to provide sound back
up to an Aircraft Commander. By exception, prior to achieving MR status, MPD pilots may fly
in the left seat during critical phases of flight 1) unrestricted with an IP in the right seat or 2) on a
local sortie only with an MP in the right seat if that MP has at least 150 hours since AC
Certification. This does not prevent two FPs in MCT from occupying both seats during non-
critical phases of flight if under IP supervision.

3.5.2. Graduates of KC-10 Aircraft Commander Initial Qualification (ACIQ) and Pilot Check
Out Course (PCO).

3.5.2.1. ACIQ and PCO pilots‘ training should place emphasis on Aircraft Commander duties
and the ability to lead a crew throughout the mobility system. When training is completed, the
individual will be certified by the Sq/CC as an Aircraft Commander.

3.5.3. Graduates of KC-10 FBP/FIQ: The object of Phase II training for FBPs is to provide
graduated exposure to the duties of a KC-10 flight engineer prior to MF certification. There are
two parts to this training – Phase IIA & IIB.

3.5.3.1. Phase IIA: Begins after the Phase IB evaluation and ends when the requirements in this
chapter are complete. FBPs need only to be signed off to the Satisfactory level in M261 and
M262 before being moved into Phase IIB, however, they must be observed proficient before
completing Phase IIB. May fly local training sorties under IF supervision–log FF time.

3.5.3.2. Phase IIB (FBP track engineers only). For FBP Engineers, begins at the conclusion of
Phase IIA and is complete when the requirements below have been met. During this period the
FBP may fly as an FF on local training sorties unsupervised and log FF time. Also, they may fill
the second engineer requirement for augmentation, as outlined in AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 3,
KC-10 Operations Procedures, for cargo missions only, provided the other engineer is an IF.

3.5.3.2.1. An additional M261 and M262 must be completed and documented IAW Attachment
2.

3.5.3.2.2. The FBP/FF must have 150 hours of flight time after the Phase IB evaluation to
achieve MF status. This requirement may be waived by the OG/CC on a case-by-case basis.

3.5.4. Graduates of KC-10 FIQ: May fly unsupervised on local sorties and will log FF time.

3.5.5. Graduates of KC-10 BBQ: The object of Phase II training for BBQs is to provide initial
cargo load training to prepare KC-10 Boom Operators for their initial MSN (Cargo) evaluations.
There is one part to this training – Phase II.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                      35


3.5.5.1. Phase II: Begins after the Phase IB evaluation and ends when the requirements of this
chapter are complete. May fly local training sorties unsupervised and log FB time. Q022 and
Q023 should be completed during this phase if not accomplished during Phase IB. Booms will
not be scheduled to refuel fighter type aircraft without an instructor until completion of Q022
and Q023 certification and documentation. The BBQ may be certified an MB at the completion
of Phase II.

                                            Chapter 4

                                CONTINUATION TRAINING

4.1. Description. This chapter establishes the minimum flying and related ground training
requirements to maintain currency and qualification. The unit commander will ensure
crewmembers receive sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency.

4.2. Aircrew Status. KC-10 crewmembers are assigned to MR, BMC, or BAQ status.

4.2.1. Mission Ready (MR). For Status of Resources and Training Systems (SORTS),
operational tasking, and deployments, a MR crewmember is defined as one who is available and
certified in the squadron‘s mission (completed qualification and mission certification training for
applicable crew position).

4.2.2. Non-Mission Ready (NMR). A crewmember that is unqualified, non-current or
incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission. See
paragraph 4.9 for specific guidance on crewmembers who are non-current or incomplete in
required continuation training.

4.2.3. Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A non-mission ready (NMR) crewmember assigned to
MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, 618 TACC, USAF Expeditionary Center, Contingency Response
Wing (CRW), or Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) who has satisfactorily completed mission
certification training and does not maintain MR status, but maintains familiarization in the
command or unit‘s operational mission

4.2.3.1. The crewmember may maintain qualification in some aspects of the unit mission and is
able to attain full qualification in the unit mission within 45 days.

4.2.3.2. BMC crewmembers may log instructor or examiner time for the portion of the mission
for which they are current and qualified and performing instructor or examiner duties.
Otherwise, they will log FP, FF or FB time.

4.2.4. Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ). A crewmember that has satisfactorily completed
initial qualification training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft.

4.2.5. MR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers must accomplish and/or maintain the requirements in
AFI 11-202, Volume 1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the ground and
semi-annual flying continuation tables in Chapter 4.

4.3. Training Levels.

4.3.1. The Sq/CC assigns crewmember training levels (TL) (see paragraph 1.4.6.2). NMR
crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM headquarters, NAF, 618 TACC, USAF Expeditionary
Center, CRW, or a DRU are normally categorized as BMC and assigned FTL A or E. In
addition, individuals assigned to FTL A must also accomplish annual CRM and refresher
simulator training requirements. These individuals may fly unsupervised on CONUS training
missions provided they are current and qualified.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                        37


4.3.2. Flying Training Levels (FTL).

4.3.2.1. FTL A–Highly Experienced Crewmembers. (As a guide, crewmembers having 10 or
more years of operational flying experience) This may include MR or NMR MAJCOM
headquarters staff and 618 TACC personnel; FTU instructors; NAF personnel; USAFEC
instructors, WG/CC, OG/CC, and Sq/CC, operations officers, crewmembers assigned to OG
evaluation positions, and instructors assigned primarily to staff duties. Sq/CC may assign highly
experienced MR line crewmembers to FTL A.

4.3.2.2. FTL B–Experienced MR Crewmember. As a guide, crewmembers having between 5-10
years of operational flying experience.

4.3.2.3. FTL C–Crewmember or BAQ Crewmember pursuing MR status after initial
qualification training. As a guide, crewmembers having less than 5 years of operational flying
experience. Initially assign inexperienced MR crewmembers to FTL C.

4.3.2.4. FTL D–No longer used.

4.3.2.5. FTL E–BAQ or BMC non-instructor staff. This training level may include senior
officers, MAJCOM, NAF, 618 TACC, CRW, and DRU staff who are not maintaining MR or
instructor status. FTL E requirements are insufficient for MR status and crewmembers assigned
to this FTL will fly with an instructor of like specialty at all times.

4.3.3. Ground Training Levels (GTL). Operational flying includes all MAF aircraft flight
training where the aviator receives periodic continuation training. Separate levels are no longer
utilized. All crewmembers will follow the frequency listed for their crew position in Table 4.1.
See notes for when exceptions apply.

4.3.4. Change of FTL. Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a crewmember to a
level requiring fewer events. Exception: Units associating FTLs with crew positions may
change FTLs after upgrade i.e. instructor upgrade. BAQ crewmembers may be placed into a
different FTL any time after attaining MR status. Prorate events upon changing training levels.

4.4. Training Events/Tables. Standardized ARMS training event identifiers and descriptions
can be found in Chapter 7. Unit defined events will be designated ―X‖ events (i.e. X020) and
listed in local supplement. Proration of training information can be found in Table 4.6 and
paragraph 4.8 of this AFI.

4.4. (305AMW) Training Events/Tables. Local ―X‖ events are developed in addition to those
training events listed in AFI 11-2KC-10V1, Chapter 7. Local ―X‖ events fulfill specific
requirements providing commanders a greater level of detail regarding the readiness of their
crew force. Local ―X‖ events may be created or deleted as desired through written coordination
with 305 OSS/OST. 514 AMW will coordinate updates with 514 OSS/OST prior to 305
OSS/OST. NOTE: Due to the constant changes in Local ―X‖ events, a current and
comprehensive list will be maintained by 305 OSS/OST (AFRC: 514 OSS/OST).

4.4.1. Crediting Event Accomplishment. Credit events accomplished on training, operational
missions and satisfactory evaluations toward currency requirements and establish a subsequent
38                                         AFI11-2KC-10V1 _305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


due date. Use date of evaluation as the date of accomplishment for all flying training currency
events that were trained during the formal course. Note: Events that are accomplished during
upgrade training, for which an upgrade student is currently qualified, may be credited towards
the requirements for the current crew position.

4.4.2. Do not log continuation training events graded Q-3 (according to AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume
2) on a flight evaluation, until re-qualified.

4.4.3. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period. For
G220, flight engineers must accomplish systems refresher material for the missed quarter.

4.4.4. Instructors and flight examiners may credit 50 percent of their total training requirements
while instructing or evaluating. Exception: Instructor and Flight Examiner pilots may not credit
any takeoffs, landings, or receiver air-to-air refueling (rendezvous may be credited) flown by
another pilot. Instructor and examiner boom operators must accomplish all their own contacts.

4.4.5. Records and Documentation. Units will use AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training
Accomplishment Report prescribed by AFI 11-202, Volume 1, to record training
accomplishments. Course instructors will deliver these forms to the appropriate scheduling and
training documentation sections within one duty day after the class is taught. Combat arms
training (G280) will be recorded on AF Form 522, USAF Ground Weapons Training Data IAW
AFI 36-2226, Combat Arms Program.

4.5. Continuation Training Requirements.

4.5.1. Ground Training Events. Completion and tracking of continuation training is the
responsibility of the individual crewmember. Crewmembers shall actively work with unit
schedulers and training offices to ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described
in this chapter.

4.5.1.1(305AMW). Crewmembers will coordinate any applicable ground training through their
Aircraft Commander (or C2 agency if away from home station) or squadron scheduler/unit chain
of command when not assigned to an aircrew.

4.5.2. Ground Training Events. Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Table 4.1,
Table 4.2, and Table 4.3.

4.5.2.1. Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 leads to non-mission ready status. See
paragraph 4.9 for regaining mission ready status.

4.5.2.2. Failure to complete mobility training requirements in Table 4.2 does not lead to non-
mission ready status but may restrict member from certain missions requiring the associated
training. Staff crewmembers (i.e. MAJCOM, NAF, 618 TACC, USAF EC, etc.) may
accomplish ground training events at locations other than their unit of attachment. The
crewmember is responsible for reporting accomplished training events to their unit of attachment
(ARMS office).

4.5.2.3. Ancillary Training. See paragraph 4.7.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                          39


4.5.2.4. Crewmembers performing extended alert duty (more than 72-hours) may accomplish
ground training that does not degrade required response time or mission accomplishment.
Specify requirements and or restriction in MAJCOM supplement and local supplement.

4.5.2.5. Flight Surgeons use requirements in Table 4.3.

4.5.2.6. All training events will be recorded in ARMS.

4.5.2.6.1. Training events conducted during block training or phase training may be consolidated
under one ARMS entry.

4.5.2.6.2. Combined training events may have only one ARMS entry.

4.5.2.6.3. Input all one-time events and events required for Permanent Change-of-Station (PCS)
in the ARMS database. Do not maintain these events on the crewmembers' currency reports.

10. Frequency is semi-annual for MAJCOM, NAF, and AFMC Boom Operators.


4.6. Flight Surgeon Continuation Flying Requirements. Flight Surgeons will comply with
the requirements of this volume and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. Flight surgeons require one sortie
in any qualified MDS every 60 days. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1 table for flying continuation
training requirements. See Table 4.3 for flight surgeon ground continuation training
requirements.

4.6.1. Flight Surgeon loss of flying currency. Units will notify the MAJCOM Command
Surgeon of non-current Flight Surgeons (AMC units send notification to HQ AMC/SGP).

4.6.1.1. Flight Surgeons that exceed 60 days between sorties (but less than 180 days) require
completion of emergency egress training (non-ejection) with a certified aircrew instructor prior
to the next flight.

4.6.1.2. Flight Surgeons that exceed 180 days between sorties require completion of emergency
egress training (non-ejection) with a certified aircrew instructor prior to the next flight,
completion of the online Flight Surgeon Qualification Exam (https://afiadl.mont.disa.mil), and
compliance with local qualification guidance.

4.7. Ancillary Training. Guidance or instruction that contributes to mission accomplishment,
but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 1 is
48                                          AFI11-2KC-10V1 _305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


not the governing directive for completion of ancillary training events. In accordance with AFI
11-202 Volume 1, the source AFI provides training frequency for these events unless an
approved waiver has been authorized. See Unit Deployment Manger representative to ensure
compliance with additional non-aircrew specific training requirements.

4.8. Proration of Training. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 describes proration of training requirements
for crewmembers not available for flying duties. Prorate crewmembers when first attaining MR
status (see Para 3.4.1 for more information). In addition, prorate training for non-availability due
to contingency alerts and contingency flying TDYs when the contingency precludes training for
certain mission events. This authority must be used judiciously, especially when prorating the
same crewmember for consecutive semi-annual training periods.

4.8.1. Use this formula to determine training requirements: number of months available times
the event volume divided by the number of months in the training period. Round down to the
nearest whole number (e.g. 5.6 rounds to 5), but not less than 1 unless the individual was
available for less than 15 days during the SA period.

4.8.1.1. Use Table 4.6 to determine the number of months available. Prorate only if absence is
at least 15 cumulative days. For contingency alerts and contingency flying TDYs non-
consecutive periods of non-availability can be combined for proration purposes.

4.8.1.2. When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) during the training cycle to a
unit flying the same model aircraft and enters the same FTL or lower, credit training
accomplished at the previous base. Prorate training requirements based on the time available
(e.g., time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not available) during the
training period. Time available starts 7-days after sign-in for CONUS and 14-days after sign-in
for OCONUS or on the date of actual accomplishment of the first training event, whichever
occurs first. Subtract previous accomplishments from the prorated total to determine remaining
requirements.

4.8.2. Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels.              If
requirements are prorated do not credit events accomplished while in the former FTL.

4.9. Failure to Complete Training Requirements. Declare individuals NMR if they fail to
maintain flying currency, fail to complete semi-annual flying continuation training requirements
or ground continuation training requirements. The following guidance applies:

4.9.1. Flight Training Currency. Flight currency is associated with those events denoted in the
flying continuation training tables by a specific period of time (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual,
or annually) within which an event must be accomplished. A currency event must be
accomplished at least once within that specified time in order to maintain the currency.

4.9.1.1. Loss of Currency. Place individuals in one or more currency events in supervised
training status for that event and declare them NMR in those unit missions requiring that event.
Crewmembers are ―non-current‖ the day after event currency expires (i.e. a crewmember, who
accomplished a monthly currency event on 5 September, becomes non-current on 1 November).

4.9.1.1.1. For all non-current events, place individuals in supervised training status for that event
and declare them NMR in unit missions requiring the event. The crewmember cannot deploy
and may not fly unsupervised OCONUS until currency is regained. Loss of currency prohibits
an individual from accomplishing unsupervised in-flight duties in the non-current event(s).
EXAMPLE: If the individual is non-current for tanker air refueling, the individual may fly
unsupervised on CONUS sorties which are not scheduled for and do not accomplish tanker air
refueling.

4.9.1.1.1. (305AMW) Notify 305 OSS/OST or 514 OSS/OST (via email attachment or hardcopy)
as soon as possible when individuals are placed in supervised training status due to failure to
complete required continuation training events or to maintain currency. Use standard
memorandum format. Specify the number and type of events that were not accomplished and
describe the training required to regain mission-ready (MR) status or indicate whether a waiver
will be pursued for the event(s). Specify the No Later Than (NLT) date that the member is
expected to be removed from supervised status. A second memorandum is only required if the
member is not removed from supervised status in the allotted time frame, otherwise the
individual is expected to be MR upon reaching the NLT date specified on the original MFR.
NOTE: See Attachment 5 for an example MFR. This example MFR is also posted on the 305
OSS/OST SharePoint website (AFRC: 514 OSS/OST SharePoint website).

4.9.1.1.2. A Pilot non-current in Takeoff (P010 or P020), Landings (P190), or Approaches
(P070), will not fly unsupervised on any sortie.

4.9.1.2. Regaining Currency.

4.9.1.2.1. Loss of Currency up to 6-Months. Crewmembers maintain their current training level
and no training folder is required. Crewmember must demonstrate proficiency in the aircraft or
WST (as appropriate) in all delinquent items while under supervision of an instructor.

4.9.1.2.2. Loss of Currency exceeding 6-Months. Crewmember is declared Unqualified for a
loss of currency of events in Table 4.4 and Table 4.5. The crewmember will complete Sq/ CC
directed requalification training (and evaluation, if required) according to AFI 11-2KC-10
Volume 2.
50                                         AFI11-2KC-10V1 _305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


4.9.2. Failure to Complete Semi-annual Flying Training Events.

4.9.2.1. The Sq/CC will review ARMS products at the end of each semi-annual training period.
For individuals who fail to accomplish training requirements, the Sq/CC will either declare them
NMR or request an OG/CC Waiver for the requirement (paragraph 1.5.8). If OG/CC waiver is
not sought, SQ/CC will direct re-training required to regain MR status.

4.9.2.1.1. Place individuals who are NMR for failure to complete semi-annual flying training
events in supervised status for that event (crewmember flies with an instructor of like specialty)
until SQ/CC directed re-training is accomplished. The crewmember cannot deploy or fly
unsupervised until currency is regained.

4.9.2.2. Waivers for Flight Training Events. The Sq/CC will send waiver requests for Failure-
to-complete and Loss-of-Currency to the OG/CC for endorsement.

4.9.3. Ground Training Events.

4.9.3.1. Failure to Complete. Individuals who fail to complete ground training requirements are
declared NMR. The crewmember cannot deploy or fly unsupervised until currency is regained
(Exception: Noncurrent crewmembers may fly unsupervised on local, routine, and CONUS
missions according to Table 4.1 on sorties not requiring the ground training event.).

4.9.3.1.1. An individual NMR for failure to complete Hazardous Cargo Training (G182) may fly
unsupervised on local training missions only with Sq/CC approval until training is completed.

4.9.3.2. Waivers for Ground Training Events. The OG/CC or equivalent may waive ground
continuation training events identified in Table 4.1, Table 4.2 and Table 4.3. The decision to
grant a waiver will be based on the individual crewmember‘s experience and proficiency level
(i.e. waivers will not be based on a crewmember‘s availability). OG/CC will determine the
allowable time period of the waiver. The make-up training should be accomplished at the
earliest opportunity. This waiver is for unforeseen circumstances only and only for events that
will not degrade mission accomplishment.

4.9.4. Make-up training (ground or flying) is creditable towards the new training period.

4.10. Requirements Before PCS Or TDY By Members On Active Flying Status. See AFI
11-202, Volume 1.

4.11. Requirements Before Removal From Active Flying. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1.

4.12. Requirements While In Inactive Flying Status. See AFI 11-202, Volume 1.

4.13. Retraining. AFI 11-202, Volume 1 specifies retraining restrictions before separation,
retirement, or mandatory inactive flying status.

                                    UPGRADE TRAINING

5.1. Description. This chapter identifies general prerequisites and training requirements for
upgrade. HQ AMC/A3TK is developing course syllabi for the Phase IB FTU courses containing
applicable ground and flying requirements. If available, the syllabus will take precedence over
guidance published in this volume. AETC maintains a list of formal school courses at the
Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) website. The site address is:
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/.

5.1.1. OG/CC is designated waiver authority for minimum prerequisites for entry into upgrade
programs.

NOTES:
1. The flying time prerequisites for upgrade are based on the pilot having gained the
knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish the unit‘s missions. Squadron
commanders must ensure their continuation training programs emphasize these areas.
2. GRACC, if required (see paragraph 5.3.2).
3. Prior ACs/FAIPs will have a minimum of 100 KC-10 PAA hours (does not include other
time or Phase I time) prior to certification as aircraft commander.


5.2. Mobility Pilot Development (MPD). Mobility Pilot Development is the development
program for graduates of Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT) leading to aircraft
commander certification. The MPD program is broken into three phases: initial training in the
Pilot Initial Qualification (PIQ) formal training course, continuation training (to include FTDs
and WSTs) and the Pilot Check Out (PCO) course. All MPD pilots will be dual-seat qualified
and maintain qualification requirements according to AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 2. MPD pilots
are not Aircraft Commanders but should be considered in continuous aircraft commander
training upon graduation from the FTU until their AC certification. See minimum flying hour
requirements in Table 5.1

5.2.1. Following PIQ, upgrade training to Aircraft Commander should take, but is not limited to,
approximately two years. The success of the program depends on MPD pilots being mentored
and provided with opportunities to accomplish duties in both the left and right seats in
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                           53


preparation for PCO. The training timeline to upgrade to aircraft commander is based on
performance, and at the discretion of the Sq/CC, should be tailored to match an individual‘s
capabilities and experience level.

5.2.1.1. Refer to Attachment 3 for formal training events and requirements. Once a formal
training syllabus is published, the formal syllabus will take precedence over guidance published
in this volume.

5.2.1.2. MPD Documentation. Document all MPD pilot training IAW Attachment 2 and
paragraph 5.2.1.3.1, beginning with PIQ until completion of MCT.

5.2.1.2.1. An MPD pilot training folder will be opened upon the MPD pilot‘s arrival at the unit
and will remain open until the MPD pilot has completed Phase II. A second training folder will
be opened upon SQ/CC selection for upgrade until certified as an aircraft commander (electronic
versions are authorized and encouraged). Training programs may be combined in a single
training folder at the unit‘s discretion.

5.2.1.2.2. While not required for every sortie, AF Forms 4023 should be completed regularly to
document training progress. Unit instructor pilots will include strengths, weaknesses, and
recommendations for improvement and upgrade in the comments. Instructor Pilots are
responsible for providing training documentation and recommendations after all periods of
instruction.   Aircraft Commanders are responsible for providing documentation and
recommendations after off-station operational missions.

5.2.2. Continuation Training for MPD:

5.2.2.1. After completion of Phase II, MPD pilots continue to mature, and develop the
airmanship required of an aircraft commander, through local sorties and operational missions and
deployments. After MR and during Continuation Training, he/she may fly unrestricted with an
MP or above. Good judgment and Operational Risk Management (ORM) mitigation will dictate
with whom they fly and what seat they occupy. Commanders should take every opportunity to
season pilots by allowing them to fly in both seats as applicable with an instructor or experienced
aircraft commander. While not required for every sortie, AF Forms 4023 should be completed
regularly to document training progress.

5.2.2.2. WST missions will play an important role in terms of building aircraft systems and
procedural knowledge to the level expected of an aircraft commander. Squadron leadership must
ensure pilots get a good balance of left and right seat activity. Time spent in the left seat during
quarterly refreshers will build upon the training these pilots received during initial qualification
and prepare them for the responsibility ahead.

5.2.3. Receiver A/R training for MPD pilots may be accomplished anytime with an IP (as long
as passengers are not on-board). MPD pilots may be entered into a certification program IAW
AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 1, paragraph 5.6.9 MPD pilots should be certified in Q583, MPD
Receiver Air-to-Air Refueling, prior to entering PCO. This refueling may be accomplished in
either seat.

5.2.4. GRACC Completion. See paragraph 5.3.2 for description and requirements.
54                                         AFI11-2KC-10V1 _305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


5.2.5. Aircrew Designation Codes.        AFI 11-401 defines pilot aviation codes.              For
standardization, use the codes from Table 5.2 (3rd letter designator distinguishes the status for a
MPD pilot who completed formal training with evaluation (graduate). During Phase IB training,
pilots will log ―UP‖ time.).

Table 5.2. Mobility Pilot Designation Codes.
If ―UP‖        Unqualified Pilot.
               Unqualified Non-Mission Ready (NMR). This code is used for:

If ―EP‖
              on the mission.
5.3. Aircraft Commander (AC). See minimum flying hour requirements in Table 5.1.

5.3.1. General. The flying time prerequisites for upgrade are based on the pilot having gained
the knowledge and judgment required to effectively accomplish the unit‘s missions. Squadron
commanders must ensure their continuation training programs emphasize these areas.
Commanders should take every opportunity to season pilots by allowing them to fly in the left
seat with an instructor or experienced aircraft commander.

5.3.1.1. The preferred method for completing Aircraft Commander upgrade training is by
completion of the Pilot Check Out (PCO) Course conducted by the contractor followed by
flightline training conducted by the Formal Training Unit (FTU). Contractor training covers
emergency procedures, tactics, and Aircraft Commander duties. FTU training completes air-to-
air refueling training. Units retain the option to conduct in-unit Aircraft Commander upgrades
without waiver for highly qualified and experienced pilots.

5.3.1.2. In-Unit Aircraft Commander Certification. After being identified by the Sq/CC for
upgrade, in addition to GRACC requirements explained in paragraph 5.3.2, pilots must
accomplish events listed in Table 3.2 and be recommended for certification by an instructor
pilot. Note: A minimum of two missions in the AMC en route system (OCONUS preferred)
should be accomplished. Prior to certification the upgrade candidate must demonstrate aircraft
commander proficiency during an Aircraft Commander Flight Evaluation, to include receiver air-
to-air refueling, IAW AFI 11-2KC-10, Volume 2.

5.3.1.2. (305AMW) Pilots – In-Unit Aircraft Commander (AC) Certification. The OG/CC
must approve Squadron Commander-directed training programs for Pilots seeking in-unit
Aircraft Commander Upgrade. Use standard electronic waiver format IAW 11-2KC-10V1,
Figure 1.1, providing a brief description of the individual‘s prior qualifications and experience.
Also provide a detailed description of the proposed number and type of training events to be
accomplished (including those events to be accomplished from Table 3.2 of the basic
instruction) as well as the required proficiency level for each event. NOTE: WaiverWeb is the
primary and preferred method to approve all in-house upgrades, requalifications (requals), and
SQ/CC-directed training programs regardless if a waiver is required

5.3.1.3. Aircraft Commander Certification. Required for ACIQ, PRQ, PCO graduates, and in-
unit upgrades and is governed by training timelines for Mission Certification Training in
Chapter 3 of this instruction. A crewmember will be mission ready (MR) after completion of
all ground training and flying training requirements. Additionally, Aircraft Commanders must
be certified by the Sq/CC or Review and Certification (R & C) Board before performing duties
as Pilot in Command (PIC).

5.3.2. Global Ready Aircraft Commander Course (GRACC). GRACC is a three-phase process
designed to familiarize pilots with all aspects of operating in the en route system. The three
phases are divided as follows: Pilot to Aircraft Commander Phase I (V280), Pilot to Aircraft
56                                             AFI11-2KC-10V1 _305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


Commander Phase II (V281), and HQ AMC Orientation Tour (V282). See Chapter 7 for course
description.

5.3.2.1. Applicability. GRACC training is required for AMC pilots upgrading to aircraft
commander and highly encouraged for AMC-gained ARC pilots. Due to limited slots, AMC-
gained ARC OG/CCs will determine attendance requirements for their pilots. A one-time
course, completion is transferable between all mobility weapon systems. Waiver authority is
OG/CC or equivalent.

5.3.2.2. Documentation. Completion of each phase of GRACC is documented in ARMS (V280,
V281, and V282). Document the completion of the entire course via the AF Form 4324 as
―GRACC‖ using ARMS event identifier Q280.

5.3.2.3. Training Guides. GRACC workbooks are available for download on the AMC/A3T
CoP. Workbooks should be carried on all sorties to maximize training opportunities. Additional
information     on    GRACC       can     be      located   on      the    ETCA      website,
https://etca.randolph.af.mil/showcourse.asp?as_course_id=GRACC.

5.3.2.4. Phase I. Pilot To Aircraft Commander Phase I (V280). This phase consists of
completing the V280 generic MAF workbook. MPD Pilots will complete the V280 workbook
NLT 180 days after becoming mission ready. The workbook will help new pilots become
familiar with moving a mission within the Mobility Enroute System and other associated
requirements. For non-AMC unit or FAIP/OSA pilots transitioning to MAF aircraft, V280 will
not be accomplished; however V281 and V282 are still required.

5.3.2.5. Phase II. Pilot To Aircraft Commander Phase II (V281). The second phase consists of
completing a second MDS-specific workbook. V281 will serve to review all the objectives in
Phase I (V280) with more MDS specific topics. Pilots will complete V281 before Phase III
(V282) and starting their formal aircraft commander upgrade & certification course. Aircraft
Commander candidates who have transferred from non-AMC units or FAIP/OSA assignments
will complete V281 and V282 before AC certification during an R & C board. MAJCOMs may
substitute an alternate aircraft-specific Training Guide for the Phase II Training Guide.

5.3.2.6. Phase III. HQ AMC Orientation Tour Phase III (V282). The third phase visits HQ
AMC and the 618 TACC. This event provides an in-depth look at selected 618 TACC and AMC
operations as well as an opportunity to interact with command senior staff. Ideally, this course
should be completed by aircraft commander candidates after completing Phase II, but before
attending formal aircraft commander upgrade training. V282 will be completed prior to AC
certification.

maintaining a stable contact position for a minimum of 5 minutes, and returning to the pre-
contact position. If the pilot demonstrates proficiency in right seat air refueling during FTU/in-
unit upgrade training, that student may be certified for right seat air refueling upon successful
completion of their initial Aircraft Commander and AR Evaluation (there is no need to evaluate
AR from both seats during the evaluation).

5.6.10.4. (Added)(305AMW) Certification. Aircraft Commanders may be certified after the
above training is complete and official Aircraft Commander certification has been achieved. If
an Aircraft Commander completes all certification training during Phase IB to a safe and
proficient level, the individual may be certified following a successful AR evaluation provided
that it is specifically documented on the final AF IMT 4025. Document training in accordance
with paragraph 5.6 of this supplement. NOTE: The monthly receiver AR currency can be
maintained from either seat after an individual is certified to accomplish right seat receiver AR.

5.6.11. Large Formation Certification (Q580):

5.6.11.1. The squadron commander is responsible for developing a large formation certification
training program for all pilots. This certification must include a minimum of one flight flown
under supervision of an instructor pilot. If instructor manning prevents placing IPs in all aircraft
units may place an IP in one aircraft in the formation. The optimum is the last aircraft so that the
IP may monitor all aircraft of the formation. Commanders of deployed units or tanker task force
(TTF) commanders may certify TDY crew members and will forward certification paperwork to
the crew member‘s home unit for filing in the member‘s training folders. Requires pre-
coordination with all formation participants and associated AAR support. Aircraft Commanders
that were previously certified as pilots/copilots are not required to be re-certified.
Accomplishment during Phase IB is only creditable towards certification if specifically
documented on the AF Form 4025. Document the certification via AF Form 4324. ARMS event
identifier is Q580, Large Formation Certification.

5.6.11.2. (Added)(305AMW) Eligibility. ACIQ, FPN/Ls, PCOs, and MPs.

5.6.11.3. (Added)(305AMW) Training Requirements. The pilot will receive a briefing on
each of the following from an IP: takeoff intervals, departure and join-up procedures (VMC vs.
IMC), radar techniques, mixed formations, and lost wingman procedures. Pilots will also
accomplish a minimum of one large formation departure under IP supervision. This training
may be accomplished in conjunction with Formation Lead certification training. Any position in
the formation is creditable. Accomplish training IAW AFI 11-2KC-10V1 paragraph 5.6.11.

5.6.11.4. (Added)(305AMW) Certification. Aircraft Commanders and pilots may be certified
after the above training is complete. Aircraft Commanders that were previously certified as
pilots/MPDs are not required to be re-certified nor do they need to re-complete the training. If
all required training is accomplished in Phase IB to a safe and proficient level, the individual
may be certified following a successful completion of their initial evaluation provided it is
documented on the AF Form 4025. Document training in accordance with paragraph 5.6 of this
supplement. NOTE: Pilots are not required to accomplish formation on their evaluation in order
to receive certification credit provided that the training accomplished during Phase IB is
documented properly.

                           AIRCREW TRAINING SYSTEM (ATS)

6.1. Description. The KC-10 ATS is a civilian contractor-provided aircrew training system.
The ATS contractor provides academic and simulator training. The Air Force conducts all flight
training and administers all evaluations. The ATS contract guarantees trained students meet
government standards. Formal ATS courses are listed in Table 6.2 and non-formal ATS courses
are listed in Table 6.3.

6.2. Applicability. As defined in AFI 11-202, Volume 1.

6.2.1. Purpose. KC-10 ATS is a system of academics, ATD sessions, and ground training
phases. This system provides qualification, requalification, upgrade, senior staff, differences,
and continuation training to attain and maintain appropriate qualification for KC-10
crewmembers and maintenance engine run technicians. The ATS contractor provides training
courseware and all academic and ATD instruction. US Air Force provides all flight instruction.

6.2.2. Goal. The goal of the ATS program is to optimize aircrew training through the integrated
use of academics, ATD, and flight line KC-10 aircraft instruction. The KC-10 ATS, by contract,
establishes performance requirements in the ATS Statement of Work (SOW) and system
specification.

6.2.3. Responsibilities:

6.2.3.1. ATS Contractor.

NOTES:
1. For Instructor Courses that include the three-day Academic Instructor Course (AIC)
portion; If the student is a previously qualified instructor they need not accomplish this
training and will start three days later.
2. KC-10 FRQ requires pilot class KC-10 PRQ to be scheduled at the same time.
3. See paragraph 2.7 for additional requirements.
4. There are two tracks available for instructor upgrade. Track I is for students that have
never been Air Force flight instructors (the longer course that includes extra academics) and
Track II is for all others.
5. While planned for one student, this course can accommodate two students by doubling
the number of BOT periods required.
6. Squadron to which the Senior Officer is attached will provide an appropriate pilot ‗seat
filler‘ to complement their SOC student.
7. Course is designed for one ACIQ, one PIQ and one FIQ student or two PIQ students and
one FIQ student.

NOTES:
1. These courses are archived for future reference/use and are not updated nor maintained by
the ATS contractor. They can be updated for use following HQ AMC/A3TK notification to the
contractor.
2. This training is Computer Based training.
3. CRM training is developed in accordance with AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource
Management Training Program. Training is included in the requisite Initial Qual, Instructor
Qual, and Refresher courses.
4. Course designed to teach KC-10 qualified instructors and evaluators to operate devices
(WST and FTDs for IPs/IFEs, BOT for IBOs).


6.5. Lesson Objectives. Contractor-developed lesson objectives are based on requirements in
this instruction.

6.5.1. The training contractor will provide KC-10 aircrew members with ground-based training
required to meet objectives for initial qualification, requalification, upgrade, senior staff,
differences, and continuation training.

6.5.2. General. Recurring academic and ATD training is designed to ensure that prescribed
subject material is presented in a realistic manner on a programmed basis. Instruction will be
provided by instructors trained and employed by the training contractor and through course
materials developed by the training contractor.

6.5.2.1. Objective. Ensure all aircrews maintain proficiency required to safely operate the
aircraft and effectively perform the assigned mission. Crewmembers will utilize training devices
to enhance training areas that ATDs are particularity well suited to accomplish (e.g., wind shear
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                           71


and microburst training, low visibility approaches, systems knowledge, emergency and abnormal
procedures, etc.).

6.5.3. Crew Resource Management (CRM) training. The KC-10 ATS incorporates CRM
principles during all phases of training including initial and continuation training to meet
requirements of AFI 11-290.         Instructors use AF Form 4031, CRM Skills Criteria
Training/Evaluation as prescribed in AFI 11-290, for CRM skills training.

6.6. Unsatisfactory Student Progress. If a student's training progress is unsatisfactory the
contractor will notify their squadron commander. Following a review of the student's record the
government (Sq/CC, OSS/OST, Det 1, PO/QAR) will determine whether to continue or
terminate training.

6.6.1. The contractor will provide written feedback to the student‘s gaining unit commander or
training office for students who display substandard performance.

6.6.2. Remediation Procedures. ATS contractor and PO/QAR must receive prompt notification
of failed flight evaluations culminating an ATS course. Local procedures must ensure
notification is completed within 24 hours of failure for local evaluations and within 24 hours
after return to home station for off-station evaluations. Remediation subsequent to a failed flight
evaluation may be the ATS contractor‘s responsibility, Air Force‘s responsibility, or a joint
responsibility, depending on the nature of failure. In every case, close coordination is required to
achieve maximum trainee progress. Direct contact with appropriate ATS instructor supervisor is
encouraged.

6.6.2.1. Remediation Scheduling:

6.6.2.1.1. When a trainee is required to return for remediation regarding deficient areas, the
trainee‘s unit, appropriate wing or group training office, and ATS training manager will
coordinate training start and completion dates.

6.6.2.1.2. The ATS contractor will contact the trainee‘s squadron commander if a trainee is
identified, during ATS contractor‘s instruction, to need remediation or additional training. If the
ATS contractor determines no further amount of remediation or additional instruction will result
in the individual attaining required proficiency level the contractor will expeditiously inform
trainee‘s squadron commander verbally and follow-up in writing. As a minimum, the Air Force
ATS PO/QAR will receive a courtesy copy of this documentation. Following a review of the
student's record the government (Sq/CC, OGT, Det 1, PO/QAR) will determine whether to
continue or terminate training.

6.7. Courseware Changes. Changes to ATS courseware may be proposed by any KC-10
crewmember. Complete recommended change on ATS contractor‘s change proposal form and
submit to the local PO/QAR. Change proposals will be sent through wing or group training and
ATS PO/QAR offices to Det 1 AMCAOS. Det 1 AMCAOS will coordinate with the ATS
contractor and the originator and will provide feedback to reflect action taken. Change proposal
forms are available from ATS contractor site training manager at each site.

6.8. Scheduling:

6.8.1. HQ AMC/A3T Responsibilities:

6.8.1.1. Submit the following fiscal year‘s student training requirements to the contractor no
later than 31 January of the current year.

6.8.1.2. Publish and distribute the next fiscal year‘s annual programmed flying training (PFT)
schedule no later than 1 June of the current year.

6.8.1.3. Coordinate changes to the current PFT with the KC-10 program management team and
the contractor and distribute those changes.

6.8.2. Contractor Responsibilities: (These reports are exempt from Office of Management and
Budget review in accordance with Public Law 96-511, The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as
amended, Title 44, United States Code, Chapter 35.).

6.8.2.1. Develop and submit the following year‘s PFT to HQ AMC/A3TK no later than 15 Apr
of the current year.

6.8.2.1.1. Notify HQ AMC/A3TK prior to 15 Apr of the current year for resolution if yearly
PFT request received by the contractor exceeds contracted PFT baselines from either the overall
PFT numbers requested or due to contractor limitations.

6.8.2.2. Provide units with a quarterly pilot, FE, and BO refresher and Additional Training Time
(ATT) schedule no later than 45 days prior to the start of the following quarter. The contractor
will fill any vacancies in each quarter‘s draft WST and BOT schedule with ATT periods. The
goal is to ensure the squadrons have the opportunity to use 100% of available WST time as long
as the contracted ATT throughput is not exceeded. This means the contractor should not leave
an available period unscheduled in the draft schedule due to lack of instructor availability. The
training facility manager and all local KC-10 squadrons will establish mutually agreeable
scheduling procedures.

6.8.3. OG/CC OPR (HQ AFRC/A3TA) Responsibilities:

6.8.3.1. No later than the last week in November of each year, provide HQ AMC/A3TK/A3TF
with estimated training requirements (initial qualification, requalification, upgrade, senior staff,
ATD refreshers, engine run, and additional simulator training time) of their units for the next
fiscal year.

6.8.3.2. Coordinate with HQ AMC/A3TK/A3TF when additional training slots are required.
Additional requirements for training slots will be thoroughly justified.

6.8.3.3. Provide Wing Formal Training with either a form letter or an annotated class roster
indicating the date and names of crewmembers completing their evaluation.

6.8.4. Unit Responsibilities:
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                            73


6.8.4.1. No later than the last week in October of each year, provide OG/CC (HQ AFRC/A3TA
for AFRC units) with the estimated training requirements (initial qualification, requalification,
upgrade, ATD refreshers, and additional simulator training time) of their units for the next fiscal
year.

6.8.4.2. When filling initial, requalification, Aircraft Commander upgrade course, and Instructor
allocations, ensure allocation RIPs are sent to the unit MPF with the minimum: course, class
number, grade, name, and SSN of the individual scheduled for training. Crewmembers are to be
reminded to receive an ADSC briefing by MPF prior to attending training (N/A AFRC). When
training involves TDY, it is unit funded. In this case, units must provide fund cite to the
applicable MPF.

6.8.4.3. No later than 45 days prior to the class start date, units must inform HQ
AMC/A3TK/A3TF (HQ AFRC/DPTF for AFRC units) and MPF or DPMPC with class number,
name, and a SSN of personnel attending.

6.8.4.3.1. A3TK/A3TF will forward this information to contractor site managers at the
beginning of every month. The contractor site manager will compare the A3TK/A3TF list to the
PFT to ensure every course on the A3TK/A3TF list has the same number of students as the PFT.
On the first day of class, the contractor will also ensure only the students designated on the
A3TK/A3TF list are trained. If no student or the wrong student attends the class, the contractor
will coordinate with the unit and A3TK/A3TF to correct the problem.

6.8.4.4. Thirty (30) days prior to the start of a new quarter, all units must notify HQ
AMC/A3TK/A3TF of all allocations they do not plan to use during that quarter.

6.8.4.5. HQ AMC/A3TK/A3TF makes unused allocations available to other units. Normally,
AMC allocated slots remain AMC slots until relinquished by HQ AMC/A3TK/A3TF.
Conversely, AFRC slots remain AFRC slots until relinquished by HQ AFRC/A3TA.

6.8.4.6. Units desiring to trade quotas may do so without AMC headquarters‘ approval;
however, they must inform HQ AMC/A3TK/A3TF and all appropriate agencies and units.

6.8.4.7. Requests for additional training quotas will be submitted directly to HQ
AMC/A3TK/A3TF with information copies to OG/CC and HQ AFRC/A3TA (if applicable).
HQ AMC/A3TK/A3TF will take required action and inform applicable command formal training
(DPPET-AMC and DPTF-AFRC) of any new authorized classes.

6.8.4.8. Coordinate aircrew refresher and additional training time scheduling requirements with
the applicable training facility. The unit will work with the training facility manager to establish
mutually agreeable and effective scheduling procedures. As a minimum, in accordance with the
contract, the contractor will provide next quarter‘s schedule to the units 45 days prior to the start
of the quarter. Units will designate which unit will use each training period and cancel any
training that is not needed. Units will then return the schedule with squadron assignment no later
than 20 days prior to the start of the quarter. Each active duty and AFRC associate unit will
coordinate closely when scheduling ATD training. Training slots that cannot be filled by one
74                                          AFI11-2KC-10V1 _305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


unit must be offered to other units in a timely manner. Training slots should not go unfilled
unless absolutely unavoidable.

6.8.4.9. Ensure the training contractor is kept apprised of scheduling changes or training
requirements. The contractor should be provided as much advance notice as practical.

6.8.4.9.1. (Added)(305AMW) The ATS contractor will be notified a minimum of 24-hours in
advance for all ―ad hoc‖ training requests that would affect the training profile (e.g. CRM or
M050 when not already in the profile). This is required in order to give the ATS instructors time
to evaluate and modify the scheduled profile so that it meets the needs of the student.

6.8.4.10. When practical, the contractor will schedule one ATT per week per active duty
squadron. These ATTs will be scheduled so they may be used for crewmember evaluations on
the third consecutive day following a two-day refresher. Intent is to move active duty simulator
evaluations out of quarterly refresher periods and into ATT simulator periods.

6.8.4.11. When practical, squadrons will use these ATT periods to schedule active duty
recurring simulator evaluations. If practical, try to schedule more than one evaluation during the
same ATT, i.e. a pilot and flight engineer who are both in their eligibility window. Units should
also strive to maintain crew integrity throughout the 3-day period.

6.8.4.12. Squadron Schedulers will notify the contractor training administrator with the names
of the students for refresher ATD periods. The squadron scheduler may replace individuals to
meet mission requirements. If the squadron cannot fill the training session with a full crew, the
contractor must be notified of the cancellation by 1600 Local, the work day prior to the
scheduled training. When the squadron does not fill the scheduled training session and does not
notify the contractor administrator of a cancellation, this constitutes a "no-show." No-shows are
submitted to HQ AMC on the contractor monthly throughput report. Det 1 AMCAOS will notify
squadron Director of Operations of any "no-shows" incurred by the squadron.

6.8.5. Simulator Tours: See paragraph 6.13.

6.9. Administration:

6.9.1. ATS Feedback.

6.9.1.1. Air Force-appointed ATS PO/QARs are primary focal points and the liaison agency
between the Air Force and the ATS contractor. PO/QARs are the only Air Force personnel
empowered to evaluate any component of contract compliance. These individuals are entrusted
with quality assurance, are the only appropriate office (unit-level) to direct contractor to perform
or stop work via the Administrative Contracting Officer's (ACO) or Procurement Contracting
Officer's (PCO) direction, and are accountable for these actions. Each wing or group commander
will establish ATS PO/QARs positions and enforce directives, requirements, and procedures
established by DoD and MAJCOM directives and publications. ATS PO/QARs must maintain a
current copy of the ATS contract(s), designated quality assurance regulations and directives, and
quality assurance procedures.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                         75


6.9.1.2. Operational Evaluation. The ATS contractor is required to evaluate the ATS program
(both formal and non formal) and its graduates‘ on-the-job performance. The objective of this
ongoing ―operational evaluation‖ is to assure the ATS produces qualified graduates. The
contractor‘s system will ensure a steady flow of information to maintain quality, effectiveness,
and currency in the ATS. Revisions to the ATS will be based on this information.

6.9.1.3. Feedback includes inputs from graduates, flight commanders (or designated
representatives), and examiners. Analysis of actual performance (Air Force evaluation) and
trainee critique data help to determine if graduates‘ on-the-job performance meets MTL and
established performance standards. The importance of this on-the-job performance feedback
from graduates, flight commanders, and examiners cannot be overemphasized. This data is vital
to establishing a database to identify trends and support revisions to the ATS.

6.9.2. ATS Data Collection. Internal and external data will be collected, reported, and
corrective actions taken according to approved operation evaluation plan.

6.10. Training Implementation/Student Expectation:

6.10.1. Crew Member Preparation. The crew member is responsible for adequate preparation
prior to reporting for each ATD mission. This includes a review of the mission profiles, pre-
course study material, all associated normal, abnormal, and emergency procedures, and
applicable aircraft systems. The FE CBT systems review will be accomplished during the
quarter for those systems topics.

6.10.2. Mission Pre-Briefing. Prior to each ATD mission, the instructor will brief crew
members on mission objectives, specific training items to be accomplished, scheduled systems
and performance training, crew resource management, and any additional area of emphasis. The
briefing should include data and information necessary to complete the mission, special
procedures, and aircraft systems. The information presented in the briefing should correlate to
the tasks to be reinforced in the training device. It should include any changes or adjustments to
pre-positioned data and a review of the overall mission and coordination of individual
crewmember responsibilities. Prior to executing the scheduled training event, a designated
crewmember should conduct a mission briefing covering AFI 11-2KC-10 Volume 3 briefing
items.

6.10.3. Mission Debrief. Following ATD missions, all aspects of the mission will be discussed.
Emphasis will be placed on all observed weak areas. The crew is required to enter maintenance
discrepancies in the AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document prescribed
by T.O. 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policy and
Procedures and debrief the maintenance technician.

6.11. Browsing Training Products. KC-10 crewmembers and engine-run personnel are
encouraged to browse any and all lessons, guides, and material within the ATS. This is
particularly appropriate to those crewmembers preparing to enter upgrade courses. Use the
following guidelines:

6.11.1. Browser time is on a space-available basis.
76                                           AFI11-2KC-10V1 _305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


6.11.2. Coordinate browser requests with the local ATS site manager.

6.11.3. Trainees are not to be scheduled to browse lessons for remediation. Remediation will be
scheduled by coordinating with the ATS contractor. Browsing a lesson does not enable the
trainee to take the end-of-lesson test. Trainees in remediation will be enrolled in lessons for
review in order to take the end-of-lesson test and keep a permanent record of the remediation.

6.12. Aircraft Flights for ATS Training Instructors.

6.12.1. ATS Contractor Personnel Flight Operations. ATS Training Instructors observe in-flight
operations according to AFI 11-401 and the KC-10 ATS contract. Flights will be accomplished
according to the terms and conditions of a current government contract. ATS contract instructors
who observe local missions (defined as training missions originating and returning to home
station) may observe the mission in Mission Essential Personnel (MEP) status. ATS contract
instructors are authorized (at the Aircraft Commander's discretion) to occupy the flight deck
during any phase of flight. As MEPs, ATS contract instructors may observe all portions of KC-
10 training missions to include tactical maneuvers, receiver air-to-air refueling, tanker air-to-air
refueling, touch-and-go landings, and full stop taxiback landings. ATS contract instructors are
not authorized access to flight controls nor shall they occupy a primary crew position. Units
detail local requirements in a supplement to this AFI.

6.12.1.1. The ATS contractor shall identify, publish and update (as appropriate) a list of ATS
training instructors who plan to fly aboard KC-10 aircraft on observation missions. Personal
factors such as life insurance restrictions may dictate the instructor‘s status. The contractor‘s list
will clearly indicate the status for each instructor. Maintain the list with HQ AMC/A3TK.
Coordinate requests to observe in-flight training requirements with the appropriate OG/CC or
equivalent.

6.12.1.2. The ATS contractor will provide written procedures for their instructor personnel
outlining their compliance with the current KC-10 ATS contract. Included in these procedures
are requirements to provide updated instructor lists of authorized personnel for flights, instructor
requirements prior to flight and during flight, compliance with USAF safety procedures, and
ATS contractor responsibility to return individuals to home station by commercial means at their
expense if required.

6.12.1.3. ATS contractor instructors are required to fly a minimum of one time per year subject
to OG/CC concurrence and the ATS contract.

6.13. ATS Facility Tours.

6.13.1. Wing training offices will coordinate all requests for KC-10 ATS facility tours with the
contractor as soon as possible, but at least 24 hours in advance to ensure the tour will not impact
simulator maintenance or training. Training will not be affected to meet a tour time and tours
requiring whole periods or a significant part of simulator periods will typically not be supported.
The fifteen-minute break during each WST is the most opportune time to accomplish an
orientation without adversely affecting training.

6.13.1. (305AMW) The ATS contractor will contact the appropriate squadron mission control
(AFRC: Squadron Schedulers) no later than three working days prior when they desire to have
one of their instructors fly on a KC-10 sortie. Per the 305 AMW Wing Operations &
Maintenance Plan (WOP), the 305 AMW Wing Commander (Wg/CC) has granted Mission
Essential Personnel (MEP) approval for ATS contractors to fly on squadron training sorties. The
WOP should be referenced for the most up-to-date guidance. The approval authority for MEP
status in the 514 AMW is the 514 OG/CC.

6.13.2. Facility tours may require close coordination with public affairs and protocol. Air Force
option time may be used at the discretion of the OG/CC. Tours will be on an as-available basis
and will not displace scheduled training events.

6.13.3. OG/CC will ensure an Air Force representative meets, greets, accompanies, and
conducts all tours. The contractor is not manned for or on contract to perform these duties. The
contractor shall be responsible for providing an aircrew training device operator only.

6.14. Aircrew Evaluation:

6.14.1. General. The decision of the Air Force examiner as to the ability of the aircrew member
to meet qualification levels as set forth in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, shall be final and will not be
subject to question by the contractor. An AF Form 8 will be completed for all initial and
recurring simulator evaluations. Less than qualified performance will be documented as
Qualification Level 3.

6.14.1.1. Initial Qualification Evaluations. Prior to commencing Phase IB flight training in the
KC-10, each crew member will be administered an evaluation (Q-005 or Q-006 as appropriate)
in the applicable ATD; evaluation will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of contractor training
as well as the capabilities and proficiency of the student. Each initial qualification (IQ) training
device evaluation shall be conducted using either contractor-developed (and Air Force approved)
mission scenarios or local unit standardization-evaluation (Stan/Eval) developed scenarios
(Exception: BO evaluations will be conducted using contractor-developed (Air Force-approved)
scenarios). For unit-developed profiles, the examiner must coordinate with the contractor a
minimum one day prior to the evaluation and ensure it is compatible with ATD software. In the
event of an unqualified rating (ATD or in-flight), a Qualification Level 3 AF Form 8 is issued to
document the unqualified performance and the contractor is responsible for all retraining
(ground-based) in those phases and sub-phases determined to be under the direct control of the
contractor. A joint contractor and Air Force review board consisting of crew specialty
representatives from Group level training, FTU (if an in-flight evaluation), Group and/or
Squadron Stan/Eval and appropriate contractor personnel will review the aircrew member‘s
performance and determine those phases of the ground based courses that require additional
training to meet qualification levels.

6.14.1.2. Recurring Evaluations. Recurring ATD evaluations will be given using either
contractor-developed refresher profiles, evaluation profiles, or Air Force examiner provided
profiles. Exception: BO evaluations will be conducted using contractor developed (Air Force
approved) scenarios. For unit-developed profiles, the examiner must coordinate with the
contractor a minimum one day prior to the evaluation and ensure it is compatible with ATD

software. In the event of an evaluation failure (in-flight or ATD), the appropriate ATD should be
used to the maximum extent possible for retraining and rechecks. Usually, additional training
and rechecks will be accomplished during a unit‘s scheduled ATT periods. In all cases, the unit
must coordinate with the training contractor for ATD or instructor availability. In some cases, it
may be necessary to cancel or reschedule training to accomplish the desired corrective actions.

6.15. (Added)(305AMW) ATS Contractor/Simulator Adverse Weather Procedures. In the
event of inclement weather, personnel are directed to call 754-BASE and comply with any
delayed reporting start times.

7.11.1. M010–Proficiency Sortie. Provides crewmembers specific guidance on items that
should be accomplished during local training sorties that will emphasize core skills. See
requirements listed below by crew position.

7.11.1.1. Pilots: As a minimum, a pilot proficiency sortie will consist of the following:

7.11.1.1.1. Three instrument approaches

7.11.1.1.2. Missed approach

7.11.1.1.3. VFR traffic pattern (weather permitting)

7.11.1.1.4. In addition, the following should be accomplished when available and applicable:

7.11.1.1.5. Circling approach

7.11.1.1.6. Holding pattern or procedure turn (to include entry) Notes: 1. If flown in the aircraft,
once the exercise commences, it should not be disrupted for any other type of training. A
minimum of 1.5 flying hours (1 hour for ARC) should be scheduled for this event. Must be
accomplished with an IP (formal school instructors are exempt from the IP requirement). IPs
should accomplish their M010 requirements with another IP on board the aircraft.
2. If accomplished in the WST, the M010 event does not require any specific time requirements
as long as the requirements listed above are met. Pilots should focus on instrument proficiency
with all engines/systems operating. This event is not intended to be logged while handling
multiple aircraft malfunctions. If an M010 is accomplished in the WST, the students must be
under the supervision of an IP or an ATS contractor pilot instructor.
3. Because holding is incorporated into the quarterly refresher simulator profile, M010 time
need     not    be    spent     on   holding     unless     further     training    is    necessary.
4. If circumstances prevent completion on one sortie (aircraft or WST), credit may be taken after
a second IP-supervised sortie, provided the combined activity fulfills the intent of this paragraph.
5. Instructors should tailor each M010 to the individual pilot's needs.

7.11.1.2. Flight engineers: To credit a proficiency sortie, flight engineers must complete a full
preflight inspection, perform the required pre-departure activities, and applicable panel duties
and checklists for the type mission flown. Half of the semiannual requirements may be credited
by performing a through-flight inspection versus a complete preflight inspection, provided all
other duties associated with a proficiency sortie are accomplished. Flight Engineers should also
complete manual TOLD. Exception: AFRC flight engineers may credit a sortie for missions
flown where a preflight inspection was not possible (e.g., ERCC,), and a preflight inspection was
accomplished at another time. When a preflight is accomplished (not associated with or after
98                                        AFI11-2KC-10V1 _305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011


flight), log a preflight event P361. When required, combine the preflight and through-flight
proficiency sortie events by logging an M013. Logging a combined M013 will dual credit to
M010 and update the monthly proficiency sortie currency requirement.

7.11.1.3. Boom operators: Must accomplish pre-flight through engine shutdown checklist
items and an AAR contact, channel sortie, or cargo load operations. Instructor and examiner
boom operators may credit a proficiency sortie (M010) while instructing or evaluating.

formations; large formations; night receivers and refueling; special mission tasking; special
operations tasking; tactical navigation training; composite exercises; corrective training or
identified weaknesses.

7.11.3. (305AMW) M020 – Unit Specific Training Sortie. May be logged on any local training
sortie.

7.11.4. M030–Overseas Sortie. Familiarizes crewmembers with evolving ATC and 618 TACC
procedures necessary for worldwide mobility tasking and ensures crews are proficient in oceanic
crossing procedures. Sortie includes primary aircrew logging a takeoff (P020) or landing (P190)
outside the 48 conterminous United States and a review of oceanic crossing procedures and
overseas airspace. Airspace considerations (MNPS, RNAV/RNP, AP1/2/3/4, etc.) for the
intended route of flight will also be covered. Crew members performing instructor or evaluator
duty may log this event provided appropriate airspace and oceanic procedures are instructed
and/or evaluated during the sortie. OG/CC may elect to substitute a CONUS operational sortie
for overseas when tanker/airlift requirements or crewmember availability is insufficient for
accomplishing the overseas sortie requirement. Consecutive CONUS sortie substitutions are not
permitted. In all cases aircrew members are still required to review airspace and oceanic
crossing procedures based upon the frequency for M030 in Chapter 4. OPR is HQ
AMC/A3TK. Training Aids and Media: Applicable A3TK and AFFSA Hot Topic briefings.
Locally developed products must be submitted to AMC/A3TK.

7.11.5. M050–Tactical Sortie. Det 1 will develop tactical scenarios for continuation refresher
training. Mission must be flown using a tactical scenario (should use Intel, ATO/SPINS,
Threats, Bulls Eye, etc) and may be logged in the simulator, AOR, during a large force exercise,

Marine Corps unit deployments or redeployments including planning, documentation, loading,
securing, and unloading of combat support equipment and vehicles.

7.13.78.11. Phase III training—Maintain proficiency by accomplishing the maximum number
of items practicable dependent on type of airlift mission accomplished.

7.13.78.12. Static Load Training. When suitable off-station cargo missions are unavailable,
home-station static load training may be used for BO cargo training. Units using home-station
static loading operations for BO cargo training requirements in this volume must adhere to the
following guidelines:

7.13.78.12.1. Each home station static load may be logged by two cargo-qualified BOs.

7.13.78.12.2. Consecutive logging of static loading for P300 credit is not authorized.

7.13.78.12.3. Cargo loading evaluation (initial, recurring, or no-notice) will not be conducted on
home-station static loads.

7.13.78.12.4. Prior to static loading, units must ensure coordination with all agencies has been
accomplished concerning: aircraft, cargo, type of loader, load crew, etc. To be creditable, loads
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                        113


must be verified by senior training section BO. Using one canned load over and over is not
conducive to quality cargo load training.

7.13.78.12.5. All static load operations will be accomplished as if cargo were to be airlifted and
must have all required cargo documentation, i.e. load plans, manifests, hazardous certificates,
joint inspections, etc.

7.13.78.12.6. The BO logging event or being trained in event must complete DD Form 365-4,
Weight and Balance Clearance Form F-Transport prescribed by T.O. 1-1B-50 up to and
including zero fuel weight. Restraint calculations must be computed on all required items. All
T.O. 1C-10K(A)-5, T.O. 1C-10K(A)-9 and command directives/restrictions apply. Note: An
aircraft that departs home station with a locally-developed cargo load and returns to home station
is considered a cargo load and not a static cargo load. On a case-by-case basis, the OG/CC may
approve this option to ensure P300 currency. If OG/CCs exercise this option, the loads must be
verified by senior training section BO prior to flight to ensure that boom operators are receiving
quality training. Because "canned" cargo loads are not conducive to quality cargo load training
if done repetitively, the Operations Group Training Section will ensure that the cargo loads are
changed each semi-annual period to provide a variety of cargo for training.

7.13.79. P310–Instructor and Evaluator Duties and Techniques.

                        AIRCREW TRAINING DOCUMENTATION

A2.1. General Information. This attachment provides standardized guidelines on proper
training documentation. Instructions are provided for AF Form 4022, Aircrew Training Folder,
AF Form 4023, Aircrew Training Progress Report, AF Form 4024, Aircrew Training
Accomplishment Report, and AF Form 4025, Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report, and aircrew
training guides. These forms are prescribed in AFI 11-2C-5 Volume 1, C-5 Aircrew Training.
A2.1.1. Initiate a training folder (AF Form 4022 ) for Table 6.2 formal training (either at formal
school or in-unit), mission qualification, special qualification or certification training, in-unit
upgrade program to the next higher crew qualification, requalification training (either at formal
school or in-unit), or for any corrective action or additional training.

A2.1.1.1. The unit operations officer may waive the training folder requirement if corrective
action or additional training is limited. If initiated, the instructor or flight examiner who
evaluated the aircrew member‘s performance will enter comments pertinent to the training
deficiency on AF Form 4023 or the training guide. Use the existing training folder for end-of-
course evaluations that result in additional training.

A2.1.1.2. At the unit‘s discretion, training folders for an individual undergoing more than one
training program in a short period of time may combine all training into one AF Form 4022; e.g.,
a tanker pilot upgrading to AC may have his or her upgrade, mission qualification, and formation
lead training combined in one folder.

A2.1.2. Formal schools will send AF Form 4022 with all training records to the trainee‘s gaining
unit. Squadron commanders will review formal school training records and enter appropriate
comments on the training guide progress record or AF Form 4023.

A2.1.3. Squadrons will maintain the training folders for their personnel in a location readily
accessible to instructors and supervisory personnel. The trainee may review his or her folder at
any time. Electronic versions must be password protected to ensure data integrity.

A2.1.4. The instructor or trainer will review the training folder prior to all training periods.
Those areas not previously accomplished or those in which crew members require additional
training, will be noted for possible inclusion during the current training period.

A2.1.5. Upon completion of training, complete and place an AF Form 4025 in the individual‘s
training folder. Place a copy of the AF Form 4025 in the individual‘s FEF only if directed by
the guidance implementing the associated training. Squadrons will retain all AF Forms 4022 for
1 year then return them to the crew member. Do not insert AF Forms 4022, AF Forms 4023, AF
Forms 4024, or training guide into FEFs. Document in ARMS per applicable event and
paragraph 1.8.

A2.1.6. Training Guides, AF Forms (4023, 4024, 4025), and/or unit overprints may be used for
all KC-10 continuation and formal training. The current HQ AMC/A3TK approved formal
school   training   guides    are   available   on    the    A3TK      CoP     web     page:
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                          149

3&Filter=AM-OP-00-13.

A2.1.7. For purposes of training documentation, classroom-only training conducted at the unit
should be identified as Academic Training (AT). Ground Training (GT) will be considered all
training conducted outside the classroom not associated with a flight or artificial training device.
All G series ground training referenced in this AFI will be referenced as (GT).

A2.1.8. The AF 4324 will be used as a ―source document‖ for recording the various aircrew
certifications. Completed/original AF 4324s will be kept on file in the unit ARMS office for the
duration of the aircrew member‘s assignment and released to the member upon reassignment.
AF 4324, blocks 1 – 5 and 11 – 13, will be used to document any new aircrew certification and
award of specific ARMS ―Q‖ code identifiers. Specifically, block 11 will contain the following
minimum information: Q code (i.e. QXXX), Certification Name (i.e. Phoenix Banner), and date
of certification. Forward completed form to the unit ARMS section for processing.
A2.2. Instructions for AF Form 4022. This form is a folder constructed of hard stock paper.
The inside covers have tables for documenting training. AF Forms 4023, 4024, 4025, and
additional information (waivers, memorandums, etc.) will be attached through the centered holes
of the folder. Training guides will be placed inside the folder. The form is available through
unit publications distribution offices or the AMC Command Publication Distribution Center.
Units may organize the 4022 to fit their needs provided all necessary documentation is included
in this folder. This includes the use of tabs and/or dividers when multiple certifications or phases
of training are included in one training folder (i.e. MPD folder with Phase I, Phase II, various
certifications, continuation training, PCO, Aircraft Commander Phase II training). Comply with
the following when documenting aircrew training on the form. Note: Formal school instructors
using ATS courseware are not required to complete the following sections of the AF Form 4022:

A2.4.8.3. "F"–Familiarization item; proficiency is not required. The operations group
commander or equivalent operations function will determine whether "F" items are completed by
briefing, demonstration, observation, or actual accomplishment.

A2.4.8.4. "P"–Proficient; crew member has achieved the required proficiency level.

A2.4.8.5. "S"–Satisfactory; crew member has not achieved the required proficiency level but
progress is satisfactory.

A2.4.8.6. "U"–Unsatisfactory; crew member was previously proficient, but has regressed or
progress is unsatisfactory. Note: Events preceded by an (*) are trained to proficiency by the
contractor in the appropriate ATD during phase 1A; however proficiency in the ATD may in
some cases not equate to full aircraft proficiency due to differences in the real-world flight
environment. For this reason a student may be graded ―S‖ until full aircraft proficiency is
demonstrated in phase 1B for an event graded ―*P‖ in the ATD. An ―S‖ grade denotes
satisfactory progression and does not require contractor notification. However, once a crew
member has received ―P‖ for an event (in phases 1A, 1B or II), the only subsequent grade
allowed is either ―P‖ or ―U‖. Likewise, too many ―S‖ grades in a row may indicate lack of
progression and warrant a ―U‖. Any event graded ―U‖ must have an associated remark on AF
Form 4023.

A2.4.9. Total Number Required. Indicates the total repetitions of an event or task required by
the course syllabus.

A2.4.10. Total Number Accomplished.            Total of the number of repetitions actually
accomplished.

A2.4.11. Required Proficiency Level (RPL). RPL for the specific event and task. Each event
and task will have a performance standard designated for the required proficiency level the crew
member must achieve. In addition, each event and task may have (optional) a knowledge
standard designated and used in the same manner as a performance standard. The standards for
specific events are either listed in the applicable master task list (MTL) and evaluation standards
document (ESD) for each weapon system or identified in this volume. For the KC-10, all events
will have an RPL of "3" for performance and "C" for knowledge (if knowledge standards are
used in addition to performance standards). KC-10 units may use ―P‖ to signify the RPL has
been attained. Performance and knowledge standards follow:

A2.4.11.1. Regression. Once a crewmember has received ―P‖ for an event, the only subsequent
grade allowed for that event is either ―P‖ or ―U‖. Regression occurs when a maneuver is graded
―U‖ after having achieved ―P‖ in the same task. Regression from a ―P‖ to a ―U‖ requires an
explanation in the student‘s training folder. The overall grade is at the instructor‘s discretion.
For regression, the student will re-obtain proficiency prior to the end of the block of training in
order to be recommended for an evaluation (when applicable) or certification (when applicable).
A2.5. Instructions for the AF Form 4025.

A2.6.3.2. Complete the training progress record portion of the TG in sufficient detail to specify
areas of training accomplished, areas needing improvement, recommended specific study areas
for the trainee, and recommended training for the next training period. When the trainee attains
sufficient knowledge, experience, and prerequisites for upgrade, the instructor will recommend
an evaluation and state: "Recommend evaluation for (crew position)" on the training progress
record. Trainees will not be recommended for an evaluation if a TG required event is incomplete
or requires corrective action.

A2.6.3.3. On missions without an instructor or examiner, the senior qualified counterpart (e.g.
AC for pilots, etc.) will accomplish required training for those areas not requiring an instructor.
Annotate applicable training information in the TG.

A2.6.3.4. When an initial qualification flight evaluation is not successfully completed and
additional training is required, the flight commander will annotate deficient areas on reproduced
pages of the appropriate TG and training progress record. This mini-TG will be placed in the AF
Form 4022 and used to document completion of additional training.

A2.6.3.5. At the conclusion of training, when all requirements of the TG are met, fill-out an AF
Form 4025 in accordance with this volume. Maintain completed TG and associated AF Form
4025 in a training folder according to paragraph A2.1.5.

                                           Attachment 3
                       FORMAL TRAINING UNIT (FTU) GUIDANCE

A3.1. General Requirements. This attachment specifies the minimum training requirements
for KC-10 qualification training. Qualification training for KC-10 crew members consists of
Phases IA and IB requirements. Phase IA is administered by the training contractor and Phase
IB is administered by US Air Force instructors. Phase IA training is contractor-developed and
Air Force-approved. The objective of Phase IA training is to minimize aircraft flying training
within simulation and human factor constraints. Phase IB training validates transfer of training
from Phase IA; however, Phase IB training is driven primarily by training aircrews to
proficiency in receiver AAR, formation and various types of approaches, and landings as well as
experience in the differences of the real-world flight environment. All Phase IB training for
most, if not all, students will be accomplished at the appropriate AMC FTU.
A3.1.1. Instructor Requirements. All flight training conducted under this attachment must be
supervised by a qualified instructor of like specialty. Crew members undergoing initial
qualification training will be under "direct instructor supervision" during critical phases of flight.
Exceptions: The requirement for "direct instructor supervision" during tanker AAR is not
required for initial qualification students after demonstrating proficiency in tanker autopilot-off
AAR {R080} and are recommended for ―supervised AAR‖ by an instructor pilot. During initial
qualification training, once the student demonstrates the ability to taxi the aircraft safely (no
sooner than after sortie 1), they may be certified by their instructor to taxi without direct
instructor supervision.

A3.1.1.1. Two KC-10 PIC students or one PCO and one KC-10 PIC student may sit in the seats
together for all events in which they are current and qualified.

A3.1.2. The training and upgrade folder of individuals undergoing training under this attachment
must be reviewed by the instructor prior to each mission briefing for each sortie. Areas that were
previously identified unsatisfactory or unsafe must be reviewed and corrective measures
discussed in detail with the student. In coordination with the FTU chief, the instructor will
ensure that the training contractor is apprised of less than satisfactory activity of a student
undergoing Phase IB training. If appropriate, additional academic and ATD training may be
coordinated and scheduled with the training contractor.

A3.1.3. All pilots will be dual seat qualified. Dual-seat qualified ACs must be capable of
accomplishing AC duties from the left seat and pilot duties from the right (i.e. no requirement to
be right-seat qualified in receiver AAR).

A3.1.4. Prior to commencing Phase IB flight training in the KC-10 each crew member, with the
exception of Instructor upgrade and SSF students, will be administered an evaluation (Q-005 or
Q-006 as appropriate) in the applicable ATD. This evaluation will be used to assess the
effectiveness of contractor training as well as the capabilities and proficiency of the student.

A3.2. Initial Qualification Training. Conducted at the appropriate contract training facility
and Air Force unit. Training is designed to qualify aircrew members in specific crew positions
of the KC-10 aircraft. Initial qualification training requirements are found in the appropriate

syllabus (located on the A3T website) or in Table A3.2. and Table A3.3. Once published, the
appropriate syllabus will take precedence over this volume. Specific course prerequisite, entry
qualifications, and other requirements are listed in Table 6.1.

A3.2.1. KC-10 ACIQ–Aircraft Commander Initial Qualification (PTX-1): Qualifies prior MWS,
FAIP, and OSA Aircraft Commanders as a KC-10 Aircraft Commander.

A3.2.2. KC-10 PIQ–Pilot Initial Qualification: Qualifies an SUPT graduate to operate the KC-
10 from both seats but does not result in an Aircraft Commander certifiable pilot. The pilot will
be Aircraft Commander certified in unit or via PCO per Chapter 5.

A3.2.3. KC-10 FBP – Flight Engineer Basic Prequalification Course: Provides required training
for Senior Airman and above with no prior MWS experience to successfully complete KC-10
FIQ follow on. Requires BFE (Lackland AFB) prerequisite.

A3.2.4. KC-10 FIQ – Flight Engineer Initial Qualification: Qualifies prior fixed wing MWS
Flight Engineer Senior Airman and above as KC-10 Flight Engineer. Experience requirement is

(see paragraph A3.2.3) as KC-10 Flight Engineer.

A3.2.5. KC-10 BBQ – Boom Operator (Basic) Initial Qualification: Qualifies enlisted member
as KC-10 Boom Operator. Requires BBO (CEA CoE) prerequisite.

A3.2.6. KC-10 SSF – Senior Staff Officer Familiarization Course: The contractor-administered
Senior Staff Officer Familiarization Course consists of three days of academic and simulator
training followed by one aircraft flight. It is intended for familiarization only and does not lead
to qualification in the aircraft. Senior Staff Officers who complete this course cannot log FP
time nor be at a set of controls with passengers on the aircraft.

A3.2.7. KC-10 SOC – Senior Officer Course: The Senior Officer Course consists of 5 days of
contractor administered academic and simulator training followed by approximately four flights
with Air Force instructors. This training is the minimum required to attain basic qualification in
the aircraft. with instructor supervision.

A3.2.7.1. School Quotas for Senior Officer courses are controlled by HQ AMC/A3TF/K. These
courses are scheduled according to need in cooperation with the ATS contractor. Training
throughput requirements may affect availability of these courses. Requests for training should be
forwarded to HQ AMC/A3TF/K (AFRC users contact AFRC/A3TA). HQ AMC/A3TF will
work in conjunction with HQ AMC/A1A and AFRC/A1T to finalize course approvals and
schedules. These requests must be submitted a minimum of 45 days prior to requested start date.
HQ AMC/A3 will be final authority should a disagreement arise regarding eligibility.

A3.3. Upgrade Training. Individuals may upgrade to aircraft commander via the formal Pilot
Check Out Course (PCO) or in-unit. The preferred method for aircraft commander upgrade is
PCO. The requirements for this course (Phase IB) are listed in Table A3.3 and Table A3.4

A3.4. Aircrew Instructor Program. Courses are designed to teach selected crew members
fundamentals and concepts of instructing.
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                            161


A3.4.1. Pre-course materials will be provided by the contractor to the unit no later than 35 days
prior to course start date. The package will contain a road map of the course, supplemental
materials, pre-course reading assignments, and a course workbook. Squadron Training Units
should request pre-course materials from the site contractor.

A3.4.2. Specific course prerequisites, entry qualifications, and other requirements are listed in
Table 5.3. All instructor candidates will be trained to a level of proficiency that will ensure their
ability to instruct and supervise student activity. Successful completion of ground and flight
requirements, including completing an AFI 11-202, Volume 2, as supplemented, evaluation,
qualifies the individual to be placed in instructor status.

A3.4.2.1. KC-10 PIC – Pilot Instructor Course: Qualifies current and qualified KC-10 AC as a
KC-10 IP.

A3.4.2.2. KC-10 FIC – Flight Engineer Instructor Course: Qualifies current and qualified KC-10
FE as a KC-10 IF.

A3.4.2.3. KC-10 BIC – Boom instructor Course: Qualifies current and qualified KC-10 MB as a
KC-10 IB.

A3.5. Formal Training Unit. The flying phase of training is accomplished at the Formal
Training Unit (FTU). The philosophy of the school is objective-based training vice a syllabus
based program. Although a considerable amount of time is spent mission planning for sorties,
due to the dynamic nature of the tanker mission, instructors are given great flexibility in
accomplishing activity during sorties. Therefore, the syllabi, where published, provide a
recommended number of sorties. Training is complete once proficiency is gained in all the
required areas (see Table A3.3 and Table A3.5). Table A3.1 may be used as a guide to
determine how long the average student remains in training.

A3.5.1. In order to ensure continuity of training, limit the number of different flight instructors
to a maximum of four for students undergoing qualification, requalification, or upgrade training
(not applicable for all AFRC training and active duty initial cargo qualification). Squadron
commanders may waive the four-instructor limit on a case-by-case basis. The flying squadron
commander, operations officer, DET 1 AMCAOS personnel, and FTU Chiefs (Pilot, FE, and
BO) do not count against the four-instructor rule. A copy of the waiver (including waiver
justification) will be filed in the AF Form 4022. Additionally, each student will have one
instructor who will monitor the student‘s progress throughout their training. This primary
instructor will be designated, in writing, and will personally ensure the student is proficient in all
required areas and is ready for evaluation if required.

A3.6. Failure To Complete Formal Training. If any crew member fails to complete a formal
course, the formal school will send a recommendation to the individual‘s unit on whether he or
she should complete training in-unit (which requires a waiver), be eliminated, or return to the
formal school for training.
A3.6.1. Phase IA. An individual may be removed from Phase IA training if identified by the
training contractor as incapable of successfully completing a course of instruction. A joint Air
Force and contractor review of the identified student‘s record will be conducted and a joint
recommendation made as to termination or continuation. The training contractor will notify the
applicable squadron commander and Det 1 AMCAOS to determine the appropriate course of
action.

A3.6.1.1. Det 1 AMCAOS will:

A3.6.1.1.1. Review training records to ensure the training provided was within contract
requirements and guidelines.

A3.6.1.1.2. Review required procedures and assist local units in taking appropriate action to
ensure that aircrew members who cannot meet training proficiency standards are eliminated from
training. See AFI 11-402.

A3.6.1.2. The squadron commander will:

A3.6.1.2.1. Chair Air Force and contractor review of the identified student‘s record.

A3.6.1.2.2. Request the contractor to provide additional training if appropriate.

A3.6.1.2.3. If the student is to be eliminated from training, notify HQ AMC/A3TK and HQ
AFRC/A3T (AFRC disqualification or suspension from aviation service), via message with
information to the appropriate NAF/A3T if applicable.

A3.6.2. Phases IB, II, and III. If an individual is unable or unwilling to complete any phase of
training, the determination of the appropriate administrative action rests with the squadron
commander. (See AFI 11-402 for flight evaluation board [FEB] or administrative procedures.)

 NOTES:
 1. Events annotated *P are trained to proficiency by the contractor in the appropriate ATD
 during Phase IA and do not need to be accomplished in the aircraft. If accomplished in the
 aircraft the FTU instructor will grade the student‘s proficiency and abilities. If the student is
 not proficient in the event, additional training will occur in the ATD or the aircraft. At the
 discretion of the FTU Flight Commander, any *P items may be required to be flown in the
AFI11-2KC-10V1_305AMWSUP_I 6 JUNE 2011                                                        167


 aircraft. The FTU Flight Commander will notify the contractor and HQ AMC/A3TK of
 trends in *P event regression.
 2. Must be completed prior to starting Phase IB training.
 3. Proficiency must be demonstrated from both seats by ACIQ/PIQ.
 4. May be accomplished in conjunction with the aircraft field trip (G025).
 5. Student must demonstrate proficiency in one of these three approaches. If others are
 performed, they must be performed to "P" levels. If not flown, approaches will be trained to
 "B" level.
 6. Proficiency must be demonstrated prior to passenger handling evaluation.
 7. May be accomplished during Phase II if not accomplished in Phase I. Tactics training
 for initial qualification students is accomplished in the WST as part of Phase IA training and
 not required in the aircraft. If accomplished in the aircraft, proficiency in PNF or PF duties
 are required based on aircrew position level. See paragraph 3.6 for additional information.
 8. Pilot students must be day proficient before attempting night contacts. ACIQ students
 must demonstrate proficiency in both KC-135 and KC-10 day AAR and proficiency behind
 one or the other at night. PIQ students can accomplish these events in the WST.
 9. Boom Operators: Asterisk applies only to air refueling operator (ARO) station
 inspection, BOs preparation for contact and post AAR (boom and drogue), AAR,
 emergency and abnormal procedures checklists.
 10. Normally completed in Phase IB or II. FTU‘s will not delay students in training in an
 attempt to accomplish the applicable training events. Students may receive their initial
 qualification evaluation after receiving AAR training with heavy receivers. Certifications
 will be documented on AF Form 4025 and AF Form 4324 (see paragraphs 5.6.4 and
 5.6.4.1).

NOTES:
1. Events annotated *P are trained to proficiency by the contractor in the appropriate ATD
during Phase IA and do not need to be accomplished in the aircraft. If accomplished in the
aircraft the FTU instructor will grade the student‘s proficiency and abilities. If the student is
not proficient in the event, additional training will occur in the ATD or the aircraft. At the
discretion of the FTU Flight Commander, any *P items may be required to be flown in the
aircraft. The FTU Flight Commander will notify the contractor and HQ AMC/A3TK of
trends in *P event regression.

 2. AA01 is required for instructor upgrade courses if realignment for annual checkride is not
 required/desired. AA21 will be accomplished when realignment is required/desired.
 3. Boom Operator: Asterisk applies only to air refueling operator (ARO) station inspection,
 BOs preparation for contact and post AAR (boom and drogue), AAR, emergency and
 abnormal procedures checklists.
 4. Student must demonstrate proficiency in one of these three approaches. If others are
 performed, they must be performed to "P" levels. If not flown, approaches will be trained to
 "B" level.
 5. Proficiency must be demonstrated prior to passenger handling evaluation.
 6. May be accomplished during Phase II if not accomplished in Phase I for AC students.
 Initial CRM (G231) is normally incorporated into all initial qualification courses.
 7. AC students must be day proficient before attempting night contacts. AC students must
 demonstrate proficiency in both KC-135 and KC-10 day AAR and proficiency and behind
 one or the other at night. KC-10 PIC students may demonstrate proficiency behind either
 aircraft.
 8. Tactics events have been completed during Phase IA and are not required to be re-
 accomplished during Phase IB or II.
 9. The KC-10 PIC student must have direct control of the aircraft while occupying either
 pilot position.
 10. The KC-10 PIC student need not be at a set of controls but must demonstrate the ability to
 instruct to a proficient level while the event is being accomplished.
 11. In addition to the *P for maneuver accomplishment, the KC-10 PIC student must
 demonstrate a student briefing.


A3.7. Training Time Limitations. Aircrew members entered in a qualification, requalification,
or upgrade training program should be dedicated to that program on a full time basis.
Individuals who enter initial qualification, requalification, or upgrade training at the formal
school are subject to the time requirements in Table A3.6 and Table 1.2.
A3.7.1. In order to assure training continuity, the student‘s first Phase IB flight should occur no
later than 7 days after completing FTU in-processing to include indoctrination and block
training.
A3.7.2. Follow guidance from paragraph 1.7 regarding training time limitations. Sq/CC training
time extensions only apply during the mission qualification phase of training.
A3.7.3. Enter in the training review panel (TRP) the names of all individuals not initially
qualified or MR (qualified) within (refer to for additional information on Phase II) time limits.
Reasons for failure to complete training within these limits will be fully explained.
