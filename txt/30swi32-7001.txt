Compliance with this instruction is mandatory and it applies directly to individuals who must
comply with all its terms. Violation may result in punitive or adverse administrative action,

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises SWI 32-7001 by changing Chapter 23 “Apiary Hobbyists” so that
bee keeping is no longer allowed on Vandenberg AFB. This change is being enacted to comply
with federal law and per recommendations from AF entomologist/Pest Management subject
matter expert advising against apiaries on AF property. Per 10 USC TITLE 10 and AFI 32-
9003, use of Air Force property by a non-Air Force entity requires that a real property lease be
issued to the user. There are presently no leases issued on VAFB for an apiary nor are adequate
staff resources available for the issuance of such a permit for a non-mission related activity.. A
margin bar (|) indicates newly revised material.

27. Seasonal Beach Access Restrictions to Protect Threatened or Endangered Species
   27.1. The western snowy plover is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act
   because over one-half of their historical nesting habitat has been destroyed or degraded.
   Vandenberg AFB beaches are among the very few sites that still support significant numbers
   of nesting plovers. Therefore, seasonal beach access restrictions are in effect during the
   western snowy plover breeding season, from 1 March through 30 September each year. All
   Vandenberg beaches are to be closed where western snowy plovers breed, except for the
   following three distinct posted areas.
      27.1.1. Approximately 0.5 mile of Surf Beach in the vicinity of Surf Station;
      27.1.2. Northernmost 0.25 mile of Wall Beach;
22                                                         30SWI32-7001 25 JANUARY 2012


     27.1.3. Northernmost 0.5 mile of Minuteman Beach. NOTE: Beach access will be
     permitted from sunrise to sunset in the open areas of Wall and Minuteman Beaches only,
     seven days/week. The open area of Surf Beach is open from 0800-1800 daily. The open
     and closed areas are clearly posted with fences and signs.
  27.2. Rules for beach use during the western snowy plover restriction period are as follows:
     27.2.1. No pets allowed.
     27.2.2. No beach fires.
     27.2.3. No littering.
     27.2.4. No motorized vehicles or bicycles.

  from unauthorized entry, will also be included in the violation total. If the violation limit is
  exceeded for any beach area, that area will be closed for the remainder of the season.
  Therefore, compliance by ALL beach visitors is extremely important if beach access is to be
  maintained for everyone throughout the season.
