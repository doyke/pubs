SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Changes to this publication are administrative, to include updates to Org changes and to reflect
AEDC name change. The word “groups” was replaced with “divisions” throughout the
instruction to reflect the organizational change at AEDC.
1. AEDC divisions: Will report all DVs visiting their division to the AEDC protocol office as
soon as the division is aware of the visit. The division will report DV information on the AEDC
Form 889, Distinguished Visitor Notification Report, located on the AEDC publication web site.
2. The AEDC Commander or his designated representative: Will appoint a project officer
who will complete visit arrangements and coordinate visit activities with AEDC protocol and
other appropriate offices.
