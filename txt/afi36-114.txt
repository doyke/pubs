This is the initial publication of AFI 36-114. This instruction implements AFPD 36-1, General Civilian
Personnel Provisions and Authorities. It provides guidance for filing material in the Official Personnel
Folder (OPF) and Merged Records Personnel Folder (MRPF). Title 5, CFR 293 and the Office of Person-
nel Management (OPM) Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping delegated authority to the Air Force to estab-
lish filing requirements for certain documents. The OPM Guide significantly reduced the amount of
mandatory filing in the OPF and delegated agencies more authority in records management. This publi-
cation updates and streamlines previous guidance and policy on maintaining personnel documents.
Within the Air Force, for Civilian Personnel Flights that are regionalized under the Air Force Personnel
Center (AFPC), the OPF/MRPF is a multi-media file existing in hard copy for documents created prior to
1 October 1996 and in electronic format for documents created after that date. The electronic OPF/MRPF
is maintained in the Personnel Automated Records Information System (PARIS). Many records formerly
in the OPF will be maintained in separate files and/or the Defense Civilian Personnel Data System
(DCPDS) accessible by Civilian Personnel Flights and the Air Force Personnel Center. This publication
is used by all Civilian Personnel Flights and the Air Force Personnel Center. It must be used in conjunc-
tion with the OPM Guide. The OPM Guide is available from the local Publication and Forms Manage-
ment Branch. This instruction supersedes the Air Force Supplement to FPM Supplement 293-31, Basic
Personnel Records and Files Systems.
This instruction requires collecting and maintaining information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974
authorized by Title 5, CFR 293; 10 U.S.C. 8013, and Executive Order 9397. System of records OPM/
GPVT-1, General Personnel Records, apply.
