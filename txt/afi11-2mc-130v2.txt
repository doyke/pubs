SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision
reorganized the format of chapters and paragraphs for increased understanding with chapter two
applicable to all crew positions, chapter three applicable to instructors, and following chapters
applicable to individual crew positions. Grading criteria tables have been standardized across
crew positions where applicable and expanded to include specific grading criteria. Evaluation
methods are identified by notes in the crew specific tables as: in-flight only; in-flight and/or in
simulator; and in-flight and/or alternate methods. Guidance was added allowing Weapon System
Trainers (WST) to be used to accomplish evaluations or portions of evaluations if certified by
AFSOC A3T and A3V. Guidance was clarified on the use of SPOT evaluations to document
Special Qualification Evaluations. Multiple Qualification guidance was clarified. Emergency
Procedures Evaluation (EPE), publications checks, and Cockpit/Crew Resource Management
(CRM) guidance was added. In Table 2.1, aircrew discipline and airmanship/situational
awareness (SA) have been added as critical sub-areas. In Table 3.1, all ―Instructor‖ sub-areas
have been modified to reflect the command standard and are no longer graded as critical.

                                            Chapter 1

                                 GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. General. This instruction establishes requirements and grading criteria for ground and
flight phases of initial, requalification, and periodic flight evaluations. Aircrew evaluations will
be conducted in accordance with (IAW) this instruction and AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew
Standardization/Evaluation Program, as supplemented. Specific areas for evaluation are
prescribed to ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of aircrews.
Flight examiners use this AFI when conducting aircrew evaluations. Instructors use this AFI
when preparing aircrews for qualification.
1.2. Applicability. This instruction applies to all individuals performing crew duties on SOF
MC-130 and C-130 aircraft. For the purpose of this instruction, SOF C-130 aircraft encompasses
AFSOC owned C-130E/H, C-130H1, C-130H2, flown as either primary or BAI airframes.
1.3. Key words and definitions.
   1.3.1. ―Will‖ and ―Shall‖ indicate a mandatory requirement.
   1.3.2. ―Should‖ is normally used to indicate a preferred, but not mandatory, method of
   accomplishment.
   1.3.3. ―May‖ indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment.
   1.3.4. ―Note‖ indicates operations procedures, techniques, etc., considered essential to
   emphasize.
1.4. Waivers. Waiver authority for the contents of this document is AFSOC/A3, IAW AFI 11-
202 V2. Waiver requests should be submitted thru Standardization and Evaluation (Stan/Eval)
channels to the AFSOC/A3. AFRC units will submit waiver requests to AFRC/A3V for review.
AFRC/A3V will then forward to AFSOC for AFSOC/A3 approval.
1.5. Supplements. Units are encouraged to supplement this instruction with standard evaluation
profiles that best fit the unit’s mission, equipment, and location. MAJCOMs will forward a copy
of MAJCOM supplements to AF/A3O-AI, through HQ AFSOC/A3V, for approval prior to
publication. Units below MAJCOM level will forward one copy of each supplement to their
MAJCOM OPR for prepublication review.
1.6. Evaluation Procedures. Before the Aircraft Commander (AC) Briefing, the evaluator will
inform the AC of any special requirements. Flight examiners will brief the examinee on the
conduct, purpose, and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation criteria,
prior to flight. Any unique evaluator inputs to the planned profile should be communicated to
the examinee no later than 24 hours prior to scheduled mission brief. The examinee will
accomplish all required mission planning. If an Operations Planning Team or Deployment
Planning Team accomplishes mission planning, the examinee is ultimately responsible for the
accuracy and completeness of all mission planning paperwork. Flight examiners will be
furnished a copy of necessary charts, flight logs, mission folders, and any additional items they
deem necessary.
   1.6.1. Flight examiners will ensure all required training and documentation is complete prior
   to initial or requalification evaluations.
 6                                                     AFI11-2MC-130V2 15 OCTOBER 2012


     1.6.2. Unless requested by examinee and approved by squadron supervision, the examinee
     will be current for all events evaluated during a periodic evaluation.
     1.6.3. Flight examiners will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations,
     but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.
     1.6.4. Under no circumstances will a pilot or flight engineer flight examiner allow the
     aircraft to slow to below one engine inoperative air minimum control speed (Vmca),
     regardless of airspeed tolerances listed for specific areas.
     1.6.5. Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight. During the
     critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations,
     area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required.
     1.6.6. In this document, Tanker Air Refueling applies to both ―Helicopter Air-to-Air
     Refueling‖ (HAAR) and ―Tilt-Rotor Air-to-Air Refueling‖ (TAAR). Receiver Air Refueling
     applies to ―Air-to-Air Refueling‖ (AAR).
1.7. Grading Instructions. All evaluations will follow the guidelines set in AFI 11-202V2,
Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, as supplemented and this volume. Examiners will
use the criteria contained in this volume to accomplish all flight, ground, simulator, and EPE. To
ensure standard and objective evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the
prescribed evaluation criteria.
     1.7.1. Area/Subarea Grades. Areas/subareas will have a two-level (Q/U) or three-level
     (Q/Q-/U) grading system. Discrepancies will be documented against the listed subareas.
        1.7.1.1. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a satisfactory
        knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
        tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
        1.7.1.2. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea
        tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner.
        Deviations from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or
        jeopardize flight safety.
        1.7.1.3. U indicates a breach of flight discipline, performance outside allowable
        parameters, or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely affected
        mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an
        area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of
        the flight examiner, additional training will not constructively improve examinee’s
        performance, it is not required. In this case, the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief
        the examinee.
     1.7.2. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew
     member in order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member
     receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will
     also be unqualified. Critical areas are identified by ―(CRITICAL)‖ in the area title and by
     shading of the Q- block on the appropriate AF Form 3862, Air Crew Evaluation Worksheet.
1.8. Evaluation Requirements. Evaluation profiles will reflect a sampling of the unit’s
missions. Evaluation tables are provided to summarize evaluation areas. Areas common to all
crew members are contained in Table 2.1 Instructor evaluation areas are in Table 3.1
AFI11-2MC-130V2 15 OCTOBER 2012                                                                    7


Evaluation areas unique to each crew position are located in their respective chapter. Each crew
specific chapter defines required events. Evaluation methods are identified by notes in the crew
specific tables and include: in-flight only, in-flight and/or in simulator (see paragraph 1.8.1),
and in-flight and/or alternate methods (see paragraph 1.8.2). For areas without a note, flight
examiners may evaluate at their discretion if observed. If required events are not observed, then
the evaluation is incomplete and will be accomplished on another flight.
   1.8.1. Simulator. WST with a C or greater certification (or Training Value Code (TVC) of
   3 or greater for all areas evaluated as determined by simulator certification (SIMCERT)) may
   be used to accomplish evaluations. SIMCERTs will be located at the AFSOC/A3T website.
   Do not conduct two consecutive evaluations in the simulator (EXCEPTION: Instrument
   (INSTM) evaluations). Initial, special mission and requalification evaluations must be
   accomplished in the aircraft.
       1.8.1.1. If an area/subarea was not able to be evaluated in flight, and the event is certified
       for evaluation purposes in a WST, it can be evaluated in the simulator to complete the
       evaluation. Document in the comments section of AF Form 8/8a, Certificate of Aircrew
       Qualification, which portion of the evaluation was conducted in the WST.
   1.8.2. Alternate Method. When it is impossible to evaluate an area in flight due to
   equipment malfunctions, operational requirements, scheduling restrictions, or weather, the
   area may be evaluated by an alternate method (i.e. procedural trainer or verbal examination).
   If, in the flight examiner’s judgment, an item cannot be adequately evaluated by an alternate
   method, complete the evaluation on an additional flight.
   1.8.3. Grading Criteria. To the maximum extent possible, flight examiners will use the
   grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area grades. Exercise judgment when
   the wording of areas is subjective and when specific areas are not covered. Flight examiner
   judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade. Consider cumulative
   deviations when determining the overall grade.
       1.8.3.1. Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable
       aircraft. In some cases, momentary deviations are allowable provided the examinee
       applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety.
1.9. Unsatisfactory Performance. If the flight examiner observes an aircrew counterpart
jeopardizing safety, the examiner will assume the duties of that aircrew member (provided the
examiner’s flight duty period (FDP) does not exceed AFI 11-202V3 General Flight Rules
maximum FDP for an un-augmented crew). This does not mean the examiner must assume the
examinee’s position any time unsatisfactory performance is observed. If the examiner feels the
examinee can continue safely with supervision, the examiner is not required to assume the
examinee’s duties. However, if the flight examiner assumes the examinee’s duties, assign a
Qualification Level 3 (Q-3) as the overall grade.
   1.9.1. Evaluators     must   report    deviations/discrepancies   from    established
   procedures/directives in any area, regardless of the individual’s crew specialty, to
   squadron/group commander, along with evaluator’s recommendation for corrective action
   IAW AFI 11-202V2 and MAJCOM supplement.
1.10. Additional Training. Flight examiners are responsible for assigning additional training,
at their discretion. Document additional training and completion IAW AFI 11-202V2 and
 8                                                      AFI11-2MC-130V2 15 OCTOBER 2012


MAJCOM supplement. Any approved training device or medium may be used for additional
training.
     1.10.1. Additional training may be accomplished on the same flight as the evaluation,
     provided the unique situation presents a valuable training opportunity (i.e., crosswind
     landings), and the discrepancy requiring the additional training will not result in an overall
     Q-3 evaluation. This option requires flight examiner discretion and judicious application.
     The examinee must be informed when the additional training begins and ends.
1.11. Rechecks. Rechecks should be administered by a flight examiner other than the one who
administered the original evaluation.
1.12. Special Qualifications (QUALs). Special qualification evaluations are administered for
events that are not universal to all members in that crew position. Special QUAL evaluations
may be conducted separately or in conjunction with the QUAL/Mission (MSN) evaluations.
After qualification, areas can be graded as part of periodic MSN evaluations. There are no
requisites for special QUAL evaluations unless specified. Refer to the appropriate crew position
for any special QUAL evaluation requirements.
     1.12.1. Special qualifications result in an AF Form 8/8a. Document IAW AFI 11-202V2 as
     SPOT evaluations. Although a unit may maintain 100 percent of its crew members qualified,
     this documentation is still required due to intrafly and permanent change of station (PCS)
     issues.
1.13. Multiple Qualifications.
     1.13.1. QUAL Evaluation. Aircrew maintaining qualification in any MC-130 aircraft does
     not require an additional QUAL evaluation in the C-130. See AFI 11-2MC-130V1 MC-130
     Aircrew Training for differences training and currency requirements for multi-qualified
     aircrew.
     1.13.2. MSN Evaluation. MC-130 qualified aircrew require a separate MSN evaluation
     (both initial and periodic) in order to maintain mission qualification in the C-130 (exceptions
     to the mission qualification requirement for specific events are outlined in AFI 11-2MC-
     130V1).
AFI11-2MC-130V2 15 OCTOBER 2012                                                                 9

                                    ALL EVALUATIONS

2.1. General. The general grading criteria contained in this chapter applies to all crew positions
and all evaluations. The examinee must satisfactorily demonstrate the ability to perform required
duties safely and effectively. This includes appropriate aircraft systems operation IAW
applicable technical orders, instructions, and directives.
2.2. Requirements. Evaluate all crew members on areas listed in Table 2.1
   2.2.1. Examinations. All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations
   as a requisite to periodic evaluations IAW AFI 11-202V2 and applicable supplements.
   2.2.2. EPE. An EPE is a requisite for all QUAL and MSN evaluations (does not include
   special MSN evaluations. However, emergency procedures will be covered during special
   MSN evaluations). EPEs may be conducted verbally, in-flight, in a simulator, or by another
   method determined by the examiner or unit stan/eval. Group Stan/Eval (OGV) may develop
   EPE guides for each crew position for flight examiner use. EPEs should be scenario driven
   and tailored to the specific crew position. The EPE will include areas commensurate with the
   examinee’s qualification and experience level. Flight examiners should include other general
   knowledge areas as well. For MSN evaluations, evaluate mission-specific equipment and
   situations. EPEs will include sufficient in-flight and ground emergencies to evaluate the
   examinee’s knowledge of systems and procedures to the flight examiner’s satisfaction.
       2.2.2.1. Examinees may use publications that are normally available in flight. The
       examinee must recite all Boldface items from memory and should provide the initial
       steps of emergency procedures that, in the opinion of the flight examiner, would not
       allow time for reference.
       2.2.2.2. Grading criteria for EPEs are outlined in area 5 of General Grading Areas.
   2.2.3. Publications Check. Required for all QUAL or combined QUAL/MSN evaluations
   as outlined in area 12 of General Grading Areas.
   2.2.4. CRM. IAW AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program,
   CRM skills will be evaluated during initial and periodic evaluations. CRM skills are integral
   to all phases of flight; therefore, no specific area titled CRM exists. CRM skills are
   imbedded within specific grading criteria (mission planning, airmanship/situational
   awareness, crew coordination, communication, risk management/decision making, task
   management, and briefing/debriefing) and include all of the skills listed on the AF Form
   4031, CRM Skills Criteria Training/Evaluation Form. Therefore, use of the AF Form 4031
   is unnecessary for evaluations.
   2.2.5. Formal Course Evaluations. All required areas must be evaluated for the type of
   evaluation flown, IAW guidance in this volume. Grade training objectives and related areas
   using the performance criteria in this volume.
   2.2.6. Air Education Training Command (AETC). AETC instructors are considered
   qualified in both the HC/MC-130 Rescue Squadron (RQS) and MC-130P SOF missions once
   they have completed the 58 Special Operations Wing (SOW) differences training program.
 10                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V2 15 OCTOBER 2012


   Therefore, a QUAL and MSN evaluation in one aircraft counts as qualification in the other
   aircraft.

                             PILOT/COPILOT EVALUATIONS

4.1. General. All pilots and copilots require an INSTM and QUAL evaluation. MSN qualified
pilots/copilots require a separate MSN evaluation. Copilots will be evaluated to the same area
standards as pilots unless specified otherwise. Copilot crew coordination will not include duties
and responsibilities expected of an AC.
   4.1.1. Pilots will fly evaluations in their primary C-130 Mission Design Series (MDS) unless
   stated otherwise.
4.2. Requirements. Evaluate all general areas outlined in Table 2.1 on all evaluations. Also,
evaluate all instructors on areas in Table 3.1 on all evaluations.
4.3. INSTM Evaluations. See Table 4.1 for required INSTM evaluation areas. Requisite
(prerequisite for initial/requalification evaluations) is Instrument examination. The INSTM
evaluation will be conducted in-flight or in a WST. MC-130H pilots will not receive an initial,
requalification, or periodic evaluation in the C-130.
   4.3.1. The evaluation profile will include: one precision and one non-precision approach,
   holding or procedure turn, circling pattern, missed approach, and simulated engine-out
   instrument approach. NOTE: CAA individuals considered qualified in the C-130 by an
   evaluation administered under AFI 11-2C-130V2 are also considered qualified in the C-130
   as described in this instruction.
   4.3.2. Initial/Requalification. Individuals qualified in the MC-130E/H/P are considered
   qualified in the C-130 after completion of differences training.
   4.3.3. Periodic. Evaluations may be conducted in the C-130, if the examinee is
   qualified/differences trained in the C-130 (N/A MC-130H).
4.4. QUAL Evaluations. See Table 4.1 for required QUAL evaluation areas. Requisites
(prerequisites for initial/requalification evaluations) include QUAL Open and Closed Book
examinations (or Formal School End of Course (EOC) examinations), EPE, and Boldface
examination. This evaluation is normally accomplished in combination with an INSTM
evaluation. The QUAL evaluation will be conducted in-flight or in a WST.
   4.4.1. The evaluation profile will include: Visual Flight Rules (VFR) pattern, 100%, 50%,
   and 0% flap landings (only ACs/first pilots/instructors will accomplish 0% flap landings),
   touch-and-go procedures, simulated engine-out go-around, and simulated engine-out landing.
   4.4.2. Initial/Requalification. Individuals qualified in the MC-130E/H/P are considered
   qualified in the C-130 after completion of differences training. NOTE: CAA individuals
   considered qualified in the C-130 by an evaluation administered under AFI 11-2C-130V2 are
   also considered qualified in the C-130 as described in this instruction.
   4.4.3. Periodic. Evaluations may be conducted in the C-130, if the examinee is
   qualified/differences trained in the C-130. In addition, CAA pilots multi-qualified on the C-
   130 and MC-130E/P may conduct periodic evaluation in the MC-130 E/P.
       4.4.3.1. Copilot. Evaluate appropriate areas from the right seat.
AFI11-2MC-130V2 15 OCTOBER 2012                                                              21


       4.4.3.2. First pilot. Evaluate appropriate areas from the left seat.
       4.4.3.3. Aircraft commander. Evaluate appropriate areas from the left seat.
4.5. MSN Evaluations. See Table 4.2 for MSN evaluation areas and subparagraph below for
requirements. Requisites (prerequisites for initial and requalification evaluations) include MSN
Open and Closed Book examinations (or Formal School EOC examinations) and EPE. MC-
130E/H/P MSN qualified crew members will not take periodic MSN evaluations in the C-130.
   4.5.1. Initial. The evaluation profile will include a low-level (type specified below by
   MDS) to a time on target/arrival (TOT/TOA), tactical recovery/self contained approach
   (SCA), max effort takeoff and landing (see paragraph 4.5.4), Night Vision Goggle (NVG)
   takeoff and landing, threat reaction, Computed Air Release Point (CARP) airdrop (actual or
   Standard Airdrop Training Bundle (SATB)), and events in the appropriate subparagraph
   below. TOT/TOA will be to one of the events above or Tanker Air Refueling. Copilots will
   accomplish a NVG takeoff and landing using normal procedures (non-ME).
       4.5.1.1. MC-130E/H. Will include Instrument Meteorological Condition (IMC) or night
       mountainous terrain following (TF) and mountainous NVG low-level.
       4.5.1.2. MC-130P. Will include mountainous NVG low-level and Tanker Air Refueling
       (see para 4.5.5).
       4.5.1.3. C-130. Will include mountainous NVG low-level. NOTE: CAA individuals
       considered qualified in the C-130 by an evaluation administered under AFI 11-2C-130V2
       are also considered mission qualified in the C-130 as described in this instruction
       following HQ AFSOC-approved differences training, with the exception of NVG low-
       level (area 50B) and NVG infil/exfil (area 58). These areas must be evaluated during the
       flight phase of either a SPOT evaluation or a subsequent periodic MSN check in order for
       the pilot to be considered fully MSN qualified.
   4.5.2. Requalification. Pilots requiring requalification through an ETCA formal school
   flying training course will use the initial profile described above in paragraph 4.5.1. In
   instances where a periodic evaluation was not completed in the eligibility period or the
   individual was unqualified for any reason up to a period of no greater than 24 months, the
   requalification profile will be IAW the guidance for that periodic evaluation (i.e.,
   mountainous TF, formation, etc.), plus any additional training as directed by the squadron
   commander.
   4.5.3. Periodic. The evaluation profile will include a low-level (type specified below by
   MDS) to a TOT/TOA, ME takeoff and landing (see paragraph 4.5.4), NVG takeoff and
   landing, threat reaction, and events in the appropriate subparagraph below. TOT/TOA events
   may be a CARP airdrop, Tanker Air Refueling, or tactical recovery/SCA. Mountainous
   terrain is not mandatory, but highly desirable. Never conduct consecutive evaluations
   without mountainous TF or mountainous NVG low-level. State in the comment section of
   the AF Form 8/8a if the evaluation was conducted in mountainous terrain and/or if an actual
   receiver was used. Once NVG takeoff and landing certified, copilots will accomplish a NVG
   takeoff and landing using normal procedures (non-ME).

       4.5.3.1. MC-130E/H. Evaluation will include IMC or night TF. As a minimum, NVG
       low-level will be evaluated every other evaluation. Document in the comments section of
       the AF Form 8/8a when accomplished.
       4.5.3.2. MC-130P. Tanker Air Refueling and NVG low-level are required every
       evaluation. For formation qualified pilots, formation NVG low-level and/or formation
       Tanker Air Refueling are highly desirable on periodic evaluations. As a minimum,
       formation NVG low-level or formation Tanker Air Refueling will be evaluated on every
       other evaluation. Document in the comments section of the AF Form 8/8a when
       accomplished.
       4.5.3.3. C-130. Evaluation will include NVG low-level. Never conduct consecutive
       evaluations without mountainous. Document in the comments section of the AF Form
       8/8a when accomplished.
   4.5.4. ME Takeoff and Landing. This event is normally accomplished as part of the
   mission evaluation. For MSN evaluations, first pilots/copilots accomplish the ME takeoff
   and landing evaluation by demonstrating the duties required in the copilot position. As a
   minimum, thoroughly debrief first pilots/copilots on ME procedures. NVG takeoff and
   landing may be credited if flown to ME standards. NOTE: One go-around is permitted,
   provided the aircraft does not touch down short of the zone.
   4.5.5. Tanker Air Refueling.
       4.5.5.1. Initial. The evaluation profile will include a rendezvous, join-up, contact with
       an actual receiver (helicopter or CV-22), and a lost contact/no visual contact procedure.
       Copilots may be evaluated performing only copilot duties during rendezvous and join-up
       and will demonstrate flying ability during contact.
       4.5.5.2. Periodic/Requalification. The evaluation profile will include a rendezvous, join-
       up, and contact procedures. Copilots may be evaluated performing only copilot duties
       during rendezvous and join-up and will demonstrate flying ability during contact. An
       actual receiver (helicopter or CV-22) is required at least every other evaluation (N/A
       MC-130E/H).
4.6. Special Qualification. See Table 4.2 for Special Qualification grading area.
   4.6.1. Tanker Air Refueling (MC-130E/H).
       4.6.1.1. Initial/Requalification. The SPOT evaluation will include a rendezvous, join-
       up, contact with an actual receiver (helicopter or CV-22), and a lost contact/no visual
       contact procedure. Copilots may be evaluated performing only copilot duties during
       rendezvous and join-up and will demonstrate flying ability during contact. Once
       qualified/certified, pilots may be evaluated during periodic evaluations.
       4.6.1.2. If a crew member goes unqualified in Tanker Air Refueling (either through lack
       of currency or not accomplished during periodic evaluation) then accomplish a
       requalification SPOT evaluation to regain qualification.
   4.6.2. Receiver Air Refueling.
       4.6.2.1. Initial/Requalification. The SPOT evaluation will include a rendezvous, join-
       up, contact, and breakaway.

       4.6.2.2. AAR qualification is only required in one MC-130 or C-130 MDS. Once AAR
       qualified, AAR may be conducted in any MC-130 or C-130 in which the pilot is
       qualified/differences trained. Once qualified, pilots may be evaluated during periodic
       evaluations.
   4.6.3. Formation (MC-130P).
       4.6.3.1. Initial/Requalification. The SPOT evaluation will include mountainous NVG
       low-level and NVG Tanker Air Refueling option one/two (actual). An IMC break or
       Tanker Air Refueling lost contact/no visual contact procedure will be evaluated.
       4.6.3.2. Once qualified, follow guidance in paragraph 4.5.3.2.
       4.6.3.3. If a crew member goes unqualified in formation (either through lack of currency
       or not accomplished during periodic evaluation) then accomplish a requalification SPOT
       evaluation to regain qualification.

  4.7.15. Area 43. Final Approach and Landing.
     4.7.15.1. Areas 43a through 43e. Use the following criteria. NOTE: The following
     criteria are written to generally apply to all landings. Flight examiners must apply these
     criteria judiciously to allow for the unique characteristics of each type of landing. Where
     runway configuration, arresting cable placement, or flight manual limitations require an
     adjustment to the desired touchdown point, a simulated runway threshold will be
     identified and the grading criteria applied accordingly. For instrument approaches, the
     examinee should utilize a normal glide slope from either the decision height or from a
     point where visual acquisition of the runway environment is made. Specific items to
     evaluate include threshold altitude/airspeed, runway alignment, flare, touchdown speed,
     and landing crab.
        4.7.15.1.1. Q. Performed landing as published/directed IAW flight manual. Crossed
        threshold at threshold speed ± 5 knots at proper attitude; smooth and positive aircraft
        control throughout the round out and flare; touched down with no crab, and not more
        than 15 feet left or right of centerline; complied with flight manual procedures for the
        use of brakes and reverse thrust. Met the following criteria:

                           NAVIGATOR (NAV) EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. Mission qualified NAVs require a combined QUAL/MSN evaluation. NAVs
maintaining only basic qualification require a QUAL evaluation. Instructors will demonstrate
instructor duties on all periodic evaluations.
5.2. Requirements. Evaluate all general areas outlined in Table 2.1 on all evaluations. Also,
evaluate all instructors on areas in Table 3.1 on all evaluations.
5.3. QUAL Evaluation. In addition to areas listed in Table 2.1 and Table 3.1, QUAL
evaluations will include Note 3 areas in Table 5.1
   5.3.1. Initial/Requalification. NAVs require an initial QUAL evaluation in any variant of
   the M/C-130. The evaluation profile consist of a minimum of two hours using navigation
   procedures for flights in oceanic airspace were the distance between the last suitable and first
   suitable airfield is greater than 5 hours. NOTE: CAA individuals qualified in the C-130 by
   an evaluation administered under AFI 11-2C-130V2 are also considered qualified in the C-
   130 as described in this instruction.
   5.3.2. Periodic. Periodic QUAL evaluations may be on a C-130 or MC-130. Complete
   evaluation as outlined in paragraph 5.3.1 NAVs with two or more years of experience in C-
   130s may accomplish their periodic QUAL evaluation in an operational flight trainer (OFT),
   aircrew training device (ATD), WST, or satellite navigation station (SNS) simulator. Do not
   conduct two consecutive evaluations in an approved aircrew training device.
5.4. QUAL/MSN Evaluations. In addition to areas listed in Table 2.1 and Table 3.1, MSN
evaluations will include areas in Table 5.1 The Tanker Air Refueling rendezvous can be to an
actual helicopter or another C-130 flying Tanker Air Refueling airspeeds. At a minimum,
annotate the following on the AF Form 8/8a Section IV Comments: the type of drop conducted,
drop score, TOT/TOA, type of low-level flown, and if it was conducted in mountainous terrain.
MC-130P NAVs will demonstrate proficiency in both the left and right navigator positions.
Accomplish C-130 MSN evaluations using MC-130 criteria without the Tanker Air Refueling
requirement.
   5.4.1. Initial/Requalification: Required in-flight events include at least 60 minutes of
   mountainous NVG/TF low-level to a tactical event. A tactical event is considered to be
   Tanker Air Refueling, airdrop, or SCA. Though only one TOT/TOA is required, all three
   events must be observed. EXCEPTION: MC-130E/H does not require Tanker Air Refueling
   to be observed on initial/requalification evaluation. The navigator must be acting as the
   primary navigator and actively directing the aircraft during the low-level (NOTE: MC-130E
   Left and Right NAVs are both considered primary NAVs). Mountainous low-level is
   required. If the timed tactical event is a high speed airdrop or Tanker Air Refueling, then a
   separate slow speed TOT/TOA is required. In that case, the evaluator will determine the
   length of the additional low-level.
       5.4.1.1. NAVs requiring requalification for an unqualified period requiring an ETCA
       formal school flying training course use the initial/requalification profile described above
 38                                                  AFI11-2MC-130V2 15 OCTOBER 2012


       in paragraph 5.4.1. with the following exception: The low-level must be at least 30
       minutes.
       5.4.1.2. If a periodic evaluation is not completed within the eligibility period, the
       navigator requires a requalification evaluation. The evaluation profile will be IAW the
       guidance for that periodic evaluation and paragraph 5.4.2, plus any additional training
       as directed by the squadron commander.
       5.4.1.3. C-130. CAA individuals mission qualified in the C-130 by an evaluation
       administered under AFI 11-2C-130V2 are also considered mission qualified in the C-130
       as described in this instruction, following AFSOC approved differences training, with the
       exception of areas 102 (SCA Data/Charts), 114 (SCA procedures), and 127 (Low-Level
       NVG). These areas must be evaluated during the flight phase of either a SPOT
       evaluation or a subsequent periodic MSN check in order for the navigator to be
       considered qualified.
   5.4.2. Periodic. Required in-flight events are the same as initial/requalification evaluations
   noted above with the following exceptions: The low-level must be at least 30 minutes. A
   TOT/TOA and threat reaction is required on all periodic evaluations. The TOT/TOA may be
   timed to a high speed airdrop, Tanker Air Refueling, or slow speed event. A tactical event is
   considered to be Tanker Air Refueling, airdrop, or SCA. Two different tactical events will
   be observed. Though only two tactical events are required, all three are preferable. The third
   event, if not observed in flight, will be evaluated through an alternate method. Do not miss
   the same tactical event on consecutive evaluations. Do not conduct two consecutive
   evaluations in non-mountainous terrain.
5.5. Special Qualification Evaluations.
   5.5.1. Tanker Air Refueling (MC-130H).
       5.5.1.1. Initial/Requalification. The SPOT evaluation will include a rendezvous, join-
       up, contact with an actual receiver (helicopter or CV-22), and a lost contact/no visual

                          LOADMASTER (LM) EVALUATIONS

8.1. General. Mission qualified LMs require a combined QUAL/MSN evaluation. Instructors
will demonstrate instructor duties on all periodic evaluations.
8.2. Requirements. Refer to Chapter 2 for general and Chapter 3 for instructor grading areas
and criteria. LM specific areas and criteria are listed in this chapter.
8.3. QUAL Evaluations. For QUAL evaluations, QUAL Open and Closed Book examinations
(or Formal School EOC examinations), Boldface, and an EPE are prerequisites for initial
evaluations and requisites for individuals who are not mission qualified. The EPE will cover, at
a minimum, one of the following areas during a QUAL evaluation: emergency signals, ground
emergencies, in-flight emergencies (fuselage fire/smoke and fume elimination, in-flight door
warning, rapid decompression, cargo door and ramp failure, cargo jettison, bailout procedures),
and landing emergencies (landing gear retracted and ditching).
   8.3.1. Initial/Requalification. In addition to areas listed in Table 2.1 and Table 3.1,
   qualification evaluations will include Note 1 areas in Table 8.1 LMs require an initial
   QUAL evaluation in any variant of the C-130 prior to MC-130 QUAL evaluations. Required
   events include a minimum of complete aircraft preflight, sortie of any type, and complete
   post flight. NOTE: CAA individuals qualified in the C-130 by an evaluation administered
   under AFI 11-2C-130V2 are also considered qualified in the C-130E/H as described in this
   instruction.
   8.3.2. Periodic. Periodic QUAL evaluations may be on a C-130 or MC-130. Complete
   evaluation as outlined in paragraph 8.3.1
8.4. QUAL/MSN Evaluations. MSN evaluations may be administered concurrently with the
initial QUAL evaluation. RQ evaluations will be administered as required to regain
qualification. MSN Open and Closed Book examinations (or Formal School EOC examinations)
and an EPE are requisites (prerequisites for initial).
   8.4.1. Initial/Requalification. Administer the evaluation to include, as a minimum a
   complete aircraft preflight, completion of the applicable weight and balance forms, HAAR to
   include, as a minimum, one wet/dry contact using NVG procedures, one airdrop, and an
   aircraft post-flight. Airdrop may be any equipment/personnel delivery (military free fall
   (MFF) personnel airdrop, door bundles, or SATB airdrop is not acceptable). EXCEPTION:
   HAAR is a special qualification for MC-130E/H aircrews and N/A for C-130. It will not be
   evaluated on initial/requalification.
       8.4.1.1. C-130. CAA individuals mission qualified in the C-130 by an evaluation
       administered under AFI 11-2C-130V2 are also considered mission qualified in the C-130
       as described in this instruction, following AFSOC approved differences training, with the
       exception of areas 263 (Defensive Tactics/Threat Calls), 266 (Infiltration/Exfiltration),
       268 (Airdrop Rigging Procedures), 271 (Airdrop Knowledge), and 277 (FARP) . These
       areas must be evaluated during the flight phase of either a SPOT evaluation or a
       subsequent periodic MSN check in order for the LM to be considered qualified.

   8.4.2. Periodic. Administer the evaluation on any flight representative of the MC/C-130
   mission and series. This includes airdrop (excluding MFF, door bundles or SATBs), HAAR,
   Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP), and infil/exfil (with certified equipment). Specify in
   the comment section of the AF Form 8/8a the type of mission accomplished. If the
   evaluation is accomplished on FARP or infil/exfil, the following restrictions apply:
   8.4.3. Infil/exfil load must consist of, as a minimum, one four-wheeled vehicle capable of
   transporting at least four people.
   8.4.4. Accomplish FARP evaluations on tanker aircraft under NVG conditions.
8.5. Special Qualification Evaluations. (MC-130E/H). HAAR: LMs will accomplish a night
HAAR to include, as a minimum, at least one wet/dry contact using NVG procedures. If a crew
member goes unqualified in HAAR (either through lack of currency or not accomplished during
periodic evaluation) then accomplish a requalification SPOT evaluation.
