NON-AIR FORCE USE OF RADIATION SOURCES APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS

A3.1. Use of RAM:
   A3.1.1. Air Force Instruction 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force,
   sets USAF policy for using radioactive materials (RAM). It applies to all civilians, civilian
   contractors, Department of Defense, Department of Energy (DOE), and DOE prime
   contractor personnel bringing RAM onto Air Force installations.
   A3.1.2. Non-Air Force organizations that bring RAM onto USAF installations, or conduct
   operations involving RAM on USAF installations, must obtain the approval in writing of the
   installation commander or his designee. To obtain this approval, an application must be
   forwarded to the 319 ABW Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), 319 MDOS/SGOJ, building
   109, DSN 362-5596, with a courtesy copy to the contracting officer at least 30 calendar days
   before the planned date for commencement of activities on the installation. Contractors
   operating at GFAFB, 69 RG and Cavalier Air Station will forward the following
   requirements to the RSO via the site RSO liaison (RSOL):
      A3.1.2.1. A description of the proposed activities on NRC Form 241
      A3.1.2.2. The procedures established to ensure radiological health and safety of Air
      Force personnel and the public while on Air Force installations; the name, local address,
      and telephone number for the responsible local representative; and the name, address, and
      telephone number of the RSO named on their license.
      A3.1.2.3. A current copy of the applicable NRC, or Agreement State License. Expired
      licenses are unacceptable. To be valid at the installation, the license must either
      specifically state the installation by name on the license, or state approval for work at
      temporary job sites anywhere in the United States where the NRC or Agreement State
      maintains jurisdiction. DOE or DOE prime contractors must provide, in lieu of a license,
      written certification of their exemption from NRC licensing requirements and cite the
      applicable exemption of 10 CFR.
      A3.1.2.4. The part of the Air Force contract describing work to be done at the installation
      and the inclusive dates of such work.
      A3.1.2.5. An acknowledgement that the RSOL or RSO can make periodic checks to
      ensure the contractor is following applicable radiological health and safety practices,
      which prevent unnecessary exposures to Air Force personnel and prevent potential
      contamination of government property. The RSOL or RSO must identify deficiencies to
      the contracting officer for corrective actions. In addition, the RSOL and RSO, in
      coordination with the Chief of the Contracting Office, have authority to suspend
      contractor operations believed to be unsafe.
      A3.1.2.6. Copies of the most recent leak test results (not over 180 days old) for sealed
      sources.

                         BASIC RAM SHIPPING PROCEDURES

A4.1. Each receiving or shipping agency must have a separate, marked, and locked enclosure for
the receipt, handling, or shipment of radioactive packages. This separate area is to ensure
personnel not familiar with the proper handling or RAM are not accidentally exposed to ionizing
radiation. This location must be coordinated with 319 MDOS/SGOJ, building 109, DSN 362-
5596.
A4.2. All RAM that are covered by a license or permit must be accounted for by a RAM transfer
receipt, which is separate from any contractual, security, or other receipt documents. Contract
shipping and receiving agencies should obtain transfer receipts when items are dispensed
to the GFAFB organizations.
A4.3. When RAM is received at, or is to be shipped from GFAFB, the RSO must be contacted
by the receiving or shipping agency. The RSO or designated representative will monitor the
container. NOTE: In accordance with 10 CFR 20.1906, all packages labeled with a Radioactive
White I, Yellow II, or Yellow III, as specified DOT regulations (49 CFR 172.403 and 172.436-
440), must be monitored as soon as possible but not later than 3 hours after the package is
received. If the package is received after normal duty hours, the package must be surveyed not
later than 3 hours from the beginning of the next workday.
   A4.3.1. If the RAM received is a sealed source, the most recent leak test results must
   accompany the package, and a copy of these results must be sent to the RSO. If this test does
   not accompany the sealed source, an individual approved by the RSO performs the leak test
   before the item is placed into use. Current leak test results must accompany sealed sources
   shipped from GFAFB.
   A4.3.2. Once the package has been monitored and cleared by an individual approved by the
   RSO, contact the user or custodian and transport the material directly to the user or
   custodian. If the user or custodian cannot be located, store the RAM until the user or
   custodian accepts receipt. Note: Only authorized personnel will open or package containers
   of RAM or items.
A4.4. If the RAM is to be transported from GFAFB, prepare for shipment and packaging per
applicable NRC and Department of Transportation regulations. Contact the RSO for assistance
and shipping surveys.
