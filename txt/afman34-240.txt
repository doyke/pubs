                                               Chapter 1

                          FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM MANAGEMENT

1.1. Evaluating Food Service. The Food Service officer (FSO) uses one copy of AF Form 1038, Food
Service Evaluation Record, to rate food service operations quarterly. Keep a copy of the checklist until
the next evaluation. See the checklist at Attachment 2.

1.2. Five-Year Facility and Equipment Improvement Plan. The purpose of the five-year program is
to provide a comprehensive, phased improvement program that serves as a management tool for the Food
Service officer. The objective is to achieve comparability with generally accepted commercial food ser-
vice standards. Achievement of the objective is dependent on a well-planned program of identifying facil-
ity deficiencies and efficient use of limited funds in implementing the program. All new projects or
facility upgrade projects must be reviewed and approved by the Major Command (MAJCOM) and Head-
quarters, Air Force Services Agency, Air Force Food Service Branch (HQ AFSVA/SVOHF). FSOs are
encouraged to use the Food Service Annual Operations & Maintenance Budget spreadsheet.

1.3. Guest Feedback. Use AF Form 27, Food Service Customer Survey, base, or MAJCOM approved
form to get feedback from your guests. Make forms available to all dining facility guests. The dining
facility manager should respond to guest’s concerns, usually with a telephone call. Make notes of the con-
versation on the backside of the form used and file for future reference.
    1.3.1. The FSO must establish a forum to discuss food service issues with base Essential Station
    Messing (ESM) guests formerly, Subsistence-in-Kind (SIK) guests. As a minimum, attempt to have
    ESM representatives from each organization, Military Public Health, the Prime Vendor, and Health
    Promotions officials attend the meeting. Use results from the meeting to improve the Food Service
    program.

1.4. Recommendations for Improvement. Let your MAJCOM counterpart know if you have sugges-
tions to improve the Air Force Food Service management program.

1.5. Revisions to Air Force Menu. Make revisions for the following reasons only satisfy the prefer-
ences of your guests with due validation, provide choices to accommodate religious observances, and add
culturally diverse, specialty meals, or increase menu variety.

1.6. Posting Menus. Post menus in locations where your guest can see them when entering the service
area. Post the price of each item.

1.7. Computer Malfunction. Food Service managers and cashiers must be aware of contingency plans
to be used in the event that computers or point of sales (POS) are down. Keep a complete set of manual
forms and current Sales Item Listing on hand in case automated operations cease. Recommend the follow-
ing options when POS or computers are down:
    1.7.1. If only one of several POS system is not functioning, route all Basic Allowance for Subsistence
    (BAS) and guests paying cash through the operating registers and all meal card guests through a sec-
    ond line to sign AF Form 79, Headcount Record.
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                    7


   1.7.2. Use adding machines or hand calculators to determine the amount of each purchase by guests
   paying cash. Also, total the amount of each purchase by meal card guests unless this will slow the line
   speed beyond a tolerable rate.
   1.7.3. As a last resort, revert to the standard Department of Defense (DoD) meal rates.
   1.7.4. For ESM customers at all locations, the facility manager will use 40% of the current meal cost
   allowance. Contact HQ AFSVA/SVOHF for the current meal cost allowance.
   1.7.5. At automated locations, the dining facility manager manually inputs the ESM and cash data in
   Sales Entry when the system comes back up. The facility manager must track food items consumed.
   Take the number of servings prepared and subtract the number of servings leftover or discarded. This
   will provide the amount to sell for manual sales items. Exact procedures can be found in the Corporate
   Food Service (CFS) Handbook.

1.8. Menu Item Pricing. At automated dining facilities, the recipe cost and selling price is calculated for
individual portions of each menu item. Each price is based on current inventory item numbers and pur-
chase prices. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF, commonly referred to as Corporate Food Service (CFS), maintains all
files, which contain recipes, inventory items, portion sizes, and sales items. Complete details of all stan-
dard recipes and methods used by Air Force activities are found in the Air Force Food Service Recipe
System, distributed by Headquarters, Air Force Services Agency, Contractor Support Branch (HQ
AFSVA/SVSDA).
   1.8.1. The automated pricing system adds an additional 20% to the basic cost per portion of all items
   served in Appropriated Fund (APF) food activities. This addition is intended to cover condiments and
   shortening that are not recipe ingredients and food preparation losses from spillage, burning, dis-
   carded, etc. Do not charge for condiments, gravy, or sandwich toppings.

1.9. Who Can Eat in Appropriated Fund Dining Facilities. See AFI 34-239, Food Service Manage-
ment Program, attachment 9.

1.10. Emergency Situations. Installation commanders can allow off-base civilians, noncombatant evac-
uees, and family members evacuated from other Department of Defense (DoD) installations to eat in the
base dining facilities during emergencies.
   1.10.1. During disaster or emergency conditions, these instructions apply to all Food Service activi-
   ties:
       1.10.1.1. The installation commander provides the Mission Support Group Commander with a
       statement in writing describing the emergency and the persons to whom it is essential that the Air
       Force furnish food for a limited time.
       1.10.1.2. Use AF Form 79 to record signatures and collect cash.
       1.10.1.3. Collect cash from persons able and required to pay for meals. Ask those persons unable
       to pay for meals to sign AF Form 79 as receiving a meal without charge.
       1.10.1.4. If it is not feasible to obtain signatures, the Mission Support Group Commander certifies
       the number of meals furnished and takes credit for the meals served. Give written justification for
       service of meals without charge or signatures. Keep documentation supporting the entries on AF
       Form 1119-1, Manual Monthly Monetary Report (RCS: HAF-SVS(M)9122). The FSO will
8                                                                         AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005


       forward all documentation to the MAJCOM and HQ AFSVA/SVOHF for approval. This proce-
       dure applies only to all personnel involved in disasters or emergencies.
       1.10.1.5. At automated locations, the dining facility manager manually inputs the ESM and cash
       data in Sales Entry for that day. Find exact procedures in the Corporate Food Service (CFS) Hand-
       book. This procedure applies only to all personnel involved in disasters or emergencies.

1.11. Special Operational Rations for Major Disasters and Emergencies. Food Service operations
are authorized to purchase and store Meals Ready to Eat (MREs) in support of major disasters and emer-
gencies. Purchase a maximum of a 2-day supply of MREs per ESM patron (example: 100 ESM members
x 3 meals per day x 2 days = 600 MREs purchased to support this requirement). Units requiring these
rations will contact HQ AFSVA/SVOHF before ordering any MREs for this purpose.

1.12. Unannounced Spot-Check of Cashier. Use AF Form 282, Unannounced Spot-Check of Cash-
ier, at least monthly to spot check each cashier function to make sure cashiers are using proper procedures
in cash collection and forms control. Prepare one copy and send to Food Service officer for review and
corrective action.

1.13. Funds Protection. See AFI 31-101, The Air Force Installation Security Program and the Installa-
tion Security Plan (ISP) for funds protection in a Food Service facility.
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                  9


                                               Chapter 2

                                     GUEST IDENTIFICATION

2.1. Identifying Dining Facility Guests.
   2.1.1. At Corporate Food Service (CFS) bases, ESM guests use DD Form 714, Meal Card, or DD
   Form 2, Armed Forces of the United States Geneva Conventions Identification Card commonly
   refer to as a Common Access Card (CAC) for identification. The cashier enters the meal card number
   or social security number into the cash register.
   2.1.2. At automated bases, an individual's social security number (SSN) is used from DD Form 2 to
   verify the meal card entitlement. The accountant inputs this data in the main dining facility computer
   database using Frequent Buyer (FB). If the guest's number is not in the Frequent Buyer database, the
   cashier obtains their name, rank, squadron, telephone number, and SSN. The cashier records this
   information legibly on AF Form 1469, Essential Station Messing (ESM) Invalid Entitlements Log.
   The facility manager will turn in the form(s) to the accountant every day. The accountant must
   research each signature on the AF Form 1469, to ensure that only those authorized ESM receive meals
   at government expense. The accountant will make corrections daily in the FB database to ensure the
   information is current. The Food Service accountant normally keeps this record on file with ESM reg-
   isters.
   2.1.3. ESM personnel not on leave or temporary duty (TDY) status may use their meal card from their
   permanently assigned base to eat at other Air Force bases. The FSO will include instructions to be
   used by visiting ESM members in the cashiers' procedures.
   2.1.4. Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corp (ROTC) students in training status are identified by
   DD Forms 714 (stamped ROTC), training rosters, or special orders.
   2.1.5. Enlisted personnel of the Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard on training status are iden-
   tified by DD Form 2AF (RES). At automated locations, input the name and entire SSN of each
   Reserve and Guard member into the Frequent Buyer database for the point of sales (POS). This devel-
   ops a report that eliminates the need for these guests to sign an AF Form 79.
   2.1.6. Members of other active duty services stationed on or attached to a non-automated base use DD
   Forms 714 with "COMMON SERVICE" stamped in bold letters across the front.
   2.1.7. Enlisted members of the Reserve forces and National Guard in annual training status show the
   cashier a copy of their TDY orders. All reserve forces receive standard rate (type S) BAS. The codes
   on orders may read FG, the standard rate of BAS for enlisted or FH rations in kind not available. Refer
   to AFI 34-239, attachment 9, for special circumstances.
   2.1.8. Personnel in a TDY status must present identification and a copy of their orders if they are not
   paying the standard rate.
   2.1.9. Members of Reserve forces and National Guard of other services (e.g., Army National Guard,
   Marine Reserves, etc.) are no longer cross-billed. However, continue to process these guests at the
   cash register as described above.
   2.1.10. Active duty Air Force Office of Special Investigations TDY members identify themselves to
   cashiers using the DD Form 1173, US Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card.
   Block 11 of the card will indicate that the member is active duty.
10                                                                         AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005


                                                 Chapter 3

                          CONTROL OF SIGNATURE FORMS AND CASH

3.1. Forms.
     3.1.1. Control of Headcount Records. Use AF Form 1254, Register of Headcount Record, to control
     the receipt and issue of AF Form 79, Headcount Record.
        3.1.1.1. The Food Service accountant prints the forms, assigns the serial numbers in numerical
        order, and stores them in a locked area. The Food Service accountant enters the serial numbers in
        numerical order on the first column of the applicable AF Form 1254. Make entries on the AF
        Form 79’s serial number in blue or black ink or stamped.
        3.1.1.2. If issuing a single form, have the receiver sign and date the AF Form 1254 opposite the
        assigned number.
        3.1.1.3. If issuing a block of numbered forms, draw a diagonal line through the signature column
        from the top line of the first number issued down and across to the bottom line of the last number
        issued.
        3.1.1.4. The issuing official picks up AF Form 79. Upon completion, enter the date returned
        across from the serial numbers that apply on AF Form 1254. Investigate any missing serial num-
        bers. Enter the amount of cash collected for each sheet in the appropriate columns.
        3.1.1.5. After all forms are checked for accuracy, the person picking up the forms and money (if
        applicable) signs in the "cash received" column of AF Form 1254.
     3.1.2. The Food Service accountant travels to dining facilities, obtains funds and controlled forms
     using AF Form 1305, Receipt for Transfer of Cash and Vouchers to document the transfer of
     responsibility.
        3.1.2.1. The individual collecting cash from dining facilities, consolidates the collection and pre-
        pares DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher. They turn in the consolidated cash to the
        accounting and finance officer who assigns a voucher number to DD Form 1131 and closes out the
        transaction. Record the voucher number in the last column of AF Form 1254 opposite the number
        of each AF Form 79 supporting the turn-in not later than two workdays after receiving it from
        finance.
     3.1.3. Headcount Record. AF Form 79 is the basic record used for collecting and accounting for cash
     received from the sale of meals by cash and ESM customers. It is also used to identify personnel
     served and support headcount. All manual operations will use this form regardless of the type of facil-
     ity. Automated bases will use this form as defined in paragraph 1.7. Make all entries on the AF Form
     79 in black or blue ink.
        3.1.3.1. The cashier obtains only one signature from each person for each meal consumed. If sec-
        ond servings are available, they are considered part of the same meal. Except at automated facili-
        ties, patrons will sign AF Form 79 as follows:
        3.1.3.2. An ESM member assigned to the base enters a payroll signature, grade, and last four dig-
        its of the meal card number or social security number.
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                 11


     3.1.3.3. An Air Force transient enters a payroll signature, grade, and a short abbreviation of the
     parent organization (such as 482 CSS). Enlisted members of other services use their branch of ser-
     vice, instead of meal card numbers. Change the social security number column to read "Org" (for
     organization) if the form is used for transients.
     3.1.3.4. Individuals on common service status sign the AF Form 79 marked for their branch of
     service and enter short abbreviations of their unit organization (such as 41NFBN) instead of meal
     card numbers. Change the social security number column to read "Org" if used for common ser-
     vice personnel.
     3.1.3.5. Individuals on cross-service status sign the AF Form 79 marked for their category. They
     enter short abbreviations of their organization instead of meal card numbers. Change the social
     security number column to read "Org."
     3.1.3.6. If the total number of ESM meals served averages less than 100 meals a day, use the same
     form for the whole day. Separate the signatures that apply to each meal by a dividing line between
     each meal or by a margin notation. Because the form provides supporting headcount data for daily
     sales, use a separate AF Form 79 for each day. Exceptions are small units where daily posting of
     headcount data is not required. In these instances, divide AF Forms 79 by using lines to reflect
     more than one day's use. Use a separate form for each of the special categories of personnel
     served.
  3.1.4. If the number of guests who pay cash is small, the form may be used for the whole day by
  inserting a heavy dividing line after the last signature for each meal.
     3.1.4.1. The cashier requires the entry of each guest's signature, grade, meal charge, and operating
     charge in the appropriate columns. At the end of the meal, day, or duty shift, the cashier totals the
     columns, brings forward the balances, and determines the total collections due, as specified on AF
     Form 79. They block out unsigned lines on the forms and turn over all funds collected to the din-
     ing facility manager. The manager verifies the totals, records any cash overage or shortage, and
     explains any differences on the form in the explanation block. The cashier signs their name and
     grade as the person making collections. The manager also signs to certify the collection and to
     relieve the cashier of responsibility for the cash and forms.
     3.1.4.2. Situations when a designated person may sign and pay for other members:
         3.1.4.2.1. If it is necessary to feed a group within a specified time period, such as at training
         centers and special schools.
         3.1.4.2.2. Under emergency conditions.
  3.1.5. Receipt for Transfer of Cash and Vouchers. Use AF Form 1305 for transferring cash and con-
  trolled forms between facilities, managers, shift leaders, and cashiers. A completed and signed AF
  Form 1305, showing breakdown of cash by denominations, must be on file in the funds storage con-
  tainer whenever cash or controlled forms are removed. Also, use this form to transfer daily receipts
  collected by cashiers after each meal. Complete the form in two copies, one for the person accepting
  the cash and forms and one for the remitter.
12                                                                           AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005


3.2. Cash Turn In.
     3.2.1. In manual operations, each workday the Food Service accountant collects AF Forms 79, and
     the total cash collected for the previous day from each dining facility. Document the transfer on AF
     Form 1305. The FSO or a designated representative:
        3.2.1.1. Verifies and reconciles AF Forms 79 and DD Form 1131 entries against cash.
        3.2.1.2. Determines whether cash overages or shortages reported are reasonable.
        3.2.1.3. Annotates AF Form 1254 to show the date that each AF Form 79 was returned, the
        amount collected, and certifies with his/her signature.
        3.2.1.4. Verifies missing forms and prepares a report of survey, if necessary.
        3.2.1.5. For assessing value use the current DoD lunch meal rate for each line of the form. Such
        loss by a contractor is processed according to contract provisions.
     3.2.2. Cash Turn-In from automated dining facilities. Food Service accountants or other representa-
     tive designated by FSO travel to dining facilities to collect cash, the Sales Offset Report, cash regis-
     ter receipts, and any controlled forms. Use AF Form 1305 to record the transfer.
     3.2.3. Form Preparation for Cash Turn-In. At bases that have both automated and manually operated
     dining facilities, key manual data into Form Flow or other automated form program to produce a com-
     puter-generated DD Form 1131 to submit to Accounting and Finance Office.
     3.2.4. Cash Turn-In to Accounting and Finance Office. The FSO or contractor prepares DD Form
     1131 in duplicate. The original is kept by the accounting and finance officer. File the copy in the Food
     Service office along with supporting documentation. In contract operations, contractors may keep a
     third copy for their records.
     3.2.5. Accounting Classification. Enter the detailed accounting classification obtained from account-
     ing and finance. Also, enter the accounting classification for operating charge funds collected. For full
     Food Service contract bases, deposit 100 percent of this money into the base or Services Operation
     and Maintenance (O&M) account, to assist in funding the contract. For bases with Food Service atten-
     dant contracts or no contracts at all, credit operating charge funds collected to the financing appropri-
     ation, Operation and Maintenance (O&M), and Air Force Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA),
     based on the percentage of local dining facilities military and civilian manpower authorizations.
     Deposit the percentage that results from military authorizations in the MPA appropriation and the
     deposit civilian percentage in the O&M appropriation. HQ AFSVA/SVF publishes these accounting
     classifications in a signed memo yearly.
     3.2.6. Cash Overages and Shortages. For control and information purposes, enter the consolidation of
     cash overages or shortages in the lower part of the "detailed description of purpose for which collec-
     tions were received" column. Use the following accounting classifications for overages: 57R 1060
     ******. Obtain numbers for the asterisks from the base Accounting & Finance office. All shortages
     will have the ESM accounting classification published by HQ AFSVA/SVF. Total all amounts at the
     bottom of DD Form 1131.
     3.2.7. The Turn-in Copy. Food Service uses the turn-in copy of DD Form 1131, which serves at the
     voucher. Use DD Form 1131 as a cover sheet for the AF Forms 79 (as applicable), Sales Offset
     Report, cash register receipts, and for multiple automated operations, the Cash Reconciliation Report
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                 13


   from Corporate Reporting. The FSO enters the voucher number in the last column of AF Form 1254,
   opposite each AF Form 79, as applicable.
   3.2.8. Verifying the Cash Collection. The FSO verifies the cash collected on each DD Form 1131
   using supporting documentation such as AF Forms 79, as applicable, point of sales (POS) register
   tapes, and/or the Sales Offset Report. In addition, the FSO:
      3.2.8.1. Verifies the number of collection sheets used to make up the voucher.
      3.2.8.2. Totals the amounts collected and ensures the correct funds were turned in on DD Form
      1131.
      3.2.8.3. Verifies the accounting and finance office has stamped DD Form 1131 with the time,
      date, and amount deposited. Under the Integrating Paying and Collecting system (IPC), make sure
      the finance cashier has signed or initialed the cash collection voucher.
      3.2.8.4. After verifying, initial the DD Form 1131 in the "total" item.
      3.2.8.5. At least monthly, check totals on DD Form 1131 with Finance to ensure proper amounts
      are turned in.

3.3. Accounting for Funds Collected from Local National Personnel Overseas.
   3.3.1. Meal reimbursement charges apply to direct hire local nationals at Air Force or overseas,
   appropriated fund Food Service facilities operated by local nationals, unless existing agreements
   establish other rates. In those cases, rates for these personnel are established locally and require HQ
   AFSVA/SVOHF approval.
   3.3.2. The difference between the amounts paid by local national employee and the meal charges
   specified must be paid from the appropriation from which the local national personnel salaries are
   paid. Commanders establish internal accounting controls and budget for funds to provide the differ-
   ence so that full reimbursement is made to the subsistence fund.
   3.3.3. At non-automated activities, local national personnel paying cash for meals (reduced or full
   payment) or not paying for meals sign AF Form 79. When meals are sold at a reduced rate, the facility
   manager takes full credit regardless of the amount of payment. On DD Form 1131, the manager shows
   cash collected from these personnel as a separate entry to avoid double credit. When collections are
   not in US currency, the accountant prepares a separate DD Form 1131.
   3.3.4. If at all possible, the next revision of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) should indi-
   cate that cross service reimbursement be discontinued and require all members and local nationals to
   pay cash when eating in the dining facility.
14                                                                           AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005

                              MANUAL FOOD SERVICE ACCOUNTING

4.1. Manual Sales Form. AF Form 1650b, Manual Sales form must be maintained for each manual din-
ing facility. The Food Service manager uses one copy of this form to recap the number of meals served to
each category of personnel authorized to subsist. Satellite facilities furnish AF Form 1650b, Manual
Sales (with backup data of AF Forms 79, DD Forms 1131, and cash) to the parent dining facility. Once
the day is closed, send the form to the Food Service office along with AF Forms 79.
     4.1.1. Guests at satellite Food Service locations order food from priced menus provided by the sup-
     porting dining facility. Meals may be consumed at the site or consumed away from the facility. Each
     person orders a meal and signs an AF Form 79. The Food Service manager certifies ESM and BAS
     status, completes the form, and collects the cash indicated from BAS personnel before providing the
     meal.
     4.1.2. The manager returns completed forms and cash to the supporting dining facility. Attach the
     forms as documentation of entries in the parent dining facility. Manual operations will input the sup-
     porting data on AF Form 1119-1. The parent facility will add AF Form 79 data on the consolidated
     DD Form 1131. Automated operations will input manual sales at the parent facility. Manual Sales
     Entry can be found in the CFS Handbook.
     4.1.3. Each unit, authorized by the combat support flight chief to use AF Form 79, establishes its
     requirements for the form through publication and distribution channels.

4.2. Manual Monthly Monetary Report. Use AF Form 1119-1, Manual Monthly Monetary Report,
at all manual locations to keep a daily standing of sales versus food cost. Close out the form as of the last
day of each accounting period. Send the form to the Food Service office. The Food Service officer or
superintendent will use the following crosscheck procedures:
     4.2.1. Column E, Total Sales. Column B + Column D = Column H
     4.2.2. EOM Total for Column E, Total Sales. Add the Column downward.
     4.2.3. Authorized Tolerance. Column H times 3 percent.
     4.2.4. Column I, Total Food Costs (theoretical)/Issues to Kitchen. Opening inventory or purchases +
     or – Column G – Column H, inventory value.
     4.2.5. Gain/(Loss). Column E (Total) – Column I.

4.3. Meals from a Dining Facility for Consumption Elsewhere.
     4.3.1. Two types of flight meals (small and large) are offered from a dining facility or a flight kitchen.
     This permits paying guests a choice of meal prices. The selling price is based on the current fiscal year
     DoD meal rates.
     4.3.2. If the combat support flight chief agrees it is not practical for individuals to pick up their own
     meals for consumption away from the dining facility, use the following procedures:
        4.3.2.1. The FSO provides written procedures to the requesting activity specifying the advance
        notice required, the menus available, and the time and location for pickup.
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                    15


       4.3.2.2. The noncommissioned officer in charge (NCOIC) of the activity requesting meals will:
           4.3.2.2.1. Give advance notice of the number and types of meals ordered as required by the
           FSO.
           4.3.2.2.2. Prepare an AF Form 79, indicating the name, grade, and meal card or SSN of each
           person who desires a meal and is authorized to eat at government expense. Indicate the spe-
           cific section and squadron requesting the meals in the organization block.
           4.3.2.2.3. Send the completed forms and money collected to the dining facility.
   4.3.3. The dining facility manager will:
       4.3.3.1. Review forms for accuracy and use to support entries on AF Forms 79.
       4.3.3.2. Instruct the person who picks up the meals to sign AF Forms 79 certifying receipt of the
       meals.
       4.3.3.3. Use the type of meals that are picked up to determine the cash collection rates and the
       meal credit allowances.

4.4. Fire Station Kitchens. If the mission support group commander decides food service will be pro-
vided at the fire station, the level of service will be hot meals for lunch and dinner seven days a week. The
FSO will establish and coordinate procedures to have food served on a schedule basis. These procedures
must be approved by USAF/ILV, Director of Services, before implementation.
   4.4.1. The facility manager will:
       4.4.1.1. Provide the menus to the fire chief each evening so firefighters can select menu items for
       the next day.
       4.4.1.2. Use a Food Service attendant to serve food as well as drive the vehicle to transport meals
       to the fire station.
       4.4.1.3. Provide the equipment necessary to transport food, including the vehicle. Under contract
       operations, the contractor may provide the vehicle.
   4.4.2. The Fire Chief will:
       4.4.2.1. Provide enough space for a serving area, ware-washing area, and a dining area.
       4.4.2.2. Maintain and secure the serving and dining areas during non-serving hours as required by
       the Director of Base Medical Services.
       4.4.2.3. Notify Food Service of menu choices at least two hours before the beginning of the serv-
       ing period.

4.5. Field Feeding Accounting Procedures. The field-feeding environment during exercises and at Ser-
vices Combat Training Sites (SCTS) no longer requires modified accounting and reporting procedures.
Use a special field ration meal allowance in lieu of a meal allowance. Use only one type of allowance for
the entire exercise or contingency operation. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF provides this allowance to the MAJ-
COM quarterly.
   4.5.1. The following procedures do not apply to field/contingency operations. These procedures
   apply to local base exercises only.
16                                                                          AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005


        4.5.1.1. Automated operations will transfer the food to an “AF Exercise” in Inventory Control
        (CFS). Input the name of the exercise in the remark section of the adjustment entry. The transfer is
        the beginning inventory for the exercise.
        4.5.1.2. During the exercise collect signatures and cash on AF Form 79, Headcount Record,
        which consolidates all types of meals for both Essential Station Messing (ESM) and cash custom-
        ers. This information will help the manager complete AF Form 1650b.
        4.5.1.3. At the end of the exercise, conduct a complete physical inventory. The total will be what
        you will transfer back in to the dining facility. Subtract the beginning inventory from the ending
        inventory and this will be the dollar value of what was used during the exercise. This total should
        also match the transfers. Take the transfer out and subtract the transfer in - the total should match
        what was used. Make sure the facility manager and NCOIC of the field feeding operation sign all
        the documentation (transfers).
        4.5.1.4. Take your cash collected, and AF Form 1650b for manually entering the data into the
        first sales day after the exercise. After the front of house EOD on the day you are manually enter-
        ing the exercise information, follow the guidance for manual sales entry in the CFS Handbook.
     4.5.2. SCTS and field/contingency will use a single copy of AF Form 1650b, Manual Sales on a
     weekly basis to recap the meals served. Post AF Form 1119-1, Manual Monthly Monetary Report
     weekly and the last day of each month.
     4.5.3. Each base Food Service activity conducting field feeding (whether part of a large scale exercise
     or contingency) will carry forward gains/losses each month throughout the fiscal year. The organiza-
     tion responsible for providing the subsistence and making purchases must submit AF Form 1119-1,
     Manual Monthly Monetary Report for the exercise/contingency, and then each month following,
     provide AF Form 1119-1 until either the gain/loss is zero, or the end of the fiscal year occurs. If no
     feeding occurs on subsequent months, only report the carryover and/or inventory on AF Form 1119-1.
     Investigate any gains/losses exceeding 3% of the total income versus purchases and forward the inves-
     tigation results with the AF Form 1119-1.
     4.5.4. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF must approve all requests for operational rations. Each base must use an
     80-digit Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) requisition format. Do
     not use base O&M funds to purchase operational rations.
     4.5.5. Use the dining facility Production Log, as the plan for food preparation.
     4.5.6. Use AF Form 35l4, Inventory Count Worksheet, to record weekly and monthly inventories.
     After the end of field exercises, return all unused rations in unopened cases to the supporting base
     activity.

4.6. Issuing Meals-Ready-to Eat (MRE) from Food Service.
     4.6.1. If another unit needs operational rations, food service purchases the rations and transfers them
     to the receiving unit using AF Form 3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer Sheet. One individual
     from that unit must sign for the rations, account for meals sold, and turn in remaining rations and
     paperwork to the Food Service office. Manual operations will complete the field accounting in accor-
     dance with (IAW) paragraph 4.5.1. If the unit does not return to the base providing the rations, the
     Food Service section at their home base completes the accounting and forwards through their MAJ-
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                17


   COM. Coordination between these units is essential to ensure all operational rations are accounted for
   properly.
   4.6.2. When MREs are used in local exercises by organizations other than Services, the following
   applies:
       4.6.2.1. The base FSO obtains MREs and puts them on AF Form 28, War Reserve Materiel
       (WRM) Ration Report (RCS: HAF-SV(M)9601. The FSO or designated representative trans-
       fers the rations from AF Form 28 to the requesting organization on AF Form 3516.
       4.6.2.2. The FSO provides the using organization with AF Forms 79 and current meal rates. The
       FSO advises the organization that the rations are accountable. When the exercise is concluded, all
       rations not documented as issued or sold on AF Form 79 must be immediately returned to Food
       Service, with the turn-in of cash collected and/or ESM signatures on AF Form 79.
       4.6.2.3. Once all meals, forms, and cash have been received, manual operations will complete AF
       Form 1119-1 to account for the use of meals during the exercise. For automated Food Service
       operations, input the manual sales in Inventory Control. Follow instructions in the CFS Handbook
       for Manual Sales Entry procedures.
   4.6.3. Account for individual meals (MREs) in Inventory Control for automated locations or AF
   Form 1119-1 for manual operations. Transfer whole cases of MREs to the AF Form 28.

4.7. Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MREs) Positioned on Aircraft for Emergency Purposes. The following
guidance is provided in the event MREs are required to be placed on Air Mobility Command (AMC) air-
craft for emergency consumption - i.e., aircraft diverted to a location without access to subsistence.
   4.7.1. Food Service will transfer the required MREs to the aircraft via AF Form 1297, Temporary
   Issue Receipt. If the MREs are consumed on the aircraft, the members will sign for them on an AF
   Form 79, Headcount Record. The individual who signs the AF Form 1297 must inform the members
   when issuing the MREs to claim them as government-furnished meals on their travel voucher so their
   per diem can be reduced accordingly.
   4.7.2. Upon return to home station or arrival at another Air Force base with a Food Service operation,
   the accountable individual will turn in the unused MREs, the AF Forms 79 and 1297, and the collected
   cash. The automated Food Service operation will receive all rations in as a transfer-in and then enter
   the sales manually in Inventory Control (instructions in the CFS Handbook.
   4.7.3. Do not charge MREs to organizational funds when issued for consumption or potential con-
   sumption. Members in TDY status receive per diem for travel days. Members must pay for the MREs
   or claim them on their travel voucher as a meal provided at no cost. If box lunches/MREs are issued
   to members on the processing line, they must pay for them.

4.8. MREs in Processing Lines. Members in TDY status receive per diem for travel days. Members
must pay for the MREs or claim them on their travel voucher as a meal provided at no cost. If box
lunches/MREs are issued to members on the line, they must pay for them. Orders must state Meals Pro-
vided at Government Expense. Members in Group Travel Status--Enlisted Members provide meals at
Government Expense--Officers/Civilians pay the Discount Rate. Remember the Finance Officer/Comp-
troller answers questions on entitlements. Please ensure you coordinate with the Accounting and Finance
Office (AFO).

                           CORPORATE FOOD SERVICE ACCOUNTING

5.1. Collection of Headcount. In automated operations, the cashier rings each customer through the
Point of Sales (POS) system. Sales, formerly known as earned income, are calculated based on food cost
for each item a customer purchases. ESM sales are also calculated based on food cost for each item the
customer chooses. Refer to paragraph 1.6. for computer malfunctions.

5.2. Sales Offset Report. Bases with one dining facility will print the Sales Offset Report from Aloha
Back Office. The report lists general ledger activity resulting from processed sales transactions for the
entire day. It also provides supporting documentation for the DD Form 1131. The manager must print this
report daily to verify the total dollar amount received at the registers. The report will be included as sup-
porting documentation for DD Form 1131.
     5.2.1. Cash Reconciliation Report. For bases with more than one operation, this report is available
     in Corporate Reporting (normally in superintendent/account office). Use the report to compare dol-
     lar amounts with deposit slips and cash register receipts. Print the report daily and attach to DD Form
     1131, Cash Collection Voucher. The Food Service Officer (FSO) must verify the proper amounts on
     DD Form 1131 at least monthly.

5.3. Sales Item List. This lists the item names, how each item is sold through the point-of-sales (POS),
and the selling price for each item. An item is sold either by a recipe or directly out of the inventory. The
manager should print this list monthly in case of computer malfunctions.

5.4. Sales and Cost Report (RCS: HAF-SV(M)0311. This report summarizes the results from pro-
cessed sales and item transactions. It lists sales, costs, gross profit amounts, and percentages for a variety
of meal periods. Managers will use this report to keep a daily standing of sales versus theoretical food
cost. Cost percentages should be between 75% and 85% (80% being the target). The CFS Handbook pro-
vides exact procedures for interpretation of this report. Food Service accountants must print this report
monthly.

5.5. Corporate Reporting. Corporate Reporting gathers data from all facilities on base and provides
centralized reporting for the Food Service superintendent or Food Service officer. The Food Service
officer or superintendent will use the Corporate Sales and Cost Report to determine the financial status of
the Food Service operation. Further, Corporate Reporting eliminates the need of manual printed reports
through automatic data roll-ups to HQ AFSVA/SVOHF. If a base does not report for more than seven
days, the facility manager will accomplish manual accounting procedures until the system is back on-line.

5.6. Uncosted Inventory Items Report. Uncosted on-hand quantities for inventory items result when
the system detects usage of an item that exceeds the on-hand inventory. This essentially means that you
have used products that are not accounted for in the inventory. (Selling more than what you actually have
on hand, according to the computer). Managers must review and take corrective action as defined in the
CFS Handbook at least daily.

5.7. Financial Summary. The food manager must try to keep each food account within three percent of
the total income versus total purchases.
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                  19


                                                Chapter 6

 ORDERING AND INVENTORY FOR ALL FOOD SERVICE OPERATIONS (DINING HALL,
           FLIGHT KITCHEN, CENTRAL PREP, AND FIELD FEEDING)

6.1. General Procedures:
   6.1.1. Full Food Service contract operations follow the procedures in the Performance Work State-
   ment (PWS).
   6.1.2. Military operations:
       6.1.2.1. The FSO designates in writing, by name and duty title, the persons responsible for the
       security of food in each facility.
       6.1.2.2. Storeroom personnel will weigh and count all food received, thawed, issued, or returned
       to the storeroom.
       6.1.2.3. Storeroom managers must ensure the code dates are posted for vendor items and that
       deliveries are checked for freshness and contract compliance. The storeroom manager requests
       assistance from the Military Public Health (MPH) inspector when necessary and advises the
       Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia (DSCP) account manager when the requirements of the con-
       tract are not met.
       6.1.2.4. Use base organizational Operations and Maintenance (O&M) funds (3400) to purchase
       ice; items such as paper products, plastic ware, charcoal or lighter fluid; and beverage dispensing
       equipment leasing and service. Do not use ESM funds to purchase these items.

6.2. Subsistence Evaluation. The dining facility manager documents and reports unsatisfactory subsis-
tence annually. Complete the survey found on Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) Subsistence
web site www.dscp.dla.mil/subs/pvsurvey/subsurv.htm. Print the screen before sending.
   6.2.1. If storeroom personnel experience problems throughout the year, contact the DSCP account
   manager within the region. If the problem is not resolved in a reasonable amount of time, contact the
   MAJCOM or HQ AFSVA/SVOHF. Make sure documentation of the problem, recommended solu-
   tions and point of contact is included in all requests.

6.3. Production Log. The Production Log dictates Food Service production. The facility manager com-
pletes a Production Log for each meal, based on the 14-day menu. The Production Log lists items to be
served for a particular meal, who will prepare the item, temperature checks, taste testing initials, recipe
numbers, sale item numbers, serving sizes and utensils used on the serving line, and progressive cooking
time and amounts. Use a separate Production Log for each meal and separate each short order, salad, and
pastry Production Log. Accurate information in this form is vital to ensure ordering and forecasting pro-
grams operate effectively.

6.4. Automated Ordering Procedures.
   6.4.1. For automated locations, order food from Prime Vendor using CFS automation. Prime Vendor,
   the DSCP account manager, and the Food Service staff set the schedule frequency for ordering and
   delivery of subsistence. Normal ordering timeframes are within 48-72 hours before the issue date.
20                                                                           AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005


     6.4.2. The storeroom manager will prepare a separate order for each type of vendor. The facility man-
     ager must ensure the headcount projected and quantities to prepare for the ordering period are accu-
     rate. In addition, the facility manager must verify order quantities before transmission to DSCP. Use
     the purchase order as the back dock receipt when receiving the subsistence. If food is purchased from
     the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), use the Government Purchase Card (GPC). See paragraph
     6.16. for more information on GPC use. Find exact automated ordering procedures in the CFS Hand-
     book.

6.5. Vendor and Inventory Items. Every item in the inventory has a six-digit number assigned to it.
Link all items in use to a Vendor Item contained in a vendor catalog. Some Inventory Items have multiple
Vendor Items. These are nested items such as Soda Fountain. DSCP assigns a 13-digit national stock
number (NSN) to each vendor’s product(s). At a minimum, DSCP sends the catalog via e-mail to all auto-
mated facilities weekly.
     6.5.1. The storeroom manager will ensure each inventory item number in use is linked to a vendor
     item number. Once a catalog is imported, the storeroom manager must verify the conversion for the
     purchase unit of measure for all linked items. Verify the effective date on all catalog imports by select-
     ing the “hide quote” button under vendor items.

6.6. Call Number. Inventory Control will automatically assign a reference number to every purchase
order. DSCP/STORES web assigns a call number to all orders processed through CFS automation. The
call number is used to track ESM subsistence expenditures from the time the food is ordered until the SF
1080, Voucher for Transfers Between Appropriations and/or Funds is paid.

6.7. Confirmations. STORES web will send an Order Confirmation via e-mail, showing the processed
order through DSCP’s automated system. Compare the order confirmation with the Purchase Order. The
manager will ensure the quantities ordered and prices match. Once the food is received, the storeroom
clerk will print out the Purchase Journal before processing the invoice. Once the facility manager veri-
fies and sends the invoice, STORES web will send a Receipt Confirmation. Storeroom managers must
check the dollar amounts and quantity of each line item match between the Receipt Confirmation and
the Purchase Journal. The storeroom manager will combine the purchase order, Order Confirmation,
vendor invoice, Purchase Journal, and Receipt Confirmation and forward all documentation within 24
hours to the Food Service accountant.

6.8. Cost Corrections. If the accountant finds any errors on the invoice entries, corrections must be
accomplished in the Inventory Control, Cost Corrections and on STORES web under receipt adjustments.
Refer to AFI 34-239, paragraph 5.7. for cost correction limitations.

6.9. Thaw Report. In automated operations, generate the thaw report using the Projected Sales Wizard.
Storeroom operations generate the report to meet requirements for the number of days identified and the
current 14 day cycle. The facility manager will ensure the headcount projected and quantities to prepare
for the ordering period are accurate.

6.10. Adjustment Entries. All adjustment entries are for the reduction of inventory. Production manag-
ers are responsible for entry of the raw and finished waste after each meal. Enter only those servings more
than five on the waste log.
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                     21


6.11. Manual Ordering Procedures.
   6.11.1. For installations without CFS, the type of communications available will determine how to
   order subsistence. For sites with Internet capability, order subsistence using STORES web. Find exact
   ordering procedures in the CFS Handbook.
   6.11.2. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF and the MAJCOM supporting the war fighting command is required to
   supply the Prime Vendor Catalog to all sites.
   6.11.3. Sites will use e-mail or fax for all orders. Storeroom clerks will use the catalog provided by
   HQ AFSVA/SVOHF. Prepare the quantities and names for items to order and forward to the HQ
   AFSVA/SVOHF. The HQ AFSVA/SVOHF will enter the information on STORES web. The dining
   facility manager will keep one copy to help in estimating future requirements.
   6.11.4. The Food Service representative must sign and retain a copy of the vendor invoice at the time
   of delivery of the food. Make sure the person requesting the food is not the same person who signs for
   the food when received. Enter the total dollar value of all purchases for the respective day in column
   F of AF Form 1119-1.
       6.11.4.1. Within 24 hours from the issue date make sure the facility manager forwards a copy of
       all items received with items priced and extended to the Food Service accountant. After the
       accountant reconciles, make any required changes to purchases, issues, and transfers. Forward all
       reconciled purchases to the Area of Responsibility (AOR) for bill payment.

6.12. Food Service Inventory Transfer Receipt. In non-automated operations, accomplish transfers
between and outside of Food Service facilities on AF Form 3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer
Receipt. This allows removal of food from one inventory and placed upon another (other appropriated
fund activities only). Also, use the form to send subsistence outside of Food Service (such as to a field
exercise) or return food to the Food Service system. It is essential that food transferred outside of the Food
Service system be adequately explained. For example, if food is transferred to a unit deploying to your
location, provide the name and location of the unit, and the quantity transferred. The receiving unit has the
responsibility for accounting for the food. By providing the name of the unit, the MAJCOM or HQ
AFSVA/SVFRS can track the expenditures.
   6.12.1. For automated operations, follow procedures as outlined in the CFS Handbook. For food that
   is transferred out to another automated facility, use Enter and Send Inter-Unit Transfers (Transfers
   OUT). For food that is brought in to the facility’s inventory, use the section referencing Transfers IN
   (Inter Unit Transfers).

6.13. Transfer Reconciliation. The accountant must run the Transfer Reconciliation Report from Cor-
porate Reporting daily to ensure all transfers are recorded on the same day for all facilities.

6.14. Inventory. Use AF Form 3514, Inventory Count Worksheet, to record the physical inventory of
food on-hand at non-automated operations. The inventory includes all food in the storerooms, refrigera-
tors, and freezers of the dining facilities and central preparation facilities, which is not prepared for con-
sumption. Include condiments previously removed from the storeroom, or opened containers, regardless
of issue or consumption dates. There are two types of inventory procedures:
   6.14.1. Weekly counts. Manual operations will count everything on-hand each week. Record the
   counts on AF Form 3514, Inventory Count Worksheet. Automated operations will only count those
22                                                                          AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005


     items defined by Corporate. Record those items on the Count Sheet within Physical Counts. Auto-
     mated operations will follow physical count procedures contained in the CFS Handbook. Before the
     Physical Count is processed, print the Edit List from Inventory Control. Conduct the inventory at the
     same time on the same day each week.
        6.14.1.1. Weekly counts will include condiments previously removed from the storeroom, or
        opened containers, regardless of issue or consumption dates. Do not count food items issued for
        advance preparation and prepared meals that may be consumed before the end of day processing.
     6.14.2. Monthly Counts. At the close of business on the last day of each month, the FSO assigns
     someone other than the storeroom personnel to conduct a physical inventory at each Food Service
     facility. The closing inventory of one period is the same as the opening inventory of the following
     period.
        6.14.2.1. Manual operations will enter the date and name of the person responsible for the Food
        Service account. Two copies and proper certification are required on all formal inventories, which
        are taken when the account is transferred. File one copy with AF Form 1119-1 and give either the
        second copy to the responsible person from whom the account is transferred or the Quality Assur-
        ance Personnel (QAP). One copy of the inventory is sufficient at all other times. Add a statement
        that the inventory is true and correct on the last page of AF Form 3514. The person who took the
        inventory signs the statement and the FSO certifies the inventory.
     6.14.3. Price items on the inventory at the prices listed at the time of receipt. If like items in stock
     were received at different prices, enter each quantity priced and extended at its own price.
     6.14.4. Automated operations will follow the same guidance as defined in paragraph 6.13. Record the
     physical counts on the monthly Count Sheets. The person performing the count will sign the Edit
     List Count Sheet, certifying the inventory is correct. The Food Service manager will also sign the
     Edit List Count Sheet.
     6.14.5. Once this process is completed, the Food Service manager in contract operations will print out
     two copies of the On Hand Summary Report (RCS: HAF-SVO(A)0304). The FSO will sign all the
     On Hand Summary Reports. Provide one copy to the Food Service accountant/QAP—the contractor
     will keep one copy. Non-Contract operations will print one copy of the monthly On Hand Summary
     Report (RCS: HAF-SVO(A)0304). The FSO will sign the On Hand Summary Report and file with
     the accountant.
     6.14.6. End of Year Inventory. Conduct the end of fiscal year inventory IAW AFI 34-239, paragraph
     5.6.

6.15. Inventory Levels. Peacetime inventory levels for main dining facilities are recommended to be
only $15K and smaller facilities to include flight feeding should be $10K. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF must
approve contingency and wartime inventory levels.

6.16. Government Purchase Card (GPC). The subsistence GPC is a credit card used to make pur-
chases from the commissary or other approved source at locations that can accept the card (CONUS),
some overseas locations). HQ AFSVA/SVOHF must approve any other local sources. Purchases on this
card are only for emergency purposes, when your normal subsistence provider cannot supply a needed
item. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF will approve all emergency GPC purchases if Defense Commissary Agency
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                  23


(DeCA) or the DSCP Prime Vendor cannot satisfy the requirement. Local contracting offices provide the
card and procedures.
   6.16.1. All purchases must be pre-approved by the unit’s Approving Official. The Approving Official
   must maintain an official GPC control log to issue control numbers to cardholders. Use this log to
   compare the value of purchases with the statement from the credit card company.
   6.16.2. Select food items and proceed to the cash registers for checkout. Do not exceed $2,500 per
   transaction limit or the approved monthly funding target of $5,000 per card. Use the GPC to finalize
   the purchase at the register. The cardholder then enters the value of the purchase on the control log.
   6.16.3. A Cardholder must be the FSO or dining facility manager. Contract personnel are not autho-
   rized to use the GPC for subsistence. In contract-managed operations, the Food Service QAP will be
   the authorized individual.

6.17. Purchase Reconciliation
   6.17.1. The FSO or a designated representative, such as the Quality Assurance Personnel (QAP) in
   full Food Service contract operations, must verify the total food purchases monthly with the SF 1080,
   Voucher for Transfers Between Appropriations and/or Funds. The accountant in all operations
   will use the SF 1080 spreadsheet or MAJCOM approved equivalent to record all purchases and any
   reconciliation. Automated operations will record the information from reconciling the receipt confir-
   mation and the purchase journal. Manual operations will use STORES web, Receipt Adjustments
   from the STORES web. Keep reconciliation documentation on file with all supporting documentation.
   6.17.2. The base Food Service accountant will work any discrepancies with the DSCP account man-
   ager. DFAS sends the credited SF 1080 and adjustment documents directly to the dining facility for
   verification and reconciliation.
   6.17.3. STORES web will automatically generate a receipt for the entire order on the fifth day after
   the required delivery date if a facility manager has not submitted a receipt for any line item on order.

                                CENTRAL PREPARATION KITCHENS

7.1. Central Pastry Kitchens. If the pastry kitchen is physically separated from other dining facilities, it
maintains its own accounting records. Use the pastry Production Logs for quantities to prepare.

7.2. Dining Facility Pastry Kitchens. A pastry kitchen operating as part of the dining facility account
controls food and transfers the finished pastry product to other facilities in Inventory Control, Adjust-
ment Entry (Transfer Out). They will not maintain separate accounting records. Manual operations will
transfer baked products to other facilities on AF Form 3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer Receipt.

7.3. Subsistence and Monetary Controls.
     7.3.1. At automated dining facilities, the recipe cost and selling price is calculated for individual por-
     tions of each menu item. Each price is based on current inventory item numbers and purchase prices.
     7.3.2. Inventory Levels. Inventory levels for Central Preparation Kitchens will not exceed $15K
     unless approved by HQ AFSVA/SVOHF.
     7.3.3. Physical Inventory. All inventories will be conducted IAW paragraph 6.14.
     7.3.4. Food Service Inventory Transfer Receipt. Manual operations will use AF Form 3516, Food
     Service Inventory Transfer Receipt to transfer pastry to other facilities. Automated operations will
     use Inventory Control, Adjustment Entry (Transfer Out). Instructions are located in the CFS Hand-
     book.
     7.3.5. Waste Logs. All automated pasty facilities will use a waste log to track discarded servings of
     five or more. Use Inventory Control, Adjustment Entry, raw or finished waste. Procedures for these
     functions are in the CFS Handbook.
     7.3.6. Local Purchase of Pastry Products. Local purchase of commercial pastry is prohibited unless
     approved by HQ AFSVA/SVOHF.

7.4. Pastry during AEF. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF must approve any procurement of commercial pastry
while personnel are in a contingency state. The waiver will only cover the timeframe of the deployment.

                                               Chapter 8

                                     FLIGHT MEAL SERVICE

8.1. Authorized Meal Service.
   8.1.1. Crewmembers. Normally, the duration of a flight should be in excess of three hours before a
   meal is authorized. Consider pre- and post-flight activity when determining if a meal is authorized.
   8.1.2. Passengers. Passengers may be furnished a meal if they are on a flight in excess of three hours.
   8.1.3. Patients. Air Force flight kitchen facilities prepare and issue regular flight meals for hospital
   patients aboard aero medical evacuation aircraft. The aero medical evacuation control officer from the
   installation medical facility obtains the modified diet items and special meals.

8.2. Expanded Flight Kitchens
   8.2.1. This facility is designed for authorized personnel working on the flight line or other work cen-
   ters on the installation. Menu items can range from hamburgers, fried chicken, hot dogs, French fries,
   soups, salads, baked items, chili, assorted beverages, pastry items, and various condiments.
   8.2.2. Expanded flight kitchens will use the Aloha front of the house or POS system to sell menu
   items other than the large and small menus.
   8.2.3. Expanded flight kitchen menus have been set in CFS and will be pushed from the ALOHA
   Inventory Control to the registers at the front of the house. Small and large menus are also preset and
   will be manually input at the end of the day. Use the FOH sales reports and cashier receipts to recon-
   cile cash turn-ins and give an account of all transactions (voids, surcharge, Essential Station Messing
   (ESM), and cash sales).
   8.2.4. Enter flight meals manually on the BOH, Inventory Control, under Sales Entry. Do not enter
   sales until after the FOH end-of-day has run.

8.3. Menu Patterns. The menu patterns for flight meals listed in the Air Force worldwide menu will be
followed, to include the Core Flight Meal Program. Sandwiches, salads, fruits, and vegetables will be
merchandised in transparent plastic containers. Expanded flight kitchens will follow menu patterns as
defined for dining facilities in the Preface to the Worldwide Menu.

8.4. Types of Flight Meals and Allowances. This information is in AFI 34-239, attachment 4. A mini-
mum of 2 hours is required for flight meal preparation. This is to ensure freshness of products and food
safety.

8.5. Reimbursements for Meals. Crewmembers and passengers normally pay cash for their meals.
   8.5.1. The Food Service accountant computes the cost of liquid coffee as follows: One pound of
   ground coffee yields 2.75 gallons of liquid coffee. The reimbursement rate for 2.75 gallons of bulk
   liquid coffee is the price of one pound of coffee plus the actual cost of cream and sugar furnished
   divided by 2.75. For example, $1.94 (for coffee) plus $0.194 (for cream and sugar) equal $2.134
   divided by 2.75 equals $0.776; adjusted to the nearest 5 cents is 80 cents per gallon.

8.6. Inventory Controls. All flight kitchen operations will follow guidance as referenced in Chapter 6.
26                                                                           AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005


     8.6.1. Monitor item quantities used to prepare meals and adjust menus as required to prevent exces-
     sive gain or loss. The FSO should make a random sample check of prepared meals at least weekly to
     prevent excessive variance between meal cost and the inventory allowance.

8.7. Request for Flight Meals. AF Form 79 provides a continuous record of flight meals requested and
cash collected. Use the form for refunds when meals are paid for but not consumed through no fault of the
passenger or crewmember.
     8.7.1. The traffic officer, operations officer, combat alert officer, aircraft commander (or designated
     representative), or the flight kitchen manager, completes AF Form 79 and collects money. The person
     who completes this form will notify the flight kitchen manager of the number of meals required.
     8.7.2. Flight kitchen personnel complete the form if passengers and crewmembers order individual
     flight meals from the flight kitchen.

8.8. Issue of Flight Meals.
     8.8.1. If flight kitchen personnel issue meals directly to passengers and crewmembers, the receiving
     personnel sign AF Form 79 to indicate receipt of the meals.
     8.8.2. If flight kitchen personnel issue meals to fleet or passenger service for delivery to aircraft,
     record the number and type of meals on AF Form 3516. Keep one copy as a supporting document and
     give a copy to fleet service personnel.
     8.8.3. Air Mobility Command (AMC) Cold Banner and Special Assignment Airlift Missions
     (SAAM). Cold banner refers to any mission, which supports or is directed by the President of the
     United States. SAAM refers to any mission directed as a special assignment airlift mission by AMC.
     On request, flight kitchens furnishing flight meal support will issue flight meals or bulk issue items for
     preparation aloft without reimbursement.
        8.8.3.1. The flight kitchen will take full credit on AF Form 79. Aircraft number and home base are
        indicated on AF Forms 3516 and 79. The loadmaster acknowledges receiving the meals by signing
        AF Form 3516. The support base Food Service sends one copy of AF Form 3516 to the FSO at the
        home base where the flight originated.
        8.8.3.2. Cash collections for meals are made when the meals are served. The loadmaster may turn
        in cash collected and unused meals at the main overnight base Food Service, if desired. The load-
        master turns signature sheets, cash, and unused meals (or receipts for cash and meals) in to the
        home base. The home base flight kitchen supervisor verifies the number of meals issued and used.
        Accountability will be maintained for all meals during the entire mission.

8.9. Cash Controls. The flight kitchen manager must:
     8.9.1. Make sure the current flight meal supplement, snack meal, and bulk liquid beverage reimburse-
     ment rates are collected from guests.
     8.9.2. Provide safeguards for the change fund and cash collected.
     8.9.3. At passenger terminals where fleet service collects a considerable amount of cash from the sale
     of flight meals, cash will be deposited directly with accounting and finance. The passenger service
     officer will prepare DD Form 1131 in sufficient copies to provide the FSO with a copy for reconcilia-
     tion with the AF Form 79. AFO and the person turning in the funds must verify and sign the forms.
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                  27


   The flight kitchen manager will ensure the DD Form 1131 is turned-in within seven (7) days. A
   Report of Survey is required after 30 days.

8.10. Cash Refund Procedures for Flight Meals. Passengers and crewmembers may receive refunds
for meals and snacks purchased but not consumed, due to circumstances beyond their control. For exam-
ple, flights may be delayed or canceled, meals may not be served because of equipment failure, or meals
may not be delivered to the aircraft.
   8.10.1. Before a refund is made, the aircraft commander or loadmaster must certify that meals were
   not served. The passenger service officer or designated representative will:
       8.10.1.1. Complete the refund certificate on the passenger's boarding pass or ticket receipt.
       8.10.1.2. Give the reason for refund and include any pertinent information (for example: flight
       canceled, second meal not placed in aircraft at originating station, passenger bumped off flight,
       etc.).
       8.10.1.3. Sign the certificate.
   8.10.2. The passenger completes the refund data on the reverse side of AF Form 79. Annotate the rea-
   son for the refund in the explanation for refunds. Refunds of the amount paid may be made at the orig-
   inating or terminating passenger terminal facility, or flight kitchen. One crewmember can sign for
   refunds of the entire crew meal order. To support cash refunds to passengers and crewmembers, AF
   Form 79 must be attached to the file copy of DD Form 1131 submitted to accounting and finance.
   8.10.3. If crewmembers and passengers do not receive purchased bulk liquid beverages; they may
   receive reimbursement by presenting a signed statement of non-receipt from the aircraft commander
   to the passenger terminal cashier or flight kitchen. In addition, the person receiving the refund must
   sign the back of AF Form 79. AF Form 79, with the aircraft commander's signed statement of
   non-receipt attached, must be attached to the file copy of DD Form 1131 submitted to accounting and
   finance.
   8.10.4. The above procedures permit refunds for flight meals at a different base than where the collec-
   tion was made.

8.11. Unsafe Food Items. If a flight kitchen manager suspects food items are unfit for human consump-
tion or unsafe for service in flight, have Military Public Health (MPH) inspect the items. If the MPH con-
demns the items, the manager completes the AF Form 3516, in duplicate, as follows:
   8.11.1. In the consignee block of the form enter the word "Condemned" and add the following certif-
   icate "I certify the food items listed above are unsafe for flight Food Service or human consumption
   and are not to be used for flight meals."
   8.11.2. The MPH inspector will sign this certificate. The flight kitchen will certify the final disposi-
   tion of all condemned items on AF Form 3516 before dropping the dollar amount from the inventory.
   The flight kitchen will keep the original as a supporting document and the MPH inspector will keep
   the second copy.
   8.11.3. At automated locations, in order to remove items from the inventory, the facility manager will
   make the necessary adjustment entries in accordance with the CFS Handbook, Enter and Process
   Adjustments (Daily Waste). Manual operations will annotate the transfer in column G of AF Form
   1119-1.
28                                                                           AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005


8.12. Excess or Surplus Flight Meals Aboard Military Aircraft. Fleet service must turn over to the
flight kitchen excess or surplus flight meals from transient or terminating mission aircraft. In the absence
of a flight kitchen, turn them in to a dining facility. The flight kitchen or dining facility makes disposition
as indicated below:
     8.12.1. The FSO prepares an AF Form 3516 (in duplicate) to receipt for all meals received (frozen,
     spoiled, or thawed) and requests inspection by the MPH inspector. The FSO who receives the meals
     signs both copies of AF Form 3516. The loadmaster or flight traffic specialist keeps the original and
     the FSO keeps the duplicate as a supporting document.
     8.12.2. After the MPH inspector determines if the food is fit for human consumption, the MPH
     inspector will annotate the AF Form 3516 with a recommendation for disposal.
     8.12.3. In all cases, the MPH inspector determines the fitness and use of precooked frozen meals, as
     well as any other questionable food item.
     8.12.4. Turn-ins or write-offs of surplus meals will be accompanied by the original AF Form 3516
     issued to the loadmaster or flight traffic specialist. The flight kitchen manager uses current prices for
     Meals Cooked, Frozen (MCF), or flight meal components available at the receiving flight kitchen. If
     prices are unavailable there, the manager will use prices from the originating base's AF Form 3516.

8.13. Unused Food Aboard Military Aircraft. Fleet service will return all unused bulk subsistence
items to the flight kitchen. In the absence of a flight kitchen, return the items to the dining facility. The
Food Service person who receives the food items prepares AF Form 3516. The recipient signs both cop-
ies. Fleet service keeps the original and the MPH inspector keeps the duplicate as a supporting document.
After the MPH inspector certifies food items to be fit for human consumption, add all food items (except
condemned) to the storeroom inventory.

8.14. Flight Meal Questionnaire. Use AF Form 27, Food Service Customer Survey, base, or MAJ-
COM approved form to get feedback from your guests. Forms can be used in conjunction with all meals
available in the flight kitchen. Ensure a return address is placed on the reverse side of the form. In addi-
tion, make forms available to all flight kitchen guests. The flight kitchen manager should respond to
guest’s concerns, usually with a telephone call. Make notes of the conversation on the backside of the
form used and file for future reference.

8.15. Flight Meals Prepared in Dining Facilities. If the flight kitchen operates as part of a dining facil-
ity, the FSO must report separately for the flight meal account on AF Form 79. Record food issued from
the facility storeroom to the flight kitchen using Manual Sales Entry for a co-located operation. Exact
procedures are in the CFS Handbook. Manual operations will record flight meals on AF Form 1119-1.

8.16. Transportation Working Capital Fund (TWCF). Passenger service representatives will provide
complimentary snacks and beverages (paid for by the TWCF), which will enhance passenger comfort dur-
ing flight to all passengers on a no charge basis. Complimentary snacks are not intended to be provided in
lieu of a meal and must not exceed 75 cents per passenger.
     8.16.1. Purchasing Food for Beverages and Snacks. Passenger service representatives may use
     TWCF to purchase subsistence items for beverages and snacks from flight kitchens on a reimbursable
     basis. The Air Terminal manager (ATM) determines the types and quantities of beverages and snacks
     needed. The cost of such items should not exceed 75 cents per passenger. The ATM should coordinate
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                    29


   with the local FSO and the accounting and finance office to establish procedures to receive bulk pur-
   chased beverages and snacks. Passenger service representatives will request bulk beverage and snack
   items on AF Form 79, which will be signed by the ATM or designated representative. The ATM will
   certify the bulk item receipt by signing in the signature block and inserting the words "TWCF PAS-
   SENGER MISSION" above the signature.
   8.16.2. Non-AMC Terminal Activities. At installations where there is no AMC terminal activity, the
   aircrew will identify to the local flight kitchen the proper billing address for beverages and snacks
   needed to support the TWCF passenger mission. The billing address will be the accounting and
   finance office of the aircraft's home station.
   8.16.3. Billing Instructions. Each flight kitchen must maintain a monthly record of all issued and
   creditable returned items. Each month the FSO will furnish the accounting and finance officer AF
   Form 3515, Cross Service Billing showing issues less creditable returns.
   8.16.4. Authorized Monetary Allowance. The cost of complimentary snacks is limited to a maximum
   of 75 cents per passenger. Do not include complimentary beverages (coffee or tea) in this limit. List
   unused snack and individually containerized beverage items on AF Form 3516 and turn in the items to
   the flight kitchen. Flight kitchens originating TWCF complimentary snacks and beverage service will
   provide the loadmaster with two AF Forms 3516, to aid turn in at the terminating station. Receiving
   flight kitchens will use current prices available at their installation when adding TWCF complimen-
   tary snacks and beverages to their inventory. If prices are unavailable locally, use the prices from the
   originating base's AF Form 3516.
   8.16.5. Determining Requirements. Normally the ATM determines requirements for complimentary
   snacks and beverage requirements on the period of flight (morning, afternoon, evening), duration of
   flight, meal service availability, food item availability, and other local controlling factors. Flights of
   less than 90 minutes are authorized TWCF complimentary beverages only. Flights over 90 minutes
   are authorized TWCF complimentary snacks and beverages. The ATM bases complimentary snacks
   and beverages on food items normally stocked by the local flight kitchen. The flight kitchen will not
   include major meal items, such as sandwiches, soups, or entrees, as complimentary snack items. Sam-
   ple selections of snacks are listed in the preface to the Air Force worldwide menu.

8.17. Fleet and Passenger Services. If flight kitchen personnel issue meals to fleet or passenger service
for delivery to aircraft, record the number and type of meals on the AF Form 3516. Keep one copy as a
supporting document and give a copy to fleet or passenger service. Fleet/Passenger Service representative
and flight kitchen personnel must sign the AF Form 3516.
   8.17.1. Flight kitchen personnel must maintain a copy of the AF Form 79 provided by fleet and pas-
   senger service, once all transactions are complete.
   8.17.2. Fleet and passenger service representatives are responsible for cash turn-in to Accounting and
   Finance. They will complete DD Form 1131 in sufficient copies to provide the Food Service Officer/
   Flight Kitchen manager with a copy for reconciliation with AF Form 79.
   8.17.3. Manually enter the number and type of flight meals through the Sales Entry function (item
   sales tab) of CFS using the AF Form 3516 as your source of meals and supplements issued. This
   action will reduce the flight kitchen inventory. NOTE: There will be a remaining dollar amount in the
   sales day totals, place this amount in the Balance of Day.
30                                                                         AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005


     8.17.4. Once the DD Form 1131 is received the dollar amount will be added to Sales Offset for cur-
     rent days transactions. (Sales Day Totals will not balance; the remaining amount will be placed in Bal-
     ance of Day). AF Form 3516 will support balance the day amounts.
     8.17.5. If the remaining dollar amount in the sales days totals exceeds $10, the facility manager must
     provide the MAJCOM with supporting documentation which explains the excessive dollar amount.

8.18. Mission Essential Beverages (Liquid Coffee/Tea or Hot Chocolate) for ESM. A p p r o p r i a t e d
funds may not be used to provide free beverages to military or civilian employees. Members who meet the
requirements are those who are exposed to the elements for extended periods, have no reasonable access
to refreshment sources, and where beverages are required to remain alert are authorized mission essential
beverages provided at government expense using 3500 Appropriation for Subsistence in Kind funds. For
example, Security Force personnel who are manning gates and guard posts and Civil Engineering person-
nel who are involved in snow removal or work locations where there is no reasonable access to refresh-
ment sources to remain alert. All other personnel would be required to pay for coffee or other beverages
provided by Air Force dining facilities.
     8.18.1. The following procedures apply when requesting mission essential beverages from Air Force
     dining facilities:
        8.18.1.1. The Officer/NCOIC of the activity requiring the beverage will prepare an AF Form 79,
        indicating the name, grade, and the last 3-digits of the SSAN of each person who desires bever-
        ages. The OIC/NCOIC must annotate their signature, rank, and duty phone in the remark section
        of the form. Provide the completed form to the dining facility manager/representative. The actual
        person, who is picking up the beverages, must sign in the block “signature and Grade of Person
        Making Collection.”
        8.18.1.2. The unit requiring the beverages will be responsible for providing the container to trans-
        port the beverage. This procedure will not be used to provide beverages to command posts, unit
        work areas, sales of sports beverages, or field exercises to include search and recovery. HQ
        AFSVA/SVOHF must approve any other unique circumstances.
        8.18.1.3. The dining facility manager/representative will provide the liquid beverage in containers
        provided by the requesting organization.
        8.18.1.4. The dining facility/flight manager will sell the beverage in 1/2-gallon (brewed) liquid
        increments (No coffee grounds or dry products will be dispensed). Automated operations will use
        the adjustment entries; transfer out to HQ AFSVA/Mission Essential Beverages (#200109). The
        dollar amount will not exceed $.75 (cents) per person authorized. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF will
        review this weekly to ensure bases do not exceed the authorized amounts.
        8.18.1.5. The dining facility/flight kitchen manager will turn-in the completed form to the food
        service accountant with a copy of the transfer document.
     8.18.2. Sports beverages (Gatorade) used as mission essential beverages. Bases will not use the 3500
     Appropriation for Subsistence-in-Kind fund to purchase sports beverages. Purchase sports beverages
     using Organizational (O&M) funds. Organizations must comply with the Air Force Surgeon General
     (AFMOA/CC) memo dated 3 Jul 01 and AFI 65-601V1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, paragraph
     4.45.6 Sports Beverages.
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                31

   funded.

9.4. Responsibilities. The FSO/superintendent is responsible for:
   9.4.1. Participating in planning and programming by personally visiting the base plans office at least
   annually with the Services commander to jointly review the type and quantity of WRM rations to be
   stocked per WCDO and OPLANS. The FSO/superintendent must have a security clearance before
   being permitted to view these documents.
       9.4.1.1. Participating in policies established by the base War Reserve Materiel Officer (WRMO).
   9.4.2. Maintaining accountability for WRM assets by:
32                                                                         AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005


        9.4.2.1. Maintaining a copy of the MAJCOM WRM funded level ration requirements letter spec-
        ifying the quantities of WRM operational rations that are funded by HQ AFSVA/SVO.
        9.4.2.2. Ensuring the approved WRM funded level is not exceeded at anytime.
        9.4.2.3. Maintaining accurate records for WRM and peacetime operational rations. An AF Form
        28 should be maintained by date of pack and lot number. Report all (WRM and peacetime) opera-
        tional rations on the same AF Form 28 monthly.
        9.4.2.4. Approving the accuracy of the monthly AF Form 28 by reviewing and signing the form.
        A copy of the completed form will be provided to the base WRM monitor.
     9.4.3. Ensuring proper storage, adequate security, and replacement of WRM assets by:
        9.4.3.1. Storing under refrigeration where feasible.
        9.4.3.2. Making sure rations on-hand receipts stored by self sustaining units are replaced annu-
        ally.
        9.4.3.3. Following prescribed procedures for issues, transfers, and other dispositions of WRM
        subsistence.
        9.4.3.4. Using storage facilities, which provide adequate security and proper storage conditions
        for WRM subsistence.
     9.4.4. Ensuring that WRM subsistence assets are inspected by MPH by:
        9.4.4.1. Identifying to the MPH office the date of pack, lot number, and inspection test date (ITD)
        of all rations on-hand in the warehouse and new acquisitions upon receipt.
        9.4.4.2. Notify MPH when follow-up inspections are due based on inspection documents pro-
        vided by inspectors from each inspection performed.

9.5. Replacement of Operational Rations. DSCP limits activities to placing only one requisition per
year for direct vendor delivery (DVD) of MREs and UGRs. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF will requisition opera-
tional rations annually to replace older stocks and fund new requirements that are to be maintained as
WRM stocks at base level.
     9.5.1. The manufacturer will date stamp each case of operational rations reflecting an appropriate
     date of pack and lot number.
     9.5.2. The manufacturer will date stamp the suggested inspection test date (ITD) on each case of oper-
     ational rations. Periodic inspections and evaluations by the local MPH inspector will determine the
     proper ITDs.
     9.5.3. Under normal conditions, MREs have an estimated shelf life of 36 months un-refrigerated.
     Under refrigerated conditions (35F-50F degrees), the shelf life may be extended to a maximum of 5
     years. The latter should be used where feasible. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF will plan on replacing/rotating
     all WRM rations on an annual basis.
     9.5.4. Any shortages in the WRM account below current funded levels must be replaced within 30
     days. This is usually caused by release of WRM stocks by the Services Commander for exercises, etc.
     9.5.5. All requisitions for WRM replacements will contain project code 121 and advice code 2G.
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                   33


   9.5.6. DVD MREs will be placed in WRM stocks upon receipt. Those operational rations stored are
   separate from WRM stocks. The disposition of these rations remains the same. That is, either issued
   for exercises or turned in to Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO). They should be
   monitored closely to ensure they do not exceed their shelf life. Always issue oldest stocks first based
   on the date of pack.
   9.5.7. Ideally, Food Service operations should always have their funded level of WRM MREs
   on-hand. However, should there be a requirement or if consumption exceeds the on-hand quantity,
   DSCP will meet those needs from depot stocks.
       9.5.7.1. Depot stocked MREs are older dates of pack and were previously held in refrigerated
       storage. They will normally expire within 12-18 months after removal from cold storage.
       9.5.7.2. Units or organizations requiring rations for exercises, etc., should provide their require-
       ments to the FSO allowing sufficient lead-time for requisitioning depot stocked MREs, preferably
       30 days for CONUS and 45-60 days for OCONUS.
       9.5.7.3. Food Service activities will requisition rations for all active duty units or organizations.
       ANG and AF Reserve units will requisition rations for their respective units through HQ AFSVA/
       SVOHF. AF Food Service will forward all requisitions to DSCP with an information copy to each
       base/unit.
       9.5.7.4. The Services commander or the appointed (in writing) designated representative must
       approve by signing AF Form 3516 for rations that impact on WRM stock levels prior to issue. No
       requisitions will be placed or issues made without this approval.
       9.5.7.5. All requisitions for depot stocked MREs will bear project code 384 (identifies the items
       as other than WRM). Advice code 2J will be used on these requisitions.
       9.5.7.6. Should an issue of any WRM stocks be made for use during disasters, deployments, or
       emergencies not otherwise covered by HQ USAF OPLANS, replace these stocks according to the
       above guidance. However, should WRM support be seriously impaired, the base WRM monitor
       will coordinate with HQ AFSVA/SVOHF on replacing those stocks sooner with current date of
       pack rations.
   9.5.8. Operational rations issued by Food Service for unit use during exercises, alerts, etc., may be
   returned to Food Service within 72 hours after termination of the exercise or alert providing the fol-
   lowing conditions are met:
       9.5.8.1. MPH must inspect rations and certify the rations as still fit for their intended purpose
       before returning to Food Service. Certification must accompany the rations returned to Food Ser-
       vice.
       9.5.8.2. The Food Service facility has a valid demand or future need for the rations.
       9.5.8.3. Partial cases of MREs that are to be reassembled in case lots must approximate the origi-
       nal menus as closely as possible. A maximum of two reassembled cases will be accepted at any
       occurrence. Food Service should indicate the oldest date of pack for the reassembled menus.
       9.5.8.4. List all rations returned to Food Service on AF Form 3516.

9.6. Stock Replacement. Maintain an AF Form 28 for each type of operational ration, date of pack, and
lot number. These records will provide information for stock replacement before the shelf life date. The
34                                                                           AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005


AF Form 28 will be annotated to reflect the latest ITD by date of pack and lot number as determined by
MPH. In addition, record the quantity of each issue of WRM operational rations on the AF Form 28
(include unit issued to). All postings to the AF Form 28 such as transfers, receipts, etc., will be made when
the transaction occurs. Check the AF Form 28 balances against the actual inventory balances monthly, to
ensure that accurate reporting is being made to higher headquarters. The entire balance from the previous
month will be the beginning balance for the new month (current). Replacement of WRM rations will be
made annually.
     9.6.1. Ensure you consult with MPH to determine the proper or extended ITDs. This may require a
     change due to local climatic conditions and storage facilities used. If MPH evaluation requires a
     change to ITDs, ensure that the changes are properly recorded on AF Form 28. MPH will mark at least
     four boxes per pallet or insert at least one placard per pallet reflecting the shortened or extended ITDs.
     Food Service personnel must ensure MPH places a placard or stamps the required number of cases to
     indicate the rations were inspected. The shortened or extended ITDs must be marked on the cases or
     placard. MPH will provide a letter to the FSO certifying the shortened or extended ITDs by lot num-
     bers. This also applies to pre-positioned WRM rations that are stored elsewhere on the base or by
     self-sustaining units.
     9.6.2. Post shortened or extended ITDs on the appropriate AF Form 28.
     9.6.3. Transfer operational rations to other bases at least one year before shelf life date or the most
     recent ITD. MPH inspection reports must accompany all shipments and faxed to the receiving base
     and HQ AFSVA/SVOHF before shipment.
     9.6.4. Rotate operational rations by using rations for at least one meal a day during training, field
     exercises, or base alerts before shelf life date or most recent ITD. The plans officer will coordinate
     with the installation commander, Services Commander, and other concerned officials for use of oper-
     ational rations during local exercises, alerts, ORIs, etc.
     9.6.5. Replace operational rations held by self-sustaining units annually with newer dates of pack
     rations.
     9.6.6. Turn-in operational rations that are four years or older if un-refrigerated to the servicing
     DRMO. Contact HQ AFSVA/SVOHF for approval before turn-in. Rations to be turned in to DRMO
     must have 90 days or more shelf life remaining at the time of turn in.

9.7. Storage of WRM Rations. Ideally, operational rations should be stored under refrigeration
(35F-50F degrees) to extend ration shelf life. In some situations, this may not be feasible and rations must
be stored in un-refrigerated facilities. However, this decreases the shelf life when storage is above 50F
degrees.
     9.7.1. Each MAJCOM is responsible for programming Military Construction Program (MCP)
     projects for storage of WRM rations and should include refrigeration to prolong ration shelf life. If
     facilities are inadequate for storage of WRM rations, the FSO must work closely with the Services
     Commander in identifying and getting adequate facilities programmed for storage of WRM rations.
     The same applies for Materials Handling Equipment (MHE) required.
     9.7.2. Should current facilities be inadequate for storage of WRM rations, the installation commander
     should be contacted to provide space elsewhere on base to store the rations. The facility provided
     should be under lock and key control of the FSO. Further, the facility must provide adequate security
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                      35


   measures. If storage facility is joint use, a chain link fence must be erected from floor to ceiling to pre-
   vent theft of rations.
   9.7.3. Upon receipt of annual replacement rations, place the new WRM rations in WRM. This
   replacement will also include rations issued on hand receipt to self-sustaining units.
   9.7.4. Transfer rations for medical sampling from the WRM account in full case lots. The DD Form
   1222, Request for And Results of Tests will be provided by MPH to Food Service personnel.
   9.7.5. Issue of rations from the WRM account will not be made. All rations for issue must be made
   from the Food Service account. If adequate rations are not available in Food Service and some WRM
   rations must be used, they are transferred to Food Service prior to issue. Release of WRM rations must
   be approved by the Services commander or designated representative in coordination with the base
   War Reserve Material Officer (WRMO).
   9.7.6. OCONUS bases will report quantities, which cannot be used locally to the applicable MAJ-
   COM. The MAJCOM will attempt to redistribute rations to other bases within their command and
   budget for transportation costs for second destination movement of those rations to where they will be
   used.
   9.7.7. MAJCOMs will contact HQ AFSVA/SVOHF for instructions on disposition of operational
   rations. The MAJCOM will attempt to redistribute operational rations to other bases within the MAJ-
   COM first. Rations will not be transferred from base to base without MAJCOM and HQ AFSVA/
   SVOHF approval and must be inspected by MPH.
   9.7.8. HQ AFSVA/SVOHF directed movement of operational rations will be transferred from the
   shipping Food Service account and received in the Food Service account at the receiving base.

9.8. Accountability for Pre-positioned Rations. Accountability for pre-positioned WRM rations
remains with the FSO until they are used, lost, stolen, etc. Self-sustaining units may be authorized to store
WRM rations at certain locations. WRM rations in this category are issued on an AF Form 1297, Tempo-
rary Issue Receipt, according to AFI 34-239, attachment 7. Accountability for these rations remains with
the FSO until the rations are consumed by the using activity.
   9.8.1. Operational rations should be used by the FSO for feeding one meal a day during training, field
   exercises, or during base alerts as a substitute for a flight meal or as carryout meals.

9.9. Survival Food Packets. Survival Food Packets are not considered a WRM item. Survival food
packets required for inclusion in survival kits aboard aircraft will not be stocked by the FSO. The using
organizations (life support) will obtain these packets by submitting a requisition directly to DSCP. Food
Service requirements for training or survival school will indicate an ESM fund cite. Quantities requested
will be adjusted to full cases. Food packets, which are more than 48 months old from date of pack, should
not be issued for use in survival kits. If survival food packets are received from a DSCP depot that are
more than 48 months old (determined by the date of pack), they will be inspected by MPH for condition.
Food packets in good condition will be turned into DRMO and a discrepancy report will be submitted to
DSCP Operational Rations, Assembly Section, DSCP/HRAA. Dispose of food packets in unusable con-
dition to refuse collection and submit a discrepancy report to DSCP/HRAA.

9.10. Canned/Pouch Drinking Water. Canned/Pouch drinking water is not considered a WRM item.
Units that require canned/pouch drinking water may submit a requisition to DSCP for the quantity of
36                                                                          AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005


canned/pouch water they desire. The unit is responsible for storage. The FSO is not authorized to maintain
or store canned/pouch drinking water.

9.11. Unitized Group Rations. UGRs are the primary Air Force wartime menu and must be used during
all exercises and contingencies. Limited deviations may be authorized for those items that are out of stock
in DSCP depots. Installation commanders should be made aware of this stipulation.

9.12. Purchase of Water using O&M Monies. AFI 65-601, Vol I, 21 Oct 94, Budget Guidance and
Procedures, provides direction for purchasing water. Air Force organizations may purchase drinking
water with Appropriated Funds (O&M) only when it is a necessary expense for the government as fol-
lows:
     9.12.1. The public water supply is unsafe for human consumption.
     9.12.2. There is an emergency failure of the water source on the installation.
     9.12.3. A temporary facility has no drinking water available without cost or at a lower cost to the gov-
     ernment.
     9.12.4. The 3500 Appropriation for Subsistence In Kind fund can only be used to support beverages
     that are part of a meal limited to 12 oz per meal. SAF/FMB ruling states that in no case should ESM
     funds be used to purchase beverages for operational use, unless reimbursed. AF Flight Kitchens can
     sell bottled water through a bulk sale if approved for emergency purposes. The flying unit that
     requires water must have an approved funding document from the Unit Resource Advisor. The Flight
     Kitchen will issue the water on AF Form 3516, Food Service Inventory Transfer Sheet. The Flight
     Kitchen will attach the funding document to AF Form 3515, Cross Service Billing. This will allow the
     comptroller to transfer the monies to the ESM account.
AFMAN34-240 2 MAY 2005                                                                                   37

     BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL AND CONVENTIONAL DEFENSE OPERATION AND
                   STANDARDS (NBCC) FOR FOOD SERVICE

10.1. Services. The primary focus of Services personnel is to ensure continuity of operations and to
protect personnel from contamination. Services procedures will focus on the area of food service.
   10.1.1. Food and Potable Water Considerations:
       10.1.1.1. There is currently no acceptable means to decontaminate food-packaging material.
       Therefore, Services personnel will take all the precautionary steps to safeguard and protect food
       assets during the pre-attack period and use existing processes to order new stocks of food
       10.1.1.2. Services personnel should disperse food assets into fixed or hardened shelters or sealed
       refrigeration units. Cover with plastic and seal with tape. Once the attack is over, request Civil
       Engineer readiness to test the protected food to identify the contamination and determine if the
       protected food is contamination free. Air Force Public Health will determine if the food is safe
       and wholesome for consumption.
       10.1.1.3. Institute shelter stocking with pre-positioned operational rations, such as Meals
       Ready-to-Eat (MRE) nad Unitized Group Rations (UGR). Stock only those shelters in an over
       pressurized environment (personnel can safely remove mask).
       10.1.1.4. Upon notification of hostilities, work the normal food supply chain to immediately
       restock and resupply sustaining forces with either in-theater or out of theater clean food assets. To
       accomplish this MAJCOM and Services Agency staff will work with in-theater personnel to
       determine salvageable and reusable assets and to reorder requirements for MRE and UGR.
       10.1.1.5. Do not use contaminated food service equipment. Instead, relocate new bare base assets
       from other sites within the theater or from stateside locations. Until that time, personnel will eat
       clean operational rations.
       10.1.1.6. If new science and/or technologies permit the safe decontamination of certain food
       packaging systems; revise decontamination procedures accordingly.
