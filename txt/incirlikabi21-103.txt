SUMMARY OF CHANGES

Added vehicle and qualified driver requirements for 39 Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS).
Added Aerospace Ground Equipment section requirements for 39 MXS/Aerospace Ground
Equipment Section (MXMG). Added Crash Damaged Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR)
procedures for Geographically Separated Units (GSU). Added 39 MXS coordination
procedures with 39 Comptroller Squadron for funding of leased crane. Corrected minor
typographical errors evident in previous edition. Added 414 Expeditionary Reconnaissance
Squadron (ERS) MQ-1B Predator requirements.
1. General
     1.1. In-flight or ground emergencies involving aircraft require prompt, coordinated actions
     from many agencies to prevent unnecessary loss of life, damage to equipment or interference
     with other flying operations. This instruction is not intended to replace detailed guidance
     given by technical orders, other instructions or regulations, but rather to serve as a
     coordination tool to ensure all agencies are aware of their responsibilities during aircraft
     emergency situations.
     1.2. Only required vehicles and personnel will respond to aircraft emergencies (with Ultra
     High Frequency (UHF) radios if available). Vehicles will position themselves behind
     responding crash vehicles and not impede movement or vision. In addition, only authorized
     agencies may operate on the Crash Net. Personnel not required to respond will clear the area
     so as not to interfere with emergency operations. If necessary, the Senior Fire Officer (SFO)
     or Incident Commander (IC) will direct the Security Forces to clear the area of non-essential
     personnel.
     1.3. During initial response to an aircraft emergency, the SFO is the IC and will determine if
     the aircraft is safe prior to releasing the aircraft for maintenance or recovery. Until the
     aircraft has been released by the IC, no one will approach the aircraft without direction from
     the IC. All vehicles, except Fire Department vehicles, will remain clear of the aircraft. This
     does not prohibit essential vehicles (such as tugs) from positioning themselves nearby for
     immediate use. The IC must release the aircraft or direct specific actions before any vehicles,
     other than Fire Department vehicles, approach the aircraft. This restriction does not prevent
     emergency actions prior to Fire Department arrival.
     1.4. For emergencies involving a prior-announced barrier engagement, all response vehicles
     (except Fire Department and crash recovery vehicles) and non-essential vehicles will remain
     clear of emergency aircraft until Fire Department and crash recovery actions are complete.
     1.5. The CDDAR Team Chief will coordinate with Wing Plans and Readiness office,
     Bioenvironmental Engineering (BEE) offices and Wing Safety, and perform a crash recovery
     exercise annually In Accordance With (IAW) AFI 21-101, paragraph 14.10.5.7.1.1. and
     14.10.5.8.9. Transient Alert (TA)/Crash Recovery section may perform additional in-house
     training exercises as required for currency/proficiency purposes.
INCIRLIKABI21-103 26 MARCH 2013                                                            3


  1.6. Rapid Removal of Aircraft on a Runway or Taxiway. During normal flying periods,
  disabled aircraft will be removed as quickly and safely as possible after touchdown.
  Damaged aircraft will be removed as soon as possible depending on structure condition,
  equipment requirements, etc. Damaged aircraft will be removed from the runway in a
  minimum time period consistent with the following:
     1.6.1. Personnel safety.
     1.6.2. Prevention of unnecessary secondary damage.
     1.6.3. Preservation of evidence for mishap investigation (IAW OPLAN 91-211).
  1.7. AMC/Commercial contract aircraft will follow procedures IAW 728 AMS MOI 21-1.
  1.8. Since the 39 ABW has no United States Air Force (USAF) primary aircraft assigned,
  the 39 MXS/Transient Alert section (MXMTA) is limited to general crash recovery
  procedures. 39 MXS will maintain crash recovery response equipment and vehicles. If a
  crane or other specialized equipment is needed, local rental/lease will be contracted by 39
  Contracting Squadron and funding secured through 39 Comptroller Squadron.
     1.8.1. The 39 ABW Crash Recovery program is a combined effort of the 39
     MXS/MXMTA, 728 AMS, 414 ERS, 90 Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron and
     TurAF. Each organization provides manpower and expertise within its respective
     specialties that recover, and if necessary reclaim mishap aircraft.
  1.9. The 728 AMS is an integral component of the Crash Recovery Team augmenting
  CDDAR with manning and expertise for large framed or cargo aircraft recovery. The 414
  ERS is the prime component of the MQ-1B Predator CDDAR effort providing manning,
  tools, and specific expertise for composite aircraft recovery.
     1.9.1. For mishaps involving AMC or AMC-contracted aircraft, TA/Crash Recovery will
     coordinate with the IC, in conjunction with 728 AMS on-scene maintenance
     representatives, to determine assistance requirements. The 728 AMS senior maintenance
     representative will, in turn, coordinate assistance through 728 AMS Aircraft Mobility
     Control Center (AMCC) or Maintenance Operation Center (MOC). 728 AMS will
     respond to AMC aircraft (military or contracted) emergencies with required tow
     equipment and trained tow personnel for emergency removal of disabled AMC aircraft
     from the runway. 728 AMS senior maintenance representative will provide qualified
     technicians to expedite recovery operations. 728 AMS will contact Headquarters (HQ)
     AMC Tanker Airlift Control Center/XOCL for further assistance if recovery capabilities
     are exceeded. For AMC-contracted aircraft, 728 AMS will contact the carrier
     representative directly or through HQ AMC and request/obtain guidance/authority to
     move the disabled aircraft.
  1.10. For mishaps involving Turkish or other NATO aircraft, the Emergency Operations
  Center (EOC) director at Incirlik Air Base (AB) will contact the appropriate agencies
  required to respond to an aircraft mishap. 39 ABW Command Post is the primary point of
  contact at Incirlik (DSN: 676-9920/9921/9922) with 24-hour coverage. The 39 Operations
  Squadron Commander (OS/CC) will coordinate responses from Civil Engineering and other
  required base elements. If the IC at Incirlik AB determines recovery is beyond the scope of
  39 ABWâ€™s capabilities, due to lack of specific Mission Design Series (MDS) equipment or
 4                                                      INCIRLIKABI21-103 26 MARCH 2013


     airframe expertise, he or she will notify the 39 ABW Command Post for coordination with
     the NATO or Turkish unit that has specific MDS expertise. This unit must ensure adequate
     personnel and support equipment is made available for recovery operations.
2. Declaration of Emergencies
     2.1. The aircrew is primarily responsible for declaring ground or in-flight emergencies.
     Emergencies may also be declared by air traffic control personnel or officials responsible for
     the operation of the aircraft, e.g. Supervisor of Flying (SOF), 39 OS/CC, 728
     AMS/CC/CD/AMCC, and mission director. The agencies listed above will not normally
     declare emergencies without concurrence of the aircrew, unless circumstances require
     immediate action.
     2.2. Individuals, other than those mentioned in paragraph 2.1, who become aware of aircraft
     emergency situations will use any means available to relay the necessary information to any
     agency capable of initiating emergency procedures (Tower, SOF, Radar Approach Control,
     Fire Department, Command Post, Airfield Management (AM), MOC, etc.).
     2.3. Persons declaring emergencies (ground or in-flight) should provide the following
     information:
        2.3.1. Aircraft identification and type.
        2.3.2. Nature of emergency.
        2.3.3. Pilot's desires/intentions.
        2.3.4. Aircraft altitude, position and estimated time of arrival estimated time of arrival or
        location on airfield for ground emergencies.
        2.3.5. Number of people on board.
        2.3.6. Fuel on board.
        2.3.7. Number and type of ordnance on board. NOTE: Pass information available,
        including ordnance on board. Do not delay declaring the emergency.
     2.4. Ultimately, emergency information must be passed to the Control Tower to activate the
     Primary Crash Alarm System (PCAS). If unable to contact Tower, notify AM, who will
     activate the Secondary Crash Net. AM, in turn, notify the Tower by land-line.
