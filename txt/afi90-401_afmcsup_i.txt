SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This is the second publication of AFI 90-401. The initial publication superseded AFR 11-7, 22
December 1983, eliminating the requirement to file reports for congressional committee
investigations, hearings, or visits. This revision establishes the Office of Legislative Liaison,
Congressional Action Division, SAF/ LLX, as the OPR to provide support to wing
commanders during visits with members of Congress and their staffs. SAF/LLX will provide
support to wing commanders in coordination with the Office of Budget and Appropriations
Liaison, SAF/FML, as appropriate.

Paragraphs 3.2 and 4.1 are modified, and paragraph 4.9 is added. Additionally, paragraph
1.4 is consolidated into paragraph 1.2, and existing paragraphs 1.5through 1.8 are re-
designated as paragraphs 1.4 through 1.7.

(AFMC) AFI 90-401, 1 Jul 1998, is supplemented as follows: It provides clarifying guidance
on Installation Commander visits with Congressional delegations and provides a post-visit
contact report template for content standardization. It also defines Inspector General
responsibilities regarding congressional inquiries. Further, this supplement implements an office
symbol change to HQ AFMC/CCX-LL for the AFMC Office of Congressional Activities, due to
AFMC reorganization. Finally, contained within, is a detailed process flowchart for proper
staffing of congressional inquiries.
1. Releasing Information:
    1.1. Congressional Inquiries. Air Force policy is to cooperate fully with the Congress,
    and to give full and timely responses to congressional inquiries.
       1.1.1. (Added-AFMC) While this supplement primarily emphasizes SAF/LL’s
       Installation Commander Visit Program, AFMC/CC encourages Product, Test,
AFI90-401_AFMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                           3


     Sustainment, AFGLSC, AFNWC, and AFRL Commanders to visit Capitol Hill as
     necessary.
     1.1.2. (Added-AFMC) The AFMC Congressional engagement strategy is to take
     advantage of targets of opportunity whenever Congressional delegations are available in
     order to educate and inform.             Congressional delegation/staff delegation
     (CODEL/STAFDEL) visits to installations are both to be given the highest attention and
     priority of all AFMC Commanders.
     1.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Congressional inquiries shall be expedited, fully answer the
     question asked, plus educate and inform whenever possible.
  1.2. Classified Information. Air Force personnel must properly safeguard information
  classified in the interests of national defense (according to DoD 5200.1-R, Information
  Security Program Regulation, June 1986, with Change 1 and AFI 31-401, Information
  Security Program Management [formerly AFRs 205-1 and 205-43]). We may disclose
  classified information to the Congress only with the consent of the Secretary of the Air
  Force IAW the aforementioned regulations. The Secretary has designated the Office of
  Security Review (SAF/PAS) as the approval authority for release of classified information to
  the Congress. Refer congressional requests for classified information to SAF/PAS
  through SAF/LL or SAF/FML. Also, Air Force officials must not disclose classified
  information to the Congress for release to a congressional constituent. The only exception is
  declassified and releasable information the constituent could receive under AFI 37-131
  (converting to AF Supplement to DoD 5400.7-R).
  1.3. "For Official Use Only" Information. According to AFI 37-131, Air Force Freedom
  of Information Act Program (converting to AF Supplement to DoD 5400.7-R), Air Force
  officials may generally not disclose For Official Use Only (FOUO) information to the public
  that falls within exemptions 2 through 9 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
  However, the Air Force may release such information to chairpersons or ranking minority
  members of congressional committees or subcommittees if the information relates to matters
  within their jurisdiction. An Air Force official who decides the information should not be
  released to the congressional committee must staff the congressional request for
  information with a recommendation to the Secretary of the Air Force through SAF/LL.
  1.4. Privacy Act Information. Air Force officials must protect personal information about
  military and civilian employees according to the guidelines of the Privacy Act. Without an
  individual’s written consent to release information, Air Force officials may provide only
  general information according to the provisions of AFI 37-132, Air Force Privacy Act
  Program (converting to AFI 33-332) which sets forth the Privacy Act procedures. The Air
  Force may, however, disclose an individual’s records without the individual’s consent when
  requested by a chairperson or ranking minority member of a congressional committee or
  subcommittee if the information relates to matters within their jurisdiction. When making
  such a disclosure, the Air Force should tell the committee or subcommittee members about
  any sensitive information and the need to safeguard it.
  1.5. Information from Air Force People. Air Force personnel have the legal right to
  petition, furnish information to, or communicate with the Congress (Title 5, United States
  Code, Section 7102 and Title 10, United States Code, Section 1034).
4                                                 AFI90-401_AFMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


    1.6. Locally Sensitive Information. Information on changes in the status of Air Force units,
    installations, and industrial facilities may have an impact on states and congressional districts.
    Therefore, Air Force officials must not release such information without approval from
    the Secretary of the Air Force. Refer congressional requests for such information to the
    Office of the Secretary of the Air Force through SAF/LL or SAF/FML.
    1.7. Congressional Security Clearances. Senators and Representatives have Top Secret
    clearances. The Air Force allows members on special committees to see all documents
    relevant to the committee. To verify the security clearance of congressional staff members,
    contact the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Legislative Affairs Security Office
    (OSD/LA).
2. Congressional Visits:
    2.1. Members of Congress and their staffs may need to visit Air Force activities. The Air
    Force fully supports and encourages these visits.
    2.2. With Secretary of the Air Force approval, the Air Force may provide transportation for
    congressional visits.
    2.3. Restrictions on congressional visits apply during election years and to political
    activities. Contact SAF/LL or the Office of Public Affairs (SAF/PA) about these restrictions.
3. HQ USAF Responsibilities:
    3.1. Secretary of the Air Force. Only the Secretary may deny congressional requests for
    information or approve congressional travel to Air Force activities.
    3.2. Office of Legislative Liaison (SAF/LL). Secretary of the Air Force Order 112.1 gives
    SAF/LL the authority and responsibility (except for Appropriations Committees, Budget
    Committees and the Congressional Budget Office) for relations with the Congress, the
    Executive Office of the President and Vice President, the Office of Secretary of Defense, and
    other governmental agencies. Official liaison includes:

       Attachment 1 for phone and fax numbers), or after office hours through the Air Force
       Operations Center, HQ USAF.
4. Air Force MAJCOM and FOA Responsibilities:
    4.1. Commanders and staff agency chiefs should inform or coordinate with SAF/LL or
    SAF/FML on all matters of congressional interest including participation in local activities
    and visits with members of Congress or their staffs. The next sections give more specific
    instructions.
    4.2. Community Activities:
       4.2.1. Notify SAF/LL or SAF/FML when local plans or activities generate significant
       community interest and may interest Members of Congress.
       4.2.2. When you plan to invite Members, staff or employees of Congress, the Executive
       Office of the President, or the Office of the Vice President, send SAF/LL the signed
       invitation and a cover letter explaining the details of the event 60 days in advance. If 60
       days notice is not possible, call the Air Force House or Senate Liaison Office to
       determine the best way to extend the invitation to Members of Congress, and call the Air
       Force Congressional Inquiry Division for the best way to extend the invitation to the
       Executive Office of the President or the Office of the Vice President. These offices can
       also advise on the proper forms of address. Make no public announcement until SAF/LL
       or SAF/FML confirms that the guests will attend. Do not mention transportation of
       members, employees, or spouses in the invitation.
       4.2.3. Coordinate with SAF/LL or SAF/FML when Members of Congress or staff plan
       to visit your Air Force activity.
AFI90-401_AFMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                            7


     4.2.4. Do not commit the Air Force to providing transportation until SAF/LL notifies
     you that transportation is approved.
  4.3. Congressional Inquiries to Local Commanders:
     4.3.1. Air Force policy is to respond promptly and factually to direct requests for
     information from Members of Congress and their staffs. Commanders will establish
     appropriate procedures to:
     4.3.2. Comply with paragraphs 1.1 to 1.7 of this instruction.
         4.3.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Unless a congressional inquiry falls into the AFMC-
         defined “special handling” categories (i.e., Health Insurance Portability and
         Accountability Act (HIPAA) related/medical documents or IG personnel matters), it
         must go back through HQ AFMC/CCX-LL (via the appropriate AFMC two-letter).
         The “specially handled” inquiries cited above require no info copy to HQ AFMC on
         either the tasker or the response (see Chart 1--Congressional Inquiry Process
         Flowchart). For inquiries that require a response back to Air Staff within 48 hours or
         less, HQ AFMC/CS will determine if response(s) require AFMC/CC/CV/CA
         signature/approval. If not required, the Centers may respond back to SAF/HAF, but
         must info copy HQ AFMC/CCX-LL on the response.
            4.3.2.1.1. (Added-AFMC) Personnel-related congressional inquiries are the
            responsibility of the Installation Inspector General, as a timeliness and
            accountability issue. In the case where the congressional inquiry involves
            HIPAA-related information, protection of the patient’s private health information
            must be maintained. However, unprotected information should still be sent to the
            Installation IG to ensure proper tracking of a timely response. Absent special
            circumstances (i.e., potential impact to the AFMC mission, media interest,
            potential litigation), do not obtain coordination from MAJCOM headquarters and
            Center staff. (Attachment 2 contains a graphic depiction of proper staffing for
            personnel-related congressional inquiries).
     4.3.3. Inform SAF/LL or SAF/FML of all congressional inquiries. Fax a copy of a
     written inquiry to the Legislative Liaison Inquiry Division (SAF/LLI) within 24 hours of
     the time you receive it. For an inquiry received by telephone, transcribe and fax it to the
     Inquiry Division within 24 hours of receipt or by the first duty day following a
     weekend or holiday. (See Attachment 1 for fax numbers.).
     4.3.4. Commanders may sign congressional inquiries submitted directly to the unit. Give
     SAF/LL or SAF/FML a copy of all congressional communications, including original
     inquiries and proposed replies.
  4.4. Congressional Inquiries to Overseas Commanders:
     4.4.1. Because of their sensitive nature, process all inquiries about cases dealing with
     Status of Forces Agreements, individual privileges or rights while stationed outside the
     continental United States, legal or policy problems, or issues that may become sensitive
     or controversial as follows:
     4.4.2. Within 24 hours of receipt of a congressional inquiry, send an acknowledgment
     that SAF/ LL will send a final reply. Do not speculate on decisions or dates.
8                                                 AFI90-401_AFMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009


       4.4.3. Within 5 workdays, fax SAF/LL a double-spaced draft interim or final response
       together with copies of needed back-up information or correspondence.
       4.4.4. Inform SAF/LL of any changes in intensity or scope of the case.
    4.5. Congressional Field Hearings and Investigations:
       4.5.1. SAF/LL or SAF/FML is the commander’s liaison with the Secretary of the Air
       Force on all congressional requests for inspection, investigation, and summary reports
       that require the Secretary’s attention.
       4.5.2. Members of Congress and their personal and committee staff are entitled to
       courtesy and respect. Proper identification admits them to any base, field installation,
       or facility and allows them to use private working space and facilities at a central
       location. Commanders must ensure that all personnel fully cooperate with committees
       during hearings and investigations. Allow access to controlled areas in accordance with
       DoD 5200-1.R and AFI 31-401.
       4.5.3. When a committee wants to examine official documents, files, or records within
       its area of interest or pertinent to its investigation, provide the material in a room set aside
       for the committee unless release of these materials is not allowed under paragraph 1.1
       Assign an Air Force representative to assist if needed.
       4.5.4. Refer any requests from a congressional committee to copy, remove, or retain
       official files, documents, or records (or copies of these documents) to SAF/LL or
       SAF/FML. SAF/LL or SAF/ FML, as appropriate, will coordinate requests to remove
       files with the Air Force Records Officer (AFCIC/ITC).
       4.5.5. Coordinate with Office of the General Counsel (SAF/GC) concerning release of
       documents related to congressional investigations when there are legal issues involved
       such as the Privacy Act and claims of privilege.
       4.5.6. If a committee notes any deficiencies in Air Force operations or procedures during
       its field investigation and if the Air Force can take immediate corrective action, do so and
       advise the committee and either SAF/LL or SAF/FML.
    4.6. Congressional Itinerary Changes:
       4.6.1. A commander or escort officer who learns of a change in congressional itinerary
       must coordinate with facilities scheduled for later visits to avoid unannounced arrivals.
       4.6.2. The escort officer coordinates each schedule change with SAF/LL or SAF/FML
       and with all affected activities. All Air Force personnel must give the officer full
       cooperation.
       4.6.3. For unescorted trips, the host commander notifies SAF/LL or SAF/FML of
       itinerary changes and any new or changed requests. Coordinate directly with facilities
       scheduled later in the itinerary regarding briefings, transportation, quarters, or other
       support.
    4.7. Photography During Congressional Visits:
       4.7.1. When the Air Force takes photographs during a congressional visit, the host field
       organization must send copies of black and white, 5 by 7-inch glossy prints, with
AFI90-401_AFMCSUP_I 7 OCTOBER 2009                                                          9


     captions, to SAF/LL or SAF/FML within 72 hours after they are developed. For color
     photographs, send a first-generation transparency.
     4.7.1. (Added-AFMC) Prior to visit, supporting POC or servicing visual information
     support center should coordinate with SAF/LL or SAF/FML to document the visit with
     digital still cameras. Visual information personnel should make every effort to supply
     electronic imagery to supported POC prior to departure. If not possible, transmit imagery
     with caption information to appropriate POC within 72 hours, in .TIFF file format. If
     files are too large to electronically transmit, mail a disk with imagery and caption
     information within 72 hours to appropriate POC.
     4.7.2. Original negatives of congressional visits are non record photography. Destroy
     them with the permission of the local commander. The Air Force may arrange for
     processing prints of congressional visits through Air Force-sponsored, government-
     owned, or commercially operated plants.
  4.8. Congressional Committee Investigation or Visit:
     4.8.1. If SAF/LL or SAF/FML personnel do not escort members of the Congress or
     their staffs, field commanders should inform SAF/LL or SAF/FML about the outcome of
     the visit or investigation. Field commanders should also provide information to other
     interested echelons at their discretion.
         4.8.1.1. (Added-AFMC) For congressional visits and invitations, provide HQ
         AFMC/CCX-LL with the following information: visitor(s) name, date of visit,
         purpose of visit, and OPR (include DSN phone number). Ensure local protocol
         offices are made aware of visits by Congressional members and staff members by
         completing a Distinguished Visitor (DV) Notification via the web at
         ttps://www.protocol.wpafb.af.mi l. Note: The protocol website is the means by
         which AFM C/CC/CV/CA are made aware of congressional visits.
         4.8.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Provide HQ AFMC/CCX-LL with a post visit contact
         report within 7 calendar days of the visit to include any action items resulting from
         the visit. A post visit contact report template is contained in Attachment 3.
     4.8.2. Convey the following information to SAF/LL or SAF/FML: the site and length of
     the visit, names of visiting Members of Congress and staff representatives, deficiencies
     disclosed by the visit, requests for information, and corrective action.
  4.9. Wing Commander Visits With Congressional Delegations:
     4.9.1. USAF Wing Commanders are required to visit Capitol Hill annually to meet with
     their congressional and home state delegations. Commanders should contact SAF/LLX
     (DSN 225-1000) to arrange these meetings and provide escort.
         4.9.1.1. (Added-AFMC) AFMC Installation Commanders are required to visit
         Capitol Hill annually to meet with their Congressional delegations. Home state of
         record visits are optional. Installation Commanders are encouraged to bring their
         Command Chiefs and/or other representatives of the base. Visits are normally
         scheduled after the President’s Budget is delivered to Congress and after the SECAF
         and CSAF have accomplished their first Congressional Posture Hearing. HQ
         AFMC/CCX-LL is the focal point for scheduling these visits.

           4.9.1.2. (Added-AFMC) Installation Commanders will normally meet with both
           Senators from the state in which the base is located and Representative Member(s)
           from the district in which the base is located.
           4.9.1.3. (Added-AFMC) Visits are intended to be relationship building courtesy
           calls during which Congressional Members can meet with Commanders and discuss
           Air Force issues important to them and their constituents. Commanders will deliver a
           consistent Air Force message to Capitol Hill in addition to discussing information on
           their specific installation. Installation Commanders should also educate and inform
           delegations on matters pertaining to their parent Center whenever possible. Short
           handouts (visual aids) to leave with the Member’s office are recommended and shall
           be coordinated with HQ AFMC/CCX-LL prior to the visit. Installation Commanders
           will submit visit materials NLT 7 calendar days prior to the congressional visit date.
           4.9.1.4. (Added-AFMC) Installation Commanders will also submit post visit
           contact reports in an item of interest (IOI) format within 7 calendar days of their visit
           directly to AFMC/CC/CV/CA/CS with a courtesy copy to HQ AFMC/CCX-LL. If
           sensitive issues arise out of the visit, the organization visited will inform HQ
           AFMC/CCX-LL within 1 calendar day. The post visit contact report shall include
           names of Congressional and Air Force members in attendance, topics discussed and
           action items resulting from visit. A post visit contact report template is contained in
           Attachment 3.
        4.9.2. (Added-AFMC) AFMC/CC encourages Product, Test, Sustainment, AFGLSC,
        AFNWC, and AFRL Commanders to visit Capitol Hill as necessary. HQ Air Force
        legislative liaison functional area experts are the focal point for these visits. The AFMC
        Congressional engagement strategy is to take advantage of targets of opportunity
        whenever Congressional delegations are available in order to educate and inform.
        CODEL/STAFDEL visits to installations are both to be given the highest attention and
        priority of all AFMC Commanders.
5. (Added-AFMC) AFMC Headquarters Staff and Unit Responsibilities. AFMC is
responsible for complying with the provisions of AFI 90-401. To meet these responsibilities in a
prompt, factual and consistent manner, HQ AFMC established the Office of Congressional
Activities in HQ AFMC/CCX-LL as the Command office of primary responsibility (OPR) for
congressional activities. For questions, contact this office at DSN 787-8450, commercial (937)
257-8450, FAX DSN 787-6192, FAX commercial (937) 257-6192 or e-mail “HQ AFMC/CCX-

     5.1.4. (Added-AFMC) With the exclusion of the Legislative Initiatives Program,
     AFMCI 51-101, for which HQ AFMC/JA is the Command focal point, HQ AFMC/CCX-
     LL is the Command focal point for coordinating legislative issues through SAF/LL (and
     other SAF/HAF “LL” offices). See Attachment 2 for the Congressional Inquiry Process
     Flowchart.
        5.1.4.1. (Added-AFMC) In the event a congressional inquiry requires inputs from
        multiple functionals to develop an AFMC response, HQ AFMC/CCX-LL will
        coordinate with the respective functional to determine a lead OPR.
  5.2. (Added-AFMC) HQ AFMC Directorates/Offices and Field Unit Responsibilities.
     5.2.1. (Added-AFMC) Comply with AFI 90-401, AFI 90-301 and AFI 51-101, as
     applicable. Additionally, report congressional inquiries, congressional visits, and
     invitations whether written or verbal, that have not passed through HQ AFMC/CCX-LL,
     to HQ AFMC/CCX-LL workflow within 1 working day of notification. The guidance
     provided in Chart 1 delineates the normal process as well as AFMC-defined special
     handling exceptions.
     5.2.2. (Added-AFMC) Submit inquiry responses (if required, as specified in
     Attachment 2) through HQ AFMC/CCX-LL within 7 calendar days of receipt, to meet
     SAF/HAF’s 10-calendar day suspense. Note: If a response is required within 48 hours
     or less, and HQ AFMC/CS deems it appropriate, the Center may respond directly to
     SAF/HAF, but must info copy HQ AFMC/CCX-LL on the response.
