SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This revision incorporates interim change (IC) 2001-1 by adding requirement for the unit stan/eval func-
tion to ensure and document the annual review of MTRs (paragraph 3.2.2.10.). Additional provisions of
IC-2001-1 were determined to already be covered in existing text or to be out of scope for this instruction.
The following is a synopsis of changed requirements set forth in this revision:
Formalizes MAJCOM, NAF and unit responsibilities in the processing of AF Forms 847 for flight and
other AF publications (paragraphs 2.3.2.5.1. thru 2.3.2.5.2., 2.3.2.6.2., 2.4.2.3.1. thru 2.4.2.3.2., 3.2.2.9.,
3.3.2.5., Attachment 5); tasks the OGV to establish procedures to maintain and review unit FEFs (para-
graph 3.2.2.2.); changes approving official from MAJCOM/DO to OG/CC (with notification to MAJ-
COM DO) when designating additional OGV flight examiners (paragraph 3.2.3.3.); requires MAJCOM/
DO notification when ARFC/ANG OG/CC designates flight examiners not assigned to squadron/OG
(paragraph 3.2.3.4., 3.3.3.3.); deletes paragraph stating that senior flight examiners will normally admin-
ister evaluations to lower echelon flight examiners (old paragraph 3.5.5.); deletes the Instrument
Refresher Course as a requisite for INSTM evaluations (paragraph 5.2.1.2.); clarifies procedures for
instructor evaluations including the use of INIT INSTR designation (paragraphs 5.2.1.4. thru 5.2.1.4.3.);
simplifies the requisite completion window (paragraphs 5.2.7.1. and 5.2.7.2.); adds guidance on remedial
actions for evaluation deficiencies (5.2.12. thru 5.2.12.3.); adds guidance for aircrews flying in non-US
Air Force Aircraft and with non-US Air Force Units (paragraph 5.2.17.); makes EPE evaluation a require-
ment for MSN evaluations (paragraph 5.3.1.); requires flight surgeons to complete examination for each
aircraft in which they fly as a crewmember (paragraph 6.6.); specifies the date format for all fields in the
AF Forms 8 (paragraph 7.3.2.1.); requires the organization and location of the FTU be used on all AF
Forms 8 generated for students (paragraph 7.3.4.2.2.); specifies the flight examiner as the party responsi-
ble for the content of the AF Form 8 (paragraph 7.3.6.1.1.1.); directs the flight examiner to be the first
dated signature on the AF Form 8 (paragraph 7.3.6.1.1.3.); clarifies documentation responsibilities of any
flight examiners who participated in administering an evaluation but did not sign Section III of the AF
Form 8 (paragraph 7.3.6.1.3.); directs that the reviewing and final approving officers for AF Forms 8 gen-
erated during formal courses will be assigned to the FTU (paragraph 7.3.6.2.2.); directs the examinee to
be the last dated signature on the AF Form 8 (paragraph 7.3.6.4.); establishes guidance on the minimum
requirements of a temporary evaluation certificate (paragraph 7.3.7.2.); adds additional documentation
guidance for ground re-checks (paragraph 7.3.8.3.6.); clarifies documentation procedures for commander
directed downgrades (paragraphs 7.3.9.3. thru 7.3.9.3.2.4.); implements changes in format and content of
the AF Form 942 (paragraph 7.4.); directs that FEFs be maintained by a stan/eval function wherever they

reside (paragraphs 7.5.1.1. and 7.5.1.2.); limits responsibility of unit maintaining FEF to that documenta-
tion added after the initial review of the FEF (paragraph 7.5.4.1.1.); implements separation of FEF dis-
crepancies into major and minor categories with only documentation of major discrepancies becoming a
permanent part of the FEF (paragraph 7.5.5.); provides guidance for correcting entries on the AF Forms 8
and 942 (paragraph 7.5.5.4.)

                                              EVALUATIONS

5.1. General. The Aircrew Stan/Eval Program utilizes three types of evaluations to ensure qualification
of aircrew members and standardization of operations. Aircrew qualification evaluations are administered
periodically and documented on the AF Forms 8 to ensure aircrew qualification. Emergency Procedures
Evaluations (EPEs) are requisites for some aircrew qualification evaluations. Supplementary evaluations
are unstructured tools to be used by the commander to ensure standardization of flying and other opera-
tions.

5.2. Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. Aircrew qualification evaluations consist of two structured
phases, ground and flight. Each phase requires the completion of requisite tasks. The ground phase, if
required, includes a series of examinations and evaluation of aircrew performance in a controlled emer-
gency procedures environment. The flight phase includes an in-flight or, if applicable, simulator evalua-
tion of aircrew performance.
     5.2.1. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Types. There are five types of aircrew qualification evalu-
     ations that may be further described by four prefixes. Periodic aircrew qualification evaluations are
     administered to ensure basic qualification in the MDS and crew position of an aircrew member
     (QUAL), qualification to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (INSTM if applicable) and
     qualification to employ the MDS of the aircrew member in accomplishing the unit's operational mis-
     sion (MSN). Provisions are made to periodically ensure aircrew are certified and maintain instructor
     qualification (INSTR) and provide the flexibility to evaluate and certify specific aircrew performance
     (SPOT). Aircrew will complete the following types of aircrew certification evaluations as appropriate:
        5.2.1.1. QUAL Evaluations. All aircrew will complete a periodic QUAL evaluation in their pri-
        mary assigned aircraft, to include requisites, as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific,
        Volume 2.
        5.2.1.2. INSTM Evaluations. All Air Force pilots (and other pilots flying operationally with the
        Air Force, e.g. exchange pilots) will maintain instrument qualification (exception: indoctrination
        flyers who fly under the provisions of AFI 11-401, Flight Management, USAF Test Pilot School
        students, and TG-glider pilots). To maintain instrument qualification, pilots must successfully
        complete a periodic INSTM evaluation, including the requisite open book instrument examination
        required by AFMAN 11-210, Instrument Refresher Course Program.
            5.2.1.2.1. A commander may revoke the instrument qualification of any pilot under his/her
            command who fails to maintain minimum instrument flying skills. To revoke an instrument
            qualification for reasons not related to an evaluation, use the procedures for a com-
            mander-directed downgrade in paragraph 7.3.9.
            5.2.1.2.2. A pilot with a revoked or expired instrument qualification may not fly as a pilot
            except in a training program leading to requalification. Pilots in this situation must be in super-
            vised status.
        5.2.1.3. MSN Evaluations. All aircrew members maintaining MR/CMR or BMC aircrew status
        will complete a periodic MSN evaluation in their primary assigned aircraft, to include requisites,
        as specified in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volume 2. The MSN evaluation should
AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                                17


     reflect the type and difficulty of tasks required in the performance of normal operational and train-
     ing sorties. The requirement for a MSN evaluation may be waived for those aircraft whose perfor-
     mance of normal operational, test and training sorties involves tasks covered during the
     accomplishment of an INSTM and/or QUAL evaluation as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific
     Volumes 2. QUAL and MSN evaluations may be combined into a single evaluation as specified in
     AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific Volumes 2.
     5.2.1.4. INSTR Evaluations. All aircrew members maintaining instructor qualification in a partic-
     ular MDS aircraft must complete initial and periodic evaluations of instructional capability in that
     MDS aircraft.
         5.2.1.4.1. To initially qualify as an instructor in a particular MDS aircraft, the aircrew member
         must successfully complete an initial instructor (INIT INSTR) evaluation. Accomplish INIT
         INSTR evaluations on actual instructional missions whenever possible. When students are not
         available or mission requirements/crew composition requirements prevent inclusion of stu-
         dents, the flight examiner may serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the exam-
         inee's instructional ability.
         5.2.1.4.2. Periodic evaluation of the ability of aircrew members to instruct will be conducted
         during all subsequent periodic evaluations. The AF Form 8 Mission/Check description for
         these periodic evaluations will not include INSTR as the AF Form 8 aircraft/crew position is
         already annotated with highest qualification demonstrated during the evaluation (e.g. IP, IN,
         IF).
         5.2.1.4.3. If instructor qualification is lost in an MDS aircraft, it may be regained through an
         instructor requalification evaluation (see paragraphs 5.2.3.2.2. and 5.2.3.2.4.) as directed in
         AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1.
     5.2.1.5. SPOT Evaluations (Optional). A SPOT evaluation is an evaluation not intended to satisfy
     the requirements of a periodic (i.e., INSTM, QUAL or MSN) or INIT INSTR evaluation. SPOT
     evaluations have no specific requisites or requirements, unless specified in MAJCOM supple-
     ments. An evaluation begun as a SPOT evaluation may become (and be documented as) a required
     periodic evaluation if all required flight phase requirements are completed during the SPOT eval
     and the examinee subsequently completes all ground phase requirements for the evaluation within
     the periods described in paragraph 5.2.7. Do not add on missions (flights) to complete the require-
     ments for a periodic evaluation unless the group/squadron commander concurs with the aircrew
     member’s desire to realign the evaluation expiration date and approves the additional flight time
     requirements. All evaluations not listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1. - 5.2.1.5. above will be documented
     as SPOT evaluations. Note: When the flight examiner administering a SPOT evaluation is not
     qualified in the MDS and crew position of the examinee, the evaluation will not be credited
     towards a periodic evaluation.
  5.2.2. Combined Aircrew Qualification Evaluations. To promote efficient use of flying resources,
  accomplish evaluations concurrently, whenever practical. If combined, include the designation of
  each evaluation in the Flight Phase of the AF Form 8 - e.g., QUAL/MSN or INSTM/QUAL/MSN.
  5.2.3. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation Prefixes. The following prefixes will be used, if applica-
  ble, to further describe the evaluations listed in paragraphs 5.2.1.1. - 5.2.1.5. above:
     5.2.3.1. Initial (INIT). The first evaluation of any type for a crew position or instructor qualifica-
     tion in an MDS (e.g., INIT QUAL/INSTM, INIT MSN, INIT INSTR).
18                                               AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003


       5.2.3.2. Requalification (RQ). An evaluation administered to remedy a loss of qualification due to
       expiration of a required periodic evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency
       items as specified in applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1), a flight recheck following a
       failed periodic evaluation (see paragraph 7.3.8. for ground rechecks) or loss of qualification due to
       a commander-directed downgrade.
           5.2.3.2.1. When loss of qualification is for expiration of a required periodic evaluation, the
           evaluation given will be IAW the guidance for that periodic evaluation. The AF Form 8 Mis-
           sion/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix.
NOTE: When expiration of a required periodic evaluation is due to failure to complete one or more of the
ground phase requisites (see paragraph 5.2.4.), the flight evaluation has successfully been completed
within the eligibility period for an in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in para-
graph 5.2.7.2. for an out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation and the OG/CC determines that qualification
will be re-established by completion of the ground requisites without re-accomplishment of the flight
evaluation or completed ground requisites as outlined in paragraph 5.2.15., the AF Form 8 Mission/Check
description will not be documented with an RQ prefix.
           5.2.3.2.2. When loss of qualification is due to loss of currency, the evaluation profile will be
           as directed by the squadron commander and will include, as a minimum, those items for which
           the individual is non-current for over 6 months. The AF Form 8 Mission/Check description
           will be documented with RQ SPOT (exception: when loss of qualification is due to loss of cur-
           rency for instructor as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1, the AF Form 8 Mission/
           Check description will be documented with RQ INSTR).
           5.2.3.2.3. When loss of qualification is for failure to pass a flight evaluation, the recheck eval-
           uation will be IAW the provisions of paragraph 5.2.13. The AF Form 8 Mission/Check
           description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as applicable.
           5.2.3.2.4. When loss of qualification is due to a commander-directed downgrade (see para-
           graph 7.3.9.), the evaluation profile will be as directed by the commander. The AF Form 8
           Mission/Check description will be documented with an RQ prefix or RQ SPOT, as applicable.
           5.2.3.2.5. Do not use RQ to prefix a recheck following a failed INIT evaluation. No qualifica-
           tion was achieved, thus requalification is not possible.
           5.2.3.2.6. When requalification deals with instructor capability, the AF Form 8 Mission/
           Check description will be documented with RQ INSTR (not RQ SPOT).
       5.2.3.3. No-Notice (N/N). A no-notice evaluation is one where the examinee is notified of the
       evaluation at or after the beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The beginning of nor-
       mal preparation for a mission will be determined by the flight examiner and may be defined in the
       unit supplement to this instruction. The intent is to preclude extraordinary preparation for the mis-
       sion because it is to be an evaluation.
           5.2.3.3.1. The no-notice evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of daily air-
           crew performance and an assessment of unit training effectiveness.
           5.2.3.3.2. If an examinee elects, a no-notice evaluation may update an QUAL/INSTM/MSN
           evaluation expiration date provided all requirements for the evaluation are completed within
           the periods described in paragraph 5.2.7. If all requirements were not completed on the first
           flight, subsequent flights are authorized to complete required events. If the examinee elects not
AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                                 19


         to update a QUAL/INSTM/MSN evaluation expiration date, the evaluation will be docu-
         mented as a N/N SPOT evaluation.
     5.2.3.4. Simulator (SIM). An evaluation where the flight phase requisite is conducted in a simula-
     tor.
     5.2.3.5. More than one prefix may be used to describe an evaluation (e.g., N/N SIM SPOT). The
     applicability of any prefixes to portions of any combined evaluations will be explained under Mis-
     sion Description in the Examiner's Remarks (see paragraph 7.3.5.8..).
  5.2.4. Ground Phase Requisites. The ground phase for periodic aircrew certification evaluations
  includes a series of requisites as listed below. See Chapter 6 of this instruction for additional guid-
  ance on aircrew examinations.
     5.2.4.1. QUAL Evaluations. Open book examination, closed book examination, Boldface/Critical
     Action Procedures (CAPs) examination (if applicable), EPE and a publications check of all
     required flight publications.
         5.2.4.1.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for required flight publications as outlined in
         applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-specific series publications.
         5.2.4.1.2. Satisfactory performance requires individual flight publications be current and
         properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew members
         are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications required for the mission.
     5.2.4.2. INSTM Evaluations. Instrument examination. Note: Instrument refresher course (IRC) is
     not a requisite, but a ground training item, which must be completed according to AFMAN 11-210
     and AFI 11-202, Volume 1, Aircrew Training.
     5.2.4.3. MSN Evaluations. As specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2.
  5.2.5. Flight Phase Requisites. The flight phase for aircrew certification evaluations include execu-
  tion in the MDS or, if applicable, a suitable simulator of a profile that will allow evaluation of aircrew
  performance. The profile used to fulfill the flight phase requisite must incorporate all appropriate
  requirements set in the applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2, and allow accurate measure of
  the proficiency of the examinee. Evaluation profiles will reflect unit tasking, daily training missions,
  be realistic and incorporate current tactics.
  5.2.6. Timing of Aircrew Qualification Evaluations.
     5.2.6.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th month
     following the month in which the flight phase was successfully flown (e.g. a periodic evaluation in
     which the flight phase was completed on 9 Oct 01 expires on 31 Mar 03.).
     5.2.6.2. Scheduling. Schedule periodic evaluations in the eligibility period (6-month period prior
     to expiration date).
     5.2.6.3. Requirements Before Permanent Change of Station/Temporary Duty. If a periodic
     evaluation will expire within 3 months after the proposed departure for Permanent Change of Sta-
     tion (PCS) or during an upcoming Temporary Duty (TDY), complete the required evaluation(s)
     before departing for either the PCS or TDY.
         5.2.6.3.1. Obtain a MAJCOM stan/eval agency waiver for unusual situations.
20                                               AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003


            5.2.6.3.2. MAJCOM stan/eval agency waivers are not required for individuals who will PCS/
            Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) to a non-flying assignment or those departing PCS
            or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
        5.2.6.4. Squadron Commander-Extended Evaluations. Squadron commanders may extend the
        expiration date of periodic evaluations up to 3 months for the reasons listed below. Document such
        extensions with a Memo for Record placed in Section II of the FEF.
            5.2.6.4.1. Individuals assigned PCS/PCA to a non-flying assignment.
            5.2.6.4.2. Individuals departing PCS or TDY for retraining in another aircraft type.
            5.2.6.4.3. Individuals undergoing unit aircraft conversion.
            5.2.6.4.4. Individual removal from active flying status (e.g. separation or retirement from the
            Service).
            5.2.6.4.5. Individuals participating in real world operations (to include operations other than
            war, alert, etc.) who are not able to complete the required flight evaluation(s) before or during
            deployment.
     5.2.7. Requisite Completion. One set of requisites may be used to satisfy the requirements of com-
     bined evaluations as defined in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2. Requisites from a completed eval-
     uation may not be used for subsequent evaluations. For pilots possessing multiple instrument
     qualifications, the instrument exam may count for separate evaluations provided the instrument exam
     occurs for each evaluation IAW the provisions of paragraphs 5.2.7.1. and 5.2.7.2. For all evaluations,
     accomplish requisites as follows:
        5.2.7.1. In-the-Eligibility Period. For scheduled or no-notice periodic evaluations in the eligibil-
        ity period, all requisites must be completed within the 6-month eligibility period prior to the expi-
        ration date of the current evaluation period to update that expiration date.
        5.2.7.2. Out-of-the-Eligibility Period. For periodic evaluations outside the eligibility period, all
        requisites must be completed within a 6-month period encompassing the month in which the flight
        evaluation was administered.
        5.2.7.3. Recheck. For evaluations used to remedy a failed evaluation:
            5.2.7.3.1. Requisites that were valid for the failed evaluation per paragraph 5.2.7.1. or 5.2.7.2.
            above remain valid to update an evaluation expiration date upon successful recheck according
            to paragraph 5.2.13.1.
            5.2.7.3.2. Requisite completion dates from the Q-3 AF Form 8 will not be annotated on the
            recheck AF Form 8. The recheck AF Form 8 will only include documentation of the flight
            phase evaluation.
     5.2.8. Alternate Means of Evaluation. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not possible,
     the area may be evaluated verbally or in an Aircrew Training Device (ATD). Flight examiners will
     make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight before resorting to this provision. See the
     appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2 for areas prohibited from verbal/ATD evaluation.
     5.2.9. Evaluation Criteria Source. The MAJCOM designated as lead command in AFPD 10-9, in
     coordination with other user commands, will establish and maintain standardized QUAL, INSTM,
AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                               21


  MSN and INSTR evaluation criteria in the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2. The lead
  command is responsible for coordinating the establishment of:
     5.2.9.1. Areas/subareas to be used for documenting required evaluations including those required
     and critical for evaluation completion.
     5.2.9.2. Criteria for Publications Check.
         5.2.9.2.1. Each aircrew member is responsible for required flight publications as outlined in
         applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-specific series publications.
         5.2.9.2.2. Satisfactory performance requires individual flight publications be current and
         properly posted. In units that do not issue individual aircrew publications, aircrew members
         are still responsible for the accuracy and currency of all publications required for the mission.
     5.2.9.3. Cockpit/Crew Resource Management (CRM) evaluation criteria in the appropriate areas/
     subareas. Use AFI 11-290, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Training Program, and AF Form
     4031, Cockpit/Crew Resource Management Skills Criteria, as references
     5.2.9.4. Criteria to ensure operations comply with National Airspace System (NAS) rules and
     procedures. Specifically, ensure compliance with minimum safe maneuvering speeds below
     10,000 ft MSL and NAS awareness in all areas of mission planning and flight operations.
  5.2.10. Grading System. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document aircrew per-
  formance. Individual scores are recorded for examinations while areas/subareas of aircrew perfor-
  mance are individually graded against established evaluation criteria. Performance less than fully
  qualified is documented. An overall qualification level is determined from the compilation of these
  individual scores/grades.
     5.2.10.1. Written, Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Grade written, computer
     based or electronic examinations as a percentage of correct answers. See paragraph 6.4.4.1. for
     minimum passing grade specifics.
     5.2.10.2. Boldface/CAPs. Grade Boldface/CAPs examinations as either Qualified (Q) or
     Unqualified (U).
     5.2.10.3. Area/Subarea Grades. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2, will establish areas and sub-
     areas to be evaluated and the appropriate grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas will have
     a two-level (Q/U) or three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system. The overall area grade will be the low-
     est of any subarea grade awarded.
         5.2.10.3.1. Q. Q is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a satisfac-
         tory knowledge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within the prescribed
         tolerances and accomplished the assigned mission.
         5.2.10.3.2. Q-. Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area tasks, but
         requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner. Deviations
         from established standards must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances or jeopardize flight
         safety.
         5.2.10.3.3. U. Assign a U area grade for any breach of flight discipline, performance outside
         allowable parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely
         affected mission accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an
22                                              AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003


            area grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of the flight
            examiner, additional training will not constructively improve examinee’s performance, it is not
            required. In this case, the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief the examinee.
        5.2.10.4. Qualification Levels . EPE and overall evaluation performance are graded by qualifica-
        tion levels as follows:
            5.2.10.4.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The aircrew member demonstrated desired perfor-
            mance and knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in
            the grading criteria. This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted and may be
            awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
               5.2.10.4.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no U grades being given in any area(s)/sub-
               area(s).
               5.2.10.4.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude
               awarding of an overall Qualification Level 1.
               5.2.10.4.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the debrief
               of that evaluation.
            5.2.10.4.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to per-
            form duties safely, but:
               5.2.10.4.2.1. There were one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training was
               assigned.
               5.2.10.4.2.2. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U was awarded.
               5.2.10.4.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on perfor-
               mance in one or several areas/subareas.
            5.2.10.4.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable
            level of safety, performance or knowledge.
               5.2.10.4.3.1. An area grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall Q-3 for the
               evaluation.
               5.2.10.4.3.2. An overall Q-3 can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight examiner,
               there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/subareas.
     5.2.11. Grading Policies.
        5.2.11.1. Requisite Examinations. The flight examiner will consider performance on requisite
        examinations in assigning the overall qualification level.
        5.2.11.2. Performance Areas/Subareas. Use the grading criteria in the applicable 11-2
        MDS-Specific, Volume 2, to grade areas/subareas accomplished during an evaluation.
            5.2.11.2.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas/subareas listed as “required” in the gen-
            eral and specific evaluation sections of the applicable 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2.
            5.2.11.2.2. The flight examiner may grade any area/subarea accomplished during an evalua-
            tion if performance in that area/subarea impacts the specific evaluation accomplished or flight
            safety.
AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                             23


         5.2.11.2.3. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions.
         5.2.11.2.4. Minor momentary deviations from grading criteria tolerances are acceptable, pro-
         vided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize
         flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade.
     5.2.11.3. Overall Qualification Levels .
         5.2.11.3.1. The overall qualification level awarded an evaluation is based on performance dur-
         ing both the flight and ground phases. This grade should be awarded only after all evaluation
         requirements have been completed and given due consideration.
         5.2.11.3.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must satisfy the
         criteria set forth in the applicable MDS-Specific, Volume 2 and demonstrate ability to operate
         the aircraft and/or equipment safely and effectively during all phases of an evaluation.
         5.2.11.3.3. Overall qualification grades will be a cumulative process. While AFI 11-2 MDS
         Specific, Volume 2, guidance may dictate the highest grade for a flight or EPE based on area
         and subarea performance, flight examiner judgment will always be the determining factor in
         deciding the overall qualification level.
  5.2.12. Remedial Action. All grades of Q- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy and/or
  deficiency in performance while maintaining flight and operational safety. Remedial action includes
  debriefing discrepancies, assignment of additional training and imposing of flight restrictions.
     5.2.12.1. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the evalua-
     tion wherein the flight examiner provides briefing/instruction concerning the discrepancy and
     determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to remedy the
     discrepancy. The discrepancy area/subarea description is annotated with “Debriefed” in paragraph
     B of the Examiner’s Remarks section of the AF Form 8 Comments.
     5.2.12.2. Additional Training. Any training recommended by a flight examiner to remedy defi-
     ciencies identified during an evaluation.
         5.2.12.2.1. Additional training may include self-study, ground instruction, use of a simulator
         or flying. To complete additional training, the examinee must demonstrate attainment of satis-
         factory knowledge or proficiency.
         5.2.12.2.2. Additional training is documented in paragraph C, Recommended Additional
         Training, under Examiner's Remarks in the AF Form 8 Comments. Description of assigned
         additional training will include how satisfactory knowledge or proficiency will be demon-
         strated to a flight examiner, supervisor or instructor.
         5.2.12.2.3. Due dates and dates on which additional training is completed will be documented
         in the appropriate areas of the AF Form 8 (see paragraphs 7.3.5.6. and 7.3.5.7.).
         5.2.12.2.4. Commanders will ensure required additional training is completed. Accomplish
         additional training by the last day of the second month following the date of the discrepancy,
         e.g. for an evaluation on 21 Jan 02, additional training due 31 Mar 02. AFRC/ANG accom-
         plish additional training by the last day of the third month following the date of the discrep-
         ancy. If an aircrew member exceeds the allotted time for completion of additional training, the
         squadron commander will review the situation and direct appropriate action. Document the
24                                               AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003


            circumstances with a Memo for Record placed in Section II of the FEF of the affected individ-
            ual.
        5.2.12.3. Restrictions.
            5.2.12.3.1. When called for by this instruction or deemed necessary in the judgment of the
            flight examiner, flight restrictions will be imposed on the examinee until successful comple-
            tion of assigned additional training and/or a recheck.
            5.2.12.3.2. Restrictions should address the specific phase of flight and/or operation that
            requires supervision until successful retraining is completed. Restrictions are not punitive, but
            designed to enhance flight and operational safety.
            5.2.12.3.3. Specific restrictions will be documented as the first item of the AF Form 8 Com-
            ments.
     5.2.13. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation .
        5.2.13.1. Recheck. If an aircrew member fails a flight evaluation, a successful recheck must be
        completed by the end of the second month after the date of the first failure, e.g. for an evaluation
        on 20 Jun 02, complete recheck by 31 Aug 02. AFRC/ANG accomplish recheck by the last day of
        the third month following the date of the first failure. A recheck is successfully completed when
        the aircrew member performs to Q criteria (Q or Q-/debriefed) for each area graded U. OG/CCs
        may approve waivers to the time limits in this paragraph on a case-by-case basis. Document such
        action with a Memo for Record placed in Section II of the FEF. Every reasonable effort must be
        made to requalify the individual. Commanders will determine the number of flights to be allowed
        during this period, based on the individual's experience level, present qualifications and number of
        hours of training required.
        5.2.13.2. Status Downgrade. Downgrade aircrew members receiving a Q-3 INSTM, QUAL or
        MSN evaluation to non-mission ready (NMR)/non-combat mission ready (N-CMR), non-basic
        mission capable (N-BMC), or non-basic aircraft qualified (N-BAQ) status, as applicable. For
        instructor evaluations, aircrew status (i.e., MR/CMR or BMC) need not be downgraded if the dis-
        crepancies were only in instructor areas.
        5.2.13.3. Restrictions. Restrict aircrew failing to complete an evaluation within the required
        period (see paragraph 5.2.15.) or receiving a Q-3 on an evaluation, as listed below, until a success-
        ful evaluation is completed:
            5.2.13.3.1. QUAL or INSTM Evaluation. Place the examinee on supervised status.
            5.2.13.3.2. MSN Evaluation. The examinee may perform basic qualification/ instrument tasks
            unless specifically restricted. Place the examinee on supervised status for mission tasks.
            5.2.13.3.3. INSTR Evaluation. Instructors receiving an unsatisfactory grade in any instructor
            area(s) will not perform instructor duties until a successful recheck is completed.
     5.2.14. Supervised Status. If unsatisfactory performance requires the aircrew member be placed on
     supervised status, the type of supervisor (i.e., instructor or designated supervisor) will be determined
     by the squadron commander (or equivalent) and as specified in AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 1.
     Supervision will be accomplished by instructors or designated supervisors (as specified in AFI 11-2
     MDS-Specific, Volume 1) qualified in the specific aircrew position.
AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                                 25


  5.2.15. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If an aircrew member
  fails to complete an evaluation (either ground phase or flight phase) within the eligibility period for an
  in-the-eligibility period evaluation or within the period listed in paragraph 5.2.7.2. for an
  out-of-the-eligibility period evaluation, the aircrew member loses the qualification covered by the
  evaluation and the restrictions of paragraph 5.2.13.3. apply. Qualification may be re-established by
  administering a requalification evaluation (see paragraph 5.2.3.2.) or by completion of the delinquent
  evaluation. OG/CCs may approve waivers to preclude the re-accomplishment of completed requisites
  to complete the evaluation on a case-by-case basis. Document such action with a Memo for Record
  placed in Section II of the FEF.
  5.2.16. Multiple Qualification. For aircrew members (other than those in a Companion Trainer Pro-
  gram) who maintain qualification in two or more mission design aircraft (e.g., F-16 and F-15) accord-
  ing to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, the following guidance applies (for purposes of this instruction,
  different series [models] of the same basic aircraft do not constitute multiple qualification - e.g. F-16C
  and F-16CG):
     5.2.16.1. Documentation. Document MAJCOM authority for multiple qualification, including a
     list of aircraft in which qualification will be maintained, in a Memo for Record placed in Section
     II of the FEF. (For Air Force Materiel Command [AFMC], MAJCOM authority may be delegated,
     but not lower than wing commander.)
     5.2.16.2. Instrument Evaluation. Pilots need only complete an INSTM evaluation, to include
     requisites, in one of the aircraft in which they maintain qualification as specified by the authoriz-
     ing MAJCOM unless additional INSTM evaluation requirements are directed by the MAJCOM in
     its supplement to this instruction.
     5.2.16.3. Qualification and Mission Evaluations. All aircrew require a QUAL evaluation, and,
     if applicable, a MSN evaluation, to include requisites, in each mission design aircraft according to
     applicable AFI 11-2, MDS-Specific, Volumes 2.
     5.2.16.4. Failure to Pass a Flight Evaluation. A Q-3 on an INSTM evaluation results in a
     downgrade in all aircraft flown. A downgrade resulting from a Q-3 in QUAL or MSN evaluation
     applies only to the aircraft for which the evaluation was administered.
  5.2.17. Aircrews Flying in Non-US Air Force Aircraft and with Non-US Air Force Units. A i r -
  crew members performing duties in non-US Air Force aircraft per AFI 11-401, or on duty with or
  attached to non-US Air Force units for flying, abide by host service or host country rules, except for
  the requirement to maintain a current physical and review their flight records according to AFI
  11-202, Volume 1. They do not necessarily abide by USAF rules, including AFI 11-202, Volume 2,
  and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2. Therefore, when they return to USAF units, they must com-
  plete applicable requisites and be evaluated for any periodic USAF evaluations that expired during
  their tour. The restrictions in paragraphs 5.2.13.3.1. through 5.2.13.3.3. of this instruction apply to
  such individuals until successful evaluations are completed. (Exception: MAJCOM/DOV may
  approve exceptions to this paragraph, if, after case-by-case review, they determine non-USAF evalua-
  tions are equivalent to applicable AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2 evaluations. Document such
  action with a Memo for Record placed in Section II of the FEF on top of the non-USAF AF Form 8
  equivalent.) Note: Air Force units that use non-US Air Force aircraft to execute an Air Force flying
  program may use Air Force guidance, as permitted in the applicable Memorandum of Agreement/
  Understanding.

5.3. Emergency Procedures Evaluations .
     5.3.1. Scope. Evaluate an aircrew member’s knowledge of MDS EPs and systems knowledge for all
     QUAL evaluations; evaluate MSN specific emergency procedures and systems knowledge during
     MSN evaluations. Only one EPE need be accomplished for each combined evaluation (i.e., one EPE
     for an INSTM/QUAL or INSTM/QUAL/MSN evaluation).
     5.3.2. Satisfactory Performance. Satisfactory performance for EPEs requires taking the proper
     action in the correct sequence, not a verbatim response. Each aircrew member is responsible for the
     Boldface/CAPs applicable to their crew position.
     5.3.3. Content and Administration. AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2, will specify contents of
     EPEs and whether EPEs may be done in-flight, in an ATD, or verbally.
     5.3.4. Grading. The flight examiner will assign an EPE grade (1, 2 or 3) in the Qualification Ground
     Phase block of the AF Form 8, regardless of whether all or a portion of the EPE was performed
     in-flight.
     5.3.5. Additional Training. For an EPE requiring additional training, the flight examiner will indi-
     cate if the additional training will be accomplished before the flight evaluation under restrictions in
     the Comments block of the AF Form 8.
     5.3.6. Boldface/CAPs Failure. An incorrect response to a Boldface/CAP situation during an EPE
     requires an unqualified (Q-3) EPE grade. An aircrew member who receives a Q-3 grade as a result of
     Boldface/CAPs error will not fly until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.
     5.3.7. Unqualified EPE. An examinee receiving an unqualified EPE grade (Q-3) will be placed on
     supervised status until a successful reevaluation is accomplished.

5.4. Supplementary Evaluations. Supplementary evaluations are administrative tools to be used by the
commander to identify and evaluate implemented solutions to operational problems. These evaluations
are most often administered as inspections (using specifically prepared checklists) whose results are
reported to the commander. The form and content of supplementary evaluations is entirely at the discre-
tion of the commander.
     5.4.1. Supplementary evaluations are not aircrew qualification evaluations.
     5.4.2. Commanders will determine evaluated areas. The stan/eval function will determine the method
     of evaluation, is responsible for administrative management of data collection and will report results
     as directed by the commander.
     5.4.3. Individuals other than flight examiners, as determined by the OG/CC, may conduct supplemen-
     tary evaluations.
     5.4.4. Supplementary evaluations may be administered in conjunction with a flight evaluation. If con-
     ducted in-flight, supplementary evaluations should not be all encompassing, result in the assignment
     of an overall rating for any specific aircrew member or be documented on an AF Form 8.
     5.4.5. Supplementary evaluation results will be documented in SEB minutes.

                              AIRCREW EXAMINATION PROGRAM

6.1. Purpose. The Aircrew Examination Program measures aircrew member knowledge of normal/emer-
gency procedures, threats and other information essential for the safe and effective operation of their
assigned weapon system through the administration of written, computer based or electronic examina-
tions. Poor testing performance on examinations indicates areas requiring increased training emphasis.

6.2. Scope. The Aircrew Examination Program includes requisite examinations for periodic evaluations,
unit periodic examinations and Flight Surgeon examinations. Requisite examinations include qualifica-
tion open book and closed book examinations, instrument examinations and Boldface/CAPs examina-
tions as described in paragraph 5.2.4.. The ability to focus on specific knowledge areas is enhanced by the
management of examination content and use of appropriate master question files.

6.3. Administrative Procedures.
   6.3.1. Program Documentation. Units will describe the unit aircrew examination program in the
   unit supplement to this instruction.
   6.3.2. Computer Based or Electronic Examinations. Computer based or electronic information
   management tools may fulfill the requirement for examinations as outlined in this instruction.
   6.3.3. Retention of Examination Records. The stan/eval function will retain graded exam answer
   sheets/computer records until AF Form 8 is completed.
   6.3.4. Examination Question Review. The stan/eval function will review all MQFs and prepared
   exams for accuracy annually and after any changes in source documents. Units will document their
   procedures for reviewing and updating MQFs and prepared exams in their unit supplement to this
   instruction.
   6.3.5. End-of-Course Examinations. FTUs administering USAF Formal School courses listed in
   the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcement (ETCA) database
   (https://etca.keesler.af.mil/) may use end-of-course (EOC) examinations to fulfill the requirements
   of the open book, closed book and Boldface/CAPS (if applicable) requisite examinations.
       6.3.5.1. The stan/eval agencies of the MAJCOM responsible for training will coordinate with the
       MDS lead command to ensure the EOC examination meets the requirements of this instruction
       and AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2, before awarding credit for requisite completion.
       6.3.5.2. EOC examination test questions do not need to incorporate MAJCOM MQFs. All ques-
       tions must reflect the latest changes to all systems and/or operational procedures and not conflict
       with any MQFs.
       6.3.5.3. All EOC examinations that fulfill the requirements of requisite examinations will be
       graded according to paragraph 6.4.4.1. and entered on the AF Form 8 according to paragraph
       7.3.5.1.

6.4. Requisite Examinations. Aircrew members will complete open book, closed book and Boldface/
CAPs examinations (if applicable) as requisites for periodic QUAL evaluations (see paragraph 5.2.4.1.;
instrument examinations as requisite for periodic INSTM evaluations (see paragraph 5.2.4.2.and any
28                                               AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003


other examinations required by the appropriate AFI 11-2 MDS-Specific, Volume 2 (see paragraph
5.2.4.3.).
     6.4.1. Instrument Examinations. Pilots will take the instrument exam as specified in paragraph
     5.2.1.2. of this instruction.
     6.4.2. Requisite Examination Management. With the exception of written Boldface/CAPs exami-
     nations, maintain either requisite examinations for each crew position or generate a unique test for
     each aircrew member requiring an exam. If requisite examinations are maintained for each crew posi-
     tion:
        6.4.2.1. Develop and control a minimum of two requisite examinations for each crew position.
            6.4.2.1.1. Units having ten or fewer individuals per crew position require only one examina-
            tion.
            6.4.2.1.2. When different crew positions are responsible for the same information (for exam-
            ple, in two-place fighters, front and back seat or left and right seat pilots of the same aircraft),
            units are not required to maintain separate examinations for each crew position.
        6.4.2.2. Change fifty percent of the questions on the requisite examinations every calendar year.
     6.4.3. Examination Security. Stan/eval personnel will maintain positive control of all requisite
     exams, applicable answer sheets and associated computer based/electronic media. Instrument requi-
     site exams and answer sheets associated with administration of the IRC may be controlled by the unit
     training function.
     6.4.4. Grading Policy For Examinations.
        6.4.4.1. Minimum Passing Grade. The minimum passing grade for Boldface/CAPs exams is
        100 percent. The minimum passing grade for all other stan/eval requisite examinations is 85 per-
        cent - corrected to 100 percent.
        6.4.4.2. Requisite and Boldface/CAPs Examination Grading Restriction. Units will grade all
        completed requisite and/or Boldface/CAPs exams prior to the aircrew member’s next flight. Units
        will describe how this restriction is enforced in the unit supplement to this instruction.
     6.4.5. Examination Question Sources.
        6.4.5.1. Open Book Requisite Exam. Open book questions will come from publications con-
        taining information pertinent to the operation of applicable aircraft and performance of the
        assigned mission. The open book subject areas and the publications used to generate the exam will
        be made available to aircrew. Each unit may develop an open book secure question bank (SQB)
        that serves as the source for some or all of the open book examination questions. Do not distribute
        the SQB to unit aircrews and safeguard it in the same manner as any other required stan/eval
        examination.
        6.4.5.2. Closed Book Requisite Exams. Closed book questions will come from MQFs. These
        questions will emphasize system knowledge and information necessary for safe flight and mission
        accomplishment.
            6.4.5.2.1. MDS-Specific MQFs. Lead command MAJCOMs will ensure MDS-specific MQFs
            containing approved questions for closed book testing are available for MAJCOM use and dis-
            tribution to applicable aircrew.
AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                              29


            6.4.5.2.1.1. The highest organization with a stan/eval function (NAF or unit) may develop,
            maintain and publish MQFs for weapons systems without MAJCOM expertise. That orga-
            nization will submit these MQFs to the MAJCOM for approval prior to their publication.
            6.4.5.2.1.2. MAJCOM OPRs will review MQFs annually and distribute changes to MQFs
            as necessary.
                6.4.5.2.1.2.1. Units may edit MQFs to accommodate local testing procedures, admin-
                istrative errors and reflect recent changes to systems and/or operational procedures;
                however, subject matter may not be changed.
                6.4.5.2.1.2.2. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the appropriate MAJCOM.
         6.4.5.2.2. Local Procedures MQF. Units may develop and distribute a local procedures MQF
         to augment HHQ MQFs.
     6.4.5.3. Instrument Requisite Exams. Instrument test questions come from the Instrument
     MQF maintained by the Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA). The selection and content
     of the questions is dictated by the provisions of AFMAN 11-210.
  6.4.6. Boldface/CAPs Requisite Examinations.
     6.4.6.1. Aircrew member knowledge of applicable Boldface/CAPs will be evaluated through a
     written examination as a requisite to all periodic QUAL evaluations.
     6.4.6.2. Satisfactory performance for the Boldface/CAPs examination requires writing the proper
     actions in the correct sequence, not necessarily a verbatim response. The flight examiner will
     assign a Boldface/CAPs grade (Q or U) in the Qualification Ground Phase block of the AF Form
     8.
  6.4.7. Failure to Pass a Requisite Exam. An evaluation will not be complete until all failed items
  have been successfully re-accomplished.
     6.4.7.1. Reexamination Policy. An aircrew member failing a requisite examination or Boldface/
     CAPs at any time must be afforded an adequate study period prior to reexamination. For other than
     Boldface/CAPs, the aircrew member will be reevaluated using an alternate exam.
     6.4.7.2. Reexamination Period. Aircrew members who fail a requisite examination must com-
     plete a successful reexamination by the end of the second month (AFRC/ANG: third month) fol-
     lowing the date of the first failure. Waiver authority to extend the time allowed to successfully
     complete the examination is the OG/CC. Document such waivers with a Memo for Record placed
     in Section II of the FEF of the affected individual.
     6.4.7.3. Boldface/CAPs Reexamination Restriction. Aircrew members failing a Boldface/
     CAPs exam will not fly as aircrew members until a successful reexamination is accomplished.
     6.4.7.4. Supervised Status Requirement. Place aircrew members who fail a requisite open
     book, closed book, or instrument examination in supervised status until successful retesting is
     completed. For aircrew members who maintain multiple qualifications, supervised status resulting
     from failure of either an open or closed book examination applies only to the aircraft for which the
     examination was administered. Failure of a requisite instrument exam results in the examinee
     being placed in supervised status in all aircraft flown.

6.5. Unit Periodic Examinations (optional). Each group/squadron stan/eval function may conduct peri-
odic testing for all aircrew. The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional knowledge beyond the scope
of requisite exams, such as a cross-section of general knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or oper-
ational procedures, etc., to determine if knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit. This exam may be
open or closed book, but will not count as a requisite exam, nor will a requisite exam satisfy the require-
ment for a periodic exam. Units will describe this program in the unit supplement to this instruction, to
include procedures for failed exams.

6.6. Flight Surgeon Examinations. Flight surgeons will complete an aircrew examination every 17
months for each aircraft in which they fly on as an aircrew member. The unit-developed Flight Surgeon
Exam will cover, as a minimum, the emergency procedures applicable to the flight surgeon’s crew posi-
tion. Flight surgeons will not fly on any USAF aircraft as an aircrew member until successful completion
of the exam. Units flying flight surgeons as aircrew members will document the results IAW procedures
detailed in the unit supplement to this instruction.

                                 EVALUATION DOCUMENTATION

7.1. Scope. Administration of the aircrew qualification evaluation program requires accurate documenta-
tion. The qualifications and authorizations to which an aircrew member is to be evaluated are determined
from the unit certification document. The results of an evaluation are recorded on the AF Form 8, which
then serves to certify the qualification of the aircrew member. The chronological history of evaluations for
an aircrew member is recorded on an AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation. Both these AF Forms are
maintained in the FEF for the aircrew member.

7.2. Qualifications/Authorizations. A certified ARMS product or a unit certification document signed
by the official authorized to approve AF Forms 8 or other appropriate authority, designated in writing,
may be used to indicate special qualifications/authorizations as required.

7.3. AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
   7.3.1. Purpose. Use the AF Form 8 to record and to certify aircrew member qualification as demon-
   strated in required ground and flight evaluations.
       7.3.1.1. Use a separate AF Form 8 for all flight phase rechecks.
       7.3.1.2. Ground rechecks will be completed on the original Q-3 AF Form 8 (see paragraph 7.3.8.).
   7.3.2. General Data Entry. Use the following guidance when completing an AF Form 8 and see
   Attachment 3 for sample AF Forms 8.
       7.3.2.1. For date fields in the AF Form 8, use a two-digit day, three-letter month and two-digit
       year format (e.g., 25 Dec 01). (Exception: For electronic forms, use the date format required by
       the form.)
       7.3.2.2. The Eligibility Period and Expiration Date of Qualification will use a three-letter month
       and two-digit year format (e.g., Apr 01) (except when a different format is required for electronic
       forms).
       7.3.2.3. Except for the organization of the Comments block described in paragraph 7.3.5.8., sam-
       ple AF Forms 8 are provided to demonstrate the content, not the format, of the data presented (see
       Figure A3.1. through Figure A3.5.).
       7.3.2.4. To facilitate the entry of data on the form, except where specifically noted otherwise, use
       upper and lower case letters.
       7.3.2.5. Requirements for letter font, numbers of spaces for indentation and justification (right,
       left or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format stan-
       dards for such data entry.
   7.3.3. Date Completed.
       7.3.3.1. Use the latest completion date (ground or flight phase) of the evaluation requisites, not
       including additional training.
       7.3.3.2. Use this date on the AF Form 942.

        one qualification level number if all parts of the evaluation were awarded the same qualifica-
        tion level grade.
        7.3.5.3.3. If the qualification levels assigned parts of a combined evaluation vary, indicate the
        qualification level for each part separately (e.g., “INSTM: 1” and “QUAL: 2” in the qualified
        block or “INSTM/MSN: 1” in the qualified block and “QUAL: 3” in the unqualified block).

        is 17 months after the month in which the flight phase of the evaluation was successfully com-
        pleted.
        7.3.5.4.2. For evaluations that do not establish a new eligibility period, enter “N/A.”
        7.3.5.4.3. Combined evaluations (e.g., INSTM/QUAL) require only one date if all parts of the
        evaluation were successfully completed and “N/A” if all parts were assigned an unqualified
        grade.
        7.3.5.4.4. For a combined evaluation where one component is successfully completed and one
        component is assigned an unqualified grade, indicate by assigning a new expiration date for
        those portions completed successfully, and “N/A” for those portions awarded an unqualified
        grade (e.g., QUAL 1 and INSTM 3, then enter “QUAL-Jul 02 / INSTM-N/A”).

        filed in the FEF.
        7.3.7.4. MAJCOMs may establish a suspense for the insertion of the completed permanent AF
        Forms 8 in the FEF.
     7.3.8. Ground Rechecks.
        7.3.8.1. Ground rechecks are accomplished subsequent to the debriefing of an unqualified evalu-
        ation when the flight examiner deems a flight recheck unnecessary.
        7.3.8.2. The ground recheck will be documented on the original AF Form 8 generated to docu-
        ment the Q-3 flight evaluation (see Figure A3.5.).

         item in the Comments block based on the original failed evaluation.
         7.3.8.3.6. Examiner's Remarks: Recommended Additional Training. Document all recom-
         mended additional training associated with grading areas whose deficiencies will be remedied
         by a ground recheck under subparagraph labeled Ground.
         7.3.8.3.7. The flight examiner that administered the flight evaluation will sign the front of the
         AF Form 8. If the recheck examiner is different than the initial flight examiner, the recheck
         examiner will sign and date an appropriate statement in the Comments/Examiner’s Remarks.
  7.3.9. Commander-Directed Downgrade. Any commander (squadron/detachment or above) in the
  aircrew member’s chain of command may direct a downgrade to an intermediate level of qualification
  or unqualified status without administering an evaluation under the following guidance:
     7.3.9.1. For flying-related cases, use for cause only, e.g., breach of flying discipline or flight
     safety - including incidents not observed by an examiner, or observed, but by an examiner of
     another aircrew specialty.
     7.3.9.2. For non-flying-related cases, do not use as a substitution for, or in lieu of, administrative
     or judicial actions. Use in cases where such actions directly affect the commander’s confidence in

        left or centered) of data are not specified. MAJCOM supplements may direct specific format stan-
        dards for such data entry.
        7.4.1.3. A one-line entry is used for all evaluations with the exception of those on which the qual-
        ification levels awarded portions of a combined evaluation are not all the same.
        7.4.1.4. For combined evaluations in which different qualification levels are awarded to any of the
        portions, a single line entry will be made for each different qualification level awarded indicating
        which portions of the combined evaluation received that qualification level.
        7.4.1.5. Use each AF Form 942 until it is filled or “Z” out any unused blocks.
     7.4.2. Type Aircraft. Enter type MDS used during the evaluation as it appears in the Acft/Crew Posi-
     tion area under Examinee Identification of the subject AF Form 8.
     7.4.3. Type of Evaluation. Enter type of evaluation (or applicable portions of a combined evaluation
     in which different qualification levels were awarded to different portions - see paragraph 7.4.1.4.) as
     it appears in the Mission/Check area under Flight Phase of the subject AF Form 8. If the evaluation
     did not include a flight phase, enter type of evaluation as it appears in the Examination/Check area
     under Ground Phase of the subject AF Form 8.
     7.4.4. Date Completed. Enter date from the Date Completed area of the subject AF Form 8 (i.e., the

     7.4.7. Computer Generated AF Forms 942. Computer generated AF Forms 942 may be used as
     long as cumulative entries are retained. Electronic copies of the AF Form 942 should be forwarded
     with the FEF when the individual moves to a new squadron. If electronic backups are normally main-
     tained on removable storage media (e.g., floppy disk) or are specifically prepared to facilitate transfer
     of an FEF, file the storage media behind the AF Form 972 in Section I of the FEF.
AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                                 39


7.5. Flight Evaluation Folders. The FEF contains the source documents that constitute the history of
flying qualification for each aircrew member. The AF Form 8 is the source document used to record and
certify the qualification of an aircrew member. A complete history of the AF Forms 8 in an FEF is main-
tained on an accompanying AF Forms 942.
   7.5.1. Maintenance. Each aircrew member who is on flying status (except flight surgeons) must have
   a FEF, which includes all AF Forms 8, AF Forms 942, and additional MAJCOM specified items.
       7.5.1.1. The FEF must be maintained by a stan/eval functional office - normally in the organiza-
       tion to which the individual is assigned or attached for flying.
       7.5.1.2. HHQ personnel on active flying status may have their FEFs maintained by the stan/eval
       function at their assigned stations.
       7.5.1.3. The FEF for personnel in inactive flying status will be maintained with their Flight
       Records Folder (FRF).
       7.5.1.4. FEF maintenance may be further defined in the MAJCOM supplement to this instruction.
       7.5.1.5. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of the ser-
       vice of the unit of attachment to document their history of qualification.
   7.5.2. Contents of FEF. Divide the FEF into two sections:
       7.5.2.1. Section I (left side). This Section contains AF Forms 942, MAJCOM required items and
       those items authorized by the unit supplement to this instruction (e.g., logs of initial and annual
       reviews).
           7.5.2.1.1. AF Forms 942 should be on top of this section, in chronological order with the most
           recent on top.
           7.5.2.1.2. If used, file backup electronic storage media behind the AF Form 942 in Section I
           of the FEF.
           7.5.2.1.3. If the FEF is not maintained at the same base with the individual's flight record, a
           copy of the most recent AF Form 1042, Medical Recommendation for Flying or Special
           Operational Duty, and AF Form 702, Individual Physiological Training Record, may be
           filed in this section. If used, place AF Form 1381, USAF Certification of Air Crew Training,
           or any certifications, qualifications, and/or authorizations in this section.
       7.5.2.2. Section II (right side). This Section contains AF Forms 8 and Memos for Record for all
       evaluations listed on the AF Forms 942 in Section I.
           7.5.2.2.1. File AF Forms 8 in chronological order with the most recent on top.
           7.5.2.2.2. Permanent Memos for Record documenting waivers, extensions and major discrep-
           ancies relating to qualification (see paragraph 7.5.5.1.1.) are filed in chronological order with
           AF Forms 8.
           7.5.2.2.3. Memos for Record documenting major discrepancies of a particular AF Form 8 will
           be filed on top of that Form 8 regardless of date the discrepancy is discovered.
           7.5.2.2.4. Memos for Record documenting similar discrepancies found on multiple AF Forms
           8 will be filed on top of the latest affected AF Form 8.

            7.5.2.2.5. Copies of these source documents may be filed with other unit agencies for evalua-
            tion program management.
     7.5.3. Description of Folders.
        7.5.3.1. Folders must be letter size, able to separate contents into two sections and constructed of
        heavy stock (recommend press board folder or equivalent).
        7.5.3.2. Standard 2 3/4-inch metal fasteners may be used.
        7.5.3.3. Affix a label bearing the individual's name and SSAN to the inside back cover so that the
        folder may be identified when filed. Include additional information on the label if required.
     7.5.4. Review of FEF.
        7.5.4.1. Initial Review. The flying unit will review the FEF for all newly assigned aircrew mem-
        bers to establish their qualification prior to their first flight.
            7.5.4.1.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for establishing the currency and qualifi-
            cation of the aircrew member as determined from the latest applicable documentation in Sec-
            tion II of the FEF. Following determination of the currency and qualification of the aircrew
            member, the unit maintaining the FEF is responsible only for documentation subsequently
            placed in the FEF.
            7.5.4.1.2. If the FEF of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the stan/eval
            function at their assigned stations, that stan/eval function will also review the FEF prior to
            their first flight.
        7.5.4.2. Annual Review. As a minimum, the stan/eval function will review each FEF annually
        for expiration dates of required evaluations as outlined in the unit supplement to this instruction.
        The unit supplement will include how the annual review of FEFs is to be documented. An annual
        review of FEFs for personnel in inactive status is not required.
     7.5.5. FEF Discrepancies. FEF Discrepancies include those of the AF Forms 8 and 942 contained
     therein.
        7.5.5.1. Categories of Discrepancies. Discrepancies are categorized by their impact on qualifi-
        cation.
            7.5.5.1.1. Discrepancies that alter the qualification of the affected aircrew member are consid-
            ered major.
            7.5.5.1.2. Those discrepancies that do not alter the qualification of the affected aircrew mem-
            ber are considered minor and include typos, formatting and misspellings.
        7.5.5.2. Major Discrepancies Disposition. Major discrepancies are documented on a permanent
        Memo for Record filed in Section II immediately above the affected AF Form 8, or in chronolog-
        ical order with the AF Forms 8 for items other than those found on AF Forms 8.
        7.5.5.3. Minor Discrepancies Disposition. Minor discrepancies are documented on a non-per-
        manent record as defined by the unit supplement to this instruction.
            7.5.5.3.1. The record of minor discrepancies is to be used to ensure standardization of AF
            Forms 8, AF Forms 942 and aircrew member FEFs.
            7.5.5.3.2. Record of minor discrepancies need not reside in the FEF.
AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                                 41


         7.5.5.3.3. Any records of minor discrepancies kept in the FEF will be removed prior to any
         permanent change in station or status of the affected aircrew member.
     7.5.5.4. Corrections.
         7.5.5.4.1. AF Forms 8. As source documents, AF Forms 8 may be corrected by use of
         white-out/over-print or pen and ink alteration of the original document provided the flight
         examiner signing Section III of the Form 8 initials said correction.
         7.5.5.4.2. AF Forms 942. AF Forms 942, not being source documents, may be altered with-
         out restriction to reflect the assignment of the affected aircrew member and the contents of
         Section II of the FEF.
  7.5.6. Transfer of FEF. When custody of the FEF is transferred to a new unit or base:
     7.5.6.1. Retention of Records. Retain all records in the folder until reviewed by the gaining unit.
     After review, return those forms not retained in the folder to the individual.
     7.5.6.2. Formal Training Graduates. For Formal Training School graduates reporting directly
     to an overseas command for a short tour, retain formal training school records for transfer to the
     subsequent gaining unit.
     7.5.6.3. PCS of Individual. Aircrew members will normally hand-carry their FEF with their FRF
     to the gaining organization.
         7.5.6.3.1. When circumstances prevent this, the losing organization will mail the folder to the
         gaining unit.
         7.5.6.3.2. Mail any flight evaluation records not included in the folder at time of transfer to the
         gaining organization with clear identification of the individual concerned.
         7.5.6.3.3. When mailing an FEF or any of its contents, retain a copy until the gaining organi-
         zation has received the original FEF.
         7.5.6.3.4. If any FEF information is maintained electronically, a suitable storage media con-
         taining that information will be included with the FEF.
  7.5.7. Disposition of FEF.
     7.5.7.1. Dispose of the aircrew FEF according to AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule,
     and this instruction.
     7.5.7.2. Outdated certification letters, AFORMS products, Medical Recommendations and mis-
     cellaneous documentation identified during reviews will be returned to the aircrew member for
     disposal.

                                         UNIT SUPPLEMENT

9.1. The purpose of the unit supplement is to document the processes by which units implement the
requirements of this instruction. MAJCOMs will define the scope and content of unit supplements in their
MAJCOM supplement. Post the unit supplement behind the basic instruction and MAJCOM supplement.
9.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Purpose. The purpose of this supplement is to identify 305th/514th Opera-
tions Group (OG) Stan/Eval policies, procedures, and implements unit responsibilities established in AFI
11-202V2 and AFI 11-202V2/AMCSUP1. Specific responsibilities are defined herein for OG/OGV flight
examiners and OG subordinate unit flight examiners. Stan/Eval personnel will be thoroughly familiar
with and responsible for the contents of this chapter.
9.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Applicability. This chapter implements the 305th/514th Operations Group
Standardization/Evaluation (Stan/Eval) programs and is applicable to all units assigned to or attached for
flying duties within the 305th/514th Air Mobility Wings. MDS specific evaluation criteria are incorpo-
rated into respective AFI 11-2MDS-Specific V2 local procedures chapters. Specific 514th guidance, if
different, will be in italics.
     9.3.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Waiver Authority: OG/CC is the waiver authority for the requirements
     originating in this publication. Requests for waivers will be coordinated through Stan/Eval channels.
     9.3.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Recommendations for Changes: Recommendations for improvement or
     correction should be submitted to 305 OG/OGV or 514 OG/OGV (as applicable) via electronic AF
     Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, from the squadron Stan/Eval sections
     (DOV). See paragraph 9.10.2. (Added) of this instruction for the AF Form 847 process program.
     9.3.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Group-Specific Attachments: Operations Group-specific information can
     be found in Attachment 7 (Added) (305 OG) and Attachment 8 (Added) (514 OG). These attach-
     ments serve as capstone documents for the implementation and layout of local programs and pro-
     cesses that support the standardization and evaluation functions.
9.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) Stan/Eval Organization/Manning.
     9.4.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Flight Examiner Upgrade Program. The Operations Group Commander
     and Squadron commanders identify and certify experienced instructors for flight examiner status.
     Prior to certification as a flight examiner, candidates will accomplish the following:
        9.4.1.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Complete an in-house examiner orientation covering applicable pro-
        cesses for the respective organization. Stan/Eval Administration program guides should detail the
        orientation for that echelon.
        9.4.1.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) All non-prior flight examiners should observe at least one qualifica-
        tion/instrument and/or mission flight evaluation (as applicable). Non-prior KC-10 examiners will
        also observe a simulator evaluation being administered. The simulator evaluation should cover the
        basics of device control.
        9.4.1.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Be certified as a flight examiner in their designated crew position
        once the above requisites are completed. Squadron Commanders will certify squadron flight
        examiners. Operations Group commander will certify OG-level flight examiners.
AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                                    45


   9.4.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Detailed Local Internal Organization. The 305 OG/OGV is established
   under the OG/CC.
      9.4.2.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Group Stan/Eval. The 305 OG/OGV is responsible to the 305 OG/
      CC, 305 AMW/CC, 21 AF, and HQ AMC for standardization and evaluation expertise. The OG/
      OGV consists of the OG/OGV division and the stan/eval functions of the OG subordinate units.
      The 514 OG/OGV is responsible to the 514 OG/CC, 514 AMW/CC, 22 AF, and AFRC.
      9.4.2.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) OG/OGV flight examiners will ensure wing standardization by con-
      ducting squadron staff assistance visits (SAVs) and augmenting squadron flight evaluations.
      9.4.2.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) The Chief, OG/OGV will be the rater on officer and enlisted perfor-
      mance reports for all OGV assigned flight examiners.
   9.4.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Manning: OGV manning baseline is one evaluator per crew position per
   weapon system/function applicable to the group. Selected evaluators should hold all of the possible
   qualifications for their respective functions. If that is not possible, refer to guidance in applicable par-
   ent instructions/regulations for special considerations in topics such as pyramid evaluations. Due to
   squadron manning and tasking constraints within crew positions, one additional evaluator per crew
   position may be attached (on-loan) to OGV at the discretion of the OG/CC. Squadron DOV manning
   is at the discretion of the squadron commander.
9.5. (Added-MCGUIRE) Control of Evaluations.
   9.5.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Additional training follow-up. Squadron Review and Certification (R&C)
   Boards are tasked with following the progress of aircrew members placed in training status due to fail-
   ure to meet established standards.
      9.5.1.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) If individual has failed to requalify within 1 month (or first Unit
      Training Assembly [UTA] for 514 AMW, which ever is greater) after the disqualifying event, the
      R&C Board should determine the adequacy of training and successful progress while completing
      requalification requirements.
      9.5.1.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) If individual has failed to requalify by the last day of the second
      month (last day of third month for 514 AMW units IAW AFI 11-202V2), a second R&C Board
      should convene to determine the appropriate action such as retraining/requalification, Flying
      Evaluation Board, airman reclassification, etc. Any additional training beyond the training due
      date must be approved by the wing or group commander. The squadron commander will counsel
      the individual before an FEB or reclassification action is initiated.
   9.5.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) N/N Evaluation Program and Goals. All examiners may administer
   no-notice evaluations. Use the following guidance for no-notice evaluations:
      9.5.2.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) OGV will participate in the process as scheduling permits for qual-
      ity control. OGV no-notice evaluations will count toward squadron minimum numbers, depending
      on examinee’s squadron affiliation. If the OG/CC specifies a minimum quota for OGV N/N eval-
      uations, document the requirement in the program/process guide and report the numbers at the
      quarterly SEB.
      9.5.2.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Each squadron Stan/Eval will conduct sufficient no-notice evalua-
      tions to meet the 305 OG minimum of 20% of available, qualified aircrew members. (The 514 OG
      minimum will be determined by the 514 OG/CC but will be no less than the AMC-directed mini-
46                                               AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003


        mum of 15%). Scheduling of evaluations should be coordinated with OG/CC, SQ/CC, DO or DOV
        as applicable.
            9.5.2.2.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Squadron flight examiners may only conduct no-notice evalu-
            ations on personnel within their assigned squadron unless specifically requested by squadron
            CC/DO. OG flight examiners may conduct no-notice evaluations on MDS/crew position coun-
            terparts from any squadron within their OG provided the no-notice evaluation is outside the
            individual’s eligibility period.
        9.5.2.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) If the minimum activity is not observed IAW AFI 11-202V2, (main-
        tenance, weather, etc.) the evaluator will terminate the no-notice and depart without debriefing,
        critiquing, or discussing the terminated sortie with the evaluatee(s). An AF Form 8, Certificate of
        Aircrew Qualification, will not be generated, nor will the terminated no-notice count toward the
        individual’s maximum of one no-notice per calendar year. The flight examiner may give the exam-
        inee informal feedback.
        9.5.2.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) Ops Group program procedures/program guidance are incorporated
        in this publication.
     9.5.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Pyramid Evaluation Process. OG/OGV will maintain a list of senior eval-
     uators and their eligibility periods, at both group and squadron level, for evaluation purposes. Those
     positions subject to pyramid rules are outlined in parent instructions/regulations.
        9.5.3.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Squadron DOV will contact their OG/OGV counterparts for a pyra-
        mid evaluation at the beginning of the in-phase period and again, if not complete, within 30 days
        prior to the expiration date. OG/OGV will contact their NAF/DOV counterparts for a pyramid
        evaluation at the beginning of the in-phase period and again, if not complete, within 30 days prior
        to the expiration date.
        9.5.3.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) OG/CC may designate a secondary examiner at the group level to
        conduct pyramid evaluations if primary evaluators are not available.
        9.5.3.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) The 21 AF is waiver authority for wing-level pyramid evaluations if
        secondary evaluators cannot be found. Squadron pyramid evaluation waivers for squadron evalu-
        ators will originate and be approved by OGV. Each pyramid evaluator is responsible for granting
        a waiver for the pyramid evaluation he is tasked with.
9.6. (Added-MCGUIRE) Trends.
     9.6.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Evaluations. Squadron DOVs will compile trend data from SEMSPRO
     and submit to OGV on a time schedule commensurate with the SEB notifications.
        9.6.1.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Significant trends will be briefed to the OG/CC. A ‘trend’ is defined
        as a statistically significant discrepancy rate of 25% (33% for 514 OG) in any area, or a change in
        the discrepancy rate that, in the opinion of OG Stan/Eval, indicates an adverse trend. Any area of
        concern, no matter how identified, will be addressed by the Stan/Eval Board. In addition, the
        squadron Chief of DOV will provide OG/OGV with any additional trend items identified by any
        means. As a goal, each evaluator should strive for a minimum of four comments on the appropri-
        ate AF Form 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet, per evaluation (good and bad) to ensure an
        adequate database for quarterly trend analysis. OG/OGV will analyze the deficiencies and deter-
        mine if any trend(s) exist. If any trend is identified, corrective action will be identified and imple-
        mented.

      9.6.1.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Trends. SEMSPRO will serve as the primary means of collecting
      trend information from evaluations. Squadrons will ensure trend entries for all administered eval-
      uations is compiled and forwarded to 305 OG/OGV by the end of each quarter (514 OG: semian-
      nually).
   9.6.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Test Questions. Trend information on test questions will be reported quar-
   terly (514 OG: semiannually) and evaluated by each crew position in OG/OGV for any problem areas.
   Significant trends will be reported in the SEB. Refer to the appropriate Trend Program/process for
   additional guidance.
   9.6.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Ground Training Evaluations. Ground training evaluation data will be
   compiled for the past year to identify any trends. Trend information resulting from ground training
   evaluations will be reported at the SEB and assigned a POC to correct any negative trends.

      ward a copy of each MDS SQB, per crew position, to 21 AF/DOV annually, or as they are
      changed. Each Test Manager creates, maintains, and secures their respective SQB, answer key,
      and question references both electronically and in paper format. Test Managers will review their
      SQB annually and after any pertinent publications change. A portion of each open book examina-
      tion will include questions pertaining to each mission qualification for which the aircrew member
      maintains qualification, including tanker/receiver air refueling, instructor, etc.
      9.8.1.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) 514 OGV. SQBs are also developed by each AE test manager at 514
      OG/OGV and are used to construct open book examinations. Each test manager creates, main-
      tains, and secures their respective SQB, answer key, and question references both electronically
      and in paper format. AE test managers will review their SQB annually and after any pertinent pub-
      lications change. A portion of each open book examination will include questions pertaining to
      each mission for which the aircrew member maintains qualification, certification, and instructor
      material. A minimum of 5 questions regarding each qualified and certified aircraft will be incorpo-
      rated into periodic open book examinations for AECMs that hold multiple aircraft qualifications
      and/or certifications IAW AFI 11-2AE V2, Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrew Evaluation Criteria.
      See Process 12 located at the 514 OG/OGV office for further guidance.

        9.8.2.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Master Question File (MQF). Master Question Files are produced
        by 21 AF/DOV and are used to construct closed book examinations. The 305 OG/OGV prints and
        distributes initial copies of MQFs to all 305th assigned squadrons, and a single copy of each MQF
        to the 514 OG/OGV, who will then reproduce them and distribute to 514th assigned squadrons.
        9.8.2.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) MQF Review/Revision Procedures. Squadron DOV personnel will
        forward recommended corrections to MQFs to their respective 305th OG/OGV Test Manager dur-
        ing data preparation prior to each Stan/Eval Board (SEB). The 305 OG/OGV Test Managers will
        evaluate this data to determine whether a recommendation will be made to 21AF/DOV to modify
        or delete the question from the MQF. If made, such a recommendation would be forwarded to
        21AF/DOV via the SEB minutes.
     9.8.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Periodic Testing Program. Supplemental testing may be conducted in
     addition to requisite exams. The exams may be either open or closed book. Provide OG/OGV with a
     copy of the supplemental exam. Squadron commanders and OG/OGV will be provided with examina-
     tion results. The minimum passing grade is 85 percent.
        9.8.3.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Ramifications/administrative action for failed supplemental exams
        will be at the discretion of the commander of the echelon originating the exam.
        9.8.3.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Flight Surgeon Procedures. The 305 OG/OGV will develop and dis-
        tribute periodic Flight Surgeon examinations to lower echelons and the 514 OG. Tests will be
        administered IAW weapon system-specific requirements at the squadron level. Refer to the testing
        program/process guide for additional group-specific guidance.
     9.8.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) Exams will be reviewed annually for accuracy and after any changes in
     the source documents. All paper versions of tests will be changed out annually IAW the AFI or when
     a revision is required because of publication changes. OGV will recall the old exams and release new
     exams when changes are required. In the event a question/answer is determined to be inaccurate, OGV
     may strike that question from the exam without invalidating the entire exam. The number of questions
     that may be deleted from a given examination without invalidating the entire exam will be at the dis-
     cretion of the Chief, OG/OGV (provided the number of accurate questions remains above the pre-
     scribed minimum). Specific procedures and timing for reviews will be spelled out in the testing
     program/process guide.
     9.8.5. (Added-MCGUIRE) Squadron DOV will normally administer requisite testing. Test results
     will be maintained IAW group-specific Testing Program guidance. Forward outdated or inaccurate
     questions to 305 OG/OGV. Squadrons will provide a testing room that allows adequate privacy for
     individual testing. Individual will be proctored at all times. Tests will be graded prior to next flight.
     Individuals who fail a written examination or Boldface/Critical Action Procedures (CAP) will be
     placed in supervisory status until successful accomplishment. The retake will not be administered on
     the same day as the failure without OG/OGV concurrence. Individuals are required to take an alter-
     nate version of the failed exam (N/A Boldface/CAP) within one week of failure. Each squadron will
     establish a policy to complete requisites IAW AFI 11-202 V2 paragraph 3.3.2.2. and 6.4.4.2.
     9.8.6. (Added-MCGUIRE) OG/OGV will develop, maintain, and distribute all requisite exams.
     Squadrons may assist in the development of the exams when requested by OG/OGV. All tests will be
     safeguarded and treated as controlled items. Each unit will be provided one (1) copy of each applica-
     ble exam. Additional copies may be requested from OGV.

   9.8.7. (Added-MCGUIRE) Individuals are required to complete closed book examinations without
   interruption. If the individual has to depart prior to completion of the exam, all unanswered questions
   will be graded incorrect. Boldface/CAP will be evaluated through a written examination as a requisite
   to all periodic Qualification Closed Book exams. Boldface/CAPs will either be grade Q or U in the
   Qualification Ground Phase block on the Form 8. The minimum passing grade for a Boldface/CAPs
   exam is Q1 (100%). Aircrew members failing a Boldface/CAPs exam will not fly as crewmembers
   until a successful reexamination is accomplished. Failure of prerequisites is annotated with both
   scores (i.e. 80/85, U/Q) and assigned a minimum overall grade of 3/1 in accordance with 21 AF/DOV
   and AMC/DOV verbal guidance.
9.9. (Added-MCGUIRE) Supplementary Evaluation Program.
   9.9.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) All OG/OGV personnel who attend any ground-training event should
   complete a survey form IAW the special evaluation program. The program may also identify addi-
   tional evaluators from lower echelons. The training evaluations (critiques) results and suggested
   improvements will be summarized during the SEB.

     manual, regulation/instructions will prepare and submit an AF Form 847 through their respective
     stan/eval function.
     9.10.2.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) AF Form 847s are submitted electronically. Paper copies are no
     longer accepted. OGV will assign and control all AF Form 847 submissions via “Unit Numbers.”
     The following Unit Number format should be used; OG + Year + Sequence Number (305 OG
     00-01). Do not include the office symbol, (i.e. 305 OG/OGV). If the originator of an AF Form 847
     is at the squadron level and the squadron has a DOV office, coordination should be through the
     squadron DOV. However, the first level of endorsement on the back of the AF form 847 will
     always be the OGV Chief (IAW AFI 11-215, Attachment 3). Subsequent endorsement levels are
     for NAF, MAJCOM, and Flight Manuals Manager (FMM).
     9.10.2.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Responsibilities. The chief OG/OGV is/will:
        9.10.2.3.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Be the final approving authority for all AF Form 847s sub-

        POCs by the OG/OGV chief. All return AF Form 847 e-mail traffic will be sent to these indi-
        viduals. Since electronically submitted AF Form 847s are electronically signed, this process is
        necessary to ensure AF Form 847s are properly coordinated at the unit level and forwarded to
        21 AF by appropriate personnel.
        9.10.2.3.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) OG/OGV will develop and submit a list of editorial sugges-
        tions and typographical errors to flight manuals that do not affect operational readiness. For-
        ward the list to 21 AF semi-annually for consideration at FMRCs.
        9.10.2.3.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) All AF Form 847s submitted will be processed in accordance
        with this chapter, AFI 11-215AMCSUP 1. A copy of all submitted AF Form 847s will be

AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                              53


   9.11.8. (Added-MCGUIRE) Squadrons are responsible for maintaining their mission kits as outlined
   in section 7 of this process.
   9.11.9. (Added-MCGUIRE) Squadrons will provide on-loan CMO manning as per section 2 of this
   program.
9.12. (Added-MCGUIRE) Squadron/Detachment/Flight Program.
   9.12.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Flight Evaluation Folders. The 305/514 OG/OGV flight evaluation
   folder (FEF) programs are divided into several distinct processes. They contain the procedures for
   maintaining the Flight Evaluation Folder, AF Form 942, Record of Evaluation, AF Form 1381,
   USAF Certification of Aircrew Training, AF Form 4025, Aircrew Summary/Close-Out Report,
   and AF Form 8. This program also includes information on the Standardization and Evaluation Man-
   agement System Program (SEMSPro) and Standardization and Evaluation (Stan/Eval) Network Drive
   access. Refer to the appropriate program/process guide.
      9.12.1.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Annual Review. An annual review will be conducted on each FEF
      IAW AFI 11-202V2, paragraph 7.5.4.2. Units may annotate FEF reviews on the AF Form 942, or
      they can be documented on an AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment
      Report, and turned into SARM for updating. If the AF Form 942 is used, make a one-line entry
      with the words “Annual Review” and the date. If any discrepancies are noted when conducting
      annual reviews, a permanent Memo For Record will be generated and filed in chronological order
      in Section II. (The following guidance applies only to 305 OG, and is N/A for 514 OG). Annual
      Reviews will not exceed 12 months from the date of the last review.
      9.12.1.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Due to the AF Host Aviation Resource Management Office
      (HARM) organization structure, the following forms will not be maintained in the FEF. Excep-
      tion: If the individual is attached for flying but the FEF is maintained elsewhere, these documents
      are required: AF Form 1042, Medical Qualification and AF Form 702, Physiological Training.
      9.12.1.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) AF Form 942. Refer to appropriate FEF program/process guide.
      9.12.1.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) AF Form 1381 Entries. This is a permanent record of certifications
      and special qualifications not documented on an AF Form 8. Use the AF Form 1381, USAF Cer-
      tificate Of Aircrew Training, as the primary source document to provide a current and historical
      record of each individual's certifications. Do not duplicate AF Form 8 qualifications on the AF
      Form 1381, except for aircraft commander, instructor and other certifications mandated by AMC.
      The 305 OG/OGV lists of certifications are maintained in the 305 OG/OGV Certification Program
      Guide (514 OGV maintains certifications under the umbrella of the FEF process). For additional
      AF Form 1381 information refer to the 305 OG/OGV FEF program guide under Attachment 7
      (Added).
          9.12.1.4.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) If an event has been downgraded from a check ride to a cer-
          tification (i.e. flight examiners), crewmembers who received an AF Form 8 check ride under
          the old 60-1 guidance do not require an annotation for this event on the AF Form 1381. The
          AF Form 8 in section II of the FEF is adequate documentation. If the AF Form 8 was purged
          because of old 60-1 guidance, the AF Form 942 are adequate documentation.
          9.12.1.4.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) If the approving/certifying official is not specified in govern-
          ing directives, one will be determined following the pyramid evaluation guidance contained in
          AFI 11-202 V2/AMCSUP1 (i.e. Sq/CC will certify squadron crewmembers, OG/CC will cer-
54                                              AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003


            tify Sq/CC, etc.). 305 OG/OGV maintains a list of these certifications and approving/certify-
            ing officials in the 305 OG/OGV Certification Program Guide.
            9.12.1.4.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Enter AF Form 1381 certifications in chronological order;
            list from earliest to latest. When additional clarification is necessary, supporting documenta-
            tion in the form of memos for record may be used. Place any memos for record directly behind
            the AF Form 1381 with the most recent on top.
        9.12.1.5. (Added-MCGUIRE) AF Form 4025, Summary Close Out Report. The AF Form 4025
        will be maintained in the training folder until after completion of training and then moved to the
        FEF behind Tab 2. See appropriate FEF program/process guide.
        9.12.1.6. (Added-MCGUIRE) AF Form 8. Reference this supplement, paragraph 9.12.5. (Added)
        for further guidance on the AF Form 8.
     9.12.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Flight Crew Information File. The FCIF program ensures safe and effi-
     cient flight operations through systematic posting of pertinent flight information and disseminating
     such information to applicable aircrews. These procedures apply collectively to the 305 OG and 514
     OG.
        9.12.2.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) OG/OGV maintains a master Flight Crew Information File (FCIF)
        according to AFI 11-202V2, and will provide an updated index to the squadrons as required.
        9.12.2.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Flying squadrons and CCTS are authorized by this chapter to
        maintain an active FCIF aircrew read file. Other organizations can be granted authorization at the
        discretion of OGV. Request procedures should be outlined in program/process guides.
        9.12.2.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Squadrons are prohibited from initiating and inserting items into
        the FCIF without OG/OGV concurrence. However, squadrons are encouraged to develop their
        own read files.
        9.12.2.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) Responsibilities. The Chief OG/OGV is the OPR for establishing
        the aircrew FCIF programs. All FCIF related programs will be managed by OGV and unit level
        program/process guides. Specifically, OG/OGV will:
            9.12.2.4.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Publish FCIF items as required per AFI 11-202V2, AFI
            11-202V2/AMCSUP1 and applicable local directives. FCIF items will remain posted until
            rescinded, removed after an expiration/withdrawal date or incorporated into the Flight Crew
            Bulletin (FCB) or other appropriate publication. OG/OGV will distribute FCIFs and Special
            Interest Guides to all appropriate agencies.
            9.12.2.4.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Ensure items are posted such that the most recent item
            directly follows the index. The FCIF indexes will be updated as necessary to reflect the current
            contents of the FCIF binder.
            9.12.2.4.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Periodically review the effectiveness of each squadron’s air-
            crew FCIF program to ensure compliance with AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-202V2/AMCSUP1 and
            this chapter.
            9.12.2.4.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) Quarterly review current FCIF information and incorporate
            into FCBs where applicable. Refer to OGV FCB Program Guide for further guidance.
AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                              55


     9.12.2.5. (Added-MCGUIRE) The Chiefs, squadron Stan/Eval are the OPR for implementing
     their respective squadron program. Specifically, the Chief of each squadron Stan/Eval will:
         9.12.2.5.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Ensure an effective FCIF program is conducted in their
         respective squadron. Periodically review their squadron’s FCIF program to ensure compliance
         with AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-202V2/AMCSUP1 and this chapter.
         9.12.2.5.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Ensure each individual assigned or attached to their squadron
         for flight operations has an individual AMC Form 396. The AMC Form 396 is valid until full.
         Squadrons will prepare the AMC Form 396 with the individual’s name, grade, and crew posi-
         tion. The AMC Form 396 will be filed alphabetically by crew position in a central location
         within each squadron. (For AE units, unit can file AMC Form 396 alphabetically by squadron
         without regard to crew position.)
  9.12.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Go/No-Go Procedures. Each squadron DOV will consolidate and over-
  see procedures for daily administration of a Go-No-Go program. The program will include interaction
  of squadron standardization, training, scheduling, flight management, safety, and the director of oper-
  ations. DOV will ensure all appropriate mechanisms are in place and functioning for proper review of
  all mission launches.
     9.12.3.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Below is a list of basic items to include for consideration in the
     Go-/No-Go process:
         9.12.3.1.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Crew qualifications.
         9.12.3.1.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Crew certifications.
         9.12.3.1.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Operational Risk Management analysis (ORM).
         9.12.3.1.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) Scheduling considerations and restrictions (i.e. crew rest,
         PMCR).
         9.12.3.1.5. (Added-MCGUIRE) Currency/Mission Ready status.
         9.12.3.1.6. (Added-MCGUIRE) Flight physical/DNIF/Chamber.
         9.12.3.1.7. (Added-MCGUIRE) FCIF/Intel/Theater indoctrination Briefs.
         9.12.3.1.8. (Added-MCGUIRE) Force Protection.
         9.12.3.1.9. (Added-MCGUIRE) Specific mission requirements.
     9.12.3.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Refer to unit program guide for additional guidance.
  9.12.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) Completion/Documentation of Flight Evaluation Requisites. Evalua-
  tions will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202 V2, appropriate supplements and weapon system specific
  AFI 11-2MDS-Specific V2. If conflicting guidance is identified, contact OGV for resolution.
     9.12.4.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Initial qualification evaluations should be scheduled for daytime
     hours to the maximum extent possible.
     9.12.4.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Documentation. The AF Form 3862 will be used for documenting
     all aircrew evaluations. 305th and 514th OGs may use different overprints.
         9.12.4.2.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Flight examiners will ensure sufficient information is anno-
         tated on the evaluation worksheet to accurately recreate the flight and to easily determine the
56                                           AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003


        remaining events required to complete an evaluation. This ensures all required sub areas are
        evaluated and accurately reflect the examinee’s performance. The evaluation worksheet fur-
        ther serves as the basis for mission debriefing and trend analysis. Squadron Stan/Eval will
        monitor flight evaluation accomplishment and requisite completion. The evaluation worksheet
        will be signed by the evaluator prior to filing in the FEF.
        9.12.4.2.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Specific entries will mirror those in the applicable AFI
        11-2MDS-Specific V2 series regulation. Additional grading areas such as special interest
        items or local evaluation requirements are authorized entries, but will be coordinated with 305
        OG/OGV prior to including them on the AF Form 3862 (NA 514 OG). Current AF Form 3862s
        with approved local entries are located on the 305 OGV web page and are maintained IAW the
        Evaluation Program guidance. Blank AF Form 3862 can be downloaded from the AF Forms
        website.
     9.12.4.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Grading Criteria. Specific grading criteria are outlined in AFI
     11-2MDS-Specific V2. Adherence to these procedures and criteria provides an accurate assess-
     ment of the proficiency and capability of aircrews in the performance of their flying duties. Flight
     examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed grading criteria and use it when con-
     ducting evaluations. Use of these criteria will ensure standard and objective evaluations are
     administered to crewmembers.
        9.12.4.3.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) The flight examiner will compare the examinee’s perfor-
        mance with the tolerances provided in the grading criteria and will assign an appropriate grade
        for each sub area. In some cases, momentary deviations may be acceptable, however, cumula-
        tive deviations must be considered. The judgment of the flight examiner and the guidance con-
        tained in the grading criteria form the basis for the grade awarded for any flight evaluation.
        The examinee will be thoroughly critiqued with respect to all aspects of the flight. During this
        critique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, sub
        area(s), grade(s) assigned, and any additional training which the examinee will be required to
        complete.
        9.12.4.3.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) All evaluations graded less than Q-1 (Q-2 or Q-3) will nor-
        mally be reported to the examinee’s commander and to any OGV representative within 24
        hours. All units will forward to OG/OGV within three duty days (by next UTA for AE
        Reserves) a draft (unsigned) copy of any AF Form 8 graded less than Q-1 (including adminis-
        trative downgrades) and EXCEPTIONALLY QUALIFIED. A signed copy, when completed,
        will be forwarded to 305 OGV. Note: If an evaluator has any question(s) about a particular
        evaluation before making their final decision, OGV is always available to offer assistance or
        guidance.
     9.12.4.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) Evaluation Briefings. A thorough pre-brief and debrief are vital
     components in the evaluation process.
        9.12.4.4.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) The flight examiner will brief the examinee on the conduct,
        purpose, tolerances and the grading of the flight. See AFI 11-2MDS-Specific V2 or OGV
        Evaluator Guide to assist examiners in preparing, administering, and critiquing evaluations.
        9.12.4.4.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) The squadron commander, operations officer, or flight com-
        mander/flight supervisor should attend all debriefs. During normal duty hours, supervisory
        attendance is required for activity less than Q1 (recommended for the 514 OG but not
AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                             57


         required). After duty hours, debrief the supervisor within 24 hours or on next duty day. The
         Form 8 will be documented with supervisory attendance in Section A. In addition, all debrief-
         ings involving KC-10 initial qualifications/upgrades will include a like-specialty representa-
         tive from CCTS (N/A 514 OG).
         9.12.4.4.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Squadron commanders or their designated representative will
         brief the OG/CC when any flight evaluation is graded unqualified.
  9.12.5. (Added-MCGUIRE) AF Form 8 routing and filing to include reviewing and approving offi-
  cials. Squadrons will develop a program that details the procedures to complete, review, file and
  ensure quality control of the AF Form 8.
     9.12.5.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) AF Form 8s should normally be completed and signed within 21
     calendar days from the completion of the evaluation, barring extended TDYs, contingencies, etc.
     (514 OG – 60 days) Additionally, 305 OGV and 514 OGV require a copy of AF Form 8s for any
     evaluation graded other than Q-1 (Q-2, Q-3, or “Exceptionally Qualified”).
     9.12.5.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) AF Form 8 Processing. The evaluator or Stan/Eval Liaison Officer
     (SELO) will complete the AF Form 8, check it for accuracy, and input data for Trends Analyses.
     Forward the Form 8 to the flight examiner, reviewing officer and final approving officer for dates
     and signatures. The examiner signs and dates the AF Form 8 first and the individual signs and
     dates last. .
     9.12.5.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) AF Form 8 reviewing and approving officials. Normally, the
     reviewing official on the AF Form 8 is the DOV Chief, and the approving official is the Squadron
     Commander. For attached crewmembers, other than OGV personnel, the reviewing and final
     approving officers are the same as for squadron assigned personnel. For OGV personnel, the
     reviewing officer is the Chief of OGV, and the final approving officer is the OG/CC. Additional
     guidance is available in AFI 11-202V2/AMCSup1, paragraph 7.3.6.2.1. (514 OG follow OG/CC
     policy letter).
     9.12.5.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) The Standardization and Evaluation Management System Program
     (SEMSPro) is a highly recommended tool to aid in the completion of the AF Form 8. Units will
     use SEMSPro tracker or squadron-developed logs to track routing and completion of AF Forms 8.
     Detailed instructions on the SEMSPRO program can be found in the appropriate FEF Program/
     process guide. Network access/management issues are also addressed in the guide.
  9.12.6. (Added-MCGUIRE) Certification. The aircrew certification program ensures safe and effi-
  cient flight operations through a systematic review of individual qualifications prior to conducting
  flight operations. This process includes a review of any crewmember not meeting minimum flying
  proficiency standards.
     9.12.6.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) The respective Chief of Squadron Stan/Eval is responsible for
     defining a squadron certification program. Working in conjunction with squadron training, he/she
     will determine the scope of the squadron certification program, publish guidance detailing the pro-
     gram, oversee the certification process, and ensure proper documentation of all certifications.
     9.12.6.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) The squadron certification program will include a list of certifica-
     tions crewmembers can attain. This list will be maintained, reviewed, and updated periodically
     through coordination with training and will be referenced when accomplishing AF Form 1381
     entries. OG/OGV will maintain a current list of potential certifications for each crew position.
58                                              AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003


        This list will be reviewed annually with OGT and updated to reflect new certifications and to
        remove certifications crewmembers can no longer attain. This will allow OGV coordination on all
        potential certifications.
        9.12.6.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Review and Certification Boards are conducted at the squadron
        level.
        9.12.6.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) OG/CC Interview. The 305 OG/CC interview allows new aircraft
        commanders an opportunity to personally meet their group commander, gain his/her perspective
        on pertinent issues, further their understanding of 305 OG operations, and resolve any questions
        they might have. This interview is for pilots gaining Aircraft Commander qualification for the first
        time in their respective aircraft, regardless of previous aircraft experience, and must be completed
        prior to designating that individual as Pilot in Command (PIC) for any flight. (The reserve associ-
        ate wing/group commander will perform 514 OG final certification for aircraft commanders and
        flight examiners. Pilots will not be designated PIC and flight examiners will not perform examiner
        duties until the certification is completed. Squadrons follow 514 OG administrative procedures for
        the certification process.)
     9.12.7. (Added-MCGUIRE) Theater Indoctrination: The purpose of the Theater Indoctrination pro-
     gram is to provide crewmembers with the most up-to-date planning tools on their travel locations.
     Refer to the OGV Oversight Program for additional guidance.

                       RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO AF PUBLICATIONS

A5.1. General . The stan/eval function is responsible for the orderly and efficient processing of recom-
mended changes to Air Force publications at each command level. Unless different guidance is provided
by the appropriate AF publication OPR, submit recommended changes and improvements to Air Force
publications on AF Form 847 according to the procedures below and in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3 (cov-
ering completion of the Form). Submit recommended changes for conditions that have negative effects on
operational efficiency, to correct content errors or to recommend improved procedures or processes. Do
not use the AF Form 847 to call attention to typographical, printing or quality errors unless they cause
misinterpretation. Such deficiencies can be remedied by direct communication with the AF publication
OPR.

A5.2. Processing AF Forms 847.
     A5.2.1. Submit and process all AF Forms 847 through MAJCOM channels as outlined in the MAJ-
     COM supplement to this instruction, in accordance with routing as outlined in Figure A6.1. and in
     compliance with instructions in AFI 11-215, Attachment 3. ANG units will utilize the NAF/MAJ-
     COM command structure with oversight responsibility. Units will submit AF Form 847s electroni-
     cally to the maximum extent possible.
     A5.2.2. At each level the stan/eval function will document receipt of original AF Forms 847, ensure
     the AF Form 847 reaches the appropriate functional OPR at that level for review, forward approved
     original AF Forms 847 to the next command level while informing the preceding command level of
     disposition (positive and negative) with comments. The advent of electronic Forms 847 may allow
     each level to inform all levels below (including the originator) of such disposition. The goal is to keep
     each command level and the originator advised of the progress and disposition of a submitted AF
     Form 847.
     A5.2.3. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will forward the reviewed original AF Form 847 to
     the AF publication OPR. Once the AF publication OPR decides on disposition of the AF Form 847,
     the AF publication OPR will notify the submitting, parent MAJCOM as to disposition. The parent
     MAJCOM will then inform the lower command levels of the disposition of the original AF Form 847.
     A5.2.4. The parent MAJCOM of the originator will simultaneously forward information copies of AF
     Forms 847 to all other MAJCOMs that utilize the subject AF publication. The other using MAJCOMs
     may forward comments on the information AF Form 847 suggestions to the AF publication OPR.
     A5.2.5. An AF Form 847 may be disapproved by any command level reviewing the original AF Form
     847. All disapproved recommendations will be returned to the submitting command level with justifi-
     cation annotated on the AF Form 847 stating the reason for the disapproval. MAJCOMs may address
     how to resubmit an AF Form 847 disapproved at a command level below the AF publication OPR in
     their supplement to this instruction.
     A5.2.6. The movement and disposition of the original AF Form 847 will be tracked by the stan/eval
     function at all command levels that review the original AF Form 847. There is no requirement to track
     receipt or disposition of information copies of an AF Form 847.

                                    Attachment 7 (Added-MCGUIRE)

                       305 OGV CAPSTONE DOCUMENT FOR PROGRAMS

A7.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) This Capstone document describes the structure and implementation of the
key programs within the Stan/Eval function of the 305th Operations Group. It applies to the conduct of
operations within the 305 OG/OGV and provides guidance to lower echelons on the implementation of
the overall stan/eval function. From this, all affected units can identify and build programs and supporting
processes related to the accomplishment of the 305 OG mission. Use this document at an attachment to
the Stan/Eval Local Procedures Supplement.

A7.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) General . All process guides used in OGV will be developed using guid-
ance in this document and Chapter 9 of AFI 11-202 Vol 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program.
305 OG/OGV will work closely with the 514 OG to establish linked processes for mutual support and
implementation of their programs. This guide consolidates the key programs outlined in formal instruc-
tions as well as those identified by OGV. From these programs will naturally flow supporting processes.
This guide is an aid in the development and continuity documentation of those processes. Echelons below
Ops Group level may supplement the OGV programs to better define their local processes.

A7.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Guide Management.
     A7.3.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Program Development/Implementation: Each program defined in this
     guide will have a manager designated by the appropriate echelon chief. The program manager is
     responsible for the development and implementation of all processes supporting that program. These
     support processes will be identified in the program guide and fully developed in a process continuity
     guide. The manager is also responsible for assisting lower echelons in further supplementing/defining
     the process for their level. The echelon chief will review and approve all programs for their respective
     level.
     A7.3.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Review and Revision: The program manager will review the program
     guide and support process guides for content and currency at least annually. As a guide, use the anni-
     versary date of the guide as the target review time frame. Annotate all reviews, updates and actions on
     a Review/Action Log. Maintain the log in the program guide. All Stan/Eval personnel should be
     familiar with each program and its support processes. Additional documented reviews are at the eche-
     lon chief’s discretion.

A7.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) Key Programs. The 305 OG/OGV has identified 13 key program areas that
support the standardization and evaluation function. The programs are functionally oriented and are
derived from guidance in applicable higher echelon instructions. Squadrons and echelons below Ops
Group level may supplement the current list of programs:
     A7.4.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Administration. The purpose of the administration program is to detail
     the day-to-day operations of the stan/eval office. It covers office policies, scheduling, division of
     duties, assignment of OPR to key programs, and other processes that support the Operations Group
     and echelon commanders.
     A7.4.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Evaluations. The Evaluation program outlines the standardization and
     conduct of aircrew recurring evaluations. It includes processes such as scenario development, check
AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003                                                                81


  ride prebrief and debriefing, check ride data collection and support materials, and the logging and
  tracking of evaluations. The pyramid evaluation process is managed under this program. It is closely
  linked to the FEF and Trends programs.
  A7.4.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Special Evaluations. This program covers the implementation of the
  Group No-Notice and supplemental evaluations plans. Echelons with outline the criteria for identifi-
  cation of no-notice evaluation recipient. Establishment and conduct of supplemental evaluations will
  be outlined to include use of data collected. This program is closely linked to the Trends and SEB pro-
  grams.
  A7.4.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) Flight Evaluation Folders (FEF). The FEF program governs the collec-
  tion and recording of qualification and certification data. It encompasses every aspect of a crewmem-
  bers’ flight evaluation folder to include the generation of Form 8s, maintenance and care of the
  SEMSPro Program and Stan Eval Network Access Drive.
  A7.4.5. (Added-MCGUIRE) Certifications: The Certification program is the foundation for identify-
  ing and tracking crewmember qualifications beyond the formal qualifications. It is a key link between
  the organization’s training and standardization functions. The program includes the identification of
  local in addition to directed certifications, the process for Review and Certification of crewmembers
  by competent organizational authorities, and the rulebook for maintenance and tracking of those cer-
  tifications. The program relies heavily on good communication and interaction with the organization
  training. It is closely linked to the FEF and Oversight programs.
  A7.4.6. (Added-MCGUIRE) Trends: The trend program is a key indicator in the health of various
  processes within the stan/eval function. It guides the collection and analysis of data as well as the
  identification and implementation of corrective actions. This program extends beyond crewmember
  check ride issues. It encompasses analysis of Crosstell information for other unit inspections, Special
  Interest Item/Area from high echelons, written examination trends as well as flight evaluations. This
  program has ties to the SEB and Special Evaluations Programs
  A7.4.7. (Added-MCGUIRE) Stan/Eval Board (SEB): The SEB program is the local implementation
  of the overlying directives. It describes coordination and execution of the board system. The SEB has
  critical linkage to nearly all programs in the stan/eval function.
  A7.4.8. (Added-MCGUIRE) Testing: The Stan/Eval testing program implements guidance of the
  overlying directives. It encompasses the management of both the requisite examinations for crew-
  members and the supplemental testing process. The program defines the test control, review cycle,
  error identification and trend collection. It feeds the Trend and SEB programs
  A7.4.9. (Added-MCGUIRE) FCIF: The FCIF Program manages the processes associated with the
  aircrew FCIF library. This includes content and upkeep of the library itself, execution of the active
  FCIF Safety and Read Files as well as the Flight Crew Bulletin process. In conjunction with the Pub-
  lications and Manuals program, it describes the posting and formatting of library publications. The
  publishing and administration of the active FCIF is also detailed with regard to format, duration and
  applicability rules and the periodic review of the file. This program is closely linked with the Publica-
  tions and Manuals program.
  A7.4.10. (Added-MCGUIRE) Publications/Manuals: The Publications and Manuals program out-
  lines the management of processes dealing with aircrew publications and associated directives. It
  defines the Consolidated Manuals Office (CMO) process and provides for the acquisition of aircrew
  publications for both the 305th Operations Group and the 514th Operations Group as well as the
82                                              AFI11-2O2V2_MCGUIREAFBSUP1_I 23 MAY 2003


     responsibilities of lower echelons. Pubs/Manuals is also responsible for the content and guidance for
     use of the weapons system mission kits. It is closely linked to the FCIF program.
     A7.4.11. (Added-MCGUIRE) Waivers/Authorizations: This program describes the OGV involve-
     ment in coordination of actions requiring special approvals. The purpose is to directly advise/support
     the OG/CC in the decision-making processes. It describes authority levels, routing and formatting for
     requests generated below group level. It also gives guidance on reference sources for lower echelon
     action officers.
     A7.4.12. (Added-MCGUIRE) Oversight: The Oversight program includes those processes that
     ensure compliance of lower echelons with regard to standardization and qualification issues. This
     includes the Functional Check Flight process, the mission generation Go-No-Go process and the Stan-
     dardization/Evaluation Assistance Visit (SAV) process. The SAV and FCF processes are primarily the
     responsibility of the OGV. Execution of the Go-No-Go process is the primary responsibility of the
     squadron echelon. Guidance is given as a resource for the squadrons to build a process tuned to their
     needs.
     A7.4.13. (Added-MCGUIRE) Support Functions: The Support Function Program captures under one
     umbrella the major processes that the stan/eval function uses to support the group mission. Each ech-
     elon should identify and describe the processes applicable to their echelon. The processes are not
     intended to give direction to lower echelons. However, if a particular process involves participation
     from a lower echelon, that involvement will be described. The lower echelon may also have the same
     process identified under their Support Functions Program. For example, RAMROD is an OGV-level
     process but the squadrons provide support to OGV in accomplishment of those duties. Other examples
     of Support Functions are EET, C-Check Acceptance, Web management, Recognition, etc.

                      514 OGV CAPSTONE DOCUMENT FOR PROGRAMS

A8.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) This Capstone document describes the structure and implementation of the
key programs within the Stan/Eval function of the 514th Operations Group. It applies to the conduct of
operations within the 514 OG/OGV and provides guidance to lower echelons on the implementation of
the overall stan/eval function. From this, all affected units can identify and build programs and supporting
processes related to the accomplishment of the 514 OG mission. Use this document as an attachment to
the Stan/Eval Local Procedures Supplement.

A8.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) General. All process guides used in OGV will be developed using guidance
in this document and Chapter 9 of AFI 11-202 V2. The 514 OG/OGV will work closely with the 305 OG
to establish linked processes for mutual support and implementation of their processes. This guide consol-
idates the key processes outlined in formal instructions as well as those identified by OGV. From these
programs will naturally flow supporting processes. This guide is an aid in the development and continuity
documentation of those processes. Echelons below Ops Group level may supplement the OGV programs
to better define their local processes.

A8.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) Guide Management.
   A8.3.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Program Development/Implementation: Each program defined in this
   guide will have a manager designated by the appropriate echelon chief. The program manager is
   responsible for the development and implementation of the process. Processes will be identified and
   fully developed in a process continuity guide. The manager is also responsible for assisting lower ech-
   elons in further supplementing/defining the process for their level. The echelon chief will review and
   approve all programs for their respective level.
   A8.3.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Review and Revision: The program manager will review the program
   guide and support process guides for content and currency at least annually. As a guide, use the anni-
   versary date of the process as the target review time frame. Annotate all reviews, updates and actions
   on a Review/Action Log. Maintain the log in the process. All Stan/Eval personnel should be familiar
   with each process. Additional documented reviews are at the echelon chief’s discretion.

A8.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) Key Programs. The 514 OG/OGV has identified 13 key process areas that
support the standardization and evaluation function. The processes are functionally oriented and are
derived from guidance in applicable higher echelon instructions. Squadrons and echelons below Ops
Group level may supplement the current list of processes:
   A8.4.1. (Added-MCGUIRE) Administration. The purpose of the administration process is to detail
   the day-to-day operations of the stan/eval office. It covers office policies, scheduling, division of
   duties, assignment of OPR to key programs, and other processes that support the Operations Group
   and echelon commanders. 514 OG process also includes supplementary evaluation program, MEGP
   issues, and attachment letters.
   A8.4.2. (Added-MCGUIRE) Stan/Eval Board. The SEB process is the local implementation of the
   overlying directives. It describes coordination and execution of the board system. The SEB has criti-

     cal linkage to nearly all processes in the stan/eval function. The 514 OG SEB also includes the 514
     OG/OGV waiver log and EQ log.
     A8.4.3. (Added-MCGUIRE) R & C Board. The R&C Board is the process for Review and Certifica-
     tion of crewmembers by competent organizational authorities, and the rulebook for maintenance and
     tracking of those certifications. The process relies heavily on good communication and interaction
     with the training office.
     A8.4.4. (Added-MCGUIRE) Flight Evaluation Folder Worksheet. The FEF worksheet process gov-
     erns the collection and recording of qualification and certification data. It encompasses every aspect
     of a crewmembers’ flight evaluation folder. A current list of 514 OG certifications is maintained by
     this process.
     A8.4.5. (Added-MCGUIRE) AF Form 8. The AF Form 8 process includes generation of AF Forms 8,
     maintenance and care of the SEMSPRO program, and compliance with all applicable regulations to
     include the 305/514 AMW Form 8 Guide.
     A8.4.6. (Added-MCGUIRE) Trend Analysis. The trend analysis process is a key indicator of the
     health of various processes within the stan/eval function. It guides collection and analysis of data as
     well as the identification and implementation of corrective actions. The process encompasses check
     rides, Cross tell information, Special Interest Items/Areas, written examinations and contractor (ATD)
     input. The process is tied to the SEB.
     A8.4.7. (Added-MCGUIRE) No-Notice. This process covers the implementation and reporting of the
     Group no-notice evaluations. It is tied to the SEB.
     A8.4.8. (Added-MCGUIRE) Flight Manuals. The Flight Manuals process outlines the management
     of aircrew publications and associated directives. It provides for the acquisition of aircrew publica-
     tions for the 514th Operations Group as well as the responsibilities of lower echelons (squadrons). It
     is closely linked to the FCIF program.
     A8.4.9. (Added-MCGUIRE) AF Form 847. The AF Form 847 process describes the formal feedback
     process to higher echelons for aircrews to identify weaknesses and suggestions for publications and
     manuals. The process outlines the coordination and routing requirements as well as sources for
     updates on status of submitted requests. The AF Form 847 processes have linkage to the Pubs/Manu-
     als program and the SEB programs.
     A8.4.10. (Added-MCGUIRE) Mission Kits. The mission kit process defines the scope, contents and
     responsibilities of all 514 OG mission kits. It is closely linked to Flight Manuals and the FCIF.
     A8.4.11. (Added-MCGUIRE) FCIF. The FCIF Process manages the aircrew FCIF library. This
     includes content and upkeep of the library itself, execution of the active FCIF Safety and Read Files
     as well as the Flight Crew Bulletin process. In conjunction with the Publications and Manuals process,
     it describes the posting and formatting of library publications. The publishing and administration of
     the active FCIF is also detailed with regard to format, duration and applicability rules and the periodic
     review of the file. This process is closely linked with the Publications and Manuals process.
     A8.4.12. (Added-MCGUIRE) Aircrew Testing: The Stan/Eval testing process implements guidance
     of the overlying directives. It encompasses the management of both the requisite examinations for
     crewmembers and the supplemental testing process. The process defines the test control, review cycle,
     error identification and trend collection. It feeds the Trend and SEB programs. 514 OG/OGV AE test
     managers develop open book exams for each AE unit.

  A8.4.13. (Added-MCGUIRE) Manning/Flight Examiner Qualification. The Flight Examiner process
  defines the upgrade requirements as well as the overall 514 OG flight examiner manning status. It is
  reported at the SEB.
