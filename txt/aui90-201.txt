SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.

This instruction has been significantly changed to reflect responsibilities of units and functions
under Air University (AU) with respect to establishing and maintaining a Self-Assessment
Program (SAP). This instruction assigns overall responsibility for the SAP to Commanders. The
instruction defines AU organizations as either Center (or Equivalents) or as Subordinate Units
and outlines responsibilities for AU/IG as well as for Commanders, and SAP Managers at all
levels. Additionally, this instruction embraces the electronic records management processes
(Attachment 2). This instruction contains a self-assessment checklist (SAC) (Attachment 4).
This instruction also requires OPRs to use a structured problem solving approach with Root
Cause Analyses (RCA) to determine underlying problems and in developing solutions for self-
assessment discrepancies (Paragraph 4.4.2 and Attachment 7).

1. Purpose. This instruction implements the Air University’s Self-Assessment Program (SAP)
which is modeled after the Air Force’s inspection system as described in AFI 90-201.

   1.1. Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT). Automation of all SAP requirements
   via MICT is mandatory. MICT is an Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) computer-based
   automatic tracking system used to track compliance. The MICT database is a web based
   program accessed through the Air Force Portal.

   1.2. MICT Program. This program will be used for tracking deficiencies, discrepancies,
   and problem areas identified from many sources. They include: AETC Unit Compliance
   Inspections (UCIs); Compliance Inspections (CIs); Operational Readiness Inspections
   (ORIs); Headquarters AU Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs); Air Education Training Command
   (AETC) Special Interest Items (SIIs); Commander interest items (CIIs); Command Emphasis
   Areas (CEAs); Management Internal Control Program (MICP); internally developed
   checklists; and any other inspection requirements not mentioned here.

      1.2.1. The Air Force’s inspection system has two major purposes. The first purpose is to
      report on a unit’s readiness to perform its assigned mission or to report on a unit’s
      compliance with regulatory guidelines and operating procedures. The second purpose is
      to help the unit and the Air Force improve by identifying discrepancies that require
      attention. The inspection system includes a methodology to ensure those discrepancies
      are addressed at an appropriate level ranging from the inspected unit to its higher
      headquarters or even at Headquarters Air Force.

      1.2.2. The SAP is a commander’s program.                   Within Air University,
      Commanders/Agency Directors are responsible for Self-Assessment Programs within
      their unit IAW with the guidelines established in AFI 90-201 as supplemented by this
      instruction.

      1.2.3. AFI 90-201, Para 5.8.1.4 establishes the requirement for all Air Force commanders
      to establish and manage a unit Self-Assessment Program and conduct self-assessments
      using HAF self-assessment checklists (SAC), once established. Units are required to
      identify deficiency codes listed in AFI 90-201 (attachment 7) for deficiencies discovered
      during self-assessments. AFI 90-201 grants each unit the latitude to tailor its programs to
      meet its needs. AFI 90-201 also directs the use of the AF 8-Step problem solving model,
      or other RCA tools, to identify root causes and solutions to deficiencies.

      1.2.4. A viable SAP sets the stage for the unit to respond to no-notice inspections by
      ensuring commanders remain aware of how well their units are complying with USAF
      requirements.

          usage are complied with.

3. Training.

   3.1. To execute the SAP requires two separate types of training. The first focuses on SAP
   processes. The second focuses on the AF 8-Step Problem Solving Process.

      3.1.1. SAP process training

          3.1.1.1. Center SAPMs will train the Center’s designated interest item OPR on self-
          assessment processes associated with the interest item.
8                                                           AUI90-201 12 NOVEMBER 2013

          3.1.1.2. All SAPMs complete SAPM training with next higher level SAPM within 1
          month of being assigned as a SAPM.

          3.1.1.3. Prior to initiating a self-assessment, the SAPM will train the inspectors that
          will execute the self-assessment within the unit.

              3.1.1.3.1. To ensure the inspectors use current SACs.

              3.1.1.3.2. To ensure inspectors understand the documentation requirements for
              MICT and attachment 5 of this instruction.

              3.1.1.3.3. By reviewing the results of past assessments with inspectors including:

                   3.1.1.3.3.1. The most recent HHQ inspection on that unit.

                   3.1.1.3.3.2. HHQ inspections on other AETC units.

                   3.1.1.3.3.3. All self-assessments since the last HHQ inspection.

                   3.1.1.3.3.4. This review serves to focus inspectors on specific issues that
                   require attention to ensure previously implemented fixes are still effective.

                   3.1.1.3.3.5. This review also serves to help inspectors identify repeat
                   discrepancies.

                   3.1.1.3.3.6. This review also serves to help inspectors identify discrepancies
                   that may become trend items within AETC, within AU, the Center, or within
                   the subordinate unit.

       3.1.2. AF 8-Step Problem Solving Methodology training.

          3.1.2.1. All SAPMs will obtain training in the AF 8-Step problem solving
          methodology and document completion of that training in their SAP electronic
          records.

          3.1.2.2. SAPMs may obtain this training from either AU/CCO or from an AFSO 21
          Level I trained and certified individual.

          3.1.2.3. This hierarchy of training ensures that SAPMs have adequate expertise to
          assist OPRs work through root cause analysis and develop solutions to the underlying
          problems rather than simply providing relief from the symptoms discovered in the
          self-assessment.

4. Self-Assessment Execution.

    4.1. Timing.

       4.1.1. AU organizations will conduct semi-annual self-assessments using MICT.
AUI90-201 12 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  9

        4.1.1.1. These assessments will be conducted between 1 January to 1 March and 1
        June to 1 August or when appropriate based on unique requirements. Results will be
        due to AU/IG NLT 15 April and 15 October.

        4.1.1.2. At more frequent intervals on specific programs if dictated within the
        instructions governing those programs.

        4.1.1.3. Commanders at all levels have the authority to direct their unit and their
        subordinate units to conduct self-assessments at additional times.

  4.2. Preparation.

     4.2.1. SAPMs will ensure the SACs are current.

        4.2.1.1. The AU SAC for the AU Self-Assessment Program is at Attachment 4 of this
        instruction.

        4.2.1.2. All available SACs can found within MICT.

        4.2.1.3. AETC/IG and the AETC Functional Staff are responsible for the currency of
        AETC/IG SACs.

            4.2.1.3.1. If SAPMs determine that an AETC/IG SAC is outdated, they should
            notify AU/IG and the applicable FAM.

                4.2.1.3.1.1. AU/IG will coordinate with AETC/IG to obtain current SAC.

                4.2.1.3.1.2. If AETC/IG does not have a current checklist, the unit should
                comply with paragraph 4.2.1.5 below.

        4.2.1.4. Units may supplement HHQ checklists to meet unit requirements.

        4.2.1.5. Not all scenarios are covered by a HHQ SAC. In those situations, the units
        are encouraged to develop SACs as required.

            4.2.1.5.1. SAPMs will review all unit developed SACs to ensure they reflect
            current guidance and meet AFI requirements.

     4.2.2. Prior to initiating a self-assessment, SAPMs will train the unit’s inspectors IAW
     paragraph 3.

  4.3. Execution.

     4.3.1. Assessors use checklists to document the inspection within MICT.

        4.3.1.1. Make notes within the checklist. (See Attachment 5 – Sample Checklists).

        4.3.1.2. If a checklist item requires a document, look specifically for that document
        and annotate its location within the checklist. Note: If the assessed agency has the
10                                                           AUI90-201 12 NOVEMBER 2013

           document but has a difficult time locating it, annotate that difficulty as a
           Recommended Improvement Area.

           4.3.1.3. If a checklist requires the assessor to evaluate a process, then make notes
           within the checklist that the evaluated agency’s process complies with the appropriate
           guidance once compliance is shown.

           4.3.1.4. Annotate the checklist for all discrepancies corrected on the spot. This
           action lays the foundation for identifying repeat discrepancies in subsequent
           assessments.

           4.3.1.5. Assessors should review the document trail for all actions taken to correct
           discrepancies identified during previous HHQ inspections, SAVs, and self-
           assessments. If that document trail is not available for review, then annotate the
           checklist accordingly.

        4.3.2. REPEAT Discrepancies Defined:

           4.3.2.1. Previously identified discrepancies that are still open will be annotated as
           REPEAT.

           4.4.3.2.2. Previously identified discrepancies that had been closed but recurred will
           be annotated as REPEAT. This includes those minor discrepancies that were
           corrected on the spot during a prior self-assessment.

     4.4. Follow-up.

        4.4.1. Process for determining the appropriate level to track/correct/close findings.

           4.4.1.1. The SAPM and the Commander will consider the following in determining
           whether to elevate the discrepancy or to retain the discrepancy at that level.

               4.4.1.1.1. Repeat Discrepancies

                   4.4.1.1.1.1. Subordinate Unit Commanders            will   elevate   all     repeat
                   discrepancies to the next higher level SAPM.

                   4.4.1.1.1.2. Center Commanders may retain repeat discrepancies at the Center
                   level or elevate them to AU.

               4.4.1.1.2. Commanders should elevate discrepancies that indicate issues beyond
               their control.

               4.4.1.1.3. Commanders should consider elevating issues that require assistance
               from the higher echelon in order to close the discrepancy in a timely manner.
AUI90-201 12 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                  11

            4.4.1.1.4. SAPMs and Commanders will establish appropriate timelines for
            completing corrective actions to findings that will be tracked/corrected/closed at
            their level (see 4.4.3.3.).

        4.4.1.2. SAPMs will review completed SACs with the assessors:

            4.4.1.2.1. To determine the adequacy of the assessment or to require an area to be
            re-assessed or to require the inspector to adequately complete the documentation
            of the assessment.

            4.4.1.2.2. To gain the assessor’s insight on whether to recommend findings be
            tracked/closed at the unit level or elevated to the next higher level unit.

            4.4.1.2.3. To gain the assessor’s insight on an appropriate OPR to work the
            discrepancy.

        4.4.1.3. SAPMs will brief the unit commander on the results of the self-assessment.

            4.4.1.3.1. SAPM will recommend disposition of discrepancies to the commander.

            4.4.1.3.2. Commanders will decide which discrepancies will be
            tracked/corrected/ closed at their level and which discrepancies will be elevated to
            the next higher echelon. Based on the Commander’s decision, SAPMs will
            forward the appropriate discrepancies to the next higher level SAPM.

            4.4.1.3.3. SAPMs and Commanders will establish appropriate timelines for
            completing     corrective     actions   to discrepancies that will    be
            tracked/corrected/closed at that level.

            4.4.1.3.4. SAPMs will recommend unit OPRs to correct the discrepancy for the
            Commander’s decision.

     4.4.2. Process for correcting discrepancies

        4.4.2.1. For discrepancies that the commander decides warrants the use of the AF 8-
        Step process, use the format in Attachment 6 to document the corrective actions. The
        format creates a “document trail” of actions and decisions enroute to closing the
        discrepancy. The format creates this trail by requiring the OPR to append new
        actions and decisions at the end of the document thereby preserving the prior
        information.

        4.4.2.2. The OPR will identify a discrepancy code from AFI 90-201, Atch 7, for each
        discrepancy. The AF 8-Step Problem Solving Process referenced in AFI 90-201, Para
        2.20.10 and outlined in the following paragraphs provides a useful methodology to
        determine root causes and identify which deficiency code best applies to the
        deficiency.
12                                                      AUI90-201 12 NOVEMBER 2013

        4.4.2.2.1. Clarify and validate the problem – Clearly define/describe the problem.
        Create the problem statement.

        4.4.2.2.2. Break down the problem – Is this one issue or are there multiple issues?
        Do you have the right data to support your problem statement? What is the
        current status?

        4.4.2.2.3. Set improvement targets. What is the current requirement/standard?

        4.4.2.2.4. Determine the underlying cause that allowed the discrepancy to occur.
        The OPR will use a root cause analysis to determine which of the AFI 90-201 root
        discrepancy codes located at Attachment 7 apply to the discrepancy.

            4.4.2.2.4.1. When requested, SAPM assists the OPR assigned to a
            discrepancy apply the AF 8-Step Problem Solving Process.

        4.4.2.2.5. Develop countermeasures (solutions) that address the underlying root
        causes.

        4.4.2.2.6. Implement the countermeasure (solution) or fix to the root cause.

        4.4.2.2.7. Confirm the fix worked by validating that the fix to the root cause
        actually prevents the symptoms from recurring.

            4.4.2.2.7.1. Validation may take the form of follow-up assessments to
            specifically look for that discrepancy. Validation may take the form of an
            external SAV. NOTE: AU organizations will not request AETC Functional
            SAVs within 1 year of a scheduled HHQ inspection. However, AU
            organizations may request SAVs from organizations within AU during that
            period.

            4.4.2.2.7.2. If the fix did not work, then the root cause identified is suspect
            and the OPR may have to re-engage the 8-step process to identify a more
            likely candidate as the root cause.

        4.4.2.2.8. The final action is to institutionalize the validated fix to the root cause.

     4.4.2.3. SAPMs will track the assigned OPRs progress in correcting the discrepancy.

        4.4.2.3.1. SAPMs will update the Commander on the status of discrepancies
        being tracked/corrected/closed at his level at the following minimum intervals:

            4.4.2.3.1.1. Squadron Level: Quarterly Review.

            4.4.2.3.1.2. Group Level: Semi-annual Review.

            4.4.2.3.1.3. Center or Equivalent Level: Semi-Annual Review.
AUI90-201 12 NOVEMBER 2013                                                               13

              4.4.2.3.2. Once the commander has been updated that a discrepancy has been
              closed, there is no requirement to continue to update the commander on that
              discrepancy on subsequent updates.

5. Documentation. This program requires units to maintain all SAP related documents for the
latest assessment (Attachment 2).

   5.1. SAPMs will maintain records IAW AFRIMs tables and rules. To the maximum extent
   possible, maintain the records electronically IAW AFMAN 33-363.

   5.2. Appointment letters and training letters

       5.2.1. Do not require “wet” signatures (See Attachment 3).

       5.2.2. Maintain current letters to document compliance.

   5.3. Maintain unit developed SACs in the Unit Developed SACs folder. Also maintain
   MAJCOM or Higher SACs that the unit has modified to meet unique unit requirements in
   this folder. MAJCOM or Higher SACs that have not been modified to meet unit
   requirements should not be filed in this folder. AETC maintains MAJCOM checklists on the
   AETC IG SharePoint.

   5.4. Completed checklists constitute Air Force Records and will be maintained IAW AFM
   33-363:

       5.4.1. Use appropriate electronic document naming conventions that are readily
       understandable so that employees, their colleagues, and/or successors can find and use
       information within MICT. The SAC abbreviation on the MICT checklist will utilize the
       primary governing directive as the abbreviation at HAF, MAJCOM and Center levels for
       both functionally-aligned and directive-driven SACs.

       5.4.2. The Subordinate Unit SAPM will maintain all SACs completed within the
       subordinate unit.

       5.4.3. The Center SAPMs will maintain all completed SACs that were completed at the
       Center level.

   5.5. The SAPM will ensure SAP follow-up files are maintained for the entire period between
   assessments in the unit’s SAP ERM folders (Attachment 2).

       5.5.1. All open SAP discrepancies will be maintained in the Open Discrepancies folder
       until they either closed or transferred to the next higher SAP Manager.

       5.5.2. Once closed, the SAP discrepancies will be maintained in the Closed
       Discrepancies folder.

       5.5.3. SAPMs will maintain an electronic record of the commander’s decision of which
       discrepancies the commander elected to retain at his level and which discrepancies he
14                                                           AUI90-201 12 NOVEMBER 2013

        decided to elevate the next higher echelon. This record may be a Memo For Record
        (MFR) or may be contained with the SAPMs discrepancy tracking mechanism.

            5.5.3.1. Maintain SAP discrepancies that are transferred to the next higher echelon in
            the Discrepancies Elevated to Center folder (for Subordinate Unit SAPs) or the
            Discrepancies Elevated to AU (for Center SAPs) folder.

        5.5.4. SAPMs will maintain an electronic record of updating the commander on the
        status of write-ups throughout the period required to close the finding. This record may
        take any of several forms based on the guidance from the commander. This record may
        be an e-mail, MFR, or contained within the SAPMs discrepancy tracking mechanism.

            5.5.4.1. If this review is documented in an e-mail or MFR, then file that document in
            the Commander’s Periodic Review of SAP folder. The MFR does not require a “wet”
            signature.

     5.6. The ERM file structure for the AU SAP is detailed in Attachment 2.

6. AF Special Interest Items (SII), AETC Command Interest Items (CII) and Command
Emphasis Areas (CEA).

     6.1. Special Interest Items (SII) are areas of focus for management; used to gather data and
     assess the status of specific programs and conditions in the field requiring AF senior leader
     attention. SIIs are managed at the SAF/IGI level.

     6.2. CII and CEA are areas of focus for MAJCOM leadership; used for essentially the same
     purposes as the AF SIIs.

     6.3. The AETC IG inspects all applicable active interest/emphasis items during CIs.

     6.4. AU/IG will notify Center Commanders and Center SAPMs upon receipt of an AF SII or
     an AETC CII or CEA.

        6.4.1. If appropriate, Center Commanders will appoint an OPR who is the unit’s expert
        who is well versed in the interest item area and who is responsible for ensuring the unit
        complies with the interest item. The interest item OPR is responsible for ensuring that the
        interest item area is prepared for inspection.

        6.4.2. If directed, the Center SAPM will coordinate with the interest/emphasis item OPR
        to conduct a self-assessment over the interest/emphasis item area using the inspection
        guide that is published with the interest/emphasis item.

        6.4.3. Center interest/emphasis item OPRs will forward the results of their assessment
        through the Center SAPM and Center Commander to AU/IG.

     6.5. AU/IG will consolidate interest/emphasis item inspection results from the Centers and
     forward through AU/CC to AETC/IG as directed and/or required.
AUI90-201 12 NOVEMBER 2013                                                            15

  6.6. Interest Item (SII, CII, or CEA) inspections are not required if AU will receive an
  AETC/IG inspection during the active interest item period.

  6.7. AU/IG and Center SAPMs will maintain interest item records IAW Attachment 2.

focus for management; used to gather data and assess the status of specific programs and
conditions in the field.

Critical Deficiency— Any deficiency that results or could result in widespread mission impact
or failure.

Discrepancy— An item within a self-assessment checklist that the inspector determines that the
unit is in non-compliance with the requirement.

Immediately Subordinate Unit— Those units that report directly to a given level of command.
For example, within the Spaatz Center, the immediately subordinate units are AWC, ACSC,
SOC, IOS, and the ESS. One of those units, SOC, also has immediately subordinate units – SOS

Minor Deficiency — Any deficiency that is procedurally incorrect but has only modest mission
impact.

Recommended Improvement Area (RIA) — An area that an inspector determines actually
meets the required guidelines but that could be done more effectively or efficiently by
implementing a suggested course of action.

Repeat findings—Findings that were identified in a prior inspection. This term includes those
findings that had previously been closed as well as those findings that were still open from a
prior inspection.

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) — The process contained within the AF 8-Step Problem Solving
Process used to determine the root cause of why a discrepancy occurred (reproduced in AUI 90-
201, Attachment 7). Used to identify a discrepancy code from AFI 90-201, Attachment 7.

Self-Assessment Program Manager (SAPM) — An individual, appointed by the unit
commander, responsible for managing the Self-Assessment Program within that unit. Both
Center Commanders and Subordinate Unit Commanders appoint primary and alternate SAPMs.

function accomplish its tasks more effectively or efficiently. SAVs may be executed by HHQ,
AU HQ, Centers, or program managers for Air University wide functions such as the Voting
Assistance Program or the Base Records Management Program.

Structured Problem Solving—A methodical process that includes clear identification of the
problem (vice just its symptoms), breaking the problem into its most fundamental parts,
establishing desired end states, determining root causes for the problem, developing solutions to
the root causes, implementing those solutions, validating that those solutions actually preclude
the problem from recurring, and culminating in standardizing (or institutionalizing) the solution.

Subordinate Unit Commander—A commander or director of a unit subordinate to a Center (or
Equivalent) or of a unit subordinate to another subordinate unit. This term refers to units such as
the 42 Mission Support Group as a subordinate of the 42 ABW, the 42 SF Squadron as a
subordinate to the 42 MSG, to the Air War College as a subordinate of the Spaatz Center, and to
a Directorate within the AU/HQ.

     on the uniformity and accuracy of the FCP (if maintaining the

     and initials of the Commander or First Sergeant in the top
     margin of the form?
      11 of 15 records reviewed had no initials indicating review in the past 10 months
NOTES:
1. This is an example of a checklist in which the inspector handwrote his or her comments. If the
checklist is not in MICT, then scan such a checklist as a PDF for electronic filing. Once filed
electronically, there is no requirement to physically maintain the hardcopy checklist.

2. The obvious shortcoming of this approach is that the checklist does not have much space for
the inspector to handwrite comments.

3. Since the checklists are in word tables, the inspector can create room in each inspected item by
adding blank lines to create the space to hand write comments and then print the document for
use during the inspection.

  5        leader’s CPR training had expired. However, the PT
           leader was able to produce a current CPR Training
           Certificate.
         Recommended Improvement Area – UFPM should
           establish a method to ensure required documentation
           is updated when appropriate. (Cross check Para
           1.15.2)

Corrective actions (1 Jun 13):
    1. PTL scheduled for refresher training by 15 Jun 13
Recommendation: Close
SIPM Review: Non-concur with close recommendation. PTL completing the refresher training
corrects the symptom, but does not address the root cause. Further root cause analysis needed.
Commander Review/Decision: Keep discrepancy open.
Further Analysis:
     8 Step Root Cause Analysis
            1. No accountability requiring individuals to meet PTL responsibilities
            2. No standard process to track/train/follow-up on PTL responsibilities
     Corrective actions (1 Jul 13):
            1. Develop a system to track currency of all PTL requirements by 1 Aug 13
            2. Establish a check list for all PTL’s identifying critical responsibilities as outlined
               in the AFI to be implemented by 1 Aug 13
Recommendation: Develop action plans to resolve root causes. Open
SIPM Review: Concur with open recommendation.
Commander Review/Decision: Keep discrepancy open.
Action Plans:
            1. Develop a system to track currency of all PTL requirements by 1 Aug 09
            2. Establish a check list for all PTL’s identifying critical responsibilities as outlined
               in the AFI to be implemented by 1 Aug 09
Recommendation: Close
SIPM Review: Non-Concur with close recommendation. Actions to be completed in the future
are inappropriate justification to close discrepancy.
Commander Review/Decision: Keep discrepancy open.
Corrective actions (1 Sep 09):
     1. PTL requirement tracking system is in place and UFPM trained in its use.

Notes:

1. SAPMs will assign a unique number to each discrepancy to assist in tracking the discrepancy
and its associated corrective actions.
2. OPR will append successive Corrective Actions to existing document.
3. SAPM will maintain this document trail from its inception until the next HHQ inspection, but
does not need to maintain each iteration as an independent file. In the example above, the trail
would have been “saved” at the following points:
     When the SAPM tasked the discrepancy to the OPR.
     After the Commander’s decision on the first corrective action.
     After the Commander’s decision on the second corrective action
     After the Commander’s decision to close.
4. Since each of the preceding documents is contained within its successor, there is no
requirement to continue to maintain the preceding document. After the CC’s decision to close
the discrepancy, then the SAPM would move this document from the Open Discrepancy ERM
folder to the Closed Discrepancy ERM folder. The document will be maintained in the Closed
Discrepancy ERM folder until the next HHQ inspection.

    THE AIR FORCE 8-STEP PROBLEM SOLVING PROCESS, ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
                           AND DEFICIENCY CODES

    A7.1. From AFI 90-201, paragraph 5.4.5.10.2, Units will use HAF inspection checklists, once
    established, and deficiency codes listed in Attachment 7 to conduct self-inspections. Unit, NAF,
    or MAJCOM supplemental checklists may be developed, as appropriate. Basic responsibility for
    problem solving and the corrective action process resides at the lowest appropriate command
    level. Problem solving should be applied through the AF 8-Step problem solving model as
    outlined in the Air Force Smart Operations for the 21st Century (AFSO21) Playbook (or
    SAF/USMS approved publication) leading to identification of root causes and solutions to
    deficiencies
