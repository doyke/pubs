SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include: This change in policy reflects current policy found in Air Force Instruction 35-105,
Community Relations, 26 January 2010, Change 1, 31 August 2011, paragraphs 45.1 – 45.3.8.


1. POLICY. The Honorary Commanders (H/CC) Program is a public relations tool whereby
local civic and community leaders gain insight and experience about Air Force and Little Rock
Air Force Base (LRAFB) operations and programs by working with Air Force commanders and
personnel. Air Force commanders and personnel likewise benefit through increased association
 2                                          LITTLEROCKAFBI35-104 18 SEPTEMBER 2012


with the community and its key leaders. Public Affairs will provide the wing commander all
appropriate guidance and background work and will assist participating commanders and civic
leaders as necessary and appropriate to ensure the program's overall success.
2. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS. The H/CC Program objectives are to increase public
awareness and understanding of the Air Force mission, policies and programs and to maintain a
reputation as a good neighbor.
     2.1. Participation. The H/CC Program involves LRAFB commanders, the staff agency
     chiefs, Director of Staff, Wing Chaplain, Comptroller Squadron Commander, Wing Staff
     Judge Advocate, tenant unit commanders, command chiefs, participating civilian H/CCs,
     Public Affairs, Security Forces and Protocol. The success of the H/CC Program relies on
     each participant's involvement in the program.
     2.2. Just Cause. The 19th Airlift Wing Commander has authority to remove an H/CC if
     their conduct or actions bring discredit to themselves, their community, or the US Air Force.
     2.3. Honorary Commanders DV Status. For newly appointed H/CC, their Distinguished
     Visitor (DV) status allowing their unescorted base entry authorization and use of base
     facilities is valid for the duration of their active status as an H/CC between the hours of 0600
     to 2200. They are still required to have an authorized escort between the hours of 2200 and
     0600. The 19th Security Forces Squadron will issue the newly appointed H/CCs and all
     current H/CC Emeritus’ a Defense Biometrics Identification System (DBIDS) card in
     accordance with 19th Security Forces Squadron guidance and operating instructions. Once an
     H/CC has served his/her term, then their status becomes H/CC Emeritus. The status on the
     DBIDS card must be modified to reflect this change. Both active and emeritus H/CC are
     required to comply with the annual background check as explained in this operating
     instruction’s paragraphs 3.3.2. and 3.4. respectively.
        2.3.1. The 19th Airlift Wing commander has the authority and right to revoke any active
        or emeritus H/CC’s DV status should circumstances warrant it.
     2.4. Nomination Process. The intent of an H/CC program is to educate those with limited
     knowledge about the Air Force and the installation. Civilian nominees will be selected
     among elected officials, mayors, chamber of commerce members, principals of local schools,
     Military Affairs Committee members and others who, because of their position or influence
     in the community, have a positive impact on the public support for the base.
     Recommendations for H/CCs from military commanders and individuals outside the wing
     will be collected and maintained by public affairs, and nominees will be selected by wing
     leadership. The final approval authority is the Wing Commander. (See Attachment 2 of 3 to
     this LRAFB Instruction.)
        2.4.1. Nominees should not be an immediate relative (spouse, child, parent, sibling) of a
        current or former H/CC.
        2.4.2. Nominees should not be military retirees, current Reserve or Guard personnel
        because the program aims at orienting community members with limited knowledge of
        today’s military.
        2.4.3. No more than one nominee from any individual organization should serve as an
        H/CC in any given year with the exception of the various Chambers of Commerce or
LITTLEROCKAFBI35-104 18 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                         3


     Military Affairs Committees. Examples of organizations that should only have one
     representative to the program include individual schools or businesses.
     2.4.4. Nominees can work in a media-related field, but cannot be a print, TV, or radio
     reporter due to conflict of interest allowing reporters unescorted access to the base and
     base leadership.
     2.4.5. Nominees will not be members of Congress or their staff.
     2.4.6. Nominees will not be major contractors, nor anyone else who may give the
     perception of conflict of interest.
     2.4.7. Nominees will not include any federally elected or appointed officials. Nominees
     should not include anyone whose membership would cast a negative light on the U.S. Air
     Force.
     2.4.8. Term limits should be no more than three years to enhance the program’s reach
     and effectiveness, avoid program stagnation, and avoid the perception of cronyism. If
     requested, a current H/CC may terminate their term early. Should an H/CC not fulfill
     their responsibilities, the installation commander may terminate their term early.
  2.5. Selection Process. Public Affairs will create a list of proposed H/CCs, based on
  guidelines listed in paragraphs 2.4.-2.4.8 and from military commanders recommendations
  submitted for review.
  2.6. Notification Process. Upon 19th Airlift Wing Commander’s approval, Public Affairs
  will draft and prepare appropriate letters (electronic) of invitation for selected individuals.
  The H/CC will be invited to attend an induction ceremony in their honor. A project officer
  will be assigned and, with assistance from Public Affairs and Protocol, will ensure the event
  is professional and upholds Air Force tradition.
  2.7. Annual Events. During the calendar year, several events will take place on base to
  bring the H/CC together with their host military commanders.
     2.7.1. Change of Command/Induction Ceremony. This event will be conducted in the
     normal Change of Command/Induction Ceremony sequence presenting each H/CC with
     an H/CC's Certificate. Each military commander is invited to make a unit presentation of
     the certificate. At the time of presentation, a photo will be taken with the unit
     commander and her/his H/CC. A reception will follow the ceremony and spouses and
     guests may be invited to attend. Visual Information will document the event and the
     photos will be made available on Flickr or another accessible site for H/CCs to print at
     their own expense. Also, military commanders should display their H/CC’s photo in an
     appropriate site within the unit. As soon as possible after the ceremony, participating
     military commanders should take their H/CC for a short tour of their unit and introduce
     her/him to all available unit personnel. If the newly appointed H/CC can’t attend this
     base event, the military commander should invite the H/CC to attend a unit event and
     present the certificate and oath at that time.
     2.7.2. Annual Orientation Flight. Public Affairs will coordinate with various
     commanders and sections for an annual orientation flight through the proper approval
     authority. However, the 19th Airlift Wing Commander will serve as the final approval
     for the date of an H/CC Program orientation flight.
 4                                         LITTLEROCKAFBI35-104 18 SEPTEMBER 2012


        2.7.3. LRAFB Tours. All H/CCs should be invited to tour a portion of LRAFB on a
        rotational basis. The 19th Airlift Wing, 314th Airlift Wing, 189th Airlift Wing, 22nd Air
        Force, Detachment 1 should sponsor one H/CC tour of their wing per year. A project
        officer from each wing or detachment will be responsible for coordinating, with the
        assistance of public affairs community relations, the tour.
        2.7.4. Boot Camp. All H/CCs should be invited to participate in a Team Little Rock
        Boot Camp. Public Affairs will assist base-appointed project officers in organizing a Air
        Force-type basic military training day for the H/CCs. This camp should include previous
        Training Instructors (TI), who have been authorized to wear the TI’s ―Smokey‖ hat, as
        the groups’ drill sergeant for the day – with marching, facing movements, reporting
        statements and other military edicate. This event should provide the H/CCs with a
        realistic view of what it’s like to be a fresh recruit in BMT at Lackland AFB.
3. RESPONSIBILITY. The Community Relations Office will help ensure compliance with
this LRAFB instruction, reporting directly to the Chief of Public Affairs to advise the wing
commander on program success or problems encountered in its implementation.
     3.1. Wing Commander Responsibilities. Exercise overall oversight for the H/CC Program
     and officiate the H/CC Change of Command/Induction Ceremonies. Invite H/CC to wing
     functions (e.g. base open house, military ceremonies, etc.). Participate in H/CC quarterly
     events when available and sponsor a tour of their wing or detachment.
     3.2. Military Commanders Responsibilities. Invite respective H/CC to all unit functions
     whenever possible to ensure the H/CC is a welcome and active partner in the unit. Ensure
     that members under your command are active and positive ambassadors for the Air Force,
     LRAFB, and your unit. Provide your H/CC a tour of your unit. Participate in quarterly
     H/CC events. Each military commander participating in the program will invite her/his
     H/CC to at least one event per quarter. Each military commander participating in the
     program must invite the current and H/CC Emeritus members to unit events when practical.
     Notify Public Affairs immediately of any problems with the program (e.g., lack of H/CC
     participation, conflicts, etc.). Provide quarterly feedback to Public Affairs on how the
     program is working and provide ideas on ways to improve the program. (See Attachment 2
     of 2 to this LRAFB Instruction.)
     3.3. Honorary Commander Responsibilities. Serve as a unit H/CC for no more than three
     years. Whenever possible, attend unit functions to which they are invited. Be a proactive
     supporter of the unit for which she/he is the H/CC and thus representing the base community.
     Interact with unit personnel to learn more about the missions of their unit, the base, and the
     Air Force. Invite their host squadron members to tour and participate in activities at their
     work center at least once quarterly.
        3.3.1. At the end of their tenure, H/CCs will automatically transfer to H/CC Emeritus
        status.
        3.3.2. In order to become an H/CC each civic leader must agree to an annual background
        check. They must provide the following information: Full legal name, EXACTLY as it
        appears on their state-issued drivers’ license, date of birth (day/month/year); and the
        complete driver’s license number including the issuing state. Public Affairs will gather
        this information and forward it to the 19th Security Forces Squadron to conduct a
LITTLEROCKAFBI35-104 18 SEPTEMBER 2012                                                         5


     background check. Refusal to offer this information will result in the member’s removal
     from the program.
  3.4. Honorary Commander Emeritus Responsibilities. The 19th Airlift Wing encourages
  those in emeritus status to continue to interact with the unit she/he served as an H/CC, act as
  an advisor to the incoming unit H/CC, and serve as a vital link between the military and
  community leaders. In order to maintain their status as an H/CC Emeritus, each must agree
  to an annual background check. They must provide the following information: Full legal
  name, EXACTLY as it appears on their state-issued drivers’ license, date of birth
  (day/month/year); and the complete driver’s license number including the issuing state.
  Public Affairs will request this information once (with a suspense). Once the information is
  gathered it will be forwarded to the 19th Security Forces Squadron to conduct a background
  check. Refusal to offer this information or to meet the suspense is grounds for the member’s
  removal from the program.
  3.5. Protocol Office Responsibilities. Protocol will ensure H/CCs are invited to key wing
  events (e.g., changes of command, retirements, open houses, holiday parties, etc.). Protocol,
  in conjunction with Public Affairs and the appointed project officers, is responsible for
  arranging the H/CC change-of-command and/or induction ceremonies.
  3.6. Public Affairs Office Responsibilities. Public Affairs has overall responsibility for
  managing the H/CC Program. Public Affairs will review the program annually to
  recommend and execute changes to the program with the 19th Airlift Wing Commander’s
  approval. Public Affairs will request the appointment of a wing project officer through the 19
  AW/CCE or 19 AW/DS for each H/CC Program event (e.g. quarterly tours, annual
  orientation flights, bi-annual change-of-command/induction ceremonies, etc.).
     3.6.1. The Community Relations staff will take recommendations from military
     commanders, the Base Community Council Executive Board and based on that input and
     their experience, they will make recommendations for new and replacement H/CCs to the
     19th Airlift Wing Commander as necessary. The Community Relations staff will assist
     appointed project officers in arranging annual orientation flights and wing-specific tours
     for H/CC.
     3.6.2. The Community Relations staff will monitor interaction between military
     commandrs and the H/CCs. If no interaction is apparent, the Community Relations staff
     will contact both parties to encourage more cooperation. If necessary, the H/CC may be
     contacted to see if she/he would like to withdraw from the program.
     3.6.3. Ensure incoming H/CC are briefed on the program, provided the contact
     information of their assigned military commander and arrange initial contact between
     them at the induction ceremony.
     3.6.4. Provide each H/CC an information package containing fact sheets, and base
     economic impact analysis.
     3.6.5. Produce appropriate internal coverage of the program and add H/CCs to the
     Combat Airlifter distribution list and encourage them to join the base on Facebook.

    3.7. Security Forces Squadron Responsibilities: The 19th Security Forces Squadron will
    perform annual background checks on all active and emeritus H/CCs based on the
    information collected and provided by Public Affairs. 19th SFS will also ensure Security

FEEDBACK ON THE HONORARY COMMANDER PROGRAM:
(e.g., we've developed great partnership, constantly invited to their off-base events, introduced our families to each
other, toured her/his work site--amazed by dynamics of their business, etc.) or (e.g., evident personality clash, HC
doesn't respond to invitations, no interaction-recommend Public Affairs contact HC, etc.)
