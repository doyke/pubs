SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This interim change revises AFI 91-104 by formalizing that MAJCOMs are not required to
supplement AFI 91-104 to list no-lone zones. MAJCOMs are only required to clearly mark all
no-lone zones and indicate at all entry control points that two-person concept applies. A margin
bar (I) indicates newly revised material.
1. Requirements and Procedures.
     1.1. Tamper Control Program. The Two-Person Concept (TPC) is central to nuclear surety
     tamper control measures in the Air Force. It is designed to make sure that a lone individual
     cannot perform an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure on a nuclear weapon, nuclear
     weapon system, or certified critical component.
     1.2. Concept Enforcement. Each organization with a mission or function involving nuclear
     weapons, nuclear weapon systems, or certified critical components:
        1.2.1. Clearly mark all no-lone zones. Indicate at all entry control points that two-person
        concept applies. (T-1)
        1.2.2. Enforces the Two-Person Concept. (T-1)
        1.2.3. Develops procedures to limit entry to authorized persons who meet the
        requirements of paragraph 1.3. (T-1)
     1.3. Team Requirements. (Refer to paragraph 1.6.1 for criteria on foreign nationals.) A Two-
     Person Concept team consists of at least two individuals who: (T-0).
        1.3.1. Are certified under the Personnel Reliability Program (PRP), as specified in DoD
        5210.42-R_AFMAN 10-3902, Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program.
        1.3.2. Know the nuclear surety requirements of the task they perform.
        1.3.3. Can promptly detect an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure.
        1.3.4. Have successfully completed nuclear surety training according to AFI 91-101, Air
        Force Nuclear Weapons Surety Program.
        1.3.5. Are designated to perform the required task.
     1.4. Two Person Concept Violations. Report a Two-Person Concept violation when a lone
     individual in a no-lone zone has the opportunity to tamper with or damage a nuclear weapon,
     nuclear weapon system, or certified critical component. Refer to AFMAN 91- 221, Weapons
     Safety Investigations and Reports, for reporting guidance. (T-0).
Note: If TPC is maintained by more than two persons, a lone individual maybe temporarily
obscured from sight or not directly observed by the remaining TPC team if the lone individual is
in a location that would preclude the ability to perform an incorrect act or unauthorized
procedure that could affect the nuclear weapons, the weapon system, or critical components (i.e.
AFI91-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                                         3


There is no violation of the two-person concept). However, the TPC team must maintain
awareness of the location and justification for the lone individual to be temporarily out of sight
(e.g., an individual whether on PRP or non-PRP under escort, may enter a lavatory or other
sealed compartment within a no-lone zone without continuous direct observation by the
remaining TPC team as long as that compartment does not afford access as previously described).

A momentary breach of the no-lone zone is not a violation if no individual had the opportunity to
perform an incorrect act or unauthorized procedure. In performing certain tasks, team members
may lose sight of each other or be far apart. One team member may be briefly out of sight to
perform a specific task if it is unsafe or physically impossible to maintain constant observation.
   1.5. Authorized Deviations. You may deviate from the Two-Person Concept when: (T-0).
       1.5.1. The nuclear Weapon System Safety Rules (WSSR) specifically authorize a
       deviation.
       1.5.2. An emergency presents an immediate threat to the safety of personnel or the
       security of a nuclear weapon, nuclear weapon system, or certified critical component.
       War plan exercises are not considered emergencies.
   1.6. Additional Conditions: (T-0).
       1.6.1. Non-US Personnel. Per AFI 91-112, Safety Rules For US/NATO Strike Fighters,
       for US custodial units at allied installations, foreign nationals may be part of a Two-
       Person Concept, and host nations will implement equivalent personnel reliability
       programs.
       1.6.2. Entry Control Personnel. The Two-Person Concept applies to individuals who
       control entry into a no-lone zone. Entry controllers may not form a Two-Person Concept
       team with personnel inside the no-lone zone.
       1.6.3. Couriers. Couriers ensure that the host installation meets Two-Person Concept
       requirements and no-lone zones are delineated around nuclear logistics aircraft.
       1.6.4. PRP Interim-Certified Personnel Restrictions. Two interim-certified individuals
       may not form a Two-Person Concept team. Also, an interim-certified member may not
       pilot a single-seat aircraft loaded with nuclear weapons.
       1.6.5. Nonqualified Personnel. An individual who does not qualify as a member of a
       Two-Person Concept team may enter a no-lone zone to perform a specific task only if
       escorted by a Two-Person Concept team. Escorts should be capable of detecting incorrect
       acts or unauthorized procedures. Escort procedures will be accomplished in accordance
       with the applicable directive(s) governing the nuclear weapon system or critical
       component defining the no-lone zone.
       1.6.6. Sigma 14. Personnel granted Department of Energy (DOE) Sigma 14 access are
       prohibited from being part of a two-person concept team that may afford access to a
       nuclear weapon. For additional information on DOE Sigma categories and requirements,
       see DoDD 3150.02, DoD Nuclear Weapons Surety Program.
2. Tamper Detection Program.
   2.1. Sealing Requirements. Certain items must be sealed because either: (T-0).
 4                                                                      AFI91-104 23 APRIL 2013


        2.1.1. Air Force nuclear WSSRs require it, or,
        2.1.2. In the case of some certified critical components, seals protect their certification
        status while in storage or during transportation, as specified in AFI 91-105, Critical
        Components
     2.2. Sealing Methods. Authorized sealing methods include: (T-0).
        2.2.1. Safety Wiring and Sealing. Two types of seals are authorized using this method.
        The first method consists of seals composed of a malleable material installed with a
        crimping device and controlled die to form an impressed distinctive mark or unique
        identifier. The second method consists of seals applied with self-locking, non-reversible
        feature with a singularly unique serial number/alpha, color control system. Both types of
        seals are used with safety wire connected to certain switches, covers, handles, or levers.
        Breakage or alteration of the wire or seal provides evidence/detection of possible
        unauthorized acts, access or tampering. Use this method only in no-lone zones.
        2.2.2. Tamper Detection Indicators (TDI). In this method, an approved TDI is placed so
        it will indicate if someone has activated, or had access to the interior of a certified critical
        component. Once the TDI is installed, evidence of tampering is visible to the naked eye
        or can be detected using special equipment.
            2.2.2.1. TDI and other authorized sealing methods proposed for use in nuclear
            weapons systems will be properly certified prior to use according to AFI 63-125,
            Nuclear Certification Program.
3. Responsibilities.
     3.1. Air Force Chief of Safety (AF/SE) oversees the Air Force Nuclear Surety Tamper
     Control and Detection Programs. Acting for AF/SE, the Chief of the Weapons Safety
     Division manages the programs and certifies the design safety features of sealing methods
     proposed for use in nuclear weapon systems according to AFI 91-103, Air Force Nuclear
     Safety Design Certification Program.
     3.2. Nuclear Weapon System Safety Group (NWSSG) recommends sealing requirements in
     operational nuclear weapon systems and proposes specific nuclear weapon system safety
     rules, if necessary. (See AFI 91-102, Nuclear Weapon System Safety Studies, Operational
     Safety Reviews, and Safety Rules.)
     3.3. Major Commands:
        3.3.1. Develop and publish Field publications, as needed, to implement and enforce the
        Air Force Nuclear Surety Tamper Control and Detection Programs throughout their
        commands.
        3.3.2. Develop and distribute procedures for sealing, where appropriate. At a minimum,
        the procedural publication will:
            3.3.2.1. State when and by whom seals can be applied and removed.
            3.3.2.2. Establish controls for the handling, receipt, storage, issue, inventory, and
            disposal of TDIs (including all residue), controlled dies and self-locking, non-
            reversible seals (example: roto-seals).
AFI91-104 23 APRIL 2013                                                                       5


         3.3.2.3. Direct that TDIs, controlled dies and self-locking, non-reversible seals are
         stored and accounted for by individuals not responsible for their installation.
         3.3.2.4. Direct personnel to comply with the following steps for malleable seals only:
            3.3.2.4.1. Place a distinctive marking (determined locally) on malleable seals
            using a crimping device and die.
            3.3.2.4.2. Be sure to destroy any distinctive markings on malleable seals after you
            remove them.
         3.3.2.5. Direct personnel to verify seal integrity immediately following installation.
         Note: For aircraft only, verify seals before and after any task or operation performed
         in the immediate area of the seal. Do not verify aircraft seals before an operation or
         task during alert crew member exercises or actual responses, but do verify the seals
         after the exercise or alert.
         3.3.2.6. Require periodic inspections of seals on nuclear weapon-loaded aircraft,
         missile systems, and certified critical components in storage or transport.
         3.3.2.7. Require that only Two-Person Concept teams install seals and verify they
         remain intact.
         3.3.2.8. Direct training of maintenance personnel, aircrews, missile combat crews,
         and other involved personnel to recognize distinctive marking or serial numbers of
         the seals.
         3.3.2.9. Prescribe a course of action when an installed seal is found broken or shows
         evidence of tampering. At a minimum:
            3.3.2.9.1. Investigate the event and send a mishap report according to AFMAN
            91-221, Weapons Safety Investigations and Reports.
            3.3.2.9.2. Establish procedures to maintain control of the system until situation is
            resolved.
            3.3.2.9.3. Check the integrity of the weapon system and reseal if integrity is
            assured.
            3.3.2.9.4. Prescribe a course of action when a seal is accidentally broken during
            authorized operations.
            3.3.2.9.5. Ensure training seals can be easily distinguished from, and are not used
            as, operational seals.
  3.4. Two-Person Concept Team Responsibilities: (T-0).
     3.4.1. Enforce the Two-Person Concept while performing a task or operation and
     continue to enforce it until you are either relieved by authorized personnel or you have
     secured the nuclear weapon, nuclear weapon system, or certified critical component.
     3.4.2. Take immediate, positive steps to prevent or stop an incorrect procedure or
     unauthorized act.
     3.4.3. Report deviations immediately to the appropriate supervisor.
