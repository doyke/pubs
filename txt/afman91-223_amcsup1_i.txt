                                       GENERAL INFORMATION

1.1. Overview. This manual provides aviation unique guidance to support AFI 91-204, Safety Investiga-
tion and Reports. It directs procedures specific to investigating and reporting USAF aviation mishaps and
events.

1.2. Non-reportable mishaps. Do not report Aviation Mishaps meeting Class D dollar cost or injury cri-
teria as defined in AFI 91-204, paragraph 1.8.4.

1.3. Aviation Events that Require Safety Investigations and Reports.
1.3. (AMC) Aviation Events that Require Safety Investigations and Reports. Aircrew will use the
AMC Form 97, AMC In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet, in lieu of the AF
Form 711 for initial mishap reporting. Safety offices must supply an abundant quantity of these forms in
all aircrew trip kits and in all common-use areas such as Base Operations and squadron flight planning
rooms. This form is intended to communicate the facts about the incident. Information entered on this
form will not be protected under the privileged guidelines in AFI 91-204, Chapter 3. Once this form is
filled out, units must ensure that there is a process in place to transmit this form to the unit safety office in
the most expeditious manner possible.
    1.3.1. Class E Events. Events that do not meet reportable mishap classification criteria described in
    AFI 91-204, paragraph 1.8. and have a high potential for causing injury, occupational illness, or dam-
    age if they recur (high potential for becoming a mishap). Class E events are deemed important to
    investigate and trend for mishap prevention. Unless noted, report all events whether intent for flight is
    established or not. In most cases, events do not require reporting if they occur as described in the air-
    craft flight manuals and are expected responses to crew’s actions or flight regime. For example, do not
    report the loss of pitot-static instrument indications if the loss is the result of crew failure to activate
    the pitot heat. If the circumstances of an event meet two or more criteria, such as an in-flight fire
    which results in a physiological episode, report the event utilizing the following hierarchy: Physiolog-
    ical, Propulsion, Flight Control, Instrument, Miscellaneous, High Accident Potential (HAP). Hazard-
    ous Air Traffic Report (HATR), Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Violation, Bird/Wildlife Aircraft
    Strike Hazard (BASH).
    1.3.1. (AMC) Safety of flight and near mishap events which involve maintenance and pre-flight error
    or previously known deficiencies within specific aircraft systems highlight a need for additional pro-
    cedures to investigate close calls that normally would not be reported. For example, (1) an improperly
    installed aileron control rod which resulted in un-commanded aircraft rolling. (2) A thrust reverser
    hydraulic hose failure, which resulted in aircrew landing at nearest airfield. A near mishap, close call
    or a failure trend is evidence enough to recommend a safety investigation. A major benefit is a higher
    level of review for troublesome trends, before high dollar or injury/death mishaps occur. The safety
    investigation process and impoundment investigation process now becomes proactive instead of reac-
    tive.
        1.3.1.1. Physiological Events. Report episodes of abnormal physical, mental, or behavioral condi-
        tions or symptoms which occur during or after flight. For assistance in determining reportability of
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                   5


     physiological events, contact the owning MAJCOM SEF, SGP, or HQ AFSC/SEFL, DSN
     246-0830/0880, commercial (505) 846-0830/0880. The following events must be reported:
        1.3.1.1.1. Aircrew or passenger decompression sickness from evolved gas (bends, chokes,
        skin, neurological, or neurocirculatory manifestations).
        1.3.1.1.2. Aircrew loss of consciousness or incapacitation in-flight.
        1.3.1.1.3. Aircrew hypoxic (altitude) hypoxia (suspected, probable, or definite).
        1.3.1.1.4. Aircrew trapped gas disorders (ear, sinus, teeth, or abdominal).
        1.3.1.1.5. Aircrew or passenger symptoms or health effects caused by toxic, noxious, or irri-
        tating materials such as smoke, fumes (including carbon monoxide) or liquids.
        1.3.1.1.6. Aircrew G-induced loss of consciousness.
        1.3.1.1.7. Aircrew spatial disorientation of any type (including visual illusion) resulting in an
        unusual aircraft attitude.
        1.3.1.1.8. Any medical condition, event or physical injury directly resulting from perfor-
        mance of flight activities that an aeromedical professional determines is significant to the
        health of the aircrew.
        1.3.1.1.9. Aircrew degraded operational capabilities or retinal damage caused by military or
        commercial lasers.
     1.3.1.2. Propulsion-Related Events. Report the following propulsion related events:
        1.3.1.2.1. Loss of thrust sufficient to prevent maintaining level flight at a safe altitude or
        which requires the pilot to jettison stores.
        1.3.1.2.2. Engines which do not restart normally after an intentional in-flight engine shut-
        down for training, functional check flight (FCF) or other non-emergency purposes. A normal
        restart is one that occurs at the planned and expected time and altitude using routine restart
        procedures.
        1.3.1.2.3. Emergency or precautionary landing of a single engine or rotary wing aircraft, with
        imminent engine or rotor drive system failure confirmed after landing.
        1.3.1.2.4. Any unselected or inadvertent propeller or thrust reversal event.
        1.3.1.2.5. Turbine engine flameout, failure, or emergency shutdown after completing normal
        engine start sequence until normal engine shutdown at mission conclusion. This applies to all
        single engine and multiple-engine aircraft. Do not report:
            1.3.1.2.5.1. Flameouts or emergency engine shutdowns occurring during maintenance
            engine runs
            1.3.1.2.5.2. Intentional inflight engine shutdowns for training or FCF.
            1.3.1.2.5.3. (Added-AMC) KC-135R and KC-10 units experiencing acoustical tile panel
            damage due to in-flight ice shedding will report the incident via the AMC Form 97, AMC
            In-Flight Emergency and Unusual Occurrence Worksheet. If the only action is to
            remove and replace the failed components, the incident will be treated as a failure of com-
            ponent parts due to normal wear and tear and does not require a formal investigation.

       1.3.1.2.6. All F-16 engine stalls, when operating outside of Region 1 (except F100-PW-200
       engine stalls). Do not report stalls occurring during maintenance engine runs.
       1.3.1.2.7. All F-15 engine stalls, occurring during afterburner operation that involves maneu-
       vering flight (except F100-PW-100 engine stalls). Do not report stalls occurring during main-
       tenance engine runs.
    1.3.1.3. Flight Control-Related Events.
       1.3.1.3.1. Unintentional departure from controlled flight for any reason.
       1.3.1.3.2. All uncommanded inputs to the flight controls (including stability augmenter, auto-
       pilot, or trim systems) whether it results in a dangerous situation or not. Report autopilot faults
       if, in the opinion of the investigator, the autopilot would have put the aircraft in a dangerous
       situation.
       1.3.1.3.3. All uncommanded reversions to a backup mode for any safety critical flight control
       system.
       1.3.1.3.4. Aircraft side stick controller interference from any source or for any reason.
    1.3.1.4. Instrument-Related Events.
       1.3.1.4.1. In-flight loss of all pitot-static instrument indications.
       1.3.1.4.2. In-flight loss of both primary and standby attitude indicators.
       1.3.1.4.3. Simultaneous loss of more than one electronic display (i.e.; Multi-function Display/
       CRT) showing attitude, altitude, airspeed or heading. Report regardless of duration of event or
       ability to fly the aircraft on standby instruments.

       1.3.1.5.4. Unintended departure from takeoff or landing surfaces, (e.g. runway, helipad, land-
       ing zone, etc.) onto adjacent surfaces. Includes landing short of the landing surface. For the
       purposes of this manual, the overrun is considered part of the takeoff or landing surface.
       1.3.1.5.5. Spillage or leakage of radioactive, toxic, corrosive, or flammable material from air-
       craft stores or cargo that creates a hazardous condition or an airborne emergency divert. Iden-
       tify in the message which agency or unit prepared the shipment. If cargo is shipped under a
       waiver, tell which agency (MAJCOM, Numbered Air Force, etc.) granted the waiver.
       1.3.1.5.6. Explosive/missile releases impacting outside of the impact area. If a malfunction of
       the explosive or missile is involved, report as explosive/missile mishap.
       1.3.1.5.7. Any unintentional strike by an aircraft or UAV to another object.
       1.3.1.5.8. All events where a member of the crew executed any portion of an emergency
       checklist in response to smoke or fumes. The intent is to report those noxious fumes and/or
       visible particulate matter that the crew has decided constituted a safety hazard versus an
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                    7


        annoying odor. If the event meets the reporting criteria in paragraph 1.3.1.1., report as a “Phys-
        iological Event.”
        1.3.1.5.9. In-flight malfunction of an air refueling drogue, hose, hose reel assembly, or refuel-
        ing pod.
        1.3.1.5.10. Structural failure of critical landing gear components. A critical landing gear com-
        ponent is defined as any component that could cause landing gear collapse upon failure.
        1.3.1.5.11. In-flight hoist malfunctions involving inadvertent separation of the hoist cable
        from the hoist (i.e., inadvertent cable shear or cable unwrapping from the drum).
     1.3.1.6. High Accident Potential (HAP) Events. Report any hazardous occurrence that has a high
     potential for becoming a mishap as a HAP event. This includes emergency conditions arising from
     aircraft operation or from the failure or malfunction of systems or components essential for safe
     flight.
     1.3.1.7. Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR) Events. Report any air traffic or movement area
     hazardous occurrence that endangers the safety of an aircraft or UAV. The intent of the HATR pro-
     gram is to identify potentially hazardous aviation practices or procedures based on a particular
     event and to disseminate information that might prevent similar hazardous conditions at other
     USAF locations or operations. See paragraph 6.2. for specific HATR reporting guidance. Report
     the following:
        1.3.1.7.1. Near Mid Air Collision (NMAC): Aircrew took abrupt evasive action to avoid a
        collision or would have taken evasive action if circumstances allowed.
        1.3.1.7.2. TCAS Resolution Advisories (RA): TCAS RAs (involving USAF aircraft/UAV)
        that require the aircraft/UAV to deviate from an assigned clearance. This includes USAF air-
        craft/UAV triggering TCAS RA aboard civil or other DOD aircraft.
        1.3.1.7.3. Air Traffic Control (ATC) Services: Any ATC service that contributed to a hazard-
        ous air traffic condition. Example: Failure by ATC to maintain required separation between
        aircraft under their control.
        1.3.1.7.4. Pilot Procedures: Any aircrew actions that contributed to a hazardous condition.
        1.3.1.7.5. Navigational Aid (NAVAID): An equipment indication/malfunction that contrib-
        uted to a hazardous air traffic condition.
        1.3.1.7.6. Flight Information Publication (FLIP)/ Notice to Airman (NOTAM): Any occur-
        rence with the FLIP/NOTAM publications that contributed to a hazardous condition
        1.3.1.7.7. Ground Events: Any occurrence caused by an aircraft, vehicle, or pedestrian in the
        movement area (e.g. taxiway/ramp/parking area) that endangers an airborne aircraft or an air-
        craft operation on the ground.
        1.3.1.7.8. Runway Intrusions: Unauthorized entry of a runway or other surface used for take-
        off and landing of aircraft that results in aircraft endangerment.
        1.3.1.7.9. Publications/Directives: Errors in air traffic publications/directives that contributed
        to a hazardous air traffic condition.
        1.3.1.7.10. Communications: Any communications, or lack thereof, that contributed to a haz-
        ardous air traffic condition.

       1.3.1.8. Controlled Movement Area (CMA) Violation Events. Reference AFI 91-204, Attachment
       1, for CMA definition. Report airfield infractions caused by aircraft, vehicles, or pedestrians
       entering the CMA without specific control tower approval. See paragraph 6.2. for specific CMA
       Violation event reporting guidance. If the violation resulted in the endangerment of an aircraft,
       report as a Class E HATR event.
       1.3.1.9. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Events. Bird/wildlife strikes (damaging and
       non-damaging) with less than Class C damage thresholds. Bird/wildlife strikes to captive or live
       munitions (explosive/missiles) are reported as aviation events. A message is not required for strike
       events if no other Class E criteria are met (ie. engine shutdown).
           1.3.1.9.1. Flight safety offices of the organization owning the aircraft will report bird/wildlife
           strikes. Strikes occurring to non-USAF DoD aircraft at AF bases are reported by the host
           installation flight safety office.
           1.3.1.9.2. Aircrews and maintenance personnel documenting the necessary data for reporting
           wildlife strikes through AFSAS can use AF Form 853, Air Force Bird/Wildlife Strike Report.
           1.3.1.9.3. Wildlife strike events occurring while aircraft are assigned to an expeditionary
           force will be reported by the expeditionary force flight safety office, when staffed adequately.

1.4. UAV Mishaps. If a UAV is destroyed and destruction was not a desired objective of the planned mis-
sion, it is considered a UAV mishap. If UAV destruction was a desired objective of the planned mission,
it is a mishap only if destruction occurs outside authorized range airspace and/or if collateral damage
results.
    1.4.1. Critical Profile Missions. An FSAT RPV or Sub-scale RPV mission may be declared a Critical
    Profile mission when planned mission requirements result in a high mishap risk.
    1.4.2. Critical Profile Mission Criteria.
       1.4.2.1. Designate RPV missions as Critical Profile missions when the following criteria are met
       in mission plans. MAJCOMs and units may expand these criteria or use more restrictive criteria
       for designating Critical Profiles.
       1.4.2.2. Any required track meeting the user’s need that places the RPV within 10 seconds (for
       Sub-scale) or 60 seconds (for FSAT) of the predefined range boundary. Base time on a turn to 90
       degrees convergence at the anticipated air speed.
       1.4.2.3. Any required altitude meeting the user’s need that places the RPV at or below the mini-
       mum altitude at which the system was designed to operate reliably.
       1.4.2.4. Any presentation placing the RPV at or beyond line-of-sight control or tracking capabili-
       ties.
       1.4.2.5. Any presentation requiring the RPV to maneuver at the limits of its aerodynamic capabil-
       ities or in excess of known subsystem limitations.
       1.4.2.6. Any required presentation which saturates control system capabilities, including the RPV
       controller.
       1.4.2.7. For FSAT RPV missions, when economics do not justify man-rating an FSAT for an
       operational check flight prior to unmanned flight; but an RPV mission is nevertheless desired.
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                     9


   1.4.3. Critical Profile Approval. When informed of a proposed Critical Profile mission, the using
   command evaluates the mission to determine if benefits warrant mission execution. If approved, own-
   ing MAJCOM concurrence and HQ AFSC notification are also required prior to flight. To expedite
   this process, RPV units will provide written notification to the owning MAJCOM and an information
   copy to AFSC/SEF of the Critical Profile request, a short risk assessment, and notification of intent to
   fly NLT one week prior to mission execution. Approval from the owning and using MAJCOMs con-
   stitutes execution authority. Within one week, verbal concurrence is required prior to flight, followed
   by written documentation of concurrence. Using and owning MAJCOMs establish approval authori-
   ties based on the risks associated with various critical profiles.

1.5. Parachute Recovered RPV Costs. Include the repair costs or loss involved related to abnormal
events or clearly excessive damage. Abnormal events include torn parachutes, late recovery initiation,
failure of a parachute to blossom or release, high winds, etc. Excessive damage includes buckling of the
main fuselage, fire at impact, destruction of the payload section, etc. Do not include the cost of expected
damage to parachute-recovered RPVs resulting solely from surface/water impact during an otherwise nor-
mal recovery sequence. This is an operational expense and not reportable. Do not include cost of recovery
since recovery is normally a mission objective for recoverable RPVs.

                                          RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1. Responsibilities of the Interim Safety Board (ISB) President. The ISB President will:
     2.1.1. Preserve evidence following guidelines established in AFPAM 91-211, USAF Guide to Avia-
     tion Safety Investigation.
     2.1.1. (AMC) For Class A and B mishaps, if a SIB president has not been appointed, evidence at a
     mishap scene may be disturbed after coordination/approval from AMC/SEF.
        2.1.1.1. Record the name, office symbol, and phone number of each provider of AF or DoD
        records, including photographs, videos, and ATC tapes.
            2.1.1.1.1. USAF and DoD photographers should include their name, office symbol and date
            on each photograph or set of photographs, or videotape.
        2.1.1.2. Request the name, address, and telephone number of bystanders who provide evidence of
        any kind, placing that information on any photographs or videos provided, including the date of
        the photograph or recording.
     2.1.2. Ensure all equipment associated with the mishap is impounded and turned over to the perma-
     nent SIB. Notify other bases with involved equipment (including aerial tankers) of the need for
     impoundment.
     2.1.3. Coordinate with HQ AFSC/SEFE (DSN 246-5867) on the removal and shipping of Flight Data
     Recorders (FDR) and/or Cockpit Voice Recorders (CVR) prior to the permanent SIB’s arrival. The
     ISB should not hesitate to send FDRs and CVRs upon coordination with HQ AFSC/SEFE. Delays in
     shipping could needlessly extend the SIB’s timeline.
     2.1.4. Ensure the ISB medical officer and mortuary office (when assigned by the command) collect
     and preserve life sciences evidence in a Class A or B Aircraft mishap.
        2.1.4.1. Preserve perishable evidence (to include video and still photography at the mishap site),
        collect laboratory samples, complete radiological studies, and obtain initial witness statements.
        2.1.4.2. Ensure evidence not associated with human remains (life support equipment, aircraft
        egress systems, etc.) is left undisturbed at the mishap site until the evidence is turned over to the
        SIB or when directed by the SIB President.
        2.1.4.3. Contact the Armed Force Institute of Pathology (AFIP) to coordinate forensic pathology
        assistance. AFIP can be reached via telephone at any time through DSN 285-0000 or commercial
        (301) 319-0000.
        2.1.4.4. Contact HQ AFSC/SEFL if further assistance is needed. Guidance for the interim board
        medical officer is also found in AFI 48-125 The US Air Force Personnel Dosimetry Program and
        AFPAM 91-211 USAF Guide To Aviation Safety Investigation.

2.2. Deployed Unit Safety Operations.
     2.2.1. When an aviation mishap occurs during wartime or contingency operations, the Convening
     Authority will investigate the mishap, subject to access restrictions imposed by the Theater Com-
     mander. Reference AFI 91-204, paragraph 2.12.
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                    11


  2.2.2. Aviation mishaps occurring during wartime or contingency operations may present unique
  challenges. Logistics and transportation for SIB members may preclude the investigation from being
  completed within established timeline guidance. Additionally, access to crash sites may not be possi-
  ble if the aircraft is behind the Forward Edge of the Battle Area (FEBA) or in hostile territory. ISBs
  will endeavor to capture as much data as possible to assist the SIB (weather, flight crew records, flight
  plans, etc.).

                            PRIVILEGED SAFETY INFORMATION

3.1. General Information. Follow guidance listed in AFI 91-204, Chapter 3. There is no additional avi-
ation specific guidance.
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                    13

                     DETERMINING INVESTIGATIVE RESPONSIBILITY

4.1. Mishap Ownership. OPCON and TACON Considerations. Operational or Tactical control of an air-
craft or UAV does not change mishap ownership. Class A and B mishaps will be investigated by the own-
ing organization, IAW AFI 91-204. Expeditionary forces staffed with a Flight Safety Officer may conduct
Class C mishap and Class E event investigations at the request of the mishap owner and upon approval of
the deployed expeditionary Wing Commander or equivalent.

4.2. Mishaps Involving Civil Aviation and/or Federal Air Traffic Services. Cooperation between
NTSB, FAA, and the Air Force in these investigations is essential. Reference AFI 91-204, paragraphs
2.7.7. and 4.8. Mishaps involving Civil Air Patrol USAF members or Air Force contractors flying Civil
Air Patrol owned assets, on approved Air Force missions, will be handled per AFI-204 and this manual.
Mishaps involving Civil Air Patrol volunteers or CAP Corporation employees will be handled by the
NTSB/FAA
   4.2.1. USAF Aero Club Mishaps. For mishaps involving Air Force Aero Clubs, the NTSB is the lead
   investigating agency. Follow sports and recreation mishap reporting guidance from AFMAN 91-224.
   In case the NTSB or designated representative agency does not investigate, the host wing commander
   may direct the wing safety office to conduct an investigation. Exception: For mishaps occurring out-
   side the United States, the host nation civil aviation authority may have jurisdiction and investigative
   authority.
       4.2.1.1. The Chief of Safety (COS) at the host wing will appoint a Flight Safety Officer (FSO) to
       assist/conduct Aero Club mishap investigations. In units with no active flying mission, the COS
       will appoint a ground safety technician to assist with Aero Club investigations.
       4.2.1.2. Aero Club mishaps investigated by the wing safety office are conducted under Services
       AFIs using AFI 91-204 and this manual only as a guide. Any reports of Aero Club mishaps are not
       privileged. The only exception is investigation of Aero Club mishaps when Aero Club aircraft are
       performing USAF directed missions. If on a USAF directed mission, investigate IAW 91-204 and
       this manual.
   4.2.2. AF Participation in NTSB Investigations. Reference AFI 91-206(I). The Air Force may take
   part in NTSB-led investigations. If the Air Force does take part in such an investigation or public
   hearing, it does so as “a party to” the investigation or hearing. Air Force representatives to NTSB
   investigations will be graduates of formal Air Force safety training courses. Colonels and above will
   be graduates of the Air Force’s Board Presidents Course. All others will be graduates of the FSO
   course or Aircraft Mishap Investigation Course (AMIC). Air Force representatives to NTSB investi-
   gations are responsible to AF/SE while assigned to the NTSB investigation.
   4.2.2. (AMC) For mishaps involving civil aircraft under contract or charter to AMC, HQ AMC/SE
   may, if requested/approved by the appropriate authority provide an observer to the NTSB or FAA
   investigation. This member should be identified within 24 hours of mishap notification. Subordinate
   units may be tasked to fulfill this requirement.
   4.2.3. FAA Participation in USAF Investigations. When a military flight mishap involves a function
   of the FAA, the Convening Authority will allow the FAA to participate in the military investigation.

     FAA participants must sign nondisclosure of privileged information agreements. If a military investi-
     gation concludes FAA personnel or facilities were causal in the mishap, comply with AFI 91-206(I).

                                     SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS

5.1. General Guidelines. Convening an Investigation. The convening authority determines the size and
scope of the investigation required for each mishap, subject to AFI 91-204 and this manual. Table 5.1.
establishes the minimum requirements. For ARC Class B mishaps, these requirements are recommended.
The convening authority will identify additional members as necessary to thoroughly investigate and doc-
ument a mishap. The convening authority may request a waiver to the minimum requirements by contact-
ing AFSC/SEF.

Note 1: By CSAF direction, an AFSC Representative is a required member on all Class A investigations
involving a destroyed aircraft or a fatality. AFSC representation on other SIBs will be considered in those
cases where AF/SE or the convening authority deems AFSC representation crucial due to the nature of the
mishap and the significant and broad-reaching implications to the Air Force. In those cases, AF/SE will
determine availability and extent of participation.

Note 2: An engine confined FOD mishap is defined to be a mishap that occurs when an object or objects
external to the engine cause damage to the engine and all the damage is confined to the engine and inte-
gral engine components. Damage is considered confined to the engine if there is less than $20,000 dam-
age external to the engine. If the total cost of all damage external to the engine is $20,000 or more, the
engine confined FOD classification does not apply
     5.1.1. Single Investigating Officer (SIO). The convening authority may appoint a SIO for Class C
     mishaps and Class E events when the investigation is not technically complex.
     5.1.2. The SIB member or single investigator activities prescribed by this instruction take precedence
     over all other duties.

5.2. Safety Investigation Board Member Roles. SIB members will fall into one of four categories: Pri-
mary members, “Conditional” Primary members, Secondary members, and Observers. Reference
AFPAM 91-211 for member duties and checklists.
5.2. (AMC) Safety Investigation Board Member Roles. Wing members who will potentially be identi-
fied to serve on either an ISB or SIB should train a minimum of once per year during unit Major Accident
Response Exercises (MAREs).
     5.2.1. Primary SIB Members. Primary SIB members determine findings, causes, and recommenda-
     tions and may submit minority reports if they do not agree with the BP in the outcome of the investi-
     gation. Primary members will be relieved of all non-SIB duties, and include the following positions:
     5.2.1. (AMC) The ANG or AFRC may provide a non-primary or primary board member on ANG or
     AFRC mishaps in which investigative authority is retained by AMC.
        5.2.1.1. Board President (BP). The BP is in charge of the SIB, is the final decision authority, and
        reports directly to the Convening Authority.
        5.2.1.2. Investigating Officer (IO). The IO is responsible for daily SIB activities, the investiga-
        tion, and preparing of reports/messages. Directs and coordinates activities of other board mem-
        bers, and works with AFSC Rep to “manage” the SIB.
        5.2.1.3. AFSC Representative. Acts as the investigation process expert, to guide SIB analysis
        efforts. Conducts “refresher training” of SIB procedures and is familiar with technical assistance
        resources which may be required by the SIB.
        5.2.1.4. Pilot Member (UAV Air Vehicle Operator or Mission Commander for UAV mishaps).
        Analyzes operations factors, to include qualifications, proficiency, training, communications, and
        aircrew actions throughout mishap sequence. Analyzes mission-specific concerns, performance
        data, and aircrew stressors.
        5.2.1.5. Maintenance Member. Analyzes maintenance factors, to include pre-mishap status of
        mishap aircraft, aircraft systems, maintenance qualifications, proficiency and, training. Evaluates
        depot and QA actions, as well as possible design/engineering deficiencies.
        5.2.1.6. Medical Member. Analyzes medical/human factors and egress/life support equipment
        and function. Evaluates medical histories, records, laboratory, radiologic, and pathology reports.
        Determines the cause(s) of injuries or death.
     5.2.2. “Conditional” Primary Members. Depending upon the mishap circumstances, the following
     members will be identified by either the convening authority or the SIB to provide specialized exper-
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                        17


  tise. If their area of expertise relates to a factor that was integrally involved in initiating or sustaining
  the mishap sequence, these individuals are required SIB members and are accorded Primary Member
  status. If the BP determines the conditional member’s area of expertise is not a factor in the mishap,
  this member serves as a secondary member.
      5.2.2.1. Additional crewmembers (navigator, loadmaster, etc.) qualified in the mishap aircraft.
      5.2.2.2. Life Support Officer or NCO, if life support equipment is known or suspected to have
      been a factor in the mishap or may have contributed to injuries. This member is required for all
      ejection seat equipped aircraft.
      5.2.2.3. Airfield Operations Officer/SNCO when Air Traffic Control or Airfield Management are
      involved.
      5.2.2.3. (AMC) HQ AMC/SE coordinates with HQ AMC/A36A when an air traffic control
      (ATC) officer is required. This will normally be a field grade officer (or an equivalent civilian),
      Air Force specialty code 13M3, with a minimum of 5 years ATC experience.
      5.2.2.4. Weather Officer, when weather or meteorological service is involved.

      and send a representative when they have test responsibilities.
      5.2.2.8. Jumpmaster, if the mishap involved personnel airdrop operations.
      5.2.2.9. Other Service Representatives (USN, USA, USMC, and/or USCG) when their aircraft,
      facilities, materiel, or personnel are involved and they elect to participate. The non-AF members
      will actively participate in the investigation and aid in report preparation. The Convening Author-
      ity determines whether they are accorded primary member status. Depending upon the extent of
      involvement, other services may provide a qualified investigator to serve as an assistant IO on the
      SIB.
      5.2.2.10. Crash Fire & Rescue (CFR) Specialist, if CFR response, actions or failures played a
      major role or contributed significantly to the extent of damage or injuries.
  5.2.3. Secondary Members. Secondary members assist the SIB in mishap investigation and reporting.
  The BP determines the extent of their participation and they are not authorized to submit a minority
  report. The following secondary members may be required, depending upon the mishap circum-
  stances.
      5.2.3.1. Recorder. An officer or SNCO familiar with administrative procedures and experienced
      in the use of typical office computer software.
      5.2.3.2. Human Factors Consultant. If the SIB suspects significant, complex human factors issues
      were present in the mishap, a consultant with more narrowly focused human factors expertise may
      be beneficial to the medical officer. Such consultants include aerospace physiologists, aviation
      psychologists, pilot physicians, or aerospace medicine specialists. The SIB will coordinate with
18                                                   AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005


        the convening authority as early as possible in the investigation if a human factors consultant is
        desired. The MAJCOM SG and/or HQ AFSC/SEFL may act in an advisory capacity to assist in
        determining the most appropriate type of consultant. Normally, the MAJCOM/SG will (when
        required) appoint a human factors consultant to assist the medical member in the investigation.
        When the convening authority is below MAJCOM level, this authority may be delegated to the
        Commander of the local Medical Treatment Facility (MTF/CC), depending on the mishap circum-
        stances. The MTF/CC, in consultation with their Chief of Aerospace Medicine (Senior Flight Sur-
        geon), will then appoint a human factors consultant to assist the investigation.
        5.2.3.3. Representatives of the involved aircraft/item Single Manager or Air Force test organiza-
        tion.
        5.2.3.4. Representatives from the FAA or NTSB, if appropriate. See AFI 91-204 paragraph 4.8
        and AFI 91-206(I).
        5.2.3.5. Commander’s Representative. The BP or commander whose aircraft or operator was
        involved in the mishap may request a commander’s rep, subject to convening authority approval.
        The Commander’s Representative’s role is to provide information to the SIB regarding opera-
        tional and organizational details and practices.
        5.2.3.6. Air Force Flight Standards Agency representative, if instrument flight procedures or pub-
        lications are involved. The convening commander coordinates with AFFSA/XO, Andrews AFB
        MD 20331-7002, DSN 857-4702 or -2128 for assistance.
        5.2.3.7. Personnel determined by HQ AFSC/JA to be necessary and appropriate under coopera-
        tive agreements. (An example would be foreign military representatives.)
        5.2.3.8. Technical personnel with expertise in specific systems or other needed fields.
        5.2.3.9. Administrative Specialists. NCOs or airmen that can help the SIB with administrative
        tasks such as making formal reports, running errands, answering phones, or filing. Most SIBs will
        have at least one.
     5.2.4. Observers. Civil aviation, foreign military, and sister service personnel may request to observe
     the Air Force investigation. An observer is not a member of the Air Force SIB. Requests are approved
     by AF/SE followed by the convening authority. Observers may participate to the extent authorized by
     the BP. Consult AFSC/JA on limitations regarding access to privileged information and witness inter-
     views by SIB observers. Reference AFI 91-204, paragraph 5.4.4.

     to anyone outside the SIB, except as explicitly authorized by the SIB President.

5.4. Investigative Evidence.
     5.4.1. Flight Data Recorders (FDR) and/or Cockpit Voice Recorders (CVR). The Mishap Analysis
     and Animation Facility (MAAF) at HQ AFSC is the central Air Force activity for recovery, transcrip-
     tion, and analysis of FDR and CVR data in support of Air Force safety investigations. Coordinate with
     HQ AFSC/SEFE (DSN 246-5867) on the removal and shipping of Flight Data Recorders (FDR) and/
     or Cockpit Voice Recorders (CVR) as soon as possible. The ISB should not delay sending FDRs and
     CVRs after coordination with HQ AFSC/SEFE. Delays in shipping could needlessly extend the SIB’s
     timeline.
     5.4.2. Bird or Wildlife Strikes. In case of bird or wildlife strikes, the investigating flight safety office
     will:
        5.4.2.1. For every bird strike, send remains (if available) to the Smithsonian National Museum of
        Natural History for identification. Remains may include feet, beak, and/or feathers. If no remains
        are apparent, spray blood smear with water and blot with a clean paper towel. Fold towel and place
        into labeled zip-loc bag. Send a copy of the corresponding AFSAS report with the strike evidence
        to the following address: “Smithsonian Institution, Feather Identification Lab, NHBE 610 MRC
        116, PO Box 37012, Washington, DC 20013-7012.” For high priority mishap identifications ship
        remains via overnight delivery to the following address: “Smithsonian Institution, Feather Identi-
        fication Lab, NHBE 610 MRC 116, 10th and Constitution Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20560.” To
        ensure overnight delivery, time shipments to the Smithsonian to arrive Monday - Friday. If you
        collect a whole bird carcass, place it in a freezer and contact the Smithsonian at (202) 357-2334 to
        see if the museum can use the specimen in their collection. Remains found on the runway as the
        result of a suspected aircraft strike should also be recorded into AFSAS and sent to the Smithso-
        nian for identification. Once the Smithsonian has entered the identification into the AFSAS report,
        AFSAS will automatically notify the reporting unit of the species identification through email.
        Bird remains recovered from a mishap site should be collected IAW instructions outlined in the
        paragraph above. The ISB should not delay recovering and shipping remains to the Smithsonian
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                      21


     Institution, as the sample could be compromised. If there are any questions, contact HQ AFSC/
     SEFW (DSN) 246-5679.
     5.4.2.2. For wildlife strikes other than birds, send samples of skin, fur, teeth or other non-fleshy
     remains, if possible, or a photograph of the remains along with the corresponding AFSAS report
     to the Smithsonian for identification.
  5.4.3. Photographic evidence. Digital and video images can be effectively used as evidence. Ensure
  each photograph or set of photographs, or videotapes, has been labeled with the name and office sym-
  bol of the photographer. Photos/videos, which did not suggest SIB analysis, are non-privileged. Pho-
  tos/videos that indicate interpretation or analysis are privileged. Still images that are privileged should
  be marked as such to include use of digital watermarks/coding on digital photos or video. Ensure all
  images are properly protected from inadvertent release to the public, especially those identified as
  privileged. Only the SIB BP/SIO has the authority to release electronic images, following the guid-
  ance in AFI 91-204, paragraph 5.13. While the SIB is ongoing, local PA personnel should consult with
  the SIB BP before publication of crash photos to determine the appropriate classification.
  5.4.4. Removing Wreckage from the Mishap Scene. The SIB may request wreckage recovery assis-
  tance from the nearest military base through the On-Scene Commander.
     5.4.4.1. Underwater Salvage. If recovery or salvage of floating debris and/or submerged wreck-
     age is required but is beyond the capabilities of the base concerned, the convening authority may
     contract with commercial salvage operations or request help from the US Navy, as follows:
         5.4.4.1.1. Contact Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn.: Supervisor of Salvage

        5.4.5.4. If, after all reasonable efforts are taken, there is wreckage still remaining that cannot be
        reasonably removed, obtain authorization from the appropriate federal or state officials to leave
        the wreckage in place. If permission is obtained, obliterate or mark all wreckage not removed from
        the mishap scene, according to one of the following procedures, in the order of preference:
            5.4.5.4.1. Dismantle the wreckage as much as possible and bury the residue when terrain
            accessibility and laws permit.
            5.4.5.4.2. Have qualified explosives ordnance disposal (EOD) personnel demolish the wreck-
            age to scatter parts in small pieces over the widest area possible, using established procedures.
            Coordinate with the responsible civil authorities and take care to prevent forest fires or dam-
            age to public or private property.
            5.4.5.4.3. Mark all wreckage with a large and conspicuous yellow painted cross. Give the
            exact location of the wreckage by coordinates, together with photographs showing configura-
            tion of wreckage, to the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC), Langley AFB VA
            23665-2789, DSN 574-8112, commercial (800) 851-3051.
            5.4.5.4.4. If wreckage is so inaccessible the standard demolition or painting methods cannot
            be used, carefully plot and photograph it from as low an altitude as practical. Provide the exact
            wreckage coordinates and photographs showing the wreckage configuration to air search
            activities and the AFRCC.
     5.4.6. Disposing of Evidence.
        5.4.6.1. Provide post-tear-down request (TDR) disposition instructions for all hardware sent for
        TDR. The SIB/SIO must remind the laboratory to not destroy or release the hardware to anyone
        until receiving written approval from the SIB or a follow on AIB, as applicable.
        5.4.6.2. Ensure the AIB President knows the wreckage and/or mishap involved aircraft/compo-
        nents is available and acknowledges custodial responsibility, in writing. Tell the host installation
        commander of the transfer. If the AIB President is not available and the SIB is prepared to release
        the wreckage or mishap involved aircraft/components, release to the host installation commander
        or his/her designee, who will maintain custody until the AIB President is able to accept. If there is
        not a follow on AIB, transfer custody of the vehicle and all related parts to the installation com-
        mander. Transfer may be made to tenant units, as appropriate, with written agreement between the
        installation commander and tenant unit commander.
        5.4.6.3. All wreckage or mishap involved aircraft/components from Class A mishaps must be
        retained and stored at the host installation or other appropriate storage area until a formal release
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                   23


      from AFLSA/JACT is obtained for appropriate disposal or repair. In unique circumstances, with
      the approval of the convening authority, AFLSA/JACT may release before an AIB is convened.
      Contact the host installation Staff Judge Advocate to obtain release from AFLSA/JACT. The
      wreckage release request from the host installation to AFLSA/JACT must be made through the
      MAJCOM/JA. (reference AFI 51-503, paragraph 10.7) After release is obtained, return Air Force
      equipment not damaged beyond repair to the possessing organization. Before deciding whether
      the basic airframe is damaged beyond repair, contact the prime center for the aircraft and allow
      them to survey the wreckage. A wreckage release by AFLSA/JACT is not a disposal authorization
      but is a release from legal hold. Those in possession of wreckage must further comply with T.O
      1-1-638, Repair and Disposal of Aerospace Vehicles, prior to any subsequent disposal decision.
      The custodian is required notify the Maintenance Training Device (MTD) community prior to dis-
      posal. In addition, compliance with other applicable instructions, to include AFMAN 23-110,
      USAF Supply Manual, Volume 6, Excess and Surplus Personal Property, may be necessary prior
      to any subsequent disposal action. (reference AFI 51-503, paragraphs 10.7.3 and 3.5.4.1) The
      wreckage can then be turned over to DRMO for disposal. Components subjected to a crash or fire
      environment must be carefully evaluated by responsible systems engineering personnel who are
      cognizant of the crash environment before permitting any further use. The possessing agency must
      contact the System Program Office for inspection, disposition or shipping instructions. Items
      returned to the source of repair through the supply system must be tagged with a DD Form 1575
      and AFTO Form 350. Annotate with: “Removed from Class A mishap number (include the
      assigned mishap number). Engineering evaluation required.” Do not place components from crash
      damaged aircraft into the supply system without these safeguards.
      5.4.6.4. If any physical evidence has been sent for analysis and not returned to the SIB, advise the
      AIB of that information and notify the possessor to return the evidence to the AIB. If there is no
      AIB, advise the possessor to return the evidence to the owning unit, or obtain authorization for
      other disposition.
      5.4.6.5. Return usable personal equipment or protective gear that is USAF property to possessors
      of record or to the issuing authority, subject to the prior needs of the SIB and AIB. Clearly mark
      the item to indicate its involvement in a mishap to ensure the necessary inspections are accom-
      plished prior to reissue.
      5.4.6.6. Quickly analyze personal items impounded as investigative evidence, and return them to
      the owner, summary court officer, or next of kin, through the AIB. If there is not an AIB, coordi-
      nate with the servicing legal office. Contact HQ AFSC/JA for assistance if necessary.

5.5. Deficiency Reporting Procedures.
   5.5.1. If a SIO or SIB suspects that a component may be deficient, submit a deficiency report (DR)
   IAW TO 00-35D-54 USAF Deficiency Reporting and Investigating System. Do not attempt field dis-
   assembly of the exhibit.
   5.5.2. Category I DRs are normally submitted for Class A mishaps and Category II DRs are normally
   submitted for Class B and C mishaps. See TO 00-35D-54 for more information. Consider initiating a
   Category I DR for Class C mishaps and Class E events items, if a potential exists for the item to cause
   a future Class A mishap. Verbally request priority teardown of suspect components by coordinating
   with the single manager (SM).

     5.5.3. If assistance is required to determine where to send a DR exhibit, contact HQ AFSC/SEFE. In
     most cases, teardown and analysis will be conducted by a DOD facility. Do not directly contact con-
     tractors or vendors for teardown and analysis without first speaking to the SM or HQ AFSC/SEFE.
     5.5.4. Handle and ship exhibits according to TO 00-35D-54. TO 2J-1-18, Engine Shipping Instruc-
     tions, explains how to mark engines for teardown. Ensure the mishap event number is referenced in I
     90 field of the Deficiency Report. Enter the Deficiency Report Control Number into AFSAS under
     Failed Parts. Include exhibit disposition instructions in all DRs (e.g., return exhibit to originator). Do
     not dispose of exhibits sent from Class A mishaps or mishaps involving potential litigation until
     authorized by the Air Force Legal Service Agency (AFLSA)/JACT. Store these exhibits at either the
     facility that performed the analysis, or return the exhibit to the SIB, AIB, or the host installation com-
     mander, as appropriate. Take follow-up actions to ensure exhibits were received and teardowns are
     progressing in a timely manner.
     5.5.5. Place a copy of all teardown reports, including all supporting documents (e.g. metallurgical
     analyses, photographs, test reports, etc…), provided in response to DRs in the formal report.
     5.5.6. The convening authority safety office takes follow-up action if the final safety report was sent
     before receipt of all TDRs. If final exhibit disposition instructions were not included in the original
     request for TDR, the convening authority safety office will provide them to the SM.

5.6. Coordinating with an AIB. The SIB BP coordinates with the AIB BP regarding the AIB BP’s ini-
tial view of the mishap site and refers to the AIB BP any requests from the media or next of kin to view
the mishap site or obtain access to the wreckage or the personal property of the deceased. The SIB BP pro-
vides certain factual information to the AIB legal adviser as soon as possible, as specified in AFI 51-503
and below. DO NOT release SIB analysis, findings, causes, recommendations, or comments/references to
witness statements. DO NOT release videotapes of simulated, computer-generated, animated or
re-enacted portions of the mishap flight if they involved SIB analysis. DO NOT release SIB medical anal-
yses.
     5.6.1. For Class A mishaps, or when notified there will be a legal board for other mishaps, provide all
     non-privileged evidence to the legal board. Evidence not included in Tabs A-S should be transferred
     in writing, in a memo to the AIB BP signed by the SIB BP. The legal board will be responsible for
     final disposition of all material released to them by the SIB. For other than Class A mishaps, contact
     the host installation staff judge advocate for guidance on disposing of materials that may be needed in
     potential claims or litigation. If there are no such requirements, reproduce enough copies for the safety
     report and then return the original documents and records to their proper custodian.
     5.6.2. The SIB BP may provide factual (non-privileged) information to AIB members as it becomes
     available, but not to the detriment of the safety investigation. This information includes logs, direc-
     tives, unstaged photographs, and all pre-mishap medical records. Also provide recordings/transcripts
     of air-to-air, air-to-ground, ground-to-air voice transmissions, as well as cockpit voice recorder (CVR)
     and flight data recorder (FDR) tapes and data that capture information at the time of the mishap. Tapes
     of aircrew conversations are not protected by the military safety privilege, but under Air Force policy,
     they are not released to the public. Transcripts are releasable. Only those individuals with a need to
     know will be allowed to hear the actual voice recording of the CVR.
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                   25


     5.6.2.1. CVR tapes and transcripts are not privileged. The CVR tapes will be transcribed. Limit
     the transcript included in Part 1 of the report to conversation relevant to the mishap sequence of
     events. Deletions should be indicated.
     5.6.2.2. If the recorded voices of the mishap crew are incorporated into an animation, simulation,
     or reenactment video which is not otherwise privileged, the video is provided to the AIB. For fatal
     mishaps, under Air Force policy, a video with recorded voices of the mishap crew is not releasable
     due to the privacy interests of the crewmembers or the surviving family members.
     5.6.2.3. Provide original films and videotapes which depict the actual mishap sequence to the AFI
     51-503 Accident Investigation Board. This includes videotape recordings (VTR) of the heads-up
     display (HUD). Include copies of non-official videotapes or films made by individuals and return
     tapes to original owners.
     5.6.2.4. Videotapes of simulated, computer-generated, animated or re-enacted portions of a mis-
     hap flight are always privileged if they were made with the involvement of either SIB personnel or
     personnel with knowledge of privileged mishap information. Do not release them to the AIB Pres-
     ident.
     5.6.2.5. The SIB President or SIO releases the wreckage and/or mishap involved aircraft/compo-
     nents to the AIB President after the SIB no longer needs it.
     5.6.2.6. Give a complete list of all witnesses to the AFI 51-503 Accident Investigation Board
     regardless of whether the statements of the witnesses are in the safety report. Include contact
     information such as addresses and telephone numbers. Do not include this list in the safety report.
     Provide the names of witnesses to the AIB only after the SIB decides to conduct no further inter-
     views of any of the witnesses (Contact HQ AFSC/JA for guidance in unusual mishaps where the
     SIB may release witnesses to the AIB before completing interviews of all witnesses).
  5.6.3. Notify the AIB in writing if any aircraft parts have not been returned from Air Force and/or
  contractor laboratories and give the AIB contact information so they may retrieve the parts or docu-
  ment their whereabouts.
  5.6.4. Release medical information as discussed below. Protect information subject to the Privacy
  Act. Do not release medical analyses by a SIB. 72 Hour and 14 Day aircrew medical histories are priv-
  ileged. The AIB will gather their own 72 Hour and 14 Day medical histories from the aircrew and/or
  mishap participants involved. Do not release post-mishap physical examination interview narratives
  gathered by ISB or SIB members. Release the following medical information to the AIB:
     5.6.4.1. Factual photos showing human remains and the autopsy are turned over to the AIB Pres-
     ident in a separate envelope. Provide instructions to the AIB to return the photographs to HQ
     AFSC/SEFL, 9700 Ave G SE, Kirtland AFB, NM, 87117 after the AIB is finished with them.
     5.6.4.2. Copies of the toxicological test results, coroner’s and/or autopsy report, and death certif-
     icate.
     5.6.4.3. Pre-mishap medical records, factual post-mishap radiographs (X-rays, MRI, CT scans),
     factual lab reports, and factual post-mishap physical examinations (SF 88).
     5.6.4.4. Provide copies of any records or materials required or used in the identification process
     and copies of requested photographs of the deceased to the mortuary officer. Either AFIP or the
26                                                    AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005


        local flight surgeon may generate these products. HQ Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC)/
        MPCCM carefully controls and maintains these documents on permanent file.
     5.6.5. Many Technical Orders (TOs) are subject to the Arms Export Control Act and the Export
     Administration Act of 1979. Ensure TOs are not subject to the above Acts prior to including them in
     Part I of the SIB report. If the TOs are subject to the above acts, do not include these TOs in Part 1 of
     the SIB report without receiving clearance from the release authority. The release authority is nor-
     mally annotated near the front page of the document. If the release authority will not grant authority to
     release the TO, you can still provide the TO to the AIB. However, this should be done separately from
     the Part 1, Tabs A-S hand-off as is done with other sensitive information, e.g., autopsy reports. If a TO
     is not subject to the Arms Export Control Act or the Export Administration Act of 1979 or clearance
     is received from the release authority, include the clearance letter or determination of inapplicability
     with the TO pages in the Part I.

                                             Chapter 6

                                   REPORTS AND BRIEFINGS

6.1. General Information.
   6.1.1. Report and brief mishaps IAW AFI 91-204, Table 6.2, with the following exceptions:
      6.1.1.1. Engine confined FOD mishaps do not require a formal report, unless directed by the con-
      vening authority. A MOFE is not prepared for an engine confined FOD mishap, unless a formal
      report is completed. Reference Note 2 of Table 5.1 for the definition of an engine confined FOD
      mishap.
      6.1.1.2. When an engine or engine module is processed through the depot under the deficiency
      report (DR) system, the final report due date is extended to 60 days for Class B and Class C mis-
      haps.
      6.1.1.3. Class C mishaps do not require a preliminary message
      6.1.1.3. (AMC) For any aviation Class C mishap, if an OPREP report is not sent (or the investi-
      gator is unable to determine if an OPREP report was sent), a Preliminary Report will be sent and/
      or a phone call/email to HQ AMC/SEF (DSN 779-0930, amc.sef@scott.af.mil) will be accom-
      plished within 2 working days of incident date.
      6.1.1.4. Class E HATR and CMA events require a preliminary message within 10 workdays.
   6.1.2. Formal Report Waivers. USAF/SE, in conjunction with the investigating MAJCOM, may
   waive formal reports for mishaps that can be adequately documented with the final message alone.
   SIBs will forward their requests for waivers to the formal report through their MAJCOM/SE to HQ
   AFSC/SEFM for approval. As a general rule, USAF/SE will only consider waivers for mishaps
   involving known materiel deficiencies for which corrective actions have been established. USAF/SE
   normally will not waive formal reports for mishaps involving human factors. SIBs must continue their
   investigation and preparation of a formal report until receipt of USAF/SE approved waiver.
   6.1.3. The Air Force Safety Automation System (AFSAS) is the primary means for distributing mes-
   sages.
      6.1.3.1. Investigators will need an AFSAS user name and password to accomplish safety mes-
      sages. Contact the Convening Authority Safety Office for access.
      6.1.3.2. AFSAS login is available at the following URL: http://sas.kirtland.af.mil/
      6.1.3.3. Reference the AFSAS Aviation user’s guide, which can be downloaded from the AFSAS
      Aviation Module under the “Help/Docs” tab.
      6.1.3.4. Mishaps/events entered into AFSAS that no longer meet reportable criteria should be
      removed from AFSAS.
   6.1.4. Mishap event number. The mishap event number is vital to tracking safety reports. The mishap
   event number and AFSAS number should be referenced on all related correspondence, DRs, and
   endorsements. The mishap event number consists of sixteen characters, such as 20030118KLTS005A.
      6.1.4.1. Local date of Mishap. Use eight digits (YYYYMMDD).
28                                                   AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005


        6.1.4.2. Installation Code of unit that experienced the loss of the owned asset (property). Use the
        four letter International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code. If an ICAO code is not avail-
        able, use the Home Location Code from SORTS.
        6.1.4.3. Unit Control Number. Use separate sets of four-character combinations (three digits and
        one letter) for unit control numbers. (“Unit” means group equivalent or higher.) Assign the num-
        bers consecutively for each mishap for each fiscal year. MAJCOMs may assign block numbers for
        those disciplines requiring them. The last space designates the mishap or event class (A, B, C, D,
        or E). (005A in the example in paragraph 6.1.4.)
     6.1.5. Release of messages via DMS. If mishap classification or other circumstances require release
     via DMS, use the applicable message format found in Attachment 2. If the mishap is classified,
     release via secure means to the MAJCOM/SE, AF/SE, COMAFFOR/SE (if applicable), recommenda-
     tion OPRs, and other agencies that have a need to know. If the mishap is not classified, disseminate via
     address list (AL) 9391.
     6.1.6. “Common Service” Mishaps. Only the respective safety centers exchange formal safety reports
     between services. Requests for information regarding a safety investigation conducted by another US
     service will be directed to HQ AFSC/JA.
     6.1.7. Changes to Reports. Only the primary members of the safety board can make changes to the
     formal report. Issues raised by the Convening Authority comments messages will be considered dur-
     ing the review process to produce the MOFE. If the final SIB message and/or formal report need to be
     changed after it is completed and signed by the board, the primary members of the SIB will be recon-
     vened. For Class C mishaps and Class E events, convening authorities and MAJCOM safety staffs
     may make non-substantive changes to the reports in order to improve the quality of the reports. Feed-
     back to the affected unit safety office will ensure continuous improvement.
     6.1.8. For Class A and B mishaps, SIBs will forward draft copies (as soon as available) of their find-
     ings, causes, and recommendations and a brief narrative summary of the mishap, for review, for qual-
     ity control purposes. SIBs will forward their information to Convening Authority or MAJCOM/SEF
     and/or HQ AFSC/SEF for review. Reviewing safety specialists are to provide suggestions for accu-
     racy/effectiveness and do not supersede the judgment of the SIB/SIO.

6.2. Class E HATR and CMA Violation Reporting Procedures. HATR and CMA violation informa-
tion is vital to USAF aviation safety. Report HATR events using the AF Form 651. Report CMA viola-
tions using the AF Form 457. Reports completed by another agency such as the FAA do not alleviate the
responsibility of the safety office to submit a HATR if AF personnel or equipment are involved. Informa-
tion taken from these reports is intended primarily for mishap prevention. HATR and CMA violation
information are not privileged information and are releasable outside AF channels, with the exception of
the identity of the personnel involved. See paragraph 1.3.1.8. for reportable HATR events. See paragraph
1.3.1.9. for reportable CMA violation events.
     6.2.1. Responsibilities of the Unit Commander. Unit commanders will ensure AF Form 651 and AF
     Form 457 are available to aircrews at base operations facilities, flying squadron operations offices, in
     trip kits and in USAF ATC facilities. Commanders must emphasize the importance of identifying haz-
     ardous situations and direct the filing of appropriate HATRs or CMA violation events as a method of
     preventing future mishaps.
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                       29


   6.2.2. Responsibility of the Individual Filing the HATR/CMA violation. Any person (i.e. air traffic
   controller, pilot, safety officer, etc…) aware that a reportable event occurred will file a HATR or CMA
   violation. Report the details on AF Form 651 or AF Form 457 in the following manner:
      6.2.2.1. If the individual is at the AF base where the event occurred, file the report within 24
      hours to the base safety office.
      6.2.2.2. If the event occurred away from an AF installation, report the event to AF safety person-
      nel at the nearest AF safety office or the next landing location with a AF safety office.
   6.2.3. If an aircrew experiences a NMAC, and circumstances permit, immediately (e.g., while air-
   borne) inform the nearest ATC agency, civil aviation authority (CAA) for overseas events, or flight
   service station and provide the following information:
      6.2.3.1. Identification or call sign.
      6.2.3.2. Time and place (name of NAVAID, radial and distance, and GPS coordinates if available)
      of event.
      6.2.3.3. Altitude or flight level.
      6.2.3.4. Description of other aircraft in the event.
      6.2.3.5. Advise the controlling agency a written NMAC report will be filed and request that all
      available data be saved.
NOTE: Aircrews who experience a NMAC under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) control,
should immediately request that facility to initiate a FAA NMAC report.
   6.2.4. Responsibilities of the safety office receiving a HATR or CMA violation. Within 24 hours after
   notification of the event, the safety office receiving the report determines which safety office is
   responsible for the investigation. Fax the AF Form 651 or AF Form 457 to the appropriate safety
   office. Follow this order of priority:
      6.2.4.1. If applicable, comply with NATO STANAG 3750, Reporting
      and Investigation of Air Traffic Incidents.
      6.2.4.2. If foreign ATC or aircraft are involved, the overseas MAJCOM.
      6.2.4.3. For hazardous events reported by local base personnel, the AF safety office at that instal-
      lation.
      6.2.4.4. If no AF safety office available or if an airborne report is initiated by pilot or aircrew, the
      originator’s home station.
   6.2.5. Responsibilities of the Investigating Safety Office. The investigating safety office will:
      6.2.5.1. Determine if the reported event merits a HATR. Notify the individual or unit that filed the
      HATR of this determination and the pending actions. NOTE: TCAS RAs do not automatically
      merit a HATR. See paragraph 1.3.1.8.2.
      6.2.5.2. If the event is reportable, report the event via AFSAS as either a Class E HATR or Class
      E CMA. Note: Class E HATR and CMA messages should not contain findings.
      6.2.5.3. Determine which organizations were involved and request those offices’ assistance with
      the investigation. Notify:
30                                                  AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005


            6.2.5.3.1. The base Airfield Operations Flight Commander (AOF/CC), or equivalent, if
            USAF ATC or Airfield Management services were suspected to be involved. NOTE: Review
            ATC recordings needed for HATR investigations as quickly as possible; ATC recordings are
            routinely retained for only 15 days. Due to various types of recording equipment installed,
            review of ATC recordings are best conducted at the ATC facility. Coordinate times for review
            with the AOF/CC in order to minimize impact on support of flight operations.
            6.2.5.3.2. The base Communications Commander if NAVAIDs were suspected to be involved.
            6.2.5.3.3. The flying unit if local base aircraft were involved. If transient aircraft were
            involved, notify the aircrew’s unit of assignment safety office.
            6.2.5.3.4. The FAA facility or Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) if FAA ATC or civil
            aircraft were involved. NOTE: Contact the FAA Air Force Representative (AFREP) for help
            in notifying the proper facility or FSDO. See Table 6.1. for which AFREP to contact. Include
            the AFREP in these investigations as needed, especially if you are having difficulty getting
            information from the FAA.
        6.2.5.4. Complete Class E HATR and CMA preliminary message within 10 workdays. Submit a
        status message every 30 days until the final message was been transmitted. Submit the final mes-
        sage upon completion of the investigation.
        6.2.5.5. If ATC or airfield management is contributory to the event, the IO must contact the AOF/
        CC to assist in the investigation and advise on ATC/AM procedures. If additional expertise is
        desired from other than base personnel, contact the appropriate MAJCOM functional. The final
        portion of the narrative section of the AFSAS message must indicate if the AOF/CC concurs or
        non-concurs with the corrective actions and narrative wording. If the AOF/CC non-concurs, their
        explanation must follow their indication of non-concurrence in the narrative portion of the report.
        6.2.5.6. Notify the originator’s unit and MAJCOM, if required about corrective actions that the
        safety office has taken or recommends.
     6.2.6. Responsibilities of the AFREP at FAA Regional Offices. Review HATR and CMA violation
     events in their region involving FAA ATC or civil aircraft and provide assistance when requested.
     6.2.7. Responsibilities of the MAJCOM OPR for Safety.
        6.2.7.1. Receive and evaluate all HATR and CMA events for their command to ensure proper
        conclusions and resolutions. Coordinate with appropriate MAJCOM functional OPRs (e.g. air-
        field operations, civil engineering) to ensure comprehensive review is accomplished.
        6.2.7.2. Inform the HQ AFSC/SEF (ATC rep) of non-concurrence with corrective actions taken or
        recommended on all HATR and CMA events.
     6.2.8. Responsibilities of HQ Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA/XA) OPR for Airfield
     Operations. Review and evaluate all HATRs for trends and concerns that may have AF-wide implica-
     tions. Coordinate with MAJCOM Airfield Operations staffs to reconcile any discrepancies in conclu-
     sions and recommended corrective actions.
     6.2.9. Responsibilities of HQ AFSC OPR for HATR and CMA violation events. Administer the pro-
     gram and ensure the safety offices fully investigate the reports.

6.3. Life Sciences Safety Reporting.
     6.3.1. Report aeromedical, life support, egress and other human factors related to a mishap as life sci-
     ences safety information. Life sciences safety information is required for Class A, B, C and E mishaps
     and events for all personnel who are injured or whose actions/inactions contributed to the mishap
     sequence. Complete physical exams must be performed and documented on a SF 88 or SF 506 for all
     surviving aircrew for all Class A mishaps. Physical examinations for other mishap and event classes
     may be focused physical exams appropriate for the mishap. The extent of these examinations is at the
     discretion of the ISB medical member (or SIB medical member if there is no ISB). 72 hour and 14 day
     histories must be obtained from all relevant aircrew, ground or other personnel whose actions/inac-
     tions may have contributed to the mishap sequence for Class A and B mishaps. Since this determina-
     tion is often difficult during the initial stages of an investigation, the AFSC website (Life Sciences
     page) contains a template to aid in completion of these histories. AFPAM 91-211 USAF Guide to Avi-
     ation Safety Investigation also contains relevant information. Most USAF medical facilities have per-
     sonnel with additional life sciences expertise (aerospace physiologists, aviation psychologists, etc.),
     who may be valuable resources for ensuring accurate interpretation of life sciences safety information.
     These individuals may be consulted and can be tasked to support aviation safety investigations.
     6.3.2. Life sciences information is reported in Tab T and Tab Y of the formal report and in AFSAS.
     6.3.3. For mishaps and events without a formal report, report life sciences information via AFSAS.
     6.3.4. Classifying Injuries: See AFI 91-204 for definitions of injuries.
     6.3.5. FOD Mishaps. If a human is identified as the FOD source or if human actions contributed to
     the damage, conduct a thorough Human Factors investigation.
     6.3.6. Report Class E Physiological Events per paragraph 1.3.1.1. Include medically indicated lab test
     results and toxicological test results (when determined necessary by the commander or flight surgeon)
     for each affected person. For decompression sickness, trapped gas disorders and in-flight incapacita-
     tion, also include a 72-hour history with the standard report.
        6.3.6.1. The AF flight surgeon responding to the physiological event assists with the report. In sit-
        uations where an AF physician does not initially treat the mishap individual, the AF flight surgeon
        with final aeromedical disposition of the case assists the investigator.
        6.3.6.2. The life support officer must comment on any life support equipment failure or malfunc-
        tion contributing to a physiological mishap, describing corrective action taken as appropriate.
        6.3.6.3. Send unclassified or declassified original audiovisual tape or film (such as a head up dis-
        play VTR) concerning a physiological mishap to HQ AFSC/SEF within 30 calendar days. HQ
        AFSC/SEF will make a copy of the product, return the original to the sender, produce an enhanced
        master recording for training, and distribute it to authorized requesters.
     6.3.7. Consider human factors from both individual human performance and environmental, mission,
     and supervisory influence perspectives. The SIB rates identified human factors as one of the follow-
     ing: causal, major, minor, minimal, or present but not contributory. Medical members are tasked with
     accomplishing the human performance narrative. The human factors conclusions and ratings must
     reflect the SIB consensus.

6.4. Documenting the Investigation and Analysis. The investigation and analysis in formal reports and
final messages must be written so the reader clearly understands how the findings and causes were deter-
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                     33


mined. Additionally, some discussions concerning the logic in how the recommendations were chosen
must be included. Analyze data collected from witness testimony, technical evaluations, and other infor-
mation. Describe each area investigated and discuss its significance. Briefly discuss or list evidence with
little or no significance. Extensively analyze areas important in explaining the mishap. Summarize con-
clusions at the end of each investigation and analysis area. Use the guidance below for documenting the
investigation and analysis.
   6.4.1. Documenting Mishap Factors. A “factor” is any unusual, out-of-the-ordinary, or deficient
   action or condition discovered in the course of a mishap investigation, which in the SIB’s opinion con-
   tributed to the eventual outcome, or is indicative of a pattern of less than adequate decisions or condi-
   tions. Mishap factors explain why causes, such as pilot error, supervision, or equipment failure
   occurred. These factors are not mutually exclusive but are often interrelated and in some cases influ-
   ence each other. Most mishaps involve multiple mishap factors. For a thorough list of items to con-
   sider, see AFPAM 91-211, Attachment 4. Omit factors not applicable and add others as necessary to
   analyze the mishap. Some factors may form the basis for Other Findings of Significance (OFS) in the
   mishap sequence. Not all factors are findings.
       6.4.1.1. Factors are documented with the following areas: Factors, Non-Factors Worthy of Dis-
       cussion, and Non-Factors. Reference the narrative format in Attachment 2 for final messages.
       Reference Figure 6.3., Tab T outline, for formal reports.
           6.4.1.1.1. Factors accepted, with rationale as to why they contributed to the outcome of the
           mishap.
           6.4.1.1.2. Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion did not contribute to the mishap, but could con-
           tribute to future mishaps and/or which warrant command attention. Non-Factors Worthy of
           Discussion frequently provide the background information for OFSs. For Class A and B mis-
           haps, Non-Factors Worthy of Discussion should also include factors significantly deliberated
           and rejected, with rationale.
           6.4.1.1.3. Non-Factors are simply listed to communicate to the reader that these factors were
           considered in the investigation and analysis of the mishap, but were ruled out as non-contribu-
           tory. This listing does not have to be all-inclusive, but should areas of interest the SIB looked
           at. For Class A and B mishaps, if the SIB deliberated significantly to rule out a factor as not
           relevant to the mishap sequence, explain this analysis as a non-factor worthy of discussion.
   6.4.2. Identify hazards and risks within the mishap sequence and determine whether individuals or
   management directly addressed these particular factors during preparation and execution of the mis-
   hap sequence.

6.5. Formal Reports.
   6.5.1. General Information. Formal reports present both factual and analytical information. The SIB
   normally produces a formal safety report with two parts: Part I, Facts and Part II, Board Conclusions
   & Privileged Material. Part I contains non-privileged information, which is primarily factual, and may
   be disclosed outside the Air Force. Part II contains the privileged portions of the formal report and
   will not be disclosed. Formal non-privileged reports are assembled in one part. There is also a Part III,
   supplemental information, which is produced by AF/SE. It includes any comment to the final mes-
   sage, the message of final evaluation (MOFE), and any other significant information that was received
   after the final message is released. See for routing of formal reports.

     6.5.2. Electronic Formal Reports. Most copies of the formal report will be made electronically. SIBs
     creating electronic formal reports will use Microsoft Word and then convert them to an Adobe Acrobat
     .pdf files. Reports will be saved on CD-ROM media, preferably on a “CD/R.” The CD must be labeled
     with aircraft type and tail number, date and class of mishap, report copy number, and the safety privi-
     lege statement.
     6.5.3. Assembling The Formal Report.
        6.5.3.1. Assemble the report in a three ring binder. Use the USAF Mishap Report Checklist and
        Index, AF Form 711A, to indicate which Tabs are included in the formal report.
        6.5.3.2. Print on both sides of 8.5 by 11 inch paper. Use Times New Roman, 12 point, for text
        documents.
        6.5.3.3. Under Page Set-Up in Microsoft Word (for other word processing programs follow the
        intent of these guidelines):
            6.5.3.3.1. Set Top and Bottom margins to one inch.
            6.5.3.3.2. Select “Mirror Margins.” (If you do not have a duplex printer, this will set the mar-
            gins correctly for front-back reproduction. If you have a duplex printer this is the same as set-
            ting the left margin to 1.0 inches and deselecting “Mirror Margins”).
        6.5.3.4. Set header margin to .5 inches and ensure the following appears on each page of the
        report in the header block: “Aircraft Type, Aircraft Serial Number, and mishap event number”
        (e.g. F-15C, 85-0001, 19970516QKKA301C). Type it in 10 point Times New Roman, italicized
        and centered. Reference AFI 91-204, paragraph 6.1.2. for further details on determining mishap
        event numbers.
        6.5.3.5. Place a footer on each page in Part II of privileged safety reports using the Privilege
        Warning Statement from AFI 91-204, Figure A3.1.
        6.5.3.6. Arrange the tabs in alphabetical order, with Tab A on top. The first page of each tab will
        have the title of the tab, followed by a table of contents showing where to find information within
        each tab. Number all pages in order within the tab (for example, A-1, A-2, X-1, X-2, Y-1, Y-2).
        Center page numbers at the bottom of each page.
        6.5.3.7. For bulky two-part reports, place Part 1 and 2 in separate binders. For non-privileged
        reports, place all of the report in one binder of an appropriate size or suitable 8.5 by 11-inch
        heavy-duty folder.
        6.5.3.8. Formal Report Covers. Mark the covers of privileged formal reports using AFI 91-204,
        Figure A3.1 and add the following statement:
        COPYING OR RELEASING ANY PORTION OF THIS REPORT IS PROHIBITED WITHOUT
        THE EXPRESS WRITTEN PERMISSION OF AIR FORCE CHIEF OF SAFETY
        6.5.3.9. For classified pages and classified formal reports, use the proper security classification
        markings from AFI 31-401.
        6.5.3.10. Do not place special handling markings on unclassified pages in Part I of two-part for-
        mal reports, for example do not use “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” footers.
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                  35


     6.5.3.11. AF Form 711A, USAF Mishap Report Checklist and Index. Use this form to ensure
     reports are complete. Place an "X" for each item in the columns "Not Applicable," "Applicable
     Not Attached," or "Attached." Place the AF Form 711A in the front of the formal report.
     6.5.3.12. Formal Report Tabs. Investigations that have no data for certain tabs do not require
     waivers for those tabs. Example: Tab N, Transcripts of Voice Communications. If there are no
     recorded communications, the SIB will include a memo in the Tab N stating there was no such
     information available.
     6.5.3.13. Minority Reports. The primary members determine findings, causes, and recommenda-
     tions. Primary members that disagree with the results may submit individual minority reports.
     Minority reports must include reasons for disagreeing, and will include suggested findings and
     causes, and recommendations if different from those contained in the report. Sign the minority
     report and place it in Tab T. Also include it as part of the final mishap message.
  6.5.4. Part 1. Factual Information and Releasable Material.
     6.5.4.1. Tab A. Distribution Memorandum and Safety Investigator Information.
         6.5.4.1.1. A1. Distribution Memorandum. List all addressees receiving copies, extracts, or
         attachments to the formal report. Number and account for all copies of privileged reports by
         listing each addressee, including office symbol and copy number (reference Figure 6.2.).
         Include a statement, signed by the SIB president, certifying that the copies listed are the only
         copies of the SIB report produced. Current mailing addresses are located at:
         http://afsafety.af.mil/AFSC/RDBMS/Flight/SIB-Support/Formal-Report.htm
         6.5.4.1.2. A2. Orders appointing SIB. Include one copy of the orders appointing the SIB or
         SIO. The orders must contain the full name; rank/grade, SSAN, organization, assigned base,
         and whether they are a primary or secondary for each appointed person. Do not include admin-
         istrative specialist or SIB observers on SIB orders.
         6.5.4.1.3. A3. Contact Information for SIB members and advisors. Include DSN and Com-
         mercial Telephone numbers and email addresses for all SIB members and advisors. Contact
         information should be “permanent” rather than TDY contact information. This is to ensure
         SIB members and advisors are available during the follow-up process should any questions
         arise.

        6.5.4.8.1. H1. Egress Analysis. Include written analysis of an egress systems specialist if air-
        crew egress was attempted/completed or if the SIB determines analysis is needed to determine
        if egress was attempted.
        6.5.4.8.2. H2. Impact Analysis. Include technical specialist analysis of impact/wreckage and
        or burn patterns at the crash site if applicable.
        6.5.4.8.3. H3. Airframe Crashworthiness Analysis. Include if the investigation warrants this
        type of analysis.
     6.5.4.9. Tab I. Deficiency Reports. Include all DRs submitted in conjunction with the mishap
     investigation. Include a copy of the submitted DR report containing the following information:
     Report Control Number (RCN), Cognizant Official, name of part (nomenclature), and part num-
     ber.
     6.5.4.10. Tab J. Releasable Technical Reports and Engineering Evaluations. If DoD personnel
     provided written reports or on-scene evaluations, include them in this tab. Do not provide a prom-
     ise of confidentiality to DoD personnel. AFI 91-204, Figure 5.1 provides a format for these
     reports. Factual reports or information provided by a contractor or Joint ALC without a promise of
     confidentiality are placed in this tab. Any analysis referring to privileged information (e.g., wit-
     ness testimony, board conclusions, etc…) should be included in an addendum and placed in Tab
     W.
        6.5.4.10.1. These reports should determine what parts are bent, broken, or burned; whether it
        happened before, during, or after the mishap; and how, etc. These reports will not state that
        certain systems or parts, “did or did not cause the mishap.” The SIB will determine what
        caused the mishap, and that will appear in Tab T.
     6.5.4.11. Tab K. Mission Records and Data.
        6.5.4.11.1. K1. Flight Plan. DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, or authorized substitute flight
        plan forms. Include flight orders of the pilot or crew if prepared. Include a passenger manifest
        if the mishap aircraft was carrying passengers during the mishap flight. If there was no mani-
        fest, provide a list giving the complete name, and grade, of all crew and passengers.
        6.5.4.11.2. K2. Aircraft Weight and Balance. Include Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clear-
        ance Form F-Transport/Tactical. Include a copy of the weight and balance computations on
        file for the flight involved. If the SIB prepares a separate weight and balance form using avail-
        able data to determine weight and CG at the time the mishap occurred, do not include it here;
        instead, place it in Tab V of the report.
     6.5.4.12. Tab L. Data from On-Board Recorders.
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                    39


        6.5.4.12.1. L1. Crash Survivable Flight Data Recorder (CSFDR) Data. Printouts of important
        data should be included. Do not printout the entire data run from the CSFDR. Include this as a
        file in electronic formal reports or on electronic media (floppy disk or CD ROM) for
        hard-copy formal reports.
        6.5.4.12.2. L2. Seat Data Recorder Data. Printouts of seat data recorder should be included if
        available.
        6.5.4.12.3. L3. Video Tape Recorder (VTR) Recordings. Some aircraft have VTRs that record
        flight displays and voice communications. If available, these should be included as digital
        video files, preferably in a common format such as .MPEG. A Privacy Act Warning Statement
        will accompany all recordings of voice communications. SIBs will ensure they take steps to
        apply appropriate declassification procedures.
     6.5.4.13. Tab M. Data from Ground Radar and Other Sources.
        6.5.4.13.1. M1. Air Traffic Control Radar data and plots. Printout ATC plots and include them
        if available and applicable to the mishap.
        6.5.4.13.2. M2. Military Ground Radar, AWACS and Telemetry Data (e.g. NACTS, ACMI
        etc.). This data can be an invaluable aid to the investigator if available. Save as MPEG or sim-
        ilar files for the report. As a reminder, if this data is altered or overlaid with other communica-
        tions such as a separate voice recording, it will be considered analysis and is privileged.
        Additionally, ensure the classification level of this data is appropriately marked for the report
        you are accomplishing. Apply appropriate declassification procedures. Coordinate with HQ
        AFSC/SEFE and 84th Radar Evaluation Squadron (RADES) at Hill AFB for availability of
        radar data to aid the investigation.
     6.5.4.14. Tab N. Transcripts of Voice Communications. These are written transcripts of recorded
     “Air-to-Ground” or “Aircraft-to-Aircraft” as well as any other voice communications that may aid
     the investigator. Begin the transcript as early in the mishap sequence as is practical and end the
     transcript when all damage and injury has occurred. Long term rescue/SAR transmissions need
     not be included. Because these transcripts are factual data, they often provide a basis for informa-
     tion in the factual summary of circumstances. Do not include actual recordings in Tab N.
        6.5.4.14.1. N1. Cockpit Voice Recording Transcripts. Transcripts of recordings typically from
        Cockpit Voice Recorders
        6.5.4.14.2. N2. Air Traffic Control Transcripts. ATC radio transmissions are recorded by con-
        trol position and frequency. To facilitate expeditious preparation of transcripts, safety investi-
        gators should request transcripts according to which aircraft transmissions, control positions
        or specific frequencies are required. See AFI 13-204, Functional Management of Airfield
        Operations, Chapter 4, for details on obtaining ATC recordings.
        6.5.4.14.3. N3. Command and Control Transcripts. Transcripts of tapes from Command Posts
        and other Command and Control agencies that may aid the investigation.
        6.5.4.14.4. N4. Other available transcripts (e.g., Crash-net, Police etc.).
     6.5.4.15. Tab O. Any Additional Substantiating Data and Reports. This is supporting data not oth-
     erwise defined. It can include local operating instructions (OI), directives, approach and landing
     charts, and other forms. If the SIB cites a brief document (such as a three-page local OI), place it
40                                                  AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005


      within this Tab. Do not mark, highlight, or extract a particular page to show the SIB's exact area of
      interest. (Highlighted pages are placed in Tab V of the Formal Report.) For lengthy documents, it
      is sufficient to show a listing of documents or records reviewed by the SIB and their effective
      dates.
          6.5.4.15.1. Include any TCTOs or TOs in this Tab. However, if the publication is protected
          under the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C.Sec.2751 et seq.) or the Export Adminis-
          tration Act of 1979, as amended (Title 50, U.S.C., App. 2401 et seq.) then contact the OPR to
          ascertain whether the material can be publicly released (i.e. Part 1). If not publicly releasable
          and still required for the report place the information in Tab V as required. Regardless, the
          publication may be released to the AIB. If a TO is not subject to the Arms Export Control Act
          or the Export Administration Act of 1979 or clearance is received from the release authority,
          include the clearance letter or determination of inapplicability with the TO pages in the Part I.
      6.5.4.16. Tab P. Damage and Injury Summaries.
          6.5.4.16.1. P1. Certificate of Damage. This lists the total damage to all government property,
          materiel, and equipment. See AFI 91-204, paragraph 1.9. for damage cost guidelines. Provide
          a detailed statement that includes acquisition, replacement or repair costs (as applicable) for all
          property, material or equipment damaged. Include nomenclature and national stock number
          (NSN) if available. See Table 6.2. for an example.

Table 6.2. Example Certificate of Damage.

          6.5.4.16.2. P2. Statement of Damage to Private Property. Omit if no private property was
          damaged in the mishap. If private property is damaged, the SIB will draft a statement indicat-
          ing the type of property damage involved (e.g. 20' x 30' x 15' deep crater in NW corner of
          property, 5 acres of barley destroyed, etc.) The statement will not contain damage cost esti-
          mates, but only describe the damage incurred. Additionally do not state the cause of the prop-
          erty damage (e.g. 5 acres of barley destroyed by post impact fire). Statement should be no
          more than a brief description of the type and extent of damage to civilian personnel and prop-
          erty.
      6.5.4.17. Tab Q. AIB Transfer Documents. Include a memorandum from the SIB President to the
      AIB President regarding the location and disposition of all involved evidence, wreckage, and
      components involved in the mishap sequence. This includes items sent to an Air Logistics Center
      or other location for analysis.
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                    41


     6.5.4.18. Tab R. Releasable Witness Testimony. Investigators take testimony from all individuals
     involved in the mishap and those who were witnesses to the mishap. Testimony includes both
     written statements and recorded interviews. Place testimony from individuals and witnesses that
     were not granted a promise of confidentiality in this tab. Do not include audio recordings. If a
     promise of confidentiality was offered to an individual, the testimony will be placed in Tab U. See
     AFI 91-204, paragraph 3.2.5. for discussion of promise of confidentiality. All testimony must be
     properly documented stating if a promise of confidentiality has or has not been extended IAW AFI
     91-204, paragraph 3.2.6.2. For non-privileged interviews, read, record, and transcribe the Notice
     to Witness that Recorded Statement is not Confidential (AFI 91-204, Figure A3.5). For non-privi-
     leged written witness statements, include a copy of Memorandum for Non-Privileged Written Wit-
     ness Statements (AFI 91-204, Figure A3.4).
     6.5.4.19. Tab S. Releasable Photographs, Videos and Diagrams.
        6.5.4.19.1. S1. Diagrams. (e.g., Fallout, Impact Area, Route-of-Flight, etc). Ensure diagrams
        are self-explanatory. Include only those diagrams that add to the report. Indicate direction with
        a northward pointing arrow on each diagram. If practical, indicate scale. Ensure the diagrams
        do not depict the location of human remains. Such diagrams should be placed in Part II, to pro-
        tect the privacy interests of the decedent’s family.
        6.5.4.19.2. S2. Releasable Photos. Well-defined photographs help in mishap analysis. Use
        them to show damage, impact areas, metal fractures, flight path, vehicle travel, etc. Use elec-
        tronic copies of photos for reproduction in the formal report. Only include photographs that
        aid the in understanding of the mishap. Do not unnecessarily show evidence of human injury
        (i.e., bloody aircraft parts). If the SIB absolutely needs to disseminate an injury photo to illus-
        trate the mishap, consider using a black and white photo if it will meet the needs of the inves-
        tigation. Photographs of deceased personnel, medical tests and X-rays should be given to the
        AIB, and if they support findings or recommendations, placed in Tab Y of HQ AFSC Copy 1
        (only). Include an index of photographs to aid reviewers. Do not refer to privileged safety
        information on the page captions or in comments on the index. Where applicable, the title
        should include which direction the photograph is facing (ie, Debris field looking to the west).
        Photographs are privileged if they are staged for the board's analysis. Staged photographs are
        privileged and placed in Part II. For example, include pictures of models showing flight paths
        in a midair collision at Tab X. Pointing with a finger or other device at a portion of wreckage
        does not make the photograph staged. Assembling or reconstructing damaged parts or aligning
        parts to show fire patterns or impact marks are examples of staged photographs. Depictions of
        cockpit indications for a given set of assumptions made by the SIB or described in witness tes-
        timony are staged photographs. When investigators include privileged safety information on a
        transparent or electronically drawn overlay, place the photograph with the overlay in Tab X
        and the photograph without the overlay in Tab S.
        6.5.4.19.3. S3. Releasable videos. Include any releasable videos available to the SIB. Include
        CD-ROM copies in Hard-copy formal reports and save as MPEG or other similar file for elec-
        tronic formal reports.

     6.5.5. Part 2. Board Conclusions and Non-releasable Privileged Material.
        6.5.5.1. Tab T. Investigation, Analysis, and Conclusions. This is the most important part of the
        report. It draws on all portions of the report to provide a complete picture of what happened, how
        it happened, and why it happened. It is a thorough analysis of all evidence and the findings,
        causes, and recommendations. This section records the opinions of the SIB, and it either accepts or
        rejects all scenarios or theories in the report. Only in the case of a minority report are there differ-
        ing findings, causes, or recommendations. Reference Figure 6.3.
        Boards need to pay particular attention to four critical aspects of Tab T: assessment of possible
        mishap factors, development of concise findings, assignment of “cause” at the critical points in the
        mishap sequence, and promulgation of well-considered recommendations to prevent recurrence.
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                     43


Figure 6.3. Tab T Outline.
T1. Glossary of Terms and Acronyms.
T2. Executive Summary. The executive summary provides a condensed version of the mishap report
that encapsulates the mishap sequence, analysis, and board’s findings, causes and recommendations. It
should be two or three pages in length.
   T2.1. Mission Overview. A brief description of the planned mission profile or planned maintenance
   actions. Do not describe the mishap sequence or provide analysis of the mishap sequence in this sec-
   tion.
   T2.2. Mishap Crew or Maintenance Personnel Involved. A brief description of the personnel involved
   to include qualifications, recent experience, etc.
   T2.3. Investigation and Analysis. Summarize the key events in the mishap sequence and causal factors
   involved. Do not include Other Finding of Significance discussions.
   T2.4. Findings
   T2.5. Primary Recommendations
T3. Mishap Sequence of Events and Background Information.
   T3.1. Mishap Sequence of Events. A chronological sequence of events in narrative format, detailing
   the events of the mishap. This should include all pertinent events in the sequence to include detailed
   discussions of flight briefing or maintenance brief, ground ops, takeoff, etc. through the mishap
   sequence, search and rescue, and description of the mishap site/location. Time of significant events
   should be integrated in the write-ups. Do not place analysis in this section. Simply describe the “facts”
   of the mishap.
   T3.2. Mishap Chronology. (timeline table)
   T3.3. Background information on those involved in the mishap. Provide background information on
   the mishap crewmembers, maintenance members, leadership members, or others that add to the mis-
   hap. Background information includes but is not limited to information on training, upgrades, promo-
   tions, deployments, 30/60/90 day totals, and summary of 72 hour/14 day histories. Do not place
   analysis in this section. Simply describe the “facts” of the personnel involved in the mishap.
T4. Investigation and Analysis. It is important to remember to not only include what was ruled in and
why with regards to being a factor in the mishap sequence, but what was ruled out and why. Explain the
process used to arrive at the conclusions. If an issue could have “reasonably” been a factor in the mishap
sequence but wasn’t, explain in the appropriate section how the SIB determined it wasn’t a factor. Not all
non-factors need to be discussed. For example, if the SIB is dealing with a gear-up landing and during the
course of the investigation determined that airfield NOTAMs were not an issue, that doesn’t warrant men-
tion in the report. However, given the same gear-up landing, if the SIB determined that recent mainte-
nance performed on the landing gear wasn’t a factor, that deserves discussion on how it was ruled out.
Reference paragraph 6.4.1. for a discussion of factors, non-factors worthy of discussion, and non-factors.
For a formal report’s Tab T, each factor and non-factor worthy of discussion should be analyzed in a sep-
arate write-up. Use an overview, analysis, and conclusion for each factor and non-factor worthy of discus-
sion, as shown below. Non-factors may simply be listed.
44                                                   AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005


      --Overview: Brief discussion of the factor/non-factor worthy of discussion.
     --Analysis: SIB method to determine the factor’s influence on the mishap scenario. Include enough
information so the reader can logically follow the SIB’s rationale for conclusions reached. Should include
references, as appropriate, to specific Technical Orders/Publications, training received, actions accom-
plished, results of technical analysis, etc.
   --Conclusion: Summarize whether the topic was or was not a factor, and if the factor was causal in the
mishap sequence.

T5. Findings and Causes. A chronological list of all the SIB’s findings and causes. Ensure that all find-
ings and causes are supported by the investigation and analysis section. Reference AFI 91-204, para-
graphs 5.9. and 5.10.
T6. Recommendations. A list of all of the SIB’s recommendations. Each recommendation needs to cor-
respond to a finding. Reference AFI 91-204, paragraph 5.11. If an AF 847 or AFTO 22 was completed,
place its tracking number next to the corresponding recommendation.
T7. Other Findings and Recommendations of Significance (OFS/ORS). Reference AFI 91-204, para-
graph 5.12.
T8. Authentication Page. Type each primary SIB member’s name, grade, and position on the last page of
this tab. Have each concurring member, including primary members from other services on joint investi-
gations, sign above it for authentication of the report or for any changes to the report. If the formal SIB
report needs to be changed after it is completed and signed by the board, all primary members of the SIB
will be reconvened.
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                   45


     6.5.5.2. Tab U. Witness Testimony Provided Under a Promise of Confidentiality. Investigators
     take testimony from all individuals involved in the mishap and those who were witnesses to the
     mishap. Testimony includes both written statements and recorded interviews. If a promise of con-
     fidentiality was offered to an individual, the testimony will be placed in this tab. Do not include
     audio recordings. If a promise of confidentiality was not offered place the testimony in Tab R. See
     AFI 91-204, paragraph 3.2.5. for a discussion of promise of confidentiality. Testimony must be
     properly documented stating if a promise of confidentiality has or has not been extended IAW AFI
     91-204, paragraph 3.2.6.2.
        6.5.5.2.1. Transcripts of complete interviews must contain the advisory in AFI 91-204, Figure
        A3.3. In cases where witness testimony is summarized by the interviewer, it must be clear that
        the witness was advised of and understood this advisory. For privileged written witness state-
        ments, include a signed copy of the Memorandum Documenting Promise of Confidentiality
        for Written Witness Statements in AFI 91-204, Figure A3.2.
        6.5.5.2.2. Select only meaningful testimony to include in this tab. It is not necessary to pub-
        lish all testimony. Place the statements and transcribed interviews of each individual together
        in chronological order with the earliest on top to make it easier to compare the individual’s
        impressions. The mishap crewmembers are placed first followed by other witnesses. Consider
        all statements and testimony included at this tab in the analysis at Tab T.
     6.5.5.3. Tab V. Other Supporting Privileged Products. These are supporting privileged products
     not otherwise defined.
        6.5.5.3.1. V1. Applicable portions of publications. Whenever findings or recommendations
        involve deficiencies in or changes to technical orders, flight manuals, checklists, or directives,
        include applicable portions of the original publications in this tab. The SIB's conclusion that a
        particular paragraph of a document was or was not a mishap factor is privileged. Place high-
        lighted pages or publication extracts revealing the deliberative process of the board in this tab.
        6.5.5.3.2. V2. AF Forms 22 or AFTO Forms 847. Include copies of SIB submitted AFTO
        Form 22s, (Technical Manual Change Recommendation and Reply) or AF Form 847s, (Rec-
        ommendation for Change of Publication), in this tab. Investigators will obtain a tracking num-
        ber for submitted Forms 22 or 847 from the unit QA or MAJCOM Standardization and
        Evaluation office, as applicable. Place the tracking number and the mishap’s AFSAS number
        on the submitted Forms 22 or 847 to ensure these recommendations receive the appropriate
        levels of review.
        6.5.5.3.3. V3. Status Messages Transmitted by the SIB. Include copies of any status messages
        transmitted by the SIB in this tab.
        6.5.5.3.4. V4. SIB Surveys. Include copies of any surveys conducted by the SIB to aid their
        investigation. Reference AFPAM 91-211 for a survey example and information. Coordinate

                                                 Chapter 7

                                        FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS

7.1. Overview. Follow-up actions consist of reviewing the results of an investigation and acting upon its
recommendations. Reference AFI 91-204 for requirements to accomplish the review of recommenda-
tions. Reference Figure 7.1. for submission of Final Review comments.

7.2. Acting upon Recommendations.
     7.2.1. Evaluating MOFE Recommendations. OPRs are expected to use risk management principles
     during the evaluation. For formal report recommendations, formal risk assessments are required. Risk
     assessments must consider the identified hazard and associated risk (as identified by the safety inves-
     tigation and corrected as necessary by the OPRs and OCRs), the associated costs, benefits, schedule to
     implement, and residual risk assuming recommendation implementation. These assessments are then
     used for decision-making and at the MAJCOM level for the purpose of prioritizing open recommen-
     dations. Refer to AFI 90-901, Operational Risk Management, and AFPAM 90-902, Operational Risk
     Management (ORM) Guidelines and Tools, for information on appropriate risk management concepts,
     principles, and processes.
     7.2.2. Reporting Recommendation Progress.
        7.2.2.1. The OPRs and OCRs or their designee will document their progress on all recommenda-
        tions and other recommendations of significance using AFSAS. Reporting must occur at least
        once every six months until the recommendation is closed. Updates may include actions planned
        or taken, results of development/testing, delays experienced, brief rationale for decisions made,
        and concurrence or non-concurrence by other agencies.
        7.2.2.2. If action is transferred to another OPR or OCR, coordinate the transfer in advance and
        mutually agree on the action. The last status update from the losing OPR or OCR will state the
        transfer effective date and will identify the gaining OPR or OCR.
     7.2.3. Recommendation Reviews
        7.2.3.1. MAJCOM/DRU/FOAs/ANG will establish a Mishap Review Panel (MRP) or equivalent
        process (eg., Material Safety Task Group) to ensure mishap recommendations are methodically
        addressed. The MRP or similar process will meet once every six months. The reports will be com-
        piled using data as of 30 Sep and 30 Mar each year (end of FY and end of second quarter). A con-
        solidated recommendation status report is due to HQ AFSC on 15 Nov and 15 May every year.
        This semiannual status report is a way of ensuring these responsibilities are completed. It also
        advises all parties of the status of open recommendations. At a minimum, the semi-annual reports
        will include:
            7.2.3.1.1. Total number of recommendations open at the last review
            7.2.3.1.2. Number of recommendations opened since the last review
            7.2.3.1.3. Number of recommendations closed since the last review
            7.2.3.1.4. Number of recommendations transferred to and received from another MAJCOM
            since the last review

        7.2.3.1.5. Total number of open recommendations now
        7.2.3.1.6. A tabular listing of all closed recommendations including MDS, mishap date and
        recommendation number
        7.2.3.1.7. A tabular listing of all open recommendations including MDS, mishap date, recom-
        mendation number, and a short statement of status (e.g., just opened, on-track, moderate
        issues, significant issues, awaiting funds, closed, etc.).
        7.2.3.1.8. A listing of the MAJCOM’s Top Three recommendations. For each of these recom-
        mendations, include risk management information, and any other supporting documentation,
        to help with the implementation of these recommendations. If necessary, include a brief expla-
        nation of the methodology used to arrive at the Top Three recommendations.
        7.2.3.1.9. AFMC tracks and reports the status of its open recommendations in the DB-10 data-
        base. AFMC will also enter the status of its open recommendations into AFSAS, IAW para-
        graph 7.2.2.1.
     7.2.3.2. AFSC/SEF manages the final disposition of all aviation Class A and B recommendations
     and other recommendations of significance (ORS). Reference AFI 91-204 paragraph 7.5.

Terms
AERO CLUB AIRCRAFT—These are all aircraft assigned to the respective Aero Club. The Aero Club
through, purchase, lease, or loan from the government may have acquired these aircraft. Aero Clubs are
authorized excess DOD and General Service Administration (GSA) aircraft on a loan basis.
AEROSPACE VEHICLES—DOD aircraft, UAVs, missiles, and space vehicles.
AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MISHAP—Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and reportable damage
to a DOD aircraft. Explosives and chemical agents or guided missile mishaps that cause damage in excess
of $20,000 to a DOD aircraft with intent for flight are categorized as aircraft flight mishaps to avoid dual
reporting. This is the only aviation mishap subcategory that contributes to the flight mishap rate.
AIRCRAFT FLIGHT-RELATED MISHAP—Any mishap in which there is intent for flight and no
reportable damage to the DOD aircraft itself, but the mishap involves a fatality, reportable injury, or
reportable property damage. A missile or UAV that is launched from a DOD aircraft, departs without
damaging the aircraft, and is subsequently involved in a DOD mishap is reportable as a guided missile
mishap or UAV, respectively.
AIRCRAFT GROUND OPERATIONS MISHAP—Any mishap in which there is no intent for flight
and which results in damage to a DOD aircraft, a fatality, reportable injury, or reportable property
damage. Damage to an aircraft when it is being handled as cargo or as aircraft components when not
attached to the airframe is a ground and industrial, industrial aviation mishap.
AVIATION MISHAP—An Air Force mishap involving a DOD aircraft or DOD UAV.
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AIRCRAFT—All manned weight-carrying devices supported in
flight by buoyancy or dynamic action and are owned or leased by the DOD Components (including
Reserve forces and National Guard) that are, as follows: operated and exclusively controlled or directed
by a DOD Component; furnished by the Government, loaned, or on bailment to a non-DOD organization
for modification, maintenance, repair, test, contractor training, or experimental project for a DOD
Component, when the Government has assumed ground and flight risk. Includes aircraft under test by a
DOD Component. (This includes aircraft furnished by a contractor or another Government Agency when
operated by a DOD aircrew in official status and a DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving
Report, has been executed to certify that the Department of Defense has accepted the aircraft.) Excludes
54                                                   AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005


aircraft leased, on bailment, or loaned to contractors, commercial airlines, other Government Agencies, or
foreign governments, when the lessee has assumed risk of loss. Excludes civil aircraft owned by civil
operators and accomplishing contract air missions for the DOD Components. Excludes factory-new
production aircraft until successful completion of the post-production acceptance flight (mishaps that
involve such aircraft are reported as contractor mishaps). Excludes flying club aircraft or privately owned
aircraft on DOD installations.
DESTROYED AIRCRAFT/UAV—Aircraft/UAV will be considered destroyed when the man-hours
required to repair the aircraft/UAV exceed the maximum stated in the "major repair man-hours" column
of TO 1-1-638, Repair and Disposal of Aerospace Vehicles. A damaged aircraft/UAV not repaired is not
automatically a "destroyed" aircraft/UAV. The decision not to return a damaged aircraft/UAV to service is
independent of the mishap class. When the aircraft/UAV will not be returned to service, classify the
mishap damage according to the total estimated repair cost as if it had been returned to service. The SIB
must submit detailed repair cost estimates through MAJCOM channels to HQ AFSC/SEF for validation if
an aircraft/UAV will not be returned to service but is not considered destroyed.
EJECTION ATTEMPT—Completion of the action by the aircrew to initiate the ejection system,
regardless of the outcome. For single motion systems, this only requires pulling the handle. For dual
motion systems, both raising the sidearm and squeezing the trigger must be accomplished.
EJECTION SYSTEM—A mechanical device designed to forcefully separate the crew from the aircraft
and return them to the earth’s surface. Examples are an ejection seat, and extraction system, or a crew
module.
ENGINE-CONFINED MISHAP—Applies when an aircraft or UAV turbine engine experiences
reportable damage ($20,000 or more), and damage is confined to the engine and integral engine
components. Damage is considered confined to the engine if there is less than $20,000 damage external to
the engine. If the total cost of all damage external to the engine exceeds $20,000, then the mishap is not
Engine-Confined, regardless of the comparative extent of engine damage cost.
ENGINE FOD MISHAP—When objects external to the engine cause damage, the mishap is an Engine
FOD mishap. When the damage is caused by an internal engine failure (including liberation of internal
engine components such as bolts, rivets, bonded coatings, blades, vanes, abradable coatings, honeycomb
seals, etc.), the mishap is not an Engine FOD mishap.
EVENT—An unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that does not meet the reporting criteria of
a mishap.
HIGH ACCIDENT POTENTIAL (HAP) EVENT—Any hazardous occurrence that has a high
potential for becoming a mishap that does not fit the definition of a HATR.
IN-FLIGHT SHUTDOWN (IFSD)—Any engine shutdown in-flight, either due to an engine
malfunction or by the aircrew following flight manual procedures.
INTENT FOR FLIGHT—Intent for flight is considered to exist when aircraft/UAV brakes are released
and/or takeoff power is applied for commencing an authorized flight. Intent for flight continues until
either the fixed-wing aircraft/UAV taxies clear of the runway or, for helicopters and/or vertical takeoff and
landing aircraft, the aircraft has alighted and the aircraft weight is supported by the landing gear. Clear of
the runway means the entire aircraft/UAV is physically off the active runway. Hover taxi is considered
flight.
MISHAP—A mishap is an unplanned occurrence, or series of occurrences, that results in damage or
AFMAN91-223_AMCSUP1_I 1 OCTOBER 2005                                                                       55


injury and meets Class A, B, C, or D mishap reporting criteria IAW paragraph 1.8. Damage or injury
includes: damage to DOD property; occupational illness to DOD military or civilian personnel; injury to
DOD military personnel on- or off-duty; injury to on-duty DOD civilian personnel; damage to public or
private property, or injury or illness to non-DOD personnel caused by Air Force operations.
MISHAP COSTS—Direct mishap costs ONLY include property damage costs (DOD and Non-DOD)
and environmental cleanup costs.
NON-ACCEPTED EQUIPMENT/VEHICLES—Non-delivered equipment/vehicles for which the
Government has assumed responsibility; DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, HAS
NOT been executed.
NON-RECOVERABLE IN-FLIGHT SHUTDOWN—Any engine shutdown in-flight, either due to an
engine malfunction or by the aircrew following flight manual procedures whereby: the engine is unable to
restart, or further investigation determines that a restart attempt would not have been successful, or further
investigation determines that continued operation would have caused the engine to fail, or the aircraft
cannot maintain level flight at a safe altitude as determined by the situation.
SAFETY INVESTIGATOR—An individual authorized and qualified to investigate a safety occurrence.
Examples include members of an ISB or SIB, an SIO, and members of a safety staff.
SAFETY REPORT—Safety reports include message reports (preliminary, status, and final), formal
reports, and injury and occupational illness forms and logs.
SINGLE MANAGER—The single individual specifically designated, under the integrated weapon
system management architecture, to be responsible for the life cycle management of a system or end-item.
The Single Manager is the program manager vested with full authority, responsibility, and resources to
execute and support an approved Air Force program. A list of the Single Manager organizations and
MDSs is available at:
http://afsafety.af.mil/AFSC/RDBMS/Flight/SIB-Support/Formal%20Report%20Files/
TableA31andMDSLists.xls
UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV)—All unmanned DOD weight-carrying devices supported in
flight by buoyancy or dynamic action and are owned or leased by the DOD Components, including
aerostat balloons, that are, as follows: operated and exclusively controlled or directed by a DOD
Component; furnished by the Government or on bailment to a non-DOD organization for modification,
maintenance, repair, test, contract training, or experimental project for a DOD Component, when the
Government has assumed ground and flight risk; under test by a DOD Component. (This includes UAVs
furnished by a contractor or another Government Agency when operated by a DOD crew in official status
and a DD Form 250, Material Inspection and Receiving Report, has been executed to certify that the
DOD has accepted the vehicle.) UAVs covered by this instruction include, but are not limited to, the
following: Tactical UAVs, such as the RQ-1 Predator or RQ-4 Global Hawk; Full Scale Aerial Target
Remotely Piloted Vehicles (FSAT RPVs), such as the QF-4; Subscale RPVs, such as the BQM-34 Firebee
or MQM-107 Streaker; Buoyant UAVs, such as a tethered aerostat; Remotely Operated Aircraft (ROA),
and Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAV). When an FSAT RPV is carrying a person, it is a DOD
aircraft, not a UAV.

UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE MISHAP—Any mishap involving a DOD UAV as defined in this
instruction, but not involving a DOD aircraft. Damage to a DOD UAV, when it is being handled as a
commodity or cargo, is a ground and industrial, industrial aviation mishap. See AFI 99-151,
Air-Launched Missile Analysis Group (ALMAG), for additional guidance on investigating specific types
of air-launched missile anomalies and failures.

        them to HQ AFSC/JA for forwarding.
     3. For all mishaps requiring an action by an AFMC organization, send one electronic copy to HQ
        AFMC/SE, Wright Patterson AFB OH 45433-5006, as well as the tasked agency.
     4. When routing formal reports to Air Logistics Centers, SPD, or product center send the reports to
        the Materiel Safety Offices at the applicable ALC for internal distribution and tracking (if applica-
        ble). Use the following addresses:
        a. OC-ALC/PSRP Tinker AFB OK 73145-3005
        b. OO-ALC/SES Hill AFB UT 84056-5003
