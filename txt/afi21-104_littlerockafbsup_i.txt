This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space Maintenance. It directs the management
of selected gas turbine engines identified in technical order (T.O.) 00-25-254-1, the
Comprehensive Engine Management System Engine Configuration Status and TCTO Reporting
Procedures. This AFI describes the propulsion management responsibilities required to manage
Air Force engines. The Air Force manages selected gas turbine engines (hereafter referred to as
―engines‖) as principal items, as defined by Regulation 4140.1-R, DoD Supply Chain Material
Management Regulation, 23 May 2003. Being principal items, engines require special
centralized management, including inventory control, computation of requirements, distribution,
and information systems. The justification for these systems includes safety and reliability
considerations which have a direct impact on successful mission completion, limited available
assets, and high acquisition and logistics support costs. The Air Force serially manages and
controls engines throughout their lifetime, cradle to grave, using technical order 00-25-254-1.
USAF engines are purchased under the ―        Life-of-Type Buy‖ concept, which means that
procurement of engines after the acquisition program has ended is generally not economically
feasible per DOD 4140.1-R. Thus, only finite quantities of engines are available to support the
aircraft in which they are installed for their operational life. This instruction also provides

guidance and assigns responsibility for managing the Air Force Engine Trending and Diagnostics
Program (ET&D). Technical Order 00-25-257 outlines the technical aspects of ET&D. Related
policies include AFI 21-124, Oil Analysis Program. This instruction applies to all major
commands (MAJCOMs), including the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). This publication
does not apply to the Air National Guard (ANG). Waiver authority for this instruction is
AF/A4M. MAJCOMs must coordinate any supplementing Command instructions with AF/A4M

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. It eliminates the role of
Propulsion Product Group Manager and redistributes corresponding position responsibilities to
the Director of Propulsion and the Single Managers under a reorganized USAF structure.
Attachment 4, Engine Health Indicators, of this AFI supersedes PPGM OI 20-104, PPGM OI 21-
102 and previous attachment 5. Chapter 5 has been revised to include requirements of AFI 21-
132, AF Engine Trending and Diagnostics Program.

(LITTLEROCKAFB) Supplement has been revised to reflect date of new basic publication,
reflect office symbol changes incurred from transfer of base from AETC to AMC and requires
formal notification of aircraft transferring to and from a PDM location.

                                   ENGINE MANAGEMENT

3.1. Engine Asset Management. SRAN engine managers input CEMS data by serial numbers
according to T.O. 00-25-254-1 for all accountable and non-accountable tracked items. SRAN
and MAJCOM engine managers use this data to evaluate the health of engines in individual
accounts and to predict removals, repair and spare engines. The Propulsion SMs, engineers,
actuaries, engine managers, and item managers use this data to help manage the engines, predict
requirements (for acquisition, distribution, repair, and retention), maintain repair facilities, and
manage spare parts to repair engines and components.
     3.1.1. Whole Engine Repair Enterprise Network will be implemented using the Repair
     Enterprise for the 21st century (RE21) concept which utilizes centralized management of all
     like item repair functions, maximizing synergistic benefits and focuses on increasing the
     velocity of the repair and distribution process to satisfy pipeline requirements.
        3.1.1.1. Logistics Support Center (LSC) C2 Cell: The LSC C2 Cell will provide
        prioritization, induction, and distribution of RE21 assets in the repair enterprise and
        transportation pipelines. This cell will be responsible for coordinating repair actions with
        supported command functional managers and SOR to ensure a common understanding of
        current priorities and asset status. The cell will use established guidance in Chapter 6,
        Centralized Intermediate Repair Facility for Engines, to manage requirements and
        oversee daily operations.
3.2. Whole Engine Accountability. This instruction identifies accountability requirements for
whole engines and selected critical engine parts. The Air Force uses the standard supply system
to account for critical engine parts.
     3.2.1. Engine SRANs: The Propulsion SM manages all engines identified in Master SRAN
     FJ2031. SRAN EJXXXX or FJXXXX (as specified in TO 00-25-254-1) is a sub account to
     SRAN FJ2031 and provides accountability for engines. Activities possessing CEMS
     accountable engines require a SRAN. Air Force, AFRC, and ANG activities are FJXXXX
     SRANs. Contractors and inter-service support activities are EJXXXX SRANs. Procedures
     for obtaining or deleting SRANs are in TO 00-25-254-1.
3.3. Engine Life-cycle Management Plans (ELMP):
     3.3.1. Propulsion SMs are responsible for assuring each of their TMS engines currently
     active in the USAF inventory, excluding missile (e.g. Air Ground Missile (AGM)) and drone
     engines, will have an ELMP updated and on file. The ELMP is a living, dynamic,
     documented strategy to ensure the operational safety, suitability and effectiveness (OSS&E)
     goals are established, in coordination with operating MAJCOMS, and achieved throughout
     the life cycle of the engine at an affordable cost.
     3.3.2. Each engine system is different and the individual ELMP will vary depending on life
     cycle progress. However, the general format and content of each ELMP is defined by the
     DoP.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                      17



3.4. Whole Engine Requirements.
   3.4.1. Propulsion Requirements System (PRS): The Air Force uses PRS to compute whole
   engine requirements. Chapter 7 details the whole engine requirements process.
3.5. Engine Manufacturers Warranty Program: (Consider warranties for each new TMS
engine acquisition). Warranties must be easily understandable, enforceable, affordable, and not
disrupt existing procedures for logistics support or data systems, nor require extensive new data
systems to administer.
3.6. Engine Repair and Overhaul Requirements: Propulsion SMs, Engine Item Managers
(EIM) and MAJCOMs forecast engine repair and overhaul requirements prior to periodic
negotiations with engine depots. Procedures and models are established to forecast requirements
to support the stock level policy, special projects, security assistance programs support, and
consolidate worldwide engine repair and overhaul requirements. Compute repair and overhaul
requirements in accordance with Chapter 7.
3.7. Retention, Reclamation, and Disposal: Propulsion SMs are directed to use AFI 23-501,
Retaining and Transferring Materiel, as it identifies requirements for retention of spare engines.
Reclamations are excess to Air Force, other services, and FMS system support needs. The only
exception is for engines on the save list of donated aircraft and missiles (see AFMAN 23-110,

                        ENGINE TRENDING AND DIAGNOSTICS

5.1. General: Engine Trending and Diagnostics (ET&D) is a program integrating hardware,
software, technical documents, training, maintenance, and diagnostic/prognostic processes to
quantify and monitor/manage engine health. Effective use of ET&D can reduce engine flight
safety risk, improve reliability, and optimize life cycle costs. The purpose of ET&D is to:
   5.1.1. Predict, detect and conduct pre-emptive analysis of adverse trends.
   5.1.2. Forecast time and material requirements days or weeks in advance to optimize
   Engines Not Mission Capable Supply (ENMCS) rates and maintenance man-hours.
       5.1.2.1. Logistics center, product center and OEM engineers and technicians use ET&D
       to develop engine trend algorithms and provide support to field users by diagnosing
       engine performance problems. When requested, depot and product center engineers and
       technicians use ET&D to determine engine operational parameters in support of mishap
       investigations.
   5.1.3. Ensure all reportable deficiencies on engines hardware and software covered by this
   AFI shall be documented, reported, and resolved in accordance with TO 00-35D-54.
   5.1.4. Reduce established shop flow days and serviceable spare engine levels to meet
   customer requirements and funding.
   5.1.5. Reduce life cycle costs and optimize reliability by improved measurement of life used
   on critical Components.
   5.1.6. Improve established customer reliability by phasing out time-based removals and
   increasing ATOW or MTBR.
5.2. Program Participation:
   5.2.1. The ET & D Working Group (ET&D WG) is the principle organization to develop
   implementation plans, identify technological opportunities related to Engine Health
   Management, initiate technical order support for all ET&D processes and procedures and
   provide for personnel training, among other responsibilities.
       5.2.1.1. The ET&D WG is composed of the following membership: Senior Leader for
       Propulsion, AFRL representative, DoP representative, Chief Engineer from Development
       and Sustainment Groups, ET&D Program Manager, Propulsion National Security System
       (NSS) Software Program Manager, Major Command Logistics Liaison Officers,
       Sustainment Group Lead Engineers, Technicians, TMS Managers, Propulsion Organic
       Software Support Engineering, Maintenance Engineering, International United States Air
       Force Representative/s and Aircraft SPM’s flight data recorder representatives.
5.3. Program Goal: The primary goal of the ET&D program is to prevent or limit damage to
turbine engines by prediction or early detection of performance degradation and/or failures. This
is done by monitoring engine operating parameters, engine wear-metal analysis, visual
inspections, and comparison to engine maintenance records data. Enhancements may include
comparison of installed engine performance to that of a model serving as a base line.

6.1. General Policy. Centralized Intermediate Repair Facilities (CIRF) are designed to take
advantage of existing repair centers to sustain in garrison or deployed forces, which are
congruent with AF Vision 2020 doctrine to reduce the forward support footprint. The CIRF
provides a consistent regional repair support during steady-state or contingency operations. A
CIRF may be theater-based (OCONUS) or steady-state (CONUS). Engine requirements for
CIRFs will be calculated using the PRS and allocated annually.
6.2. Centralized Engine Rotable Pool (CERP). A CERP will be established and maintained at
all CIRF locations. CERP management, control and procedures may vary depending on specific
logistic characteristics of engine type and type aircraft. The designated engine manager will
maintain accountability of CERP engines and report status.
   6.2.1. Command and Control. The command and control of CIRF engine pools resides
   with both the CIRF supporting CEM appointed by the CIRF supporting MAJCOM A4 and
   LSC C2 Cell appointed by the CIRF supporting LSC/CC.
       6.2.1.1. The CIRF supporting LSC C2 Cell will designate a supply and transportation
       point of contact to assist the CIRF engine manger in supply and transportation CIRF
       issues.
       6.2.1.2. All MAJCOMs using the CIRF will assign an engine manager to interact with
       both the CIRF supporting CEM and LSC C2 Cell.
       6.2.1.3. Separate SRANs will be established for each CIRF location.
   6.2.2. CERP Management. The dynamic global environment and engine type will dictate
   where and what type of centralized rotable engine spares pools should be established. The
   extent to which rotable engine pools are used lies with the combatant command that may task
   a supporting command to provide CIRF capabilities and additional commands to provide
   assets (engines, personnel and equipment) to the centralized rotable engine pools. Once valid
   requirements are established, the CIRF supporting CEM and LSC C2 Cell will manage and
   control all engine types assigned to their respective engine pools.
   6.2.3. Final Authority. In the instance of contingency tasked forces, the combatant
   command A4 has final authority on whether to send a CERP engine to a contingency
   location. The CIRF supporting—command A4 will work with the combatant command A4
   Logistics Readiness Center to ensure mission requirements are met.
       6.2.3.1. The supporting CIRF activity will receive additional engines to populate the
       rotable engine pool from supporting Combat Air Forces (CAFs) or Mobility Air Forces
       (MAFs) based on requirements provided by the CIRF supporting command and approved
       by the combatant command. From these requirements, the supporting activity will
       calculate the number of spares required to support the operation. Deliberate planning is
       required and should entail consideration for the entire repair cycle.
       6.2.3.2. Established rotable spare engine pool locations may be expanded or shifted from
       one theater to another based on need.

        6.2.3.3. During steady state operation it is possible that maintenance, beyond the
        capability of the CIRF, is required on CIRF tasked engines. When this occurs, the CIRF
        supporting—CEM and LSC C2 Cell will coordinate with applicable MAJCOM’s to
        develop a course of action for repair.
6.3. Reliability Centered Maintenance. Each CIRF location will implement RCM for each
CIRF repairable engine based on supportability (deployed units mission needs/time involved)
and parts availability. CIRF Propulsion Flight Chief and Engine Management will determine the
best maintenance plan for each repairable engine, to include TCTOs and coordinate with LSC C2
Cell and MAJCOM CEM as necessary.
6.4. Logistics Support Center (LSC) C2 Cell Prioritization, Induction, and Distribution of
CIRF assets: The CIRF concept requires a robust command and control architecture and
processes to prioritize, induct, and distribute CIRF-repaired assets to supported units. Specific
CIRF Operational level C2 decisions include:
     6.4.1. Managing and prioritizing CIRF activities based on established weapon system goals
     (e.g., spare levels, etc…) for CIRF-supported units.
     6.4.2. Allocating serviceable assets to the CIRF Centralized Engine Rotable Pool (CERP)
     and CIRF-supported units.
     6.4.3. Coordinating and tracking movement of assets between supported units and the CIRF,
     to include reparables, repaired parts, cannibalized parts, time change items, TCTO kits,
     etc….
     6.4.4. Integrating depot repair production with CIRF repair capability.
     6.4.5. Coordinating retrograde and sustainment actions with other MAJCOM or Combatant
     Command Mission Support Teams, Item Managers or Depot.
     6.4.6. Monitoring production at each CIRF location.
     6.4.7. Coordinating special transportation requirements between CIRF FSL and supported
     unit FOLs (e.g., diplomatic clearance, transportation mode, timeline, etc…)
6.5. LSC C2 Cell Decision Authority.
     6.5.1. Unless otherwise specified in CIRF governing instructions, serviceable assets will be
     distributed in the following priority order: Units engaged in combat operations, units
     engaged in homeland defense, units engaged in other JCS project-coded operations, units
     within window to deploy for an AEF rotation, all other units.
     6.5.2. Serviceable assets produced at in-theater CIRFs will generally be held for theater use
     by supported units unless a higher priority demand exist, as indicated above or in the CIRF
     governing instruction. GLSC will determine fulfillment of out-of-theater demand (i.e. lateral
     support) and assure coordination among the gaining and loosing MAJCOM CEMs.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                   29


  6.5.3. The supported command retains final authority on asset distribution to their assigned
  and attached units. In the event of a dispute between two or more combatant command A4
  Liaison Elements supported by the same LSC, HAF CSC may provide resolution.
  6.5.4. Provide equitable distribution of ― high time‖ assets. High time serviceable assets have
  limited service life remaining until the next major inspection, maintenance or overhaul. High
  time assets impact maintenance planning by introducing turbulence and un-forecasted
  requirements into maintenance schedules. Units submitting reparables with ―          low time‖
  should not repeatedly receive back ―   high time‖ assets. The goal of the LSC C2 Cell should
  be to minimize induced disruption to maintenance plans and schedules. Where not possible,
  the distribution of high time assets across supported units should be equitable.

               WHOLE ENGINE SPARE REQUIREMENTS COMPUTATION

7.1. General Policy. Whole spare engine requirements computations establish acquisition and
distribution of spare engine levels. The acquisition computation establishes the quantity of whole
spare engines the Air Force needs to buy to support the weapons system until retirement. The
distribution computation establishes the quantity and locations where the Air Force will place its
spare engines based on current planning policy and engine reliability. In addition, other
computations are accomplished for repair and retention requirements. The Air Force standard
system used for the computation of whole spare engine requirements is PRS (D087Q).
     7.1.1. Documentation. Adequate supporting documentation must be maintained for the
     whole spare engine requirements computations to establish an effective system of
     management controls. This includes documentation to support assumptions made, verify the
     accuracy of data used, validate the currency/applicability of data, identify data (factor)
     changes and trends, and re-create the requirements computation if required. The PRS
     functional manager will document all sources used and pertinent assumptions made during
     the computation of whole spare engine requirements. Supporting documentation will be in
     written form (e.g., letter, e-mail, MFR, etc.), and retained with the computation results for the
     required time period per the following retention matrix.

Table 7.1. Engine Documentation Retention Matrix.

     7.1.2. Roles and Responsibilities.
        7.1.2.1. AF/A4M: Provides oversight and policy for the management of AF engines
        including the PRS computation process.
        7.1.2.2. AF/A8P: Sends latest version of the USAF Program Aerospace Vehicles and
        Flying Hours (PA) file to 754 ELSG/LRW after submission of each PB. Format the PA
        and D087Q according to the MOA between AF/A8PE and 754 ELSG/LRW. Publish the
        latest version of both the PA Documents, Volumes I and II, on the SIPRNET following
        the submission
        7.1.2.3. USAF/A5X: Makes available the most current version of the Requirements
        Daily Answer Tape (RDAT) to 754 ELSG/LRW after completion of the President’s
        Budget each year, due NLT 1 February. Format War Mobilization Plan (WMP) 3&5 and
        D087 according to the memorandum of agreement (MOA) between AF/A5XW and 754
        ELSG/LRW in support of the distribution computation.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                31


     7.1.2.4. 754 ELSG/LRW: The Air Force program manager for PRS is 754 ELSG/LRW
     (WSMIS Program Office). Loads appropriate input data into the PRS database. Sends
     copies of the PA and RDAT to MAJCOM CEMs, PRS, FM, and SMs after formatting for
     input into PRS in support of the distribution computation
     7.1.2.5. Director of Propulsion: The Air Force functional manager for PRS. He assures
     computation policies established by AF/A4M are complied with, audits accuracy of the
     computation, and initiates and monitors the process and manages the schedule for the
     spare whole engine distribution computation, as required, at least annually. If updated
     flying hour data is unavailable, he notifies MAJCOMs and Propulsion SMs which
     document is available to use for annual distribution computations. He oversees the proper
     documentation of whole engine computation model software, PRS logic, and processes.
     7.1.2.6. MAJCOM CEM: Reviews and coordinates all computation                      inputs.
     Accomplishes the individual MAJCOM distribution computations.
     7.1.2.7. Propulsion SM: Accomplishes spare whole engine stock level acquisition
     computations and roll-up spare whole engine stock level distribution computations for the
     TMS engines they manage. Forecasts actuarial removal intervals for use in the whole
     engine stock level distribution and overhaul computations.
     7.1.2.8. Acquisition Engine Review Organization (ERO):
        7.1.2.8.1. Purpose. The primary purpose of having an Acquisition ERO is to collect,
        develop, and coordinate factors used in the spare engine requirements acquisition /
        distribution computations for engines still in production.
        7.1.2.8.2. Membership. The chairperson of the ERO will be the Propulsion SM
        Chief/Lead Engineer. Other members of the ERO include designee’s from the using
        MAJCOMs, SM’s TMS Program Management Team and OEM, as appropriate.
        7.1.2.8.3. Responsibilities. The ERO is responsible for insuring that factors used in
        spare engine acquisition and distribution computations are current and complete.
        7.1.2.8.4. Frequency. The chairperson will call an ERO meeting, depending on the
        changes the engine has experienced in such areas as operational deployment,
        maintenance     concepts,    reliability  and     maintainability  trends, major
        modification/configuration changes, and general logistics support.
        7.1.2.8.5. Minutes. Minutes will be kept by the chairperson and will include an
        attendee list, a copy of the agenda, briefings presented, documentation clearly
        specifying decisions reached, and an action item summary. Minutes will be provided
        to each attendee, the Propulsion SM, and DoP.
        7.1.2.8.6. Factors. Factors will be developed to reflect the transition from peace to
        surge to sustained war. The chairperson of the ERO will determine the need to
        develop mature or actual factors, or both. The peace, surge, and sustained war factors
        that fall under the ERO responsibility are; Shop Visit Rate (SVR), Not Reparable
        This Station (NRTS), and Pipeline Times as provided by the MPWG, to include Base
        Repair In Work Times and Depot Repair In Work Times
            7.1.2.8.6.1. Although transportation times are not developed by the ERO,
            transportation standards should be reviewed because of their significant impact on
32                           AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010


        spare engine requirements. Questions that arise concerning transportation
        standards should be passed to the Propulsion SM’s office for review and action.
        7.1.2.8.6.2. Within each type factor, values are required for three time frames:
        peacetime, war surge, and war sustained. Factors are established from data
        analysis supported by documented assumptions and rationale. The sustained
        values may be the same as the peacetime values when data are not available.
        Maintain permanent documentation of supporting data, rationale, assumptions,
        and decisions as an appendix to the ERO meeting minutes. Decisions without
        supporting data must be fully explained in the documentation.
        7.1.2.8.6.3. Mathematical modeling and computer simulation are used to develop
        factors whenever practical.
        7.1.2.8.6.4. The factors are developed using the assumptions that engines have a
        zero wear out rate and that all unserviceable spare engines are capable of being
        repaired.
        7.1.2.8.6.5. Engine factor changes are approved for use in requirements
        calculations when coordination has been obtained from the Lead Command and
        the Propulsion SM.
        7.1.2.8.6.6. Review factors at least annually and update as necessary.
        7.1.2.8.6.7. Release engine factors on any manufacturer’s engine to another
        manufacturer only with OEM concurrence.
        7.1.2.8.6.8. Consider using the official factors for engine acquisition programs
        when there is significant military or commercial performance and reliability
        experience.
        7.1.2.8.6.9. Develop factors for the TMSM or combined TMSM at either
        worldwide or command level due to mission, operation, support differences, or
        requirements calculations methods.
        7.1.2.8.6.10. Develop estimated repair pipeline times for the engine to flow
        through each segment of the pipeline per T.O. 2-1-18 guidance. This is the
        average time to accomplish all necessary pipeline processes. Elements are
        frequency of occurrence, required manpower, facilities, tools, equipment, parts
        and technical data. Standard pipeline times for mature engine TMS are
        documented in T.O. 2-1-18. Standard pipeline times serve as a goal for each
        maintenance, transportation and supply activity to achieve and should not
        consider delays for induction to maintenance and supply.
     7.1.2.8.7. Maturity. Spare engine computations representing maturity will use
     standard pipeline times and a mature SVR. The SVR will reflect the point in the
     engine’s life cycle when only small changes are expected to occur in the slope of the
     unscheduled engine removal rate curve per flying hour. Scheduled engine removals
     (SER) will be evaluated to determine if there is a stable slope, or if ―   peaks and
     valleys‖ exist. If a stable SER exists, that value will be used in the computation.
     Where ―  peaks and valleys‖ are expected to exist, the EPM will make a recommended
     buy decision after considering the impact at points such as 1) the peak SER value, 2)
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                33


        the minimum SER value and 3) selected mid-range values between the peak and
        minimum.
        7.1.2.8.8. Interfaces. Other sanctioned groups exist that also review and develop
        factors needed to operate PRS. Groups such as the Engine Advisory Board, Senior
        Steering Groups, Maintenance Planning Working Group, Readiness Working Groups
        and Source Selection Teams may also be charged with developing official factors that
        can be used to compute spare engines. It is permissible for the factors developed by
        an officially sanctioned group to be incorporated into spare engine computations with
        approval of the ERO.
     7.1.2.9. Aerospace Engine Life (AEL) Committee. Reviews and approves changes to
     factors used in development of Actuarial Removal Interval (ARI) tables for the
     distribution computation. Recommends/approves changes to factors based on the changes
     in engine reliability, employment of the weapon system, and maintenance philosophies
     that affect the ARI table development.
        7.1.2.9.1. Membership: The membership will consist of the Propulsion SM’s
        chairperson, TMS management team and all CEM operating the engine TMSM.
        7.1.2.9.2. Meeting Frequency: The AEL will be held annually at the call of the
        chairperson or when deemed necessary to correct accuracy of forecasting ARI Tables.
        Timing of meetings should allow incorporation of approved factor changes in the
        development of ARI tables to be used in the next PRS repair computation cycle used
        for budget purposes and the distribution computation cycle.
        7.1.2.9.3. Factors for Review: AEL members will review the following factors:
        Projected peace flying hours, Scheduled/Unscheduled Engine Removal Rates, Non-
        usage removal rates, Changes in operating limits and component life expectancy,
        Changes in operating limits and component life expectancy, JEIM Return Rates,
        Changes in force structures and utilization rates, Application percentages, Base and
        Depot screens, Hour to Cycle ratios, Periodic inspection requirements.
        7.1.2.9.4. AEL Process: The Propulsion SMs POC will forward necessary data to the
        MAJCOM CEMs prior to the meeting for review of proposed factor changes for use
        in development of the ARI tables. The data will include rationale for the changes and
        projected impacts of the changes in the removal forecasts. Only those engine
        programs with factor changes require presentation at the AEL meeting. The CEMs
        will review and assess the impacts of the proposed changes and provide any
        alternative or additional factor change recommendations to the actuaries for inclusion
        in the review process. They will be prepared to present supporting data and rationale
        for their proposal at the AEL meeting. Proposed changes and impacts will be
        presented and discussed at the AEL meeting. The committee members affected by the
        proposed changes will review, evaluate, and vote on approval and incorporation of
        the proposed changes in the development of ARI tables. If consensus of affected
        MAJCOMs and the Propulsion SM is not achieved, the Lead Command A4 will be
        the final approval/disapproval authority for any factor changes proposed. The
        Propulsion SM, for audit trail purposes, will maintain documentation of
        rationale/justification for approved factor changes.

     7.1.3. General Stock Level Computation Requirements:
        7.1.3.1. Unit Level Requirements Modeling: PRS computes safety stock levels at the
        lowest supply level.
            7.1.3.1.1. For units that fly and fight in place: PRS considers peacetime assets as
            available to support wartime pipeline requirements and stocks the unit with the
            greater of their peace or war requirement.
            7.1.3.1.2. For those units that deploy: The entry of a ―   J-Day‖ (JEIM availability
            day) determines if peacetime assets are available or not to support wartime pipeline
            requirements.
                7.1.3.1.2.1. A ― J-Day‖ of 1 means that peacetime assets are available and PRS
                stocks the unit with the greater of their peace or war requirement.
                7.1.3.1.2.2. A ―J-Day‖ entry greater than 1 means PRS will compute the unit
                stock considering that maintenance will not be available until the J-Day indicated,
                PRS then stocks these units with the sum of their peace and war requirement.
            7.1.3.1.3. The total number of spare engines required at a specific base, with more
            than one unit with the same MDS and TMSM combination is the sum of each unit’s
            peace or war requirement.
        7.1.3.2. Safety Stock Levels: Safety stock protects against pipeline shortages due to the
        uncertainty in the forecasted demand, repair production processes, and transportation
        pipeline performance. PRS computes safety stock levels for:
            7.1.3.2.1. The depot(s) based on repair and retrograde pipelines. PRS does it for each
            depot repair facility if there is more than one
            7.1.3.2.2. Each unit with an independent deployment or operational capability for
            both base repair and depot re-supply pipelines.
            7.1.3.2.3. Centralized JEIM repair facilities based on base repair, retrograde from the
            supported unit(s) and depot re-supply pipelines.
            7.1.3.2.4. Each Forward Operating Location (FOL) and Forward Supply Point (FSP)
            based on the serviceable re-supply pipeline from the JEIM site.
7.2. Acquisition Stock Level Computation: The purpose of the acquisition computation is to
determine the number of spare whole engines to be procured in support of each MDS/TMS.
     7.2.1. Policy: Spare whole engine acquisition requirements will be computed using PRS.
     The requirements computation process requires active involvement and support of the CEM,
     the Propulsion SM and, the engine manufacturer. The computations will be accomplished in
     accordance with this instruction. The USAF acquisition authority must obtain and review
     PRS initial acquisition computation prior to establishing an engine spares requirement for a
     new weapon system. For Contractor Logistics Supported (CLS) engines, PRS may be used to
     validate the contractor spare engine requirements estimates. Differences between Contractor
     and PRS spare engine requirements should be resolved, if necessary, between the Lead
     MAJCOM and the acquisition authority for the CLS program.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                 35


     7.2.1.1. Limit spare engine acquisition to the smallest number of engines essential to
     support the largest programmed requirement for each increment of the weapons system’s
     production contract.
     7.2.1.2. During System Development and Demonstration phase, perform an analysis to
     determine the cost effectiveness of making a buyout decision for the TMSM engine. If
     the TMSM engine is a commercial or commercial derivative engine, conduct a life cycle
     cost analysis considering the benefits of a fixed inventory and the associated costs for
     support and modifications. Before engine production ends, procure the quantity necessary
     to support the weapon system’s life cycle.
  7.2.2. Types of Acquisition Computations: There are four types of acquisition
  computations.
     7.2.2.1. Initial: The initial computation is the first computation performed for a new
     TMS. The Propulsion SM will determine when sufficient data are available to perform
     the baseline (initial) PRS computation.
     7.2.2.2. Annual: A computation will be performed annually after the initial computation
     to address any changes (program data, pipelines, maintenance concept, and actuarial data)
     that have occurred. The results shall be published in the ELMP.
     7.2.2.3. Buyout: The Propulsion SM performs a buyout computation to determine the
     final procurement quantity of spare whole engines for the TMS prior to the end of the
     engine production run. Buyout computations will be completed lead-time away from the
     closure of the engine production line.
     7.2.2.4. Others: Any changes to the force structure, weapon system procurement
     schedules, mission, or overall program changes could drive additional computations
     during the acquisition cycle.
  7.2.3. Acquisition Computation Process Description: This process is followed for any
  type of acquisition computation (see Figure 7.1).
     7.2.3.1. Initiate Computation: The Propulsion SM is responsible for the whole spare
     engine acquisition computation, and will initiate a review of the PRS model input factors
     to determine if an updated computation is required. If required, the EPM will initiate the
     action necessary to produce the updated computation. War planning scenario used for
     computation shall be consistent with current distribution war scenario policy. The CEM
     will provide any unique command requirements such as additives, FOLs, etc. Adequate
     written justification must be provided for all engine additives.
     7.2.3.2. Peace Flying Hours: The peacetime program is extracted from the latest PA
     document by the Propulsion SM’s POC. The force structure bed-down reflected in the PA
     document is updated by the Propulsion SM’s POC to reflect the latest approved bed-
     down changes. If the PA document does not contain the needed peacetime information,
     the CEMs will obtain and provide the peacetime information (flying hours and basing
     structure) to be used in the computation. Any force structure bed-down changes not
     contained in the latest PA must have adequate documentation and justification for
     inclusion in the computation.
36                                 AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010


        7.2.3.3. War Flying Hours: The wartime program is extracted from the RDAT based
        on the latest war computation policy provided by AF/A4M. Wartime hours related to the
        squadrons will be revised to maintain consistency with any changes identified in the
        peacetime program information. If the RDAT does not contain the needed wartime
        information, the MAJCOMs CEMs will obtain and provide the wartime information
        (flying hours and basing structure) to be used in the computation. Any force structure
        bed-down changes not contained in the latest RDAT must have adequate documentation
        and justification for inclusion in the computation.
        7.2.3.4. Actuarial Removal Intervals: The ARIs are developed by the ERO as
        previously detailed.
        7.2.3.5. Repair Pipeline Times: The field level and depot repair pipeline times are
        developed by the ERO for new programs with no experience.
        7.2.3.6. Transportation Pipeline Times: The transportation pipeline times are standards
        published by the Uniform Material Movement and Issue Priority System (UMMIPS).
        7.2.3.7. Maintenance Concept: The MPWG will provide the maintenance concept
        (both peace and war), including NRTS rate, to be used in the computation, once approved
        by the ERO.
        7.2.3.8. Concurrence of Computation Input Factors: Prior to accomplishing the
        computation, the Propulsion SM’s POC must obtain concurrence of the input factors
        from the ERO membership.
        7.2.3.9. Acquisition Stock Level Computation: The Propulsion SM’s POC or
        designated analyst will load the information into PRS and run the model.
     7.2.4. Coordination and Approval of Results: The Propulsion SM’s POC will seek
     MAJCOM review and coordination. The computation will be briefed to the Propulsion SM,
     and then the Wing Commander for review and endorsement, prior to review and approval by
     the SPM, and the PEO or applicable ALC Commander.
     7.2.5. Implementation Plan: The Propulsion SM will develop a plan to implement the
     results of the process.
     7.2.6. Buyout Support Period: Before the closure of the engine production line, a buyout
     computation will be performed to determine the number of spare engines required to support
     the applicable MDS during its planned life. The buyout computation will document whether
     the computation reflects maturity (Maturity=fleet age>500,000EFH) or another support
     period.
        7.2.6.1. During engine production, it is important to know the actual number of spare
        engines required to support a MDS. The Propulsion SM is authorized to initiate a
        computation that will reflect the actual number of spare engines required to support a
        MDS over a period of time (e.g., the next two to three years, with the requirement
        normally being computed quarter-by-quarter). This computation is beneficial when near
        term supportability problems are expected to occur and may result in the Propulsion SM
        making a spare engine procurement recommendation.
        7.2.6.2. The computation will reflect maturity when the engine has matured according to
        the information contained in paragraph 7.1.2.8.7. , above.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                 37


       7.2.6.3. When required to perform a buyout computation for an immature engine
       (Immature=fleet age<500,000EFH), the first step requires identifying the time period
       when the MDS should be fully supported, from a spare engine perspective. Unless
       separately identified by either AF/XO or the lead MAJCOM, the period to be fully
       supported begins with the delivery of the last MDS with the TMS being computed.
       Actuarial factors and pipeline times representing the supported period will be developed
       for use in the buyout computation. Depending on the estimated period of immaturity in
       years, it may be desirable to evaluate the requirement at various points, such as 1) the
       beginning of this period, 2) some interim period on the road to maturity (e.g. after
       completion of the next scheduled depot visit), and 3) at maturity. Computation results
       will be used by the Propulsion SM in recommending a spare engine procurement
       quantity.
   7.2.7. Small Fleet Policy: Before a TMS reaches maturity, it is important to know the
   actual number of spare engines required to support a MDS. The small fleet policy allows for
   the computation of spare engines using the projected ―actual‖ SVR and pipeline times. The
   intent is to show the actual number of spare engines required to support the MDS over the
   next two to three year time period, normally by computing the requirement quarter-by-
   quarter. The Propulsion SM may initiate a small fleet computation when near term
   supportability problems are expected to occur.
   7.2.8. Special Stock Levels: Engine managers generate special stock levels for:
       7.2.8.1. Engines with small inventories.
       7.2.8.2. Air breathing drone engines.
       7.2.8.3. Use the following percentages to establish stock levels when 10 or fewer new
       MDS aircraft are to be procured or remain in the inventory:
          7.2.8.3.1. For single engine aircraft, use 50 percent.
          7.2.8.3.2. For twin-engine aircraft, use 40 percent.
          7.2.8.3.3. For aircraft with more than two engines, use 30 percent.
       7.2.8.4. The owning MAJCOM and Propulsion SM jointly determine the operating unit’s
       stock level for air breathing drone engines. These stock levels are based on the
       operational and maintenance concept and the number of drones authorized for each
       location.
7.3. Distribution Stock Level Computation: The purpose of the distribution computation is to
determine spare whole engine operational requirements and distribution for using MAJCOMs
and Propulsion SM.
   7.3.1. Policy: Spare whole engine distribution stock level requirements will be computed
   using PRS in accordance with this instruction. If required, prior to the beginning of the
   distribution computation AF/A4M will provide additional written direction to address war
   scenario criteria or other policy changes not specifically addressed in this document.
   7.3.2. Distribution Stock Level Computation Process Description: The computation is
   conducted annually and is one of several events in the whole engine requirements process
   (see Figure 7.2). The computation requires a classified processing capability. Participants
38                                 AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010


     include MAJCOM CEMs, Propulsion SM’s POC, PRS functional manager, and DO87Q and
     WSMIS representatives.
        7.3.2.1. Peacetime Flying Hours: The peacetime program is extracted from the latest
        PA document from the PB. The data contains the peacetime flying hours for each MDS
        along with the current basing structure. The data is downloaded electronically by 754
        ELSG/LRW and formatted for input into the PRS database. If the PA document does not
        contain the needed peacetime information, the MAJCOM CEMs will obtain and provide
        the peacetime information (flying hours and basing structure) to be used in the
        computation. Any force structure bed-down changes not contained in the latest PA must
        have adequate documentation and justification for inclusion in the computation. Hard
        copies or electronic versions are forwarded to all participants for review and approval
        prior to the computation. The data is classified.
        7.3.2.2. War Flying Hours: The wartime program is extracted from the RDAT based on
        the latest war computation policy provided by AF/A5XW. The data is downloaded
        electronically by 754 ELSG/LRW and formatted for input into the PRS database. If the
        RDAT does not contain the needed wartime information, the MAJCOMs CEMs will
        obtain and provide the wartime information (flying hours and basing structure) to be used
        in the computation. Any force structure bed-down changes not contained in the latest
        RDAT must have adequate documentation and justification for inclusion in the
        computation. Hard copies or electronic versions are forwarded to all participants for
        review and approval prior to the computation. The data is classified.
        7.3.2.3. Actuarial Removal Interval (ARI): An ARI is developed for engine scheduled
        and unscheduled removals at any maintenance level. ARIs should be developed for both
        peace and war by Propulsion SM through mathematical models, simulations, statistical
        trends, and historical analysis. Forecast ARIs using factors approved by the AEL.
        Propulsion SM will:
           7.3.2.3.1. Maintain permanent documentation of supporting data, rationale,
           assumptions, and decisions as an appendix to the published ARI tables.
           7.3.2.3.2. Screen engine removals to exclude engine removals that merely facilitate
           other maintenance (FOM).
           7.3.2.3.3. Consider maintenance policies that govern the removal of life-limited
           components.
           7.3.2.3.4. Furnish ARI data for PRS computation by the end of March of each year.
        7.3.2.4. Repair Pipeline Times: TO 2-1-18 contains repair pipeline standards used
        during the PRS computation process. The TMS MPWG will review pipeline times at
        least annually and recommend changes to the standards contained in TO 2-1-18 when
        required. Recommended changes will be developed via guidance in T.O. 2-1-18, briefed
        to the Propulsion SM’s Chief/Lead Engineer and when approved by the Propulsion SM’s
        Chief/Lead Engineer and the Lead MAJCOM A4M, incorporated into TO 2-1-18.
        7.3.2.5. Transportation Pipeline Times: The Uniform Material Movement and Issue
        Priority System (UMMIPS) publish the transportation pipeline times.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                   39


     7.3.2.6. Basing/Maintenance Concept: The computation will use the basing structure
     contained within the PA/RDAT document and the current AF/A4M approved
     maintenance concept. Addition of bases required to account for spare engines pre-
     positioned at enroute locations to support transiting strategic airlift aircraft may also be
     included as FOL. Units that have multiple configurations of engines that cannot be
     interchanged due to engineering or safety of flight considerations may also be considered
     in basing concept.
     7.3.2.7. Concurrence of Computation Input Factors: All input factors will be
     coordinated with the MAJCOM CEMs and Propulsion SM. Prior to accomplishing the
     computation, the Propulsion SM must obtain concurrence of the input factors from the
     MAJCOM A4Ms.
     7.3.2.8. Distribution Stock Level Computation: 754 ELSG/LRW will load the
     information into PRS .The MAJCOM CEM will run the computation for their individual
     command. The Propulsion SM’s POC will accomplish a roll-up computation across all
     MAJCOMs for their given TMS.
        7.3.2.8.1. During the computation, all participants will review the inputs and results
        for accuracy. The PRS functional manager will insure that Air Force policy is
        complied with.
     7.3.2.9. Post Computation Actions: The Propulsion SM’s POC will review the output
     and determine spare engine availability vs. requirement immediately following the
     computation.
        7.3.2.9.1. Non-Constrained Allocations: If engine availability is non-constrained,
        engines are allocated to using commands in accordance with the PRS computations or
        approved additives. Adequate written justification for additives must be obtained
        from the MAJCOM.
        7.3.2.9.2. Constrained Allocations: A constrained engine is when the computed
        spare engine requirements exceed the total available spare engine inventory. If engine
        availability is constrained, the lead command will convene an IPT to coordinate an
        equitable allocation. The IPT will be comprised of one core member from each of the
        TMSM using commands and the Propulsion SM. The lead command MAJCOM/A4 is
        the final approval authority for constrained engine allocations.
            7.3.2.9.2.1. The following Constrained Spare Engine Allocation Process is a
            basic framework for constrained engine allocation IPT meetings (it is not all
            inclusive and may be modified for unique requirement and needs):
                7.3.2.9.2.1.1. TMS Manager: Prior to IPT: Review Propulsion
                Requirements System (PRS) computed rolled up levels. Allocate 100%
                against peacetime requirement (BSL and Repair Cycle Requirement).
                Determine negotiated/projected Depot returns. Adjust Depot pipeline
                requirement (if required). Compute wartime percentage against remaining
                engines. Determine depot safety levels allocation. Propulsion SM’s POC
                submits computed level in standard format and suggested allocation to lead
                command—include depot requirements (peace and war time) by unit.

                 7.3.2.9.2.1.2. Lead Command: Prior to IPT conference: Review Propulsion
                 SM’s POC recommended BSL/WRE allocation levels. Chair constrained
                 engine allocation IPT. Allocate 100% against peacetime requirement for all
                 locations. Coordinate equitable allocations of WRE and address any open
                 issues.
                 7.3.2.9.2.1.3. MAJCOMs: Prior to IPT conference: Provide justification for
                 additives (if required). Identify command specific requirements and issues.
                 Participate in IPT proceedings.
                 7.3.2.9.2.1.4. PRS Functional Manager: Following the IPT conference:
                 Consolidate PRS Computed and Allocated Engine Levels in Single
                 Document.
          7.3.2.9.3. Approval Process: After establishing the          recommended      engine
          allocations, the following actions will be accomplished:
              7.3.2.9.3.1. MAJCOM CEMs will coordinate allocated levels with their
              respective MAJCOM/A4
              7.3.2.9.3.2. Propulsion SM POCs will obtain coordination on allocated levels
              from their Propulsion SM..
              7.3.2.9.3.3. Non-concurrence of distribution stock levels based on the USAF
              approved computation and allocation process will be resolved by the lead
              MAJCOM/A4.
          7.3.2.9.4. Notification: The DoP will prepare official correspondence advising each
          MAJCOM CEM of their authorized Base Stock Level and War Readiness Engines. In
          turn, MAJCOM CEM will prepare official notification to all their assigned bases of
          their approved base stock level engines and applicable WRE engine levels with
          information copy to respective Propulsion SM. These levels remain in effect until the
          next computation cycle, unless changes have occurred requiring a mid-cycle re-
          computation, or as a result of negotiations between the MAJCOM CEM and the
          Propulsion SM.
          7.3.2.9.5. Redistribution of Engines: In some instances the computation or
          allocation will require a redistribution of spare engines. The lead MAJCOM CEM
          will be responsible for developing a redistribution plan to include the TMSM, the
          losing MAJCOM, the gaining MAJCOM, and the schedule for transfer. All engine
          transfers will be in accordance with T.O. 2-1-18. The plan will be provided by
          message to all users and the Propulsion SM.
          7.3.2.9.6. Schedule: All input factors should be available for review by mid April.
          PRS computation should be conducted by end of May, based on availability of the
          input factors. Coordination review period should begin immediately following the
          computation and allocation IPT. Complete approval should be obtained prior to
          implementation of the engine levels at the beginning of the fiscal year.
7.4. Whole Engine Requirements Considerations for QEC Kit Acquisition: SPM with
Propulsion SM input will determine the quantity of QEC kits to be bought. They are bought as
life-of-type items and are regulated by the quantity of spare engines.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                  41


   7.4.1. QEC Configurations: If there is more than one engine configuration, determine the
   requirement for each configuration by computing the proportions of each configuration
   installed on each aircraft. Then take the total raw computational requirement and multiply by
   the portion of each configuration (do not round off the requirement). Then take each new
   requirement to the ready rate table to determine requirement for each configuration and
   determine support requirement. Finally, add all configurations requirements together to
   determine total requirement.
7.5. Target Serviceable Requirement (TSR): For Combat Coded Units the TSR is equal to
the WRE requirement. For Non-Combat Coded Units, TSR is a portion of the computed
peacetime requirement that is necessary to be serviceable in support of special requirements.
TSR is not an additive requirement.
   7.5.1. Establishing a TSR: TSR is established at MAJCOM discretion. Computation of
   TSR is accomplished by analyzing PRS model results using 70% ready rate as a baseline and
   varying ready rates up to 99%. The delta between 70% and the higher ready rate would
   become TSR.
7.6. Additive Requirements: An Additive is a requirement not computed through normal
computational methodology and manually added to the PRS requirement. If PRS can compute
the requirement with validated rates and factors then an additive is not appropriate. Additive
requirements for retaining assets otherwise considered for disposal or termination are not
appropriate.
   7.6.1. Examples of Additive Requirements:
       7.6.1.1. Training: Assets required to provide a spare engine(s) used by Air Education
       and Training Command field training teams or detachments that do not have flying hours
       considered by PRS.
       7.6.1.2. Special Projects/Unit Segmentation: Assets required to provide spare
       engine(s) in support of undefined tasks as directed by AF or MAJCOMs.
       7.6.1.3. Small fleet multi engine aircraft where FOD/Bird-strike history combined with a
       normal failure could exceed computed BSL.
   7.6.2. Documentation of Additive Requirements: Documentation of all additives should
   fully explain how the additive quantity was determined and why the requirement could not be
   expressed through the conventional methodology (i.e., PRS). The requesting MAJCOM
   CEM and the TMS manager will keep all documentation as long as the additive is required
   and for two years after the additive is removed.
   7.6.3. Validation and Approval of Additives: Propulsion SM’s POC will validate an
   additive requirement as long as the requirement does not cause the engine to become
   constrained. Once an additive causes an engine to become constrained it will be validated by
   the appropriate constrained engine allocation IPT. Any approved additives that cover a
   period of more than one year will be validated annually with the submitting activity, in
   writing, to the governing body even when the requirements didn’t change.
7.7. Overhaul Computation: The Overhaul Computation process includes a whole engine
repair computation and negotiations of repair quantities to determine the number of whole
engines that will require depot or 2 Level Maintenance (2LM) for the current and next 6 years.
42                                   AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010


These repair quantities are used to determine the levels of spare parts required to repair those
engines and also the manpower and facilities required. Based on these forecasted numbers,
production capabilities, and budget authority the MAJCOM CEMs and Propulsion SM will
negotiate a production requirement for each TMSM. The amount of available MAJCOM/CAM
office funding drives the number of overhauls/repairs negotiated. Once the negotiated repair
levels are set, the operating commands and/or the CAM office in conjunction with operating
command priorities, commit to funding the inductions of the negotiated number of engines
during a particular time, and the repair facilities agree to repairing and returning, as serviceable,
an agreed to number of whole engines.
     7.7.1. Policy: Whole engine repair computations will be accomplished in accordance with
     this instruction. Repair computations will be conducted once a year, in preparation for the
     annual Reimbursable Conference. An out of cycle repair computation may be accomplished
     at the discretion of the SM’s POC. Use of AFMC Form 538 is required for all TMSM with a
     NRTS rate greater than zero.
     7.7.2. Repair Computation Process: The Propulsion SM’s POC performs the repair
     computation using an AFMC Form 538. See Attachment 2 for a detailed description of the
     computation.
     7.7.3. Approval Process: The AFMC repair computation will be reviewed and approved by
     the Propulsion SM.
     7.7.4. Increases to Computed Requirements: A negotiated increase is a requirement not
     computed through normal computational methodology and manually added to the computed
     repair requirement.
     7.7.5. Documentation of Increased Repair Requirements: Increased repair requirement
     documentation will be prepared by the requesting organization. The documentation must
     fully explain how the additional repair requirement was determined and why the requirement
     could not be determined via the repair computation process. The requesting MAJCOM CEM
     and the Propulsion SM’s POC will keep all documentation as long as the increased repair is
     required and for two years after the increase is removed.
     7.7.6. The results of the repair conference will be documented on AFMC Form 533, which
     converts the Overhaul Output requirement to an Input and Funding requirement.
     7.7.7. Post Conference Repair Requirement Increases: Repair requirement increases
     subsequent to the repair conference require documentation per para.7.7.5.. Retention of post
     conference repair increase documentation will also be retained in accordance with above
     guidance.
     7.7.8. Approval of Repair Increases: Repair requirement increases shall be approved in
     writing. Level of approval shall be commensurate with AFMC Justification and Approval
     levels for full and open competition for a proposed contract. Any increase in requirement
     will be forwarded to the AFMC CAM office to see if adequate and appropriate funding is
     available prior changing any actual workload. Level of approval will be based upon annual
     cumulative increased requirement.
        7.7.8.1. For a proposed increase not exceeding $550,000, the Propulsion SMs POC will
        serve as approval official.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                  43


      7.7.8.2. For a proposed increase over $550,000 but not exceeding $11,500,000, the
      Propulsion SM will serve as approval official.
      7.7.8.3. For a proposed increase over $11,500,000 but not exceeding $78,500,000, the
      approval official will be a general or flag office; or, a civilian in the Senior Executive
      Service.
7.8. Retention Computation: The purpose of the retention computation is to identify engine
retention requirements, inventory long supply and potential excess quantities for planning
appropriate management action.
   7.8.1. Policy: Retention computations will be conducted annually, following the PRS
   computation cycle or as needed to cover special program needs. The ALC EIM performs the
   retention computation.
   7.8.2. Approval Process: The Propulsion SM is the final approval authority for excess
   decisions. The Propulsion SM may delegate this authority as necessary. Potential excess
   quantities identified by the computation will be staffed through the Propulsion SM for
   approval. The Propulsion SM will approve or disapprove the excess quantity proposal. If
   Propulsion SM disapproves proposal, no further action is required. If Propulsion SM
   approves excess quantities the Propulsion SM’s POC coordinates with other DoD agencies to
   ensure a valid requirement does not exist for the TMS. Then, if appropriate, completes a
   FMS system support buy-out offer. All remaining excess engines are reviewed for possible

                             RECLAMATION AND DISPOSAL

8.1. General Policy Guidance:
   8.1.1. Engines are sent to reclamation only when it has been determined requirements for
   whole engines do not exist within DOD, and a valid FMS system support buy-out offer has
   been accomplished.
   8.1.2. The Propulsion SM will assume control of engine assets on aircraft held in storage
   codes XS or XT which transfer to XX or XV. Management control of the on-wing engines
   will transfer to the Propulsion SM to coincide with the storage code change. The engines will
   then be added into the Engine Requirements Retention Computation model. The available
   engines can then be used to offset whole engine requirements, be put into reclamation
   projects, or be disposed of through Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO).
   The Propulsion Single manager will be responsible for assuring all engine managers
   coordinate with the aircraft system program director to determine if AMARC-stored engines
   are needed to support aircraft mission or potential reuse and direct engine managers to
   dispose of engines no longer needed to support the Air Force mission, reclamation or foreign
   military sales.
   8.1.3. The Propulsion SM’s POC initiates reclamation action.
       8.1.3.1. When excess engines are available, before procuring engine spare parts, the
       Propulsion SM will review engine reclamation programs. The Propulsion SM will review
       the total reclamation requirement by engine TMS. The Propulsion SM will approve or
       disapprove the reclamation requirements. Reclamation items will be entered into the
       requirements system.
   8.1.4. The Propulsion SM is required to maintain visibility of their inactive engines. The
   Propulsion SM’s POC will evaluate the need for inactive engines identified on the annual
   AMARC engine listing in conjunction with the annual Distribution Stock Level
   Computation. The Propulsion SM’s POC will also be responsible for notifying AMARC
   officials of any disposal requirements based on this annual review.
8.2. Reporting. Engines reclaimed will be reported as losses in the CEMS DO42 database.
Additionally, TMS Managers are required to provide a biannual reclamation projects report by
TMS to Propulsion SM. The report should include as a minimum:
   8.2.1. Engine TMS.
   8.2.2. Number of engines changing storage code.
   8.2.3. Engine price.
   8.2.4. Cost of reclamation project.
   8.2.5. Estimated cost savings against parts requisition.

8.3. General Disposal Procedures. All reclamation residue and engines for which no
reclamation requirements exist will be transferred to the local DRMO activity for disposal (see
AFI 23-110CD). Exceptions may apply concerning engines that have resale value to OEM. In
addition, any residue resulting from engine reclamation that might be potential hazardous waste
will be turned in per AFI 32-7042, Solid and Hazardous Waste Compliance and/or potential
supplements or installation policies.

                                           Chapter 9

   ENGINE LEAD THE FLEET-PACER/ANALYTICAL CONDITION INSPECTION
                          (ACI) PROGRAM

9.1. Engine Lead the Fleet: The purpose of the Lead the Fleet (LTF) and Pacer/Analytical
Condition Inspection (ACI) engine programs are to determine actual distress modes of an engine
and its subsystems in the field. Only by monitoring engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs in field
operations can engineers understand all of the potential distress modes encountered by an engine
during operational use. Once these distress modes are identified, proper maintenance planning
can be conducted to allow the fleet to continue to operate safely.
   9.1.1. The Pacer Program is an accelerated mission usage program that can assist in
   maturing the engines/modules and its subsystems. The Pacer program provides early
   intelligence on engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs integrity, reliability, and maintainability before
   the majority of the fleet is impacted. The program is also designed to provide engineering
   data and procurement lead times for orderly updating and modification of the engine, as well
   as for the engine controls & accessories. The Propulsion SMs, MAJCOM representatives and
   Pacer Committees manage the program. Pacer engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs may also be
   used to test flight worthy new durability hardware that has been qualified by USAF and
   Original Equipment Manufacture (OEM) engineering.
9.2. Pacer Program Objectives:
   9.2.1. Accelerate usage of Pacer engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs ahead of the remaining fleet
   to identify potential premature engine component failures, enable early analysis of trends,
   failure modes/rates, and assist in defining the required corrective actions prior to maturity of
   the remaining fleet.
   9.2.2. Accurately update scheduled maintenance requirements. Safely extend Technical
   Order hardware inspection limits.
   9.2.3. Rapidly advance engine/module/accessory maximum life limits, so that they are
   consistent with the capability of the hardware.
   9.2.4. Enable early analysis of trending data to improve planning and forecasting in
   procuring initial and follow-on spares.
   9.2.5. Identify hardware service life deficiencies and the areas that require re-design/re-work
   before extensive production commitments are made and/or limited funds exhausted on
   obsolete hardware. Develop tasks to address design deficiencies. Generate CIP repair tasks to
   address wear out modes and allow for rework and re-use of hardware, reducing the need for
   new parts procurement. Repair procedures implemented in advance of scheduled inductions
   significantly reduces the maintenance cost, and benefit the commands.
   9.2.6. Identify hardware life impacts on systems support costs.
   9.2.7. Detect any unique durability problems that might force special scheduled inspections.
   9.2.8. Evaluate the engine controls and accessories to include engine monitoring systems.
48                                  AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010


     9.2.9. Provide lead-time for solving maintenance issues, developing maintenance plans, and
     resource provisioning.
     9.2.10. Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI) programs must be closely coupled with the
     Pacer engines and are included in AFMCI 21-102, Analytical Condition Inspection
     Programs.
     9.2.11. The Pacer and ACI programs support the overall ELMP.
9.3. Active Pacer Engine/Module Groups.
     9.3.1. For immature fleets (<500,000 EFH) use full engines as assets for the Pacer program
     as designated by the Pacer committee. Pacer committees will establish Active
     Engine/Modules Group. The Senior Leader for Propulsion may decide if a program needs to
     use a different definition of mature.
     9.3.2. For mature fleets (>500,000 EFH) consider using modules for Pacer program.
     9.3.3. Pacer engines/modules should have roughly the same TAC/CCY per EFH, hot time
     per EFH, mission time/operations time, and augmentor usage per EFH as compared to the
     rest of the fleet. Only the number of sorties/month should be affected by its status as an
     active Pacer asset.
9.4. Passive Pacer Engine/Module Group.
     9.4.1. Pacer committees will establish Passive Engine/Module Group.
     9.4.2. Passive Engine/Module Group is comprised of engines/modules that have greater than
     average number of cycles, but are not members of the Active Engine/Module Group.
     9.4.3. Pacer committee will consider replacing an Active Engine/Module with a Passive
     Engine/Module Group when an Active Engine/Module Group needs replacement due to
     failure or excessive maintenance down-time.
9.5. Analytical Condition Inspection
     9.5.1. A program prescribed by AFMCI 21-102 to reveal defects that may not otherwise be
     detected through normal technical order and programmed depot maintenance inspections. It
     also provides the opportunity to evaluate changes to the technical orders and possible life
     extensions.
     9.5.2. ACIs are normally required to substantiate a life limit extension. These inspection
     results in conjunction with historical failure data, failure mode and analysis are used to
     generate a safety analysis. This assessment quantifies the potential risk of the life limit
     increase.
     9.5.3. There are two basic types of ACIs; intermediate level and depot level
        9.5.3.1. Intermediate Level
            9.5.3.1.1. Performed at the JEIM by depot and/or OEM engineering.
            9.5.3.1.2. Typically performed to examine one area of the engine (e.g., hot section).
            9.5.3.1.3. Depot and OEM engineering inspect the engines and record findings.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                      49


         9.5.3.1.4. Excellent method to determine what is happening with a small number of
         engines without the downtime associated with a depot level ACI.
      9.5.3.2. Depot Level
         9.5.3.2.1. Performed at the depot or OEM overhaul facility by depot and/or OEM
         engineering.
         9.5.3.2.2. Complete look at all parts of the engine for an extensive engineering
         review.
         9.5.3.2.3. ACIs are performed in two primary steps.
         9.5.3.2.4. Dirty layout – engine is disassembled into modules and laid out for
         engineering evaluation.
         9.5.3.2.5. Clean layout – engine is disassembled to the piece part level and cleaned.
         9.5.3.2.6. ACIs will identify potential issues with the engine design and also the
         possibility for extending life intervals.
9.6. Lead the Fleet/Pacer/ACI Program Management Responsibilities:
   9.6.1. Propulsion SM:
      9.6.1.1. A Pacer Committee will be formed in the early stages of the Pacer Program,
      chaired by the responsible Propulsion SM or designated representative, with membership
      from the TMS management teams, MAJCOM/A4M, OEM, and other
      individuals/agencies designated by the committee chair.
      9.6.1.2. Committees will establish meeting frequency. In order for meetings to be
      effective full participation from all members is required. Where possible, meetings
      should be held in conjunction with Component Improvement, Logistics Planning
      Conference, User’s Conference or Maintenance Planning Working Group meetings.
      9.6.1.3. Assist the MAJCOM/A4Ms in distributing Pacer engines evenly among the
      operational squadrons to ensure full range of missions and environments are encountered
      by the Pacer fleet.

        each item required will then be handled through the individual item managers for
        expedited shipment to the requesting unit.
        9.6.1.11. Preview trending data from Pacer engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs. Provide the
        logistics community with the results of the ACI to allow provisioning within lead-time
        for supportability of findings.
        9.6.1.12. Request supply Project Codes from HQ AFMC for Pacer part requisitions.
        9.6.1.13. Draft memorandum of agreements between using MAJCOM/A4Ms, describing
        Pacer Program management and responsibilities. MOAs will be reviewed every 2 years
        or as changes require for currency.
        9.6.1.14. Coordinate with participating field units to schedule the latest TCTO
        configurations to be installed at the earliest opportunity after TCTO release on all Pacer
        engine/ components.
     9.6.2. MAJCOMs:
        9.6.2.1. Designate a primary and alternate Pacer program monitor for each engine type.
        These individuals will be members of the Pacer Committee.
        9.6.2.2. Assist the Pacer program committees in designating units who will be required
        to participate in the Pacer Program and all related meetings.
        9.6.2.3. Assure that participating field unit requirements are met.
        9.6.2.4. Provide assistance, as required, to depot Propulsion SMs, OEM, and field units
        to conduct the Pacer Program.
        9.6.2.5. Assure that participating field units are aware of program requirements and
        direct efforts to meet these goals.
        9.6.2.6. Assure that Pacer Program monitoring systems and policies are established at the
        appropriate numbered Air Force units and participating field units.
        9.6.2.7. Provide assistance, as required, to the depot and field units for conducting the
        Pacer Program.
     9.6.3. Participating Field Units:
        9.6.3.1. Strive to accelerate pacer engines at twice the normal flying rate until the
        engine/modules/accessories are, at a minimum, two years ahead of the top 10% (high
        time) fleet engines. The engines/modules/accessories are then to continue leading the
        fleet by two years. The goal of ―   twice the normal flying rate‖ will be calculated by
        doubling the average monthly total operating time for the squadron’s passive engines. As
        a minimum, the field units should fly the Pacer engines at least 2x the unit fleet average
        per month or the set goal determined by the TMSM PACER committee to achieve and
        maintain the desired lead time over high time passive engines.
        9.6.3.2. Publish local instructions that, as a minimum, establish scheduling, maintenance,
        records keeping functions, parts requisition procedures, and reporting procedures for
        Pacer engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                  51


     9.6.3.3. Maintenance Group Commanders will designate a primary and alternate Pacer
     Program monitor. Unit monitors and alternates will be identified to MAJCOM and engine
     program manager via email/formal message to include name, rank, organization, phone
     number, and e-mail. Pacer Program monitors will be established in both organizational
     and     intermediate      units.    Their   function will     be    to  ensure  Pacer
     engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs receive priority attention and all maintenance actions are
     properly documented. Pacer monitor representatives will be appointed and briefed on
     their responsibilities prior to deployment.
     9.6.3.4. Units will establish maintenance management procedures to ensure Pacer
     engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs are dedicated to the flying schedule to the maximum extent
     possible. Measures to ensure Pacer engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs meet set
     goals/standards are: Pacer engine status presented at weekly maintenance meeting. Pacer
     engines removed from any aircraft that is down for maintenance more than 10 duty days
     should be reinstalled into an aircraft active in the flying schedule.
     9.6.3.5. The applicable TMS manager will be notified immediately when accessories or
     major components are removed for maintenance. Removal of major components from a
     Pacer engine for cannibalization to another engine or consideration of the Pacer engine’s
     maintenance waivers for continued service requires prior approval of the Propulsion SM.
     9.6.3.6. Field units will clearly mark all Pacer Program assets being returned to the depot
     or to the contractor. The reason for removal and a description of the defects noted will be
     included. Engine specific Pacer Project Code will be used when requisitioning and
     shipping assets.
     9.6.3.7. Pacer components will be requisitioned through normal supply channels. When
     components are requisitioned, unit Pacer monitors will contact applicable TMS manager
     and give part number, national stock number, quantity, and requisition number (off-base
     requisition number).
     9.6.3.8. Replacement of Pacer engine parts and/or components with earlier released
     versions is not authorized without prior approval of the Propulsion SM.
     9.6.3.9. TMS    managers      will    report   monthly status      of   their  Pacer
     engine/modules/LRUs/SRUs to their MAJCOM/A4M and Propulsion SM. Reports are
     due by the 7th duty day of each month. Reports will include, but not limited to,
     engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs serial number, average TACs accumulated for the wing,
     TAC’s accumulated (Month & Total) for the Pacer engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs, any
     maintenance performed on the Pacer engines/modules/LRUs/SRUs and a brief
     explanation why the engines didn’t meet the desired flying goal. Pacer Committee will
     determine any additional reporting requirements.
     9.6.3.10. Provide assistance (manpower, facilities, and expendables) in performing Mini-
     ACIs. The mini-ACI permits a quick turnaround on engines that do not require a
     complete teardown. Requested ACI support shall be within the capabilities of each field
     maintenance unit. When mini-ACI is to be performed at intermediate level, contact the
     MAJCOM committee member and Propulsion SM for a list of expected parts fall out, and
     requisition accordingly.

                COMPUTATION OF ENGINE REPAIR REQUIREMENT

Figure A2.1.




A2.1. (Line 1) Engine Hours – Peace: The whole engine repair requirements computation begins
with the flying hours for the engine and Major Command (MAJCOM) being projected. These
flying hours represent the peacetime flying hours projected for the engine and are based on the
PA tape received from Air Staff.
A2.2. (Line 2) ARI Factor: For the purposes of calculating the whole engine repair requirement,
only the Overhaul Removal Interval (OHRI/WMT) is used. The OHRI/WMT reflects the
average number of flying hours between engine overhauls and/or 2-Level Maintenance (2LM)
repairs which both occur at a depot or contractor facility.
A2.3. (Line 3) Usage Change: The result of this calculation (Line 1 divided by Line 2)
represents the usage changes for overhaul and/or 2LM action for the engine for the computed
period.
A2.4. (Line 6) Total Stockage Requirement: In addition to the whole engines required to support
the projected flying hour program, a certain number are needed to maintain a certain stock level
for the applicable MAJCOM. This total stockage level is comprised of a Base Stock Level (BSL)
objective and the depot safety level requirement:
A2.5. (Line 4) Base Stockage Objective: The BSL objective represents the number of engines a
MAJCOM is required to have available or ―  in stock‖ at their installations. BSL can be either
64                                    AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010


computed by the Propulsion Requirements System (PRS) or negotiated by the engine ALC EIM
and MAJCOM
A2.6. (Line 5) Safety Level Requirement: The safety level represents the number of engines a
MAJCOM is required to maintain over and above their BSL to support the unevenness of
generations. These are usually maintained at the depot/repair facility.
A2.7. (Line 6) Beginning Inventory (line 6, 1st Column): The beginning inventory represents
the adjusted MAJCOM spare asset position at the end of the period prior to the time frame being
computed.
A2.8. (Line 7) Asset Variance: The total stockage requirement is compared to the assets on hand
or projected to be on hand at the beginning of the period being calculated (end of the previous
quarter). The delta between the requirement and the beginning inventory represents the
additional engines that must be repaired to maintain the stock level. If more engines are in the
inventory at the beginning of a computation period than are required to meet the stock level of
the MAJCOM, these assets can be used to offset either the flying hour requirement or other
obligations. This calculation will normally only result in a delta during the first quarter of the
computation or of a fiscal year since a new BSL is only established once a year.
A2.9. (Lines 8 and 9) Serviceable Obligation–Loss and Serviceable Obligation–Other: Engines
may also be obligated for other uses which will increase the overhaul requirement. Service
Obligation–Loss refers to those serviceable assets that have been obligated to another use such as
a training requirement or a FMS customer. Service Obligation–Other represents those
serviceable assets that have been obligated to another service within the DoD, payback to
another MAJCOM, Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM), etc.
A2.10. (Line 10) Gross Overhaul Requirements: The Gross Overhaul Requirement is calculated
using the sum of the following:
     A2.10.1. The engines need to support the peacetime flying hour program (Line 3).
     A2.10.2. The assets needed to cover the difference between the BSL plus safety
     requirements and the inventory on hand at the beginning of the period being computed. (Line
     7).
     A2.10.3. The engines obligated by the MAJCOM for another use (Lines 8 and 9).
A2.11. (Line 11) Projected Serviceable Receipts: Prior to the calculation of the final (net)
overhaul output requirement, the Gross Overhaul Requirement is offset by any serviceable assets
the MAJCOM expects to receive from any source (e.g., new production, return of low time
assets from AMARC, etc.).
A2.12 (Line 12) Net        Overhaul Requirements: The net overhaul requirement is the Gross
Overhaul Requirement       (Line 10) offset by the Projected Serviceable Receipts (Line 11). This
requirement represents     the number of engines that must be available as output from the depot
level repair facility to   satisfy all of the MAJCOMs requirements for that engine during the
period.
A2.13. (Line 13) Current Schedule/Adjusted Requirements: This requirement considers any
adjustment between the current scheduled production and the repair requirement. In the first
quarter, enter the current project directive (or contract) negotiated output quantity. Compare this
quantity with the figure on line 12. If the current schedule is greater than line 12, subtract the
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                     65


overage from the next quarter entry on line 12 and enter the result. Continue until the overage is
absorbed. If the current schedule is less than the figure on line 12, the shortage will be added to
the next quarter line 12 requirement. After the initial adjustment has been accomplished, lines 12
and 13 will be equal. These quantities become the Adjusted Requirement. This number serves as
the basis for the negotiation process and is eventually converted to the number of engines that
must be input into the repair pipeline. The input requirement is what is ultimately converted to a
dollar requirement for publication into the DPEM Brochure.

                              ENGINE HEALTH INDICATORS

A3.1. General Information: This information applies to all DoP portfolio engine programs. It
defines the engine health indicators that will be used for propulsion systems health reporting and
explains the criteria for evaluating these metrics. The objective of this instruction is to drive a
desired program behavior with standardized engine metrics, providing leadership a
comprehensive overview of readiness and sustainment issues. The metrics and indicators are
organized by the capability or attribute that they are intended to measure.
     A3.1.1. Secondary Notes:
        A3.1.1.1. Each Metric/Indicator is divided into four sections:
           A3.1.1.1.1. Metric Objective
           A3.1.1.1.2. Metric Description
           A3.1.1.1.3. Metric Methodology
           A3.1.1.1.4. Metric Interpretation
                A3.1.1.1.4.1. Those metrics that have established goals will display stoplight
                indicators on the same page as the graph and support data. The goals will be
                generated for each Type Model Series Modification (TMSM, i.e. engine type).
                The stoplight indicators cover the current reporting period, however, stoplight
                indicators for future periods are subjective assessments and require management
                decision.
                A3.1.1.1.4.2. Some metrics provide a historical trend and will not be assigned a
                goal and relevant stoplight indicators.
A3.2. Safety:
     A3.2.1. Engine System Safety (ESS):
        A3.2.1.1. Metric Objective: The Engine System Safety metric is a composite over-
        arching measurement of safety risk for a given TMS. ESS tracks all the safety issues on
        each TMS and establishes an overall system risk related to the individual risk of each
        identified safety issue. The goal of risk management of aircraft gas turbine engines is to
        help to maintain highly reliable and effective engines while minimizing flight safety and
        operational impacts. The goal of the ESS metric is to minimize flight safety.
        A3.2.1.2. Metric Description: The ESS metric tracks all known safety issues for a
        given TMS. The issues identified by this metric are those that are identified by the Gas
        Turbine Engine Risk Management Process, detailed in the Propulsion Center of
        Excellence, Best Practice manual, BP 99-06, Revision A.
           A3.2.1.2.1. A safety issue can be identified from a number of sources, to include,
           Deficiency Reports (DR), In-flight Shutdowns (IFSD), Non-Recoverable In-flight
           Shutdowns (NRIFSD), Engine Related Loss of Aircraft (ERLOA), test and
           evaluation, research and development, field, overhaul, and mishaps.
           A3.2.1.2.2. Once identified, the issue is assessed for its relative risk.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                    67


        A3.2.1.2.3. Assessed risk can then be mitigated through several different methods, to
        include material changes, process changes and maintenance/inspection practices.
        Each risk mitigation action is tracked via the ESS metric.
     A3.2.1.3. Metric Interpretation: The ESS presents the number of known safety issues,
     grouped according to their risk color code defined by PCOE BP 99-06, Appendix B, and
     presented in a stacked bar chart posted quarterly for each TMS.
        A3.2.1.3.1. Each Individual Safety Issue is assigned a stoplight indicator of Red,
        Yellow, or Green according to its assessed risk level and its related risk mitigation
        actions. TMS’s that have 1 or more red issues are scored an overall engine safety
        status score of red. TMS’s that have zero red issues but 1 or more yellow issues are
        scored an overall score of yellow. TMS’s that have zero red issues and zero yellow
        issues are considered green.
  A3.2.2. Non-Recoverable In-Flight Shut-Down (NRIFSD):
     A3.2.2.1. Metric Objective: This safety indicator allows quarterly trending of NRIFSD
     rate for a given TMS. Action required when for exceeding established the PST on this
     indicator can be found in PCoE BP 99-06, Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine Flight Safety
     Risk Management Process. The goal of this metric is to minimize the NRIFSD rate.
     A3.2.2.2. Metric Description: Any engine shutdown in-flight, either due to an engine
     malfunction or by the aircrew following flight manual procedures whereby: The engine is
     unable to restart, or further investigation determines that a restart attempt would not have
     been successful, or further investigation determines that continued operation would have
     caused the engine to fail, or the aircraft cannot maintain level flight at a safe altitude as
     determined by the situation. (AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports, 14 Feb
     2006)
     A3.2.2.3. Metric Methodology: NRIFSD rate is calculated as the number of NRIFSD
     in the fleet within a time interval divided by the EFHs within the same interval,
     multiplied by 100,000. This metric will show the 6 quarter rolling average and a
     cumulative value for each quarter of the fiscal year. Number of NRIFSD is defines as the
     NRIFSD rate within a time interval times the EFHs within the same interval divided by
     100,000.
  A3.2.3. Engine Related Loss of Aircraft (ERLOA):
     A3.2.3.1. Metric Objective: This safety indicator allows quarterly trending of ERLOA
     for a given TMS. Action required when for exceeding established the PST on this
     indicator can be found in PCoE BP 99-06, Aircraft Gas Turbine Engine Flight Safety
     Risk Management Process.
     A3.2.3.2. Metric Description: An engine related mishap resulting in destruction of an
     Air Force aircraft.
     A3.2.3.3. Metric Methodology: ERLOA is calculated as the number of engine related
     loss of aircraft in the fleet life per 100,000 engine flying hours. ERLOA will show the 6
     quarter rolling average and cumulative value per quarter for each fiscal year. Mishap data
     is obtained from the AFSAS database maintained by the USAF Safety office.

A3.3. Availability:
     A3.3.1. War Readiness Engine (WRE):
        A3.3.1.1. Metric Objective: To determine if there are sufficient serviceable spare
        engines to support the Air Force wartime mission.
        A3.3.1.2. Metric Description:
           A3.3.1.2.1. War Readiness Engines (WRE): The number of net serviceable engines
           available to support the Air Force’s war tasking. These engines are to be available to
           support a weapon system from the start of the war until re-supply (via base,
           intermediate and /or depot repair) is established.
           A3.3.1.2.2. Required WRE: WRE determined by the completed Propulsion
           Requirements System process to support a worst case Air Force war tasking.
           (Required WRE is determined with the Propulsion Requirements System (PRS)
           Distribution computation)
           A3.3.1.2.3. Allocated WRE: WRE established when there are insufficient assets or
           other constraints to support Required WRE; or established to support an increase to
           Required WRE when additives and/or Target Serviceable Requirements (TSR) are
           applied to the Required WRE. Available assets are allocated against the requirement.
           This quantity is determined by the Engine Allocation Integrated Process Team,
           which is chaired by the Lead Command with members from all using MAJCOMs.
           A3.3.1.2.4. Non-combat coded units utilize a Target Serviceable Requirement (TSR)
           instead of WRE. TSR values will be treated like WRE requirements and follow
           established goals like WRE.
        A3.3.1.3. Metric Methodology:
           A3.3.1.3.1. Data for computing the WRE metric can be found in the Propulsion
           Automatic Re-supply Report in CEMS. Any new CEMS users can contact the CEMS
           office at Tinker AFB (448 CBSG/PE) to start a new account and obtain CEMS
           educational opportunities or introductory briefings. CEMS website is;

     Green: WRE is greater than or equal to Allocated or Required WRE. There are enough
     serviceable spare engines to meet a worse case war mission.

     Yellow: WRE is less than the Required WRE and greater than or equal to the
     Allocated WRE. The ALC/Product Center and MAJCOM operating units are meeting
     their allocated supportability level.

     OR
     A subjective assessment of yellow may be given based on other supportability issues
     even though WRE meets or exceeds Required WRE.

     Red: WRE is less than the Required or Allocated WRE. If there is no Allocated WRE
     value and WRE is less than Required WRE then a color rating of red applies. The
     ALC/Product Center and MAJCOM operating units are not meeting their
     Required/Allocated supportability levels.

     NOTE: In the event the Allocated WRE is set ABOVE the Required level, color ratings
     are:

     Green: At or above the ALLOCATED level

     Yellow: Below the ALLOCATED level but at or above the REQUIRED level

     Red: Below the REQUIRED level
  A3.3.2. Base Stock Level (BSL):
     A3.3.2.1. Metric Objective: To determine if there are sufficient spare engines to
     support the Air Force peace and war mission to an 80% ready rate for combat coded units
     and a 70% for non-combat coded units.
     A3.3.2.2. Metric Description:
        A3.3.2.2.1. Engine Base Stock Level (BSL) is the number of spare engines
        (serviceable and unserviceable) required at the bases to support the Air Force mission
        (both peace and war) to an 80% ready rate for combat coded units and a 70% ready
        rate for non-combat coded units.
        NOTE: WRE is a subset of BSL
        A3.3.2.2.2. Required BSL: BSL determined by the completed Propulsion
        Requirements System Process to support the Air Force mission (both peace and war)

        to an 80% ready rate for combat coded units and a 70% ready rate for non-combat
        units. (Required BSL is determined with DISTRIBUTION computations).
        A3.3.2.2.3. Allocated BSL: The BSL established due to insufficient assets or other
        constraints to support of the Required BSL. Available assets are allocated against the
        requirement. This quantity is determined by the Constrained Engine Integrated
        Process Team, which is chaired by the Lead Command with members from all using
        MAJCOMs.
        A3.3.2.2.4. On Hand: Actual number of spare engines at the bases that are available
        to count against the BSL, including engines in-transit to the base (both repairable and
        serviceable). The ON Hand in this metric is the average for the quarter.
     A3.3.2.3. Metric Methodology:
        A3.3.2.3.1. Data for BSL Computations can be found in the Propulsion Automatic
        Re-supply Report in CEMS. Refer to WRE section for CEMS navigation.
        A3.3.2.3.2. Metric Computations: On Hand BSL (Weekly Snapshot) equals the Tot.

     NOTE: Serviceable Due Ins Must be in a SB status = Serviceable Built Up

        Obligations to base possessed aircraft are already excluded in the net serviceable
        computation. Obligations to Depot possessed aircraft will also be excluded for those
        aircraft in depot that exceed the base level Backup Aircraft Inventory.

     A3.3.2.4. Metric Interpretation:
     Green: On Hand assets greater than or equal to 90% of the Required BSL spare engines
     to meet the weapon systems war and peace mission.
     Yellow: On Hand Assets are less than 90% of the Required BSL and greater than or
     equal to 90% of the Allocated BSL. Center is meeting supportability goals established by
     the MAJCOMs. OR A subjective assessment of yellow may be given based on other
     supportability issues even though On Hand assets meet or exceeds 90% of the Required
     BSL.

     Red: On Hand is less than 90% Allocated BSL. If there is no Allocated BSL value and
     On Hand is less than 90% Required, then a color rating of red applies. The Center is not
     meeting the supportability goals established by the MAJCOMs.

     Note: Occasionally the Allocated BSL is set ABOVE the Required level. Although this
     is a rare occurrence, Color Ratings in this event are:

     Green: At or above 90% of the ALLOCATED level

   A3.3.3. Engine Not Mission Capable for Supply (ENMCS):
      A3.3.3.1. Metric Objective:
          A3.3.3.1.1. Determine if the flow of parts is adequate to support the field’s need for
          those parts in their current operating environment.
          A3.3.3.1.2. An engine is considered ENMCS if it is an uninstalled engine undergoing
          repair or build-up where work stoppage resulted because spare parts from local
          resources were not available and the required parts have been requisitioned from the
          source of supply. An engine is not considered ENMCS when it is in work and a work
          stoppage occurs for lack of manpower, tools, work space, or parts that are in repair
          cycle processing (Due In from Maintenance, DIFM) and a valid ENMCS situation
          does not exist. ENMCS only apply to uninstalled engines.
      A3.3.3.2. Metric Description:
          A3.3.3.2.1. Average quantity and/or percent of uninstalled engines that are in work
          stoppage condition awaiting parts from the supply system over a given time period.
          A3.3.3.2.2. ENMCS GOAL: Acceptable quantity and/or percent of the uninstalled
          engines that are in NMCS status and/or the acceptable number of engines in NMCS
          status. (10% ENMCS and or 10 engines. Trainer engines (J85, J69 only) are
          measured 20% ENMCS and/or 20 engines)
          A3.3.3.2.3. ENMCS%: The average percent of the uninstalled engines that were
          ENMCS during a given time period.
          A3.3.3.2.4. # ENMCS Engines: The average quantity of ENMCS engines during the
          time period.
      A3.3.3.3. Metric Methodology:

A3.4. Reliability:
     A3.4.1. Average Time On Wing (ATOW) and Mean Time Between Removal (MTBR):
       A3.4.1.1. Metric Objective: ATOW and MTBR are similar metrics that provide a
       macro-level indication of engine reliability.
       A3.4.1.2. Metric Description:
                 A3.4.1.2.1. Time on wing is the fundamental indicator of an engine’s
                 reliability. An effective maintenance plan based upon principles of Reliability
                 Centered Maintenance (RCM) will drive up the time on wing of an engine to
                 the hardware’s inherent capability. Depot, MAJCOMs, and field units will
                 use ATOW or MTBR as the primary metric to measure RCM program
                 effectiveness and overall engine reliability health.
          A3.4.1.2.2. Engine programs will report both total and inherent time on wing or
          MTBR. Both measures exclude all serviceable built up removals. The inherent time
          on wing or MTBR will also exclude removals for FOD, fuel/oil contamination, and
          other maintenance faults exclusive of the design.
       A3.4.1.3. Metric Methodology:
          A3.4.1.3.1. Engine programs can use either MTBR or ATOW to measure engine
          reliability. The goals for MTBR and ATOW are the same. The charts will be titled to
          reflect the method selected.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                            73


           A3.4.1.3.2. Mean Time Between Removal (MTBR) is defined as:

                         EFHfleet
            MTBR 
                       # removals
Where engine flying hours for the fleet (EFHfleet) and number of engine removals were captured
over some period of time, typically each quarter year.

           A3.4.1.3.3. Average Time on Wing (ATOW) is defined as:


            ATOW 
                        EFH   removed_engine

                          # removals
Where the engine flying hours for removed engines (  EFHremoved_engine ) is the sum of flying hours
since the last removal on only the engines removed in a given quarter. CEMS and Propulsion
Actuarial Client/Server (PACS) do not report this number automatically; it must be calculated
manually.
           A3.4.1.3.4. Quarterly data from the Comprehensive Engine Management System
           (CEMS) is used for EFH and number of removals. Engine flying hours can be found
           on CEMS product G232, Aircraft Engine Experience Analysis Report. Removals are
           taken from CEMS product G341, Aircraft Engine Removal and Loss Report.
           A3.4.1.3.5. ATOW or MTBR will be posted quarterly using a 4 quarter rolling
           average to smooth any seasonal variation.
           A3.4.1.3.6. MTBR or ATOW are undefined if no engines are removed in a quarter.
           This can be a problem for small engine programs, or when looking at the ATOW or
           MTBR of a sub-population, such as RCM builds. Ignore such quarters in the 4 quarter
           rolling average calculation.
           A3.4.1.3.7. Each program will report both a Total and Inherent reliability value for
           each quarter. If the ATOW methodology is used to represent reliability for an engine
           program, then the Total and inherent reliability values will be represented as TOTAL
           ATOW and INHERENT ATOW. If the MTBR methodology is used to represent
           reliability for an engine program, then the Total and Inherent reliability values will be
           represented as TOTAL MTBR and INHERENT MTBR.
           A3.4.1.3.8. Total and Inherent reliability values are calculated the same way when
           using ATOW or MTBR. Total and Inherent reliability values differ based upon what
           removals are counted.
           A3.4.1.3.9. Calculate Total reliability using all removals reported in CEMS except
           Transaction Condition Code LB.
           A3.4.1.3.10. Calculate the Inherent reliability by excluding all non-inherent (or
           induced) removals. Non-inherent removals are either those with Transaction
           Condition Code LB or with the HOW MAL codes (HMCs) shown in the table below.
           A3.4.1.3.11. The total reliability is useful to MAJCOM planners as an overall
           indicator of reliability. Engine program managers can control Inherent reliability and
74                                  AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010


         will be accountable for optimizing it. SRAN engine managers must be trained and
         understand their crucial roll in the reporting procedure. Clean, accurate data is vital.
         A3.4.1.3.12. TCTO compliance may be scheduled or unscheduled maintenance
         usually to correct or mitigate design problems and therefore is chargeable to the
         engine Inherent reliability. All TCTO removals will be included in Inherent
         reliability, unless transaction condition code LB applies.
         A3.4.1.3.13. Note, an ― unserviceable removal‖ is defined as an action that drives the
         engine into I-level maintenance. Maintenance performed entirely at the O-level is not
         reported as a removal in CEMS, and likewise not counted in ATOW or MTBR.
         A3.4.1.3.14. The Maintenance Planning Working Group (MPWG), through the lead
         command, is responsible for addressing inaccurate reporting of engine removals.

         A3.4.1.4.1. Inherent Design Reliability (IDR) provides a baseline for establishing a
         TMSs reliability goal in collaboration with the Lead MAJCOM.
AFI 21-104_LITTLEROCKAFBSUP_I 23 MARCH 2010                                                 75


        A3.4.1.4.2. The IDR for immature fleets (<500,000EFH) / populations is determined
        as follows: Use the engine’s first run interval, where the first run interval is the
        anticipated average EFH on all engines when first removed for maintenance,
        including UERs. A higher number may be appropriate when major upgrades are
        incorporated or a lower number may be appropriate when thrust is increased.
        A3.4.1.4.3. The IDR for mature fleets (>500,000EFH) / populations is determined as
        follows: If historical data is not sufficient or applicable to determine the first run
        interval, inherent reliability will be assumed to be such that 10% of the engines are
        currently on wing longer than the inherent reliability. This may be done using a recent
        time-on-wing histogram and locating the 90th percentile.
        A3.4.1.4.4. All programs must submit their IDR with justification and a graph of the
        ATOW or MTBR metric looking back 3 years to the Propulsion Engineering Council
        for review by the Propulsion Senior Leader and approval by the DoP.
        A3.4.1.4.5. Programs will submit a graph of Total ATOW or MTBR and Inherent
        ATOW or MTBR, with a color rating based on the inherent ATOW or MTBR relative
        to the goal established in collaboration and agreement with the Lead MAJCOM.
        Green: Inherent ATOW or MTBR> Goal Established by Lead MAJCOM

        Yellow: Inherent ATOW or MTBR is less than 100% of goal and greater than75% of

     reasons (SER + UER + TCTO ER) and subsequently sent to an intermediate maintenance
     shop or a depot for repair within a time interval divided by the EFH within the same
     interval, multiplied by 1000.
     A3.4.2.4. Metric Interpretation: The total SV rate is considered to be the inverse of
     the total ATOW or total MTBR; therefore the goals for total SV are the inverse of those
     goals listed for the total ATOW or total MTBR.

           A3.6.1.3.7. Establish the baseline for each TMS using the 2 to 5 (depending on
           accuracy of AFTOC data) previous year’s data (initially establish using FY01 thru
           FY05). Use the baseline to establish the Goal for each TMS. Each TMS must take
           into consideration known workscope changes and projected reliability. A standard
           methodology for projecting the future does not exist. Inputs to be considered include
           the age of the engine and the standard workscope to be accomplished at the next
           scheduled maintenance event. Investments for engine upgrades and modifications
           will result in increased costs and improved reliability in the future. An estimate of
           when the improved reliability will occur should be reflected in the TMS Goal.
NOTE: Verify the accuracy of AFTOC data for the Depot Maintenance (CAIG Element 4.0) by
comparing to actual historical data. Check each fiscal year whole engine input schedule and sales
price, if the resulting amount is within +/- 5% of the AFTOC amount, no further action is
required. If the variance exceeds +/- 5%, then use the actual historical data. In addition, action
should be taken to notify AFTOC and the MAJCOM of the discrepancy and request a review by
AFTOC to determine the source of the discrepancy. An analysis of the historical data should be
conducted to ensure that the most accurate material costs are used. If your material cost varied
significantly from year to year and did not correspond with your ERRB and SRRB inputs, use
your discretion in selecting appropriate years to establish your baseline and forecast projections.
Material cost have been influenced by multiple factors including changes in pricing formulas for
Stock Fund and DMAG process, raw materials (specialty metals) cost increases and DMAG
repair cost increases in excess of ERRB forecast.
       A3.6.1.4. Metric Interpretation: The ETOC goal is recommended by each TMS
       manager at their respective Maintenance Planning Working Group and finalized through
       coordination with the MAJCOMS.

          A3.6.2.3.5. Establish the baseline for each TMS using the 5 previous year’s data
          (initially establish using FY01 thru FY05). Use the baseline to establish the Goal for
          each TMS. Each TMS must take into consideration known workscope changes
          planned for the TMS. A standard methodology for projecting the future does not
          exist. However, outputs of the ERRB and SRRB processes should be utilized.
       A3.6.2.4. Metric Interpretation: The CPEFH goal is recommended by each TMS
       manager at their respective Maintenance Planning Working Groups and finalized through
       coordination with the MAJCOMS.
       Green: CPEFH is at or below 100% of the established goal

       Yellow: CPEFH is between 100% and 115% of the established goal

       Red: CPEFH exceeds 115% of the established goal.
