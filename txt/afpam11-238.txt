                                                 Introduction

The Aircrew Quick Reference Guide to the METAR and TAF Codes helps
aircrews quickly and clearly translate METAR and TAF codes into plain
language. See Attachment 1 for a list of source documents.

METAR reports are observed weather conditions while the TAF indicates
forecast conditions. Both are lines of text made up of coded data groups
separated by spaces. Some groups are not discussed because they are only
intended for use by the weather community. Differences between military
and civilian renderings of the code are discussed.

Aircrews should always check METAR and TAF reports thoroughly for all
hazards to flight safety and other elements that may affect aircraft
performance or mission accomplishment. When users have weather-related
questions, they should contact a certified US military forecaster or
MAJCOM-approved weather source for clarification. Weather briefing
requirements for USAF Aircrews are spelled out in AFI 11-202, Volume
3, General Flight Rules.

Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the
Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF Form 847,
Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the
field through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. This
publication may not be supplemented.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document includes clarifications of METAR sector visibility and
vertical visibility and removes references to runway surface conditions
(now reported via NOTAMs). It also incorporates several changes to the
TAF format, specifically: repositioning the AMD and COR modifiers for
emphasis, adding a ―prepared/disseminated‖ time group to military TAFs
(already included in civilian TAFs), reformatting of the TAF valid time
groups, noting that some civilian TAFs are valid for up to 30 hours, and
adding a ―T‖ before both maximum and minimum temperature groups in
military TAFs.

 METAR                                   Report Type

What kind of report is this?

KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290
3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984
RMK A02 SLP034

This report is a METAR (roughly translated from French as
Aviation Routine Weather Report)—a scheduled observation
normally taken between 50-59 minutes past the hour (also
referred to as a routine hourly observation). A METAR can be
distinguished from a TAF by its single date/time group.

SPECI KBLV 011715Z 25015G30KT 210V290 3SM
BR BKN015 01/M01 A2984 RMK SLP034

SPECI (Aviation Selected Special Weather Report) refers to
an unscheduled report taken when certain criteria have been
met (such as a change from VFR to IFR) and may be taken
anytime.




                               4
 METAR                     Location and Date/Time

How do I determine the location and the date and time of
issuance?

PAAQ 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290
3/8SM BKN005 03/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034

KCLK 291012Z AUTO 08009KT 2SM -RA SCT005
OVC009 M01/M01 A2999 RMK AO2

The 4-character ICAO identifier is the location; PAAQ
(Palmer Municipal) and KCLK (Clinton Regional) are the
locations/stations in these examples.

The 7-character group following the ICAO identifier is the
date and time of issuance. The first two digits are the date; the
last four digits are the coordinated universal time (UTC),
sometimes called ―zulu time.‖

In the first example, 01 is the 1st day of the month, and
1657Z is 1657 UTC. The second example takes place on the
29th day of the month at 1012 UTC.

When ICAO identifiers are not available or cannot be used, a
4-character identifier starting with KQ will be used. This
practice is normally found in a contingency environment,
where the location/identifier combination is often classified.
Consult the local weather flight for more details.

 METAR                                        AUTO/COR

What does AUTO and/or COR mean, if included?

Let’s look at the meanings of AUTO and COR separately.

KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM
R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02A
SLP034

AUTO refers to an automated observation with measurements taken
by equipment such as the domestic Automated Weather Observing
System (AWOS) or Automated Surface Observation System
(ASOS), or the Air Force’s Automated Meteorological Station
(AMS), also known as AN/FMQ-19. AO1 denotes an observation
taken by equipment lacking a precipitation type discriminator (rain
vs. snow). AO2 denotes an observation taken by standard equipment
with a full complement of sensors. A02A denotes an automated
observation augmented by a human observer. Absence of these
indicators denotes a manual report by a human observer.

KBLV 011657Z AUTO COR 25015G30KT 210V290
3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG FU BKN005 01/M01 A2984
RMK A02A SLP034 COR 1725

COR indicates a corrected observation. Disregard the previous
transmission. COR 1725 means that the correction was transmitted
at 1725Z.

 METAR                                               Wind

How do I determine the wind speed and direction?

KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290
3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984
RMK A02 SLP034

The data group followed by KT (knots) is the wind.

The first three digits are the true direction to the nearest 10
degrees from which the wind is blowing. The next two digits
are the sustained speed. If gusts are present, the next two or
three digits following the ―G” are the ―gust,‖ the maximum
wind speed in the last ten minutes.

In this example, the 25015G30KT group is the wind
direction and speed. Here, the wind is blowing from 250
degrees (true) at a sustained speed of 15 knots, gusting up to
30 knots.

Calm wind is encoded as 000000KT.

 METAR                               Wind Variability

How do I determine if the wind is varying between
directions?

KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290
3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984
RMK A02 SLP034

A wind variability group will be reported if the wind is
variable by 60 degrees or more and the speed is greater than 6
knots. This remark will contain the extremes of the wind
directions, separated by ―V.‖

In the example above, 210V290 reads, ―wind direction
varying between 210 and 290.‖

KBLV 011657Z AUTO VRB03KT 3/8SM
R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK
A02 SLP034

VRB is used (without direction extremes) when the wind speed
is less than or equal to 6 knots. In the example above,
VRB03KT reads, ―wind direction is variable at 3 knots.‖

 METAR                                             Visibility

How do I determine the prevailing visibility?

KBLV 011657Z 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM
R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK SLP034

Visibility is measured in statute miles. In this example, 3/8SM
(3/8 of a statute mile) is the prevailing visibility. Prevailing
visibility is the greatest horizontal visibility observed
throughout at least half the horizon circle, not necessarily
continuous. Surface visibility is measured at a point six feet
above ground level.

Sector visibility may be reported in the remarks section if it
differs from the prevailing visibility and is less than 3 miles,
or otherwise considered operationally significant. For sector
visibility format, see VIS remarks in Figure 2 on page 18.

BKN280 19/10 Q1011 NOSIG

Most overseas locations report visibility in meters and omit
the SM identifier. The largest reportable metric value is
9999. This value represents a visibility greater than 9000
meters (7 SM or more). The contraction CAVOK (ceiling and
visibility OK) may be used when there is no significant
weather, the visibility is 10 km or greater, and the ceilings are
greater than 5,000 ft. To convert visibility values from meters
to statute miles see Attachment 3 or the Flight Information
Handbook conversion tables.


                                9
 METAR                   Runway Visual Range, “R”

What if there is a group that begins with the letter “R?”

KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM
R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02
SLP034

Runway Visual Range (RVR) follows the visibility and begins with
the letter ―R.‖ The runway heading will follow the ―R,‖ and in this
example, ―32L‖ represents runway 32-Left (C-Center, R-Right).
The last four digits report the visibility in feet.

In this example, R32L/1000FT reads, ―runway visual range for
runway 32 Left is 1,000 ft.‖

Most overseas locations report visibility in meters and omit the FT
identifier from the RVR group. The same RVR at an overseas
location would appear as R32L/0300 and read, ―runway visual
range for 32 Left is 300 meters.‖

How would I decode the formats M0600FT or P6000FT or
R06L2000V4000FT (not in example above)?

       M0600FT            Reads, ―RVR is less than 600 feet.‖ (M =
                          less than)
       P6000FT            Reads, ―RVR is greater than 6,000 feet.‖
                          (P = greater than)
  R06L2000V4000FT         Reads, ―RVR for 6 Left is variable
                          between 2,000 and 4,000 feet.‖
                          ―V‖ indicates that the RVR is variable
                          between two thresholds.
For RVR conversion charts, see Attachment 4 or the front section of
any Instrument Approach Procedures (IAP) booklet.

 METAR                                   Type of Weather

How do I determine if there is any weather?

3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984
RMK A02 SLP034

If a weather element (precipitation or obstruction to visibility)
is observed, it will be found in the data group following the
visibility. The absence of a weather element group indicates
that no precipitation or obstruction to visibility is occurring at
the time of the observation. In this example, ―FG‖ represents
―Fog.‖

To methodically decode a weather group, look for six key
elements (depending on the phenomena, one or more may be
omitted). In order, these elements are: Intensity (symbol
preceding the code), Proximity, Descriptor, Precipitation
Description, Obscuration (other than precipitation), and
Other.

For a complete table of weather group elements and examples,
see Figure 1 on page 12, or reference Section C ―METAR and
TAF Code‖ of the Flight Information Handbook.

 METAR                                                         Clouds

How do I determine the layers of clouds?

SLP034

Each observed cloud layer is encoded in a cloud group with sky
coverage, altitude of the cloud base above ground level (AGL), and
sometimes cloud type. The first three letters of each cloud group
denote sky coverage as in the table below. In this example, BKN
indicates broken cloud coverage. To interpret the reported cloud
base, append two zeros to the value given. In this example, 005
represents the value 500 feet AGL. Finally, in augmented or manual
observations, codes for convective cloud types may be appended.
CB stands for cumulonimbus; TCU stands for towering cumulus.

If surface-based obscurations (e.g., clouds, smoke, haze) are
reported, and the lowest broken or overcast cloud base cannot be
determined, then vertical visibility in hundreds of feet determines
the ceiling. For example, VV002 represents a vertical visibility of
200 feet.

Sky coverage in eighths:
   SKC or CLR          Sky clear
        FEW            Few (Trace – 2/8)
        SCT            Scattered (3/8 – 4/8)
        BKN            * Broken (5/8 – 7/8)
        OVC            * Overcast (8/8)
* The lowest layer reported as broken or overcast constitutes a ―ceiling‖

A similar table can be found in Section C, ―METAR and TAF
Code‖, of the Flight Information Handbook.

RMK A02 SLP034

The group following the sky condition is the temperature and
dewpoint information in degrees Celsius. To convert
temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit see Attachment 2 or
the Flight Information Handbook conversion tables.

In this example, 01 is the temperature in degrees Celsius
(1ºC), and M01 is the dewpoint in degrees Celsius (-1ºC). An
―M‖ in the temperature or dewpoint field means ―minus‖
(below zero).

RMK A02 SLP034

The 5-character group beginning with A, following the
temperature/dewpoint group is the altimeter setting in inches
and hundredths of an inch of mercury (inches Hg), used in the
United States and at US airfields overseas. In this example,
A2984 represents a current altimeter setting of 29.84 inches
Hg.

EDDF 071320Z 22008KT 9999 SCT036 SCT090
BKN280 19/10 Q1011 NOSIG

The 5-character group beginning with Q, following the
temperature/dewpoint group is the altimeter setting in
hectopascals (hPa), used at most overseas locations. A
hectopascal is equivalent to a millibar (mb). In this example,
Q1011 represents a current altimeter setting of 1011 hPa or
1011 mb.

To convert altimeter settings from mb (or hPa) to inches Hg,
see Attachment 5 or the Flight Information Handbook
conversion tables.

 METAR                                           Remarks, US

What is RMK?

R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02
SLP034

In METAR reports from the United States and from overseas US
military airfields, RMK indicates the start of the Remarks section.
Remarks contain any pertinent information beyond the standard
fields provided and can be either encoded or spelled out in plain
language. For a partial listing of possible METAR remarks, see
Figure 2 on page 18. Additional abbreviations are constructed in
accordance with FAA Order 7340.1, Contractions.

In this example, the remark, SLP034, is the sea level pressure in
millibars (or hectopascals) to the nearest tenth. To decode, place a
―10‖ or ―9‖ before the first digit (use a 9 if the 3-digit value is 500
or more), and place a decimal point before the last digit. The sea
level pressure remark in the above example would read ―current sea
level pressure of 1003.4 millibars.‖

Caution: Do not confuse the METAR remarks ―5####‖ group or
―6####‖ group with the TAF ―5######‖ (turbulence) group or the
TAF ―6######‖ (icing) group. Unlike TAF code usage, METAR
―5‖ and ―6‖ group codes indicate pressure tendency and cumulative
precipitation amounts--if you need these values, contact your
weather provider for decoding instructions. See pages 28 and 29 for
more info on decoding TAF icing and turbulence forecasts.

 METAR                                              Remarks, Overseas

What is supplemental information?

Overseas (except at US military installations), METAR remarks are called
―supplemental information.‖ Supplemental information follows the
altimeter setting and uses remark codes like US remarks, as in Figure 2 on
page 18, but is not preceded by RMK.

Supplemental information can also include:
 - Recent weather elements, coded with a leading RE
 - Sea surface temperature in ºC and sea state 0-9, coded W##/S#
 - Runway state, coded as an 8-digit numerical group
 - A 2-hour forecast trend as described below

EDDF 071320Z 22008KT 9999 SCT036 SCT090 BKN280
19/10 Q1011 NOSIG

Overseas METAR forecast trend groups either start with BECMG or
TEMPO, consistent with TAF coding conventions, or they consist entirely
of NOSIG, which indicates that no significant changes in reportable
weather elements are expected during the 2 hours following the reported
observation.

METARs issued by North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) observers
have, as the last data group, a color code for ceiling and visibility data:

This report is a TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast)—a weather forecast
at an airport or military base for a specific period. A TAF is distinguished
from a METAR by its multiple date/time groups.

AMD (Amended Aerodrome Forecast) is issued because the previous
version is no longer representative of the current or expected weather. The
amended TAF supersedes the previous TAF. In the above example, AMD
1820 indicates that the forecast was amended at 1820Z. Always refer to
the date/time group at the end of the TAF to determine the most current
forecast.

AMD is also used with COR (Corrected Aerodrome Forecast) to indicate
that a TAF has been corrected. When a corrected TAF is issued, disregard
previous TAFs. In the above example, COR 1925 indicates that the
amended forecast was corrected at 1925Z. Always refer to the date/time

in these examples.

When ICAO identifiers are not available or cannot be used, a 4-
character identifier starting with KQ will be used. This is usually
in a contingency environment, and the location/identifier
combination is often classified. Consult the local weather flight for
more details.

The next two groups that follow the ICAO identifier show the
preparation/dissemination time of the TAF and the valid time of the
forecast. In the KBLV (Scott AFB) example, 051151Z shows that
the TAF was prepared/disseminated on the 5th day of the month at
1151Z. The valid time of the forecast follows as 0512/0612 and
indicates that the forecast valid time is from 1200Z on the 5th day of
the month to 1200Z on the 6th day.

Although most TAFs are forecasted for a 24-hour period, the valid
times may vary, up to a maximum of 30 hours. For example, the
TAF at KPVU (Provo Municipal) is only valid from 1200Z on the
8th day until 0600Z on the 9th day, while the TAF at KSLC (Salt
Lake City International) is valid from 1200Z on the 8th day until
1800Z on the 9th day.

Civilian and military forecasters alike encode the time and type of change
expected with TEMPO, FM, and BECMG groups.

TEMPO represents a temporary condition. In this example, TEMPO
0513/0516 1 1/2SM BR reads, ―Temporary condition between
1300Z and 1600Z on the 5th day of 1 1/2 statute mile visibility in mist.‖
Only the temporary changing conditions are included in TEMPO groups.

FM means ―from‖ and indicates a rapid weather change where all data
groups in the previous line are superseded. In this example, FM051600
reads, ―From 1600Z on the 5th day…‖.

BECMG means ―becoming‖ or a ―gradual change‖ in meteorological
conditions and becomes the predominant group by the end time listed.
In this example, BECMG 0522/0524 reads ―Becoming from 2200Z to
2400Z on the 5th day.‖

PROB40 (civilian use only) represents a 40% probability or chance of
conditions occurring along with associated weather conditions (wind,
visibility, sky conditions).

In this example, PROB40 0600/0606 2SM TSRA 0VCOO8CB reads,
―40% chance between 0000Z and 0600Z on the 6th day of visibility 2
statute miles in moderate thunderstorms, 800 overcast cumulonimbus
clouds.‖

The data group after the valid time and followed by KT (knots) is
the forecast wind speed.

The first three digits within a wind group are the true direction to
the nearest 10 degrees from which the wind will blow. The next two
digits are the sustained speed. If gusts are forecasted, the next two
or three digits following the ―G‖ are the ―gust,‖ the maximum wind
speed in a ten-minute window.

In this example, 14005KT, 16010KT, 21015G30KT, 29008KT,
31012G22KT, and 30008KT are the wind direction and speed
groups.

In the first wind group, the wind is forecasted to blow from 140
degrees (true) at a sustained speed of 05 knots. No gust is
forecasted.

In the third wind group, the wind is forecasted to blow from 210
degrees (true) at a sustained speed of 15 knots, gusting up to 30
knots.

In the military and at most overseas locations, visibility is forecasted in
meters. The 4-character group following the wind is the forecast visibility.
In the KBLV example, 8000, 3200, 1600, 3200, and 9999 are the forecast
visibilities in meters. 9999 is the greatest value forecasted. A value of 9999
indicates a forecast visibility of greater than 9000 meters (7 statute miles or
greater). To convert visibility values from meters to statute miles, see
Attachment 3 or the Flight Information Handbook conversion tables.

Overseas locations may use the contraction ―CAVOK‖ (ceiling and visibility
OK) when there is no significant weather, the visibility is 10 km or greater,
and the ceilings are greater than 5,000 ft.

The weather data group (forecast precipitation or obstruction to
visibility) follows the visibility data group.

In this example, BR means ―mist,‖ -SHRA means ―light rain
showers,‖ TSRA means a ―thunderstorm with moderate rain,‖ and
-RA means ―light rain.‖ NSW (no significant weather) is used to
indicate that the weather or obscuration listed in the previous group
is no longer expected to occur. Absence of a weather or obscuration
group means that no weather or obscuration is expected during the
forecast period.

To methodically decode a weather group, look for six key elements
(depending on the phenomena, one or more may be omitted). In
order, these elements are: Intensity (symbol preceding the code),
Proximity, Descriptor, Precipitation Description, Obscuration
(other than precipitation) and Other.

For a complete table of weather group elements and examples, see
Figure 1 on page 12, or reference Section C, ―METAR and TAF
Code‖, of the Flight Information Handbook.

Cloud height is forecasted in hundreds of feet. Add two zeros to the end of
the value given. In this example, FEW030, BKN008CB, OVC020, and
SKC represent the values 3,000 few, 800 broken cumulonimbus, 2,000
overcast, and sky clear. Overseas locations may use the contraction
CAVOK (ceiling and visibility OK) when there is no significant weather,
the visibility is 10 km or greater, and the ceilings are greater than 5,000 ft.

In place of cloud layers, vertical visibility in hundreds of feet will appear
in a TAF cloud group when the sky is forecast to be totally obscured. For
example, VV002 represents a vertical visibility of 200 feet. Vertical
visibility in a TAF represents the forecast ceiling.

When a surface-based partial obscuration is forecasted, it will be encoded
as FEW000, SCT000, or BKN000 in the cloud layer area. A remark will
appear after the altimeter that will describe the phenomena responsible.
For example, FG SCT000 would indicate the weather element causing the
obscuration is caused by fog and the layer amount is SCT. Surface-based
partial obscurations will not be considered a ceiling.
Sky coverage (eighths):
   SKC or CLR           Sky clear

       OVC              * Overcast (8/8)
* The lowest layer reported as broken or overcast constitutes a ―ceiling‖
A similar table can be found in Section C, ―METAR and TAF Code‖, of
the Flight Information Handbook.

A wind shear group is included if non-convective low-level winds
(up to 2,000 feet) will change in speed and/or direction and result in
a shearing action. WS indicates forecast wind shear and is followed
by a 3-digit height in hundreds of feet AGL, a slant character, ‖/,‖
and forecast wind at the height indicated. WS010/18040KT reads,
―forecast wind shear at 1,000 feet above the station; wind at 1,000
feet is from 180 degrees (true) at 40 knots.‖

The remark WSCONDS is used to indicate the potential for wind
shear when there is not enough information available to reliably
predict the height, direction and speed of the wind shear. WSCONDS
is normally used beyond the first 6 hours of the TAF.

For some locations, the wind shear group will follow the minimum
altimeter setting group (in the TAF remarks) instead of following
the cloud group.

If forecasted, the icing group will be prefixed by the number 6, and follows
the cloud group. To decode, follow these instructions:
1. Find the icing designator ―6‖ following the cloud group (620304).
2. The next digit gives icing type and intensity (620304). See Figure 3.
3. The next three digits give the base of the icing layer in hundreds of feet
(620304).
4. The last digit provides the icing layer depth in thousands of feet
(620304), so add this value to the base height to determine the top limit
of the icing conditions.

In the above example, the icing forecast will read, ―light rime icing (in
cloud) from 3,000 to 7,000 feet.‖

If forecasted, the turbulence code will be prefixed by the number 5, and
will follow the cloud or icing group. To decode, follow these instructions:
1. Look for the turbulence designator ―5‖ that follows the cloud or icing
group (520004).
2. The next digit will determine the intensity (520004). See Figure 4.
3. The next three digits will determine the base limit of the turbulence
layer in hundreds of feet AGL (520004).
4. The last digit will determine the turbulence layer depth in thousands of
feet (520004), so add this value to the base height to determine the top
limit of the turbulence conditions.

In the above example, the turbulence forecast will read, ―occasional
moderate turbulence in clear air from the surface to 4,000 feet.‖

Forecast minimum altimeter settings are only found in military
forecasts. These are near the end of the line, beginning with QNH
(minimum) and ending with INS (inches). To convert altimeter
settings from inches Hg to hectopascals (millibars), use Attachment
4 or the Flight Information Handbook conversion tables.

In the example shown above, QNH2960INS, QNH2959INS,
QNH2958INS, QNH2952INS, and QNH2950INS are read as
minimum altimeter settings of 29.60, 29.59, 29.58, 29.52, and 29.50

Forecast temperatures for the forecast period are routinely found
only in military TAFs. They are found on the last line, following the
minimum altimeter, beginning with the designator ―T,‖ maximum
temperature first. To convert temperature units from Celsius to
Fahrenheit, use Attachment 2 or the Flight Information Handbook
conversion tables.

In this example, T08/0518Z indicates a forecast maximum
temperature of 8°C on the 5th day at 1800Z, and TM01/0611Z
indicates a forecast minimum temperature of -1°C on the 6th day at
