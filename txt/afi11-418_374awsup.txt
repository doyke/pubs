2.1.1.1. (Added) There is no SOF requirement for airlift operations per paragraph 2.1.1. An
Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup) will be available for both the 36th Airlift Squadron (36 AS)
and the 459th Airlift Squadron (459 AS) IAW Table 1 to provide oversight and management of
operational issues. The respective squadron Operations Officer is normally the squadron Ops
Sup. The Ops Sup will advise the 374 AW Command Post (374 AW/CP) when transferring Ops
Sup duties to an alternate individual who meets the criteria in paragraph 2.2.
2.3. (Added) 374 OG Standardization/Evaluation (374 OG/OGV) will manage the Operations
Supervision program.
2.3.1. (Added) The 36 AS and 459 AS will provide Ops Sup contact information to 374
OG/OGV no later than the tenth day of each month. Deployed units may submit their
information for the length of the deployment. 374 OG/OGV will submit a monthly Ops Sup
roster to 374 AW/CP no later than the tenth day of each month, or as required due to personnel
changes (changes of command, TDY, leave, etc.).
2.3.2. (Added) Units will use the remarks section of the 374 OG Operations Supervision roster
to annotate changes in availability. Any changes made outside normal duty hours should be
coordinated with the 374 AW Command Post (CP).
2.3.3. (Added) If any personnel for whom 374 AW/CP does not maintain a home phone
number (e.g., Someone other than the OG/CC, OG/CD, Sq/CC, or Sq/DO) is designated as an
Operations Supervisor, the applicable unit will ensure that 374 AW/CP has access to their home
phone.
2.3.4. (Added) 374 OG/OGV will maintain a 374 OG Ops Sup program continuity book.
Contents will include current rosters, Read File items, and Ops Sup deficiencies. 374 OG/OGV
will review items contained in the 374 OG/OGV Ops Sup Continuity book quarterly for
relevance.
4.4.2.1. (Added) Ops Sups will be available through Command Post via mobile phone and
land line. During normal duty hours, the Ops Sups have the immediate capability to
communicate with Yokota-assigned aircraft operating in the local flying area through squadron
UHF radios. Operations supervisors needing to directly communicate with a squadron aircraft
during non duty hours will relay all information through Command Post until they arrive at the
squadron to utilize the squadron UHF radio.
8.2.1. (Added) The unit operations complex for both the 36 AS and the 459 AS includes each
squadron’s respective ops center area (Bldg 602 and 702), as well as the Operations Group
building (Bldg 703).
8.3.1. (Added) The respective Ops Sup will ensure the 374 OG/CC is aware of all FCFs. The
respective Ops Sup will advise the 374 OG/CC of all initial FCF takeoffs and landings when
practical. The Ops Sup will be immediately available via land line or cell phone during all FCFs.
8.6.1. (Added) Operational supervision over deployed packages will be provided through
direct contact between the Ops Sup and the appropriate deployed commander – aircraft
commander, mission commander, or detachment commander. Crews may contact home station
or deployed supervision via UHF/HF phone patch, land line telephone, global cell phones, or
Iridium satellite phones during deployed operations.

8.6.2. (Added) For deployments overseen by expeditionary squadron commanders or higher,
operational supervision will be established within the deployed force and IAW this instruction.
8.7.1. (Added) During duty hours, the Ops Sup will be contacted through the 374 AW/CP,
who will first attempt contact via the squadron duty desk. If successful contact is still not
established, 374 AW/CP will utilize the Ops Sup Roster, attempting contact with the alternate
Ops Sup or the squadron commander, in that order.
8.7.2. (Added) During non-duty hours, the Ops Sup will be contacted through the 374 AW/CP
to avoid breaking crew rest. If the 374 AW/CP is unable to contact the Ops Sup for any reason,
they will contact the alternate Ops Sup or the squadron commander (SQ/CC), in that order.
8.7.3. (Added) Ops Sups must ensure they are reachable at all times. If activity or location
precludes contact by normal means (physical activity, poor cell phone reception, etc.) the Ops
Sup will notify 374 AW/CP of new location with alternate contact number (i.e., base gym,
swimming pool, etc.) or temporarily pass duties to the alternate Ops Sup while out of contact.
8.7.4. (Added) If the 374 AW/CP is unable to contact any of the squadron Top 3, they will
contact the 374 OG/CC.
8.8.1. (Added) The CONFERENCE HOTEL-capable frequency at Yokota Air Base is UHF
325.8 (Fuji Control). Yokota Command Post will coordinate home base/command or
contractor/depot assistance (CONFERENCE HOTEL) as outlined in Attachment 4. Upon
initiation of a CONFERENCE HOTEL, 374 AW/CP will run a quick reaction checklist to notify
374 AW/CC, 374 OG/CC, 374 OG/OGV, 374 MXG/MOC, and 374 OSS/OSW. Command Post
will relay: aircraft type, call sign, mission number, tail number, fuel onboard, number of souls
on board, an account of the situation, an account of the actions taken, an account of the aircraft
commander’s intentions, and any additional pertinent information.
8.9.1. (Added) Ops Sups will report any program or equipment deficiencies to 374 OG/OGV.
374 OG/OGV will document all deficiencies in the 374 OG Ops Sup Continuity book and submit
Squadron Read File items for corrective actions if required. Squadron leadership will maintain
responsibility for maintenance of squadron-owned equipment essential to the Ops Sup program
(UHF radios, cell phones, LMRs, etc.). If any such equipment becomes unusable, squadron
leadership will acquire a suitable substitute until the equipment is repaired.
8.10.3. (Added) There are no upgrade programs, currencies, crew rest requirements, or duty
day restrictions applicable to the 374 OG Operations Supervision program.
