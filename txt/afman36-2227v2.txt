               M60 OR M240B MEDIUM MACHINE GUN TRAINING PROGRAM

1.1. M60 or M240B Machine Gun Air Force Qualification Courses (AFQC). These courses provide
Air Force members with the minimum training, evaluations and the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
(TTPs) required to ensure the gunners ability to tactically employ either the M60 or M240B Machine
Guns. If Crew Served Machine Gunner training is required at their next duty station, personnel qualified
to the Individual Machine Gunner standard during the Security Forces Apprentice Course only need to
complete the training (classroom and live-fire) to meet the Crew-Served Machine Gunner standard (this
training would not extend the qualification expiration date).
    1.1.1. Individual Machine Gunner. A machine gunner qualified to tactically employ the M60 or
    M240B in the bipod mode (from 300 to 800 meters), when vehicle mounted and has met the training
    requirements mandated within this AFMAN.
    1.1.2. Crew-Served Machine Gunner. A machine gunner qualified to tactically employ the M60 or
    M240B in all modes with the aid of an assistant gunner and has met the training requirements man-
    dated within this AFMAN. Assistant machine gunners must complete the same training program and
    meet the same qualification standards as primary machine gunners. All Security Forces personnel
    trained on the M60 or M240B will be trained to the Crew Served Machine Gunner standard. Personnel
    trained for the purpose of mobility should be trained to the Crew Served Machine Gunner Standard.

1.2. Training Overview:
    1.2.1. Initial Machine Gunner Qualification. This is the trainee’s first participation in the M60 or
    M240B Individual Qualification Training Program. Initial training consists of classroom instruction,
    qualification on the required evaluation phases of AFQC, and passing the performance tests. Since
    full distance (AFQC/FD) training is desired, the use of 10-meter initial qualification should only be
    used as a last resort. However, MAJCOM Functionals may grant individual bases permission to qual-
    ify personnel using Figure 1.2. as an initial 10-meter course (AFQC/10M) when full distance range
    facilities cannot be used. The installation commander may grant permission to qualify personnel using
    Figure 1.2. as an initial 10-meter course (AFQC/10M) for personnel attending technical training
    courses at Lackland AFB when full distance ranges cannot be used. The AF Form 522, USAF Ground
    Weapons Training Data, will reflect a 12-month qualification.
    1.2.2. Live-fire Recurring Training -- 12-Month. This is qualification training after initial qualifica-
    tion. It consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the required evaluation phases of the AFQC
    (Full Distance or 10-Meter) and passing the performance evaluations. Since full distance (AFQC/
    FD) training is desired, the use of 10-meter recurring qualification should only be used as a last
    resort. However, MAJCOM Functionals may grant individual bases permission to qualify per-
    sonnel using Figure 1.2. as a recurring 10-meter course (AFQC/10M) when full distance range
    facilities cannot be used. This evaluation is mandatory on an annual basis for all machine gunners.
    Non Security Forces personnel moving from individual to crew served status must meet all the
    requirements as mandated in this AFMAN. The AF Form 522 will reflect a 12-month qualification.
    1.2.3. Remedial Training. This is the minimum training needed to correct deficiencies causing an
    individual to fail an evaluation.
AFMAN36-2227V2 1 JANUARY 2004                                                                             5


   1.2.4. Performance Evaluation. Performance evaluations, located in lesson plans, require weapon
   operator skills certification. Evaluation is mandatory during initial and recurring training for individ-
   ual and crew-served personnel.

1.3. Instructor Guidelines.
   1.3.1. Classroom. Instructors will help trainees during portions of training techniques requiring phys-
   ical handling of weapons. They will supervise, evaluate, conduct performance evaluations and assist
   trainees during operator maintenance (care and cleaning). See AFI 36-2226, The Combat Arms Pro-
   gram, for student to instructor ratios.
   1.3.2. Range. Instructors will supervise, assist, coach and teach the tactics, techniques and procedures
   during prefire set-up, practice and evaluation phases of fire. Each firing point instructor conducts the
   course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point. To ensure safe range operations,
   close communication is essential between the range safety instructor and all point instructors. See AFI
   36-2226 for student to instructor ratios.
   1.3.3. Range Safety Instructor/Tower Operator. This instructor monitors all firing points and has
   responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.
   This individual may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the range.
   NOTE: This position is in addition to each firing point instructor. The Range Safety Instructor
   may not simultaneously serve as a firing point instructor or complete live-fire, unless relieved of
   Range Safety Instructor Duties. See AFI 36-2226 for exceptions.

1.4. M60 or M240B Machine Guns Qualification: Plan of Instruction. The plan in Table 1.1. is
intended to provide instruction standardization. This program is mandatory for initial and recurring qual-
ification training. Remedial training is in-depth, concentrating on known problems. Trainees must meet
and be evaluated to the performance standards of these training objectives. NOTE: Training times will
vary depending on class size, trainee experience level, range location, etc. Regional training centers/
technical training centers with large student loads may encounter increased training times exceeding the
times in Table 1.1. and may need to increase training times accordingly.

1.10. Course Information, AFQC/FD:
   1.10.1. Targets for the Course. Double "E" silhouette targets, empty 55-gallon drums, salvaged vehi-
   cles or mounds of earth can be used to represent personnel and vehicle targets.
   1.10.2. Standards:
      1.10.2.1. The entire course of fire is based on the students ability to fire a 6 to 9-round burst dur-
      ing training and is used to teach firing discipline and the tactical employment of the machine gun.
      In an actual real-world scenario, the shooter would continue to fire (sustained, rapid or cyclic)
      until the threat is eliminated.
      1.10.2.2. Initial lay on all targets is midpoint. After the initial burst, the gunner will move to the
      closest part of the target to the gunner, then moves to the farthest point from the gunner and finally
      back to the midpoint. Instructors must ensure targets are large enough to allow adequate traversing
      and/or searching with the required number of bursts. Gunners will ensure beaten zones over lap
      while firing. Gunners will not fire and make T & E adjustments at the same time. This technique
      is used for training and simulates no known threat. In real-life situations, gunners will tactically
      engage the portion of the target posing the greatest threat to themselves or the gun position.
      1.10.2.3. During qualification, once the student has fired at the required number of targets, any
      remaining ammunition will be returned to the instructor for placement back into the ammunition
      inventory. Ensure the AF Forms 522 and 710 reflect the correct number of rounds fired by the stu-
      dent.
      1.10.2.4. Qualification standards are contained in the course of fire.
      1.10.2.5. On all evaluation phases, if the beaten zone covers the target, it is considered a hit.
   1.10.3. Course Notes:
      1.10.3.1. Instructors are to teach trainees as needed during the practice phase/orders. During eval-
      uation phases, instructors will help trainees between orders of fire, as needed, correct safety
      infractions and supervise how trainees apply immediate action procedures.
      1.10.3.2. Assistant gunners will not be used for Phases I, II or V. On those courses where an assis-
      tant gunner is used, assistant gunners will give all fire corrections to the gunners (with the excep-
      tion of zero). Ensure trainees are equipped with the appropriate tripod, T&E mechanism and spare
      barrel kit. Gun crews will wear a helmet, flak vest, nomex gloves and hearing protection during all
      firing orders. Both the gunner and assistant gunner must have the protective mask and gloves on
      their person during the entire course.
      1.10.3.3. Sight corrections may be made at any time throughout the course.
      1.10.3.4. All orders in Phases I and II are fired in the bipod mode.
      1.10.3.5. On all orders, gunners will engage targets as a single gun covering the entire target.
      1.10.3.6. After completing Phase I, Order 4 and Phase II, Order 2, the firing point instructor will
      give the command “Gas, Gas, Gas” and the gun crew will immediately put the gun on safe and don
      the protective mask and gloves. Gunner will then engage the area target.
      1.10.3.7. Phase V is optional to fill mission training needs for units using or UTCs using vehicle
      mounted weapons. Implementation of this phase is at the discretion of MAJCOMs. In Phase V,
      gunners should use one area target at 300 meters with at least four double "E" silhouettes or
18                                                           AFMAN36-2227V2 1 JANUARY 2004


     55-gallon drums. Position the vehicle parallel to the firing line with the weapon pointed down
     range (perpendicular to the vehicle). When conducting moving vehicle firing, the vehicle should
     move parallel to the firing line at a speed of 3 to 5 miles per hour (mph).
     1.10.3.8. Should gunners fail to achieve a qualified score on any order, they are unqualified. How-
     ever, if refired within 30 days, gunners need only refire and qualify on those orders failed. Beyond
     30 days, gunner must refire entire course.
     1.10.3.9. AF Form 522 need only reflect qualified "Q" or unqualified "UQ" for the entire course.
     However, instructors must annotate (in the remarks block of the AF Form 522) any order the stu-
     dent fails and does not requalify during the class to ensure only the failed order is refired IAW
     paragraph 1.10.3.8. above. A numerical score is not required in the score block of AF Forms 522
     or 710.

1.11. Course Information: AFQC/10M:
     1.11.1. Targets for the Course. Use the 10-meter machine gun target for Phases I-IV (NSN
     6920-00-078-5123). Double "E" silhouette targets, empty 55-gallon drums, salvaged vehicles or
     mounds of earth can be used to represent personnel and vehicle targets for Phase V (see paragraph
     1.11.4.8. for Phase V course notes).
     1.11.2. Half-Loading: Half loading, unloading from a half-load and clearing from a half load is
     only authorized per the operator’s manual. Weapons not authorized the use of a half load will
     perform all loading operations using the full load procedures.
     1.11.3. Standards
        1.11.3.1. The entire course of fire is based on the students ability to fire a 6 to 9-round burst dur-
        ing training and is used to teach firing discipline and the tactical employment of the machine gun.
        In an actual real-world scenario, the shooter would continue to fire (sustained, rapid or cyclic)
        until the threat is eliminated.
        1.11.3.2. Initial lay on all targets is midpoint. After the initial burst, the gunner will move to the
        closest part of the target to the gunner, then moves to the farthest point from the gunner and finally
        back to the midpoint. Instructors must ensure targets are large enough to allow adequate traversing
        and/or searching with the required number of bursts. Gunners will ensure beaten zones over lap
        while firing. Gunners will not fire and make T & E adjustments at the same time. This technique
        is used for training and simulates no known threat. In real-life situations, gunners will tactically
        engage the portion of the target posing the greatest threat to themselves or the gun position.
AFMAN36-2227V2 1 JANUARY 2004                                                                           21


     1.11.3.3. During qualification, once the student has fired at the required number of targets, any
     remaining ammunition will be returned to the instructor for placement back into the ammunition
     inventory. Ensure the AF Forms 522 and 710 reflect the correct number of rounds fired by the stu-
     dent.
     1.11.3.4. Qualification standards are contained in the course of fire.
  1.11.4. Course Notes:
     1.11.4.1. Instructors are to teach trainees as needed during the practice phase/orders. During eval-
     uation phases, instructors will help trainees between orders of fire, as needed, correct safety
     infractions and supervise how trainees apply immediate action procedures.
     1.11.4.2. Assistant gunners will not be used on Phases I, II or V but are mandatory for Phases III
     and IV. The gunner must wear a helmet, flak vest and hearing protection during all firing orders.
     The gunner must also have the protective mask and gloves on his or her person during the entire
     course.
     1.11.4.3. Sight corrections and T&E adjustments (Phases III and IV) may be made at any time
     throughout the course.
     1.11.4.4. All orders in Phases I and II are fired in the bipod mode.
     1.11.4.5. Initial lay on all targets is midpoint. After the initial burst, the gunner will move to the
     closest part of the target to the gunner, then moves to the farthest point from the gunner and finally
     back to the midpoint. Instructors must ensure targets are large enough to allow adequate traversing
     and/or searching with the required number of bursts. Gunners will ensure beaten zones over lap
     while firing. Gunners will not fire and make T & E adjustments at the same time. This technique
     is used for training and simulates no known threat. In real-life situations, gunners will tactically
     engage the portion of the target posing the greatest threat to themselves or the gun position.
     1.11.4.6. After completing Phase I, Order 4 and Phase II, Order 2, the firing point instructor will
     give the command “Gas, Gas, Gas” and the gun crew will immediately put the gun on safe, don the
     protective mask and gloves and then engage the next target.
     1.11.4.7. Phase V is optional to fill mission training needs for units using or UTCs with vehicle
     mounted weapons. Implementation of this phase is at the discretion of MAJCOMs.
     1.11.4.8. If required, conduct Phase V vehicle firing using blank ammunition and the Multiple
     Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) equipped weapons and targets. Use one area target
     at 300 meters, with at least four double "E" silhouettes or 55-gallon drums. Hang MILES har-
     nesses over the targets or drums. Position the vehicle parallel to the firing line with the weapon
     pointing down range (perpendicular to the vehicle). An instructor must be available with a MILES
     reset key and radio. The instructor indicates target hits and resets MILES harnesses for each gun-
     ner. When conducting moving vehicle firing, the vehicle should move parallel to the firing line at
     a speed of 3 to 5 mph.
     1.11.4.9. Should gunners fail to achieve a qualified score on any order, they are unqualified. How-
     ever, if refired within 30 days, gunners need only to refire and qualify on those orders failed.
     Beyond 30 days, gunner must refire entire course.
     1.11.4.10. AF Form 522 need only reflect qualified "Q" or unqualified "UQ" for the entire course.
     However, instructors must annotate (in the remarks block of the AF Form 522) any order the stu-
22                                                             AFMAN36-2227V2 1 JANUARY 2004


      dent fails and does not requalify during the class to ensure only the failed order is refired IAW
      paragraph 1.11.4.9. above. A numerical score is not required in the score block of AF Forms 522
      or 710.

      Prone Position (Bipod). The gunner (right handed) assumes a prone position behind the M60
      keeping the body in line with the barrel. The hinged shoulder rest is placed on the right shoulder.
      Legs are spread a comfortable distance apart with heels down and toes pointed outward. Place left
      hand on top of the cover and grasp the pistol grip with the right hand. Maintain a firm, steady pres-
      sure down and to the rear with both hands (pull the gun down and tightly into the shoulder). Rest
      cheek lightly against the stock and left hand with shoulders level and elbows an equal distance
      apart below the receiver of the gun. Recommend sandbagging the bipod legs. NOTE: Left-handed
      firing is unauthorized during peacetime training because of the cartridge ejection pattern and loca-
      tion of cover latch.

                           MK-19 MACHINE GUN TRAINING PROGRAM

2.1. MK-19 Machine Gun Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC). This course provides the mini-
mum training, evaluation and the TTPs required to ensure the gunners ability to tactically employ the
MK-19. Assistant machine gunners must complete the same training program and meet the same qualifi-
cation standards as primary machine gunners.

2.2. Training Overview:
     2.2.1. Initial Training. This is the trainee's first participation in the MK-19 Qualification Training Pro-
     gram. Initial training consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the required evaluation phases
     of the AFQC (Figure 2.1.) and passing the performance evaluations. The AF Form 522 will reflect a
     12-month qualification.
     2.2.2. Recurring Training -- 12-Month. This is qualification training after initial qualification. It con-
     sists of classroom instruction, qualification on the required evaluation phases of the AFQC (Figure
     2.1.) and passing the performance evaluations. Evaluation is mandatory on an annual basis. The AF
     Form 522 will reflect a 12-month qualification.
     2.2.3. Mechanical Recurring Training -- 6-Month. This is weapon operator skill re-certification train-
     ing. This training consists of classroom instruction and passing all the performance evaluations. This
     evaluation is mandatory during the 6th month after initial or recurring training and should not
     be accomplished prior to the 6th month (Individual Unit Commanders may authorize early
     mechanical training to meet AEF requirements). Personnel who do not complete mechanical train-
     ing during the 6th month after live-fire qualification are unqualified until they complete the 6th month
     mechanical training. Once training is complete, the original 12-month qualification expiration date
     will be reinstated. Students will be given the performance tests and those who fail the performance
     tests will be given remedial instruction and retested.
     2.2.4. Remedial Training. This is the minimum training needed to correct deficiencies causing an
     individual to fail an evaluation.
     2.2.5. Performance Evaluations. Performance evaluations, located in lesson plans, consist of weapon
     operator skills certification. Evaluation is mandatory during initial, 12-month recurring and 6-month
     mechanical recurring training.
     2.2.6. Unit Training. To help maintain the gunner’s proficiency, units should provide refresher train-
     ing on operator skills and knowledge. Units should conduct this training before exercises and deploy-
     ments.

2.3. Instructor Guidelines:
     2.3.1. Classroom. Instructors will help trainees during portions of training requiring physical han-
     dling of weapons. They will supervise, evaluate, conduct performance evaluations and assist trainees
     during operator maintenance (care and cleaning). See AFI 36-2226 for student to instructor ratios.
     2.3.2. Range. Instructors will supervise, assist, coach and teach the tactics, techniques and procedures
     needed during prefire set-up, practice and evaluation phases of fire. Each firing point instructor con-
     ducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point. To ensure safe range

   operations, close communication is essential between the range safety instructor and all point instruc-
   tors. See AFI 36-2226 for student to instructor ratios.
   2.3.3. Range Safety Instructor/Tower Operator. This instructor monitors all firing points and has
   responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions. The
   instructor may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the range. NOTE: This
   position is in addition to each firing point instructor. The Range Safety Instructor may not simulta-
   neously serve as a firing point instructor or live-fire, unless relieved of Range Safety Instructor duties.
   See AFI 36-2226 for exceptions.

2.4. MK-19 Qualification Plan of Instruction. The plan in the following paragraphs is intended to pro-
vide instruction standardization. This program is mandatory for initial and recurring training. Remedial
training is in-depth, concentrating on known problems. Trainees must meet and be evaluated to the perfor-
mance standards of these training objectives. NOTE: Training times will vary depending on class size,
trainee experience level, range location, etc. Approximate training times for this program are:
   2.4.1. Initial training -- 30 hours.
   2.4.2. Recurring training (12 months) -- 22 hours.
   2.4.3. Mechanical Recurring training (6 months) – as needed for the student to successfully complete
   the required performance tests.
   2.4.4. Remedial training -- as needed.

2.5. Training Goal. The training goal is to instill confidence in the trainee to develop and maintain the
capability to use the MK-19 against enemy targets and maintain the weapon to the level authorized for the
operator. With the exception of operator maintenance, trainees must perform all evaluated tasks without
assistance.

2.6. Training Objectives. The training objectives required for successful completion of this program are
listed in Table 2.1.
   2.6.1. Intermediate Training Objectives. Trainees must be familiar with:
       2.6.1.1. Roles of the MK-19.
       2.6.1.2. Safety rules and procedures.

2.9. Course Information, MK-19 AFQC.
     2.9.1. Targets for the Course:
        2.9.1.1. Zero Target. Use a 3 meters by 3 meters reinforced panel or target of comparable size,
        preferably of metal construction. Example: refuse dumpster, 55-gallon drums, armor plating, etc.
32                                                                AFMAN36-2227V2 1 JANUARY 2004


        2.9.1.2. Target #1, Single Vehicle. Use a medium-size vehicle, approximately 8 meters by 3
        meters. Other material such as 55-gallon drums, large vehicle tires or aircraft tires, etc., may be
        used to simulate a single-vehicle size target.
        2.9.1.3. Target #2, Single Vehicle With Personnel. Use one vehicle-size target, 8 meters by 3
        meters, and several (7 to 10) personnel size targets. Personnel targets will be approximately 2
        meters high by 1 meter wide. Place personnel targets around the vehicle on the firing line side to
        define a 30-meter target area.
        2.9.1.4. Target #3, Line of Troops. Use several (15 to 20) personnel size targets (2 meters by 1
        meter). The size of the "Line of Troops" target area is 60 meters by 5 meters. Place targets in linear
        or semicircle configuration.
        2.9.1.5. Target #4, Vehicle Convoy. Use at least three large vehicle-size targets. The length of the
        "convoy" target area is 90 meters.
        2.9.1.6. Optional Moving Vehicle Phase Targets. This is a shoot on the move phase. A moving
        vehicle range may be superimposed on an existing range. If a separate area is used, construct tar-
        gets according to the description of target 2 through target 5. Four targets are required with dis-
        tances varying from 300 meters to 800 meters. Plainly mark the driving course where firing is
        permitted. For example, place traffic cones along the portion of the course where firing is permit-
        ted. The gunner will only fire upon the command of the instructor. The driver, assistant gunner
        (instructor) and the gunner are encouraged to work as a mobile fire team to identify targets, deter-
        mine range and identify kills or misses. If the driving course is an improved and maintained driv-
        ing surface, vehicle speed will not exceed 10 mph. If driving surface is unimproved and rough,
        vehicle speed will not exceed 5 mph. NOTE: Present range design and target configuration may
        vary from those described for this phase. Do not reconstruct or make major modifications solely
        for the purpose of this phase of fire if present range configuration meets the intent of this phase.
     2.9.2. Standards:
        2.9.2.1. Phase II. All four targets should be effectively engaged within 8 minutes. This time
        includes reloading. All four targets should have at least two hits each.
            2.9.2.1.1. Target #1. Desired minimum of two hits within the 5-meter kill radius.
            2.9.2.1.2. Target #2. Desired minimum of two hits within the 5-meter kill radius.
            2.9.2.1.3. Target #3. Desired minimum of two hits within the 15-meter casualty radius.
            2.9.2.1.4. Target #4. Desired minimum of two hits within the 15-meter casualty radius.
        2.9.2.2. Evaluation Phase III. A minimum of one hit per target within the 15-meter casualty radius
        within 5 minutes. All four targets must have at least one hit each.
        2.9.2.3. Familiarization Phase IV. Desired minimum of one hit per target within the 15-meter
        casualty radius. All four targets should have at least one hit each.
     2.9.3. Course Notes:
        2.9.3.1. Phase I through IV of the AFQC will be completed for initial training conducted at Air
        Education and Training Command (AETC) formal courses. The AETC formal course will conduct
        moving vehicle training if the designated range facility can accommodate this phase of training.
        2.9.3.2. Implementation of moving vehicle training is at the discretion of the MAJCOM.
AFMAN36-2227V2 1 JANUARY 2004                                                                           33


     2.9.3.3. If evaluation Phase III or Phase IV are used, they become an integral part of qualification
     training and gunners must meet the standards of these phases to be qualified.
     2.9.3.4. Gunners must qualify on phase III. If the gunners fail to meet the minimum standards
     they are unqualified with the weapon. Instructors may immediately refire an individual on phase
     III if a gunner failed; however, if the gunner fails to qualify after remedial training, the gunner is
     unqualified and must be totally retrained to meet all standards of 12-month recurring training.
     2.9.3.5. Instructors will not teach or coach during actual firing of the evaluation phase; however,
     the guncrew should be encouraged to work as a team for maximum effectiveness during firing and
     instructors will provide assistance between orders of fire as needed. Instructors will correct safety
     infractions and supervise the application of immediate action procedures by the guncrew if they
     experience stoppages.
     2.9.3.6. All orders of fire will be fired using training practice ammunition.
     2.9.3.7. The suppression stop on the cradle mount will be adjusted to prevent rounds from impact-
     ing closer than 310 meters to the weapon.
     2.9.3.8. Trainees will wear flak vests and helmets while firing.
     2.9.3.9. Hearing and eye protection are mandatory for all personnel on the firing line.
     2.9.3.10. During qualification, once the student has fired at the required number of targets, any
     remaining ammunition will be returned to the instructor for placement back into the ammunition
     inventory. Ensure the AF Forms 522 and 710 reflect the correct number of rounds fired by the stu-
     dent.

                              M2 MACHINE GUN TRAINING PROGRAM

3.1. M2 Machine Gun Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC). This course provides the minimum
training, evaluation and the TTPs required to ensure the gunners ability to tactically employ the M-2.
Assistant machine gunners must complete the same training program and meet the same qualification
standards as primary machine gunners.

3.2. Training Overview:
     3.2.1. Initial Training. This is the trainee's first participation in the M2 Training Program. Initial train-
     ing consists of classroom instruction, passing the performance evaluations and qualification on the
     required phases of the AFQC (Figure 3.1.). The AF Form 522 will reflect a 12-month qualification.
     3.2.2. Recurring Training -- 12-Month. This is qualification training after initial qualification. It con-
     sists of classroom instruction, passing the performance evaluations and qualification on the required
     phases of the AFQC (Figure 3.1.). Evaluation is mandatory on an annual basis. The AF Form 522 will
     reflect a 12-month qualification.
     3.2.3. Mechanical Recurring Training -- 6-Month. This is weapon operator skill re-certification train-
     ing. This training consists of classroom instruction and passing all the performance evaluations. This
     evaluation is mandatory during the 6th month after initial or recurring training and should not
     be accomplished prior to the 6th month (Individual Unit Commanders may authorize early
     mechanical training to meet AEF requirements). Personnel who do not complete mechanical train-
     ing during the 6th month after live-fire qualification are unqualified until they complete the 6th month
     mechanical training. Once training is complete, the original 12-month qualification expiration date
     will be reinstated. Students will be given the performance tests and those who fail the performance
     tests will be given remedial instruction and retested.
     3.2.4. Remedial Training. This is the minimum training needed to correct deficiencies causing an
     individual to fail an evaluation.
     3.2.5. Performance Evaluations. Performance evaluations, located in lesson plans, consist of weapon
     operator skills certification. Evaluation is mandatory during initial, 12-month and 6-month recurring
     training.
     3.2.6. Unit Training. To help maintain guncrew proficiency, units should provide refresher training on
     operator skills and knowledge. Units should conduct this training before exercises and deployments.

3.3. Instructor Guidelines:
     3.3.1. Classroom. Instructors will help trainees during portions of training requiring physical han-
     dling of weapons. They will supervise, evaluate, conduct performance evaluations and assist trainees
     during operator maintenance (care and cleaning). See AFI 36-2226 for student to instructor ratios.
     3.3.2. Range. Instructors will supervise, assist, coach and teach the tactics, techniques and procedures
     as needed during prefire set-up, practice and evaluation phases of fire. Each firing point instructor
     conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point. To ensure safe range
     operations, close communication is essential between the range safety instructor and all point instruc-
     tors. See AFI 36-2226 for student to instructor ratios.
AFMAN36-2227V2 1 JANUARY 2004                                                                              37


   3.3.3. Range Safety Instructor/Tower Operator. This instructor monitors all firing points and has
   responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions. The
   instructor may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the range. NOTE: This
   position is in addition to each firing point instructor. The Range Safety Instructor may not simulta-
   neously serve as a firing point instructor or live-fire, unless relieved of Range Safety Instructor duties.
   See AFI 36-2226 for exceptions.

3.4. M2 Qualification Plan of Instruction. The plan in the following paragraphs is intended to provide
instruction standardization. This program is mandatory for initial and recurring training. Trainees must
meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of these training objectives. NOTE: Training times
will vary depending on class size, trainee experience level, range location, etc. Approximate training
times for this program are:
   3.4.1. Initial training -- 40 hours.
   3.4.2. Recurring training (12-month) -- 32 hours.
   3.4.3. Mechanical Recurring training (6-month) -- as needed for the student to successfully complete
   the required performance tests.
   3.4.4. Remedial training -- as needed.

3.5. Training Goal. The training goal is to instill confidence in the trainee to develop and maintain the
capability to successfully use the M2 against enemy targets and maintain the weapon to the level autho-
rized for the operator. With the exception of operator maintenance, trainees must perform all evaluated
tasks without assistance.

3.6. Training Objectives. The training objectives required for successful completion of this program are
listed in Table 3.1.
   3.6.1. Intermediate Training Objectives. Trainees must be familiar with:
       3.6.1.1. Safety rules and procedures.
       3.6.1.2. Characteristics, nomenclature and types of ammunition.
       3.6.1.3. Methods of destruction.
       3.6.1.4. Stoppages and malfunctions.
       3.6.1.5. Roles of the machine gun.

3.9. Course Information, M2 AFQC.
   3.9.1. Course Targets:
       3.9.1.1. Double "E" silhouette targets, empty 55-gallon drums, salvaged vehicles or mounds of
       earth can be used to represent personnel and vehicle targets.
       3.9.1.2. Point targets should consist of three separate vehicle type targets.
       3.9.1.3. Deep targets should consist of a minimum of five targets.
       3.9.1.4. Linear with depth targets should consist of at least eight double "E" silhouette targets or
       paired 55-gallon drums.
       3.9.1.5. Area targets should consist of at least five double "E" silhouette targets or paired 55-gal-
       lon drums and arranged to form a group.
       3.9.1.6. On Phase V, designate four targets to be identified on the range cards.
       3.9.1.7. On Phase VI, conduct fire missions in random order of the targets designated on the range
       cards.
   3.9.2. Course Standards:
46                                                                 AFMAN36-2227V2 1 JANUARY 2004


        3.9.2.1. On Phase II, Order 1, if beaten zone covers target area, it is considered a hit. Gunner must
        hit three targets.
        3.9.2.2. On Phase II, Order 2, if beaten zone covers target area, it is considered a hit. Gunner must
        hit 13 targets. Initial lay on all targets is midpoint. After the initial burst, the gunner will move to
        the closest part of the target to the gunner, then moves to the farthest point from the gunner and
        finally back to the midpoint. Instructors must ensure targets are large enough to allow adequate
        traversing and/or searching with the required number of bursts. Gunners will ensure beaten zones
        over lap while firing. Gunners will not fire and make T & E adjustments at the same time. This
        technique is used for training and simulates no known threat. In real-life situations, gunners will
        tactically engage the portion of the target posing the greatest threat to themselves or the gun posi-
        tion.
        3.9.2.3. On Phase IV, if beaten zone covers target area, it is considered a hit. Gunner must have at
        least three bursts on target from a stationary position.
        3.9.2.4. On Phase VI, if beaten zone covers target area, it is considered a hit. Gunner must hit four
        targets.
     3.9.3. Course Notes:
        3.9.3.1. There are no time limits during practice phases. Instructors will observe setting headspace
        and timing, render help needed, observe rounds impacting in target areas, correct safety infrac-
        tions and supervise trainees who perform immediate action.
        3.9.3.2. Assistant gunners will be used for all orders of fire. Instructors should emphasize the
        importance of teamwork. Except for zeroing, the assistant gunner will give fire corrections to the
        gunner. Gun crews will wear helmets, flak vests and hearing protection during all firing orders.
        Both gunner and assistant gunner must have protective masks and gloves on their person during
        the entire course.
        3.9.3.3. Whenever possible, gun crews should fire 4:1 ball and tracer mix. All firing should be
        three to five round bursts; however, if assistant gunner is unable to observe beaten zone, five to
        seven round burst may be necessary. During qualification, once the student has fired at the
        required number of targets, any remaining ammunition will be returned to the instructor for place-
        ment back into the ammunition inventory. Ensure the AF Forms 522 and 710 reflect the correct
        number of rounds fired by the student.
        3.9.3.4. Sight corrections and T&E adjustments may be made at any time throughout the course.
        3.9.3.5. All phases must be fired on a full-distance range.
        3.9.3.6. On orders requiring CWDE, the guncrews will don their protective masks and gloves
        before starting the firing orders.
        3.9.3.7. Linear and deep targets will be engaged as a single gun covering the entire target.
        3.9.3.8. On Phase III and Phase IV, the vehicle may be positioned parallel with or at a right angle
        to the firing line with the weapon pointed down range.
        3.9.3.9. Phase V and Phase VI are used to train and evaluate the guncrews' ability to prepare range
        cards and engage targets using range cards. On Phase V, they will use a 100-round belt during day-
        light hours to obtain direction and readings for the targets indicated. They will have 15 minutes to
AFMAN36-2227V2 1 JANUARY 2004                                                                            47


      prepare field expedient range cards using bandoleer boxes, wooden spacers from ammunition
      crates, etc., and complete Phase V. During phase VI, gun crews will fire four fire missions using
      range cards prepared during phase V. Night vision devices, illumination rounds or flares may be
      used with night-fire training.
      3.9.3.10. In the event night fire cannot be accomplished, Phases V and VI will be conducted dur-
      ing the day.
      3.9.3.11. Do not reconstruct firing ranges for the sole purpose of complying with this course of
      fire.
      3.9.3.12. Should the gunner fail to achieve a qualifying score on any evaluation order, the gunner
      is considered unqualified. However, if refired within 30 days, gunners need only to refire and
      qualify on those orders failed. Beyond 30 days, gunner must refire entire course.
      3.9.3.13. AF Forms 522 or 710 should only reflect qualified "Q" or unqualified "UQ" for each fir-
      ing phase. A numerical score is not required in the score block of these forms.

Figure 3.2. M2 Machine Gun Prone Position.




      Prone Position. The gunner lays to the rear of the tripod and directly behind the gun. The gunner's
      legs are spread and feet are as flat as possible with toes turned outward. The left elbow may rest on
      the ground but the left hand should be placed on the T&E mechanism to allow rapid elevation and
      or traverse adjustments. The right hand is on the right spade grip and positioned to actuate the trig-
      ger. The assistant gunner's position is to the gunner's left. The assistant gunner is responsible for
      spotting targets, calling adjustments of fire to the gunner, clearing expended brass from under the
      receiver, etc.

      gunner may sit with the legs extended (or crossed) under the tripod whichever is more comfort-
      able. Elbows are on the inside of the thighs for stability. The left hand should be placed on the
      T&E mechanism to allow rapid elevation and or traverse adjustments. The right hand is on the
      right spade grip and positioned to actuate the trigger. The assistant gunner's position is to the gun-
      ner's left. The assistant gunner is responsible for spotting targets, calling adjustments of fire to the
      gunner, clearing expended brass from under the receiver, etc.
