   6.5. (Added) Procedures for Air Force Repair Enhancement Program (AFREP) assets
   are as follows:
       6.5.1. (Added) Candidates for AFREP are XB/XF items for which maintenance has
       determined a need and which can be repaired locally. Items that are Expendability,
       Recoverability, Reparability Cost Designator (ERRCD) has been approved by the
       applicable item manager or changed from XD to XF/XB. These assets either may be
       found at the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) or may be currently
       assigned DIFM details on other organization/shop code accounts. (Ref: AFI 21-123)
       6.5.2. (Added) Quarterly, the AFREP office will identify National Stock Numbers
       (NSNs) that are potential AFREP candidates and report them to Customer Support
       Liaison Element. Those expendable NSNs identified as AFREP will have an issue
       exception (IEX) code R loaded to the item record, DD Form 1348-1A will have the
       phrase/statement ―AFREP‖ on it. This will let maintenance personnel know that the
       unserviceable asset should be taken to the designated holding area in the Materiel
       Management Flight. The Materiel Management Flight will provide transportation of
       XB/XF assets from on-base repair shops to the Materiel Management Flight; however, 20
       EMS Phase Support is responsible for the movement of their XB/XF assets to the
       Materiel Management Flight.         (Ref: AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch
       11_SHAWAFBSUP1, Attachment 11A-9, Table 11A9.2, Note 11)

    6.5.3. (Added) FSC personnel are responsible for moving assets to and from AFREP.
    Use organization/shop code 490GF. Serial numbers for AFREP ISUs will be 1101-1200,
    support of the 20 CMS Supply Section. (See AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch
    11_SHAWAFBSUP1, paragraph 11.3.4.7.)
    6.5.4. (Added) Serviceable/Unserviceable Assets.
       6.5.4.1. (Added) Any unserviceable XF3 assets without a DIFM detail will be
       turned in as found on base (FOB) with TEX code A from account 490GF. Then
       process an unserviceable issue (MSI) with a TEX code D. This will provide the asset
       to maintenance as a :Free Issue‖ while establishing a DIFM detail.
       6.5.4.2. (Added) An unserviceable XF3 asset turned in with a DIFM detail will be
       placed in the designated hold area by the FSC for one duty day. If the AFREP shop
       can repair the asset, a TIN will be processed with a TEX code 1 to clear the DIFM
       detail. Once the DIFM detail is cleared, use MSI processing procedures listed in
       paragrph6.5.4.5, this supplement.
       6.5.4.3. (Added) A serviceable/unserviceable TIN will be processed after all repair
       action has been completed. If the asset is turned in unserviceable, no money will be
       awarded since the asset was originally ―Free Issued.‖ If the asset is turned in
       serviceable, then credit will be determined by the SBSS.
       6.5.4.4. (Added) While XF3 assets are under AFREP DIFM control, DIFM status
       code zero cross point (ZCP) will be assigned. This code has been established solely
       for the AFREP program. AFREP is responsible for monitoring, tracking and
       accountability for all DIFM-coded ZCP asset. (Ref: AFMAN 23-110, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch
       24_SHAWAFBSUP1, Attachment 24A2.2 and AFI 21-123_ACCSUP1, paragraph
       5.6.6)
       6.5.4.5. (Added) XB items, whether found in DRMO or on base, will be handled the
       same as they are now. Upon turn-in, credit will only be given if the credit indicator
       flag is on or if there is a local requirement for the asset.
    7.2.16. All individuals assigned as reject monitors and those designated as Degraded
    Operations Control Team members will be appointed in writing and updated as necessary
    via an appointment letter from their respective flight chief/MSL. Reject monitor
    appointment letters will be forwarded to Compliance and Analysis, 20 LRS/LGLOC, and
    the Degraded Operations Control Team member appointment letters will include name,
    rank, duty phone and office symbol, and will be forwarded to the Degraded Operations
    Control Team Chief, 20 LRS/LGRMC.
    7.3.2. Reference Attachment 3 (Added), this supplement, on assignment of J activity
    8000 series.
