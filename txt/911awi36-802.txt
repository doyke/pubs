1. Telecommuting. Telecommuting is a management tool allowing Reserve commanders or
program managers, or their written designees, to pre-authorize, in writing, personnel to work
away from their official duty location in an official capacity for pay and/or points.
Telecommuting is a complementary way of doing business, which moves work to the people
instead of moving the people to the work. In general, it means working from an alternate work
location away from the official duty location. The alternate work locations must have the
necessary tools and environment to enable the telecommuter to accomplish assigned duties. All
data, documents or products developed are the sole property of the United States Government
and will be prepared for filing in accordance with command guidance if it is to be a permanent
record.

     1.1. Telecommuting is voluntary.
     1.2. The approval authority should grant telecommuting only when it is in the best interest of
     the 911 Airlift Wing (911 AW). Telecommuting is a privilege and not a right for the
     telecommuter. Travel and per diem in connection with this type of duty are not authorized.
     1.3. Telecommuting is authorized as a method to perform Annual Tour (AT), Active Duty
     for Operational Support (ADOS), and Inactive Duty Training (IDT). Readiness Management
     Periods (RMP) are additional IDT periods that can be completed via telecommuting.
     1.4. No classified material will be used or created while telecommuting.
     1.5. The approval authority and the supervisor determine the amount of telecommuting work
     to be permitted.
Under no circumstances should a telecommuter perform all of their duties by telecommuting. It
is the intent that every Reservist participate in a military environment by performing duty in
uniform at their official duty location.

     1.6. This instruction requires that participants use a pre-authorized work agreement for
     accountability. Attachment 2 shows a sample work agreement.

        2.2.5. Maintaining the original approved work agreement with a copy to the

     2.3. The commander is responsible for approving the use of Government owned equipment
     and supplies for use by the telecommuter. The decision to use appropriated funds to pay for
     equipment, services or supplies for the purposes of telecommuting rests solely with the
     commander and cannot be delegated.

     3.2. Telecommuters are responsible for providing telecommuting equipment requirements to
