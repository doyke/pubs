1. On Wednesday, XXXXXX, members of the 442 SFS will deploy to the designated play area on the east
side of WAFB at approximately 1200. This exercise will run from approximately 1200 hours, 16 April to
approximately 1200 hours, 19 April 2001. Members will be posted in ten defensive fighting positions and
on patrols. Each defensive fighting position will be given four early warning devices (trip flares) to be
placed no less than 30 feet in front of their position. Approximately six booby traps (whistlers) will be
placed at a minimum of 50 feet in front of their positions. Members will be issued simulated hand grenade
bodies with fuses to be used during the exercise to simulate eliminating hostile threats. Members are
required to yell grenade prior to throwing the simulated grenades forward of their positions. No pyrotech-
nic will be thrown within 125 ft of personnel.
2. Evaluators will be using Signal White Star after dark as needed and upon request from members for
illumination. All notifications prior to use of pyrotechnics will be made. Evaluators will use green, red,
violet, and yellow smoke during day and night operations for concealment and upon request from patrol
leaders as signaling devices. Evaluators will also be using ground burst simulators to simulate attacks
from aggressors.
3. All members handling, transporting, and using these pyrotechnics were trained as required by 442 FW/
SEW and 509 CED/EOD on 7 September 2000.
4. Pyrotechnics will be transported in metal ammo cans and wooden boxes which will clearly identify its
contents. All munitions will be stored in their original container at the supply point and secured at all
times. Munitions will be placed on pallets with a minimum of 2A: 10 BC fire extinguishers at designated
locations within the play area to guard against grass fires. Safety briefings will be given to every member
prior to deploying into the play area emphasizing munitions and fire safety.
