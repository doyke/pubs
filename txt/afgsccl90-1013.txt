This Inspection Checklist implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 90-2, Inspector General
--The Inspection System, 26 April 2006, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 90-201, Inspector General
Activities, 17 June 2009, and AFI 90-201_AFGSCSUP, Addendum J, Unit Compliance
Inspections, 1 February 2010. This checklist reflects command requirements for OPSEC offices to
prepare for and conduct unit self-inspections. It complements Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-
701_AFGSCSUP, Operations Security (OPSEC), and implements the guidance found in AFI 90-
201, Inspector General Activities, and the AFGSC supplement to it. Effective unit self-inspections
serve as the foundation for commanders to ensure compliance with governing directives. This
supplement applies to Headquarters Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), its numbered air
forces (NAF) and their assigned wings and squadrons, AFGSC direct reporting units (DRU), and
Air National Guard (ANG) units.
