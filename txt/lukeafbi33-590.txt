        1.2.1.3. Base PECOs will perform “first look” on all outages. If an outage is
        determined to be beyond the scope of “first look,” Base PECOs will schedule repair
        action with a civilian vendor or contractor.
        1.2.1.4. The standard response time is within 3 duty days (normally same day) of the
        reported discrepancy. Priority maintenance will begin within 4 hours of the reported
        discrepancy. Priority systems are:
            1.2.1.4.1. Luke Commanders Talkgroup.
            1.2.1.4.2. Fire/Crash Talkgroup.
            1.2.1.4.3. Security Forces 1 Talkgroup.
            1.2.1.4.4. Hospital Talkgroup.
        1.2.1.5. All fixed, handheld, and mobile PWCS assets are considered routine
        maintenance items unless there are no other handheld or backup radios available.

         1.2.2.1. Unit PECs will coordinate repair or replacement of all non-AIM reportable
         assets directly with the carriers or vendors. If the item is found beyond economical
         repair, units may replace the item at their discretion as in paragraph 1.1.3.13.2. above.
         1.2.2.2. Ensure items procured are identified on the applicable vendor’s approved
         product list.

         and/or service provider is selected.
         1.3.2.2. Compare CT/PDA service bills to the unit’s PWCS inventory to ensure bills
         are paid only for approved PWCS assets.
         1.3.2.3. Perform a review of all CT/PDA billing statements to verify all PWCS calls
         are for official use only (see paragraph 1.1.4.2). Forward any irregularities
         discovered to unit commanders for resolution.
         1.3.2.4. Ensure a Luke Air Force Base GPC Purchase Request is processed through
         ADPE when any transaction results in the acquisition of a new or replacement PDA,
         regardless of the cost.
         1.3.2.5. Work with appointed PECs to establish and maintain non-AIM inventory.
      1.3.3. When other less costly, fixed, or handheld communications are readily available to
      meet mission needs, more expensive PWCS devices, such as CTs or PDAs, must not be
      used.
      1.3.4. While driving on Luke AFB, the use of a hands-free vehicle adapter system is the
      only authorized method of PWCS operation. When not available, drivers must pull off to
      the side of the road while operating PWCS to avoid mishaps.

Terms
AIM—A computer database management system used to track assets, maintenance schedules,
specific maintenance actions, and expenditures for inventory and budget control.
AIM—Reportable Assets—LMRs, and associated equipment costing $500 or more, unless it is
a CT/PDA with a Controlled Cryptographic Item (CCI) module/attachment.
Fair wear and tear—Damage caused through the normal course of the asset’s intended use.
“First Look”—Initial troubleshooting that may require Base PWCS personnel to resolve the
problem by resetting or reprogramming, and, if spare equipment is available, providing a
temporary loaner PWCS asset while broken equipment is sent to a vendor or contractor for
repair.
Fixed asset—A dispatch console, consolette, or desktop remoted to a consolette.
Logistics Support Plan—previously called the Replacement Plan: a document, based on repair
history, supportability, and obsolescence, periodically generated by Base PECOs that
recommends to owning organizations the replacement of PWCS resources.
Mobile asset—An LMR mounted in a vehicle.
Non—AIM Reportable Assets—CTs, PDAs that do not access 56 FW infrastructure, and other
communication devices costing less than $500.00, unless they are equipped with CCI
modules/attachments.
Talkgroup—A collection of radios configured to operate on one channel.
Technical solutions—Recommendations to solve PWCS related problems to include types of
equipment to order.
