This instruction prescribes the policy for the use of Air National Guard (ANG) airlift resources and imple-
ments the Air National Guard's Mission Readiness Airlift (MRA) program. It gives guidance on the stan-
dard process for requesting ANG Operational Support Airlift (OSA), airlift for training from the ANG
MRA Program and Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT). This instruction provides the
user community with a single source of information on the entire ANG airlift system.
This instruction applies to the ANG, Army National Guard (ARNG), and potential users. It is primarily
aimed at logistics and scheduling offices in the ANG and ARNG field units. This regulation augments and
expands on information contained in Department of Defense (DoD) 4515.13-R, Air Transportation Eligi-
bility, DoD Directive 4500.56, DoD policy on the Use of Government Aircraft and Air Travel and ANG
Instruction (ANGI) 10-207, Global Flight Following. It does not replace those references. The proponent
agency for this instruction is the ANG Operational Plans and Execution Division (NGB/A3X). Users are
invited to send comments and suggested improvements on Air Force (AF) Information Management Tool
(IMT) 847, Recommended Changes to Publications, directly to Air National Guard, Operational Plans
and Execution Division (NGB/A3X), 3500 Fetchet Avenue, Andrews AFB, MD 20762-5157.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This revision realigns ANG
transportation policy to echo DoD and United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) guid-
ance (Chapter 1). It updates the policy and procedures used within the MRA Program (Chapter 2 and
Chapter 3). Specifies current procedures for flight operations while flying under MRA (Chapter 4). Pro-
vides guidance to users interested in ANG Operational Support Airlift (OSA) travel (Chapter 5). Pro-
vides guidance on ANG airlift support of JA/ATT requirements (Chapter 6).

                                               Chapter 1

                 TRANSPORTATION POLICIES FOR USE OF ANG AIRCRAFT

1.1. Purpose. This section outlines transportation policy and the management of military airlift resources
possessed by the ANG.

1.2. Joint Doctrine - Transportation. The Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) outlines transporta-
tion doctrine and guidance in Joint Publication 4-01, Joint Doctrine for the Defense Transportation Sys-
tem.
    1.2.1. The Defense Transportation System (DTS) is that portion of the nation's transportation infra-
    structure, which supports the DoD common-user transportation needs across the range of military
    operations. The ANG does not fall under the DTS.
       1.2.1.1. Transportation procedures and responsibilities should be the same for peacetime and war-
       time. This standardization allows transportation forces to train during times of peace in the same
       manner in which they would operate during war or a contingency and provides flexibility to effec-
       tively and quickly support any type of military operation.
    1.2.2. The foundation for transportation policy is based on two statutes of United States Code (USC).
       1.2.2.1. USC, Title 31, Section 1344, Passenger Carrier Use, states that vehicles and aircraft of
       any United States (US) Government agency may only be used for official purposes.
       1.2.2.2. USC, Title 31, Section 1301, Anti-Deficiency Act, states that appropriated funds may
       only be used for the purposes intended, i.e., DoD resources specifically may only be used to sup-
       port DoD mission training requirements.
    1.2.3. The CJCS assigns movement priorities in support of DoD components based upon capabilities
    reported by USTRANSCOM and adjudicates competing lift requirements.

1.3. DoD Transportation Policy. The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) has designated the Commander,
US Transportation Command as the DoD single manager for transportation (other than for Service-unique
and theater assigned assets) during times of peace and war.
    1.3.1. Department of Defense policy concerning the purposes on which DoD owned or controlled air-
    craft can be used is set forth in DoD Directive (DoDD) 4500.56, DoD Policy on the Use of Govern-
    ment Aircraft and Air Travel.
       1.3.1.1. DoDD 4500.56 specifies that within the Continental United States (CONUS), commer-
       cial transportation services shall be the normal method used for official passenger movement
       including travel for attending conferences, meetings, ceremonies, giving speeches, site visits, etc.
       Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS), commercial air transportation shall be used in
       accordance with the Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR) Volume 1, Uniformed Service Mem-
       bers, and the Joint Travel Regulation (JTR), Volume 2, Department of Defense Civilian Person-
       nel, and travel is funded by the user's organization.
    1.3.2. USTRANSCOM J3/J4 Division manages the Joint Operational Support Airlift Center
    (JOSAC) who has been designated by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) as the executive
    agent for military air (MilAir) travel within the CONUS for official business.
ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007                                                                                5


      1.3.2.1. The National Guard will establish specific agreements identifying those specific OSA air-
      craft that will provide availability to JOSAC for CONUS scheduling. Contact info as follows:
      https://josac.transcom.mil/ or call 576 2824/1768.
      1.3.2.2. Within the National Guard, each state is responsible to train at least one requestor/valida-
      tor on the Joint Air Logistics Information System (JALIS) computer program.
      1.3.2.3. National Guard customers interested in using OSA aircraft for official travel within the
      CONUS must process their request through their state validator who will interface with JOSAC.
      1.3.2.4. National Guard customers interested in using ANG OSA aircraft for official travel OCO-
      NUS must process their request through the Chief, National Guard Bureau (NGB), Executive
      Travel Coordinator (NGB-ZAS). Follow the procedures listed in Chapter 5. Active Component
      customers interested in using ANG OSA aircraft for official travel OCONUS must provide an
      authorized and validated request to ANG Operational Plans and Execution Branch (NGB/A3XE)
      and NGB-ZAS. Follow the procedures listed in Chapter 5. All requests for OCONUS travel will
      be subject to prioritization and will be determined on ANG ability to fund or the users ability to
      fund.
   1.3.3. The DoD policy for passenger transportation eligibility on DoD owned or controlled aircraft is
   set forth in DoD 4515.13-R.
      1.3.3.1. DoD 4515.13-R delineates who is eligible for DoD transportation and under what circum-
      stance they may travel on DoD assets. If a passenger's eligibility is not specifically addressed, then
      the passenger must procure an approval. Applicant may seek approval or a waiver pursuant to
      Assistant Deputy under Secretary of Defense (Transportation Policy) procedures.
      1.3.3.2. It is DoD policy that commanders at all levels exercise prudent judgment to ensure that
      only authorized traffic is transported and that they do not misuse the authority delegated to them.
      All officials responding to requests for transportation not specifically authorized by DoD
      4515.13-R shall make no commitments concerning prospective travelers or cargo until the poten-
      tial user obtains all required approvals and the flying unit must then obtain the required ANG
      approval.

1.4. Passenger/Cargo Eligibility Options Outside Standard Channels.
   1.4.1. The DoD is prohibited by law from providing airlift for any non DoD activity unless it is: (1)
   of an immediate emergency/lifesaving nature, (2) in direct support of the DoD mission, (3) specifi-
   cally authorized by statute, or (4) it is requested by the head of an executive agency of the federal gov-
   ernment.
      1.4.1.1. The Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Transportation Policy (ADUSD/
      TP) is the approving authority for transportation requests pursuant to the Economy Act.
      1.4.1.2. Detailed information on the airlift approval process pursuant to this section may be
      obtained at http://www.acq.osd.mil/log/tp/. Click on "Airlift Policy and Issues" and then Click
      on “Military Air Request”.

1.5. United States Air Force (USAF) and Air Mobility Command (AMC) Transportation Policy.
   1.5.1. AMC is the USAF Major Command (MAJCOM) under USTRANSCOM. Most of the ANG
   airlift and air refueling units are AMC gained with the exception of: 156th Airlift Wing (AW), Muniz
6                                                                   ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007


    ANGB, PR is Air Combat Command (ACC) gained; 154th Wing, Hickam AFB, HI; 168th Air Refu-
    eling Wing, Eielson AFB, AK; and 176th Wing, Kulis ANGB, AK, are Pacific Command Air Forces
    (PACAF) gained; and 189th AW, Little Rock AFB, AR, is Air Education Training Command (AETC)
    gained.
    1.5.2. AMC as the air component to USTRANSCOM may authorize ANG units to fly missions under
    the DTS. AMC provides flying hour reimbursement, Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) days
    and travel dollars to ANG units when flying AMC Transportation Working Capital Funds (TWCF)
    missions.
       1.5.2.1. AMC will provide the unit with an AMC mission number and mission symbol for each
       mission flown. This AMC mission number and mission symbol are used for both flight following
       and funding purposes. ANG flying units will ensure that the correct mission symbol is issued to
       ensure proper funding and flight hour reimbursement. AMC mission number guidance can be
       found within the AMC encode/decode tables. ANG units will obtain an ANG mission number for
       administrative accounting purposes within the ANG. Contact NGB/A3E for mission symbol
       inquiries DSN: 278-8965.
    1.5.3. The ANG will utilize current command and control systems for mission planning and tracking
    purposes. The primary tracking systems will be GDSS II and Single Mobility System (SMS).
       1.5.3.1. GDSS II information can be obtained at https://gdss2support.scott.af.mil.
       1.5.3.2. SMS information can be obtained at: http://SMS.Transcom.mil.

1.6. National Guard Bureau (NGB) Transportation Policy.
    1.6.1. It is NGB policy to comply with DoD policy concerning the use of ANG organic airlift assets
    for transportation. Organic airlift is defined as military aircraft whose primary mission is other than
    carrying passengers but has the capability to carry passengers.
    1.6.2. Each state’s Adjutant General (TAG) will ensure that aircraft are used for official business
    only. ANG unit commanders and ultimately the State AG’s are responsible for authorizing flights
    involving ANG aircraft IAW all applicable transportation regulations, laws and polices.
    1.6.3. National Guard Support to Other DoD Components. ANG units receive many requests from
    other DoD components to move personnel and cargo to meet mission requirements. National Guard
    units are not authorized to schedule movement of these loads until the user presents approval (valida-
    tion) from USTRANSCOM. The user is responsible to obtain cargo/passenger validation from
    USTRANSCOM through their command channels. ANG units are not authorized to support contin-
    gency airlift missions utilizing appropriated training flying hours and funding. Wing leadership will
    ensure proper use and management of all appropriated funding, to include flight hour usage.
    1.6.4. National Guard Support to External Customers. National Guard units also receive many
    requests from organizations either within the Federal Government external to DoD or from organiza-
    tions external to the Federal Government. The National Guard does not have the authority to approve
    these airlift requests. In addition, the National Guard cannot promise or provide airlift until the cus-
    tomer obtains cargo/passenger validation approval processes described in Paragraph 1.4. National
    Guard units are directed not to offer any indication that airlift is possible based on future approvals.
    Any support authorized should include full reimbursement of flying hours, per diem and man days via
    requestor provided fund sites.

   1.6.5. Authorized missions in direct support of the Federal military mission. Types of missions
   included in this category are:
       1.6.5.1. Support of ANG and ARNG military training and military activities.(See Chapter 2).
       1.6.5.2. Support of the active or reserve components of the DoD.
       1.6.5.3. ANG military training (aviation unit or individual aircrew training).
       1.6.5.4. Operational support airlift for designated OSA units.
   1.6.6. Authorized missions in direct support of the State military mission. The Governor has been del-
   egated certain responsibilities with regard to the National Guard, and is empowered to employ ANG
   aircraft in State emergencies, even when the personnel using these aircraft are on State active duty and
   under the command of the Governor pursuant to State law. ANGI 10-8101, Military Support to Civil
   Authorities, provides further guidance on the use of ANG aircraft under State active duty. The types
   of missions included in this category are:
       1.6.6.1. Disaster relief operations.
       1.6.6.2. State-declared emergency operations.
       1.6.6.3. Civil disturbance operations.
NOTE: Flights to determine if an emergency exists may be conducted as support of the State military
mission.
   1.6.7. ANG training missions must use aircrew training hours in a manner that demonstrates good
   stewardship of appropriated funding. The ANG justifies these hours on the basis of maintaining war-
   time readiness. Each training mission must be structured to achieve maximum training. Any by-prod-
   uct airlift opportunity resulting from a previously scheduled training mission must not degrade the
   intended training in any way and must comply with applicable DoD directives and regulations. It is
   essential that personnel at all levels prevent misuse of air mobility resources as well as the perception
   of their misuse. It is important the travel is done in conjunction with already scheduled training rather
   than "training" missions being flown primarily for their transportation by-product. Flying hours flown
   should not exceed those required to meet legitimate training requirements.
   1.6.8. The Mission Readiness Airlift (MRA) Program was established by the National Guard Bureau
   to utilize the available capacity on ANG aircraft to support combat readiness training requirements
   while providing aircrew training.
       1.6.8.1. The MRA program attempts to match aircrew off-station training requirements with
       National Guard customers seeking point-to-point transportation to meet combat readiness training
       requirements. The MRA program is not a guaranteed source for point-to-point transportation.
       National Guard customers planning to use MRA must be fully prepared to fund and source alter-
       nate means of transportation to complete their training requirements.
   1.6.9. Travel for Operational Readiness Inspections (ORIs). Units may request transportation to
   ORIs under the MRA program IAW approved standard package requirements. Requests must meet
   the minimum MRA standard described in Paragraph 2.4. Unit requests that do not meet MRA mini-
   mum qualifications should make arrangements to travel by commercial transportation or apply for
   military OSA through the JOSAC system (See Paragraph 1.3.2.). Since the MRA program is not a
8                                                                    ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007


    guaranteed point-to-point transportation program, units must be prepared to secure transportation
    through alternate means.

1.7. Non Standard Airlift Requests, Travel for Conferences, Conventions, Staff Assistance Visits,
Meetings, and/or MWR Events. Travel for conferences, conventions, staff assistance visits, meetings,
and/or MWR events by any size of group, whether the event is sponsored by the National Guard or not,
does not qualify as combat readiness training under the MRA program and training missions will not be
scheduled solely to support this type of transportation requirement. It may qualify as opportune airlift
(Priority 6, Paragraph 2.5.6.), which means that it may only be supported in conjunction with already val-
idated and scheduled training without adding additional cost to the government. Personnel seeking trans-
portation for this purpose are advised not to rely on opportune airlift as their primary means of travel
because requests may not be filled and the supporting air wings are not responsible for mission cancella-
tions . Users are encouraged to travel by commercial transportation or apply for OSA transport through
JOSAC. (See Paragraph 1.3.2.).
    1.7.1. It is possible to travel to such events if it takes place in conjunction with already scheduled
    training missions. Training missions scheduled to transport National Guard members to non-mission
    readiness training events such as conferences, conventions, meetings, or MWR events are prohibited.
    Space available or opportune travel on training missions is only permitted if:
       1.7.1.1. The aircraft is already scheduled for an official purpose.
       1.7.1.2. Travel is on a non-interference basis.
       1.7.1.3. The non-interference travel does not require a larger aircraft than needed for the official
       purpose.
       1.7.1.4. Already scheduled official travelers or cargo is not displaced.
       1.7.1.5. The travel results in negligible additional cost to the Government. Such travel is funded
       by the aircraft operator's organization..

1.8. Emergency Response Airlift (ERA). Airlift requirements in response to natural and or man-made
disasters that require immediate response will be managed by the ANG Crisis Action Team (CAT). Spe-
cific policies and guidance will be issued to the field and based upon event requirements. CAT POC:
DSN: 278-7484/7243/7166, Commercial: 301-836-7484/7243/7166, email: ang.cat.airlift@ang.af.mil.

1.9. Transportation of mobilized Airmen/Soldiers in Title 10 status. In general, current guidelines
prohibit the use of appropriated training funds to solely support the generation of aircraft for the transpor-
tation of mobilized members in Title 10 status. Transportation requests for National Guard mobilized
members in Title 10 status will adhere to all applicable regulation, law, and policy. Refer to https://
xox.ang.af.mil for current policy letters.

                   ANG MISSION READINESS AIRLIFT (MRA) PROGRAM

2.1. Purpose. This section identifies the NGB policy for the management of ANG airlift resources in
support of combat readiness training and identifies the policy and procedures for the management of the
MRA Program.
   2.1.1. Concept. The MRA program supports the Chief, NGB mission of providing trained and ready
   combat forces. National Guard personnel and equipment will be authorized ANG MRA support when
   valid combat readiness training requirement exists.
   2.1.2. MRA is authorized only for National Guard personnel and cargo requiring transportation to
   meet combat readiness training requirements not externally funded. The DTS manager,
   USTRANSCOM validates all other organizations or groups external to the National Guard seeking
   transportation.
       2.1.2.1. National Guard personnel and cargo deploying to support real-world contingencies or
       Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) exercises are directed to procure transportation through the Joint Oper-
       ations Planning and Execution System (JOPES) unless an MOA has been established. MAJCOM
       seeking ANG support for JCS and COCOM exercises will supply ANG with source of funding to
       include flight hours unless an MOA has been established.
   2.1.3. MRA is a by-product of flying training events and is used to achieve combat readiness training
   of both aircrew and the supported unit. Safety is a prime consideration during all National Guard air-
   lift missions. ANG flying units will perform MRA missions in accordance with applicable command
   directives and provisions of this instruction.
       2.1.3.1. MRA provides aircrews with actual loads, unfamiliar operating locations, OCONUS
       requirements, which add realism to training and provides practical experience for aircrews.
   2.1.4. The Chief, NGB, through NGB/A3XE, allocates missions to the flying units who exercise
   operational authority over their participating aircraft.
       2.1.4.1. NGB/A3XE is the OPR who compiles validated MRA requirements and matches them
       with ANG flying unit availability through interface with flying unit training and scheduling sec-
       tions. NGB/A3XE will base validation upon meeting published MRA criteria and the availability
       of fiscal year funding. NGB/A3XE retains the right to cancel, deny, or alter previously validated
       MRA missions if funding is determined to no longer be available.
       2.1.4.2. National Guard units requesting MRA must be prepared to obtain transportation from
       other sources. Validated MRA requests regularly exceed the off-station flying training require-
       ments of the ANG flying units.
   2.1.5. All MRA missions involving ANG aircraft require TAG concurrence. All OCONUS MRA
   missions additionally require theater coordination, approval, and will adhere to ANGI 16-169.
   2.1.6. Missions with inflated requirements are subject to cancellation. This is to preclude units from
   exaggerating load requirements to qualify for airlift.
   2.1.7. ANG Operations Functional Directorate (NGB/A3) provides a Staff Duty Officer (SDO) to
   assist all National Guard flying operation issues on a 24-hour basis. Access to the SDO can be
10                                                                  ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007


     obtained through the ANG Command Center (NGB/A3XC) at DSN 858-6001 or comm. (301)
     981-6001 or 1-800-443-2985.

2.2. Dedicated Aircraft Support The Weeklong Dedicated (DED) and Weekend Dedicated (WED),
consists of ANG C-130 and KC-135 units who provide volunteer aircraft and aircrews to NGB/A3XE for
MRA scheduling.
     2.2.1. DED availability will be from Tuesday at 1000 hours local to Sunday at 1800 hours local
     (departure and arrival at home station). WED availability will be from Friday at 1000 hours local to
     Sunday 1800 hours local (departure and arrival at home station).
     2.2.2. NGB/A3XE is responsible for the management and tracking of all dedicated missions. For
     assistance during duty hours (0730-1630 Eastern Standard Time) contact NGB/A3XE at DSN
     278-7148/7158/7162/7163 or comm. (301) 836-7148/7158/7162/7163. After duty hours the SDO can
     be contacted through the ANG Command Center at DSN 858-6001, comm. (301) 981-6001, or
     1-800-443-2985.
     2.2.3. Unit schedulers will submit dedicated airlift checklist (Attachment 3) to NGB/A3XE not later
     than (NLT) two days prior to the start of all DED/WED missions.
     2.2.4. When DED/WED are not assigned specific missions prior to the start of their tour, aircraft
     commanders will contact the ANG Command Center prior to launch and twice daily NLT 0900L and
     NLT 1700L daily.
     2.2.5. Aircrew duty day begins with morning contact to ANG Command Center. Aircrew duty day
     ends with evening contact to ANG Command Center unless aircrew must preposition the aircraft for a
     mission the next day. NGB/A3X dedicated aircrew duty day and crew rest hours will be in accordance
     with (IAW) MAJCOM regulatory guidance.
     2.2.6. All dedicated aircrews will self alert. Aircrews not assigned a mission(s) should be available
     for launch within three hours of an airlift mission notification by the SDO or NGB/A3XC.
     2.2.7. Aircraft commanders will maintain contact with ANG Command Center and provide times,
     maintenance status and current contact numbers for all dedicated aircraft flight activity at each land-
     ing.

2.3. Reimbursement Policy. NGB/A3XE provides special training (ST) days and flat-rate travel dollars
to the airlift units to offset a portion of the travel costs. NGB/A3XE will review unit travel expenditures
on a quarterly basis and will adjust as appropriate.
     2.3.1. NGB/A3XE uses after-action reports generated through the ANG Integrated Database Project
     (IDP) web based After Action Reporting System located at https://xox.ang.af.mil to validate and ini-
     tiate aircrew reimbursement (ST days and dollars). Reimbursement cannot be processed without sub-
     mission of an after-action report by the airlift units. Routine after-action reports must be filed NLT
     five days after mission completion. After action reports for emergency or relief operation missions
     must be submitted ASAP upon mission completion.
     2.3.2. NGB/A3XE has delegated the responsibility of managing ST days to the unit level. The ST
     days given to the unit under the MRA program account may only be used to support the temporary
     duty (TDY) activity of the authorized crew complement on MRA missions. Crewmembers sent on
ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007                                                                           11


  MRA missions beyond the authorized crew complement are funded by the unit. These days may not
  be used at the unit for any other purpose without direct written approval of NGB/A3XE.
     2.3.2.1. If funds are available at the beginning of each fiscal year (FY), NGB/A3XE sends the ini-
     tial FY authorization of ST days for MRA to each airlift and tanker unit.
     2.3.2.2. Units must report specific number and pay status of days on each after action report for an
     NGB/A3XE funded MRA or Joint Airborne / Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT) mission.
     This function is required for the reimbursement of Military Personnel (MILPERS) or Operations
     and Maintenance (O&M) funding even if payment of man days is not requested on that mission.
     2.3.2.3. During the last quarter of each FY, the unit must apply their remaining allocation of ST
     days to planned MRA missions through the end of the FY, resulting in a zero balance of ST days.
         2.3.2.3.1. Units that require additional days through the end of the FY must notify NGB/
         A3XE NLT than 1 August of the current calendar year.
         2.3.2.3.2. Units are to return unused days to the program manager. At the end of the Fiscal
         Year the NGB Financial Manager will then pull workdays and funding.
         2.3.2.3.3. Before units volunteer for additional last quarter NGB/A3XE funded missions after
         1 August of the current FY, they must first receive reimbursement approval of the missions
         from NGB/A3XE.
  2.3.3. NGB/A3XE provides flat rate travel dollars (used for per diem) under the MRA program.
  NGB/A3XE has delegated the management of MRA travel spending to the unit level. Since there are
  great differences in location costs, it is incumbent upon each unit to select MRA missions that remain
  overnight (RON) at low cost locations or on-base whenever possible. Units that choose to volunteer
  for MRA missions that stay at high cost locations must commit unit funds to make up the shortfall in
  travel funding or seek additional reimbursement of per-diem costs over those funded by NGB/A3XE
  from the user.
     2.3.3.1. The MRA travel funds may be given to the units as a special validation during the FY.
     These funds are intended to reimburse the last MRA missions that will terminate after the budget
     closeout for the FY.
  2.3.4. Standard Crew Complements. NGB/A3XE reimburses units per a standard crew complement.
  Reimbursement is based on the standard crew multiplied by the duration of the mission in days.
     2.3.4.1. CONUS Standard Crew Complement. The following matrix identifies the daily NGB/
     A3X CONUS standard reimbursement policy per aircraft type, additional crewmembers/crew
     chiefs must have prior approval by NGB/A3XE:
         2.3.4.1.1. C-130E/H - 3 officers / 3 enlisted.
         2.3.4.1.2. C-130J - 2 officers / 1 enlisted. With Initial Operational Capability (IOC). Addi-
         tional loadmaster is authorized if mission requirements dictate. (Prior approval required from
         NGB/A3XE).
         2.3.4.1.3. C-130J - 3 officers / 4 enlisted. Without IOC.
         2.3.4.1.4. KC-135 - 2 officers / 4 enlisted.
         2.3.4.1.5. C-17 - 2 officers / 1 enlisted. Additional crewmember / crew chief authorized if mis-
         sion requirements dictate. (Prior approval required from NGB/A3XE).
12                                                                 ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007


           2.3.4.1.6. C-5 - 2 officers / 7 enlisted.
        2.3.4.2. OCONUS Standard Crew Complement. For MRA purposes, OCONUS is defined as any-
        where beyond the outermost US Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) or any location outside
        the continental US. The following matrix identifies the daily NGB/A3X OCONUS standard reim-
        bursement policy per aircraft type:
           2.3.4.2.1. C-130E/H - 3 officers / 4 enlisted.
           2.3.4.2.2. C-130J - 2 officers / 2 enlisted. With IOC. Additional loadmaster is authorized if
           mission requirements dictate. (Prior approval required from NGB/A3XE.
           2.3.4.2.3. C-130J - 3 officers / 5 enlisted. Without IOC.
           2.3.4.2.4. KC-135 - 2 officers / 5 enlisted.
           2.3.4.2.5. C-17 - 2 officers / 2 enlisted. Additional crewmember / crew chief authorized if mis-
           sion requirements dictate. (Prior approval required from NGB/A3XE).
           2.3.4.2.6. C-5 - 2 officers / 8 enlisted.
        2.3.4.3. OCONUS Augmented Crew Complement. Occasionally, NGB/A3XEwill authorize aug-
        menting a crew to meet mission requirements. Units must coordinate with NGB/A3XE prior to
        mission launch if augmenting a mission is required. NGB/A3XE will authorize augmenting only
        on those missions where performance is enhanced due to the extended duty day or mission safety
        is a factor.
        2.3.4.4. Weeklong Dedicated Crew Complement. C-130 and KC-135 units who volunteer for the
        week-long DED mission will use the applicable OCONUS standard crew complement for reim-
        bursement.
        2.3.4.5. Weekend Dedicated Crew Complement. C-130 and KC-135 units who volunteer for the
        WED mission will use the applicable CONUS standard crew complement for reimbursement.
           2.3.4.5.1. Occasionally, NGB/A3XE has OCONUS missions that may be assigned to a WED
           volunteer. NGB/A3XE will coordinate with the unit to reimburse them at the applicable stan-
           dard OCONUS crew complement and ensure that the crew has availability to meet the mission
           requirements.
        2.3.4.6. Airlift workdays and travel funding is neither authorized nor available for any personnel
        beyond the standard crew complement. Units may add additional crewmembers to a mission for
        training purposes at unit expense.
     2.3.5. Reimbursement from NGB/A3XE will be accomplished only for ANG mission numbers begin-
     ning with DA, DB, DC, DD, DG, and DJ missions with some specific exceptions within the JA/ATT
     program. (See Attachment 2 for ANG Mission Number Matrix.).
        2.3.5.1. The funding authorization for NGB/A3XE funded JA/ATT missions (designated by the
        mission prefix DJ), is determined at the JA/ATT conference and is posted in the remarks section
        of the ANG mission number file. After the JA/ATT conference, units may obtain this information
        from the JA/ATT web program or through the mission query function on the NGB/A3X web page.
        Units will receive days/funding only up to the validation amount. For further JA/ATT guidance
        see Chapter 6.
ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007                                                                              13


         2.3.5.1.1. NGB/A3XE will negotiate with US Navy (NAVOCEANA) for support and funding
         for DJ07 missions that support NAVOCEANA.
     2.3.5.2. All other ANG mission number prefixes are funded by sources external to the NGB/A3X
     MRA account. Each FY, NGB/A3XE will issue a funding policy and procedures message to ANG
     units explaining reimbursement procedures.
  2.3.6. Mission Charges/Expenses. Airlift units that volunteer for MRA accept responsibility for all
  charges incurred in the course of executing the mission.
     2.3.6.1. Landing, De-icing, and Service Fees. Each airlift unit should plan to absorb all costs up to
     and including $500 per landing location. Airlift units may desire to recoup costs from the cus-
     tomer’s organization.
         2.3.6.1.1. Airlift units are responsible to notify customers of costs as far in advance as possi-
         ble before the mission so that the user has an opportunity to provide a fund-cite or coordinate
         mission adjustments to avoid the expense.
         2.3.6.1.2. The user and airlift unit will coordinate responsibility for payment of all fees appli-
         cable to airlift 15 days prior to scheduled trip date. If coordination has not taken place by the
         departure date, the airlift unit will absorb all associated fees.
         2.3.6.1.3. During the course of a mission, if the airlift unit chooses to land at an unplanned
         landing base for any reason (including weather diverts) and incurs fees, the airlift unit will
         absorb the costs as part of doing normal business. Excessive additional costs will be consid-
         ered for reimbursement on a case by case basis by NGB/A3XE.
     2.3.6.2. Enroute Maintenance Repairs. Each airlift unit is responsible for the repair of their air-
     craft if a breakdown occurs during an MRA or NGB funded “DJ” JA/ATT mission. Units should
     provide a unit fund site for use by their crews to procure parts within the AMC mobility system.
     Persuant to an ANG-AMC agreement, ANG aircraft on any mission may seek support from AMC/
     XOCO by calling DSN 779-0363 or Commercial 618-229-0363.
         2.3.6.2.1. When an aircraft breaks down during a MRA or “DJ” JA/ATT mission, the crew
         must first call the NGB/A3XC to advise them of the problem and then initiate the maintenance
         process with the unit or AMC/XOCO. During the course of the repair, the crew is expected to
         periodically call in and update the NGB/A3XC on the status of the disabled aircraft. The crew
         is responsible to begin trouble-shooting actions and to coordinate with the NGB/A3X SDO for
         possible alternate transportation (if required) for their passengers and cargo. The crew must
         also call NGB/A3XC and advise them of aircraft diverts, station over fly, mission delay or a
         mission re-cut.
         2.3.6.2.2. If it is determined that the best option for repair and/or continuing the mission is for
         the unit to launch a "rescue" aircraft then the unit planners must contact the SDO so that they
         can validate the addition of another chalk onto the ANG mission number.
         2.3.6.2.3. NGB/A3XE will provide the days and dollars for the rescue aircraft if the original
         mission began with a fundable ANG mission number prefix listed in Paragraph 2.3.5. NGB/
         A3XE funding will be based on the standard crew compliment listed in Paragraph 2.3.4.
14                                                                  ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007


            2.3.6.2.4. When the launch of a rescue aircraft is required for a mission not funded by NGB/
            A3XE, the unit is responsible for the funding. The workdays must come from the units
            resources.
            2.3.6.2.5. The unit is responsible for the funding and workdays for the maintenance personnel
            of all missions sent to evaluate/repair the disabled aircraft.

2.4. MRA Allocation. Validated requests for MRA greatly exceed the airlift training requirements of the
ANG. This results in the need for allocation that maximizes training.
     2.4.1. To maximize training allocations, ANG Deployments Team - Planning Branch (NGB/A3XO)
     has developed standard packages for the common off-station training events. NGB/A3XE will
     actively seek ANG airlift volunteers up to the standard package size. Please review Standard Packages
     Summary on the ANG website located at https://xox.ang.af.mil.
        2.4.1.1. Users seeking airlift beyond the standard package size are asking flying units to support
        them on unfunded local training missions.

2.5. Minimum Qualifications for MRA. Movements must have 5 tons of cargo or 30 passengers and
move a minimum distance of 300 miles. All users will meet this 5/30/300 rule, unless specifically exempt
by NGB/A3XE.
     2.5.1. MRA requires 30 passengers minimum at the initial on-load location.
     2.5.2. A secondary on-load location may be included on a MRA request if it has a minimum of 15
     passengers and is in a direct line to the destination.
     2.5.3. Waiver requests of the 5/30/300 rules should be sent in letter format to the appropriate valida-
     tor. The request must contain point of contact (POC) information, mission details, and a compelling
     argument as to why the waiver should be granted. The validator will ensure the waiver request con-
     tains all the information required to make a decision before forwarding it to NGB/A3XE ,
     ang.xoxe.mra@ang.af.mil.
        2.5.3.1. Users should allow 60 days for a reply to waiver requests.
        2.5.3.2. Waiver packages (approved and denied) will be kept on file for five years.

2.6. MRA Priority System. The National Guard has developed a system of nine categories of missions,
which are called priorities. Currently, the MRA program uses seven priority levels (Priorities 1 – 6, 9).
Priorities 7 - 8 are either reserved for future use or are not part of the MRA system. The purpose of each
priority is to describe the purpose of the mission and the funding source.
     2.6.1. Priority 1: Airlift for contingencies/emergencies/natural disasters. Response to contingencies
     and emergencies that warrant immediate response yet are not subject to federalizing the ANG. Exam-
     ples: Disaster relief missions directed by the Chief, NGB or the Director, Air National Guard.
     2.6.2. Priority 2: High priority/visibility airlift missions determined by ANG/A3. Airlift for NBG
     commitments/requirements (ANG/ARNG). NGB committed airlift support as programmed within the
     NGB budget. Examples: ORI and/or JCS Exercises.
ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007                                                                                 15


   2.6.3. Priority 3: Airlift requests critical for the units to maintain combat readiness status for units
   preparing for real world operational deployments. Examples: ANG Flag Exercises, ARNG Combat
   Training Center Rotations.
   2.6.4. Priority 4: Airlift requests that are important to maintain unit combat readiness status but mis-
   sion requirements do not dictate the use of military aircraft. However, it is important enough to the
   National Guard and unit training that the validator will fund alternate means (commercial carrier) if
   MRA is unavailable, ANG Annual Field Training events will be reviewed by the validator and the
   mission be assigned either to priority 4 or 5 as appropriate based upon the validators judgment and
   recommendation. Examples: ANG Annual Field Training and ARNG Annual Training.
   2.6.5. Priority 5: Airlift requests that fulfill unit combat readiness training or annual field training
   requirements. This mission would provide combat readiness training to the user but the ANG or
   ARNG functional area does not have budgeted funding for alternate airlift. Unit level user must fund
   alternate transportation or cancel the deployment if MRA is unavailable. Typical Examples: ANG
   Unit Training Assembles (UTA) and Operational Readiness Exercises (ORE); ARNG Inactive Duty
   Training (IDT).
   2.6.6. Priority 6: Opportune Airlift. This is travel to meet mission readiness airlift requirements but
   does not meet 5/30/300 (tons/pax/distance) rule (resulting in poor utilization of ANG airlift assets).
   NGB/A3X will not authorize generation of an ANG aircraft to accomplish a priority 6 airlift request.
   Airlift support may be possible if an ANG aircraft can support the request in conjunction with other
   validated mission(s), i.e., aircraft operating in the airlift system thereby not requiring the generation of
   an additional aircraft or adding an additional day to the existing mission. This priority category will
   automatically be assigned to any requests, which do not meet the submission guidelines contained in
   this instruction.
   2.6.7. Priority 7: Reserved for future use.
   2.6.8. Priority 8: Reserved for future use.
   2.6.9. Priority 9: Non-Mission Readiness Airlift Missions. Any mission that requires an ANG mis-
   sion number but is not validated MRA. Priority 9 missions are not funded under the MRA account.
   Examples: ANG/ARNG: MAJCOM funded air refueling and JA/ATT missions for non National
   Guard users.

2.7. NGB Validator’s Prioritization Matrix. Prioritization of ANG airlift is based on training for com-
bat readiness. To evaluate where an airlift request falls in the priority system, the matrix below is designed
for validator use:
   2.7.1. Are the users ANG or ARNG personnel only?
       YES (Go to next question)                              NO (Doesn't qualify/exit matrix)
   2.7.2. Is this airlift requested by the Chief, NGB or the Director, ANG to support a no-notice emer-
   gency / natural disaster?
       YES (Priority 1, Paragraph 2.6.1.)                     NO (Go to next question)
   2.7.3. Is this airlift required to meet mission requirements for a contingency rotation, Air Expedition-
   ary Force (AEF) rotation or a JCS exercise?
       YES (Must use JOPES, exit matrix)                      NO (Go to next question)
16                                                                     ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007


     2.7.4. Is this airlift request supporting a NGB commitment (line item in NGB budget)?
        YES (Priority 2, Paragraph 2.6.2.)                      NO (Go to next question)
     2.7.5. Does this airlift request meet combat readiness training requirements and meet the 5/30/300
     rule? (See Paragraph 2.5.)
        YES (Go to next question)                               NO (Not MRA/exit matrix)
     2.7.6. Does this airlift request meet combat readiness training requirements and was it received late?
     (WITHIN 45 days of the mission)
        YES (Priority 6, Paragraph 2.6.6.)                      NO (Go to next question)
     2.7.7. Is the airlift request important for combat readiness training AND can only be filled by military
     airlift (NGB must have budgeted transportation dollars to purchase military airlift from
     USTRANSCOM if there are no volunteers)?
        YES (Priority 3, Paragraph 2.6.3.)                      NO (Go to next question)
     2.7.8. Is this airlift request important to combat readiness training AND is it important enough to
     training that the NGB functional area has transportation funds budgeted?
        YES (Priority 4, Paragraph 2.6.4.)                      NO (Go to next question)
     2.7.9. Does this airlift request meet MRA requirements but does not meet Paragraphs 2.6.1. – 2.6.4.?
        Yes (Priority 5, Paragraph 2.6.5.)                      NO (Go to next question)
     2.7.10. Is this airlift for a conference, meeting, convention, or MWR event?
        Yes (See Paragraph 2.7.10.1.)                           NO (Go to next question)
        2.7.10.1. Requests for airlift to attend conferences, conventions, or meetings are processed
        through JOSAC. (See Paragraph 1.3.1.1.).
     2.7.11. Does this mission require an ANG mission number but is not validated MRA?
        YES (Priority 9, Paragraph 2.6.9.)                      NO (Go to next question)
        2.7.11.1. Requests validated as priority 9, (Paragraph 2.6.9.) are not part of the MRA system and
        are not funded by MRA funds.
     2.7.12. Is the mission destination outside the CONUS, therefore requiring an ANG mission number,
     but does not meet MRA validation requirements? (Justification and funding source must be provided
     with the request.)
        YES (Priority 9, Paragraph 2.6.9.)                      NO (exit matrix)
     2.7.13. Does this airlift request support a state/unit civic leader tour?
        YES (See Paragraph 2.7.13.1.)                           NO (Exit matrix)
        2.7.13.1. State/Unit civic leader tours are validated as priority 9, Paragraph 2.6.9. (Non MRA).
        All civic leader tours require NGB-PA approval and pre-coordination with a flying unit so that
        they can attach the request to an already scheduled training mission allowing mission support in an
        opportune status. No MRA funds are expended for civic leader tours and the generation of aircraft
        to solely support this type of requirement is not authorized.
ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007                                                                             17


   2.7.14. Chief/Directors Prioritization. The Chief, NGB has the authority to change any priority con-
   sistent with applicable law, regulation and policy.
   2.7.15. Requests for airlift from the Chief/Directors, NGB, will be prioritized according to the priori-
   tization matrix, unless specific guidance is given. If a Chief/Director's mission results in a supported
   mission reverting to a non-support due to airlift asset reassignment, the Chief/Director will be noti-
   fied.

2.8. MRA Request Submission Deadline. NGB/A3X receives NGB 214, Mission Readiness Airlift
(MRA) Reques, from a validator not the user. The validator must process requests and send them to NGB/
A3XE by the date specified in Paragraph 2.9.1., for the next quarter or at a minimum, 45 days prior to the
scheduled mission date.
   2.8.1. The validator has an obligation to process NGB 214s in a timely manner. The validation pro-
   cess must include a plan that provides for timely request validation when the primary POC is out of
   the office.
   2.8.2. The user has an obligation to maintain communication with the validator to ensure that their
   request is processed and forwarded to NGB/A3XE or returned prior to the submission deadline. NGB/
   A3X does not accept any responsibility for airlift requests that have stalled somewhere in the valida-
   tion process.
   2.8.3. Any requests for airlift received by NGB/A3XE after the published submission deadline of 45
   days will automatically drop to a priority 6, (Paragraph 2.6.6.) opportune airlift.
   2.8.4. NGB/A3X will not accept any MRA requests including opportune airlift within 30 days of the
   requested date.

2.9. Annual MRA Scheduling Cycle. NGB/A3X sponsors four conferences annually to match aircrew
training requirements with validated airlift requests. NGB/A3XE makes every effort to gather as many
validated requests as possible to present at the MRA conference.
   2.9.1. Annual MRA Scheduling Cycle:


Airlift.    Requests due.      Requests due.        Catalog.             Quarterly.

NOTE: The November Conference is held during the week between Presidential Elections and Veteran's
Day in applicable years. Dates are subject to change.

2.10. MRA Allocation Conference Process. NGB/A3XE will coordinate all activities at the quarterly
MRA Allocation Conferences.
18                                                                   ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007


     2.10.1. Validators should plan to submit validated airlift requests for the next quarter to NGB/A3XE
     NLT 45 days prior to the MRA Allocation Conference.
     2.10.2. NLT one week prior to the MRA Allocation Conference, NGB/A3XE personnel will consoli-
     date all validated MRA requests and produce a catalog. NGB/A3XE posts the MRA catalog on the
     internet at https://xox.ang.af.mil/. This airlift catalog becomes the basis of activity at the subsequent
     Quarterly MRA Allocation Conference.
     2.10.3. Authorized MRA Conference Attendees. Travel to the MRA Conference is funded by each
     attendee's organization.
        2.10.3.1. Mobility unit schedulers and current operations personnel are highly encouraged to
        attend.
        2.10.3.2. MRA validators may attend the conference to clarify and coordinate issues pertaining to
        their respective users. Attendance must be approved through NGB/A3XE.
        2.10.3.3. National Guard users shall not attend the conference without prior approval of NGB/
        A3XE.
        2.10.3.4. External customers are not permitted to attend the conference.
     2.10.4. During the conference, missions for the upcoming fiscal quarter are offered to the unit sched-
     ulers.
        2.10.4.1. Unit schedulers match MRA requests with unit training requirements and availability.
        Schedulers are highly encouraged to tie two missions into one trip when possible to maximize use
        of training flying hours.
            2.10.4.1.1. In order to increase efficiency, priority will be given to C-5/C-17 units able to
            combine multiple chalks into a single mission.
        2.10.4.2. Many AGs strongly encourage their in-state airlift units to provide MRA to their state
        forces. NGB/A3XE will make every effort to honor "States Rights" if a MRA request comes in
        with a pre-coordination note for in-state support. The name and phone number of the unit airlift
        scheduler must be annotated in the remarks section of the Mission Readiness Airlift Request,
        NGB 214.
            2.10.4.2.1. If not previously coordinated, the MRA Conference is the last opportunity to claim
            "States Rights".
            2.10.4.2.2. After the quarterly MRA Conference, all unfilled or open missions may be filled
            by any unit without "States Rights" being a consideration.

2.11. MRA Status Information. Updated MRA information is posted by NGB/A3XE on the Internet
NLT five working days after each quarterly scheduling conference. You can search the missions using the
query mode to determine the status of missions filled.
     2.11.1. NGB/A3X web-site (https://xox.ang.af.mil/) allows units to read the master database files
     generated by the Integrated Database Project (IDP). The site is only available to “.mil” addresses.
     2.11.2. The mission query option under the airlift page allows customers to customize a search to
     obtain information regarding mission status over any date range chosen. Selecting more than one
     option narrows the search.
ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007                                                                             19


       2.11.2.1. Open Missions - selecting the status "open" and unit "any" will bring up unfilled mis-
       sions that units may volunteer to fill.
       2.11.2.2. Filled Missions - selecting the status "filled" and a specific unit will bring up missions
       that the unit has volunteered for.
       2.11.2.3. Missions to a Particular Location - selecting either a specific International Civil Avia-
       tion Organization (ICAO) or the ICAO prefix (first letter) will bring up missions to that location.
   2.11.3. Unit Schedulers are expected to check the status of their missions on-line using the query
   functions as soon as NGB/A3XE posts the updated MRA information after the conference. It is
   important that all errors or disagreements be resolved immediately. This update will occur within five
   days after the conference ends.
   2.11.4. Users or customers can benefit by checking the status of their missions on-line.

2.12. Mission Cancellation and/or Changes. The user must notify the validator and the validator must
notify NGB/A3XE of any cancellation or change to the movement requirement.
   2.12.1. The MRA user and NGB validator must notify NGB/A3XE when an airlift requirement has
   been canceled. Since the MRA program matches aircrew wartime training requirements with NGB
   airlift requirements, users and validators are not authorized to cancel MRA in order to obtain another
   form of air transportation without coordination and approval from NGB/A3XE.
   2.12.2. All ANG flying units that volunteer to support the MRA program have an obligation to com-
   plete all MRA missions. A unit requirement to return an MRA mission less than 30 days from the
   scheduled mission date must be approved through NGB/A3XE.

2.13. Disposition of Unfilled Requests. Returned missions are open MRA missions that NGB/A3XE
has not been able to satisfy. Unfilled requests will be returned to the validator/user NLT 30 days prior to
the requested departure date. The validator/user will have the following options on returned unfilled
requests:
   2.13.1. Cancel the request thru NGB/A3XE and advise the requester.
   2.13.2. Obtain other transportation if budget / training dollars are available.
   2.13.3. Coordinate with the requester, NGB/A3XE and change the departure for further consider-
   ation.

                                                 Chapter 3

                MISSION READINESS AIRLIFT (MRA) REQUEST PROCEDURES

3.1. Long Range Planning. Off-station training requires that users plan well in advance to make the
most of limited workdays, funds, airlift, and availability of individual Guard members.
     3.1.1. Each state must develop a process to submit their proposed exercise and deployment program
     to their State AG for approval. The AG will submit OCONUS requests to the governor or his desig-
     nated representative (if the AG is not the designated representative) for consent. Requestors are
     responsible to insure that training events are properly validated and approved, and thus eligible for
     MRA transportation.
     3.1.2. There is a further requirement to coordinate the approved OCONUS deployments with each
     ANG Theater Advisor. ARNG OCONUS missions will be verified in Army Training Information
     Management System (ARTIMS).
     3.1.3. The remarks section of the NGB 214 should annotate TAG concurrence and ANG Theater
     Advisor coordination or ARNG ODT line number (if applicable).

3.2. General User Responsibilities. Users at the unit level work with validators who coordinate their
deployment program.
     3.2.1. ARNG users (unit level) will submit requests for airlift in accordance with the guidelines found
     in this instruction. ARNG users (unit level) will forward their request for MRA to the State Plans,
     Operations, and Training Officer (POTO). In turn, the State POTO will submit the request via the
     Electronic 214 process on the NGB/A3X web page to the ARNG Validator, NGB Transportation
     Manager (NGB-ARO-O) for validation and prioritization.
     3.2.2. ANG users (unit level) will submit their request for MRA using the Information Management
     Tool (IMT) NGB 214 to the unit level Combined Plans Function office that will ensure that the form
     is accurate and complete. In turn the Combined Plans office will submit the request to the ANG func-
     tional manager for validation and prioritization thru the Electronic 214 process on the NGB/A3X web
     page. The Electronic NGB 214 is located in the “Airlift” section on the NGB/A3X web site https://
     xox.ang.af.mil/.
     3.2.3. To increase the probability of support, all users should have a one-day window before and after
     the requested movement date. This allows the airlift unit to minimize nonproductive sorties, maximize
     flexibility, and affords the user a greater opportunity to obtain airlift support.
     3.2.4. Users may not request a specific on-load or off-load time. Users must be available to move any-
     time during the operating day requested. On-load and off-load times will be at the discretion of the
     MRA provider.
     3.2.5. Passengers are limited to two duffel bags per person unless specifically exempted by the MRA
     provider. Total weight of each duffel bag should not exceed 75 pounds.

3.3. Mission Readiness Airlift Process.
     3.3.1. MRA requests for airlift will be submitted through the appropriate validator to NGB/A3XE as
     far in advance of the airlift date as possible. This allows the validator time to process the MRA request
ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007                                                                            21


   and meet MRA scheduling cycle timing shown in Paragraph 2.9. Each validator is responsible for
   establishing a time line for their users to meet the deadline.
      3.3.1.1. Two MRA requests are required for each deployment (deploy/redeploy) unless noted in
      the remarks block as a one-way trip.
      3.3.1.2. Validators are required to ensure request eligibility for MRA support and must ensure that
      passenger and cargo descriptions are detailed enough to allow NGB/A3XE to conduct efficient
      aircraft scheduling.
   3.3.2. Validators (Functional Directors or their designated functional managers for ANG and
   NGB-ARO-O for ARNG) forward prioritized validated missions to NGB/A3XE for inclusion in the
   scheduling process.
   3.3.3. NGB/A3XE seeks airlift volunteers from ANG mobility units.
   3.3.4. NGB/A3XE updates the IDP database whenever there is any change to a mission.
      3.3.4.1. Units and customers may query the IDP database available on the Internet to determine
      the disposition of their mission (See Paragraph 2.11.).
      3.3.4.2. Missions that are still open 30 days prior to the departure are returned to the validator /
      user for disposition (See Paragraph 2.13.).

3.4. NGB 214 Instructions. MRA requirement will be submitted to NGB/A3X through the validator
using NGB 214. NGB/A3X has developed an Electronic NGB 214 that is located on the NGB/A3X web-
site. Use the on-line Electronic NGB 214.
   3.4.1. Validators are responsible to train their user community on how to complete a NGB 214. NGB/
   A3X will return incomplete forms to the validator for correction.
   3.4.2. The following is a block-by-block explanation of the NGB 214. Instruction for the electronic
   form NGB 214 is located on the website at https://xox.ang.af.mil.
      3.4.2.1. Section 1: Section 1 is to be completed by the validator only. The unit level user should
      leave this section blank.
          3.4.2.1.1. DATE RECEIVED (MM/DD/YYYY): Date validator receives form.
          3.4.2.1.2. PRIORITY: Indicate priority using the definitions found in Paragraph 2.6.
          3.4.2.1.3. APPROVED BY: Printed validator's name, phone number and signature.
          3.4.2.1.4. A3X MSN NR: The validator will insert the first four digits based on the matrix in
          Attachment 2.
      3.4.2.2. Section 2: Section 2 is to be completed by the unit level user.

                                                  Chapter 4

                                      MRA FLIGHT OPERATIONS

4.1. Command and Control. The State AGs may approve unit directed training flights within the
CONUS as authorized by the NGB. They will ensure that all flying units comply with all directives under
which flying operations are authorized. OPCON is vested in the AG.
     4.1.1. Commanders will maintain positive control of aircraft away from home station by requiring
     adherence to the approved mission-planned itinerary and all applicable governing guidance.
     4.1.2. MRA missions should be planned in a manner that will maximize the utilization of O & M fly-
     ing hours. These missions will demonstrate prudent accomplishment of unit training objectives.

4.2. ANG Mission Numbers. NGB/A3X assigns ANG mission numbers for all missions IAW the NGB/
A3X Mission Number Matrix (Attachment 2).
     4.2.1. Units deployed for an AEF or contingency are only required to obtain ANG mission numbers
     for deployment, swap-out, and re-deployment flights.
     4.2.2. Wing Commanders or Operation Group Commanders are the ultimate approval authority for all
     Unit Directed and unit funded Off Station Trainers (OST). Commanders approving off station trainers
     will forward a written summary of the planned flight itinerary, dates of execution and the purpose of
     the off station trainer to NGB/A3XE in order to obtain an NGB/A3X mission number. Requests that
     do not demonstrate a high training value will not be issued a mission number. .
     4.2.3. Off station trainers are defined as a unit O&M funded training mission that RONs away from
     home station or transits outside of the unit’s designated local training area. (The local training area is
     defined in the units AFI 11 Series, Volume 3, Chapter 10, Operations Procedures.

4.3. Unit Generated Mission Numbers. Units will generate their own mission numbers for all local
training missions.
     4.3.1. For training purposes, local training area is defined as:
        4.3.1.1. For CONUS units, the local training area is defined in the units AFI 11 Series, Volume 3,
        Chapter 10, Operations Procedures.
        4.3.1.2. For the units based in Alaska, the local area is within the state.
        4.3.1.3. For the units based in Hawaii, the local area is within the state.
        4.3.1.4. For the units based in Puerto Rico, the local area includes Puerto Rico and the Virgin
        Islands.
     4.3.2. To generate a unit mission number, use the following guidelines:
        4.3.2.1. The first character will always be a “D”.
        4.3.2.2. The second character will be a “U”.
        4.3.2.3. The third and fourth character will be a “16” for unit directed mission. No other number
        is allowed for unit generated missions.
ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007                                                                                   25


       4.3.2.4. The fifth character will be “Y” for primary Model Design Series (MDS) aircraft or “Z”
       for operational support airlift aircraft.
       4.3.2.5. The sixth, seventh and eighth characters will be the unit’s wing numeric designator (e.g.,
       136 for the 136AW, Fort Worth, TX).
       4.3.2.6. The ninth character will designate the unit’s sortie number for the day (e.g., if this is the
       first unit generated sortie for the day, use “1”, if this is the second unit generated sortie for the day,
       use “2”, etc.).
       4.3.2.7. The tenth, eleventh, and twelfth characters will be the Julian date for the flying date.
   4.3.3. ANG units are not authorized to use unit generated “DU16Y” local training mission numbers
   for off station trainers.

4.4. Mission Planning. ANG flying units will adhere to mission planning criteria as described in appli-
cable governing guidance.

4.5. Waiver Authority. Detailed waiver authority information for ANG missions can be obtained on the
ANG Operations and Training Division / Mobility Forces Operations Branch (NGB/A3OM) link located
at https://airguard.ang.af.mil/xo/ or by contacting NGB/A3OM. (Commercial 703-607-2935/2924/
2927, DSN 327-2935/2924/2927).

4.6. Maximum Crew Rest. Missions will be planned to maximize airlift and aircrew training. Crew rest
shall not exceed 36 hours at any location unless dictated by extraordinary mission requirements and
approved by NGB/A3XE.

4.7. Phoenix Raven Support. The purpose of Phoenix Raven support is to provide close-in security for
personnel and aircraft at enroute locations around the world. The team will always maintain a presence
with the aircraft. The Raven team leader will coordinate with the host nation/theater security representa-
tive for force protection support. The AMC Threat Working Group (TWG) who conducts operational risk
management assessments of airfields worldwide determines Phoenix Raven locations. The AMC TWG
regularly publishes an updated list of Phoenix Raven required locations. See website https://air-
guard.ang.af.mil/sf.
   4.7.1. ANG units executing an MRA mission will comply with AMC directives regarding force pro-
   tection to the maximum extent possible.
   4.7.2. A Phoenix Raven Team waiver request will include information such as threat mitigation
   actions and/or plans. AMC/DO is the waiver authority for AMC missions. NGB/A3 is the waiver
   authority for ANG missions. Waivers must be received NLT than five days prior to launch date.
   4.7.3. The ANG flying unit may incur a cost for using raven teams or for taking other mandated force
   protection measures on a mission. This cost will be passed on to the user. If the user declines reim-
   bursement of this cost, an alternate destination not requiring force mitigation must be selected or the
   mission will be declined. It is recommended that the user be made aware of the possibility of this bill
   when the ANG flying unit selects the mission.
   4.7.4. Since Phoenix Ravens receive a funding separate from the MRA mission, the airlift unit should
   not include Phoenix Raven personnel in the funds request on their after-action report.
26                                                                   ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007


     4.7.5. Detailed information on NGB/A7 Force Protection and Operations guidance can be obtained
     on the ANG Security Forces (NGB/A7S) link located at https://airguard.ang.af.mil/sf/.

4.8. Pre-Mission Itineraries. Each flying unit prepares a pre-mission itinerary for each assigned mis-
sion.
     4.8.1. All ANG mobility assets will input all mission itineraries (including local training missions)
     into the GDSS II.
     4.8.2. Units will input itineraries into GDSS-II NLT 14 days prior to mission launch. (AMC/TACC
     may perform this process for AMC missions.).
        4.8.2.1. Units will update their pre-mission itinerary as changes occur.
        4.8.2.2. Units will update their pre-mission itinerary using GDSS-II. Coordination with the ANG
        Command Center is necessary to avoid duplicate missions in the GDSS-II. All changes in itinerary
        after initial departure will go through the unit for updates in GDSS II or ANG Command Center.

4.9. Flight Following. ANG aircrews are responsible to maintain communication with the ANG Com-
mand Center for MRA missions or AMC/TACC for AMC missions from initial departure through final
landing at home station.
     4.9.1. Units will ensure flight information (takeoff/landing times) is entered into one of the automated
     mobility tracking systems GDSS-II for flight following purposes. If a system is not available to the
     crew, then they will contact the ANG Command Center or AMC/TACC who will take the informa-
     tion.
        4.9.1.1. It is important to report every takeoff/landing throughout the day because AMC/TACC
        implements an overdue aircraft checklist when arrival cannot be confirmed within 30 minutes of
        estimated time of arrival (ETA) at CONUS stations or one hour at OCONUS stations.
     4.9.2. Deviation Reporting. Deviation reporting includes changes to mission timing, destinations,
     diverts, delays, overlies, aircraft, aircraft commander, etc. Deviation reporting will be relayed to the
     ANG Command Center or AMC/TACC as soon as the deviation information is known. In some cases,
     unless directed by a higher headquarter, the deviation may require Unit Commander approval. Units
     are responsible to develop local procedures to up-channel a deviation.
        4.9.2.1. Units flying MRA missions will report all deviations that extend crew duty day or Sched-
        uled Return Time (SRT) to the SDO through the ANG Command Center as the event occurs. The
        SDO will validate the mission extension for funding purposes. The unit scheduling/current opera-
        tions branch should contact NGB/A3XE during duty hours to ensure that the mission extension
        was recorded in the IDP scheduling program GDSSII. This will facilitate mission funding from
        the after-action report.

4.10. After-Action Reporting. An after-action report will be submitted to NGB/A3XE NLT five busi-
ness days after mission completion (not including drill weekends). After-action reports are required for all
airlift, air refueling, JA/ATT, operational support airlift, and rescue missions. For Emergency/Disaster
Relief missions it is extremely important to accomplish after actions ASAP.
     4.10.1. After-action reports will be submitted to NGB/A3XE through the web based application. The
     web based application is the method of reporting.
ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007                                                                            27


   4.10.2. The ANG mission number assigned to the flying unit within the IDP system (including the
   chalk number) must be exact for the after-action report, otherwise it will not be accepted by the IDP
   system. Before submitting an after-action report, it is recommended that the flying unit cross check
   the ANG mission number(s) assigned to the unit in the IDP database. This may be accomplished
   through a unit mission query located on the Airlift Section on NGB/A3X web page. The specific
   Internet address is https://xox.ang.af.mil/.
   4.10.3. The mission number must match the FY in which it was assigned. All after-action reports
   must be submitted prior to the end of the FY. After the start of a new FY (1 October), units should not
   submit after-action reports for mission flown in the previous FY.
      4.10.3.1. It is extremely rare when an MRA mission flies over the FY changeover. However, in
      the event it occurs, mission planners must contact NGB/A3XE immediately so that arrangements
      may be made prior to the close of the current FY.

4.11. GDSS II Implementation. GDSS II is an AMC project that combined the functionality of GDSS,
C2IPS, AIRS, and other applications into a new system. GDSS II is the only AMC approved C2 system.
28                                                                 ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007

                ANG OPERATIONAL SUPPORT AIRLIFT (OSA) MANAGEMENT

5.1. Purpose. This section establishes the process for validation and scheduling of ANG OSA aircraft for
CONUS and OCONUS missions to ensure maximum utilization on scheduled flights.

5.2. CONUS OSA.
     5.2.1. CONUS Validation Responsibility. The service Validator is responsible for submitting DD
     Form 2768, Military Air Passenger/Cargo Request to JOSAC.
        5.2.1.1. Detailed information on obtaining a Requestor/Validator account, the DD Form 2768 and
        CONUS OSA passenger eligibility is available at: https://josac.transcom.mil/.
     5.2.2. CONUS Scheduling Responsibility. JOSAC is responsible for scheduling ANG OSA aircraft
     (C-21, C-38, and C-40) for CONUS travel when the unit makes tail available to JOSAC for schedul-
     ing. ANG OSA aircraft will follow scheduling priorities set forth in governing guidance. ANG OSA
     units will make aircraft available to JOSAC when other priority missions are not scheduled and main-
     tenance is not required.

5.3. OCONUS OSA.
     5.3.1. OCONUS Validation and Prioritization Responsibility. ANG retains scheduling authority for
     all OSA OCONUS missions supported by ANG OSA units.
        5.3.1.1. Congressional Delegation (CODEL) and White House Military Office (WHMO) flight
        requests are validated and prioritized through The Executive Secretary of the Department of
        Defense. Once authorized, HQ USAF Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, United States Air Force, Spe-
        cial Air Missions (CVAM) will present the selected missions for NGB/A3XE inquiry into avail-
        ability of ANG OSA aircraft. All inquiries of support will require completion of the ANG OSA
        flying unit mission support checklist to determine mission feasibility. See paragraph 5.7. for min-
        imum passenger criteria and waiver authority.
        5.3.1.2. National Guard flight requests are validated and prioritized through NGB-ZAS.
        Requestor will submit a completed DD Form 2768 to NGB-ZAS for Chief, NGB authorization
        signature (Block 13.f.). Requests not signed by Requestor (Block 12.h.) and Senior Traveling Pas-
        senger (Block 14.f.) will be returned without action. Upon authorization, the DD Form 2768 is
        routed to NGB/A3XE for coordination with the ANG OSA unit to determine mission support.
            5.3.1.2.1. Completed DD Form 2768 and documentation must be faxed or emailed to
            NGB-ZAS.
            5.3.1.2.2. NGB-ZAS will notify the National Guard requestor of authorization status within
            one to two business days after receipt of completed DD Form 2768.
        5.3.1.3. Active components will submit a completed DD Form 2768 through their appropriate
        authorizing official who in turn will submit the DD Form 2768 to their respective service validator
        in accordance with service directed procedures. Upon authorization, the DD Form 2768 is routed
        to NGB/A3XE and NGB-ZAS for staffing. NGB/A3XE will present the mission request to ANG
        OSA units to determine if the mission will be accepted by an ANG OSA unit. NGB-ZAS will
ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007                                                                             29


       review DD Form 2768 to determine if the form is in compliance with all applicable directives.
       Missions that are determined to not be in compliance with all applicable directives will not be pro-
       cessed for ANG OSA airlift support.
       5.3.1.4. DD Form 2768 can be obtained on the DoD link at: http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/.
       5.3.1.5. NGB-ZAS and NGB/A3XE contact information may be obtained at https://
       xox.ang.af.mil under OSA Airlift Procedures.
       5.3.1.6. National Guard requests should be submitted for validation and prioritization NLT 30
       days from scheduled departure date. Active components must provide NGB/A3XE and
       NGB-ZAS with a correctly completed, authorized and validated DD Form 2768 NLT 14 working
       days prior to the mission departure date. Depending on the nature of the mission, reimbursement/
       funding may be required prior to mission support.
   5.3.2. OCONUS Coordination Responsibility. NGB/A3XE inquires into availability of ANG OSA
   aircraft for OCONUS travel upon receipt of a validated and prioritized request. Requestors and vali-
   dators are not authorized to contact ANG OSA units in order to inquire into aircraft availability.
   5.3.3. OCONUS Mission Scheduling Responsibility. After OCONUS mission acceptance, the ANG
   OSA unit will coordinate all flight details with selected users.
       5.3.3.1. Scheduled OCONUS OSA missions of lower priority are subject to short notice mission
       cancellations if a higher priority mission request is submitted to NGB/A3XE. NGB/A3XE
       reserves the right to redirect or cancel missions in order to meet the mission requirements of the
       National Guard.

5.4. ANG Mission Number Validation Authority. An OCONUS ANG (DK) mission number will be
issued to the ANG OSA unit by NGB/A3XE only after a validated and prioritized request has been
deemed complete and acceptable by NGB-ZAS and the mission has been accepted by the ANG OSA unit.
NGB/A3XE may authorize the issuing of a temporary mission number in order to initialize mission flight
planning requirements.

5.5. OCONUS OSA User Responsibility.
   5.5.1. User cancellation of an OCONUS OSA mission must be coordinated through NGB/A3XE and
   the ANG OSA unit providing transportation.
   5.5.2. OSA users should plan/arrange alternate commercial transportation as a back-up. ANG OSA
   units are not required to provide spare aircraft or follow-on missions if the mission scheduled is not
   able to be completed. Additional support will be determined by the NGB/A3XE.
   5.5.3. OSA user/requester is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the DD Form 2768.
   Any discrepancies found on the DD Form 2768 will result in denial of the request.
   5.5.4. User must supply 24 hour contact numbers for all legs of the requested mission. Active compo-
   nent user/requestor must supply contact numbers for the service validator that determined the Priority/
   Urgency/Justification/Category (PUJC) code on the DD Form 2768, (enter information in Section 11
   of DD Form 2768). Failure to provide contact information will result in denial of the request.
   5.5.5. User/requester will ensure that authorizing official determines whether the requester is autho-
   rized to travel on OSA aircraft in accordance with DoDD 4500.43, Operational Support Airlift (OSA),
30                                                                  ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007


     DoDD 4500.56, and DoD 4515.13-R. Authorizing official and service validator will assume all
     responsibility for ensuring that travelers requesting ANG OSA transportation have met all applicable
     DoD, Major Command, and ANG directives, regulations and instructions. If it is determined by any
     ANG representative that all guidance has not been strictly adhered to by the user/requestor, the mis-
     sion request will be denied and subsequent missions will not be accepted until this situation has been
     evaluated and corrected.

5.6. Passenger Eligibility for OCONUS OSA. DoD requires all passengers to meet the air transporta-
tion eligibility requirements specified in DoD 4515.13-R. If potential passenger(s) do not meet the quali-
fications for travel on DoD aircraft listed in DoD 4515.13-R, then the requesting organization may seek to
gain an eligibility approval by requesting an exception to transportation policy.
     5.6.1. It is the requesting organization’s responsibility to work the exception through the transporta-
     tion policy process described in DoD 4515.13-R.
     5.6.2. IAW DoD 4515.13-R, commanders and other officials responding to requests for transporta-
     tion shall make no commitments concerning prospective travelers or cargo until the customer pro-
     vides the required approvals.

5.7. Minimum Passenger Requirements. NGB/A3XE is the approval authority for exceptions to the
minimum passenger criteria. Written requests by the user shall be submitted to NGB/A3XE NLT 14 days
prior to mission date. Waiver approval will be based upon mission requirements and efficient use of air-
craft capacity. Raven requirements will not be counted against minimum passenger criteria. Minimum
passenger requirements for OCONUS OSA transportation are as follows:
     5.7.1. C-21. Minimum three passengers at initial on-load and minimum of one at any enroute stop for
     on-load or off-load.
     5.7.2. C-38. Minimum three passengers at initial on-load and minimum of one at any enroute stop for
     on-load or off-load.
     5.7.3. C-40 Minimum 20 passengers at initial on-load and minimum of 10 at any enroute stop for
     on-load or off-load.

5.8. Submission Form Instructions (DD Form 2768) : Every block will be completed except as noted
below. All provided information must adhere to all applicable regulations, directives and instructions.
     5.8.1. Section 1 - Travel Statement: Requestor may provide a preliminary priority for the requested
     OSA mission.
        5.8.1.1. Priority 1 (Emergency) – Airlift in direct support of operational forces engaged in com-
        bat, contingency (Title 10), or peace keeping operations directed by National Command Authori-
        ties (NCA) or for emergency lifesaving purposes. Active component must supply appropriate fund
        cite to provide full reimbursement to the National Guard. ANG OSA units can not pay for mis-
        sions that support contingency missions i.e., Title 32 assets cannot be used to support Title 10
        operations. Fund cites will be supplied to NGB/FM for approval.
        5.8.1.2. Priority 2 (Required) – Required use airlift or airlift requirements with compelling
        operational considerations making commercial transportation unacceptable. Mission cannot be
        satisfied by any other mode of travel.
ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007                                                                           31


     5.8.1.3. Priority 3 (Cost Effective/Space Available) – Official business airlift that is validated
     to be more cost effective than commercial air travel when supported by military aircraft or official
     business permitting space available travel on a previously scheduled mission.
  5.8.2. Section 2 – Purpose of Travel:
     5.8.2.1. Block 2a. – Priority/Urgency/Justification/Category (PUJC) Codes – Leave Blank. The
     appropriate service validator shall assign the final PUJC Code. Active Component Service valida-
     tors must enter contact information in section 11. Failure to supply required contact information
     will result in denial of the mission request.
     5.8.2.2. Block 2b. – Complete Mission Description - Avoid the use of Service acronyms or
     abbreviations.
     5.8.2.3. Block 2c. – Priority 2 compelling considerations and reason commercial travel is
     unacceptable - All priority 2 requests (except for “required-use” passengers) shall answer the fol-
     lowing three questions:
         5.8.2.3.1. What is the compelling operational requirement?.
         5.8.2.3.2. Why is commercial transportation unacceptable within a 24-hour period?.
         5.8.2.3.3. What is the estimated commercial air cost of the request?.
  5.8.3. Section 3 – Total Number of Passengers: OSA missions serve multiple customers. Inaccu-
  rate passenger requirements adversely affect the efficient use of OSA assets and could create the per-
  ception of misuse or abuse.

     5.8.6.1. OSA aircraft have dissimilar operating limitations. OSA missions are scheduled IAW
     these limitations and may preclude landing or departing from a requested ICAO.
     5.8.6.2. ICAO codes can be found on the JOSAC website, https://josac.transcom.mil/, or in mil-
     itary/civil/FAA airfield directories.
     5.8.6.3. A two hour window must be given for both requested departure and arrival times. The
     larger the arrival/departure window, the greater the likelihood of OSA support.
  5.8.7. Section 7 – Cost of Commercial Travel: Cost on each leg should be computed from the near-
  est commercial airfield to the commercial airfield nearest the desired destination, and may include the
  additional costs of ground transportation, lodging, per diem, and other such appropriate factors may
  be considered .
  5.8.8. Section 8 – Cargo Transportation:
32                                                                 ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007

                                                Chapter 6

              JOINT AIRBORNE / AIR TRANSPORTABILITY TRAINING (JA/ATT)

6.1. Purpose. This chapter identifies the processes by which ANG units provide airlift support for JA/
ATT.

6.2. JA/ATT Program Description. The JA/ATT program is a DoD regulated, JCS directed, Air Force
managed and funded program designed to provide airborne and proficiency continuation training in a
joint environment. JA/ATT offers the Services an opportunity to jointly develop tactics, knowledge, and
procedures; increase proficiency in airdrop, assault landing, and mobility operations; and concurrently
satisfy user and airlift wing currency and proficiency requirements.
     6.2.1. NGB/A3XE manages ANG airlift support and other aspects of National Guard participation in
     the JA/ATT program. Specifically, NGB/A3XE:
        6.2.1.1. Validates all ANG airlift support for JA/ATT training missions (except local
        unit-directed training missions and missions tasked by Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) to
        mobilized wings). ANG flying units supporting AMC/TACC contracts are not required to provide
        JA/ATT support while performing contract requirements. ANG flying units are prohibited from
        outside agency tasking of O&M monies.
        6.2.1.2. Validates all ANG airlift support for JA/ATT requests/airdrop events in support of an air
        show or demonstration (except missions tasked by TACC to mobilized wings).
        6.2.1.3. Advocates for the ANG and ARNG JA/ATT user community. The National Guard has
        over 2000 jump spaces in units, and the majority of these are in special operations or related types
        of units (Army Special Forces; Long Range Surveillance Detachments; Para rescue Jumpers; and
        Special Tactics Squadrons) with a high probability of deployment or activation.
        6.2.1.4. Facilitates ANG wings and ANG/ARNG user units in satisfying their JA/ATT training
        requirements. ANG/ARNG JA/ATT planners can find additional information at the JA/ATT link
        on the NGB/A3X Deployments webpage (https://xox.ang.af.mil).
     6.2.2. ANG airlift wings are eligible to provide support to JA/ATT users from all services and com-
     ponents. The majority of ANG-supported JA/ATT missions occur in CONUS, with a smaller number
     occurring OCONUS.
        6.2.2.1. AMC administers the CONUS JA/ATT program, and manages support from
        CONUS-based AMC-gained airlift units. ANG/ARNG units in CONUS, to include Puerto Rico
        and Virgin Islands, should submit their JA/ATT requests to the AMC/TACC through the JA/ATT
        webpage at https://private.amc.mil/JAATT. AMC conducts bi-monthly JA/ATT scheduling
        conferences. Additional AMC JA/ATT guidance is found in AMC Operations Order 17-76, Joint
        Airborne/Air Transportability Training.
        6.2.2.2. PACAF administers the PACOM JA/ATT program, and manages support from
        PACOM-based PACAF-gained airlift units. ANG/ARNG units in PACOM should submit their
        JA/ATT requests to the PACAF Air Mobility Operations Control Center (AMOCC) through its
        JA/ATT webpage at https://www.ops.hickam.af.mil/amocc/tools/jaatt. Additional PACAF JA/
        ATT guidance is found in PACAF Instruction (PACAFI) 10-2101, Air Mobility Operations.
ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007                                                                            35


      6.2.2.3. ANG/ARNG users with JA/ATT missions planned in other Theaters, and ANG wings
      that have been solicited to support JA/ATT missions in other Theaters, should contact the NGB/
      A3XE JA/ATT validator directly.
   6.2.3. Transportation airlift (typically from a unit’s Home Station) normally is authorized in conjunc-
   tion with a JA/ATT mission. The JA/ATT program is not intended to be a source of point to point
   transportation. Requests with a negligible training component will not be validated.

6.3. JA/ATT Mission Validation and Scheduling.
   6.3.1. Validation. Wings are requested to notify NGB/A3XE of all JA/ATT missions they desire to
   support, either prior to the JA/ATT scheduling conference or as the opportunity presents itself; NGB/
   A3XE will not validate ANG support without prior wing confirmation of availability and capability to
   provide support.
      6.3.1.1. JA/ATT missions will not be validated without having a current DZ/LZ survey on file. It
      remains the requester’s responsibility to ensure the DZ/LZ survey is updated and posted on the
      Zone Availability Report (ZAR) prior to mission execution.
   6.3.2. Scheduling. After validation, NGB/A3XE schedules the JA/ATT mission and generates an
   ANG mission number. ‘DJ’ numbers are assigned to NGB-funded JA/ATT missions; ‘DQ’ numbers
   are assigned to MAJCOM-funded JA/ATT missions (AMC, PACAF).
   6.3.3. Crew complement. Standard crew complements will be utilized, as listed in Chapter 2 of this
   instruction. The following standard crew augmentation will be authorized, dependent on mission
   events and duration:
      6.3.3.1. One additional enlisted crew member is authorized when the JA/ATT mission entails
      cargo drops, to satisfy the loadmaster/Joint Airdrop Inspector (JAI) requirement.
      6.3.3.2. One additional enlisted member (a Crew Chief) is authorized if required when the JA/
      ATT mission must RON away from Home Station.
      6.3.3.3. Requests to further augment the crew complement must be justified, and will only be
      approved in instances where safety or mission performance are an issue. Additional personnel
      required to satisfy wing training requirements are to be funded by the wing.
   6.3.4. Prioritization. ANG missions supporting ANG/ARNG users, except for air shows and demon-
   strations, are assigned an ANG scheduling priority of 4. ANG missions supporting non-ANG/ARNG
   users, or any airshow or demonstration, are assigned an ANG scheduling priority of 9.

6.4. JA/ATT Mission Reimbursement. JA/ATT airlift missions can be externally funded (and assigned
ANG ‘DQ’ mission numbers) or NGB-funded (and assigned ANG ‘DJ’ mission numbers).
   6.4.1. NGB-funded missions. Airlift wing actions for an NGB-funded JA/ATT are the same as for a
   standard MRA mission: The wing should ensure orders reflect an ESP code of ‘AH’ and submit an
   After Action Report (AAR) IAW Attachment 6 to this instruction. Reimbursement for travel and Per
   Diem costs is at the flat rate of the ANG MRA program. Maintenance support procedures are the same
   as for any standard MRA mission.
      6.4.1.1. Pursuant to a negotiated agreement with the US Navy, the ANG provides periodic JA/
      ATT support to the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO). Airlift wings supporting
36                                                                 ANGI10-201 18 DECEMBER 2007


        NAVOCEANO JA/ATT missions process the mission as an ordinary MRA mission, except that
        travel and Per Diem costs are not claimed on the AAR. Instead, NAVOCEANO accomplishes
        direct reimbursement to the wing of full travel and Per Diem costs via a Military Interdepartmental
        Purchase Request (MIPR). Starting in FY08, all NAVOCEANO missions will be SAAM funded.
     6.4.2. AMC-funded missions. AMC directly reimburses wings for MPA days and indirectly reim-
     burses travel and Per Diem costs. Wings request MPA days via the Command Man-Day Allocation
     System (CMAS), and AMC issues an MPA authorization document. Wings fund travel and per diem
     costs, and claim reimbursement from NGB/FM under ESP code ‘2O’ (AMC in turn reimburses NGB)
     (Mobilized wings supporting AMC JA/ATT missions use the same travel and per diem reimburse-
     ment process). AMC is responsible for providing maintenance support.
     6.4.3. PACAF-funded missions. PACAF provides MPA funding only, and only for PACAF-gained
     assets supporting JA/ATTs in the Pacific Theater; it does not fund travel and per diem costs or main-
     tenance support. Wings request MPA days via CMAS, and PACAF issues an MPA authorization doc-
     ument. For JA/ATT missions supporting ANG/ARNG users, NGB/A3XE will assign an ANG ‘DJ’
     mission number and reimburse travel and per diem at the MRA flat rate. The wing will claim travel
     and per diem, but not ST days, when it submits its AAR. For non-ANG/ARNG users, the wing either
     must fund its participation from its own resources or request reimbursement of travel and per diem
     costs from the user.
