   CL-15.
   1.1.8. Ensures resigning members are informed that they must turn in all club membership
   cards issued to themselves and their family members. See Program Training Aid CL-15 for
   procedures. This program training aid is available in the club section of the Services Agency
   web page at http://www.afsv.af.mil.
   1.1.9. Doesn't allow eligible nonmembers to pay a one-time door charge for entrance to a
   club-sponsored program or entertainment.
   1.1.10. Maintains an official record of all club members which, at the minimum, includes:
   name, grade, home phone number, duty phone (if applicable), current home address, category
   (active duty, retired, etc.), account number, and monthly dues rate. Obtain this information
   from the Reports function of the Club Works software at http://www.club-works.com. See
   the Club Works User’s Guide on the Club Works web site for instructions. Protect this
   information in accordance with the Privacy Act.
   1.1.11. Reviews the Club Member dues report monthly and initiates actions necessary to

    1.1.12. Upon request provides a 180-day complimentary membership to any retiring Air
    Force active duty, Reserve, DoD civilian, and NAF regular employee. The retiree must
    obtain the complimentary membership within 90 calendar days after his or her retirement
    date. For details on processing these 180-day complimentary memberships, see Program
    Training Aid CL-15.
       1.1.12.1. The retiree must receive a club membership card with no dues payable for 180
       calendar days, and full benefits, including charging and check cashing privileges. The
       retiree may not be granted this complimentary club membership at more than one
       installation at the same time.
       1.1.12.2. The club manager notifies the retiree, when he or she signs up for the
       complimentary membership, that after 180 days, normal membership dues will be
       charged to their account.
       1.1.12.3. Begins charging the appropriate membership dues to the retiree’s account
       after expiration of the 180-day period, unless a resignation is received. If the retiree
       resigns on or before the end of the 180 days, do not charge dues.
    1.1.13. Proposes the dues rate structure for approval of the installation commander. For
    dues policy see AFI 34-272.
    1.1.14. Ensures charges and prices for all goods and services are standard to all, including
    official functions and community relations events.
1.2. Membership Cards. Having a valid membership card is a condition of membership. A
standard Air Force-wide club membership card is issued to members through the services of a
contract financial institution. Club membership cards issued by the contract financial institution
are the property of the contractor. Members receive the type of club card for which they qualify,
as determined by the contract financial institution. See AFI 34-272 for policy on membership
cards.
    1.2.1. Suspension of Membership Privileges. There are a number of reasons to withdraw
    membership privileges, i.e., financial irresponsibility, infractions of the rules governing good
    order and discipline, and pending judicial action (court-martial). In any of these cases,
    depending on the circumstances, the Services commander or the member’s squadron
    commander may suspend or withdraw membership privileges. This includes suspension or
    withdrawal of membership privileges from any member for cause. The result is either
    suspension of membership (temporary) or closure of the applicable account (withdrawal of
    membership privileges). For termination of membership on proprietary accounts, initiate
    action through the NAF AO to collect the entire balance due on the account.
    1.2.2. Temporary membership cards are authorized only for members who have completed
    a membership application and are waiting to receive their permanent membership card.
1.3. Guest Procedures. See AFI 34-272, Chapter 1, for policy on guests. Nonmembers and
their families who are eligible for membership in the club may not attend as guests except as
described in paragraph 1.5.4 The member assumes full responsibility for the guest's conduct and
any indebtedness to the club. The club manager uses the following procedures:
    1.3.1. An operating instruction (OI) must explain the privileges and conditions under which
    guests and employees can use a club.
AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002                                                                      7

   civilian equivalents may be held in the officers’ or enlisted club.

   a debt to the club is ineligible to be a guest.
1.4. Reciprocal Privileges. See AFI 34-272, Chapter 1.
1.5. Other Types of Authorized Patrons, Privileges, and Limitations. See AFI 34-272,

   organizations to use club facilities for noncommercial meetings and special functions. Either

   use the club other than to attend the organization’s function.

       these with the base Human Resource Officer). Use the Air Force standardized position
       descriptions (AF SPDs) or guides (SPGs) developed by HQ AFSVA/SVXH as a guide.
       Give each employee a personal copy during orientation and brief him or her on the
       contents. AF SPDs and SPGs are available for review at the servicing Human Resources
       Office.
       2.1.1.2. Coordinates with the labor relations section in the appropriate personnel office
       before changing and publishing any employee rules.
       2.1.1.3. Provides employees a set of "employee rules." Publish them as a handbook,
       brief employees, and have the employees acknowledge receipt with a signature.
       2.1.1.4. Creates an incentive award program supporting, but not limited to, the
       programs covered in AFI 34-301 and AFMAN 34-310.
       2.1.1.5. Documents the employee meal policy and procedures in an OI. In overseas
       areas make sure local national employees receive free meals as required by foreign
       government laws, host country agreements, or the SOFA. In other areas only provide
       free meals when it is determined to be in the best interest of the club. When a free
       employee meal program exists, the manager must determine which menu items or
       specially prepared dishes are available to employees at no cost. Where employees are
       offered a discounted price on meals, that price must not be less than cost. When
       employees are offered reduced prices, limit the selection to specific menu items. Ring up
       free employee meals through the Point of Sale (POS) system as ―Complimentary items,‖
       properly titled as ―Employee Meals.‖ Ring up discounted employee meal sales through
       the POS system as ―Promotional items,‖ properly titled as ―Employee Discount.‖
       Discounted employee meals are absorbed in the cost of goods sold. For accounting
       instructions see Program Training Aid NA-16, Recording Cost of Employee Meals, AFI
       34-209, Nonappropriated Fund Financial Management and Accounting (will convert to
       AFI 34-409), and AFMAN 34-214, Procedures for Nonappropriated Fund Financial
       Management and Accounting, (will convert to AFI 34-414).
2.2. Training. The flight chief responsible for clubs must:
    2.2.1. Include training costs in club operating budgets. Ensure club managers and
    employees are adequately trained to perform their assigned tasks.
AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002                                                                      9


   2.2.2. Enroll club managers and employees in Air Force or Department of Defense training
   programs.
2.3. Employee Skills Training. The club manager must accomplish scheduled on-premise
employee training at least quarterly. Document all training completed by each employee using
AF Form 971, Supervisor's Employee Brief. Use the standard Work Qualification Training Plan
(WQTP) for each position within the club. The Club Operations Guide contains useful
information on employee training. It is available in the club section of the Services Agency web
page at http://www.afsv.af.mil. Where available, obtain training assistance and advice from the
local Services squadron/division training manager. In addition, club managers are encouraged to
take advantage of appropriate and cost effective training available from civilian sources. For
detailed information on training see AFI 34-254, Services Education and Training.
   2.3.1. The Services commander or division chief may approve use of NAFs to pay tuition,
   registration fees, books, rental charges, and temporary duty (TDY) costs for employees to
   attend courses in management, food preparation, culinary arts, food service, and other club
   related subjects. An employee service agreement (normally one year) must be signed to
   ensure the club receives a return on this investment. See AFI 34-301 and AFMAN 34-310.
   2.3.2. For membership in professional organizations, see AFI 34-201, Use of
   Nonappropriated Funds (will convert to AFI 34-403).
2.4. Labor Cost Controls. Use the standard Air Force automated labor management system
for scheduling employees. Control of hours worked is the most critical variable in labor cost
control. The Golden Eagle Club Standards, (available on the Services Agency web site at
http://www.afsv.af.mil), provide guidelines on the maximum acceptable labor cost as a
percentage of sales. However, the ―right‖ amount of labor depends on the volume of business
(number of customers), skill level of the staff, the complexity of the menu, and the service
standards. Conduct an analysis of hourly sales and labor cost. See Club Program Training Aid
CL-2, Controlling Labor Costs, for details on the management reports available from the
standard automated labor management system. Use the management reports generated by the
standard POS system to review daily sales by revenue center and time of day. Compare this to
labor used each hour. See the Club Opening Plan, Part 1 and Part 3 for a detailed explanation on
how to determine staffing requirements and how to complete a basic labor forecast. See Part 4 of
the Club Opening Plan for how to conduct a break-even analysis. (The Club Opening Plan is
available on the Club page at the HQ AFSVA web site at http://www.afsva.af.mil.)

                                      FOOD OPERATIONS

3.1. Quality Service. Focus on satisfying members. Member feedback is essential, and an
active customer service measurement program is part of the Performance Based Awards (PBA)
criteria. Use the Golden Eagle Club Standards as the foundation for quality product and
performance standards. The club manager must establish realistic, measurable, written standards
for customer service, preparation, presentation, and the serving of food items. Clear, consistently
enforced standards, continuous employee training, and staff empowerment at customer contact
points are each essential to member satisfaction. Sound internal controls, quality purchasing and
storage practices, effective merchandising, and accurate market assessments are also critical
factors in a successful food operation.
3.2. Food Purchasing. The club manager follows these purchasing guidelines:
     3.2.1. Develop written specifications for meat, food, and supply items.                 These
     specifications must set definite, identifiable standards for each item. Specifications must fit
     menu needs, desired quality, market availability, and storage capabilities. Purchase food
     items only from approved sources (see AFI 48-116, Food Safety Program). Only the club
     manager can approve deviations to specifications. Review specifications at least annually.
     3.2.2. Establish par stocks with reorder points for such items as dry goods, canned goods,
     condiments, fresh and frozen meat items, and supply items. Purchases should be based on
     forecasted requirements. Local situations and contracts dictate the frequency and system of
     ordering. Consider cooperative buying with other Services activities. Use the NAF Prime
     Vendor (PV) as the primary source at bases and sites having a NAF PV contract. Buy for
     specific needs. The intended use of an item dictates the quality required.
        3.2.2.1. Buy the size that provides the best edible yield and suits both the menu and
        consumption rate.
        3.2.2.2. Buy in terms of "edible portion" costs. For information on how to determine
        edible portion costs see the Air Force Fast Food Management Guide. (It is available in
        the Food Operations section of Club Operations Guide, or on the Air Force Services
        Agency web page at http://www-r.afsv.af.mil.)
        3.2.2.3. Buy canned items in the container size most beneficial to production
        requirements.
        3.2.2.4. Buy fresh produce and vegetables by count, size, and weight when possible, not
        by case, box, crate, etc.
        3.2.2.5. Using prepared items (convenience foods) can reduce labor costs and food
        production time, but the offset is usually higher cost.
        3.2.2.6. Keep inventories as low as possible and within your pre-established inventory
        levels. Turn over food inventories a minimum of once per month.
3.3. Receiving Procedures. The club manager designates, in writing, personnel authorized to
receive purchases. Personnel performing ordering cannot be receivers because this violates the
most important principle of internal control, separation of duties. Every purchase must be
AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002                                                                        11


inspected for safety, quality, and quantity. Receiving personnel should know what was ordered
from the vendor so they can tell if the delivery contains any substitutions, overages or shortages.
Receiving personnel must count or weigh all items and compare the quantity of each item to the
amount listed on the invoice. All items must be counted or weighed in the presence of the
delivery person. Both the receiver and the delivery person must initial any corrections to the
delivery ticket. See AFMAN 34-212, Control Procedures for Protecting NAF Assets (will
convert to AFMAN 34-412), for additional details on internal controls.
   3.3.1. Receiving personnel must have a platform scale in good condition. The scale must
   be calibrated as necessary but at least once every year. Also make available, a two-wheel
   hand truck, a four-wheel heavy-duty receiving cart, a desk, a properly calibrated
   thermometer, and applicable clothing (for example, cold weather gear, rubber boots, etc.).
   3.3.2. The receipt of free items must be documented on the receiving report.
   3.3.3. If questions arise about quality or acceptability of a substitute item, receiving
   personnel should request assistance from management.
   3.3.4. Food safety concerns of primary importance at receipt include temperature, approved
   sources, and contamination of food. Cold foods should be received at no more than 41
   degrees Fahrenheit. Hot foods, if procured, should be received at no less than 140 degrees
   Fahrenheit. Approved sources must be in accordance with AFI 48-116, Food Safety
   Program. The delivery vehicle should be sanitary and food packaging should be adequate to
   prevent contamination of foods. Contact base Public Health for assistance with any food
   safety concerns.
3.4. Storage Control. Refrigerator and freezer temperatures must be controlled to prevent
spoilage, maintain quality, and prevent food poisoning. The club manager must:
   3.4.1. Keep storage loss to a minimum. Storage includes refrigeration (both freezer and
   chilled), dry storage, in-use storage, and leftover storage.
   3.4.2. Implement stock rotation – the oldest products should be used first. Place new
   products behind or below older products in the storage area.
   3.4.3. Provide properly calibrated thermometers for all refrigeration units. Assign a
   responsible person to record temperatures at the beginning and end of each workday.
   3.4.4. Make sure opening devices that can be operated from the inside are installed on
   walk-in unit doors.
   3.4.5. Have a sign posted on the outside of door of each walk-in unit stating, "Make sure no
   one is inside before closing or locking."
   3.4.6. Coordinate with the Services commander or division chief for the designated location
   of emergency cold storage.
   3.4.7. Display a prominent sign in the refrigeration area, reading, "The emergency number
   to be called for loss of refrigeration is   ." Ensure base Public Health is notified when
   refrigeration failures occur.
   3.4.8. Maintain freezers at 0 degree Fahrenheit or less.
   3.4.9. Keep chill refrigerators between 34 and 41 degrees Fahrenheit.
12                                                                 AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002


     3.4.10.   Lock all bulk storage areas, refrigerators, and freezers when not in use.
     3.4.11.   Limit and control the number of persons authorized access to storage areas.
     3.4.12. Before the start of each shift, make sure in-use freezers, refrigerators, and storage
     areas contain a sufficient quantity of food supplies for the anticipated volume of business.
     3.4.13. Maintain an issue record that allows only personnel designated in writing to draw
     supplies.
     3.4.14. Control keys effectively via a key control policy detailed in an OI.
     3.4.15. Change locks or combinations when personnel having access depart or when
     pilferage is suspected.
     3.4.16. Keep leftovers to a minimum using realistic food production orders and forecasts.
     However, all food operations have some leftovers and care must be exercised to provide
     proper handling as specified in AFI 48-116.
     3.4.17. For procedures concerning issues from the NAF Central Storeroom, see AFI 34-209
     (will convert to AFI 34-409). If the club uses a decentralized storeroom, a locally devised
     form may be used to record issues to activities.
3.5. Sanitation. The current version of the Air Force Food Code is the sanitation standard (see
AFI 48-116). General areas of importance include:
     3.5.1. Personnel. Ensure that a person knowledgeable in Air Force Food Code
     requirements is identified as a person in charge. A person in charge must be present for all
     hours of operation. Do not allow ill personnel to handle foods or work with food equipment
     and utensils. Monitor employees daily for signs of illness such as diarrhea, fever, vomiting,
     jaundice (yellowing of the skin, eyes, etc.), sore throat with fever, or draining skin lesions.
     Contact base Public Health for questions related to ill personnel. Personnel must wash their
     hands frequently and whenever their hands become contaminated. Coordinate sanitation
     training for new personnel with base Public Health.
     3.5.2. Food Handling. Use a properly calibrated thermometer to regularly monitor food
     storage, cooking, cooling, and reheating temperatures. Do not contact ready to eat foods with
     bare hands (use gloves, tissues, tongs, or other utensils instead). Store and handle foods
     properly to prevent contamination. Label potentially hazardous foods appropriately.
     3.5.3. Equipment and Utensils. Ensure food contact surfaces (to include equipment and
     utensils) are maintained, cleaned, and sanitized properly at the correct frequency and are
     replaced or repaired when severely dented or scratched.
     3.5.4. Physical Facilities and Poisonous Materials.          Ensure plumbing is properly
     maintained. A clean facility offers the best opportunity for prevention of pests. Coordinate
     other pest prevention and control measures with base Public Health and Entomology.
     Poisonous or toxic materials must be properly labeled and stored.
3.6. Food Inventory. The club manager ensures a complete physical inventory of all food
items is performed at least monthly. In addition, conduct a physical inventory of high cost food
items at least once per calendar week. See AFI 34-209 (will convert to AFI 34-409) and
AFMAN 34-214 (will convert to AFMAN 34-414).
AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002                                                                     13


3.7. Food Production Controls. The primary purposes of food production controls are to
produce the correct quantities of food based upon the forecasted customer count, control food
costs, and ensure consistency through standardized recipes.
   3.7.1. Clubs must use a food production control system with the following components:
   product specifications, standardized recipes, cyclic menus, and food production forecasts. At
   the minimum, menus must be reviewed semi-annually and revised as required. Proper
   control of food cost depends on accurate forecasting, purchasing food only as needed, proper
   preparation, and portion control. Use the Product Mix (PMIX) Report generated by the POS
   system as a source document to help prepare the food production forecast. The chef or
   kitchen manager uses the food production forecast, principles of cooking, and standardized
   recipes as tools to maintain proper food production control. Management communicates the
   forecast to production personnel using AF Form 967, Food Production Order, or a MAJCOM
   approved substitute system.
       3.7.1.1. AF Form 967 or approved substitute is maintained in the chef's or food
       production manager's office so the menu and future production reports can reflect
       changes to production and eliminate slow moving items. A copy of the AF Form 967 (or
       approved substitute) is made available at the kitchen workstations.
       3.7.1.2. Use the Air Force Clubs Core Menu standard recipes for at least 80 percent of
       the club’s menu items. A standardized recipe is a recipe that has been adapted to an
       operation, tested a number of times, and found consistently satisfactory. It is based on
       the portion size and yield requirements of the individual food service operation. Using
       standardized recipes ensures members receive a uniformly high quality product, costs are
       controlled, and production and planning are simplified.
       3.7.1.3. For the non-core portion of the menu, the club manager must make sure
       standardized recipes are written in a standard format, and that he/she tests and approves
       each recipe before it is put into use.
       3.7.1.4. Portion control is one of the most important factors of food cost. The club
       manager makes sure each food item served is assigned a standard portion size based upon
       exact weight, volume, size, or count. Ensure servers have the necessary utensils to serve
       the correct portion size. Include standard portion sizes on standardized recipes and AF
       Forms 967.
   3.7.2. Menu Cost Cards. The club manager ensures:
       3.7.2.1.   Menu cost cards are developed for all menu items served.
       3.7.2.2. Menu cost cards include: recipe title, selling price, ingredients, portion size,
       edible portion cost, recipe cost, food cost percentage, number of servings, contribution
       margin (profit), and supplies used as a normal component of the finished product, (i.e.
       boxes, circles, clam shell, etc.). The cost of these supplies must be added to the menu
       item’s selling price.
       3.7.2.3.   Cost cards are reviewed quarterly and revised as required.
       3.7.2.4. The format used is standardized. Computerized menu cost cards are the Air
       Force standard.
14                                                                 AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002


     3.7.3. Cyclic Menus. A cyclic menu offers a number of items on a revolving basis to
     ensure variety, popularity, and profitability. The use of cyclic menus is required for cafeteria
     operations. The club manager must approve all cyclic menus and changes.
     3.7.4. Sales Controls. Sales controls provide internal control measures in the food sales
     outlet through use of guest checks, scatter sheets, inventories, electronic cash registers
     (ECR), POS equipment, and other food cost control systems.
        3.7.4.1. Scatter sheets, AF Form 967 (or computerized substitute), and daily inventories
        (as deemed necessary by management), combined with effective guest check controls and
        managerial oversight, provide control of club food items. The daily inventory indicates
        what was used and the guest check, scatter sheet, or AF Form 967, when reconciled with
        cash register sales, indicates if payment was received for all items. Daily cash register
        receipts should equal the daily food sales value as computed from checks or scatter
        sheets. The club manager reviews all documents daily to control food costs. Use
        management reports generated by the POS system and management information system
        (MIS).
        3.7.4.2. Scatter sheets are a management tool used to determine the accuracy of menu
        consumption and must be used for each meal period. Additional information provided by
        a scatter sheet includes reconciliation of register tapes with menu items served,
        identification of slow moving menu items, sales mix information, and cost of goods.
        Computerized products are preferred. At a minimum, ECRs that produce management
        reports are mandatory.
        3.7.4.3. When guest checks are used, the club manager must make sure the central
        cashier controls and issues them on AF Form 1875, NAF Individual Cashier's Report, or
        equivalent computerized form. Reconcile used and unused guest checks on AF Form
        1875 or equivalent computerized form.
3.8. Nutrition. Wholesome and nutritious products and procedures are a necessity in all food
production. The club manager must support and merchandise Air Force nutrition programs. See
AFI 40-104, Nutrition Education.
3.9. Equipment Maintenance. Maintain an equipment log containing a description of each
piece of equipment, date acquired, maintenance and cleaning schedules, and agency responsible
for maintenance. The club manager must:
     3.9.1. Establish cleaning and preventive maintenance schedules for all equipment.
     3.9.2. Keep a work order log to track repairs.
     3.9.3. Forecast when equipment will wear out and budget for its replacement.
     3.9.4. Stay abreast of the latest developments and innovations in the food service
     equipment industry.
3.10. Cost of Sales Problems. There are eight essential steps in the food cost control process:
1) Setting a food cost objective (percentage), 2) establishing standard recipes for all menu items,
3) establishing standard portions for all items served, 4) setting the selling price based upon unit
cost, 5) controlling purchasing, receiving, production, and waste, 6) regularly monitoring food
cost, 7) enforcing internal control procedures, and 8) performing food sales mix analysis at least
AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002                                                                     15


twice per year. See Attachment 3 for some information on troubleshooting cost of sales
problems.
3.11. Air Force Signature Brands. Signature Brand operations must comply with Air Force
directives. In addition, each Air Force Signature Brand has its own unique operations guide.
See the applicable Signature Brand operations guide for standards, procedures, and requirements.
Signature Brand operations guides are available from HQ AFSVA/SVIC.
3.12. Name Brand Operations. See AFI 34-272 for policy. Name brand operations must
comply with Air Force directives, unless specific exceptions are listed in the contract, and
approved by HQ USAF/ILV and the applicable OPR at HQ USAF. For operating procedures,
see the applicable name brand operations guide. These may be obtained from HQ
AFSVA/SVIC.

                                   BEVERAGE OPERATIONS

4.1. Beverage Management. Knowledge of beverage service, procurement practices, storage,
control, dispensing, and merchandising techniques is essential. Focus on satisfying members.
Use the Golden Eagle Club Standards as the foundation for quality product and performance
standards. The club manager must establish realistic, measurable, written standards for customer
service, preparation, presentation, and the serving of beverage items. Clear, consistently
enforced standards, continuous employee training, and staff empowerment at customer contact
points are vital to member satisfaction. Sound internal controls, quality purchasing and storage
practices, effective merchandising, and accurate market assessments are also critical to a
successful beverage operation.
     4.1.1. Ensure each employee that sells or serves alcoholic beverages and everyone who
     supervises them receives initial Dram Shop training before starting work. Refresher Dram
     Shop training is required at least once per year. Document this training on the employee’s
     AF Form 971. See AFI 34-219, Alcoholic Beverage Program, for specific details on
     documenting this Dram Shop training.
4.2. Beverage Purchasing. The club manager must make sure:
     4.2.1. Alcoholic beverages are purchased in accordance with the procurement limitations
     outlined in AFI 34-219. Purchase by specific brands, from the best source considering price,
     item availability, minimum order requirements, and delivery.
     4.2.2. Bar operation costing and sales mix analysis is accomplished at least twice a year.
     4.2.3. Each bottle of spirits/liquor is marked to identify club stock.
     4.2.4. Establish and record inventory par stock levels for all bar items based on average
     consumption. Par is the number of bottles, by brand, to be stocked in each bar station or
     storage location. Par levels are based on the minimum number of bottles of any one brand
     needed for the period being stocked. Turn over the beverage inventory at least once per
     month.
     4.2.5. Vendors list discounted or free items on the invoice as a purchase discount. Reflect
     such discounts in the activity’s inventory.
4.3. Beverage Accountability. The club manager must use the following procedures to
control beverages:
     4.3.1. Secure all beverages and supplies when not in use and account for keys at all times.
     4.3.2. Conduct physical inventories of bars at least monthly.
     4.3.3. Keep a standard price list readily available for customers and employees.
     4.3.4. Make sure bartenders use standard recipes to make mixed drinks.
     4.3.5. Safeguard against persons bringing alcoholic or other beverages into the club for on-
     premise consumption.
     4.3.6. Establish a standard shot size (1 ounce).

                                   CATERING OPERATIONS

5.1. Catering Program Management. Use of the Air Force Catering standard brochure, Club
Information Catering To You, standard policies, and software is mandatory. Special functions
range from light snacks and simple cocktail parties to elaborate wedding receptions and unit
dinners with limited protocol, to dining-ins with very specific protocol requirements. The
individual booking a function must be a club member. See AFI 34-272 for catering and special
function policy. The club manager must:
     5.1.1. Provide a special function brochure, Club Information Catering To You, to assist
     members in arranging for their function. Ensure the contents of the brochure are explained to
     each function coordinator at the time they receive it. Use the Air Force Catering logo on all
     catering related correspondence.
     5.1.2. Establish standard catering menu selling prices (per person, per item, per dozen, per
     pound, etc.), facility use charges, service charge, labor, supplies, sundry services, contract
     items, rentals, and miscellaneous fees or charges. Use the menu layout from the AF standard
     catering brochure. The following items and services must be included in the established
     catering menu price: party planning and menu selection assistance, wait staff to serve guests,
     standard table and chair setups to include labor, china, glassware, silverware, and appropriate
     chaffers, sternos, and trays for menu items chosen; house linens, cocktail napkins, standing
     or table top podium, registration, cake or display table, United States and Air Force flags
     when available.
     5.1.3. Ensure charges and prices for all goods and services are standard to all, including
     official functions and community relations events. This does not preclude package deals,
     discounts, etc. Do not make special deals for official functions and community relations
     events that are not available to every member. See paragraph 5.7 for additional procedures
     pertaining to official functions supported with APFs.
     5.1.4.   Include special function income and expenses in appropriate activity budgets.
     5.1.5. Support sales and cost data with current menu cost cards and business projections.
     5.1.6. Use, update, and maintain the Air Force standard catering software and hardware.
     5.1.7. Ensure the club staff clearly explains to special function project officers the standard
     catering policies, and the project officer’s responsibilities (see AFI 34-272, Chapter 2).
     Provide the necessary pro-rata forms and instructions to project officers. See AFSVA
     Program Training Aid NA-8, Processing & Accounting for Special Functions.
     5.1.8. Answer special function project officers’ questions, and help them feel comfortable
     with the process.
     5.1.9. As a membership benefit, members do not pay any fee when borrowing (for personal
     use) small quantities of club daily-use china, glassware, flatware, or tables and chairs, when
     these items are not needed to support club functions. All borrowed items are signed-out on a
     hand receipt or log that indicates the current replacement cost of each item, and an explicit
     return date and time. Members must pay the current replacement cost for any lost, broken, or
AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002                                                                       19


   damaged items. If the member fails to return the items by the agreed date/time, the club may
   bill the member for the items. Ice, when available in excess of club needs, is provided to
   members free of charge. These member-lending benefits do not apply to squadrons and
   private organizations.
5.2. Special Function Contract. The club manager must ensure each special function is
documented using the AF standard catering software. As a benefit of membership, club
members are not required to pay room use fees for personal functions. The total contracted food
and beverage costs include a service charge that may not exceed 20 percent. The cost of
personal gifts will not be included in the charges for a facility, party, or function. Use the Air
Force standard catering software package Contract and Banquet Event Order (BEO) form.
Provide the customer a copy of the standard contract, and send a copy of the contract, or the
appropriate report, to the NAF AO. Distribute copies of the BEO as follows: one copy to the
bar, kitchen, special function catering staff, and other departments that may require the function
information. Following the event, compute all related charges using the catering software and
provide a final invoice to the customer for payment. Forward a copy of the invoice to the NAF
AO with AF Form 1875, or equivalent computerized form, on the first business day following
the event.
   5.2.1. The special function project officer or point of contact must provide a minimum
   guarantee two business days in advance of the function and agree to make payment for the
   number specified for functions when food is prepared. The club must not incur a loss due to
   the poor judgment or miscalculations of special function sponsors. However, common sense
   and experience in the food business requires occasional cost adjustments. Clubs must
   establish a local policy on guest count guarantees, and publish it in the catering brochure and
   on the standard contract. All clubs on a base must use the same standard policy. Guarantees
   must be between 95 and 100% of the number of guests specified no later than two business
   days prior to the function.
   5.2.2. Minimum guarantee deadlines must be set which allow time for buying and
   preparing special items. The catering staff contacts the special function project officer/host
   10 days in advance of the function to obtain a "ball-park" figure of expected attendees. Final
   menu arrangements should be made in person and the contract signed within 10 days of the
   scheduled date of the function. A final number of attendees must be provided by the project
   officer/host to the club catering staff at least two business days before the function.
   5.2.3. The person booking the party is responsible for paying the entire amount of the bill at
   the conclusion of the event. However, the club will accept payment up to two business days
   after the event, or for weekend events, on the first business day after the event. A pro-rata
   sheet listing attendees whose accounts are to be billed for their share of the special function
   charges is acceptable. Members must sign the pro-rata sheet to authorize the charge to their
   account. Project officers or hosts must obtain the member’s signature. The club manager
   helps project officers to understand that getting each member’s signature and obtaining all
   the information required on the pro-rata sheets is necessary to ensure payment. Project
   officers must protect the information on completed pro-rata sheets according to the Privacy
   Act. See AFI 34-272, Chapter 2 for project officer responsibilities.
20                                                                 AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002


     5.2.4. The project officer must turn-in the fully completed pro-rata sheets to club
     management before the function or not later than 1000 on the next workday after the
     function.
     5.2.5. Services personnel should reference procedures in HQ AFSVA Program Training Aid
     NA-8, Processing & Accounting for Special Functions, to follow up on dishonored checks
     and declined/denied/uncollected special function charges. After 21 calendar days, activities
     will write-off all remaining uncollected amounts for the special function to GLAC 774,
     Uncollected Special Functions. Follow procedures in AFMAN 34-212, Control Procedures
     for Protecting NAF Assets, for the write-off of special functions. Individual charges
     exceeding $1,000 must be approved through the NAF Council by the Installation
     Commander before being written-off.
     5.2.6. The function host/sponsor is responsible for paying for any damage to the club
     facility, equipment, decorations, or fixtures caused by guests.
5.3. Dining-In. This is a formal dinner function for members of a military unit. The
sponsoring unit is responsible for organizing and conducting the dining-in, but the club manager
must assist the project officer, particularly with the protocol aspects of the event. See the Club
Operations Guide for details on how to conduct a dining-in or dining-out.
5.4. Dining-Out. A dining-out is a formal dinner function for members of a military unit and
their spouses or guests. The guidance in paragraph 5.3 above applies.
5.5. Unauthorized Advertisement. Advertisements may be placed only in base newspapers
and in other military media such as the Stars and Stripes, Armed Forces Radio and Television,
and on-base closed circuit TV. Party/special function sponsors must be informed of this
restriction. Further guidance on advertising is contained in paragraph 7.2 of this manual.
5.6. USAF Recruiting Service Support. Air Force Recruiting Service personnel submit SF
44, Purchase Order-Invoice Voucher, to the club for meal and beverage purchases. The base
accounting and finance office reimburses the club when they receive the completed SF 44.
Attach the club special function form and/or POS receipt(s) to the SF 44. When payment is
received, credit "Outside Agency Receivable collected" on an AF Form 1876, NAF
Consolidated Cost Center Report.
5.7. Support for Official Appropriated Fund (APF) Functions. APFs are authorized for
payment of charges relating to the specific APF events hosted in a club (see AFI 65-106,
Appropriated Fund Support of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Programs and Nonappropriated
Fund Instrumentalities). Using this authorization places the cost of supporting official functions
on the Government where it legitimately belongs, and not on the club members. Commanders'
calls, flying safety meetings, award presentations, Professional Military Education (PME)
graduations, civic events, and change of command ceremonies are a few examples, (not an all
inclusive list), of these official functions.
     5.7.1. When room charges apply to an APF function, the club manager ensures that
     separate line items are included on the special function sheet (invoice) for set-up cost, linens,
     and utilities.
     5.7.2. According to AFI 65-106, organizations must use APF contracts to obtain services
     from Category C activities for official functions. The use of a Blanket Purchase Agreement
AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002                                                                       21


  (BPA) as the medium for executing this program is recommended. See AFI 65-106 for
  details.
  5.7.3. The use of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the installation
  commander and the services commander for use of APFs for official functions is
  recommended. The MOU provides a document that clearly defines the responsibilities and
  establishes the relationships between the installation commander and services commander
  concerning the use of APFs for official functions at Category C Morale, Welfare, and
  Recreation (MWR) facilities. For the purpose of this MOU, the installation commander is
  referred to as the supplier and the services commander is referred to as the receiver. (The
  installation protocol officer acts on behalf of the installation commander as the supplier.)
  The MOU is designed to protect both parties and maximize support to unit commanders for
  official functions. When establishing the MOU use the following procedures:
     5.7.3.1. The supplier establishes a not to exceed dollar amount for official functions
     conducted during the fiscal year and specifies this in the MOU. The receiver establishes
     a club account for official functions.
     5.7.3.2. The supplier establishes a decentralized BPA through the installation
     contracting office and designates who is authorized to place calls against it.
     5.7.3.3. The supplier establishes a funding authorization at the installation accounting
     and finance office for payments, using AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization.
     5.7.3.4. The club manager coordinates with the supplier (Protocol) to obtain a BPA call
     authorization number before providing goods and services for an official function. Place
     this BPA call authorization number on the party contract as the method of payment. This
     protects the club by ensuring the charges are authorized and approved for payment.
     5.7.3.5. Each month the receiver submits an itemized bill to the supplier for all official
     functions held at Category C activities during the billing cycle.
     5.7.3.6. The supplier reviews the bill to ensure all the functions listed are approved
     official functions. Then the supplier certifies the bill for payment. After certification the
     supplier submits the bill to Accounting and Finance for payment.
     5.7.3.7. The MOU is reviewed annually by the supplier and receiver, or more
     frequently if deemed necessary by either party.

                                            Chapter 6

                                 OTHER CLUB ACTIVITIES

6.1. Bingo Controls. The services commander or division chief carefully evaluates whether to
expand the bingo program to other activities supported by the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation
Fund (MWRF). Bingo programs in other Services activities may result in increased costs or
dilution of income to the installation MWRF. See AFI 34-272 for club Bingo policy.
     6.1.1. Bingo controls focus on three functions: (1) cash, (2) bingo cards, and (3) prizes.
     The club manager is responsible for the following bingo program procedures:
        6.1.1.1. Control cash (during and after sales) according to AFI 34-202, Protecting
        Nonappropriated Fund Assets (will convert to AFI 34-410).
        6.1.1.2. Unless waived by the MAJCOM Director of Services (SV), a POS cash register
        must be used to sell bingo cards (this does not preclude floorwalkers from selling cards at
        the tables). However, floorwalkers must sign for all cards received for sale and all sales
        must be entered into the POS system as soon as practical.
     6.1.2. Cash received is controlled by prenumbered tickets, issued by serial number to the
     patron, or by bingo card serial numbers. The bingo cashier is accountable for any missing
     numbers when turning in the receipts and AF Form 2046, NAFI Bingo Activity Report.
     Bingo cashier accountability is based on the number and value of bingo cards sold. Control
     paper, single-use bingo cards as controlled forms.
     6.1.3. Individual cash prizes less than $1,200, may be paid from the special activity
     (imprest) prize fund. When approved by the resource management flight chief (RMFC),
     payment may be made from cash receipts. Control cash during and after sales. See AFMAN
     34-212.
        6.1.3.1. Complete Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form W-2G, Certain Gambling
        Winnings, for winners of $1,200 or more. The W-2G need not be completed when a
        foreign national wins $1,200 or more in bingo conducted in a foreign area, and the
        foreign national involved completes IRS Form W-8, Certificate of Foreign Status. The
        completed IRS Form W-8 is retained at the installation involved.
     6.1.4. Use the following forms and procedures for the bingo merchandise prizes:
        6.1.4.1. Record bingo merchandise prizes bought and received on AF Form 2045,
        Bingo Perpetual Inventory. When the prize is awarded, the cashier must complete the
        "Issue" column of the AF Form 2045. AF Form 2045 has the date each merchandise item
        was received (column A) which is recorded immediately after receipt of the item in the
        activity. For security reasons, the AF Form 2045 is maintained by someone other than
        the person who has access to the bingo prizes.
        6.1.4.2. The bingo cashier or clerk prepares a prenumbered AF Form 2046 for each
        session. The "Cost" column of the AF Form 2046 shows the cost of the prizes awarded
        to the winners. Ensure winners sign the AF Form 2046 before receiving prizes. The
        "Cost" column is totaled after the bingo session. Attach the completed AF Form 2046 to
        AF Form 1875 or equivalent computerized form.
AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002                                                                        23


   6.1.5. ―Quick-Shot‖ Bingo Controls. Have a witness present to observe the drawing of the
   numbers. ―Quick-Shot‖ bingo cards must be pre-numbered. The head cashier or club
   manager controls and issues the ―Quick-Shot‖ bingo cards as accountable forms. They are
   issued by serial number to the employees who sell them. Record the serial numbers of the
   ―Quick-Shot‖ bingo cards issued on the AF Form 1875 or computerized equivalent form.
   Winning cards must be signed and dated by the winner and voided by the cashier making the
   cash payment to the winner. Winners of individual prizes less than $1,200 may be paid out
   of the cashier’s receipts with written approval from the RMFC, see AFMAN 34-212 (will
   convert to AFMAN 34-412). Follow the procedures in paragraph 6.1.3 above for winners of
   cash prizes of $1,200 or more. At the end of the shift, attach the winning cards to the AF
   Form 1875 as back-up for the payments to winners. Turn-in all unused ―Quick-Shot‖ bingo
   forms with the AF Form 1875 or computerized equivalent form. The cashier is accountable
   for any missing numbers. Control cash according to AFMAN 34-212 (will convert to
   AFMAN 34-412).
6.2. Monte Carlo (Las Vegas) Events. Monte Carlo events can be conducted in clubs to
support membership programs if conducted with the approval of the support group commander
in accordance with AFI 34-272 and DoD Directive 5500.7, Standards of Conduct, August 30,
1993 with Change 1, November 2, 1994; and DoD Regulation 5500.7, Joint Ethics Regulation,
August 1993 with Change 1, November 2, 1994. The club manager must enforce the following
procedures:
   6.2.1. Nonmonetary prizes must be awarded. Games or activities which result in
   participant "winnings" must be conducted with some form of money substitute. At the end of
   the games, prizes can be awarded to players with the most or least "winnings." Also, an
   auction can be held permitting players to bid their "winnings" on items purchased especially
   for the event.
   6.2.2. Once a participant purchases a money substitute, no reimbursement can be made for
   any unused portion. Money substitutes cannot be used to buy resale items, including food
   and beverages. Players may not exchange money substitutes for legal tender (currency or
   coin) at any time.
6.3. Entertainment. The club manager:
   6.3.1. Ensures entertainment is in good taste and does not offend the audience. Do not
   allow nude or topless entertainers or workers.
   6.3.2. Writes rules governing performers’ conduct as a part of their contract.
6.4. Activities Operated by Short-Term Concessionaires. Short-term (60 calendar days or
less) concessionaire services with commercial vendors for the sale of items, such as clocks,
jewelry, and art work, are authorized when such items are not offered for sale by the Army and
Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES). The club manager must coordinate any such commercial
vendor sales with AAFES. See AFI 34-262, Services Programs and Use Eligibility. Contracts
must be according to AFMAN 64-302, Nonappropriated Fund Contracting.
6.5. Barber and Beauty Shops. The Services commander or director must coordinate barber
and beauty shop concessionaire contracts with AAFES. If these concessionaire contracts are
club operated, they must either stipulate a fixed return to the club or provide for a percentage of
the income. Be sure to consider the cost of club paid utility expenses when establishing or
24                                                                AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002


renewing these concessionaire agreements. The club manager operating on a percentage basis
must make sure the cash register is read and cleared on the last day of the accounting period and
an AF Form 1875 is completed. When operating the shops as part of the club, an AF Form 1875
or equivalent computerized form must be completed for each day's business. See AFI 48-117,
Public Facility Sanitation, for beauty and barbershop sanitation standards. These sanitation
requirements must be included or referenced in concessionaire contracts.
6.6. Swimming Pools and Bathing Beaches. Charge a fee to fund club operating costs or
designate a portion of monthly dues for this purpose. The support group commander approves
the portion of the dues set aside for this purpose. If dues income is used, designate the applicable
portion as ―unearned income.‖ Then pick up an equal portion of this unearned income as an
―administrative fee‖ each month during the period of operation. Submit an AF Form 1875, or
equivalent computerized form, for all fees collected. See AFI 48-117 and AFOSH Standard 48-
14, Swimming Pools, Spas and Hot Tubs, and Bathing Areas, for sanitation requirements and
standards.
6.7. Point of Sale System. A standard Aloha POS system purchased for all Air Force clubs is
a part of a major standardization initiative. This investment will be effective for Services only if
the system is properly used, and kept current and standard across the Air Force. The Air Force
Nonappropriated Fund Purchasing Office has established a centrally managed, base funded
agreement to keep the POS system both current and standard. This centralized maintenance
agreement reduces cost and saves troop dollars across the entire Air Force club system.
Participation in this POS maintenance agreement by Air Force clubs is mandatory.
AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002                                                                       25

                                        PROMOTIONS

7.1. Promotional Activities. The installation commander can authorize promotional activities
involving vendor's or firm's merchandise or commercial products, up to and including $1,000.
This authority may be delegated to the services commander or division chief. See AFI 34-407,
Air Force Commercial Sponsorship Program. The following minimum guidelines apply:
   7.1.1. Promotional activities or events must be available to all club members. They are not
   normally scheduled in conflict with other club activities that regularly draw good patronage.
   7.1.2. The club manager and the commercial vendor or firm must sign a certificate of
   mutual agreement to authenticate the terms and conditions under which the event is to be
   held (Attachment 2). Make sure the installation commander (through the services
   commander or division chief) approves each proposed event. Accept and account for
   donated items according to AFI 34-201.
   7.1.3. MAJCOM/SV approves and sets other guidelines on promotional activities as
   necessary. See AFI 34-407.
   7.1.4. Promotional devices offering members free items based on chance can be accepted
   only when made available without charge. They can be issued or mailed with members' club
   statements to be redeemed for goods or services at the club. They cannot be redeemed for
   cash, used to pay dues, used as a tip or gratuity, or be used to purchase concessionaire
   merchandise or services. (See AFI 34-201.)
   7.1.5. Club card drawings are authorized. These are generally held one or more days each
   week and require a member to be present to win. If the jackpot is not won, a consolation
   prize, such as a free dinner, can be awarded to one of the members who is present for the
   drawing. The jackpot can be increased until someone wins it, or the club manager selects a
   point at which numbers are drawn until the prize is won.
   7.1.6. Members can be given a ticket or ticket stub with various purchases throughout the
   month or on special occasions. Cash register receipts can also be used. Each ticket or receipt
   must be signed and then deposited in a central collection point. Winners must sign a receipt
   for the prizes they receive. Members are not always required to be present to win, but must
   always show their club card to claim the prize.
7.2. Publicizing Activities and Programs. Club activities and programs can be published in
club calendars and monthly bulletins and in installation and civilian enterprise newspapers and
the like (that is, publications prepared for installation use by civilian firms). When
advertisements are placed in such civilian media for installation use, the statement "Open only to
authorized members and guests" must be included, unless the event is open to the general public.
7.3. Conducting Focus Groups. The services commander/division chief ensures that two
focus groups sessions are conducted semi-annually. Flight chiefs and club managers function as
offices of concurrent responsibility (OCRs) for these focus groups. Each year two focus group
sessions will consist of customers age 30 and above, and the other two will consist of customers
age 29 and below. Develop focus group questions to complement CORPORATE PRISM and
Customer Feedback Survey results. Explore desired improvements and customer satisfaction

ratings. The services commander/division chief provides the focus group results to the support
group commander within 30 days after the focus group sessions. Additionally, an analysis of
major issues/concerns, resulting program changes or initiatives taken to correct these concerns,
and any impediments are due to the MAJCOM/SV on 30 Apr of each year. For information on
planning and conducting these focus groups see the Administration section of the Club
Operations Guide.

                                    PROCUREMENT

8.1. NAF Product Source Listing. The club manager must use the Air Force NAF Purchasing
Agreements (NPAs) issued by the Air Force NAF Purchasing Office (AFNAFPO) as the primary
sources of supply for requirements. The NPA product source listing is on the AFNAFPO web
site at http://www.afnafpo.com.
   8.1.1. Use of the Essential Products Program (EPP) supports the standardization initiative
   and is mandatory.
   8.1.2. Use of the NAF Prime Vendor (PV), where available, is mandatory.
8.2. Commissary Purchases. Clubs may purchase items directly from Commissary stores and
the normal surcharge applies.
8.3. General Services Administration (GSA). Any amount of non-resale purchases may be
made from GSA. Resale items may not be purchased from GSA.

                           SANITATION AND HOUSEKEEPING

9.1. General Information. The club manager must make sure club facilities operate according
to sanitation codes and that employees meet personal hygiene standards.
9.2. Food Safety Procedures Training. Food handlers (food and beverage personnel) must be
trained according to AFI 48-116, Food Safety Program, to minimize the possibility of food or
beverage borne illnesses. The club manager must consult with the installation public health staff
to determine local food handler health requirements. All food handlers must receive initial
formal training on food and beverage safety procedures. Continuous on-the-job training should
also occur throughout employment. The supervisor of each employee who serves or handles food
or beverages documents this formal and on-the-job food safety procedures training in the
employee’s work folder. Use the comments section of the Supervisor’s Employee Brief for this
action.
9.3. Food Spoilage. Food operation employees must be extremely careful to ensure all food is
free from spoilage or contamination, and safe for human consumption. Food must always be
protected (during storage, preparation, display, serving, and transport) from potential
contamination. Spoilage items costing less than $100 are absorbed into the cost of goods.
Spoilage items costing $100 or more require certification by the Military Public Health Office.
See AFMAN 34-214 (will convert to AFMAN 34-414).
9.4. Pest Control. The base civil engineer is responsible for insect and rodent control and
must provide qualified personnel to correct infestations. The club manager must establish a
schedule of pest prevention measures.
9.5. General Housekeeping. Club property, inside and outside, must be kept clean and litter
free. The club manager must develop regular housekeeping and cleaning instructions. Post the
instructions with schedules so they are readily available to employees.
9.6. In-House Sanitation Inspections. The club manager must conduct self inspections at
least weekly. Use AF Form 977, Food Facility Evaluation, as a guide. Keep the checklist on file
in the club for 90 days. Develop a good sanitation program by conducting an annual employee
training program.

                                FACILITY MANAGEMENT

10.1. Improvement Projects. AFI 34-105, Programming for Nonappropriated Fund Facility
Requirements, (will convert to AFI 34-205) provides guidance and procedures for planning,
programming, and funding NAF capital improvement projects as well as developing and
executing a long-range capital improvement plan. Additional information on NAF facility issues
is available in the facilities area on the AF Services Agency web site at http://www-
r.afsv.af.mil.
10.2. Minor Maintenance and Repair. Regularly scheduled inspections reduce maintenance
costs. The club manager must:
   10.2.1. Establish a routine inspection system to reduce hazards and determine replacement
   or maintenance needs.
   10.2.2. Develop employee inspection and cleaning assignments for frequently used
   equipment. Document the inspection frequency and cleaning requirements in the club’s OI
   on facility and equipment maintenance.
   10.2.3. Decide how often other equipment, furniture, and fixtures should be inspected and
   cleaned, based on condition, age, and usage. Document this in the club’s OI on facility and
   equipment maintenance.
   10.2.4. Designate a club employee with management responsibility to receive discrepancy
   reports and have property repaired or replaced.
   10.2.5. Report inadequate facilities and safety hazards to the base civil engineer. Maintain
   a work order call log in the club office.
   10.2.6. Use the most cost effective source for maintenance and repair. In addition to cost,
   consider quality and reliability of products and services.
10.3. Fire Prevention. See AFI 32-2001, The Fire Protection Operations and Fire Prevention
Program. The club manager must:
   10.3.1. Ensure all decorations are fire resistant and meet the base fire standards. Obtain a
   copy of the standards from the base fire department and attach them to the club OI on fire
   prevention.
   10.3.2. When a function is booked, inform decorating committees of these fire prevention
   standards to avoid misunderstandings and wasted funds.
10.4. Building Safety. The club manager must coordinate with the base safety office to
establish a general safety program to include routine inspections and personnel training.
10.5. Energy Conservation. Club management trains employees to practice energy
conservation techniques. Taking advantage of an energy audit (offered free by most utility
companies), is an excellent means of identifying waste and ways to reduce utility consumption.
Monitor monthly utility expenses to make sure the charges are billed correctly. Ensure base civil
engineers inspect and clean the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) unit and clean

or replace air conditioning filters at least annually, and more frequently if conditions warrant.
Continuously look for ways to use energy more efficiently.

                  TROUBLE SHOOTING COST OF SALES PROBLEMS

Section A3A- Review the Paperwork and Physical Counts
A3.1. When you think you have a cost of sales problem the first thing to do is to check the
paperwork. Our accounting system uses the following formula to compute Cost of Sales:
Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory = Cost of Sales.
A3.2. Check the Beginning Inventory number. It should be identical to Ending Inventory
number from the previous period. If it is not exactly the same, contact your NAF AO.
A3.3. Check for missed transfers and also check the accuracy of each for cost, quantity, math
errors, etc.
A3.4. An accurate physical inventory is essential. Use your computerized inventory
management system to generate a variance report. It will tell you the actual use by item
compared to the ideal (―should have‖ used) based upon the sales data you input (use the POS
interface). If you don’t have this capability, you can compare sales with inventory count sheets.
Recount items with abnormal variances. Be sure to consider any sales and items received since
the original inventory was completed.
A3.5. Review the inventory count sheets and compare them with those from pervious months,
looking for unusual variances. Carefully check inventory extensions to ensure they are accurate.
Check the units and the unit cost. Check the math on the inventory extensions if these are not
done by computer.
A3.6. Next check to ensure the purchases are accurately recorded for the period. Review all
your daily purchases for the month and add them up. Do not forget to include items purchased
via petty cash, IMPAC Card, and purchase orders.
A3.7. Now compute your cost of sales using the formula above, and the numbers for Beginning
Inventory, Purchases, and Ending Inventory from your research. Do you have a cost of sales
problem now, or was it just a paperwork error? {Caution: To get an accurate figure you will
need to add in transportation cost and Commissary Surcharge – GLAC 4012.}

Section A3B—- Step 2: Variance Analysis
A3.8. You have already reviewed the paperwork and found that you have an actual food cost
problem, not just a paper problem. Now you need to find the source of this problem. The next
step is to figure out which items are causing the cost problem. Finding the cause will be simple,
If you are using the standard computerized inventory management software and inputting the
data each workday. The ―Management Summary,‖ ―Item Use Report,‖ and ―Item Use Group
Summary‖ reports are all available to each Air Force club from the basic modules of the
software.
   A3.8.1. ―Management Summary Report:‖ This is the ―flagship‖ report for managing your
   inventory. On one page it shows you virtually all the information you need to make food
   usage control decisions. It provides an overview of sales, actual and ideal cost of goods, and
   a list of the 15 highest overused items as well as the 5 highest underused items for the report
   period. Items are ranked by dollars of overused or underused, with the highest first. This
36                                                                AFMAN34-228 1 APRIL 2002


     report gives a quick single-page review of the operation and its major problems without
     burying you in extensive detail.
     A3.8.2. ―Item Use Report:‖ This provides basically the same information as the
     ―Management Summary Report‖ but it includes the details for ALL items in the inventory.
     The report is organized by item report group, and contains subtotals by group, as well as a
     grand total for all groups.
     A3.8.3. ―Item Use Group Summary:‖ This report shows the subtotals for each item group
     (from the ―Item Use Report‖) as well as the grand total for the period. No individual items
     are shown on this report.

Section A3C— Step 3: Find and Fix
A3.9. Using the above reports you have now identified the inventory items that are ―overused.‖
The term ―overused‖ means that actual use exceeded the ideal use. In other words, stuff is
―missing in action.‖ Possible causes of overuse include: larger portions that specified, poor yield
(purchasing or preparation problems), waste, spoilage, purveyor theft, or employee theft. To
solve this mystery carefully observe your operation and ask questions such as; ―Why did we use
128 steaks last week when we only sold 113?‖ Get your kitchen management staff involved in
helping find the solution. Use a shift Waste Sheet and a special ―Waste Bin.‖ If you want to
reduce waste, require the staff to put everything that is wasted (steak burned on grill, etc.) during
the shift into the special ―Waste Bin.‖ At the end of the shift have the person in charge of the
kitchen go through the ―Waste Bin‖ (wear rubber gloves) and write down on the Waste Sheet
everything that is in the bin. Management reviews these daily and discusses the findings with
the staff in order to reduce waste.
A3.10. The above list of tips is intended to provide some basic information on how to get
started on finding and fixing cost of sales problems. It is by no means all inclusive. Controlling
food cost is a continuous task for the club manager. If it is done well on a day-to-day basis it
pays big dividends in terms of bottom line results.

     IC 2002-1 TO AFMAN 34-228, AIR FORCE CLUB PROGRAM PROCEDURES

1 APRIL 2002

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

This revision incorporates Interim Change IC 2002-1. This interim change deletes the
requirement to use AF Form 1216, Food Handler Training Certificate, which is obsolete. It
requires the supervisor of each employee who serves or handles food and/or beverages to
document food handlers training in the employee’s work folder in the comments section of the
Supervisor’s Employee Brief. Interim Change (IC) 2002-01 entirely replaces paragraph 9.2. A
―|‖ indicates revisions from the previous edition.

9.2. Food Safety Procedures Training. Food handlers (food and beverage personnel) must be
trained according to AFI 48-116, Food Safety Program, to minimize the possibility of food or
beverage borne illnesses. The club manager must consult with the installation public health staff
to determine local food handler health requirements. All food handlers must receive initial
formal training on food and beverage safety procedures. Continuous on-the-job training should
also occur throughout employment. The supervisor of each employee who serves or handles food
or beverages documents this formal and on-the-job food safety procedures training in the
employee’s work folder. Use the comments section of the Supervisor’s Employee Brief for this
action.
