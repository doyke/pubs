1. Background. The President of the United States (POTUS) exercises appointment authority
for all Air Force officers.
     1.1. The commissioning of every Air Force officer is predicated on an approved original
     appointment for the specific grade in which the nominee is accessed. To ensure only
     qualified applicants are nominated for original appointment, the Air Force implements a set
     of procedures to effectively and efficiently identify and review nominees. Nominees are
     evaluated against statutory, Air Force, component, and appointment source specific
     eligibility criteria during the accession process. To ensure nominees selected for
     appointment are approved in a timely manner, each component consolidates nominees into
     formatted nomination packages and processes them through an approval chain that includes
     Headquarters Air Force (HAF), DepSecDef, SecDef, White House, and Senate.

       coordinates transmission across AF/JA, SAF/MR, and WHS, and disseminates

   Personnel Center (AFPC), National Guard Bureau (NGB), Manpower, Personnel & Services
   (NGB/A1), and Air Reserve Personnel Center (ARPC) for the RegAF, ANG, and AFR

   nomination requirements, policies, procedures, guides, and checklists for their component’s

   will be accessed into the Air Force.

     sources employ criteria consisting of Air Force-wide component and appointment specific
     requirements to determine qualified nominees and grade. See Table A2.1 Appointment
     Sources at Attachment 2.
3. Appointment Process.
     3.1. Appointment Sources.
        3.1.1. Identify officer candidates and collect source documentation on individual
        candidates to determine eligibility.
        3.1.2. Review authoritative personnel data to evaluate qualification for appointment and
        grade,     and verify the candidate’s background information against the source
        documentation.
        3.1.3. Complete prescribed appointment nomination documents for viable candidates
        who are deemed qualified for appointment. The appointment source completes a
        candidate checklist to document the verification of the candidate’s eligibility for
        appointment. Appointment sources will determine the grade using criteria from AFI 36-
        2005, Appointment in Commissioned Grades and Designation and Assignment in
        Professional Categories - Reserve of the Air Force and Unites States Air Force. Grade
        calculation errors are the responsibility of the appointment source and will reflect in the
        appointment sources error rate. See para 3.2.7 for additional information.
        3.1.4. Submit candidates for appointment to the appropriate component nomination
        source. Use proposed rank of the candidate to determine the number of days before the
        target appointment date that the candidate is submitted for component nomination source
        review and approval. Captain and below in the RegAF and lieutenant colonel and below
        for ResAF are submitted to the component nomination source 60 to 240 days prior to the
        targeted appointment date. Major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel in the RegAF and
        colonel in the ResAF must be submitted to the component nomination source 100 to 240
        days prior to the targeted appointment date.
        3.1.5. Pursue expedited appointment procedures when targeted appointment date is less
        than that prescribed in 3.1.4. Expedited nominations may be requested by appointment
        sources; however, appointment source must provide justification to the component
        nomination source. Written request for expedited processing must justify the expedited
        processing to include the impact if the nomination is not approved by the targeted
        appointment date, and preventative measures taken to prevent similar requests.
        3.1.6. RegAF will use proceed (travel) date as the effective appointment date. The
        Reserve will use the commissioning date as the effective appointment date.
     3.2. Component Nomination Sources.
        3.2.1. Receive list of nominees, signed nominee checklist, and expedited processing
        requests from appointment sources.
        3.2.2. Validate that only viable nominees are listed and notify the appropriate
        appointment source of any identified errors.
        3.2.3. Ensure nominee’s proposed grade is determined using criteria from AFI 36-2005
        prior to appointment.
AFI36-2030 13 NOVEMBER 2013                                                                5


     3.2.4. Utilize Judge Advocate office at the component nomination source when
     individual nominees require a legal review.
     3.2.5. Convert lists of nominees into nomination packages and submit packages. Use
     proposed rank of the candidate to determine the number of days before the target
     appointment date that the candidate is submitted review and approval: Captain and
     below in the RegAF and lieutenant colonel and below for ResAF are submitted to the
     component nomination source 40 to 240 days prior to the targeted appointment date.
     Major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel in the RegAF and colonel in the ResAF are
     submitted to the component nomination source 90 to 240 days prior to the targeted
     appointment date. If the targeted appointment date is less than stated above, the
     component nomination source must justify the need for expedited processing and cause
     for the short notice in the AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet (SSS). The nomination
     source notifies AF/A1PT that a package requiring expedited processing is in SharePoint.
        3.2.5.1. Nomination packages must contain the following items and be submitted in
        SharePoint.
            3.2.5.1.1. An AF Form 1768, Staff Summary Sheet (SSS), will document, via
            electronic signature, the coordination of the nomination package at the component
            nomination source. The SSS should state that all nominees are eligible for
            appointment and justify expedited processing if required (See para 3.1.4.1.).
            Sample SSS is available in the templates folder in SharePoint.
            (https://cs.eis.af.mil/afdbt/app_scrolling/Lists/Templates/DispForm.asp)
            3.2.5.1.2. A completed nomination list using the template provided by AF/A1PT.
            Sample is available in the templates folder in SharePoint.
            3.2.5.1.3. Completed grade data verification sheets to support nominees entering
            at the lieutenant colonel or colonel.
     3.2.6. Receive component nomination source coordination (see Table 3.2 for component
     coordination levels).
        3.2.6.1. The leadership of each component nomination source may delegate their
        coordination at their discretion.

        Table 3.1. Component Coordination Level

                    Item   Component      Coordination
                      1       RegAF         AFPC/CD

                      3        AFR          ARPC/CC
     3.2.7. Contingent upon further process automation, component nomination source will
     become responsible for collecting and reporting metrics quarterly to AF/A1PT. The
     component nomination source will collect metrics regarding the number of minor and
     major errors identified in each list of nominees provided by the appointment sources
     (Accession source Error Rate) and per appointment source on the number of nominees
     submitted and the number of nominees appointed (Appointment Rate).

            4.1.1.1. The component nomination source leadership (see Table 3.2) may grant
            exceptions to para 4.1.1. at their discretion.
        4.1.2. A nomination package should not be submitted earlier than 8 months before the
        targeted appointment date.
