Supersedes AFMCI21-130, 15 December 2004                                                Pages: 159

This instruction establishes policies and procedures for organic depot level maintenance materiel control,
support, and management of assets within all Maintenance Wings (MXWs) of the Air Logistics Centers
(ALCs) except Nuclear Ordnance Commodity Management (NOCM). Procedures in this instruction per-
taining to data systems that 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group do not utilize are not
applicable. 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group materiel policy is predominately con-
tained in AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual. This instruction implements AFPD 21-1, Air and Space
Maintenance, and AFI 21-102, Depot Maintenance Management. It prescribes forms and reports neces-
sary for effectively executing depot maintenance materiel control. This instruction does not apply to
United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR) or Air National Guard (ANG) members. Ensure that all
records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with
AFMAN 37-123 (will convert to AFMAN 33-363), Management of Records, and disposed of in accor-
dance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located at https://afrims.amc.mil.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This revision updates the procedures, terminology, and responsibilities for depot maintenance materiel
support and control. Document has been divided into three chapters from two chapters. Organization ref-
erences have been changed to reflect the USAF Wing structure. ABOM and NIMMS procedures updated
to reflect system changes since the last revision. New and clarified policies and procedures have been
incorporated for cannibalization, processing of DLA managed aircraft tires and local printing and use of
AFMC Forms 101, Verification of Content Removal and 102, Verification of Content Removal. The
requirement to report NIMMS inventory quantities and BOM status to HQ AFMC has been deleted. The
paragraphs associated with Bill of Material metrics has been reserved pending development of new pro-
cedures.

Section 1B—Automated Information Systems

1.3. The major Automated Information Systems supporting maintenance material control, accounting
and management are described below.
    1.3.1. The Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System (DMAPS) is an integrated suite of
    systems providing material, production, and financial functionality for organic depot maintenance.
    The main DMAPS systems supporting material are covered in the following paragraphs. Additional
    information is contained in AFMCI 65-101, Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production Sys-
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                              9


  tem-Financial Policy and Procedures for Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production Sys-
  tem-Financial Policy and Procedures for Organic Depot Maintenance, Chapter 3.
     1.3.1.1. The Automated Bill of Material (ABOM) system is a front-end validation and order entry
     system to the Naval Air Systems Command Industrial Material Management System (NIMMS).
     ABOM provides on-line batch, single order processing, query capabilities, and administrative
     background programs for maintenance of data. The volume and cost of material used in organic
     depot maintenance is considerable. Proper tracking of these costs is essential to assure effective
     and efficient production and proper financial management. When direct material cannot be identi-
     fied to a specific operation, the individual requiring the material must coordinate with workload
     control (e.g., Planning, scheduling, or work-loading). Ideally, this coordination should occur
     before the transaction is processed. ABOM transactions for direct material are tracked to the oper-
     ations associated with the workload (end item). The detailed ABOM procedures for material sup-
     port functions are contained in the ABOM user manual available from the DMAPS COP.
     1.3.1.2. The Naval Air Systems Command Industrial Material Management System (NIMMS) is
     the accountable system used for the overall management and inventory of DMAG-owned mate-
     rial. NIMMS uses supply principles, policies, and procedures to manage the material to the maxi-
     mum extent possible. NIMMS also shares the database with the Defense Industrial Financial
     Management System (DIFMS) for processing material cost and other financial information. The
     detailed NIMMS procedures for material support functions are contained in the user manual avail-
     able from the HQ AFMC/A4N Depot Maintenance Accounting & Production System-DMAPS
     Community of Practice (CoP).
     1.3.1.3. Defense Industrial Financial Management System (DIFMS). In the Air Force, DIFMS is
     the official financial system of record for organic depot maintenance. DIFMS maintains general
     ledgers; records disbursements, collections, and customer orders; tracks costs; bills customers;
     manages fixed assets; and supports other general management functions in organic depot mainte-
     nance. Instructions are provided in AFMCI 65-101, Chapter 3.
  1.3.2. EXPRESS, D087X, Execution and Prioritization of Repair Support System (EXPRESS).
  EXPRESS is a daily execution system designed to make critical choices in a constrained depot envi-
  ronment. The system takes a fresh view of customer needs and the repair environment daily using cur-
  rent asset and resource information. Visibility of all recoverable National Stock Number (NSNs)
  loaded in the wholesale and retail systems and their location and condition is provided. EXPRESS
  consists of four modules: Data Services, Prioritization, Repair Execution and Distribution.
     1.3.2.1. PARS. PARS prioritize repair and distribution of assets to the users from the source.
     1.3.2.2. EPP. EPP sets priorities for the repair of items that are not addressed in PARS and com-
     bines all priorities into a single integrated list for each repair shop.
     1.3.2.3. Supportability Module. The supportability Module takes the prioritized repair list from
     EPP an determines whether the required items can be repaired based on four evaluation criteria:
     carcass availability, shop capacity availability, repair funds availability and repair parts availabil-
     ity.
     1.3.2.4. Distribution Module. In the distribution module, backorder document numbers are
     matched with EXPRESS prioritized recommendations. EXPRESS creates a file of these matches
     and transmits the file to the Stock Control System, to release assets as they become serviceable.
10                                                               AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


        This process is performed daily. In this manner, item distribution will be accomplished in accor-
        dance with priorities computed by EXPRESS.
     1.3.3. DMMSS (G005M) Depot Maintenance Material Support System identifies material that must
     be pre-positioned to support maintenance workloads and manages the Bill of Material (BOM), which
     is required for planning for material in support of production maintenance workloads, initiating cost-
     ing for the depot maintenance systems, and providing a mechanism to control material usage.
     1.3.4. AMTS (D364) Automated Material Tracking System provides positive control of material via
     barcode tracking, for the United States Air Force (USAF) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)
     DLA supports a bonded warehouse concept in its relationship with the Defense Department. The
     material is owned by the individual DOD services stored, inventoried, and shipped by DLA. AMTS
     provides DMAG receipt data to NIMMS.

                       MATERIAL AND EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT

Section 2A—Production Items

2.1. Aircraft and Missiles. Custodial acceptance and release of aircraft and missiles is performed in
accordance with Air Force Instruction 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribu-
tion, Accounting, and Termination. Production Flight, will ensure update of the Air Force accountable
record in accordance with Air Force Instruction 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization
Reporting.

2.2. Whole Engine. Engine transfers will be recorded in the Air Force Comprehensive Engine Manage-
ment System (CEMS—DSD D042), in accordance with Air Force Instruction 21-104, Selective Manage-
ment Of Selected Gas Turbine Engines and T.O. 00-25-254-1, Comprehensive Engine Management
System Engine Configuration, Status and TCTO Reporting Procedures.

2.3. Management of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR). Transfers of MISTR products are recorded in
the D035K Due-In-From-Over-Haul (DIOH) accounts in accordance with AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part
Two, Chapter 6, Special Depot Supply Support Procedures.

2.4. Manufactured Items. Manufactured items, once completed, are added to the Air Force Inventory in
accordance with AFMAN 23-110 Volume 3 Part Two Chapter 4.

Section 2B—Replacement Parts and Materials

2.5. Exchangeable Items. Exchangeable items (Expendability-Recoverability-Reparability-Category
(ERRC) codes C and T) that are removed from and installed on production items are accountable in
D035K under Due-In-From-Maintenance (DIFM) Due-Out-To-Maintenance (DOTM) controls per
AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Two, Ch 6., Special Depot Supply Support Procedures.

2.6. Expendable Items. Items not subject to repair at depot are issued from D035K for consumption.
These items may be turned in to supply in serviceable condition and added to D035K balances. This
includes bulk items and sheet stock per AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Two.

2.7. Floating Stock. Floating Stock is accounted for in NIMMS.

Section 2C—Storage Areas for Production Owned Material

2.8. The following material storage areas may be established within each maintenance group (MXG).
   2.8.1. Bench Stock. Bench stock may be stored or displayed in various areas, including the Produc-
   tion Flight. The FLS/PMT and/or Supply Tech within the WSSC/SSC/EPSC will manage and replen-
   ish the bench stock bins unless the specific shops and bin locations have been transitioned to
   Integrated Prime Vendor (IPV) contract support. Bench Stock items not managed under IPV will be
   managed in ABOM. Under the IPV support process, the contractor will inventory and replenish the
   bench stock bins. The recommended frequency for non-IPV shops/bins is weekly, however this can be
12                                                                  AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     locally modified depending on the demand. The IPV contractor will be responsible for bin inventory
     and replenishment actions needed to maintain required contract fill rate metrics and performance stan-
     dards. The FLS/PMT or supply tech within the WSSC/SSC/EPSC has primary responsibility for bin
     replenishment, overall maintenance of the bench stock, and issue of items if kept in a controlled area
     for those items not supported by the IPV contract. Specifically, storage locations within the WSSC/
     SSC/EPSC should be used for critical or other sensitive material. The FLS/PMT or supply tech within
     the WSSC/SSC/EPSC will inventory, label, and bin the material in all bench stock locations not under
     IPV contract. The IPV contractor is responsible for inventory, labeling, and bin management in accor-
     dance with IPV contract specifications and provisions.
        2.8.1.1. The FLS/PMT and/or Supply tech within the WSSC/SSC/EPSC will ensure that indirect
        National Stock Numbers (NSNs) are maintained in bench stock and that material is available to
        support maintenance requirements unless management has transitioned to IPV contract manage-
        ment. While under IPV, it is the contractor’s task to replenish bins and perform bin maintenance,
        the IPV Contract Officer Representative (COR) retains overall responsibility to ensure the right
        items are available through coordination with the IPV Technical Assistant (TA), WSSC/SSC/
        EPSC, and IPV contractor. WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel such as the workload manager, PMT,
        wholesale item management specialist (IMS), and FLS should have a thorough understanding of
        IPV procedures to assist production personnel and the COR to insure both routine and expedited
        requirements are satisfied.
     2.8.2. Awaiting Parts (Formal AWP) Production end items AWP will be stored and issued as pre-
     scribed by AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Two. See Section 2N of this instruction for more information.
     AWP occurs when a particular task on an item of production must be stopped or deferred due to a parts
     shortage.
     2.8.3. Awaiting Maintenance (AWM). Production items AWM, production items in delay status,
     routed items, and loan equipment will be segregated, and protected from pilferage and damage. Ser-
     viceable assets will not be co-mingled with unserviceable assets. AWM is the delay between reparable
     asset induction from supply and the start of first maintenance action on that asset. Delay status occurs
     when work on an item of production is stopped due to a resource constraint in labor, facilities, or
     equipment.
     2.8.4. Work in Process (WIP). End items in the repair process are considered a form of WIP and must
     be controlled. Direct and indirect material items that are removed from the end items for repair/reissue
     will be identified, stored, and protected to include prevention of foreign object intrusion as specified
     in AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management, paragraph 14.41.2. See also Sec-
     tion 2M of this instruction for additional information on WIP inventory. Each depot maintenance pro-
     duction shop supervisor (or other designated supervisor) will conduct a complete workload review
     after each work shift to identify leftover residual material and will ensure that such material is turned
     in at the end of each shift to the Shop Service Center (SSC)/Material Supportability Unit (MSU) for
     disposition. If a repair of an end item is interrupted, the Production shop supervisor will ensure that all
     component parts are located with the end item.
        2.8.4.1. WIP does not apply to aircraft parts removed for accessibility during the repair process
        that are addressed by Facilitate Other Maintenance (FOM)/Tail Number Bin (TNB) procedural
        guidance outlined in this instruction.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                           13


  2.8.5. First line aircraft production supervisors have responsibility for the comprehensive effective
  monitoring and disposition of excess aircraft material. AFI 23-111, Management of Government
  Property in Possession of the Air Force describes the property management responsibilities applica-
  ble to all personnel and organizations.
  2.8.6. Supervisor will ensure material ordered by the shop for end item repair does not exceed repair
  requirements. Any material left over from a completed job order/production control number will be
  turned in to NIMMS storage to be held awaiting evaluation for current needs. If repair of an end item
  is interrupted, the production shop supervisor or other designated supervisors will ensure that all com-
  ponent parts for that end item are located with the end item and protected from damage, deterioration
  and intrusion of foreign objects. WIP components and materials must be controlled to ensure excess
  material is not maintained on the shop floor and may use one or a combination of the following meth-
  ods:
     2.8.6.1. Maintain a list (electronic or manual) of WIP (end items, components, material). This
     listing will include the Part number, noun, and quantity as a minimum. If material is not located in
     the immediate shop area, the listing will include and identify the location of that material.
     2.8.6.2. Identify a single location for storage of material held for reinstallation to an end item.
     This location should be identified with the end item’s Serial Number S/N and/or Job Order Num-
     ber JON. The material stored in this location will also be identified with the Part Number P/N and
     noun of the material. The material stored in these locations will not exceed the UPA for the end
     item as outlined in the BOM and/or the Illustrated Parts breakdown (IPB).
     2.8.6.3. Separate material/components and maintain in locations by P/N. These bins will be main-
     tained by the production shop. Each bin location will be labeled with P/N and Noun. NOTE:
     These bins will be for WIP purposes and not bench stock bins.
     2.8.6.4. Facilitate Other Maintenance (FOM). (NOTE: For aircraft only). Direct and indirect
     material removed for accessibility to facilitate other maintenance will be identified, protected in a
     designated FOM storage area. (Note: Identification will be defined as: an electronic or manual list

             2.8.6.6.3. Highlight shelf life and precious metal items the same as bench stock. Items are
             controlled and monitored to avoid ordering assets already on hand.
             2.8.6.6.4. Partially used bench stock items are retained on bench stock and not placed in oper-
             ating/shop stock. Identify, tag, and turn in items with no forecasted use.
         2.8.6.7. Shop Stock. Shop stock is defined as shop operating and housekeeping material required
         for resource cost center operations such as operation of machinery, equipment, and tools. It is clas-
         sified as U6300 material. Shop stock should be stored, protected, condition tagged if applicable,
         separated, and identified in the storage location. See paragraph 2.9.3. for a definition of U6300
         material and paragraph 2.47. for storage and identification requirements of bench stock. Excep-
         tions: U6300 material such as brooms, rags, soap, tags, etc. used for maintaining the shop and per-
         sonnel within the shop need not be controlled as bench stock. Only material and supplies
         consumed in the repair, modification, and manufacture of production items is controlled as bench
         stock.
         2.8.6.8. See also Section 2N of this instruction for additional information on NIMMS storage
         provided by the WSSC/SSC/EPSC. This includes AWP NIMMS store; production NIMMS store
         and local manufacture NIMMS store.

Section 2D—Material Accounting

2.9. Material Classification. The Planner function is responsible for classifying material as direct or
indirect. Standardization of material item classification across MXGs at each ALC shall be maximized.
For control of material and costing purposes, the following classifications of material have been estab-
lished with their associated indirect JONs. Indirect JONs are used to collect costs in the DIFMS system.
NOTE: The Planner strives to minimize the amount of material classified as indirect. Direct material
items are charged against the production number allowing for more accurate identification and collection
of costs/usage for each end item repaired.
     2.9.1. Direct Material. Is material required by and identifiable to a production maintenance job order
     or end item as specified on a Work Authorization Document (WAD) or equivalent. Direct material is
     ordered and charged directly against the end item. Direct material will become a part of the end item
     that is undergoing maintenance or be consumed in the maintenance production process, e.g., heat
     treating, plating, and painting, when the consumed material is peculiar to the item produced. Items
     that must be classified as direct material include: Expendability Recoverability Reparability Category
     (ERRC) C, T, and S, serial number controlled, investment, TCTO kit, organic manufacture items,
     those items classified as direct material in the same cost center (RCC), items that will be maintained
     on the Bill of Material (BOM) with a replacement factor and Unit Per Assembly (UPA), and those
     items considered peculiar or critical that require increased control. ERRC N and P items, depending
     on the application, may be classified as direct if they are issued in unit of issue each, pair, or set. There
     is no minimum or maximum dollar figure that distinguishes a direct material item from an indirect
     material item.
     2.9.2. Indirect Production Material (X56326100000). Production material that becomes a part of the
     product under maintenance or is consumed in the maintenance process, but cannot be readily identi-
     fied to a specific product, or the cost to do so is prohibitive. Examples of such material are bolts, nuts,
     washers, common use paints, etc. The cost of such material is charged to all end items within a cost

  center on an apportionment basis. Indirect material will always be ERRC N or P. Indirect material
  cannot be ERRC C, T, or S items. Indirect material shall include all bulk units of issue (gallons, feet,
  pounds, etc.), unless it meets the criteria for being peculiar or critical to the end item (requiring
  increased control) in which case it should be planned as direct material. Indirect material is not man-
  datory to be on a BOM since it does not compute a replacement percent, reflect usage, or compute
  toward the End Item Sales Price. However, to maintain visibility of all material required for a particu-
  lar job, indirect material may be included as a nonstandard record in the BOM.
  2.9.3. Shop Operating Material (X56336300000). Material required for resource cost center (RCC)
  operations, e.g., material used in operation, repair and preventive maintenance of machinery, equip-
  ment and tools; supplies incidental to repair, modification, and manufacture of production items; and
  supplies for maintaining cleanliness of shops and production personnel.
  2.9.4. Office Supplies (X56366400000). Material, such as pencils and paper, required to perform
  administrative functions or maintain office operations.
  2.9.5. Aviation POL (Non Flying) (X56116511000). Petroleum, oils and lubricant (POL) products
  issued by the Fuels Division and used in the Depot Level Maintenance (DLM) repair or overhaul pro-
  cess other than those used in operation of shop machines, equipment, and tools. This Includes ground
  POL products classified as General Support Division (GSD) material, and aviation fuels used in
  engine test and flight test.
  2.9.6. Ground POL (X56126512000). Gasoline and oil consumed by maintenance vehicles and
  ground power equipment obtained from Fuels Division, AFSF.
  2.9.7. Special Fuels (X56136513000)
  2.9.8. Tools and Equipment Expense. Production tools, tools accessories, and equipment other than
  office equipment, having a unit cost of less than $100,000, or a unit cost of more than $100,000 with
  a useful life of less than two years.
     2.9.8.1. Expendable Tools and Equip (X56346610000). All hand tools issued through the tool
     crib for mechanics' tool kits and their accessories (all 5100 and 5200 Federal Stock Classes (FSCs)
     such as drill bits, hacksaw blades, rotary files, etc.).
     2.9.8.2. Tools and Accessories (X56396620000). Equipment and their associated machinery type
     tools, tooling and accessories.
     2.9.8.3. Equipment Machinery (X56396630000). This includes all other tools.
     2.9.8.4. Expendable Office Equipment (X56356700000). Expense office equipment having a unit
     cost of less than $100,000.
  2.9.9. Material-Defective Work and Spoilage (X56406800000). The Technology Repair Center
  (TRC) is responsible to restore defective items to a serviceable condition. Rework consists of restor-
  ing an end item to a serviceable condition when that item was repaired by the TRC, placed into stock,
  and found to be defective to the TRC's workmanship or use of faulty or improper handling. Use the
  cost code L for expense material, and cost code B for exchangeable material.
  2.9.10. Facility Preventive Maintenance and Repair (X56376910000). Repair, modification, or con-
  struction support to production maintenance.

Section 2E—Material Transaction Procedures

2.10. Transactional Procedures. The following policy affects material transaction procedures.
     2.10.1. Direct expense material is charged to a specific workload by RCC, production number, JON
     suffix, operation number or task, and cost code at the point of issue.
     2.10.2. Indirect expense material is billed to the Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG) at the
     point of issue from depot supply. Such material will be ordered through ABOM. Inventory control
     will be under NIMMS. Bench stock material is billed under IPV by the IPV contractor on a monthly
     basis based on contractor direct vendor deliveries to the actual MXG shop bins.
     2.10.3. Items with an ERRC code of C or T and a procurement source code 1 or 2 are considered
     exchange items and subject to DIFM/ DOTM control.
     2.10.4. The following statements pertain to managing indirect material. This includes bench stock,
     shop stock, work order residue, and kit residue in production maintenance. This policy is directed in
     an effort to prevent discarding serviceable material, encourage cost effective retention, and to prop-
     erly use Air Force assets. Do not discard items just to show consumption. They are valuable assets.
     Because of their worth in dollars and utility, these assets will not, under any circumstances, be indis-
     criminately discarded, used in an unauthorized manner, or wasted.
        2.10.4.1. Residue from work orders or expense material which can be identified to a stock or part
        number can be retained, if a future need exists. The material must be returned to the designated
        WSSC/SSC/EPSC location (bench stock or inventory store in NIMMS). Under no circumstances
        is the material to be maintained on the shop floor.
        2.10.4.2. Unserviceable Vehicle Tires ERRC P (XF3), and residue from kits, which can be iden-
        tified to a stock or part number must be turned into supply using NIMMS turn-in procedures for
        Found on Base (FOB) with D6A type transaction X and cost code M or N. Maintenance will not
        receive a credit or non-credit adjustment in this situation.

Section 2F—General Material Issue and Turn-in Processing

2.11. General. This section tells how to process material transactions except those processed in relation
to Nuclear Ordinance Commodity Management (NOCM). The Directorate of Special Weapons will
establish and maintain local guidance for NOCM items that is compatible with the D035K system.

2.12. Front End Edits. The processing of material to and from the MXGs requires discipline and discre-
tion. The front-end edit process within ABOM is an important tool in preventing the issue of direct mate-
rial that is excess to production requirements. It is used to ensure job costs are accurate and to minimize
inapplicable inventory growth.
     2.12.1. Overrides. ABOM front-end edit capabilities will be used. In order to effectively manage
     material, control cost, and increase BOM accuracy, the override capability provided in the ABOM
     BOM Management functionality requires strict review and approval as outlined in paragraph 2.12.2.
     Use of the BOM Management functionality is permissible when the actual depot maintenance mate-
     rial requirement to perform each required depot operation does not coincide exactly with G005M
     replacement factor quantities/percentages resulting from unpredictable mechanic maintenance
     demands. Fixer or Planner approval is required if the quantity ordered exceeds the planned quantity
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                              21


   per assembly (QPA) for the specific material in question. Since G005M is the system of record,
   updates to ABOM BOM information is a temporary measure. Each day, G005M information is over-
   laid in ABOM. Therefore, any permanent BOM changes must be entered in G005M.
   2.12.2. Authority. The shop supervisor is ultimately accountable for material usage and direct mate-
   rial costs in their shop. The following are the minimum requirements for overrides: The WSSC/SSC/
   EPSC (PMT/Forward Logistics Specialist (FLS)) will inform the Planner of each ABOM override
   using the BOM management functionality. The Planner will validate the requirement. If the requested
   amount of material exceeds the UPA, the override approval authority resides with the Fixer. The shop
   supervisor will be informed of all disapprovals.
   2.12.3. Periodic Reviews. The Fixer will assure ABOM JON front-end edits are not being bypassed
   through inappropriate use of ABOM Non-BOM screens, direct entry to D035K or other
   work-arounds. The Fixers and shop supervisors are responsible to ensure policy regarding BOM man-
   agement is being followed.

2.13. Assignment of Document Numbers. ABOM automatically assigns a document number, which
includes the current Julian date and a serial number. ABOM facilitates DIFM/DOTM transactions
through on-screen matching before generating a new ABOM assigned document number. The NIMMS
Daily Valid Transactions Report (PCN: MN155R01) includes all transactions for direct and indirect
material. The FLS/PMT and Supply tech should also refer to the ABOM Verify function (F6) for addi-
tional information on processed and rejected transactions.

2.14. Turn-In of Excess ERRC N or P consumable Material. Local procedures will be developed to
provide the simplest, most efficient methods to turn-in excess or unserviceable ERRC N or P items.
   2.14.1. Turn-in categories. Serviceable, unserviceable, and unidentifiable ERRC N or P material will
   be turned in using the following four categories.
       2.14.1.1. ERRC N or P serviceable material. This type material will be turned in to the NIMMS
       Store, WSSC/SSC/EPSC, or returned to bench stock, as applicable.
       2.14.1.2. ERRC N or P non-serviceable and scrap material. This type material the user has deter-
       mined to be unserviceable and beyond repair.
       2.14.1.3. Unidentified material. Items in this category are those items awaiting identification and
       disposition to the ERRC P/N serviceable area or to the ERRC P/N non-serviceable/scrap material
       area, or are awaiting identification for use in the production process. Periodically, but no less than
       every 10 days, WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel will inspect the items in the unidentified material bin
       and provide identification services. When necessary, coordination will be made with production.
       Appropriate MXG personnel will assist as necessary in identifying this material and will decide if
       these items can be used in the production process or if they are to be turned into the supply
       account.
       2.14.1.4. Aircraft tires managed by DLA source of supply "SMS" and ERRC code "P".
   2.14.2. Procedures. Local procedures will be developed to provide the simplest, most efficient meth-
   ods to turn-in excess or unserviceable ERRC N or P items.
   2.14.3. Guidelines.
22                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


        2.14.3.1. All excess serviceable material will be turned in to the NIMMS Store if there is a future
        requirement. Otherwise excess material will turned in to depot supply.
        2.14.3.2. The only items that may be disposed of as trash are items that have no potential value to
        the government through future use or resale by the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office
        (DRMO). This includes those items in their current configuration, including the basic material
        content, and that have no value (e.g., used gaskets or seals, broken plastic lenses, used light bulbs,
        etc).
        2.14.3.3. Unserviceable items, those not eligible for reconditioning or repairing, and those items
        that fail the identification process will be turned in as scrap by production either directly to
        DRMO, or through the WSSC/SSC/EPSC. The preferred method is to use the WSSC/SSC/EPSC,
        who will prepare the documentation and arrange for transportation to DRMO.
        2.14.3.4. Unserviceable tires managed by DLA and subject to retread shall be turned in to supply
        using NIMMS FOB procedures. These tires will be source of supply "SMS" and ERRC code "P".
     2.14.4. Pick-up points. The MXGs will establish and maintain turn-in and pick-up points for service-
     able or unserviceable ERRC N or P material. Each point will be conspicuously marked to show the
     RCC authorized to place material there.
     2.14.5. Demilitarization/Mutilation.
        2.14.5.1. Demilitarization (Demil) coding is a part of the cataloging program. The process of
        determining and assigning the appropriate Demil code to all national stock numbered (NSN)
        items, when the items are cataloged, is essential to ensure that items are properly demilitarized
        during the disposal process. The Demil code is applicable to and assigned to the full range of
        items. The DOD owning activity is responsible for determining the Demil code for all property in
        their possession. The DRMO is responsible for ensuring that it is properly demilitarized when
        required. Demilitarization done by depot maintenance is based on the assigned Demil code and
        must be accompanied by an AFMC Form 206, Temporary Work Request, to cover cost of the
        Demil action. Refer to DOD 4160.21-M-1 for additional guidance.
        2.14.5.2. Mutilation. The act of mutilation should not be confused with demilitarization coding or
        the demilitarization of materiel. Mutilation results in the complete destruction of an item (it must
        be done by the generator) whereas Demil is designed to prevent materiel from being used for its
        originally intended military or lethal purpose. It also applies to materiel in unserviceable or ser-
        viceable condition that has been screened through the inventory control point (ICP) and declared
        surplus or foreign excess. The Demil code identifies the degree of demilitarization necessary prior
        to accomplishing final disposition of the item. A prime Material Manager (MM), the inventory
        management specialist or the equipment specialist must always direct mutilation by memo, mes-
        sage, or by annotating the AFMC Form 206. Defective items, parts, and components containing
        latent defects dangerous to public health and safety are required to be mutilated prior to turn-in to
        the DRMO.
     2.14.6. Repair of ERRC P/N items. When production believes an ERRC P or N item could be eco-
     nomically repaired beyond what is currently authorized, they will, in conjunction with engineering
     planning, prepare the required request for authority to repair, as follows:
        2.14.6.1. To update the TO and the SMR code, if necessary, a change request, should be submit-
        ted in accordance with TO 00-25-195, AF Technical Order System Source, Maintenance and
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                             23


       Recoverability Coding of Air Force Weapons, Systems, and Equipments. A suggestion, AF Form
       1000, IDEA Application, may also be initiated and forwarded through the suggestion program.
       2.14.6.2. The recommended item will not be held pending SPM and prime MM approval of the
       SMR code and TO changes.
       2.14.6.3. The following directives apply, TO 00-25-195; AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part Three;
       AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part Four; and AFMAN 23-110, Volume II, Part Two.
   2.14.7. Credit. The SSC/EPSC-IM/WSSC/EPSC FLS will ensure that items eligible for a credit
   turn-in are identified, and that DMAG is credited from the sale of scrap. Include a DMAG fund cite on
   DD Form 1348-1A, DOD Single Line Item Release/Receipt Document.

2.15. Material Transaction Processing and Cost Corrections. All material requests and turn-in trans-
actions will be processed through ABOM and/or NIMMS to record activity between the MXGs and the
WSSC/SSC/EPSC and/or depot supply. These transactions are used to change the accountability records
of government property as it changes ownership from the MXGs to supply. These transactions are also
used to determine the cost of material charged to customers, update end-item production from which data
is obtained to bill customers for completed work, maintain completeness and replacement parts accuracy,
and project valid parts requirements to supply.
   2.15.1. Material Support Responsibilities. The accurate and timely processing of material transac-
   tions is the responsibility of the FLS/PMT and/or Supply Tech within the WSSC/SSC/EPSC's. Since
   data from these material transactions is eventually passed to multiple Air Force and DoD systems, it is
   imperative that all transactions be validated before being processed. The financial well being of the
   Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG), is dependent, largely, on the accuracy of these material
   transactions, therefore, the importance of valid data cannot be over-emphasized.
       2.15.1.1. The group resource advisor will reconcile material issue requests/receipts to billing
       records to ensure all material has been received for which maintenance has been billed (FLS/PMT
       and/or Supply Tech within the WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel will provide assistance, as needed).
       This will occur once a month and will be accomplished by reviewing the DIFMS financial mate-
       rial error reports. Center FM organizations shall be notified where it is necessary to correct finan-
       cial records. Records of the monthly review will be maintained by the applicable group resource
       advisor.
   2.15.2. Requests.
       2.15.2.1. Material required by production will be requested by the appropriate maintenance/pro-
       duction personnel through the supporting FLS/PMT and/or Supply tech within the WSSC/SSC/
       EPSC. The FLS/PMT and/or Supply tech uses ABOM to process material orders.
       2.15.2.2. All direct material requests are edited by ABOM to assure the item requested applies to
       the production item being repaired, and is ordered against the correct JON (12 position), operation
       number, RCC, and the UPA. Maintenance/production personnel requesting material will provide
       NSN or part number, quantity, SRD, and their name. These may be annotated on AFMC Form 95,
       Issue Request (see Attachment 4) or equivalent. When the material is issued, a document with the
       price of the material will be provided to allow price challenges where warranted.
24                                                               AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


        2.15.2.3. When ABOM indicates an item is not planned for the production number, or is being
        requested for a quantity that exceeds the UPA, the FLS/PMT and/or Supply tech within the
        WSSC/SSC/EPSC will:
            2.15.2.3.1. Print or electronically transmit ABOM screen, such as the ABOM Permanent or
            Single Order Response Screen. The ABOM Verify functionality also has a set of screens and
            reports to support this process. Documentation (hard copy or electronic format) will be pro-
            vided to the Planner.
            2.15.2.3.2. The PMT/FLS will process the requisition transaction only after the edit override
            process in paragraph 2.12.1. has been carried out and the proper level of approval received.
            This is usually accomplished by the Planner returning the ABOM screen print to the PMT/FLS
            for processing. Should Planner opt to direct non-BOM ordering, the Planner must provide
            written authorization to the Technician.
     2.15.3. NIMMS Receipting via MN031P Screen. Each request submitted through ABOM that creates
     a material due record in NIMMS requires a receipt transaction. When material is received, the mate-
     rial due record must be cleared by a receipt transaction. This is done automatically when material is
     issued from the supporting forward supply point and when material is in-checked through AMTS.
     When material is received from any other supply point, a manual or barcode receipt is required and
     generally done by receipting into AMTS. Costing, in DIFMS, is done at the time material is received;
     therefore, a receipt transaction must be performed for each shipment. The receipt transaction is also
     used to establish an accounts payable, which is later matched to an incoming bill.
        2.15.3.1. If a receipt has been processed with incorrect data, the receipt transaction needs to be
        reversed. This is done by entering the receipt information and an ‘R’ in the REV field and then
        receipt with correct data if required. NIMMS generates financial transactions to DIFMS. See
        user's manual for detailed instructions. A correction in D035K may also be required.
     2.15.4. Turn-ins.
        2.15.4.1. Line turn-in of serviceable ERRC N or P material will be given, by production/mainte-
        nance personnel, to the FLS or PMT who will use the appropriate NIMMS screen to process the
        transaction.
        2.15.4.2. Excess material, floating stock or spares (exchange material) will be turned in to the
        WSSC/SSC/EPSC who will use the appropriate NIMMS screen to process the transaction.
        2.15.4.3. Indirect material. See Section 2J.
        2.15.4.4. Exchange material DIFM/DOTM. See Section 2H.
     2.15.5. Material Cost Corrections. Material cost corrections will be a MXG responsibility accom-
     plished by the MXG resource advisor (the servicing WSSC/SSC/EPSC will provide assistance as
     needed). In order for the data in the cost systems to be valid, suspended and erroneous transactions
     must be corrected daily. Difficult or unusual transactions should be coordinated with designated
     financial personnel to ensure correct accounting procedures are followed. Records cannot be removed
     or deleted without a thorough review by financial personnel (usually Cost Accounting).
     2.15.6. Management Analyst in Material Supportability Section. Will assist DIFMS financial ana-
     lysts in correcting suspended reflected on the DIFMS reports 7310-412, Daily Material Expenditures
     By Job Number will be reviewed to detect questionable transactions not rejected by edit. The review
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                            25


   will concentrate on unusually large charges, incorrect RCC, and incorrect JON control number, etc.
   Corrections will be annotated as applicable and forward to the responsible MXG for input to the sys-
   tem.
   2.15.7. Cost Accounting. After the DIFMS/NIMMS material cost listings are validated, cost account-
   ing will review the annotated listings and assure the necessary changes are input to DIFMS/NIMMS.
   For an explanation of screens, queries and reports refer to the DIFMS user manual, Appendix G,
   Material, and the NIMMS user manual, Section 9, Error Suspense Function in Appendix E, Report
   Samples. Place emphasis on correcting material in transit (MIT) errors identified in DIFMS reports.
   2.15.8. Once an error is submitted for correction, any of the following reports will be reviewed to ver-
   ify corrective action was taken. For additional reports and related screens/queries, see the DIFMS and
   NIMMS user manuals.
       2.15.8.1. NIMMS report MN155R01, Daily Valid Transactions.
       2.15.8.2. DIFMS report 7310-412, Daily Material Expenditures By Job Number.
       2.15.8.3. DIFMS report 7310-427, Weekly Material Expenditures Distribution By Direct Job
       Order.
       2.15.8.4. DIFMS report 7310-469 – Aged Material In Transit – Received a bill or credit bill from
       D035K; receipt or turn-in not processed, or, cost on receipt or turn-in does not match bill.
       2.15.8.5. DIFMS report 7310-472 – Aged accounts payable – Receipt for material processed but
       no bill has been received. Do not work anything from the prior month.
       2.15.8.6. DIFMS report 7310-478 – Aged accounts receivable – Turn-in processed but have not
       received a credit bill or cost on credit bill does not match turn-in.
       2.15.8.7. DIFMS report 7310-484 – Aged unmatched bill – Received bill but has no matching due
       or receipt.
       2.15.8.8. DIFMS report 7310-495 – Material Mismatched – Excessive variance in bill, credit bill
       and receipt and turn-in.

2.16. Internal Controls for Material Issues.
   2.16.1. Policy. Each MXG will develop an issue certification process. The issue certification process
   must be in writing and conform to the following guidelines:
   2.16.2. The shop supervisor must certify material is issued to a job. The shop supervisor will certify a
   requirement exists for material at the time the material is ordered. This will be accomplished through
   use of the normal ABOM edits. Note: Use of the override capability with respect to ABOM BOM
   Management functionality is permissible when the actual depot maintenance material requirement to
   perform each required depot operation does not coincide exactly with G005M replacement factor
   quantities/percentages resulting from unpredictable mechanic maintenance demands. This will pre-
   clude the need to complete unnecessary override actions, which provide no meaningful benefits to Air
   Force maintenance personnel while increasing assigned workload duties. It is understood that in most
   instances this will not result in orders exceeding the maximum quantity specified in G005M. Group
   commander or Fixer approval is formally required if the quantity ordered met or exceeded the planned
   quantity per assembly (QPA) for the specific material in question.
26                                                                AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     2.16.3. Requisitions are considered certified if they do not trigger an exception in ABOM as shown in
     the Verify functionality. Procedures in paragraph 2.12. shall be used to approve requisitions using the
     override capability provided in the ABOM BOM Management functionality, including requests for
     material not carried on the BOM. The FLS/PMT and/or Supply tech within the WSSC/SSC/EPSC will
     process requisitions for material only after they have conducted their own internal checks for correct
     production number, and operation number. This check is important to BOM accuracy to prevent erro-
     neous costing and usage to the wrong production number and/or operation number. The PMT/FLS
     will override the normal ABOM edits only after receiving the proper approval from the planner as
     found in paragraph 2.12. Since G005M is the system of record, update to ABOM BOM information
     is a temporary measure. Each day, G005M information is overlaid in ABOM. Therefore, any perma-
     nent BOM changes must be entered in G005M.
     2.16.4. Documentation. The DIFMS Report 7310-412; Daily Material Expenditures By Job Number
     can be used, as the documentation required certifying that the material issued is the material required
     for the job being worked. An initialed ABOM screen print is adequate to document overrides.
     2.16.5. The Fixer will be responsible for enforcing the issue certification process.
     2.16.6. Periodic Reviews. The local MXW will perform annual audits of each MXG to ensure a writ-
     ten policy is in place and that certification is occurring according to prescribed guidelines. If
     non-compliance is found, then corrective action must follow and audits should be increased to
     semi-annually or quarterly until compliance is indicated.

2.17. Backorder Management. AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Two, Chapter 5 and AFMCM 21-3, Vol.
3, Exchangeables Production System (G402A) (Users Manual) provides the policy for effective backo-
rder management through the establishment of management responsibilities and criteria for backorder
reconciliation and cancellation. This involves the joint coordination/cooperation of the MXGs, WSSC/
SSC/EPSC, and depot supply. Under DMAPS, there's an interface from D035K to NIMMS that allows
backorder validation on the NIMMS due-in records and proper synchronization of backorders in both sys-
tems. This process is also used to update Estimated Delivery Dates (EDDs) and priority changes not gen-
erated by NIMMS. Coordinate cancellation with engineering planning and Fixer. Ensure backorders are
canceled or file maintained prior to JONs moving to a JON status 2. Backorders in excess of the quantity
required to support the number of end items on work will be determined to be excess and must be can-
celed.
     2.17.1. Backorder Reconciliation/Cancellation. It is the responsibility of production supervisors to
     notify the WSSC/SSC/EPSC of any requirements that no longer exist as soon as the fact becomes
     known and follow up with the WSSC/SSC/EPSC as required. Two methods are provided to effect a
     cancellation, as follows.
        2.17.1.1. Daily: Use the NIMMS reports MN244R02 and MN244R03 for backorder validation.
        The PMT/FLS reviews the reconciliation report for incoming backorder file against material due
        records that do not match against document number, quantity, stock number, and status. If the base
        movement (BM) is less than 5 days, those records appear on the MN244R01 report.
        2.17.1.2. Monthly review and cancellation.
            2.17.1.2.1. The monthly D035K Backorder Details file (Table SCD-REPO-REC) provides
            the data to perform backorder validation on the NIMMS due-in records. The interface allows
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                        27


         for proper synchronization of backorders in both systems. In both systems, reports are sorted
         on document number and page break is by UIC. The reports generated include:
             2.17.1.2.1.1. Shipment in Process.
             2.17.1.2.1.2. Material released 5 days or less.
             2.17.1.2.1.3. Not in NIMMS.
             2.17.1.2.1.4. Backorder in D035K, no Due in NIMMS.
             2.17.1.2.1.5. Not in D035K.
             2.17.1.2.1.6. Due in NIMMS, no Backorder in D035K.
             2.17.1.2.1.7. Validation Error/Overdue Shipment Report.
         2.17.1.2.2. Determine backorder disposition. Based on the report, the PMT/FLS takes appro-
         priate action for backorder reconciliation and disposition.
         2.17.1.2.3. Use NIMMS screen MN021P, Material Due Update, for processing. This transac-
         tion allows for maintenance of NIMMS Material Due Records. The Material Due Quan-
         ity-Due may be increased or decreased, selected fields may be changed, or the entire record
         may be deleted. This transaction also allows ‘Purchase Data’ such as the Material Due Record
         Purchase Order Number (PON), the Accounting Classification Reference Number (ACRN),
         Contract COST-CODE and Unit Price for commercial (Material Account Code—MAC ‘P’)
         material dues.
         2.17.1.2.4. Use NIMMS screen MN123P, NIMMS Backorder Modify/Cancel, for adjust-
         ments. This application allows on-line maintenance of Backorder (Material Due) records and
         informs D035K of changes to each backorder. The program builds outgoing Military Standard
         Transaction Reporting & Accounting Procedure (MILSTRAP) messages and makes a record
         of the transaction in the NIMMS transaction record area.
  2.17.2. No Charge For Cancellation. The customer will not be charged and the backorder will be can-
  celled if the following conditions exist.
     2.17.2.1. No stock fund due in is established.
     2.17.2.2. The Source of Supply (SOS) will allow cancellation without penalty.
     2.17.2.3. The quantity of the stock fund due out can be absorbed within the supply stock levels.
     2.17.2.4. There is another customer who can use the material. If the pending cancellation can be
     accomplished without penalty from the SOS, the backorder will be systemically cancelled with a
     BQ status advice code output to the customer.

2.18. Teardown Deficiency Report (TDR) Processing (Reference AFMAN 91-222 and AFMAN
91-223).
  2.18.1. General. AFMC must ensure the quality of procured items and products produced with
  organic resources. It is necessary for prime wholesale Item Management Specialists (IMS)/MMs
  working with workload managers to be aware of the quality of items in the Air Force inventory. This
  sometimes involves the withdrawal of material from the inventory to test, inspect, teardown, etc., to
  determine the actual condition, quality, or functionality of a part or assembly. This may be accom-
28                                                                   AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     plished by initiating a temporary work order specifying analytical evaluation and submission of a
     TDR.
     2.18.2. Policy. After the request and approval of a TDR has been received, production personnel will
     requisition and turn-in items to support it.
     2.18.3. Responsibilities.
         2.18.3.1. Production will be responsible for the following actions.
             2.18.3.1.1. Assign a maintenance group monitor for TDRs received.
             2.18.3.1.2. Establish suspense files.
             2.18.3.1.3. File the work requests/project directives and a copy of the G004L-L3A, Tempo-
             rary Job Record, by Material Improvement Project (MIP) number.
             2.18.3.1.4. Ensure TDR documentation is completed and forwarded to the appropriate item
             manager.
         2.18.3.2. The SSC/EPSC workload manager will schedule exhibits into the appropriate produc-
         tion squadron shop based on assigned priorities.
     2.18.4. Turn-in of material will be in accordance with applicable paragraphs in Chapter 2 based on
     the type of material.

2.19. Deficiency Report (DR) Exhibit Processing.
     2.19.1. Introduction. Process DR exhibits using the prescribing T.O. 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency
     Reporting and Investigation System. Policy in this paragraph together with T.O. 00-35D-54 shall be
     used to ensure funding, analysis, report preparation, rework (if applicable) and/or return to service is
     accomplished in a timely manner to support the customer. Information contained in this paragraph
     does not replace policy contained in the prescribing T.O.
     2.19.2. General. Deficiency Report exhibits should be scheduled, inducted, and investigation initiated
     within 15 days of receipt at the ALC receiving and storage activity. Exhibits investigations shall be
     completed as expeditiously as possible, but not later than 20 days after receipt of Category I deficien-
     cies and 30 days after receipt of Category II deficiencies.
     2.19.3. Guidance. Exhibit investigations should be performed ahead of repairs of like MISTR items;
     therefore EXPRESS should not drive nor preclude the investigation process, unless required to satisfy
     MICAP demands. EXPRESS should be used once the investigation is complete to assist in determin-
     ing if a requirement exists to return the asset to a serviceable condition. If repair is authorized, exhibits
     will be returned to serviceable condition as soon as possible by processing them ahead of like MISTR
     items. The logic is that once the exhibit analysis is complete the asset can be efficiently returned to
     serviceable condition.
         2.19.3.1. The support point will establish a method to monitor the status of DR investigations to
         ensure timely investigation, analysis, and trending. TO 00-35D-54 specifies requirements for pro-
         viding exhibit investigation analysis results to the DR action point to prevent deficiency recur-
         rence.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                             29


     2.19.3.2. DR analysis and report preparation (investigation) is always funded by the prime ALC
     regardless of the ultimate findings. The prime ALC is the ALC that manages the asset in question.
     The repair ALC will not perform DR investigations without being reimbursed.
  2.19.4. Investigation and Restoration Policy For Un-Programmed Work. Un-programmed work is
  defined as any exchangeable workload where the repair ALC does not have an established permanent
  control number. This most commonly occurs where the repair ALC does not have the assigned work-
  load responsibilities. A temporary JON on the type “6” project order is established and an AFMC
  Form 206 issued by the technical focal point (e.g. MM, equipment specialist, quality specialist, prime
  IM etc.) to pay DMAG for investigations and/or any required work to return it to a serviceable condi-
  tion. AFMC Form 206 must be received prior to restoration process from the prime IM. The exception
  is where the investigation finds that the repair ALC is at fault (workmanship). The cost of conducting
  the investigation is still chargeable to the prime ALC, however, the cost to return the asset to a ser-
  viceable condition is charged to the repair ALC as rework (ALC absorbs costs). Direct charges to the
  customer are prohibited.
     2.19.4.1. Investigation and restoration policy for programmed work. Programmed work is
     defined as any exchangeable workload where the repair ALC has an established permanent con-
     trol number. The JON established for processing these items will have a job designator "G"
     assigned. The labor standard for the “G” job designator will cover the investigation (analysis and
     the report preparation); no repair is authorized (no rework hours in the labor standard) on these
     permanent JONs with the "G" designator. Following the investigation, if the repair activity was
     not at fault for the deficiency and requirement exists to restore the asset to a serviceable condition,
     the repair ALC should “wash-post” from the analysis job order (“G” job designator) to the
     exchangeable repair/overhaul job order (“A” job designator). This ensures all expenses/revenues
     move to the “A” job and the customer is charged. If the repair activity is at fault (workmanship),
     the repair of the item (if a requirement exists) is accomplished using the “G” job designator as
     rework. Since the “G” job designator does not include rework hours in the labor standard the ALC
     absorbs this cost. Production count is not taken, direct labor costs are charged to the RCC where
     performed and direct material is charged to U6800 or U6812, as appropriate. Rework expense is
     recorded, but the customer is not charged. See paragraph 2.19.4.5. for further rework guidance.
     2.19.4.2. The Temporary Work Request process is not to be used for conducting investigations
     and restoring assets to a serviceable condition for programmed work on a normal basis. The only
     exception is where the scope of the investigation exceeds the “normal” DR analysis and report
     requirement covered using the JON with “G” job designator. In this instance, the repair activity
     should request that the IM fund the extra expense using the AFMC Form 206.
     2.19.4.3. For Deficiency Reports (DRs) evaluated on a permanent production number the DMAG
     has the option to do one of the following:
         2.19.4.3.1. Develop a control number with “G” job designator for each item worked in a given
         shop. This may be required in shops with a wide variety of items where the labor standard and
         cost for evaluation would differ greatly.
         2.19.4.3.2. Develop a control number with a “G” job designator for each shop/customer com-
         bination (i.e., develop one control number funded by WR-ALC for MAPG9L and one control
         number funded by OC for MAPG9L). Shops with only one customer would only have one DR
         control number while shops with 5 customers would have 5 control numbers under this option.
30                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


            The key is the proper shop earns hours and dollars and the proper customer pays for the eval-
            uation.
        2.19.4.4. If the RCC (shop) was not able to duplicate the reported deficiency and the unit passed
        all functional test requirements, the unit will be condition tagged as serviceable and returned to the
        supply system. Wash-post procedures will not be used. This applies for both programmed and
        un-programmed work.
        2.19.4.5. Rework of DR Exhibits. When the analysis of the DR exhibit determines that the RCC,
        where the work was accomplished, was not at fault, the effort to restore the exhibit to a serviceable
        condition will be accomplished by that RCC as new work (using wash-post procedures to the “A”
        job designator as described above). When the analysis of the DR exhibit determines that the RCC
        where the work was accomplished was at fault, the work to restore the exhibit to a serviceable con-
        dition will be accomplished by that RCC as rework.
            2.19.4.5.1. For those items undergoing rework production count will not be taken. Induct
            exhibit into repair process using the “G” job designator for permanent workloads or approved
            AFMC Form 206, for un-programmed workloads. Un-programmed workloads shall be
            inducted within 15 workdays of approval. Process exhibits ahead of routine production for like
            items. Follow locally established time criteria for items under the Two Levels of Maintenance
            concept.
            2.19.4.5.2. The material used in rework will be charged to U6800 with cost code "L" for those
            items normally costed under codes "A", "L", or "R"; to U6800 with cost code "X" for those
            items normally costed under codes "E" or "J", and to U6812 with cost code "G" for those items
            normally costed under codes "B" or "G" (blank job designators in all cases).
     2.19.5. ALC Reported DRs. When a deficient item is discovered by an ALC directorate user from an
     ALC directorate repair line, the item must be processed with proper notification to the prime ALC. No
     work will be accomplished on these items without proper prime ALC direction. When an ALC direc-
     torate initiates a DR on material provided or repaired by another RCC (shop), the above procedures
     apply. When the directorate management elects to correct the deficiency without the prime or manag-
     ing ALC direction, the item will be processed and expensed as rework. Any direct material used will
     be charged according to the same instructions for the rework of PQDR exhibits described above. No
     earned hour credit to a JON or charges to a customer will be made.
        2.19.5.1. Policy for costing DR MISTR Workload. Each quarter an AFMC Form 181, Project
        Order, will be issued by the prime ALC (where the materiel management function is located) to
        cover this workload. Each repair ALC performing this type of workload must receive the AFMC
        181 from each prime ALC.
        2.19.5.2. Documentation. To provide a proper audit documentation trail, written notification of
        the exhibit numbers, by NSN, must be provided to the processing MXG. This notice may be main-
        tained centrally or in the responsible Workload Manager’s file per local option. A DD Form 2332,
        Product Quality Deficiency Report Exhibit, will accompany each exhibit sent to the repair ALC
        for processing (no exhibits will be accepted for processing by the repair ALC without the DD
        Form 2332). A copy of the DD Form 2332, and the communications notice (message or other) is
        sufficient information for an audit trail.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                                 31


2.20. Reporting Packaging and Handling Deficiencies. W h e n p a c k a g i n g / h a n d l i n g d a m a g e a s
described in AFJMAN 23-215, Reporting of Supply Decrepancies, is discovered, the MXG noting the
damage will notify the FLS or PMT who will then immediately notify the DLA receiving function about
the problem. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC will assist the DLA packing and materials handling personnel in
completing required entries on SF Form 364. The DLA receiving function is responsible for overall mon-
itoring, controlling, final preparation, and routing of SF 364.

2.21. Processing Material Received with Discrepancies.
   2.21.1. General. This paragraph establishes policy for resolving discrepancies found in material
   received from DLA and/or WSSC/SSC/EPSC. Discrepancies include, but are not limited to, wrong
   quantity, misidentification, erroneous unit cost, wrong condition code, defects and damage.
   2.21.2. Policy. In general, DLA deliveries are to be funneled into the WSSC/SSC/EPSC. The WSSC/
   SSC/EPSC material expeditor will deliver individual parts to the appropriate shop. In short, the
   WSSC/SSC/EPSC is responsible for checking all inbound property on behalf of the Fixer. This policy
   is found in AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Two. The following guidance is supplemental and intended
   to address those situations where discrepancies are noted by maintenance. Material receipts inspected
   and found to be discrepant will require submission of SF Form 364 to a locally established single con-
   trol point for analysis (whether or not the DD Form 1348-1A). This control point must be a coordi-
   nated effort between the MXG, the WSSC/SSC/EPSC, and DLA organizations. Local directives must
   contain guidelines to assure sufficient data is reflected on the SF Form 364.
   2.21.3. Responsibilities/Guidance. Each MXG will establish, implement, and enforce receipt certifi-
   cation procedures within the following guidelines.
       2.21.3.1. Items received from the WSSC/SSC/EPSC and/or DLA should be inspected, where
       practical, for discrepancies prior to signature receipting.
       2.21.3.2. Material en route or delivered will not be left unprotected at any point. It will be secure
       under observation by responsible personnel at all times.
       2.21.3.3. Material for turn-in will not be released until it has been properly receipted for by the
       WSSC/SSC/EPSC and/or applicable DLA organization.
       2.21.3.4. Issue and turn-in document receipting will be accomplished promptly.
       2.21.3.5. All direct line issues are receipted through AMTS. Research should be performed to
       determine the cause of discrepancy if the material was lost.
NOTE: Replace Signature Of Issues, Turn-Ins Require AMTS Process.
       2.21.3.6. Since the presence or absence of receipt certification documentation may affect the final
       disposition of the item, the production organization and WSSC/SSC/EPSC will retain a copy of all
       documentation associated with these type occurrences.
       2.21.3.7. The original packaging with labels and tags will be included with all items returned to
       supply.
       2.21.3.8. Corrective action must be initiated within 5 workdays after discovery of a discrepancy
       and accomplished within 20 days after the issue or backorder release date.
32                                                               AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     2.21.4. Discrepancies Found Prior to Signature Receipting. Contact the available WSSC/SSC/EPSC
     representative in the material receiving area to take the necessary action for resolution of problems
     discovered in that area. Do not sign the DD Form 1348-1A. A SF Form 364 (or a locally established
     form) must be initiated by whoever discovered the discrepancy.
     2.21.5. Defective Material Found After Signature Receipting.
        2.21.5.1. Instructions. MXG personnel, in coordination with the quality control activity, will
        return the items to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC and/or DLA distribution for credit as follows.
            2.21.5.1.1. Send a letter or memo to appropriate SMAG manager (e.g., GSD, or MSD) stating
            the requirement for credit on the defective material received. The request for credit must con-
            tain the NSN, quantity received, and dollar value involved. SMAG manager concurrence must
            be received before any other actions are taken.
            2.21.5.1.2. Process a turn-in transaction using the procedures from paragraph 2.67.3.3.
     2.21.6. Discrepancies. Other Than Defective Material Found After Signature Receipting. This type
     discovery can occur at any time up until the component's end item has passed final acceptance.
        2.21.6.1. Return the item to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC for processing. WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel
        will verify the discrepancy, attach a copy of the original DD Form 1348-1A and return the items
        to the supply account. Discrepant material should not be turned into supply without supporting
        documentation (SF Form 364 and DD Form 1348-1A) that identifies the discrepancy. Process a
        turn-in transaction using the procedures from paragraph 2.67.3.2.
        2.21.6.2. WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel and DLA inventory personnel will work together to
        replace the items if available. If assets are not available, WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel should
        reverse the request and create a backorder, provided the Fixer wants one. The reversal will create
        a forced credit to DMAG. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC Chief shall track, monitor and control forced
        credits to ensure they are not abused.

2.22. Supportability and Parts Shortage Reports.
     2.22.1. Systems. Several tools exist to assist in parts supportability. ABOM provides WSSC/SSC/
     EPSC personnel and maintenance/production personnel with a material support posture of all compo-
     nents required to meet production requirements and those unavailable to support end items. This capa-
     bility gives WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel and the supply material expediters a tool to expedite critical
     items and work stoppage components to prevent future line stoppages or high priority requirements
     from processing. Reference paragraph 2.12. for information on ABOM JON front end edits. Under
     DREP, EXPRESS is used to prioritize repair and distribution of assets and to identify constraints
     affecting the repair process. The supportability module of EXPRESS takes the prioritized repair list
     and determines whether the required items can be repaired based on carcass availability, repair parts
     availability, funding, and shop capacity. The Reparability Forecast Model (RFM/D357) provides
     parts supportability tools for the entire spectrum of depot maintenance. RFM can be used to produce
     reports showing those NSNs that will be unsupportable in the next 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 120
     days, and 120+ day increments. RFM is also the command-approved system to provide forecasts of
     piece part requirements up to 36 months into the future to DLA. Please refer to AFMCI 23-108, Fore-
     casting Direct Material Requirements for specific guidance on RFM forecasting and parts support-
     ability processes.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                             33


   2.22.2. Instructions. The workload manager located in the SSC/EPSC, or the workload supportability
   chief located in the WSSC/SSC/EPSC will identify those end items which are in work or which are
   scheduled during the ensuing production period.
   2.22.3. Responsibilities.
       2.22.3.1. The SSC/EPSC (materiel planner, RIM, and workload manager) and WSSC/SSC/EPSC
       (planner, retail item manager, and supportability specialist) activity will review shortage quanti-
       ties for each component line item after it is determined which end items require expeditious action
       in order to prevent curtailing production.
       2.22.3.2. The SSC/EPSC (materiel planner, RIM, and workload manager) and WSSC/SSC/EPSC
       (planner, retail item manager, and supportability specialist) activity will ensure special action for
       the shortage is taken only on items in work or planned to be scheduled into the maintenance shops
       during the ensuing production period.

Section 2G—Control of Items Requiring Special Handling

2.23. Classified Material and Related Documents.
   2.23.1. Classified documents are processed and filed according to AFI 31-401, Information Security
   Program Management. Document retention is prescribed by DoD 5200.2-R, Information Security
   Program, AFI 37-138, Records Disposition—Procedures and Responsibilities and AFMAN 23-110,
   Volume 1, Part One, Chapter 19.
   2.23.2. Only individuals identified by appropriate receipt authorization may receive property that has
   a security classification.
   2.23.3. Classified materiel must be completely declassified prior to turn-in to the DRMO. Normally,
   the specific T.O. for the item or system will provide declassification/demilitarization instructions;
   however, the inventory control point (ICP) must be contacted for assistance when the T.O. is not
   available. Basic declassification/demilitarization guidance is provided in DoD 4160.21-M-1, Appen-
   dix 4, Defense Demilitarization Manual. It is essential that we emphasize to all affected personnel that
   the classified part(s) or component(s) of an item must be removed or destroyed prior to release of the
   materiel to the DRMO. The fact that an item is condemned, (beyond economical repair), is not a sat-
   isfactory substitute for actually performing the declassification/demil actions. After declassification,
   all references to the classification must be removed or obliterated.

2.24. Resource Protection. Conservation and protection of government materials is the responsibility of
all government employees.
   2.24.1. The security program for material stored in WSSC/SSC/EPSCs is provided in AFMAN
   23-110, Volume 3, Part Two, Chapter 6.
   2.24.2. Ensure all personnel are aware of and comply with local regulation in support of Air Force
   project waste-busters, programs established by local functional area chiefs, and other resource conser-
   vation programs.
   2.24.3. Ensure personnel comply with appropriate unpacking methods and container reclamation.
   2.24.4. Develop procedures to prevent the inadvertent disposal of salable or salvageable government
   assets and material. The following guidelines apply:
34                                                             AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


      2.24.4.1. Disposal areas for reusable containers, pallets, wooden crates, trash, scraps, etc., must
      be clearly marked. Serviceable and reparable items must be kept away from these areas.
      2.24.4.2. Reusable containers will be inspected and verified as empty before they are processed
      out of maintenance to reclamation. AFMC Form 101, Verification of Content Removal Tag, and
      AFMC Form 102, Verification of Content Removal label, are appropriate for verification that con-
      tainers are empty. A single AFMC Form 101 or 102 may be used on unitized or consolidated loads
      of empty containers in lieu of an AFMC Form 101 or 102 on each individual container. Local
      printing is authorized to preprint repetitive information.

2.25. Control and Review of High Priority Material Requests. High priority requests (UND A and B,
see Attachment 7) require periodic review by MXW management to assure essentiality and to prevent
degradation of the priority system.
   2.25.1. Responsibilities.
      2.25.1.1. The MXWs will appoint a monitor as a focal point to:
          2.25.1.1.1. Establish, together with the WSSC/SSC/EPSC, control limits for priority requisi-
          tions.
          2.25.1.1.2. Establish local policy and procedures.
          2.25.1.1.3. Identify and evaluate the activities submitting an unusually high number of sus-
          pect priority requisitions.
      2.25.1.2. The Group monitors will:
          2.25.1.2.1. Screen the D035K daily UMMIPS listing (PCN: A-D035K-BD8-DA-L75) and
          keep group management apprised of trends.
          2.25.1.2.2. Conduct periodic reviews of the UMMIPS listing and advise group management
          of suspected priority system abuse.
          2.25.1.2.3. Conduct periodic review of work-stop reporting to the IPV contractor ensuring
          compliance with the guidelines in 2.25.4. below.
36                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     2.25.2. Instructions.
        2.25.2.1. Management Review of Material Requests. The daily UMMIPS listing will be provided
        for MXW management review of all Urgency of Need Designator (UND) A and B issue requests
        processed the preceding day that resulted in backorders. During review by the group monitor, the
        following type requests will be highlighted to the group commander for further review and correc-
        tive action:
            2.25.2.1.1. Indirect (X56326100000) material replenishment requests.
            2.25.2.1.2. Shop operating (X56336300000) material replenishment requests.
            2.25.2.1.3. Repetitive priority requests for planned material. AWP backorder requests require
            at least a B3 priority for D035K acceptance.
        2.25.2.2. Plan of Action. When the priority rates are deemed exceptionally high, production man-
        agement will provide a plan of action to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC Chief which will ensure the pro-
        posed priority rates are properly validated.
     2.25.3. MICAP/Work Stoppage. During programmed depot maintenance (PDM), if an aircraft
     requires parts that are unavailable, it may be necessary to increase the priority of the material request
     within the assigned PDM workload. See AFMAN 23-110 Volume 1, Part One, Chapter 2, Paragraph
     2.29.6 for MICAP reporting of aircraft possessed by depot maintenance (depot field teams (DFT) or
     PDM.
        2.25.3.1. Transactions between the MXG and supply will be processed in ABOM /NIMMS and
        passed to D035K. After input, verification of the process will be made with the WSSC/SSC/EPSC
        MICAP function.
        2.25.3.2. If the MICAP is satisfied through local cannibalization action, then the MXG will
        downgrade the MICAP request and obligate the request to the robbed aircraft/end item.
        2.25.3.3. Responsibility. The Fixer within the MXG will be responsible for the performance of
        the MICAP and high priority program. MICAPs will require Fixer coordination with WSSC/SSC/
        EPSC personnel, the SM, and prime MM.
     2.25.4. Bench Stock Outages. When an IPV bin is found empty by production personnel, at least one
     of the following conditions must apply in order to declare a work-stoppage on the IPV contractor’s
     website:
        2.25.4.1. AIRCRAFT:
            2.25.4.1.1. The part is not available and there are no workarounds and the aircraft is unable to
            move to the next production cell.
            2.25.4.1.2. The part is not available and there are no workarounds and the aircraft is unable to
            move to functional test.
            2.25.4.1.3. The part is not available and there are no workarounds and the aircraft is unable to
            move out of functional test.
            2.25.4.1.4. The part is not available and there are no workarounds and the total flow-days will
            be extended.
        2.25.4.2. COMMODITIES.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                                37


           2.25.4.2.1. The part is not available and there are no workarounds and the operation cannot be
           completed.
           2.25.4.2.2. The part is not available and there are no workarounds and the total production
           time will be extended.
           2.25.4.2.3. The part is not available and there are no workarounds and the production line will
           be shut down.
       2.25.4.3. AVIONICS.
           2.25.4.3.1. The part is not available and there are no workarounds and the operation cannot be
           completed.
           2.25.4.3.2. The part is not available and there are no workarounds and the total production
           time will be extended.
           2.25.4.3.3. The part is not available and there are no workarounds and the end item will go
           into AWP status. A backorder is established in ABOM as a holding place to enable the shop to
           move the EIDN to formal AWP pending receipt of required component needed to repair the
           AWP EIDN. Once the component part is received and the EIDN is now supportable, the TA
           will cancel the backorder and provide to the AWP Technician. The AWP Tech will update
           ABOM and as soon as the move notice is generated and the EIDN is inducted into the shop,
           the AWP Tech will issue the part to the shop.
       2.25.4.4. ENGINES/PROPULSION.
           2.25.4.4.1. The part is not available and there are no workarounds. As a result, whole engines,
           modules, or components cannot be produced to support the monthly requirement.
NOTE: "workarounds" include cannibalizations.

2.26. Critical Item Control. The SSC/EPSCs use EXPRESS for induction of high priority repair
requirements and the identification of parts problems and production constraints on a daily basis. This
process ensures correct priority discrepancies are expedited. Informal and formal DREP meetings are
used to ensure the depot repair process is on track, seek methods of support improvement, and apply the
necessary resources to get the job done. During these meetings the top 10 problem items (these are most
likely AWP items) as a minimum are reviewed. The Supportability Analysis and Visibility (SAV) auto-
mated data management system will provide: (1) the visibility to track EXPRESS requirements; (2)
projects asset availability (based upon historical support) of those requirements; (3) the capability to iden-
tify and resolve asset constraints (six primary constraint categories with 22 subcategories (includes AWP)
and then tracking the identified support constraints until all identified constraints are removed or satisfied;
(4) worldwide weapon system asset visibility to ensure weapon system asset support is on track with
EXPRESS requirements and other needed support; and (5) the visibility of asset historical support/issues.
The SAV capability identifies and labels assets impacting weapon system as Readiness Drivers. This
capability in SAV is called the Readiness Driver Process. The Readiness Driver Program as well as its
procedural process will be further developed after the availability of SAV.

2.27. Sensitive Item Control.
   2.27.1. General. Sensitive items must be controlled, secured from pilferage, and provided to produc-
   tion personnel on an as-required basis. When sensitive items are delivered to production, they will be
38                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     marked SENSITIVE ITEM. Signatures are required when issuing and turning in sensitive items. The
     following sensitive item codes are applicable:
     2.27.2. Code Description.
     P. Ammunition and Explosives
     Q. Narcotics
     R. Precious Metals (limited to items that contain enough precious metals to make the removal of such
     metal economically attractive).
     2.27.3. Responsibilities. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC is responsible for controlling sensitive items pro-
     cessed by their respective units. Production shop personnel must participate in the effective control
     and use of sensitive items.
     2.27.4. Instructions.
        2.27.4.1. Upon receiving a sensitive item from the WSSC/SSC/EPSC, maintenance/production
        personnel will sign and date a copy of the delivery document.
        2.27.4.2. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC function will file it in the completed document file. A copy will
        also be furnished to the production shop for their records.
        2.27.4.3. Maintenance/production personnel will stamp or mark SENSITIVE ITEM on all copies
        of the turn-in documents when turning in sensitive material. The MXG will obtain the signature of
        the WSSC/SSC/EPSC person who accepts the sensitive item, retaining a copy in the completed
        document file for 90 days.

2.28. Processing Storage Restriction Items.
     2.28.1. General. Explosive and armament items; AF Form 2692, Aircraft/Missile Equipment Trans-
     fer/Shipping List; and other items subject to regulatory storage restrictions while end items (primarily
     aircraft) are undergoing repair will be turned in and withdrawn from hold storage areas using AFMC
     Form 959, Work Control Document. This applies to items removed by production, temporarily stored
     by supply or production, and later reinstalled by production (AFMAN 23-110, Volume 3, Part Two).
     Explosive items may be stored temporarily in production areas certified by the Safety Office. (NOTE:
     Refer to AFMCI 21-110 for description of a Work Control Document).
     2.28.2. Responsibilities. It is the responsibility of the WSSC/SSC/EPSC to maintain control over all
     hold storage items for the shop being supported. Production personnel are authorized to handle explo-
     sive and armament items in the shop environment. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC will assist the production
     shop in completing and maintaining the documentation listed in the following paragraph.
        2.28.2.1. The aircraft manager or production shop supervisor who has control of the end item will
        take the following actions.
            2.28.2.1.1. Prepare work control document for all storage restriction items removed from end
            items. Three copies are initiated for each line item.
            2.28.2.1.2. Ensure items are properly prepared for storage.
            2.28.2.1.3. Notify Workload Manager/Aircraft Logistics Specialist (ALS) when the items are
            required for reinstallation.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                         39


      2.28.2.2. Workload manager/ALS will perform the following actions.
          2.28.2.2.1. Notify the WSSC/SSC/EPSC to pick up removed items and place them in storage.
          2.28.2.2.2. Notify the WSSC/SSC/EPSC when and where to deliver the items.
      2.28.2.3. The applicable production section is responsible for the following actions:
          2.28.2.3.1. Maintain control over the hold storage area.
          2.28.2.3.2. Ensure safe handling and storage procedures are followed.
          2.28.2.3.3. Maintain a file of signed and dated AFMC Forms 959 for all items in temporary
          storage. This file copy may have additional instructions as to location of removed items.
          2.28.2.3.4. Attach one copy of AFMC Form 959 to the removed items. The third copy of
          AFMC Form 959 is given to production, if the storage area is controlled by production.
          2.28.2.3.5. Upon request from workload manager/ALS, deliver the required items at the time
          and location specified.
          2.28.2.3.6. Coordinate with workload manager/ALS any delays encountered in delivery.
          2.28.2.3.7. Maintain a file of all copies of AFMC Form 959 for items no longer in storage
          until the end item is sold or turned in to depot supply.

2.29. Expedite Redistribution Orders (RDOs) for Production Items.
   2.29.1. General. The prime MM issues RDOs against supply for MXG production items that are
   available or will be available for turn-in. The following actions must be taken to satisfy urgent
   requirements.
   2.29.2. Responsibilities. Only appropriate SSC/EPSC personnel will commit items for RDO process-
   ing. The SSC/EPSC notifies the shop supervisor concerning items committed for RDO processing and
   the shop supervisor identifies the items to the SSC/EPSC when the item is ready for turn in. The shop
   supervisor ensures the shop produces the item. The workload manager completes necessary documen-
   tation, identifies the item as express item, and holds it for pickup by the SSC/EPSC expediter. The
   SSC/EPSC expediter holds the item for DLA pickup.
      2.29.2.1. The prime MM will:
          2.29.2.1.1. Contact the appropriate workload manager for the TRC/RCC to determine when
          the required item will be available for pickup from the shops.
          2.29.2.1.2. Contact the servicing SSC/EPSC for the same TRC/RCC and provide name, tele-
          phone number, and organization of the MXG person who was contacted regarding the avail-
          ability of the asset.
          2.29.2.1.3. Preposition release of asset in D035A.
      2.29.2.2. Workload Manager will:
          2.29.2.2.1. When contacted by the prime MM, commit items for RDO processing after deter-
          mining the time and date the item will be ready for delivery from MXG. Also, provide the
          name, telephone number, and organization of the MXG person to be contacted by the SSC/
          EPSC.
40                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


            2.29.2.2.2. Upon notification by the production shop supervisor that the item has been pro-
            cessed, prepare the turn-in document and notify DLA that the item is available for pickup.
            2.29.2.2.3. The supervisor will ensure the shop releases express items immediately upon com-
            pletion in order that workload manager can turn them in.
        2.29.2.3. The SSC/EPSC will pickup the RDO item from the shop and carry it to the turn-in area.

2.30. Disassembly and Reclamation.
     2.30.1. Disassembly. Disassembly at the ALCs is the authorized removal of an assembly, subassem-
     bly, or component part from end items still on property accounting records in the Air Force inventory.
     Disassembly will be accomplished at the direction of the responsible IM, for return to stock or for
     shipment to another station. In all cases, the end item is returned to supply stock in an incomplete sta-
     tus. This work, normally done in the MXG shop, may be done in an area designated by supply in the
     case of large or bulky end items.
     2.30.2. Reclamation. Reclamation is the recovery of parts for further use from end items or excess
     assemblies. Parts removed by reclamation are generally not replaced and the end item may not be
     identifiable for turn in.
        2.30.2.1. Policy. Reclamation will be used instead of procurement or repair whenever measurable
        savings will result. It will also be used, after considering cost with the prime MM, whenever it
        provides the quickest means of satisfying MICAP or other critical item requirements, or when
        there is no other known source of supply.
        2.30.2.2. Use of Other Directives. Reference AFMAN 23-110, Volume VI, DOD 4160.21-M,
        Defense Reutilization and Marketing Manual, AFMCI 23-111, Reclamation of Air Force Prop-
        erty, and AFMCI 21-156, Operational Workloading, Planning & Scheduling Control.
     2.30.3. Responsibilities to Accomplish Disassembly or Reclamation.
        2.30.3.1. Prime MMs will issue AFMC Form 206 to the responsible production planning function
        that will prepare the AFMC Form 237, Temporary Labor and Material Plan, and send it to the
        appropriate workload manager in the SSC/EPSC.
        2.30.3.2. The workload manager/workload supportability chief will review the work request and
        job order, evaluate the required shop resources and the shop resources already committed to other
        workloads, and schedule the job order into the shop. Workload manager/workload supportability
        chief will then requisition the items to be disassembled from the WSSC/SSC/EPSC and maintain
        status of the project until completed. Actions will be coordinated between the WSSC/SSC/EPSC
        and production shop.
        2.30.3.3. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC will maintain items in temporary storage when a CRI is estab-
        lished within the WSSC/SSC/EPSC until the workload manager/workload supportability chief
        requests them.
        2.30.3.4. The production shop will work on the item, condition tag the parts and end items, list
        parts removed on the back of the DD Form 1577-2, Unserviceable (Reparable) Material Tag, and
        return all parts and end items to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                       41


     2.30.3.5. Parts required by maintenance will be processed through the SSC/EPSC. End items and
     components not retained in the MXG will be turned in to the SSC/EPSC using the appropriate
     condition code.
  2.30.4. Instructions for Disassembly and Reclamation.
     2.30.4.1. The prime MM will:
         2.30.4.1.1. Initiate the AFMC Form 206.
         2.30.4.1.2. Send the AFMC Form 206 to the MXG engineering planning function.
     2.30.4.2. The MXG engineering planning will process a G004L-L3A and deliver the work pack-
     age to the applicable workload manager/workload supportability chief, using an L job designator.
     2.30.4.3. The workload manager/workload supportability chief for the production shop accom-
     plishing the disassembly/reclamation will:
         2.30.4.3.1. Receive the work package from the planner.
         2.30.4.3.2. Review resources required to accomplish the disassembly/reclamation, shop
         resources available, required completion date, and assign a priority or a projected start and
         completion date to the work.
         2.30.4.3.3. Advise the WSSC/SSC/EPSC to deliver the items together with the G004L-L3A,
         Temporary Job Record to the shop when disassembly/reclamation is to be accomplished.
         Close out the work when the project is complete.
         2.30.4.3.4. Maintain status and location of the project until completed.
         2.30.4.3.5. Schedule the items into the shop and arrival of the end items in the MXG.
         2.30.4.3.6. Notify the WSSC/SSC/EPSC to receive parts and end items from the production
         shop.
         2.30.4.3.7. Close out the work package when the project is completed.
     2.30.4.4. WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel supporting the disassembly/reclamation production shop
     will:
         2.30.4.4.1. Deliver end items from supply.
         2.30.4.4.2. Maintain end items in the WSSC/SSC/EPSC or temporary storage area until
         requested by workload manager/workload supportability chief.
         2.30.4.4.3. Deliver end items and G004L-L3A to the production shop when directed by work-
         load manager/workload supportability chief.
         2.30.4.4.4. Receive end items, removed parts, and G004L-L3A from the shop.
         2.30.4.4.5. Turn in reclaimed parts according to disposition instructions in block 19 of the
         AFMC Form 206.
     2.30.4.5. Production shop accomplishing the disassembly/reclamation will:
         2.30.4.5.1. Receive end items and G004L-L3A from the WSSC/SSC/EPSC or depot supply
         and remove parts from end items as specified on the G004L-L3A.
42                                                                  AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


            2.30.4.5.2. Identify and condition tag removed parts. Turn in disassembled or reclaimed parts
            according to disposition instructions in block 19 of the AFMC Form 206. These instructions
            must not allow maintenance to gain financial credit for the turn-in of reclaimed parts. To
            ensure this does not happen, utilize the G402A turn-in screens (paragraph 2.67.3.) for the
            parts using the Production Section/Scheduling Designator (PS/SD) in the document number,
            the temporary control number, L job designator, and H cost code with the condition code as
            directed by the prime MM on the Form 206.
            2.30.4.5.3. Tag the disassembled end item, condition code E or F as appropriate and turn it in
            to supply. Condition code will be determined by the prime Repair Technician, Equipment Spe-
            cialist, or Engineer or be directed by the prime MM or IMS. List removed parts on the back of
            the DD Form 1577-2, Unserviceable (Reparable) Tag Material. Reclamation instructions on
            the AFMC Form 206 may not require a turn in for the end item, but may direct the disposal of
            scrap.
            2.30.4.5.4. Small reclaimed items with low dollar amount can be kept on the shop floor if it is
            indicated on the AFMC Form 206 by the prime MM to do so. These items will be owned by
            maintenance but will be maintained by SSC/EPSC using the same procedures as specified for
            the controlling of bench stock.
            2.30.4.5.5. Notify the workload manager/workload supportability chief that disassembly/rec-
            lamation is complete.
     2.30.5. Maintenance Groups. Product directorates are authorized to remove and retain parts when it
     proves cost effective and possess the authority to reclaim parts from an end item when it is in the best
     interests of the Air Force at their option. When a decision is made to reclaim material items, mainte-
     nance production personnel will ensure the reclaimed parts are turned in and located with the Material
     Supportability Unit (MSU) or equivalent organization when the following conditions apply: 1.) there
     are measurable and justifiable cost savings 2.)there is no other source of supply for the material, to sat-
     isfy a MICAP 3.) a part is no longer procured 4.) when there is a long lead time on the component part,
     5.) when it is mission essential 6.)when there is an actual forecasted future need for the part 7.) the
     parts will still meet the approved weapon system and/or commodity technical and specification engi-
     neering requirements. MPS may be used in the interim period to account for the reclaimed material to
     ensure consumption and tracking ability are maintained.

2.31. Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment and Loan Property.
     2.31.1. General. Before issuing test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment or loan property, the
     MXG must receive authorization from depot supply. Requests for test, measurement, and diagnostic
     equipment are submitted to the Equipment Management Office (EMO) for approval and accountabil-
     ity. Test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment are recorded on EMO accountable records. The
     prime MM approves loan property. Air Force property can be loaned to organizations to satisfy
     short-term unique requirements. Loan material should be returned in the same condition as issued.
     2.31.2. Responsibilities. Property custodians are accountable for test, measurement, and diagnostic
     equipment and loan property issued to the MXG upon their request. When test, measurement, and
     diagnostic equipment are authorized and assembled in the MXG, there must be a production turn-in
     and subsequent equipment issue, both of which may be accomplished on paper only. Issue requests for
     S and U ERRC coded items are submitted according to AFMAN 23-110, Volume 3, Part Two.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                         43


   Accountability is the responsibility of the appropriate production shop. Unauthorized assembly of
   test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment or use of loan assets can seriously jeopardize material
   support and asset accountability. Non-EAID issue requests are processed by other supply functions.
   2.31.3. Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment Instructions.
      2.31.3.1. The MXG will establish planning teams that will:
          2.31.3.1.1. Determine how many test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment are required.
          2.31.3.1.2. Notify appropriate production shop of requirements.
      2.31.3.2. Production shop will:
          2.31.3.2.1. Prepare AF Form 601, Equipment Action Request, for required test, measurement,
          and diagnostic equipment or test standards listing all components needed to support a specific
          system.
          2.31.3.2.2. Forward AF Form 601 to EMO.
NOTE: EMO will process AF Form 601 to the SCM and or prime MM for approval and assignment of
NSN or control number. Upon approval of SCM and or prime MM and assignment of NSN or control
number, EMO will initiate and process AFMC Form 206 for assembly or organic manufacture of equip-
ment.
          2.31.3.2.3. Assemble organically manufactured test, measurement, and diagnostic equipment
          and test stands as scheduled.
          2.31.3.2.4. Applicable programs and workload activity will process AFMC Form 206 assign
          control number, and forward it to the appropriate engineering planning office.
      2.31.3.3. The appropriate engineering planning function will:
          2.31.3.3.1. Receive and process AFMC Form 206 and prepare G004L-L3A and the WAD.
          2.31.3.3.2. Forward copy of work package to the appropriate workload manager/workload
          supportability chief.
      2.31.3.4. Workload manager/workload supportability chief will forward copy of G004L-L3A to
      the WSSC/SSC/EPSC for necessary material request action.
      2.31.3.5. WSSC/SSC/EPSC will:
          2.31.3.5.1. Receive G004L-L3A from the workload manager/workload supportability chief.
          2.31.3.5.2. If bench set is to be assembled or organically manufactured in the MXG, then
          material and components listed on the G004L-L3A will be requested.
          2.31.3.5.3. Notify workload manager/workload supportability chief when material and com-
          ponents are available.
          2.31.3.5.4. Receive loan property and deliver to requestor.
   2.31.4. Loan Property Instructions.
      2.31.4.1. MXG planning teams will:
          2.31.4.1.1. Determine loan property required.
44                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


            2.31.4.1.2. Obtain written permission from the Air Force prime MM for Air Force managed
            investment assets. This approval may consist of an AFMC Form 206 a Memorandum Of
            Agreement, or other written permission. The Chief of Supply may approve the loan of other
            assets. Notify the appropriate WSSC/SSC/EPSC chief of requirements for loan property.
            2.31.4.1.3. MXG planning team personnel will notify WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel of
            requirements for loan property and include return date.

2.32. Control of Cannibalization Actions. Policy and procedures contained in this paragraph pertaining
to cannibalization actions are not to be confused with reclamation procedures contained in AFMCI
23-111, Reclamation of Air Force Property.
NOTE: It is recognized that the ability of the Supply Chain Management (SCM) Material Manager
(MM) to support Air Force Depot Maintenance production schedules is dependent upon the capability of
Depot Maintenance/Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to meet required production schedule/quantity
commitments to the MM. However, the intent of this policy is to ensure that accounting is recorded for all
required Cannibalization actions necessary to satisfy operational MAJCOM customer needs.
     2.32.1. General. Cannibalization actions in support of the Depot Maintenance operations are consid-
     ered workaround processes that are utilized solely to bridge supply system gaps in providing parts.
     They are inefficient and drive up the total cost of depot maintenance. The use of cannibalization shall
     be minimized. Cannibalizations are a burden to depot maintenance because the costs to perform them
     are absorbed by depot maintenance overhead. Costs are not fully recovered until future years when
     sales prices are adjusted to account for inefficiencies.
        2.32.1.1. Generally, cannibalization may utilize donor assets that are inducted in maintenance
        (DoD Financial Management Instruction defines this as Rob-Back) or donor assets that have been
        issued into maintenance using reclamation issue and turn-in procedures. Cannibalizations will
        only include back ordered items/parts on planned operations that are greater than 48 hours old.
        The intent is to satisfy a part requirement that cannot be satisfied through the normal supply sys-
        tem. Depot maintenance activities are not authorized to induct assets (exceeding the net repair
        objective, or negotiated quantity as the situation fits) to rob as a source of supply for repair parts
        not available through normal supply channels.
        2.32.1.2. WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel must make every attempt to plan for situations where a
        cannibalization action may be required and provide as much time as possible for the SCM (prime
        MM/IM) to react to the situation and explore other workarounds, in accordance with attached
        checklist (may be accomplished by electronic equivalent). Cannibalization is one of the last meth-
        ods for satisfying the part requirement. This means WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel should plan to
        make requests during normal Monday through Friday shifts if possible, and avoid weekend
        actions when SCMs and/or MM/IMs may not be on duty. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel must
        provide the delivery requirement and the reasons for the date on all cannibalization requests. Pro-
        duction delivery schedule is a valid reason that the SCM (prime MM/IM) is expected to acknowl-
        edge and comply with when evaluating cannibalization requests. Requests for cannibalization that
        are not tied to a specific production delivery schedule are not candidates for approval.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                            45


Figure 2.3. Cannibalization Checklist.




      2.32.1.3. Budgeting/Funding. Semi-Annual budget forecasting must be developed and submitted
      by the required Maintenance Community at each center for cannibalization actions. Maintenance
      Groups are therefore required to interface with SCM/IMs and Equipment Specialists to ensure
      timely and accurate forecast are submitted in DMAG fiscal year budget requests. A formal coordi-
      nation process will be established at each ALC to accomplish this task and ensure rates will reflect
      the cannibalization expenses.
   2.32.2. Cannibalization of Inducted Items. Cannibalization of inducted items is the removal of an
   installed assembly, subassembly, component, or part from one inducted item for use on another item
   with the intention of replacing it. Cannibalization of inducted items approval and execution is internal
   to depot maintenance. The Maintenance Group Chief (or their designated representative) makes the
   decision as to the level of coordination required. Approval for Cannibalization of inducted items is
   within the authority of the MXG. A Cannibalization of inducted items occurs when a component
   ordered against an End Item/End Item Document number has to be file maintained to another End
   Item/End Item Document number because the component was robbed as applicable. A Cannibaliza-
   tion of inducted items does not occur if the benefiting and donating JON suffixes are the same. MM/
46                                                                AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     IM and Fixers are authorized to use Cannibalization of inducted items procedures to obtain needed
     parts from end items inducted to meet a funded repair objective if they meet the criteria in paragraph
     2.32.1.1., paragraph 2.32.1.2., and paragraph 2.32.1.3. Fixers are not authorized to over-induct end
     items (beyond the funded repair objective) for the express purpose of cannibalizing parts. Cannibal-
     ization procedures shall be used when a donor asset is not available from among inducted work.
        2.32.2.1. Cannibalization of inducted items should only be accomplished after all other attempts
        to obtain the needed parts by the WSSC/SSC/EPSC have been exhausted. MXGs shall develop
        procedures to track the occurrences of Cannibalization of inducted items in each RCC or mainte-
        nance squadron and maintain the data for at least one year. This information will be used to pro-
        vide visibility of which depot maintenance organizations are being forced to conduct
        Cannibalization of inducted items and any trends in Cannibalization of inducted items. The infor-
        mation can then be used to help solve supply support problems with SCMs and as supporting doc-
        umentation at DREP, AREP, or Production Council meetings. The goal should always be zero
        Cannibalization of inducted items.
        2.32.2.2. Cannibalization of inducted items. The Cannibalization of inducted items between dif-
        ferent JONs requires transactions be accomplished in NIMMS screen MN026P, Back-robbing
        Transaction. This transaction allows for transfer of Material Due Record requirements by chang-
        ing the Material Due Record JON/Shop from a donor JON/Shop to a benefiting JON/Shop and
        creating financial records charging the benefiting JON and crediting the donor JON. The Material
        Due Record is updated immediately upon transmission of the update screen. The backorder must
        also be file maintained in D035K. The labor expended to remove the robbed part and install the
        replacement part must be charged to the benefiting cost center as an overhead expense.
        2.32.2.3. AWP Cannibalization of inducted items. Procedures to accomplish Cannibalization of
        inducted items for the line supported by a WSSC/SSC/EPSC are contained in AFMAN 23-110,
        Vol. 3, Part Two, and AFMCI 21-129 and 21-133. The procedures require transactions to be
        accomplished in ABOM AWP Module. An AWP cannibalization of inducted items occurs when a
        component ordered against an End Item Document number has to be file maintained to another
        End Item Document number because the component was cannibalized.
        2.32.2.4. The Workload Manager/ALS for the benefiting shop will coordinate the proposed
        action with the Workload Manager/ALS for the donating shop. If a decision to cannibalize is
        made, the benefiting Workload Manager/ALS will request that servicing WSSC/SSC/EPSC pre-
        pare the necessary documentation.
        2.32.2.5. The servicing WSSC/SSC/EPSC for the benefiting shop will prepare all necessary
        paperwork and transactions and obtain approval of the WSSC/SSC/EPSC Chief.
        2.32.2.6. The donating and benefiting shops will schedule the work with the WSSC/SSC/EPSC
        Workload Manager or WSSC/SSC/EPSC ALS. The benefiting shop will obtain the part with the
        documentation package. The donating ALS inputs required transactions into PDMSS. The bene-
        fiting Production Support Technician/Workload Manager enters all required transactions into
        NIMMS.
     2.32.3. The SCM (prime MM/IM) may approve an item be drawn from supply for cannibalization of
     a part. The processing outlined in paragraph 2.32.3.1.1 applies with the exception that reinstallation
     action may not be required. The SCM (prime MM/IM), organization may direct that the component
     removed will not be ordered/installed, but rather the turn-in of the end item with a specified condition
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                             47


  will be made identifying the cannibalized part on the back of the condition tag. If reinstallation is
  directed, the request must state if the cannibalized end item is to be controlled and processed as a seri-
  alized condition code G (AWP) item. A D6A or D6R turn-in transaction will be processed. If the car-
  cass is to be managed as AWP according to paragraph 2.34. and AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Two,
  then file maintenance of a direct line backorder to AWP WSSC/SSC/EPSC replenishment is required.
  The end item document number must be used in the identification of ordered material. When the item
  being replaced is an exchangeable, ensure proper DIFM and DOTM file maintenance is done by
  means of paragraph 2.37.
  2.32.4. The donating DMAG RCC performing the cannibalization costs the work (removing the can-
  nibalized item and reinstalling the replacement item) as direct labor to be charged to overhead of the
  benefiting cost center.
     2.32.4.1. The donating RCC that conducted the cannibalization (labor charged to benefiting RCC
     over-head expense) provides the item to depot supply that in turn sells the item to the gaining
     DMAG RCC to use in their repair process. The donating RCC will receive a credit (to the appro-
     priate JON) for the part turned in. Note that some or all of these transactions may be paperwork/
     system transactions (wash-posting) only, not requiring a physical transfer of the canned asset
     between maintenance and supply. The donating production shop will schedule the work using the
     WSSC/SSC/EPSC Workload Manager or WSSC/SSC/EPSC ALS and then advise the WSSC/
     SSC/EPSC to prepare the appropriate documentation, tell the benefiting production shop of the
     scheduled cannibalization to resolve the shortage, and provide the removed items to the WSSC/
     SSC/EPSC for delivery to the benefiting production shop. The gaining DMAG RCC must then
     charge the material cost plus the labor cost to install the canned item sold to them by supply
     against the open JON, just like a normal item bought from supply. These costs will then be
     recouped when the DMAG makes a sale. Note that the donating and gaining RCC can be the same.
     The entire process shall be a joint effort between the WSSC/SSC/EPSC, Fixer, and SCM (prime
     MM/IM), to ensure all cost, production, and demand data is correctly captured in the data systems.
     Special effort will be taken by the WSSC/SSC/EPSC to ensure that all backorder and usage data
     resulting from the cannibalization actions are reflected in the D035K, ABOM/NIMMS, and
     G005M data systems. The option to track and document cannibalization actions can be accom-
     plished at ALC option using applicable screens in G097 associated systems.
  2.32.5. Cannibalization of TCTO Kit Parts. Production personnel will document and notify SCM
  (prime MM/IM) kit managers and SPO/SPDs when Cannibalization of TCTO kit parts is required to
  meet specific end item production schedules.
  2.32.6. Monthly Reporting of Cannibalization Actions to HQ AFMC/A4. Each ALC will collect and
  report on a monthly basis their total number of depot maintenance cannibalization actions for their
  assigned weapon system to HQ AFMC/A4DE for review and compilation. This data shall be seg-
  mented as requested and will be reported utilizing 2 separate attachments: PDM Cannibalization
  Report (Cannibalizations completed to support the Center) and Field Cannibalization Report (Canni-
  balizations completed to support the field). Specifically the data reported to HQ AFMC/A4DE in each
  of these reports will consist of the following:
     2.32.6.1. Date. The month, day and year the action was completed.
     2.32.6.2. Number of PDM Cannibalizations (or Field Cannibalizations): The total quantity per
     action.
48                                                                AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


        2.32.6.3. AFMC Form 206 completed? (Y/N) and AFMC Form 206 Funded? (Y/N). This applies
        to field cannibalization requests. PDM cannibalizations will be charged to the overhead of the
        benefiting RCC.
        2.32.6.4. NSN. The national stock number of the part removed.
        2.32.6.5. Noun (Item Description). The nomenclature of the part removed.
        2.32.6.6. Removal Hours. The total hours required by the mechanic/technician to complete the
        removal of the item(s).
        2.32.6.7. RCC. The lowest organized unit within the depot maintenance at which costs are col-
        lected.
        2.32.6.8. Reason/Comments. Explanation as to why the action occurred along with any other
        applicable information
        2.32.6.9. End Item Designator. Mission Design Series (MDS) for aircraft or missiles, Type Model
        Series (TMS) for engines and other major end items, National Stock Number for commodities.

2.33. Recovering Unbudgeted Workaround Costs Caused by Parts Shortages. The following pol-
icy provides guidance for Depot Maintenance Managers (DMM/IMs) and SCMs to recover costs for spe-
cific situations involving parts shortages.
     2.33.1. Requirements Over and Above Maintenance Requirements Review Board (MRRB) Specifi-
     cations. This case applies whenever the organic depot maintenance activity has to remove/refurbish/
     reinstall materiel items to make a production end item minimally acceptable until a serviceable item is
     available because the item was unavailable from the Air Force SOS. The D035K demand counter,
     NIMMS cost data, and G005M usage history will need to be manually updated to account for the hid-
     den demand. Depot Supply functions should establish standard procedures for the WSSC/SSC/EPSCs
     or ALC/MX to track these instances and manually enter the demand data for the original part into
     D035K and ensure the usage and cost data has transferred to NIMMS and G005M.
     2.33.2. Reuse/Rework/Repair of Parts Authorized by the Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) Pro-
     cess. Frequent cases exist where depot maintenance receives authority to rework, reuse, or refurbish
     parts normally thrown away or condemned when parts shortages prevent timely receipt of new items.
     Authorization is requested using the AFMC Form 202, Nonconforming Technical Assistance Request
     and Reply, and it is the only official means of requesting and furnishing technical data for equipment
     troubleshooting and repair/overhaul procedures beyond existing TOs. Engineering approval is usually
     granted for a certain number of end items sold, or for a limited time (usually 120 days) for any number
     of end items sold. When initiating the AFMC Form 202, for engineering dispositions, the SCM for the
     item in question should be provided a copy. In the event engineering approval is granted to reuse,
     rework, or repair the material item, the SCM must cut an AFMC Form 206 for the time and material
     depot maintenance will be expending. The SCM must fund the action since the reason for the reuse/
     rework/refurbishment action is lack of parts managed by the SCM. Depot maintenance shall not per-
     form the authorized work without SCM funding because it would violate the no free work policy. In
     this case, no requisition is made for the part, or if it was placed on backorder, the backorder is can-
     celled since the demand will be filled through reuse/rework/refurbishment. The D035K demand
     counter, and G005M usage history will need to be manually updated to account for the hidden
     demand. Depot Supply functions should establish standard procedures for the WSSC/SSC/EPSCs to
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                          49


   track these instances and manually enter the demand data for the original part into D035K and ensure
   the usage transferred G005M. By doing this, the D035K will recognize the demands when setting lev-
   els and initiating buys and the G005M will recognize that usage took place when mechanically updat-
   ing material standards. DLA managed items reused/reworked/repaired using the ECP process should
   however, have demand data captured in a similar manner as AF managed items. D035K DHA trans-
   action process shall be utilized, where applicable to ensure DLA is informed of usage. (HQ AFMC/A4
   Memo, DHA Policy/Procedures, 21 May 1999)

2.34. Control of Production Items Awaiting Parts (AWP). When a component part is ordered using
the end item document number, RDD, and the SRD, the backorder(s) will be coded as AWP and linked to
that end item. The priority must be B3 or higher to update the end item database in D035K. When the
decision is made to move the end item from on-work status to formal AWP status, all backorders are redi-
rected to be delivered to the MX store and the end item is moved into AWP storage. Additional proce-
dures for the control and processing of AWP end items and AWP component parts are contained in
AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Two, and AFMCI 21-129, Depot Maintenance Management, Depot Repair
Enhancement Process (DREP).
   2.34.1. All back-orders against an end item are now considered AWP back-orders regardless if the
   end item is in AWP or OWO status. The Fixer/Workload Manager determines if the end item will
   remain OWO. When work must stop due to parts problems the end item, in most cases (if practical),
   will be moved to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC AWP storage area. The Fixer must weigh the level of risk
   they are willing to accept that additional customer requirements will generate.
   2.34.2. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC is responsible for managing Depot AWP. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC
   ensures back-orders are linked to applicable end items and stores end items with appropriate
   piece-parts when the end item is taken off work order. When AWP items become fully supportable
   D035K overwrites AWP with FWP, the Production Material Technician will notify the scheduler. The
   funded end items will always be inducted for work first—this is the responsibility of the scheduler to
   ensure this occurs.
   2.34.3. One of the WSSC/SSC/EPSC primary functions is to prevent and/or resolve AWP conditions
   and make end items fully supportable. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC Chief is accountable to the Fixer for
   AWP conditions and must take every step to resolve the situation. AWP should always be a discussion
   topic at production meetings as outlined in AFMCI 21-129.
   2.34.4. AWP Management. D035K is the accountable system for the management of AWP. ABOM
   is used as the input system for parts ordering. The D035K will link the end item and component piece
   parts under program control (electronically) and will pass AWP updates to NIMMS/ABOM. This
   allows for automatic AWP reporting and management in the D035K and ABOM.
   2.34.5. Production shops must provide the end item document number, Standard Reporting Designa-
   tor (SRD), and Required Delivery Date (RDD) with all requests made through ABOM so that the
   D035K can link the end item and component/piece-parts internally. When ordering parts for end items
   in work, input all initial orders through ABOM using the appropriate priority. Caution must be exer-
   cised in the use of an appropriate base delivery priority to avoid abuse.
   2.34.6. The EXPRESS has been programmed to facilitate the drawdown of AWP assets by first
   selecting end items coded FWP before other carcasses. The D035K will generate an information
   notice to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC notifying them that the last backorder against a given end item has
50                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     arrived (or cancelled) and the asset is ready to return to repair. The list of AWP assets should be rou-
     tinely looked at on a daily basis by all three parties (Fixer, Workload Manager, and SSC) to ensure
     that AWP assets are worked first.
        2.34.6.1. For non-EXPRESS items the scheduler/workload manager will coordinate with the
        Fixer and prime MM to determine if a repair requirement exists and if so, to check D035K for
        AWP end items, and ensure these items are inducted first.
        2.34.6.2. EXPRESS has logic to consider FWP end items as the net repair objective dictates.
        When EXPRESS determines there is a supportable net repair objective, it is automatically posted
        to the D035K Express Table, whereby D035K will check for FWP assets before any other assets.
        If there are any FWP assets, D035K initiates a move notice for the FWP asset(s).
     2.34.7. AWP Policy for Non-Programmed Workloads.
        2.34.7.1. All temporary workloads should be processed using AFMC Form 206. When requisi-
        tioning material, enter the end item document number, Standard Reporting Designator (SRD), and
        Required Delivery Date (RDD) just like a permanent workload. The D035K will then automati-
        cally code piece part requisitions as AWP with advice code 6N. The end items for the non-pro-
        grammed temporary workload will be assigned an AWP - G condition in D035K when a
        backorder exists for component material. Note that this processing and tracking of AWP is totally
        independent of whether or not the end item remains on work order (OWO). When all the compo-
        nent parts have been received or canceled, D035K will automatically change the AWP - G to
        AWP - F (fully supportable). The D035K will output a notification to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC of the
        condition change, parts will be delivered, and work can be completed. Input transactions for AWP
        through ABOM using the AWP Management functionality.
        2.34.7.2. Typically, non-programmed temporary workload is not inducted unless it is support-
        able. Once it is placed OWO it typically stays in that condition until completed. The Job Order
        Quantity (JOQ) can be changed based on changes in customer requirements. The AWP process
        exists, however, for those unplanned occurrences when the JOQ is locked due to customer require-
        ments and a backorder situation exists. The D035K AWP process as supported by ABOM AWP
        Management allows these component backorders to be tracked under the AWP process. The JOQ
        is not reduced in these situations.
        2.34.7.3. The D035K AWP process as supported by ABOM AWP Management should only be
        used for temporary jobs (T-jobs) that are for repair/manufacture. T-jobs for such things as inspec-
        tions, rework, testing, etc., shall be exempt. The AFMC Form 206 should be negotiated with the
        customer to reflect a JOQ that can be produced based on best available data. If, after opening the
        T-job material is found to be unavailable, the maintenance activity may use one of two
        approaches:
            2.34.7.3.1. Contact the customer and negotiate a lower JOQ to match what can be produced.
            If this is acceptable to the customer, reduce the T-job to actual completions, close out the
            AFMC Form 206 and cancel any backorders.
            2.34.7.3.2. If the customer still requires the original JOQ amount, allow the backordered com-
            ponents to remain in AWP status in D035K. If the end item is taken out of OWO, ensure the
            item is tracked in AWP, and that there will not be an out of balance condition between DO35K
            and G004L. The customer should understand that the delivery date of the finished product is
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                             51


         contingent on receiving the required material. If this is not acceptable, the customer will have
         to seek alternate methods of support.
  2.34.8. Disposition of AWP End Items. When repair parts will not be received to immediately sup-
  port an inducted end item, the Fixer must determine the disposition of the end item. The Fixer has
  three basic options.
     2.34.8.1. Leave the end item on OWO if the delivery of piece parts is expected to meet customer
     requirements for end item delivery.
     2.34.8.2. If the current quantity of AWP end items on the D035K records does not exceed the 12
     months expected repair requirement quantity plus the current backorders, and the delivery of piece
     parts will not meet the customer end item delivery requirement, the item will be moved to formal
     AWP. The end item and piece parts should be stored in the AWP store. Induct another end item to
     fill the requirement (excluding T-jobs).
     2.34.8.3. If the current quantity of AWP end items on the D035K record exceeds the 12 month
     expected repair requirement plus current backorders, and the delivery of piece parts will not meet
     the customer end item delivery requirement, no further end items should be inducted and no fur-
     ther end items should be placed in AWP status. An action plan is required to resolve the support
     problems. Cannibalization of other end items is one of the primary options for the missing parts. If
     cannibalization is chosen, follow the policy and procedures in paragraph 2.32. Disposition of the
     canned end item including the determination of the turn-in condition code is the item managers
     responsibility. Disposal is always an option. This policy is required to prevent the stacking up of
     end items in AWP-G and – F-condition status that have no current repair requirement.
  2.34.9. Validation and Management of AWP Backorders. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC will review all
  AWP components for AWP end items and use them to ensure as many end items as possible are fully
  parts supportable. Shop supervisor and WSSC/SSC/EPSC-Chiefs are responsible for reviewing the
  D035K AWP Validation Report and the ABOM AWP Report(s) and related screens, which are part of
  the AWP Management functionality (module). Jointly, they should review entries for components
  on-hand, positive due-in status for each backorder, and cancel invalid backorders. As a minimum,
  these reports must be reviewed weekly. The on-hand components will be moved to the AWP end item
  that can be made fully parts supportable. This may require several components to be moved. Unless
  all backorders can be filled by this process, the end item will not be repaired and the parts will be used
  for an end item that can be made fully supportable.
  2.34.10. Turn-in of Formal AWP End Items not fully supportable.
     2.34.10.1. The Production Support Technician/Material Technician reviews the AWP component
     part list in ABOM to identify parts received, outstanding dues and cancel AWP component part
     list for this end item. The AWP Pick List entries for an end item document number (EIDN) are dis-
     played for review. After engineering review, an Engineering Change Notice (ECN) or Material
     Review Board (MRB) action may be submitted to allow the use of an existing asset.
         2.34.10.1.1. For engineering changes, the material technician reviews the AWP component
         part list for the purpose of issuing parts received and canceling or re-allocating existing back-
         orders. The material technician inputs the new JON for the re-induction issues.
         2.34.10.1.2. For individual part cancellations, the material technician reviews the AWP com-
         ponent parts list and removes the individual part from the list.
52                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


            2.34.10.1.3. For individual part Cannibalization of inducted items, the material technician
            reviews the AWP component parts list and selects the individual part from the list.
            2.34.10.1.4. For AWP component parts list issues, the material technician reviews the list for
            discrepancies before issuing parts.
            2.34.10.1.5. The material technician queries the AWP kit lists by needed National Item Iden-
            tification Number (NIIN). The user then receives a list of end items containing the needed
            NIIN. The user toggles between the main list of available end items to be robbed and the
            detailed AWP kit list by end item. The user enters the new JON and uses the EIDN to identify
            the kit.
        2.34.10.2. ABOM AWP creates ZFA-D transaction. ABOM modifies the Unit Identification
        Code (UIC) from AWP UIC to the support UIC. NIMMS then creates DG_-CC transaction to
        request cancellation in D035K. ABOM transfers parts to DMAG store.
        2.34.10.3. The material technician turns-in material received prior to formal AWP to DMAG
        inventory. When the material technician has completed the AWP actions, the material technician
        notifies the scheduler to execute the D7-RE-PK transactions. The material technician uses the
        ABOM Issue Program to issue parts to the new JON, but use the existing data (i.e. operation num-
        ber, RCC, EIDN, Unique Identifier). Then, ABOM deletes the AWP component part list. After all
        actions have been taken, ABOM flags the AWP component part list for purging.

2.35. Floating Stock /Floating Spares.
     2.35.1. General. NIMMS is the accountable system for management of floating stock inventory.
     Floating stock is ERRC coded “T” items authorized and retained by the Maintenance Wing to support
     maintenance production by acting as replacement components for end items whose sub-assemblies
     have repair times that exceed the repair time of the end item. Availability of floating stock reduces the
     repair flow time for impacted end items. Items are ordered and maintained as DMAG inventory.
     2.35.2. Authorization. The MXG is authorized to maintain floating stocks supporting items removed
     from a higher assembly when the time allowed for routing and repairing the component item will
     exceed the date required for reinstalling the repaired item on the higher assembly. A completed
     AFMC Form 100 (Attachment 14) is required for floating stock authorization. The Planner will
     maintain the AFMC Form 100 (either electronically or hard copy) for as long as the floating stock is
     required.
        2.35.2.1. Floating stock can be requested and justified when an authorized repair capability for
        the floating stock item and next higher assembly exists at the same center.
        2.35.2.2. When a repair capability does not exist, or is not authorized, material will be requested
        from the WSSC/SSC/EPSC stock. Floating stock should be used until adequate retail stock levels
        can be established in the WSSC/SSC/EPSC to support non-job routed repair.
        2.35.2.3. For those ALCs that utilize two level of maintenance, floating stock may be retained for
        job-routed repair to support rapid turn-around times required of a primary or a secondary source of
        repair.
        2.35.2.4. Floating stock is a scheduling tool and not a means to increase productions direct labor
        hour’s capacity. It should be used only to compensate for timing problems, not lack of production
        capacity. For example, if production has the capacity to repair ten ERRC T components and ten
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                            53


     higher assemblies per month, but the components take 30 days to repair and the higher assemblies
     take only 15 days, floating stock is a logical option. However, if production has the capacity to
     repair only five components per month and ten are needed, then floating stock is inappropriate and
     gross production capacity must be increased. The financial impacts of ordering floating stock
     material from the MSD must be considered. Floating stock will be utilized on an absolute mini-
     mum basis.
  2.35.3. Responsibilities. The following responsibilities are provided for floating stock.
     2.35.3.1. The responsible Planner (except as specified below) will:
         2.35.3.1.1. Compute floating stock requirements. Prepare, process, and maintain AFMC Form
         100s. The Planner is responsible for requesting the establishment of floating stock levels as
         required. The Planner will maintain the AFMC Form 100s for each of their respective mainte-
         nance groups.
     2.35.3.2. Validate authorized floating stock requirements on the AFMC Form 100s with the bal-
     ance in the NIMMS floating stock stores (request balance report from your NIMMS functional
     user) annually. Annotate date of validation on the AFMC Form 100. Establishing and updating the
     authorized quantities in NIMMS units per application will be accomplished by the PMT or FLS.
     Responsibility for this function may be assigned to the Production Support Technician as deter-
     mined by each center.
     2.35.3.3. Add, change, and delete floating stock requirements using a new AFMC Form 100 as
     requirements change.
  2.35.4. Responsible WSSC/SSC/EPSC will:
     2.35.4.1. Assist in reviews of authorized floating stock quantities as requested by the Planner.
     2.35.4.2. Inventory. The oversight responsibility lies with the WSSC/SSC/EPSC and/or MXSG
     organizations and physical responsibility lies with the signer of the hand receipt (electronic or
     hard copy). Inventories will be conducted semi-annually at each ALC, and will be lead by MXSG
     personnel. The semi-annual inventory will include maintenance owned floating stock located in
     the repair processes and/or in inventory storage locations.
     2.35.4.3. Floating Stock/Floating Spares Restriction Code. This type storage is identified by each
     center “store” to which Floating Stock/Floating Spare parts will be diverted and stored. The
     NIMMS inventory store includes an “R” restriction code to designate Floating Stock/Floating
     Spares, and to restrict issues from them.
         2.35.4.3.1. To conduct your annual inventories, ALCs are authorized to create COGNOS que-
         ries to extract the on hand floating stock/spares data. Utilizing the existing COGNOS tool, the
         ALCs can tailor and develop any required ad hoc floating stock/spares reports as required.
         Development of standardized floating stock/spares reports to be proposed and utilized across
         all 3 centers must be coordinated through the locally designated ALC DMAPS reports work-
         ing group representatives. Preparation and submittal of DMAPS Problem Tracking System
         (PTS) reports may be utilized for the purpose of proposing new standardized floating stock/
         spares reports.
     2.35.4.4. Issue, request, or turn-in of floating stock/spares:
54                                                                   AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


             2.35.4.4.1. Inventory Storage shall not be used to accumulate floating stock/spares. Turn-in of
             excess floating stock/spares will be given credit based on the item credit indicator (see para-
             graph 2.67.3.). As a result, the cost of increasing or changing the mix of depot floating stock/
             spares will be absorbed by DMAG.
             2.35.4.4.2. Use the ABOM inventory screen in the exchangeable module to request the
             approved item from D035K using cost code “S” and an inventory JON and the NIMMS screen
             MN013P to transfer the floating stock/spares into an inventory store. Floating stock/spares
             items are operated under DIFM/DOTM rules. The floating stock/spares in the NIMMS
             NAVAIR Industrial Fund (NIF) inventory store will be issued when the shop requires one.
             The repairable that is being replaced by that floating stock/spares issue should be turned-in as
             DIFM/DOTM against the JON and the replacement requisitioned to the floating stock/spares
             store.
             2.35.4.4.3. When requesting floating stock, WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel will prepare and
             process the requirement through the ABOM exchangeable requisition screen using Cost Code
             “B” and a Production JON. When requesting floating spares, WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel
             will prepare and process the requirement through the ABOM exchangeable requisition screen
             using Cost Code “B” and a U6630 JON.
             2.35.4.4.4. When issuing floating stock/spares from the NIMMS inventory, the issue is pro-
             cessed using the MN032P screen.
             2.35.4.4.5. When turning in floating stock/spares (e.g. F condition, H condition, no credit),
             WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel will prepare and process the requirement through the ABOM
             exchangeable turn-in screen using Cost Code “B” and a Production JON.
             2.35.4.4.6. To receive credit for floating stock/spares turn-in (e.g. Q condition) WSSC/SSC/
             EPSC personnel will prepare and process the requirement through the NIMMS MN045P
             turn-in screen using Cost Code “B” and a Production JON.
             2.35.4.4.7. When turning in floating stock/spares that no longer has a requirement, it will be
             turned in from the NIMMS store to supply using the MN041P screen.
     2.35.5. Items Unique to Floating Spares. Floating spares support Automatic Test Equipment (ATE),
     initial or final test organizations, fault isolation, shop standard, training, stand-alone, test station, and
     -21 technical order assets. Floating spares also are authorized in support of AFMC engineering flight
     test organizations that must meet required flight test schedules and delivery range times. These items,
     retained to support the MXG, will be termed floating spares within this regulation and on AFMC
     Form 100.
         2.35.5.1. Scope of Items.
             2.35.5.1.1. ATE Support. The MXG is authorized to maintain floating spares of components
             in support of ATE when the delivery time on a like serviceable item would defer the test or
             calibration of an end item. Prime MM notification is required to ensure the visibility of all
             assets in the pipeline through the AFMC Form 100 process. The number of floating spares for
             ATE also will be provided to the prime MM who supports ATE.
             2.35.5.1.2. Flight Test/Final Test Support. Floating spare(s) are authorized in support of items
             rejected in final test pre-flight or flight test when the base issue and delivery time required to
             draw a serviceable item from supply, or time to repair the item, would delay completion of the
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                             55


        end item. Quantities that support the component floating spares will be determined by engi-
        neering planning.
            2.35.5.1.2.1. Final test is defined as final test of aircraft, engines, or other types of final
            test operations where the end item is subject to component replacement to meet production
            schedules.
            2.35.5.1.2.2. Pre-flight or flight test is defined as the processing time between shop com-
            pletion and final delivery acceptance of an aircraft. The same provisions apply to engineer-
            ing test aircraft in order to meet required flight test schedules and weapon delivery range
            times.
            2.35.5.1.2.3. Floating spares in support of final test are not for support of final test equip-
            ment and not intended for depot maintenance locations where an item management
            account for subject NSN is co-located at the same ALC.
        2.35.5.1.3. Fault Isolation. Fault isolation spares are used to detect or isolate a fault or a prob-
        lem in on-line equipment (e.g., aircraft, missiles, or communication systems, etc.). These
        spares are required by the applicable maintenance technical order or service and repair publi-
        cations to complete troubleshooting of a malfunctioning system. An example is the use of a
        printed circuit board to isolate a like circuit board that is inoperative.
        2.35.5.1.4. Shop Standard. Shop standard spares are established as an authorized or recog-
        nized measure used to determine the accuracy of various measurements in other assets. Shop
        standard spares are typically used by avionics maintenance shops when the accuracy of a like
        spare or system must be established and validated (e.g., sealed components such as a gyro, or
        aircraft instrument, etc.). Shop standard spares differ from fault isolation spares in that they are
        used as un-installed auxiliary components of test equipment.
        2.35.5.1.5. Test, Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE). Stand alone spares are
        used in place of TMDE to accomplish calibration, alignment, or repair of an item. The stand
        alone spare can be used as an active spare in support of a particular end item system. An exam-
        ple is a digital controller that is used to calibrate a C-141B aircraft altitude heading reference
        system transmitter and can also used as an active spare to support the C-130H aircraft compass
        system.
        2.35.5.1.6. Test station spares. These are located with, but are not a component part of, the
        basic test set as listed in the applicable Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB) of the technical order
        (TO). An example is tester replacement units used to repair the test station. Test station spares
        do not include bench mock-up assets maintained on accountable supply records.
        2.35.5.1.7. TO-21 assets. These assets are identified in the applicable -21 TO for a particular
        aircraft or missile mission design and series.
        2.35.5.1.8. Any recoverable spares not identified as used by the MXG for the test, repair, or
        evaluation of operational system or support equipment of an item.
     2.35.5.2. Initial Flight Test/Final Test/ATE floating spares authorization. Preparation of the
     AFMC Form 100 for floating spares in support of initial flight test, final test, or ATE will be pre-
     pared by the responsible engineering planning function the same as with all other spares except
     blocks 7 and 8 will be completed (they are left blank in all other situations).
56                                                               AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     2.35.6. Processing AFMC Form 100. Follow the below procedures for preparing AFMC Form 100,
     for floating stock and floating spares. Requirements for ATE/Flight Test/Final Test Requirements are
     in paragraph 2.35.7.
        2.35.6.1. The maintenance groups will determine the quantity of floating stock required to sup-
        port production. The approval authority for all floating stock/spare authorizations for reparable
        XD assets is the requesting activity commander or designated representative. Depot activities
        under the MSD process pay standard price for budget code 8 assets requested for these require-
        ments. The DMAG supply system (NIMMS) floating stock/spare monitor will file maintain these
        details to account for the assets. Part one of AFMC Form 100 will be prepared as follows:
            2.35.6.1.1. (Block 1-6): Enter appropriate office symbols and date. Signature required. If dis-
            approved – reason for disapproval will be placed in Block 12 (remarks) and form will be
            returned to Planner.
            2.35.6.1.2. (Block 7): Enter the functional symbol (six-letter alpha) of the using/assembly
            RCC.
            2.35.6.1.3. (Block 8): Enter the Noun, NSN, and ERRC of preferred item.
            2.35.6.1.4. (Block 9): Enter noun and NSN of immediate next higher assembly.

            stock supports.
            2.35.6.1.6. (Block 11): Make the entries in the floating stock computation (as stated on form)
            section by use of the appropriate formula.
            2.35.6.1.7. (Block 12): Remarks/source data: Enter source document and date of data used for
            computations and additional information or comments, as appropriate.
            2.35.6.1.8. (Block 13): Authorization serial control number (ASCN): Enter production sec-
            tion - RCC - year - Julian date - serial control number (for example, MPJAA-90-365-0012).
            The initiating planner assigns the four-digit suffix code in each ASCN. The suffix is different
            for each floating stock request and once authorized, change requests and annual re-validations
            will contain the same ASCN as the initial request.
NOTE: This is a serial number for the document and does not in any way relate to a physical serial num-
ber, if any, on the actual issued floating stock item.
            2.35.6.1.9. (Block 14): Point of Contact (Info): Enter the name and telephone number of the
            MXG person to contact regarding the requirement.

            appropriate block. Production/Scheduling supervisor coordination (signature required) and
            Engineering approval (signature required) for initial request and upward change on AFMC
            Forms 100. Revalidation/No change and downward change AFMC Forms 100 do not require
            internal coordination if initial request AFMC Form 100 has coordination. Re-accomplished
            floating stock items designated as NO CHANGE--REQUIREMENT VALID will contain the
            original ASCN.
            2.35.6.1.11. (Block 15 – Continued): Quantity Requested. Enter quantity computed by for-
            mula in block 9 rounded up to the next whole number if a fraction exists. Explain in remarks

          explanation will be required in block 10. (NOTE: Coordination for amounts less than
          $50,000.00 can be signed by the designated group, amounts over $50,000.00 require coordina-
          tion by the designated MXW. If MXW signature is required then the MXG commander or
          their designated representative will initial Block 16).
   2.35.7. ATE/Flight Test Final Test (Part II).
       2.35.7.1. Preparation of the AFMC Form 100, Part II for floating spares in support of initial flight
       test/final test/ATE will be prepared as above (Blocks 1 – 8) with the following exceptions:
          2.35.7.1.1. (Blocks 7 and 8)-NOTE. If the spare is not for ATE, leave blank and continue
          with Block 9.
          2.35.7.1.2. (Block 9a): Weapon System Application: Enter the weapon system(s) supported

2.36. Organic Manufacture. Organic is defined as in-house, government (civilian and military person-
nel) work performed by DMAG personnel.
58                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     2.36.1. Use of Other Directives. Additional guidance for organic manufacture can be found in
     AFMAN 23-110, Volume 3 Part Two Chapter 3, AFMCI 21-156, Operational Workloading, Plan-
     ning and Scheduling Control, and AFI 21-102, Depot Maintenance Management.
     2.36.2. General. Organic manufacture is a significant portion of the total MXG workload within each
     ALC, therefore, it must be properly identified, documented, and reported to ensure the DMAG is
     reimbursed for costs accrued in its accomplishment. Major sources for organic manufacture work-
     loads are specific prime MM requirements, including exchangeable and aircraft predictable needs,
     base, area, or line support, and equipment manufacture.
     2.36.3. Procedures for Reporting the completion of organic depot manufacture /fabrication of an item
     from raw materials or components (job designator K) for production assets issued from and returned
     to supply (data processing code (DPC) T). A D6 transaction input to EPS updates D035K, followed by
     an interface with the G004L system. The Workload Manager or WSSC/SSC/EPSC Retail Inventory
     Management Specialist (RIM) checks the order (AFMC Form 206) for disposition of completed
     items. The Workload Manager/RIM will use the most current JON master list in PS/SD/CD/JD
     sequence to verify the data to be used in the D6 turn-in transaction.
        2.36.3.1. The ABOM Local Manufacturing functions are used to track transactions for material
        needed for Local Manufacturing items. These transactions are created against already existing
        Local Manufacturing BOM records received from a daily G004L interface. The process allows for
        BOM transactions encompassing the requisition, receipt and issue of the material once all the req-
        uisitions have been satisfied. The Local Manufacturing Menu Screen is used to track Local Man-
        ufacturing BOM records created from a daily G004L interface. It provides for various functions,
        such as ordering and issuing items. One function of the Local Manufacturing Menu screen allows
        the user to query Local Manufacturing items. The Local Manufacturing Inquiry Response Screen
        lists data for all BOM records fitting the query criteria entered on the Local Manufacturing Inquiry
        Screen. The Local Manufacturing Report Menu Screen gives the user report options as listed
        below.
            2.36.3.1.1. Required NIINs with Insufficient Quantity. Lists information for a specific NIIN
            that has a material quantity on hand less than the quantity due.
            2.36.3.1.2. Dues Without Requirements. Lists outstanding material due records linked to the
            Local Manufacturing Stores in NIMMS which are not in ABOM Local Manufacturing.
        2.36.3.2. Physical Turn-In. Items requiring physical turn-in will be processed as follows:
            2.36.3.2.1. Verify NSN, control number, job designator (K only), and quantity.
            2.36.3.2.2. Prepare transaction, in required copies (action suffix fields will be blank).
            2.36.3.2.3. Attach three copies of the output transaction securely to the items.
            2.36.3.2.4. When the items are picked up by supply, the Workload Manager/RIMS will sus-
            pense one copy of the turn-in transaction in the jacket file. This transaction will not be input to
            any data system. The G004L system will reject all D6 turn-ins with a K job designator
            (DPC-U). G004L will be updated by tape interface after supply inputs. When more than five
            workdays have elapsed since the physical turn-in, the Workload Manager/RIM will contact
            supply for follow-up action.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                         59


        2.36.3.2.5. Upon receipt of the G004L-L2A product for an organic manufactured turn-in, the
        Workload Manager/RIMS will verify all data with emphasis on the CN/JD.
        2.36.3.2.6. When the Workload Manager/RIMS has items returned by central receiving with
        notification of erroneous NSN, quantities, or other data elements on a turn in, prepare four
        copies of a corrected D6 turn-in with a new document number. When items are not returned,
        the Workload Manager/RIM will furnish central receiving with the corrected data on three
        copies of the turn-in transaction and will annotate the suspense copies. Decision for physical
        return of items is the responsibility of the Workload Manager/RIMS.
     2.36.3.3. Wash post Turn-in. Items requiring wash-post turn-in will be processed as follows:
        2.36.3.3.1. Verify NSN, control number, job designator (K only), and quantity.
        2.36.3.3.2. Prepare a D6 turn-in with two copies (action suffix, fields 79-80 will be WP).
        2.36.3.3.3. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC will process the wash-post D7 to add the balance to the
        supply tape. After the balance is recorded, the (Local Manufacturer) L/M WSSC/SSC/EPSC
        will review its issue suspense file to determine outstanding requirements. Process all suspense
        D7 requirements and notify customer that respective material is ready for pick up.
     2.36.3.4. Errors Rejected in G004L-L2A. The single exception to these error codes for organic
     depot manufacture is error code S. Normally, the S code indicates that the stock number on a ser-
     viceable turn-in does not match the NSN on the end item master.
        2.36.3.4.1. On organic depot manufactured items with a P prefix assigned end item identity
        (part number); the D035K system receives manual updates from the base support MMs. These
        manual NSN changes are tabled (along with the mechanized stock list changes from D035K)
        for 180 days and used to automatically update all turn-ins against the old NSNs.
        2.36.3.4.2. The G004L system will accept NSN changes from the D035K system on all
        turn-ins with a K job designator.
        2.36.3.4.3. This automatic NSN change from D035K to G004L depends totally upon the
        Workload Manager/RIM entering the CN/JD in the turn-in transaction to D035K. If an incor-
        rect CN/JD causes G004L to change an end item identity erroneously, then the Workload
        Manager/RIM must input a corrected transaction, with PK action suffix to correct the G004L
        record for each JON with the identity change.
     2.36.3.5. Processing Required Corrections. Submit the following forms or input the necessary
     transactions as required to correct the errors.
        2.36.3.5.1. AFMC Form 930, G004L File Maintenance Transactions, to correct the erroneous
        NSN and the NSN that should have been changed.
        2.36.3.5.2. A D6 reversal transaction to reopen the changed record (if it was closed because
        the OWO became zero).
        2.36.3.5.3. A D6 transaction to correct the production and OWO balance on the erroneous
        CN/JD and the CN/JD that should have been changed.
     2.36.3.6. Special Processing procedures for line support organic depot manufacture. Manufacture
     for supporting the MXG production function will be either an initial requirement or a recurring
     requirement, as explained below. When initiating a request for a part numbered item, the initiator
60                                                               AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


        interrogates the ABOM system through the Local Manufacturing functionality systems to deter-
        mine if the item has been established. The ABOM provides on-line capability. This action will
        determine whether to proceed as an initial requirement or a recurring requirement. If the require-
        ment is one-time only, order only that requirement to satisfy the line requirement and process as
        outlined in paragraph 2.36.3.6.1. If recurring, process as outlined in paragraph 2.36.3.6.2.
            2.36.3.6.1. Initial requirement.
                2.36.3.6.1.1. WSSC/SSC/EPSC. WSSC/SSC/EPSC will initiate a DD Form 1348-6, Sin-
                gle Line Item Requisition System Document, DoD (Manual-Long Form), to supply. The
                MXSG RIM will source code the item, assign a stock number (if required), and load the
                D035 ITEMS record. After the stock number is assigned, a local issue request and a draft
                AFMC Form 206, ill be taken to the L/M SSC/EPSC to establish the backorder.
                2.36.3.6.1.2. L/M SSC/EPSC. The L/M SSC/EPSC will input a replenishment request to
                the ABOM system. This process creates the following:
                   2.36.3.6.1.2.1. Automated AFMC Form 206, which is sent to distribution electroni-
                   cally for action.
                   2.36.3.6.1.2.2. Establish backorder and due-in details.
                   2.36.3.6.1.2.3. Establish AFMC Form 206 in all data systems.
                2.36.3.6.1.3. The applicable L/M WSSC/SSC/EPSC Workload Manager will:
                   2.36.3.6.1.3.1. Complete Part Two of the AFMC Form 206.
                   2.36.3.6.1.3.2. Forward AFMC Form 206 package to manufacturing engineering plan-
                   ning office and furnish copy to originating engineering planning office.
            2.36.3.6.2. Recurring requirement.
                2.36.3.6.2.1. WSSC/SSC/EPSC-IM will initiate special level requirement. Special level
                quantities will not exceed 12-month requirements.
                2.36.3.6.2.2. The L/M WSSC/SSC/EPSC will:
                   2.36.3.6.2.2.1. Establish special levels unless Readiness Base Level (RBL) has been
                   previously established.
                   2.36.3.6.2.2.2. Process WSSC/SSC/EPSC replenishment requests for stock through
                   ABOM and initiate an automated AFMC Form 206. Coordinate with engineering plan-
                   ning function.
                   2.36.3.6.2.2.3. File line support issue requests and upgrade stock backorders for out of
                   stock items.
     2.36.4. Local manufacturing for depot maintenance line support accomplished on an emergency basis
     due to supply parts shortages (both stock and non-stock listed items) shall be approved and funded
     through the prime MM and/or SCM. The AFMC Form 206 process shall be used to accomplish these
     tasks. This is to ensure the depot maintenance manufacturing organization recoups all costs incurred.
     Under no circumstances is depot maintenance to manufacture items and absorb the cost. Engineering
     planning, working with the WSSC/SSC/EPSC, shall track all manufacturing requests (stock listed
     items and non-stock listed items shall be tracked separately) done solely to satisfy an emergency
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                            61


   requirement for depot maintenance line support due to parts shortages. The number of items manufac-
   tured and the cost as shown on the AFMC Form 206 shall be tracked by originating RCC and gaining
   RCC. The occurrence of emergency local manufacture actions for stock listed items with an estab-
   lished level clearly indicates a supply support problem. This data can be used to analyze trends in sup-
   ply support and should be discussed during DREP and AREP meetings with the SCM.

Section 2H—Control of Due-In From Maintenance/Due-Out To Maintenance (DIFM/DOTM) Assets

2.37. Control of Exchange Material.
   2.37.1. General. This section provides the policy for controlling repair cycle assets coded as ERRC C
   or T (XD1 or XD2, respectively), which will be called exchange items or DIFM/DOTM from here on.
   The materiel support division (MSD) manages DIFM/DOTM assets. MSD items are identified by a
   budget code of 8 and a fund code of 64. D035K is the accountable system for DIFM/DOTM.
   2.37.2. Concept. Because the prime MM must be aware of and consider total quantities of all repair
   cycle items when computing reorder quantities, stringent controls have been established to ensure
   absolute accountability and control of DIFM/DOTM items. Overstated DIFM/DOTM quantities
   result in overstating future requirements which can result in overbuying or misallocation of limited
   funding. To identify and control issue and turn-in of these items, computer detail suspense records are
   established in ABOM. Depot maintenance will be charged the Exchange Price on D7 DIFM issue
   transactions for cost codes B and K. DIFM details that remain unsatisfied for an extended period are
   indicative of potential error conditions and supportability problems. Delinquent DIFMs should be
   cleared prior to JON closure.
   2.37.3. Responsibilities.
      2.37.3.1. The WSSC/SSC/EPSCs are responsible for monitoring the DIFM/DOTM program. The
      WSSC/SSC/EPSC team has knowledge and visibility of need and the storage facility has respon-
      sibility for accountability of the DIFM/DOTM assets. The review for retention or deletion of
      DIFM/DOTM computer details must be a joint decision of the WSSC/SSC/EPSC team and the
      applicable MXGs. MXG personnel will keep close coordination with the WSSC/SSC/EPSCs to
      assure total control is maintained.
      2.37.3.2. The PMT/FLS/RIM/SSC/EPSC-IM controls the DIFM/DOTM applicable records for
      the assigned areas. They maintain records through the ABOM exchangeables functionality.
      ABOM automatically assigns the document number to all transactions with an exchange material
      cost code (see Attachment 11).
      2.37.3.3. PMT/FLS/RIM/SSC/EPSC-IM personnel will process all exceptions (e.g., P-blank, FH,
      DD, and F) and some may require the coordination of the WSSC/SSC/EPSC.
          2.37.3.3.1. In the event of an error(s) or if reparable or condemned property cannot be located
          for turn-in after the transaction has processed in ABOM and the turn-in document has gener-
          ated, the turn-in document will be destroyed and the ABOM OPR will be notified immediately
          so the records can be properly corrected. To prevent establishing erroneous DIFM/DOTM
          records, the file copy of all exchange requests and turn-ins must be returned to the PMT/FLS
          as soon as possible after being input into ABOM. The PMT/FLS corrects all erroneous DIFM/
          DOTM records.
62                                                               AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     2.37.4. The DIFM/DOTM PMT/FLS will use ABOM/D035K screens and products to ensure transac-
     tions are properly credited or charged. The proper document in the DIFM and DOTM files will be
     annotated to show the date and action reflected on the register. This will provide the necessary audit
     trail.
     2.37.5. Financial Management will notify the WSSC/SSC/EPSC of any costing errors to be cor-
     rected.
     2.37.6. Policy.
        2.37.6.1. ABOM DIFM/DOTM details must match details in D035K. DIFM/DOTM items must
        be processed in the ABOM exchangeables module. If a DIFM item cannot be found and a dele-
        tion/revision must be made, a Report of Survey, DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation
        & Property Loss, will be done by production. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC function will cancel DIFM/
        DOTM details only when coordinated with the user. A DD Form 200 will be prepared as support-
        ing documentation for deletion of a DIFM detail.
        2.37.6.2. WSSC/SSC/EPSC stock levels for DIFM/DOTM items are established to support a
        15-day requirement.
        2.37.6.3. The ABOM system will not establish a DIFM detail suspense record until the item is
        issued from the WSSC/SSC/EPSC or from the DLA depot supply warehouse. The ABOM system
        maintains a computerized DIFM/DOTM suspense file and completion file (reference ABOM User
        Manual, Section 5)
        2.37.6.4. Items required for initial issue must be requested under the appropriate initial Demand
        Code (see Attachment 6) and Cost Code (see Attachment 10).
     2.37.7. DIFM/DOTM Review Lists.
        2.37.7.1. The ABOM Exchangeable module provides on-screen status and reconciliation capabil-
        ities. This functionality contains all DIFM/DOTM records pertinent to items maintained in current
        status by the WSSC/SSC/EPSCs and MXGs.
        2.37.7.2. The D035K Document Control Register (DCR), A-D035K-BA6-DM-L41 , the Monthly
        DIFM/DOTM Review List A-D035K-BE7-MO-L87 and Daily DIFM/DOTM Review List Part II,
        A-D035K-B72-DA-L87 are available. They reflect each transaction processed in D035K for the
        production maintenance activities. At the end of each month, the previous months transactions are
        consolidated and a monthly document control register is produced.
        2.37.7.3. Credit DIFM validation will be performed monthly as follows:
            2.37.7.3.1. DIFM Credits, where the DIFM age is greater than 18 months, will be deleted
            under program control. If the system does not delete a DIFM Credit over 18 months, a manual
            deletion (ZFX/M) can be processed by the MXSG RIM. Validation with production is not
            required, however care must be taken to ensure DIFM credits required to be matched with
            AWP backorders will be retained. If there is an AWP backorder on file within the same inter-
            changeable and substitute group (I&S) as the credit DIFM detail to be deleted, and there is
            enough quantity on the credit DIFM details to cover all of the AWP backorder, the quantity
            will be retained. The AWP backorder and the credit DIFM may or may not match the date and
            serial number of the document number.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                           63


           2.37.7.3.2. Inquire the D035J ATD screen by stock number and both D7R and DGR DIs to
           determine demand activity within the last year. If there has been demand activity within the
           last 90 days, the credit will be retained. If not, the DIFM credit is a candidate for deletion.
           2.37.7.3.3. Inquire the QR2062 Screen in the EPS - system by control number to determine
           total end items inducted, Job Order Number (JON) status, and if the control number is still
           valid.
           2.37.7.3.4. Validate with scheduler any future requirements for the item.
    2.37.8. Exchange Material Cost Codes. Cost codes for exchange material include all recoverable
    assemblies, installed equipment items, and modification kits from investment appropriations. Cost
    codes have been established for material purchased from the Materiel Support Division (MSD) of the
    SMAG. The cost codes for funded MSD material are listed below, with the existing cost codes cur-
    rently used for unfunded exchange material. (See also Attachment 10 for additional cost codes and
    their definitions; refer to Table A10.1. through Table A10.3. for a complete diagram of material clas-
    sification).

Table 2.2. Cost Codes for Funded MSD Material.
Unfunded Funded             Description
Cost Code Cost Code
E            B              Exchange material
Y             K             Exchange material; maintenance of DMAG equipment, depot
                            maintenance equipment (DME)
M             S             Non-exchange investment material (initial issue)

    2.37.9. Turn-in of exchangeable components from end item disassembly/reclamation, shop floor
    clean-up, or components acquired during condemnation of the end item, will not be turned-in under
    DIFM/DOTM control. These components will be turned-in on the QR2010 screen in the Exchange-
    able Production System (EPS). If the component can be tracked to a valid control number, it should be
    turned-in by the scheduler as a reclaim, using a ‘D6A/L’ DI, an ‘L’ job designator and an ‘H’ cost
    code. If no control number is found, the PMT/FLS will process the turn-in as a found-on base FOB
    using a ‘D6A/X’ DI, a blank job designator, and an ‘M’ cost code.

Section 2I—Processing Issues and Turn-Ins of Due-In From Overhaul (DIOH) Assets

2.38. Production Assets. Accounting for production assets and resolving variances between the D035K
and G004L is covered in AFMCI 21-156, Operational Work-Loading, Planning & Scheduling Control.

2.39. Use of Other Directives.
    2.39.1. AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Two, should be used along with the policies outlined herein for
    complete DIOH and OWO procedures.
    2.39.2. The procedures contained in AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Two, should be used for reject
    transaction processing.

2.40. Issue Receipt Processing.
64                                                                AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     2.40.1. Issue Processing. WSSC/SSC/EPSC (workload manager, or FLS) will check production
     items received in the MXGs for stock number, quantity, and condition code. Paragraph 2.42.
     explains what to do when condition code and stock number differences exist. When production items
     are received and a Receipt Acknowledge (RA) stuffer is not available, the WSSC/SSC/EPSC will pre-
     pare and input the RA transaction using the correct Control Number (CN)/Job Designator (JD), quan-
     tity, and document number from the issue record. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC will retain the RA stuffer
     until receipt of material and the RA transaction is cleared.
     2.40.2. D035K System Processing. Input through ITS/G337 screen QN2025 for end items with chil-
     dren or screen QN2078 for end items with no children.
     2.40.3. G004L System Processing. Valid transactions received from D035K change the OWO quan-
     tity for the CN/JD. The data on the G004L-L2A report should be compared against the RA suspense
     notice. NOTE: Additional edits applied in G004L (i.e., control number, job designator) will cause
     some rejects of transactions that were processed without error in D035K. Correction of G004L OWO
     rejects are processed through EPS, not directly to G004L. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC workload manager
     inputs reversals on DIOH/OWO while non-DIOH/OWO items can be corrected by the WSSC/SSC/
     EPSC RIM using EPS.

2.41. Turn-in Processing.
     2.41.1. From the MXG to depot supply. Workload manager or FLS will notify supply that the produc-
     tion item is available for turn-in to central receiving and obtain a stuffer receipt. The workload man-
     ager will input a turn-in (D6) transaction to EPS, will place the condition tags on items being turned
     in, and attach the ZZ stuffers. D035K will decrease the DIOH balance, increase the in transit-to-sup-
     ply balance, establish a turn-in on the DIOH suspense file and then process an output to the G004L
     system. When the D035K transactions are received in G004L, the OWO is decreased and the produc-
     tion balance is increased. This depends on the job designator and condition code whether it changes
     the production balance. The OWO will decrease but not increase the production balance in some
     cases. Workload manager or FLS will verify quantity and control number or job designator by com-
     paring the suspense transaction against the G004L-L2A report.
     2.41.2. Production items received in central receiving from the WSSC/SSC/EPSC will be receipted
     for by input of a turn-in receipt acknowledgement (RT) to D035K via DSS. From this input, D035K
     will decrease the in transit balance, clear the turn-in suspense, and increase the on-hand balance.

2.42. Erroneous Issues and Misidentified Items. The following procedures apply to those items
received in the MXGs that are either an erroneous issue or a misidentified issue.
     2.42.1. Erroneous Issue. These are items received with a different condition code or stock number
     than that requested before submission of a receipt acknowledgement.
        2.42.1.1. Complete exchange. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC will identify and return all erroneous issue
        items and will deliver a like number of correct items to the MXGs. When the full exchange is
        made, the WSSC/SSC/EPSC will submit the receipt acknowledgment to ITS/G337 or applicable
        aircraft management system (i.e. MPS or PDMSS).
        2.42.1.2. Partial exchange. When a portion of the total issue quantity received is incorrect, the
        erroneous issue will be returned to supply. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC will notify depot supply to pro-
        cess a warehouse denial for all the requested items not received. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC will
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                         65


      change the quantity on the RA transaction to the actual amount received, and clear the transaction
      in ITS.
      2.42.1.3. Retained Material. Any or all-erroneous items received may be retained in the MXGs.
      For the items retained, supply will process a post-post issue for the NSN, quantity and condition
      code and ensure the JON is valid for the item to be worked. Post-post issues bypass establishment
      and clearance of the issue in transit balance and will establish the DIOH in D035K and the OWO
      in G004L. The original RA stuffer must be destroyed and a denial/reversal processed by supply
      for items originally requested.
   2.42.2. Misidentified Issue. These items have been receipted for by input of an RA transaction before
   discovering that the condition code or stock number is different from that requested.
      2.42.2.1. Items returned to supply. Misidentified items, which must be returned to supply, are
      processed by the WSSC/SSC/EPSC as follows:
          2.42.2.1.1. Prepare and attach the proper condition tag showing the correct stock number and
          condition of the item.
          2.42.2.1.2. Input a D6 turn-in transaction to ITS/G337 (or applicable aircraft management
          system, i.e. MPS or PDMSS) screen QN2195 for the correct NSN with a PB action suffix. The
          D035K system will validate the turn-in transaction and return a ZZ action suffix transaction.
          The ZZ transaction updates and creates an in transit balance to supply. The Workload Manager
          or FLS must input a DF1 transaction to update G004L. Follow-up to make sure the D035K
          DIOH record has, in fact, been reduced by the turn-in quantity.
      2.42.2.2. Items retained in the MXGs. Misidentified items to be retained by the MXGs will be
      transferred to the correct control number/JON. This determination is made by the WSSC/SSC/
      EPSC. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC will prepare and input the wash-post (D6/D7) transactions.

2.43. Processing Overages/Shortages. Quantities received that vary from the quantity shown on the
issue document will be processed by the workload manager/FLS in the WSSC/SSC/EPSC as follows:
   2.43.1. Overage Quantity:
      2.43.1.1. Return to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC or depot supply by annotating the original local issue
      document to show the overage quantity received and being returned or; retain in WSSC/SSC/
      EPSC by processing a post-post issue to depot supply for the overage quantity.2.43.1.2. Retain in
      WSSC/SSC/EPSC by processing a post-post issue to depot supply for the overage quantity.
   2.43.2. Shortage Quantity:
      2.43.2.1. Production will contact the WSSC/SSC/EPSC to furnish the shortage quantity. When
      the missing quantity is provided to the MXG, the WSSC/SSC/EPSC will clear the RA transaction
      for the entire amount.
      2.43.2.2. When the shortage quantity is not available, maintenance notifies the WSSC/SSC/EPSC
      to reverse the shortage amount from D035K. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC will change the RA to the
      actual quantity received and clear the RA transaction.

Section 2J—Indirect and Bench Stock Material Control and Support
66                                                                  AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


2.44. General. Material policy by intent and design is to reduce the number of items identified as indirect
and make them direct material issues. Indirect/bench stock material consists of ERRC N or P items.
Bench stocks are items that because of repetitive consumption and relative small cost in relationship to the
end item sales price, warrant being moved to the point of use (POU) in advance of the actual need and
immediately charged to the customer, the six-position Maintenance RCC. Bench stocks will be restricted
to those items classified as indirect material. Indirect material on bench stock will comply with WSSC/
SSC/EPSC requirements to provide maximum material support. The value and composition of inventory
on the shop floor must be controlled to maintain only the right items in the right quantity. By achieving
this objective, production throughput is maintained, the percentage of indirect material cost remains rela-
tively small, and properly sized inventory of low-cost expendable material is maintained in each shop.
The bench stock is constantly being replenished by the IPV contractor/WSSC/SSC/EPSC, up to the
authorized quantity, regardless of current workload, so the supply system is constantly moving the right
material to the shop.
     2.44.1. Material will be classified as direct or indirect according to paragraph 2.5. Policy is to clas-
     sify material as direct where feasible to facilitate the tracking of costs and usage to the end item level.
     2.44.2. The importance of adequate indirect material control cannot be overemphasized. Inadequate
     stockage, shortages, or excesses will place an undue burden on production. To be effective, indirect
     material stocks should be conveniently positioned for the most users and may be mobile or perma-
     nently located. Storage areas for indirect material may include, but are not limited to, special enclosed
     secure areas for pilferable, critical, or other controlled material. These storage areas may be in the
     WSSC/SSC/EPSC or in separate remote areas. Bench stock may be provided in open display bins
     with free access or parts dispensers located directly in the shops (the most common). Bench stock
     items may also be provided to maintenance in kits.
     2.44.3. Bench stocks are composed of an average 30-day quantity of the items each shop has used
     during the past year. Bench stocks are designed so that ten percent (10%) of the total expense material
     cost would accrue from indirect material issued from these inventories. All bulk items (unit of issue
     lbs., feet, hundreds, etc.) are eligible to be placed and maintained as bench stock.
NOTE: For IPV contract bench stock items, the ALC Contracting Officer Representative (COR) is
authorized to approve deviations (exceed or decrease) from the 30 day level requirement on a
case-by-case basis to facilitate IPV contract execution. The IPV contractor is authorized to both increase
and decrease depot bench stock bin AQ levels only with the local COR approval.
     2.44.4. If the storage of other than bench stock material is occurring in the MXGs, strict controls will
     be established to ensure these assets are not co-mingled. Bench stock shall not be co-mingled with
     WIP, or shop residue as an example.
     2.44.5. Only serviceable material will be maintained or stored in indirect material locations or bench
     stock bins.

2.45. All bench stock items will be managed under the DLAs IPV program/contract. Deviations or
exceptions from this policy must be approved by AFMC/A4DE. For bench stock items approved to be
managed outside of IPV, use ABOM for material management. All non-IPV bench stock locations and
authorized levels will be maintained in ABOM. No bench stock will be maintained outside either this con-
trol or IPV. Applicable data products can be requested from ABOM as part of this control.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                             67


   2.45.1. Material will be located by bin in a designated location. Bench stock bins will be labeled to
   identify NSN, part number, unit of issue, authorized bin quantity, and shelf life (if applicable). This
   labeling requirement is not applicable to shop stock. Inclusion of the noun on depot bench stock bin
   labels is an optional requirement.
NOTE: The intent of the labeling requirement is for labeling to be standard across all ALCs. The policy
applies to both organic and contract managed DMAG stock. Data elements do not have to be exact
matches if the data elements meet the intent. This is especially important for contractor managed bench
stock where contractor nomenclature may not exactly match government nomenclature. If the information
is there and the intent is met, exact matches are not required. The government should make every effort,
however, to ensure contractor-managed bench stock labeling matches as closely as possible to the require-
ments of this paragraph. Contracts should be written with these minimal requirements.
   2.45.2. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC must provide a bin label for those items that are not under IPV con-
   tract support. See Section 2J for details on indirect material/bench stock management. Following the
   review, the date of last review must be updated on each bin using whatever method the WSSC/SSC/
   EPSC chooses. If a review was conducted on an entire storage location such as a cabinet, only one
   posting is required (not required to have duplicate postings on each individual bin). Reviews of bench
   stock shall occur every 90-days/1 quarter to check ABOM established levels, proper bin labeling, and
   proper storage of material if it's still under Air Force organic management oversight control. Sched-
   uled reviews of bench stock items managed by IPV contractors will be accomplished in accordance
   with IPV specific contract provisions and procedures.
   2.45.3. Only serviceable material will be stored.
   2.45.4. Items removed from bench stock and not used in the production process will be returned to
   the proper bench stock, and if possible, by the person who removed material originally. MXGs will
   establish local procedures to control the material that is withdrawn and returned from/to the bench
   stocks. NOTE: This will be accomplished if under AF item support.
   2.45.5. The only proper method for disposing of bench stocks is by using the following procedures
   authorized for turn-in of consumables (ERRC N and P).
       2.45.5.1. Material residue, which can be identified to a stock number or part number, will be peri-
       odically turned over to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC.
       2.45.5.2. Material residue from kits, work orders, or expense material that can not be identified to
       a stock number or part number and is not needed, will be turned over to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC or
       the Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO) if applicable, using consumable (ERRC N or
       P) turn-in procedures. NIMMS store is not to be used. Shop floors are not to be used for collecting
       material residue.
   2.45.6. Refer to the material classification table (Figure A12.1.) for additional material relationships.
   Refer to Attachment 10 for additional cost codes and definitions.

2.46. Bench Stock Responsibilities. Bench Stock responsibilities are defined in AFMAN 23-110, Vol.
3, Part II.

2.47. Establishment of Bench Stock Material.
68                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     2.47.1. Bench stock may be placed in bench stock bins at operating stations in the work areas served.
     Replenishment will be performed by the WSSC/SSC/EPSC unless managed under the IPV contract.
     Each bench stock area will be identified by a separate and distinct six-position resource and function
     code (example: MEPFRA) by production personnel. Lists of the items in the bins of each operating
     station area must be prepared and attached to these storage bins.
     2.47.2. For approved non-IPV bench stock items, each individual bin, whether it is located in a
     secured area (WSSC/SSC/EPSC as example) or on the shop floor in an open bin will be labeled to
     identify the NSN, unit of issue, authorized quantity (AQ), shelf life (if applicable) and part number.
     Inclusion of the noun on depot bench stock labels is optional. A bench stock detail will be established
     in ABOM reflecting authorized material. Contractor managed bench stock can be managed with data
     systems other than ABOM; however, the data system must minimally provide the same information as
     ABOM. The ABOM authorized bench stock and levels will be reviewed at least every 90 days/1 quar-
     ter by the WSSC/SSC/EPSC for accuracy (Note: for contractor managed bench stock the contractor is
     responsible for all duties listed here as WSSC/SSC/EPSC duties). Bin levels will be checked at least
     weekly (daily if required) by the WSSC/SSC/EPSC and replenished where necessary. Labels will be
     updated, if necessary after each 90-day review.
     2.47.3. Bench stocks will be restricted to those items classified as indirect material.

2.48. Bench Stock Material.
     2.48.1. ERRC N or P items may be placed in a MXG in advance of actual need. Bench stock material
     is owned by the MXG. Repetitive consumption patterns may be used for determining material require-
     ments. The using activity will be solely responsible for ensuring the retained or requested items and
     quantities are the minimum essential items required to support the mission and future production.
     2.48.2. For approved non-IPV bench stock, items may be added to or deleted from bench stock upon
     coordination with the Planner, the production shops, and the WSSC/SSC/EPSC. This is accomplished
     by making changes to the bench stock in ABOM.
     2.48.3. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC, engineering planning, and production shops should maintain respon-
     sibility for all bench stock adds or deletes, not just for Non-IPV bench stock. While the IPV contractor
     is responsible for maintaining, filling, and making AQ adjustments over the life of the item with ALC
     Contracting Officer Representative (COR) approval, the decision to add or remove a specific NSN
     should still require the same level of approval.

2.49. Bench Stock Operation.
     2.49.1. Authorized quantity. The authorized quantity for each item in the bench stock system initially
     is input when the item is established by the planner. This quantity will be derived from known require-
     ments or based on past experience.
     2.49.2. Exceptions. Projects and temporary job orders will not be established as bench stock unless
     there is sufficient history to temporarily establish a bench stock until the project or temporary job is
     completed.
     2.49.3. ABOM System Leveling Qualifications. The authorized quantity will be leveled on a quar-
     terly update. The requirement to maintain levels in ABOM applies only to bench stock that is owned
     and managed by the MXG. Control of bench stock that is being managed by a private contactor (IPV)
     will be covered under the governing contract agreement. Any findings during any inspections should
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                              69


   be addressed with local IPV program management focal points as well as HQ AFMC/A4DE and
   DLA.
   2.49.4. Location of Bench Stock Material.
       2.49.4.1. Material will be assigned a location. If it is necessary to relocate an item, operating and
       indirect material/bench stock area locations must be changed. In addition, a reserve location may
       be established for high volume items and this location noted on the master bin tag in the indirect
       material/bench stock storage area. For IPV sub-located material (reserve material that cannot fit
       into the prime location), the contractor is authorized to store sub-located material in the applicable
       vidmars or other designated locations provided by maintenance. The sub-located (reserve loca-
       tion) material will be marked with the prime bench stock location and other related information in
       accordance with 1.43.1.
       2.49.4.2. Bench stock will be binned in the work or operating area or POU. At this point, the
       depot maintenance production shop (RCC) is charged.
       2.49.4.3. Pilferable material will be maintained in the WSSC/SSC/EPSC.
       2.49.4.4. Substitute items will be placed in bins reflecting the substitute item stock number and
       stored if possible in the same general location as the preferred item stock number. The exact loca-
       tion of the preferred item stock number will be annotated on the applicable local form and placed
       with the substitute item.
   2.49.5. Special Level Stock Category. There will be no special levels in bench stock. Material will be
   placed in the WSSC/SSC/EPSC and controlled as direct if special levels are required.
   2.49.6. Backorder and Material Not In Stock At Operational Area.
       2.49.6.1. The material status will be available to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel from the
       ABOM and NIMMS systems.
       2.49.6.2. Notification of bench stock shortages will be placed to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC for imme-
       diate distribution of material when received.
   2.49.7. Each time a bench stock change is made the bin should be reviewed for proper labeling,
   authorized material, and level by the WSSC/SSC/EPSC. At a minimum, this review should take place
   at least quarterly unless being managed under the IPV contract. Documentation and verification of
   quarterly reviews may be maintained electronically.

2.50. Storage. All material in storage will be protected as required according to AFI 23-111, Manage-
ment of Government Property in Possession of the Air Force.
   2.50.1. Tagging material for storage.
       2.50.1.1. If the identity or condition of the bench stock material is obvious, tagging is not
       required; however, if the identity or condition is not obvious, one tag is acceptable for the quantity
       contained in a bag, box, bin, etc.
       2.50.1.2. Raw stock materials do not require condition tags, but must be identified as required in
       TO 42D-1-3 or have a legible mill marking. When raw stocks cannot be identified or are suspected
       of being erroneously identified, the WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel will ask the office qualified to
70                                                                AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


        analyze them. Once material is properly identified, it will either be tagged and stored or disposed
        of as appropriate.
     2.50.2. Shelf life item control.
        2.50.2.1. WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel will ensure age control and cure-dated material is stored,
        updated, and purged according to AFMAN 23-110, Volume 7, Part Three. They will segregate the
        items and mark bins conspicuously with a standard bin label identifying shelf life item stock num-
        ber, manufacturer's part number, or military specification, and shelf life code for the item stored
        therein. Age-dated material must have the age control date, either the manufacture or expiration
        date, indicated on each container at all times.
        2.50.2.2. Controlling of bench stock in the production area is a joint effort between the WSSC/
        SSC/EPSC and production since the access to the material requires intrusion into maintenance
        shops. The SSC/EPSC, PMT, and WSSC/SSC/EPSC supply technician, however, is the official
        monitor. If indirect material items become over-aged or if the expiration date cannot be deter-
        mined, items must be lab-tested by the SOS or sent to DRMO. Other than A condition, material
        can not be received in the WSSC/SSC/EPSC, the system will reject turn-in.
        2.50.2.3. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC will physically check on a routine basis (weekly, monthly, etc.)
        to make sure shelf life material is current, properly marked, and stored correctly.
        2.50.2.4. Outdated material will be removed from available stock and handled according to para-
        graph 2.14. of this instruction.
        2.50.2.5. WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel will screen all Type II items in FSC 8010, 8030, and 8040
        to determine if testing is required to update/extend prior to their expiration date. DLA is responsi-
        ble for testing depot stocks. Maintenance personnel must contact DLA for test results before dis-
        posing of expired shelf-life items. Testing may be performed at AFMC test labs or commercial
        laboratories. Refer to AFMAN 23-110, Vol. VII, Part Three, for further guidance. Additional
        questions should be directed to HQ AFMC/A4RP.
     2.50.3. Material in short supply and sensitive item control. Controlling sensitive items or material in
     short supply is the responsibility of the WSSC/SSC/EPSC. Those items may be stored in bench stock
     areas, but will be maintained in an enclosed secured area.
     2.50.4. Hazardous Material Control.
        2.50.4.1. When material is issued to the production shops for use, this responsibility is transferred
        to the appropriate production chief. Hazardous material is controlled according to Air Force Occu-
        pational Safety and Health 91-series standards. Local controls put in place by local environmental
        management organizations may also have to be considered in the management of hazardous mate-
        rial.
        2.50.4.2. Hazardous material will not be stored in bench stock areas.
        2.50.4.3. Utilize D002A (SBSS) procedures contained in AFMAN 23-110, Vol. II, Part Two.

2.51. Turn-in and Excess Material. If material on hand exceeds the computed requirements, it will be
turned in to the appropriate WSSC/SSC/EPSC for disposition. Only serviceable material in the stock
listed unit of issue will be returned to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC for credit/noncredit and will be condi-
tion-tagged unless material is still in the original manufacturer's package. Material with less-than-unit of
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                             71


issue can be turned in to the bench stock or, if no bench stock detail exists, the WSSC/SSC/EPSC will
assist with turn-in process.

2.52. Individual Possession of Bench Stock Material. The following policy is provided for control of
indirect material (bench stock) possessed by the individual mechanic, within the MXG, excluding Plant
Management Division personnel. NOTE: Policy in AFMCI 21-122, Foreign Object Damage Prevention
Program applies for control of indirect material possessed by a mechanic. This reference is intended for
strict FOD prevention and pertains to the indirect material in the possession of the mechanic at the job
site.
   2.52.1. Mechanics/Technicians are authorized to maintain at their station a quantity of indirect bench
   stock material that is required daily in the performance of their duty assignment. Cotter pins, nuts,
   bolts, etc., are typical of the type of items they may possess.
       2.52.1.1. The maximum quantity allowed per person will depend on the type of work assignment
       and the supervisor's discretion. For items such as pins, nuts, bolts, etc., the quantity allowed will
       not exceed, in the opinion of the supervisor, a 1 to 2 day supply. All bench stock containers
       retained at workstation will be labeled with part number or NSN. Excess material will be returned
       to the bench stock bins, or follow the procedures in paragraph 2.49.
       2.52.1.2. These guidelines are within the framework established by using the LEAN tool of 6S
       (sort, straighten, scrub, safety, standardize and sustain) which targets having only the right amount
       of material when needed at POU.

Section 2K—Aircraft/Engine Asset Control and Cost Codes S and M

2.53. Aircraft/Engine Asset Control. Exchangeable components removed from aircraft and engines are
repaired (overhauled) as production items. When aircraft and engine components are removed from air-
craft or engine programs and processed through the MISTR (Exchangeables) schedule, the following
transactions will be accomplished.
   2.53.1. Aircraft Components. A wash post transaction with matching document numbers and quanti-
   ties is input to NIMMS to turn-in and issue material.
   2.53.2. Engine Components. (ERRC C and D exchangeables). When the asset is serviceable as-is a
   maintenance production transaction with card code R will be prepared and input to G004L. At the
   same time, another maintenance production transaction with card code S will be prepared for the same
   item and entered into G004L. The complete maintenance production transaction cycle will be accom-
   plished as if the item were reparable.
       2.53.2.1. Reparable Assets. When the item is reparable, a maintenance production transaction
       with card code R will be prepared to show receipt and another maintenance production transaction
       with card code S will be prepared to reflect serviceable production when work has been accom-
       plished. These component items will not be accounted for as routed work, but will be processed as
       exchangeable items.
       2.53.2.2. Job Routed Repair of Engine Components (OC-ALC only). Engine components which
       are designated Job Routed Repair require a written request be submitted to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC
       chief for approval/disapproval before any serviceable assets can be bought to replace a job routed
       item.
72                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     2.53.3. Routed Repair Replacement Quality (RRRQ). Policy for the use of RRRQ assets is contained
     in AFMCM 23-1, Requirements for Secondary Items (D200A, D200N). Air Force policy directs the
     use of RRRQ assets when these items are in a serviceable long supply position. Present policy allows
     these assets to be bought at a reduced price that equals the repair price rather than the exchange price
     for these assets. When the serviceable long supply is expended, the unit repair cost and or forecasted
     unit price in the interim pricing system will be returned to the original value or current actual values.

2.54. Investment Material Cost Codes S, U, and M.
     2.54.1. General. DMAG policy requires the Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG) be paid for
     all work performed. Replacement of missing items discovered during repair of aircraft, engines, and
     other assets must be funded by the customer before the work can be completed. Investment material
     Cost Codes S, U, and M will be used primarily for issues of serviceable exchange material without a
     corresponding turn-in of a reparable item. The issue transaction will use Demand Code A to ensure
     exclusion from DIFM/DOTM control. The policy for the replacement of missing items found in the
     repair of assets is found in AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 1, Part Three.
     2.54.2. Justification for Using Cost Codes S and M.
        2.54.2.1. The appropriate MXG chief will approve all cost code S and M issues.
        2.54.2.2. Approval will be by letter or dated signature on the reverse of the material request form
        and kept on file for six months to provide for an audit trail.
     2.54.3. Cost Code M. Cost Code M is used to order investment material, which is unplanned and
     funded but for which no reparable turn-in will be made. The only appropriate use of Cost Code M is
     to requisition a replacement for missing items. It is typically used for ordering replacements of miss-
     ing depot level reparables (DLRs) on major end items discovered during organic repair of aircraft,
     engines, and other assets.
        2.54.3.1. The procedure for the replacement of missing Materiel Support Division (MSD) assets
        found during the repair of aircraft, engines, and other assets is described below.
            2.54.3.1.1. When major end items with missing assets are received by the depot for repair,
            additional funding or the missing component itself must be obtained from the customer for
            work that is discovered during the repair process but not originally negotiated. If the customer
            decides to fund for the missing component the funds will be obligated and depot maintenance
            will requisition the missing item and pay standard price. Depot maintenance will record this
            transaction as a missing item (Cost Code M) for financial purposes. Even though there will be
            a charge to DMAG, the net effect is that O&M (or other) customer will reimburse the DMAG
            for the missing component.
            2.54.3.1.2. If the request for funds and the missing asset are denied, the problem should be
            elevated within the ALC management structure as necessary for resolution. If resolution can-
            not be made with the customer, then depot maintenance will not requisition the missing item
            but instead will return the major end item to the customer, after overhaul, without the missing
            item.
        2.54.3.2. Replacement of a missing DLR will be considered a change in the scope of work. The
        depot maintenance customer will be prepared to replace a missing item discovered during the
        depot repair process. This can be done by providing funding to the DMAG for the replacement of
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                              73


     all missing DLRs, or by shipping all missing items to the depot for installation on the major end
     item. In order to maintain the long-term solvency of the DMAG the No Free Work Policy must be
     strictly enforced.
     2.54.3.3. Depending on the cost of the missing items involved, management should be flexible to
     make a decision in the best interest of the depot and the solvency of the DMAG. There may be
     cases where management determines that the cost of missing items does not warrant renegotiation
     of the price of the work. Management should ensure documentation exists to justify the decision
     as stated in paragraph 2.54.2.
  2.54.4. Cost Code S. Cost Code S is used for the issue of investment material which is planned and
  funded and for which no reparable turn-in will be made. This would be the situation of an initial instal-
  lation or for the ordering of a modification item other than a modification kit.
     2.54.4.1. Cost Code S Additional Criteria. When the situation exists of depot maintenance-gener-
     ated items returned to supply requiring 100% replacement, the replaced items should be
     exchanged using regular DIFM/DOTM procedures. This will allow the DMAG to be charged only
     the exchange price of the new replacement item. If DIFM/DOTM procedures cannot be used, the
     replacement asset will be ordered using a Cost Code S.
         2.54.4.1.1. If credit is available for the replaced asset, it should be returned to supply using
         Cost Code S.
         2.54.4.1.2. If credit is not available for the replaced asset, it should be returned to supply using
         a D6A transaction with an X in position 7 and using Cost Code M.
     2.54.4.2. Caution. It is important to understand that if an MSD asset is returned by the depot
     maintenance function to the supply account using Cost Code S, then this asset may or may not be
     excess to the needs of the stock fund. Credit will be given based on the item credit indicator. If an
     MSD asset is returned to supply as Cost Code S, then automatic credit will be given in depot main-
     tenance systems. However, the D035J system (Financial Accounting and Billing System
     (FIABS)) may not actually give credit due to a no-credit indicator. Any no-credits are distributed
     to all depot maintenance organizations in overhead costs, which ultimately results in inaccurate
     direct JON expenses and increased overall expenses. This situation should be avoided.
  2.54.5. Appropriate Use of Cost Code M. Depot maintenance-generated assets returned to supply as
  the result of reclamation actions, kit residue, FOB assets, save lists, and mod kit replacements are not
  subject to credit by the MSD and should be returned to supply using a D6A transaction with an X in
  position 7 and Cost Code M (the transaction for found on base turn-ins). Consequently, these assets
  will be picked up as inventory adjustments in the D035K accountable system in depot supply. The
  impact is that the DMAG will be paid for performing the service of repairing the end item, aircraft,
  etc., but not for the assets removed and returned to the depot supply inventory.
     2.54.5.1. Cost Code M is also used to order investment material, which is unplanned and
     unfunded for which no repairable turn-in will be made. The appropriate use of Cost Code M is to
     requisition a replacement for missing items after obtaining permission from the prime MM. It is
     typically used for ordering replacements of missing recoverable components during repair of a
     higher assembly DLR received in an incomplete condition. Policy for the replacement of missing
     item found in the repair of exchangeable items is found in AFMAN 23-110, Vol. I, Part Three.

            2.54.5.1.1. When DLRs (Recoverable NSNs, ERRC T) with recoverable components missing
            are received by the depot for repair, permission from the prime MM must be obtained to order
            the missing component without incurring a standard price change for work discovered during
            the repair process but not originally negotiated. If the prime MM decides to grant issue of the
            missing item, depot maintenance will requisition the missing item outside of the DIFM/
            DOTM detail and not incur the standard price charge.
            2.54.5.1.2. If the request for issue of the missing asset is denied, the problem should be ele-
            vated within the ALC management structure as necessary for resolution. If resolution cannot
            be made with the prime MM, then depot maintenance will not requisition the missing item, but
            instead request disposition instructions for the asset from the prime MM.
     2.54.6. Reference Attachment 10 for additional cost codes and their definitions.

Section 2L—Standard Base Supply System (SBSS) (D002A)

2.55. General. The MXGs may have to order selected material through the D002A, SBSS system. This
includes items stocked in the Base Service Store, individual clothing, equipment, office supplies, tools,
lumber, packing material, and gas cylinders. SBSS regulatory and procedural guidance is contained in
AFMAN 23-110, Volume II, Part Two.

2.56. Federal Stock Classes (FSCs). The following FSCs in Table 2.1. may be input to either the
D035K or the SBSS systems, at local management discretion. The CoS may elect to locally manage other
specific items or FSCs through SBSS.

2.58. SBSS Liaison Support. The Chief of Supply or designated representative will designate/appoint in
writing an SBSS liaison to resolve user problems.
     2.58.1. The MXGs will identify user-training requirements to the depot supply SBSS liaison. The
     SBSS liaison will ensure required training is made available by utilizing local base resources first, and
     outside resources second.
     2.58.2. The MXGs will identify SBSS products and reports required for each RCC by account num-
     ber to the SBSS liaison. The liaison will ensure required reports are delivered to the requesting RCCs.
     Reports of primary interest include the following:
        2.58.2.1. D11—Daily PFMR/OCCR Update and Reconciliation Report.
        2.58.2.2. D18—Priority Monitor Report.
        2.58.2.3. M30—Due Out Validation Listing.
        2.58.2.4. R31—Due Out Status Listing.
     2.58.3. SBSS provides a daily file to an ABOM sub-module: Automated Transition Standard Base
     Supply System (ATS). The ATS module provides an automatic method to process any SBSS type of
     material requisition request, status, receipts, and catalog update transaction to NIMMS/DIFMS. A
     daily file is provided from D002A (SBSS) and process daily to ATS.

Section 2M—Work-In-Process (WIP) Inventory (Commodities/Engines)

2.59. General. WIP is defined as any repair job that has been started but is incomplete. This includes any
item that has been inducted regardless of where it is in the repair process. Once the last operation is com-
pleted, the WIP is considered serviceable and can be sold. WIP inventory is any end item, sub-assembly,
or material that is being held and stored until it can be processed further. It is necessary to identify any
material generated from a job order/production control number that is not required to meet the repair
requirements. This WIP inventory is considered excess. Once identified, the excess is to be turned in to
the SSC/EPSC for disposition, or if it is in reparable condition, the MAs must contact the MM for dispo-
sition, i.e., condemn, repair, or turn-in. NIMMS store is not to be used as a storage area for excess material
that will not be required for future repairs. The only way to minimize WIP inventory is by enforcing cor-
rect ordering procedures and shop floor discipline. It must be understood that any inventory that is main-
tained by maintenance is a cost to DMAG and as such is increasing sales prices. The only way of
76                                                               AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


recouping costs for material that was bought in excess is to charge that material to another JON. This
requires the item to be turned in to the NIMMS store (Y-Store), where it becomes a DMAG asset, and
then re-issued to another JON. If the item is true excess that will not be used for a future repair and is
never reissued to another JON, DMAG will incur that excess inventory cost as overhead regardless if that
material is stored in the NIMMS store or turned into supply for no credit.

2.60. Policy. Each MXG shall establish a program that provides for control and tracking of all generated
WIP inventory from repair orders and a manual or mechanized audit trail of all documents. The center
MXW is responsible for ensuring the MXG has a program in place. First line production supervisor or
other designated supervisors shall be designated as having primary responsibility for the process at each
center.
     2.60.1. Inventory. Inventory accuracy of WIP inventory must be maintained for controlling costs and
     ensuring possible bottlenecks/constraints are removed from the production process. NOTE: In lieu of
     these inventory requirements, MXW can submit a local instruction for controlling WIP to HQ AFMC/
     A4D for approval.
        2.60.1.1. Each bin location within a mechanized material handling system (MMHS) unit, or
        stacker, must be inventoried at least once a year by the MXWs. Each bin location must be labeled
        indicating the items being stored, NSN, and serviceable/unserviceable condition.
        2.60.1.2. Random sampling techniques, wall-to-wall methods, or ABC cycle counting or classifi-
        cation may be used to satisfy the requirement.
        2.60.1.3. Any item that is not consumed in the repair process for which it was purchased will be
        immediately turned into supply unless the item meets the requirements outlined in this instruction
        paragraph 2.66. It may then be maintained in a NIMMS inventory store.
        2.60.1.4. The only material that should be maintained on the shop floor is direct material staged
        for immediate consumption, material in the Awaiting Maintenance Storage Area or properly
        stored bench stock. Coordinating material requirements with SSC/EPSC personnel and maximiz-
        ing the use of forward storage areas can greatly reduce the amount of WIP inventory required to
        be maintained by maintenance personnel.

2.61. Responsibility. It is the responsibility of the production supervisor or other designated supervisor
to keep an accurate account of WIP inventory using automated or manual tracking methods. Maintenance
production supervisors must identify the causes of the WIP or generated yield and control it from the
source. Material generated because of maintenance processes that are excess to requirements is a clear
indication that something is wrong in the production process. Excess WIP inventory or yield must be reg-
ularly evaluated and considered for turn-in to the SSC/EPSC. Special attention must be given to auto-
mated storage locations known as stackers, or MMHS located in the depot maintenance shop areas used
for storage of WIP inventory. These locations are known to accumulate unrecorded or unwanted assets.
All WIP material shall be accounted for and minimized. Depot maintenance should not be producing
assets where no requirement exists. NOTE: In lieu of these inventory requirements, MXW may submit a
local instruction for controlling WIP to HQ AFMC/A4D for approval.
     2.61.1. Ensure all material is accounted for from the point of ordering to final consumption. Any item
     that is not consumed in the repair process for which it was purchased will be immediately turned into
     supply or placed in a NIMMS store.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                             77


       2.61.1.1. Maintain an inventory record indicating location and identification of assets by NSN
       and condition (serviceable/unserviceable).
       2.61.1.2. Ensure all inventory locations are properly labeled for identification.
       2.61.1.3. Ensure items that are turned into NIMMS inventory stores are legitimate items that are
       maintained on an active BOM.
       2.61.1.4. Make sure each MMHS or automated storage location is inventoried twice a year.
       2.61.1.5. Maintain inventory result records for inspections and audits and retain for one year.
       2.61.1.6. Evaluate and determine disposition of excess WIP material or, if applicable, contact
       MM for appropriate disposition.

Section 2N—WSSC, SSC/EPSCs, and NIMMS Store

2.62. Policy. Additional policy is included in AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Two, AFMCI 21-129, and
AFMCI 21-133.

2.63. General. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC is the standard materiel and production support function for depot
maintenance in AFMC. The SSC/EPSC primarily supports exchangeable and engine shops while the
WSSC/EPSC primarily supports aircraft shops. SSC/EPSCs and WSSC/SSC/EPSCs are organized and
staffed differently but both have the same prime function is to provide the right materials and production
support to the Fixer. The WSSC/SSC/EPSCs are designed to provide forward stockage of those assets
required for anticipated or forecasted production workloads. Stock levels are established in D035K for
items managed by SMAG. DMAG-managed items are stored under NIMMS. These levels can be aug-
mented with special levels if approved by the prime MM in coordination with the Depot Chief of Supply
and stock fund manager. In addition to forward stockage, the WSSC/SSC/EPSC also serves as a liaison
organization between the DLA warehouse and depot maintenance. WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel are
tasked with acquiring, storing and issuing of material. They are also responsible for accurate record keep-
ing and assisting in the resolution of parts problems impacting depot maintenance production.

2.64. Functions. Not intended to be all-inclusive. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC provides the following support.
   2.64.1. Order materiel; provide status/follow up on selected items.
   2.64.2. Receive/store/distribute items/materiel within Fixer's area.
   2.64.3. Maintain accurate computer records for serviceable materiel stored in WSSC/SSC/EPSCs and
   in NIMMS store locations.
   2.64.4. Manage AWP.
   2.64.5. Set levels and manage bench stock.
   2.64.6. Perform retail item management and stock control.
   2.64.7. Control DIFM/DOTM.
   2.64.8. OWO/DIOH.
   2.64.9. Manage Floating Stock.
   2.64.10. Maintain BOM and Lists of Material (LOM).
78                                                                AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     2.64.11. Perform supportability analysis.
     2.64.12. Schedule work through the shops.
     2.64.13. Manage local purchase emergency buys to include CAP.
     2.64.14. Perform material planning.
     2.64.15. Maintain HAZMAT issue point.
     2.64.16. Develop parts availability strategy.
     2.64.17. Measure shop performance.
     2.64.18. Perform signature receipting on behalf of the MXG.
     2.64.19. Ensures that personnel are properly trained to use the data systems (G005M, ABOM,
     NIMMS, D230, and D043). Ensure that key personnel are trained in the workaround processes and
     how to conduct transactions. Periodic verification should be conducted in the WSSC/SSC/EPSCs to
     trace the transactions through the data systems to ensure the G005M is being updated. In cases where
     the workaround process is not followed, corrective action should be taken to ensure that the DIFMS
     costs and G005M replacement factor is manually updated.

2.65. WSSC/SSC/EPSC Structure.
     2.65.1. WSSC/SSC/EPSCs are identified in D035K by a three-position alpha/numeric Routing Iden-
     tifier (RID) Code. The NIMMS and ABOM systems provide a cross-reference of store codes associ-
     ated the WSSC/SSC/EPSCs. The cross reference is used to generate document numbers for
     requisitions. System administrator may add, change, delete, or query these relationships. The first
     position of the RID is M, the second position is assigned to indicate a geographical area, and the third
     position will be the same as the second position. The organization, structure, functions, and position
     descriptions for the SSC/EPSC and WSSC/SSC/EPSC are contained in AFMCI 21-129 and AFMCI
     21-133 respectively.
     2.65.2. Each WSSC/SSC/EPSC may have (or support) a minimum of three types of NIMMS storage
     for each routing identifier. The purpose of these facilities is to hold DMAG maintenance-owned mate-
     rial on a temporary basis to assist with maintenance production. These assets are accounted for under
     NIMMS.
        2.65.2.1. Each NIMMS store area has a unique functional responsibility. A RID is assigned to
        indicate the type of temporary storage that is permitted.
        2.65.2.2. The first position of the RID of the NIMMS store facility will always be M and the sec-
        ond position will be X, Y, or Z. An X in the second position of the RID indicates AWP compo-
        nents storage, a Y indicates Production storage, and Z in the second position indicates L/M
        component storage. The third position of the NIMMS store RID will always be the same as the
        third position of the RID of the supporting WSSC/SSC/EPSC.

2.66. Material Control.
     2.66.1. Accountability. Serviceable material stored in the WSSC/SSC/EPSC is owned by Air Force
     Stock Fund (depot supply). The WSSC/SSC/EPSC balance is maintained in D035K and ABOM can
     access these balances as part of the transaction processing. The D035K balance is the accountable bal-
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                        79


  ance. When material is turned in to the WSSC/SSC/EPSC or issued out of the WSSC/SSC/EPSC,
  D035K balances are adjusted by that transaction quantity through transactions in NIMMS/ABOM.
  2.66.2. NIMMS Inventory Stores for DMAG-Owned Material.
     2.66.2.1. Identification. Disassembled end items, routed items, and material removed from pro-
     duction may be temporarily stored in the NIMMS stores. Direct and indirect material may be
     stored as long as they are ERRC N and P items. Floating stock/spares are also authorized to be
     held in NIMMS stores, but at an absolute minimum and only for temporary holding while waiting
     current production. An accumulation of floating stock in a NIMMS inventory stores is a clear indi-
     cation that the authorized amount is too high. Refer to paragraph 2.35. for floating stock policy.
     Storing excess exchange material (XD1 and XD2, respectively) is not authorized. The maximum
     time period for holding exchange material is 30 calendar days. If after 30 days no production
     requirement has materialized the exchange material is to be considered excess and should be
     turned into the WSSC/SSC/EPSC. Exchange material shall be turned in for credit rather than held
     in production NIMMS storage. By returning the assets to supply the DMAG will free up dollars to
     be used for bona-fide current requirements, ensure proper DIFM/DOTM control, and make them
     available for worldwide distribution if necessary. Long lead exchange material (for example some
     floating spares) may be held indefinitely as long as justification is documented and signed by the
     Fixer and is maintained by engineering planning.
     2.66.2.2. Authority. Storing other-than-serviceable material in the NIMMS inventory stores is not
     authorized. When absolutely necessary, such as for security reasons or production enhancement
     purposes the decision to allow temporary storage of assets in this category should be locally and
     jointly approved by the WSSC/SSC/EPSC Chief and Fixer and documented for the reasons for the
     decision.
         2.66.2.2.1. Repetitive ordering from the WSSC/SSC/EPSC is always preferred over the unau-
         thorized build up of inventories in production NIMMS inventory stores, or non-authorized
         material storage locations (i.e. pigeon-holing supplies). DLA support is contingent on steady
         ordering history that is compromised by relying on production NIMMS store for day-to-day
         requirements. This method of relying on NIMMS store for day-to-day material is not autho-
         rized under NIMMS store procedures contained in paragraph 2.67.
  2.66.3. Point of Sale.
     2.66.3.1. The JON is expensed (charged) for material issued upon receipt of the item; therefore, a
     receipt transaction must be performed for each material release. The receipt transaction is also
     used to establish an accounts payable, which is later matched to an incoming bill.
     2.66.3.2. Turn-in credit will be determined systematically at the time the turn-in transaction is
     posted to D035K.
     2.66.3.3. Excess material (material leftover from completed jobs) shall not be maintained on the
     shop floor. The material shall be turned in to the NIMMS inventory stores (awaiting evaluation for
     current needs) or immediately returned to the WSSC/SSC/EPSCs in order to maintain proper con-
     trol and accountability of assets owned by the DMAG. Local procedures will be implemented to
     ensure maintenance personnel have sufficient guidance to perform turn in of unused material. It is
     WSSC/SSC/EPSC responsibility to assist maintenance personnel in the turning in of material. If
     material is determined to be excess, the system will attempt to satisfy requirements in other
     WSSC/SSC/EPSCs with the excess. If there are no existing requirements, the material will be
80                                                                  AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


        returned to the warehouse using DOC ID D6K. As a minimum, every six months an inventory of
        all NIMMS inventory store locations shall take place to identify items that have not been con-
        sumed within the previous six month time period. These items will be turned in to supply if it is
        determined that no future requirement exist or the material is not a requirement on current G005M
        Bill of Material. If there is a verified future requirement, items should be maintained in NIMMS
        inventory stores to prevent DMAG losses when credit will not be received for a turn-in to supply.
        Due to the nature of maintenance, repair and overhaul there will occasionally be material that is
        not used for a given operation. However, extensive amounts of excess material are an indication
        that there are problems in the planning of repairs, ordering processes or shop floor discipline and
        they need to be investigated immediately.
     2.66.4. Stock Levels. No levels are computed for the items temporarily stored in NIMMS as these
     areas are used as temporary storage only and not as a stockroom for permanent or long-term storage.
     2.66.5. Vending Machine Support Process. ALC depot maintenance supervisors or other designated
     supervisors will ensure that vending machines deployed in the depot maintenance shops/cells
     designed for control of pilferable items (such as drill bits, sanding disks, batteries, etc.) properly dis-
     play adequate instructions for depot mechanic use in the event of machine malfunction or failure. If
     the vending machines contain drill bits, and/or apexes or other small tools, they must comply with the
     established standards of tool control identified in AFMCI 21-107. The clearly displayed instructions
     will specify the name of the shop supervisors or other designated supervisors (along with office sym-
     bols, phone numbers, and physical locations) on each shift who will possess the required keys for
     entry into the machines in the event of malfunction to ensure parts availability for the depot mechan-
     ics. Utilization of a key box system meeting these same objectives is optional. These instructions will
     ensure coverage for all required work shifts including swing or graveyard time periods. During the
     acquisition process for these vending machines, ALC depot maintenance personnel or their alternates
     will also ensure that adequate and timely reporting and maintenance service/repair arrangements,
     including guaranteed response times, are included in the contracts with the vending machine contrac-
     tors. This will preclude unnecessary machine down time and ensure parts availability for the depot
     mechanics. The names and phone numbers of the vending machine service contractors will also
     clearly be displayed on the machines in addition to the guaranteed vending machine contractor
     response time. Contractors responsible for providing the material designated for vending machine
     support should be held responsible for stocking and replenishing the vending machines based on ALC
     depot maintenance product directorate quantity and schedule requirements. The option to procure or
     lease the required vending machines will be at the option of each ALC.

2.67. NIMMS Storage Processing.
     2.67.1. Purpose. NIMMS inventory stores are for DMAG-owned material. The difference between
     NIMMS inventory stores and the WSSC/SSC/EPSC is that the materiel in NIMMS locations is
     DMAG owned while the materiel contained in the WSSC/SSC/EPSC is supply owned (SMAG).
        2.67.1.1. All material held in NIMMS inventory storage areas is owned by depot maintenance,
        but is managed by WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel. WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel will use ABOM
        when processing a material request. ABOM will query the NIMMS inventory records for material
        held in NIMMS inventory stores and ask if material is to be issued from there. If material exists in
        a NIMMS inventory stores location that meets the requirement, and the material has not been des-
        ignated for another project, it shall be issued before another requisition is made from the WSSC/
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                        81


     SSC/EPSC. In situations where ABOM is not available (system down), manually use NIMMS to
     search the detail records. The purpose is to avoid ordering unneeded material while ensuring the
     proper demand history is captured.
     2.67.1.2. Types of material held in NIMMS inventory storage include AWP components, L/M
     components, and backorder released material for which there is no immediate requirement. Mate-
     rial left over from repair processes may also be temporarily stored in NIMMS according to guide-
     lines in paragraph 2.66.2.1.
     2.67.1.3. Local procedures will be established to review amounts and kinds of material being held
     in NIMMS temporary storage every six months, as a minimum (this review should turn up any
     exchange material (such as floating stock) that escaped the 30 day time limit as stated in para-
     graph 2.66.2.1.). When it is determined that material is not moving into and out of these areas in
     a timely manner, joint action between maintenance and supply should be taken to correct any
     problems found to include turning in of material. NIMMS temporary storage of items is not to be
     used as a collection and holding area for material that maintenance cannot use in a timely manner.
     The inventory should also identify and rectify the improper identification of any material on
     NIMMS inventory records.
     2.67.1.4. Emphasis should not be on whether credit is received when determining disposition of
     excess material. Emphasis should be on finding the causes and taking corrective action to prevent
     future instances. Planning is responsible for conducting investigations to determine the causes of
     excess material. The Fixer is responsible for implementing corrective action.
     2.67.1.5. Material held in NIMMS store locations should be tagged or labeled with the following
     information as a minimum: NSN, part number, and noun.
  2.67.2. Inventory Store Types. There are several types of NIMMS temporary inventory storage areas
  that may be assigned to each WSSC/SSC/EPSC. Each of the areas has a specific purpose (e.g., AWP,
  L/M, or Production Storage). Store code indicates the location for routing and/or storing material.
  Each UIC has a unique store code. The UIC/Store Code table is found in the NIMMS MN093P screen.
     2.67.2.1. 'N' Awaiting Parts Store Code. The NIMMS inventory store includes a ‘W’ restriction
     code to designate AWP Stores, and to restrict issues from them. It is used to identify temporary
     storage of component parts of end items in AWP status.
         2.67.2.1.1. Material held in AWP NIMMS store can be issued upon request by maintenance to
         satisfy other requirements in shops linked to the support WSSC/SSC/EPSC. If material is
         required in a shop not linked to the support WSSC/SSC/EPSC, the material must first be trans-
         ferred to a NIMMS store that is linked to a WSSC/SSC/EPSC that supports the requesting
         shop. The purpose of this is to ensure that material held in AWP NIMMS is released only upon
         the permission of the shop that owns the asset. When material is requested from AWP storage,
         the WSSC/SSC/EPSC will release only available material and no backorder will be estab-
         lished.
         2.67.2.1.2. When material in AWP NIMMS storage is released to satisfy other requirements,
         the D035K system will allow another asset to be ordered from depot supply into the NIMMS
         store to replace it. The asset will be released from the support WSSC/SSC/EPSC, depot supply
         warehouse, or backorder released from central receiving.

     2.67.2.2. ‘X’ ‘Y’ and ‘Z’ stores are all NIF store inventory type ‘N’. NIF stores will contain
     DMAG owned material issued from supply. Unused material will be held and reissued locally.
     Inventory items may include non-standard items such as locally procured items and those manu-
     factured within the exchange activity. Inventory type “N” indicates general stores (i.e. AWP (issue
     restricted)(X), L/M (issue restricted) (Z) and the general store (Y).
     2.67.2.3. ‘S’ Specific Requirements Inventory (SRI). SRI identifies the delivery location of the
     shop where material is not routinely carried in the NIF inventory and when received material is
     charged to the end-use customer job number (i.e. line issue). This is the most common type of
     store code. It is like a direct turnover transaction. SRI stores never contain an inventory balance.
     Materials are always issued simultaneously to the requesting production shop, turned in to the NIF
     store, or returned to supply if not required for current work-in-process. This inventory processes
     both consumable and exchangeable materials.
     2.67.2.4. ‘D’ Direct Material Inventory. Material is established in a DMI store based on a bill of
     materials and the intent to take progress payments on inventory items. This material may be con-
     sumable or exchangeable. This material may contain nonstandard items, such as locally procured
     or manufactured items. Material is stocked and issued at moving-average price, recomputed for
     that line item each time a receipt is processed. There are two types of ‘DMI’ stores that are identi-
     fied as the ‘D-General store’ and the ‘D-AWP store’ and both are restricted to unfunded material
     only. All ‘D’ stores are restricted to ‘free issue to DMAG’ items.
     2.67.2.5. ‘R’ Reconciliation inventory. Materials that are not acceptable as a substitute for an
     ordered item or received after the job order number has closed are retained in Reconciliation
     Inventory pending disposition action. This material may be turned into supply, issued for a spe-
     cific job, or, in the case of consumable material, transferred to a NIF store. Also, can be used for
     discrepant material that has already been received into your NIF store that you are going to tempo-
     rarily put into the Recon store for future transfer back to supply. The NIMMS inventory store
     includes an ‘N’ restriction code to allow normal issues. If an un-suitable substitute NIIN is
     received from supply for a Material Requisition, the un-suitable NIIN will be stored in the Recon
     Store until proper action has been taken. The primary purpose is to temporarily hold material.
     NIMMS temporary storage can also be used to move excess JON costed material prior to JON clo-
     sure. Once the JON is closed, the material should be turned into supply if it fills no immediate
     requirement.
     2.67.2.6. 'F' Floating Stock/Spare Stores are NIF stores (type ‘N’) which are restricted. Floating
     stock items authorized and retained by the Product Division to support maintenance production by
     acting as replacement components for end items whose sub-assemblies have repair times that
     exceed the repair time of the end item. Items are ordered and maintained as DMAG inventory. For
     further procedure referencing ‘Floating Stock’ information, see paragraph 2.35. Generally, float-
     ing stock/spares should not be held in production NIMMS storage. Floating stock/spares should be
     consumed in the production process upon issuance. The need to hold floating stock/spares in
     NIMMS storage locations is an indicator that the computation is too high (as contained on the
     AFMC Form 100) and needs to be adjusted. Floating spares can be held in the supermarket at
     POU. Finally, material that must be protected due to security reasons prior to final disposition may
     also be temporarily held in the production NIMMS storage. Production NIMMS storage is not to
     be used to accumulate excess material for which there is no longer a current requirement.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                              83


          2.67.2.6.1. Expense material that has been backorder released and where temporary storage is
          required, must be officially turned into the NIMMS temporary storage.
       2.67.2.7. Local Manufacture Components Storage in NIMMS. This type storage is identified as
       'N' store to which parts will be received and stored and local manufacture is further designated a
       "Y" store. The NIMMS inventory store includes an ‘L’ restriction code to designate Local Man
       Stores, and to restrict issues from them. The purpose is to temporarily hold bits and pieces until all
       parts have been received and the end item is ready for assembly. This area must not be used by
       maintenance/production to stock material.
          2.67.2.7.1. All material temporarily stored in the L//M store is maintained in ABOM/
          NIMMS. In order to temporarily store material in this area, all material for the L/M Work
          order will be ordered into the L/M Module and held until all parts are received. They will then
          be issued from the Local Manufacturing Store to the Shop. WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel shall
          assist where required to ensure all turn-ins are correctly processed.
          2.67.2.7.2. In order to retrieve material stored in this area, maintenance personnel must input
          a line issue request to the applicable Local Manufacturing. NIMMS will not allow the release
          of component parts to shops not linked to the support WSSC/SSC/EPSC where material is
          stored. In order to issue component parts to a shop linked to a different WSSC/SSC/EPSC, the
          material must be transferred to the appropriate NIMMS store of the WSSC/SSC/EPSC.
NOTE: This must be a coordinated effort between gaining and losing maintenance shops and the WSSC/
SSC/EPSC.
   2.67.3. Follow these procedures (in conjunction with the NIMMS user’s manual) for turn-in of
   DMAG material.
       2.67.3.1. NIMMS screen MN045P “Turn-In to Supply” records the turn-in of material from the
       shop floor to supply. This transaction is only used for Inventory Type ‘S’ with simultaneous issue
       indicator ‘Y’. The Activity Control Record UIC must own the Store Record and the Ship-to UIC
       must be billable. Actions required are based on the ERRC Code of the material being turned in.
          2.67.3.1.1. Expense/consumable Material, ERRC Code N or P. If ‘UNIT PRICE’ is not
          entered, NIMMS will default to the standard price in the NIMMS material record for credits/
          reimbursement. The turn in action always credits the JON. The original JON used for the
          material issue should be used for the turn-in action. If the original JON is closed Reopen the
          JON and process turn-in. If the JON is so old that the customers funding has been final billed
          or the JON is purged, then process turn-in against a 'like' JON. If an open "like" JON cannot be
          determined then process the turn-in to overhead.
              2.67.3.1.1.1. If the stock fund manager has provided documented approval for reimburse-
              ment, enter ‘Y’ in ‘CREDIT EXPCTD’ field and ‘Y’ in the ‘FORCED CREDIT INDICA-
              TOR’ field. NIMMS will create an “accounts receivable” (NIMMS CD of A3) in DIFMS
              for the expected reimbursement for other than budget code 8, non MSD transactions. For
              budget code 8 transactions, MSD, then a NIMMS CD of M6 and a Loss (7290.00) will be
              established in DIFMS. JON will receive credit (J2 in DIFMS) and an account receivable
              (A4 in DIFMS) will be created.
84                                                             AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


            2.67.3.1.1.2. If the GSD has not provided documented approval for reimbursement, enter
            "N" in CREDIT EXPCTD field and leave FORCED CREDIT INDICATOR blank. Input
            JON will receive credit (J2 in DIFMS) but no accounts receivable will be built.
     2.67.3.2. Exchangeable, ERRC Code C, T, or S: Do NOT use for DIFM/DOTM carcass turn-in
     during the first 60 days (Use ABOM Exchangeable Turn-in Screen).
        2.67.3.2.1. If ‘UNIT PRICE’ is not entered, ‘AF COST CODE’ will be used to determine the
        price for the credit/reimbursement; however, for serviceable turn-ins against delinquent DIFM
        Details, enter the standard price with a ‘Y’ in CREDIT EXPCTD field.
        2.67.3.2.2. For serviceable ‘S’ cost code with numeric budget code turn-ins, enter standard
        price with a ‘Y’ in CREDIT EXPCTD field.
     2.67.3.3. The MN041P Returns Processor screen is used to return excess DMAG owned NIF
     (‘X’, ‘Y’, ‘Z’ stores) inventory to the supply system. The transaction generates a DD1348-1A
     turn-in shipping document. Always enter a ‘P’ in the ‘ACTION CODE’ field. ‘E’ is never used.
     Always enter a ‘Y’ in the ‘TO SUPPLY’ field. Always leave the ‘TO DRMO’ field blank.
        2.67.3.3.1. If the stock fund manager has provided documented approval for reimbursement,
        enter ‘Y’ in ‘CREDIT EXPCTD’ field and ‘Y’ in the ‘FORCED CREDIT INDICATOR’
        field. NIMMS will reduce the on-hand inventory, credit the inventory JON and create an
        “accounts receivable” in DIFMS for the expected reimbursement.
            2.67.3.3.1.1. If the stock fund manager has not provided documented approval for reim-
            bursement, enter ‘N’ in ‘CREDIT EXPCTD’ field and leave the ‘FORCED CREDIT
            INDICATOR’ field blank. NIMMS will reduce the on-hand inventory and create a charge
            to the overhead JON for non-credit turn-in in DIFMS. The Overhead JON for non-credit
            turn-ins can be found on the DIFMS MS192P screen. This is the General Inventory
            Adjustment Loss JON. Users will see this JON posted on the DIFMS Financial Inventory
            Control Ledger, 7310-433 report, for L3 NIMMS Code transactions. Users may also see
            the JON on the DIFMS Detail Inventory Adjustments, 7310-431 report.
            2.67.3.3.1.2. MN042P Discrepant Material Adjustment screen is used for NIF inventory
            balance gains or loss correction (D8B is a gain; D9B is a loss). The screen is also used for
            manual correction of clerical or mechanical errors that cannot be corrected by the reversal
            of the original transaction. This screen will not be used without management approval
            (AFMC Form 37, Inventory Research Worksheet). When doing corrections, it is recom-
            mended to enter a ‘Y’ in the ‘INHIB D & R’ field. This will prevent documents from being
            printed and automatic backorder release of stock from the store.
     2.67.3.4. MN044P Turn-In to NIF Store screen is used for turn-in of serviceable material to the
     ‘Y’ or ‘Z’ stores from the shop floor. This transaction always credits the JON. The original JON
     used for the material issue should be used for the turn-in action. If the original JON is closed, use
     the production overhead material JON in ‘JOB ORDER NUMBER’ field. It is recommended to
     enter a ‘Y’ in the ‘INHIB D & R’ field. This will prevent documents from being printed and auto-
     matic backorder release of stock from the store. Budget code alpha material may not be turned-in
     to a NIF store. The transaction produces a Stowage Order for quantity transacted on MN044P. If
     the ‘Y’ is not entered in the INHIB D & R field, the turn-in action may generate SRI and Backo-
     rder Release documents at the applicable NIF store. Stowage orders are printed at the turn-in store.
     Stowage order identifies where the material should be stored.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                           85


       2.67.3.5. Cost accounting enters receipts for certain material as a total indirect cost rather than
       individually for each item. For IPV, cost accounting enters the total amount billed. For Govern-
       ment Purchase Card, cost accounting enters the monthly payment for each card. For Purple Hub
       (e.g., fuel), cost accounting enters the total monthly billing from DLA. Price changes in NIMMS
       Stores using the MN110P screen in NIMMS require Cost Accounting written approval for
       changes that impact DIFMS financials. NOTE: Additional information can be found in the
       DIFMS user’s manual.
   2.67.4. Level of Inventory Management Certification. Reference the AFMC Form 37. Certification
   level for Material Support Division is specified in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 3, Part Two, Chapter 7.
   Level of Certification for Depot Maintenance owned material (‘X’, ‘Y’, and ‘Z’ Stores) will be as fol-
   lows:
   Dollar Value - Approval Level
   Up to $15,000.00 - Flight Supervisor
   Up to $100,000.00 - Squadron Commander
   Up to $500,000.00 - Group Commander
   Over $500,000.00 - Wing Commander

2.68. Material Transfer. This process is the movement of material stored in one area to a different area.
There is no ownership transfer between maintenance and depot supply during a material transfer. The fol-
lowing logic applies to the transfer of material in and out of a WSSC/SSC/EPSC and in and out of
NIMMS inventory store provided by a WSSC/SSC/EPSC.
   2.68.1. D035K system will allow transfer of material from one WSSC/SSC/EPSC to any other
   WSSC/SSC/EPSC.
   2.68.2. D035K will NOT allow transfer of material from a WSSC/SSC/EPSC to a NIMMS inventory
   store. Such transfers must be processed using material requisition procedures against a valid require-
   ment.
   2.68.3. NIMMS will allow transfer of material from a NIMMS inventory store to any other NIMMS
   store. This will be accomplished using the MN013P screen.
   2.68.4. Material cannot be transferred from a NIMMS NIF store to a WSSC/SSC/EPSC. When mate-
   rial is moved from a NIMMS NIF store to a WSSC/SSC/EPSC, then a turn-in transaction must be pro-
   cessed.

Section 2O—Contractor Acquired Property (CAP), Local Purchase, and Government Purchase Card
(GPC)

2.69. CAP Procedures. CAP provides depot maintenance the authorization and capability to obtain
parts not available in the normal supply system (i.e., Federal Supply System (FSS)) to meet production
requirements. This includes both MSD and GSD items. Unlike standard local purchase procedures con-
ducted by depot supply using stock funds, CAP authorizes the use of DMAG funds. For centrally man-
aged items, the DMAG must coordinate with the prime MM (AF managed items) or HQ DLA for DLA
managed items to initiate CAP procedures for like items.
86                                                               AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     2.69.1. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC supporting the DMAG organization requesting the material will sub-
     mit a priority requisition to establish a due-in/due-out into the D035K supply system with a Y force
     credit indicator in Column 69. If the EDD is not sufficient to meet workload requirements the WSSC/
     SSC/EPSC supporting the DMAG organization requesting the material will contact the prime MM
     (AF managed items) or HQ DLA for DLA managed items to verify non-availability of the materiel in
     the FSS. If materiel cannot be procured in time to meet production schedules then a request for
     approval can be made to the prime MM (AF managed items) or HQ DLA (DLA managed items) to
     initiate CAP procedures. The IM can authorize local purchase for a central or local procured item for
     one-time emergency buy to meet scheduled delivery dates.
     2.69.2. DMAG inventories will not grow above current levels without HQ AFMC/A4 authorization.
     Only immediate need quantities will be procured. DMAG may only purchase that material necessary
     to satisfy inducted work. Materiel may not be bought in advance of need or for maintenance inven-
     tory. The IM will be kept informed of the transaction so that prior consumption data will be entered
     into D035K by WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel.
     2.69.3. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC supporting the DMAG organization will provide the justification and
     the materiel will be procured by a fully warranted procurement officer. The DMAG may direct cite
     DMAG obligation authority on the purchase order.
        2.69.3.1. The DMAG may direct cite DMAG obligation authority on the purchase order.
     2.69.4. When the materiel is received and signed for the DD Form 250, Material Inspection and
     Receiving Report, will be processed to the MXG CAP monitor. The DD 250 will be forwarded to the
     primary contracting officer and to DAO-DE for the local purchase payment. At this point, the CAP
     monitor should contact the retail IM to process the wash post action.
     2.69.5. Each MXG CAP monitor will retain copies of the DD Form 250, the D035K-BA6-DM-L41
     that shows the D4/D7 wash post transactions, and a copy of the AFMC Form 36, Purchase Request,
     used to procure the materiel.
        2.69.5.1. MXG CAP monitors will track the number of requisitions processed monthly using
        CAP procedures, monthly quantity and dollar value for items procured using CAP and number of
        man-hours expended monthly on CAP procedures. This data shall be maintained for at least one
        year and can be either in paper or electronic format. CAP is considered a workaround process only
        to be used when normal supply functions fail to provide needed parts in a timely manner to sup-
        port depot production. The above data should be used to determine if trends in supply support are
        developing and for discussion topics at DREP/AREP meetings. SCMs should be notified of all
        supply support problems driving CAP actions.
     2.69.6. After the CAP procedures have been completed copies of the above documentation (i.e. DD
     Form 250, etc.) must be forwarded to the center financial management organization so that the docu-
     mentation can be verified in NIMMS/DIFMS for cost adjustment. Cost accounting will then do a cost
     transfer in DIFMS.
     2.69.7. Each depot utilizing CAP is expected to setup operating instructions within the framework of
     paragraph 2.69.

2.70. Local Purchase. Local purchase policy and procedures are contained in AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 1,
Part One, Vol. 3, Part Two. Local Purchase is a supply function conducted by either depot supply person-
nel or WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel using stock funds (the exception is the Government Purchase Card).
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                            87


Depot maintenance is not authorized to conduct local purchase using DMAG funds (see CAP procedures
above). Locally purchasing material to satisfy parts shortages is considered a workaround process for
items that are not coded local purchase. WSSC/SSC/EPSC’s shall track by MXG the number of requisi-
tions processed monthly using local purchase procedures (only those items not coded local purchase),
monthly quantity and dollar value for items procured using local purchase, and number of man-hours
expended monthly on local purchase procedures. The above data shall be maintained for at least one year
and be used to determine if trends in supply support are developing and for discussion topics at DREP/
AREP meetings. SCMs should be notified of all supply support problems driving local purchase actions.

2.71. Government Purchase Card (GPC). DMAG personnel are authorized use of the GPC to procure
both indirect (production overhead or general and administrative requirements) and direct material
(including weapon system and commodity spare parts) that would ordinarily be ordered through the depot
supply system, but are not currently available from stock or the existing depot supply system can not sat-
isfy or meet depot maintenance production schedule requirements.
   2.71.1. Policy and guidelines for approved use of the GPC using DMAG funds are as follows:
       2.71.1.1. Situations that are creating or causing MICAPs, emergency work stoppage situations, or
       unacceptable maintenance production delays in depot maintenance shops.
       2.71.1.2. Purchases must be within the micro-purchase threshold.
       2.71.1.3. WSSC/SSC/EPSC chiefs or Fixers determine that the GPC is the most cost effective and
       timely method or tool of providing required weapon systems parts support for depot maintenance.
       2.71.1.4. Maintenance Squadrons are responsible for ensuring the WSSC/SSC/EPSCs correctly
       enter demand data into the D035K for weapon system items, except for items coded local pur-
       chase. This will ensure that the demand history is captured and the correct stock level is estab-
       lished.
       2.71.1.5. The GPC is authorized to be used to purchase both indirect and direct material under
       MICAP, emergency work stoppage conditions, or unacceptable maintenance production delays,
       when it is not available from stock or the existing supply system to meet production requirements.
       It will be used by depot maintenance production personnel (or by any supply personnel assigned
       to the MXG) in direct support of weapon system production requirements, and is approved for
       decentralized use in the Depot Maintenance production shop environment.
       2.71.1.6. Maintenance Squadrons are responsible for ensuring that both indirect and direct mate-
       rial purchases are input into the (DMAPS/NIMMS). This includes both office supplies and indi-
       rect material purchased for depot repair jobs.
       2.71.1.7. Maintenance Squadrons should ensure local procedures are correctly utilized to make
       sure indirect and direct material items purchased with the GPC are properly recorded in the
       accounting systems.
       2.71.1.8. Operational Safety Suitability and Effectiveness Policy (AFI 63-1201) holds single
       managers accountable for insuring that material procured to support their weapon systems is the
       correct configuration and procured from qualified vendors. AFMCI 63-1201 assigns the engineer-
       ing accountability to the chief/lead engineer in support of their single manager. Prior to procuring
       weapon system specific indirect or direct material (including any safety of flight items) with the
       GPC, the DMAG cardholder must obtain written approval from the cognizant Air Force engineer-
88                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


        ing design authority for the item to ensure that the operational safety, suitability, and effectiveness
        is maintained. This includes verification that the part number being procured is the correct config-
        uration/effectivity and meets all required engineering and technical performance/specification
        parameters. This written approval shall also include a statement that verifies the selected vendor is
        a qualified supplier or source of that material. Prior to final acceptance, the cognizant Air Force
        engineering design authority shall verify that the material being delivered is the material that was
        authorized to be purchased. Specific Air Force design authority approvals shall also be required
        when parts purchased involving waivers, deviations, and or substitutions are initiated.
        2.71.1.9. DMAG personnel must request cancellation of the existing supply back-order unless a
        future requirement exists. This will help prevent receiving and paying for the same material twice.
        2.71.1.10. The requirement to pay reasonable prices on all GPC purchases is found in FAR
        13.202(a) and is grounded in common sense. If there is any doubt in the purchaser’s mind as to the
        reasonableness of a price, or if the purchaser has no knowledge of what a reasonable price would
        be, the cardholder must verify that the proposed purchase prices are reasonable. This can be
        accomplished in any of a number of ways such as comparing prices between different sources,
        comparison to previous prices paid, comparison to published catalogs or list prices, and compari-
        son to latest acquisition cost if the item is normally a stocked item.
     2.71.2. Air Force Government Purchase Card policy is contained in AFI 64-117, Air Force Govern-
     ment-Wide Purchase Card (GPC) Program. Users are directed to the following Air Force web site to
     obtain the latest guidance: https://www.safaq.hq.af.mil/contracting/restricted/index.cfm. All
     DMAG organizations utilizing DMAG funded GPC shall implement a process to track the number of
     requisitions and units of repair parts procured using the GPC (office supplies and other purchases need
     not be tracked to this degree). Each Maintenance Wing organization shall be accountable for ensuring
     this process is established. In addition, the cost of such purchases shall be tracked and compared
     against the latest acquisition cost if the item was bought using the depot supply system (if applicable).
     This data is to be collected on a monthly basis and maintained for at least one year. This data should
     be provided to Fixers, depot maintenance managers (DMMs), and SCMs during center metric reviews
     and weekly DREP/AREP meetings to ensure a complete understanding of costs and supply system
     constraints.

                                    BILLS OF MATERIAL (BOM)

Section 3A—Instructions and Responsibilities

3.1. General. This chapter applies to the ALCs including all MXGs and depot maintenance workloads.
This chapter is designed to provide guidance and policy concerning the G005M BOM and related material
support. The BOM, or material standard, is a descriptive and quantitative listing of planned material and
components required to manufacture, overhaul, or repair a designated end item, assembly, or subassem-
bly. The purpose of establishing a BOM is to plan for material in support of production maintenance
workloads, initiate costing for the depot maintenance systems, and provide a mechanism to control mate-
rial usage. The ability of depot maintenance to plan, budget, receive material, and produce serviceable end
items in a timely and cost effective manner depends in part upon the Depot Maintenance Material Support
System (G005M).

3.2. Policy.
   3.2.1. Maintenance and Accuracy. Accurate material standards are a mandatory requirement. The
   BOMs provide the composite database that identifies the material that is required for repair and to
   determine standard material costs required to develop End Item Sales Prices (EISP). It is the responsi-
   bility of the planning function acting on behalf of the Fixer to ensure accurate BOMs are established
   and maintained. This includes the replacement factors, occurrence factors, and units per assembly
   UPA that are components of the BOM. The Fixer shall ensure WSSC/SSC/EPSC are developing and
   maintaining accurate BOMs.
   3.2.2. Correct Ordering Practices. Management is responsible to provide training to all involved per-
   sonnel with emphasis on the critical need for personnel to request, issue, and plan material for only the
   applicable end item production number (PDN). Shop personnel must be trained to order material
   against the proper PDN and operation number. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC must verify production num-
   ber, RCC and operation numbers are valid prior to processing requisitions. This two-step check is crit-
   ical to maintaining accurate standards. If the requested amount of material exceeds the UPA, the
   override approval authority resides with the Planner.
   3.2.3. Material Classification. Each ALC must develop and validate the existence of local criteria/
   guidance as to when it is appropriate to override the automatic material classification code assignment
   in G005M. The G005M will make an initial assignment, however, it is the planner’s responsibility to
   determine if this classification is correct and change it if it is not. The planner must make the final
   determination of what is to be planned as direct and indirect by changing the material classification
   and cost code. Planners can also do this when initially planning the material by assigning a cost code
   override. In general, the policy is to classify material as direct where possible to facilitate the tracking
   of costs and usage to the end item level.
   3.2.4. Suppression. Suppression of G005M component and production number analysis will require
   Fixer or group level approval. In addition, a letter must be submitted to the G005M functional OPR
   for action. This letter is good for one year at which time suppression should be removed by the
   G005M OPR, unless a renewal letter has been received and approved.
90                                                                  AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     3.2.5. Documentation. BOMs and documentation for changes to the BOM are maintained electroni-
     cally in G005M.
     3.2.6. Manual Changes to BOMs. On a normal basis, replacement factors should not be manually
     changed. Replacement factors may degrade, however, if workaround usage history is not reaching the
     G005M. Workarounds include cannibalizations, local purchase, CAP, local manufacturing, Engineer-
     ing Change Proposals, etc. If these workarounds are not conducted properly using established proce-
     dures, there is a probability that this usage history will not reach the G005M. Replacement factors
     may be manually changed to fix errors, post workaround data that may not have reached the G005M
     system, or to raise a factor that may have dropped due to a parts shortage.
     3.2.7. Production Analysis Quantity (PAQ). Planners must set and maintain the PAQ in the G005M.
     The G005M default setting is 25 but the Planner may adjust it. The G005M will by default perform
     automatic analysis if the PAQ has not been met in the last four consecutive quarters. Planners will set
     the PAQ based on the type of workload. Low volume workloads will have a lower PAQ while higher
     volume workloads can be set higher. The goal is to set the PAQ at a level to allow quarterly analysis
     to be performed at least twice a year.
     3.2.8. Review requirements. Every BOM shall be reviewed continually by the assigned planners to
     validate their accuracy in terms of correct components, UPA, replacement factors, occurrence factors,
     and I&S planning. Reviews will occur on an exception basis or when changes to the work scope,
     materials, or WCD content dictate. The Fixer will ensure that formal reviews are held to periodically
     validate the accuracy of all BOMs. When available, the occurrence factor from G097 will be used.
     Documentation (electronic) will be maintained to identify when the reviews are conducted and the
     results obtained along with the resulting management actions to be taken.
     3.2.9. RESERVED.
     3.2.10. Material Usage. The G005M computes actual replacement factors based on actual material
     consumption. The variance between planned and actual consumption of material for a production
     number can be found in the G005M/093/097 reports. For BOMs falling into the 70% or less accuracy
     category (as shown on the G005M-411/412 reports) the possibility of abnormal/excessive usage of
     component parts should be investigated by the engineering planning function and assisted by the
     MXSG function where necessary. Other possibilities are a significant increase in workload (the same
     G005M output reports will show end items produced by PDN), material price increases, material price
     errors, or use of substitute material. The investigation shall be used to explain significant deviations to
     management at both the ALC and HQ AFMC levels and to justify corrective action where necessary
     (BOM adjustments, target expense adjustments, review of ordering practices, etc.). Material usage
     shall be monitored continuously, and be investigated as G005M accuracy reports indicate.
     3.2.11. BOM Stock List Changes. During the stock list change cycle, if the acquisition advice code
     (AAC) changes to V or X (terminal items to be used until stock exhausted) the G005M prints a mes-
     sage on the G005M-093, BOM Exception Worksheet that states Terminal Item, Substitute Required.
     This report, along with the G005M-061, Bill of Material Transaction Register and G005M-001, Error
     Notification Report provides the Planner visibility of the changes and recommendations made on the
     BOM during the month and allows the Planner to file maintain the BOM prior to quarterly analysis.
     The Planner should research the items with AAC V or X in D043A to find a suitable substitute. When
     the AAC changes to Y this indicates, the item is no longer authorized for procurement and the G005M
     will automatically send stock number to the Planner “To Do” list for review. If a substitute is not
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                              91


   found prior to quarterly analysis, the component may disappear from the BOM. When researching a
   stock number or adding a new component item, it is possible to interrogate the G005M Interchange-
   ability and Substitutability, (I&S) database and display the total I&S family. All stock numbers con-
   tained in the family will be included when a family member resides as an item in G005M. The
   equipment specialist/engineer will coordinate the engineering BOM change with depot supply and the
   appropriate item manager to ensure the substitute item is authentic, available in stock, and procurable.
   The ES/Engineer will provide suitable substitutes to the Planner upon request.
   3.2.12. Accessibility and Security. Planners are responsible for BOM build and maintenance. As
   such, only Planners are authorized to make changes (input, update, delete fields/records) to BOMs in
   the G005M. Planners are only authorized to make changes (input, update, delete fields/records) to
   BOMs assigned to them.
   3.2.13. Indirect Material. Indirect material (cost code L) may be carried on the BOM for visibility
   purposes. The G005M will show the items with the replacement percent field as a zero (0). The
   G005M does not process or analyze indirect material. For end items where a large percentage of com-
   ponents are planned as indirect, it may be beneficial to the planning function to carry indirect material
   on the BOM. Another option is to reclassify it as direct if visibility and control is desired. Cost is not
   used to determine indirect material.
       3.2.13.1. IPV supplied material. Material that is available through IPV will not be ordered
       through normal supply processes except when required to support remote operating activities, pro-
       duction of items with very low end item sales prices, or temporary jobs.
   3.2.14. Unplanned Issues. Unplanned issues as indicated on the Unplanned Issue Report (G005M/
   099) are one indication of BOM inaccuracy. The planning function shall use the reports to investigate
   why the item was not planned, or if it was erroneously ordered against the wrong production or oper-
   ation number. If the item was ordered erroneously, action shall be taken to correct the data systems to
   ensure costs and usage are captured correctly. If the item will be used, again on a recurring basis, take
   action to plan the item on the BOM.
   3.2.15. The ABOM BOM Management functions are used to support unexpected planning for mate-
   rials and components required to manufacture, overhaul, or repair a designated end item, assembly, or
   subassembly. Users may add, change, delete or inquire a specific Bill of Material. BOM Management,
   has restricted access assigned by the System Administrator.
       3.2.15.1. BOM updates are processed in G004L and G005M. The BOM Management functions in
       ABOM are used to support unexpected planning for materials and components required to manu-
       facture, overhaul, or repair a designated end item, assembly, or subassembly. Users may add,
       change, delete, or query a specific Bill of Material: Permanent, Temporary, Local Manufacturing,
       and Indirect Manufacturing. All screens related to BOM processing are accessed through the
       BOM Management Menu screen. The user may query BOM records.
       3.2.15.2. When a BOM Maintenance Update is processed in ABOM and not in G004L or
       G005M, the update must be input into the systems the same day, or the update will fall out of
       ABOM. If an update is processed in G004L or G005M, an interface file updates ABOM. ABOM
       then edits against the BOMs in G004L and G005M.
NOTE: When planning assistance is not available (weekends, holidays, off-shifts), the ABOM
non-BOM function may be utilized for requisitioning. The usage will be passed to G005M. A screen print
of the requisition screen (with the error message) will be provided to the Planner.

        3.2.15.3. ABOM provides a capability for research.
            3.2.15.3.1. The ABOM BOM Management Audit Trail Inquiry Menu Screen displays a his-
            torical record of BOM maintenance. This record is sorted by the data element selected. The
            Display/Print Menu allows the user to re-display sections of the report, print the entire report
            or sections of the report, or return to the Audit Trial Inquiry Menu screen. The option to print
            the Permanent, Temporary, Local Manufacturing, or Indirect sections of the Audit Trail
            Report exists.
            3.2.15.3.2. The ABOM Query option allows searches on all BOM types with the particular
            data entered. BOM files are grouped on individual screens according to the BOM type.

3.3. Overview. Listed below is a brief overview of the material process through the G005M system.
     3.3.1. Lists of replacement component parts, their UPA, and replacement percentages are established
     as BOMs in the G005M system. The D200F, Requirements Management System, Application, Pro-
     grams, and Indentures (API) subsystem may be used as the first source of data when planning new
     BOMs. The BOM is established automatically when the data is returned from D200F. If no data is
     returned, the planner can manually establish the BOM in G005M.
     3.3.2. BOMs are used in building end item sales prices and budgets.
     3.3.3. D230, Material Processing System (MPS), uses G005M BOM data in its issue/request
     front-end edit capability and feeds ABOM.
     3.3.4. BOM data is compared mechanically by G005M to actual usage as a closed loop feedback to
     help ensure issues were charged correctly and/or refine BOMs for future pricing, budgeting, parts pro-
     jections, and other management measures.
     3.3.5. BOM data is used by the Reparability Forecast Model (RFM) to forecast direct material parts
     requirements to DLA. BOM data used by RFM may include planning BOMs, commonly called
     P-BOMs.

3.4. Systems Interfaces. BOMs are dependent on the following data management systems:
     3.4.1. G005M, Depot Maintenance Material Support System. The G005M system is used to store,
     update, and retrieve data on standard BOMs developed by industrial engineering technicians for direct
     support of items repaired by the maintenance MXGs. The G005M contains the BOM's for permanent
     production numbers. NOTE: Use of the G005M system is described in AFMCM 21-5, Depot Main-
     tenance Material Support System G005M Users Manual.
     3.4.2. G004L, Job Order Production Master System. The G004L system provides the basis for job
     order costing by end item identity. The G004L contains the BOMs for temporary workloads.
     3.4.3. D230 MPS. MPS processes transactions to ABOM for requesting material and conducts a
     front-end edit. Requests that pass the ABOM edit are sent to D035K to complete the material request
     process. Transactions that fail ABOM edits are returned to MPS for research and action.
     3.4.4. ABOM. ABOM is used to order and issue material and acts as a front-end edit processor to
     NIMMS, which in turn processes transactions to G402A as a pass-through to D035K and maintains
     transaction history. Use of ABOM is described in the user manual.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                            93


   3.4.5. D035K, Wholesale, and Retail Receiving/Shipping System (WARRS). The D035K is the
   accountable supply system that orders, issues, and receives material in order to provide overall supply
   support. Use of the D035K system is described in AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Two.
   3.4.6. DIFMS. Provides core accounting system portion of DMAPS. System includes several sub-
   systems: Cash, Labor, Other Cost, Material, Cost Summary, Job Order/Customer Order (JO/CO),
   Billing, General Ledger Accounts, (GLA), Purge & History, System Parameters, and Fixed Asset
   Accounting (FAA). These subsystems work in concert to provide field level activities with funds con-
   trol, accounting for budget execution, and management information.
   3.4.7. NIMMS. NIMMS reports cost of actual material consumed by depot maintenance in the pro-
   cess of restoring reparable AF equipment to a serviceable condition. The G005M uses requisition data
   to update BOM standards. NIMMS and DIFMS share the same database; all material costs are passed
   to DIFMS.
   3.4.8. D200F—API. API provides an integrated repository of indentured item applications data,
   weapon system force structure program activity, item identification, and cataloging data for require-
   ments determination systems. Indenture structure has next higher assemblies with their direct compo-
   nents parts, allowing weapon systems item related relationships to be traversed in the indenture
   structure from top-down or bottom-up.

3.5. Responsibilities. It is imperative that BOMs contain data that is accurate and current. Numerous
personnel affect the accuracy of BOMs that in turn affect usage projections and out-year end item sales
price (EISP) development. Personnel from production, WSSC/SSC/EPSC, planning, finance/budget, and
overhead staff functions can influence BOM accuracy and the necessary refinement process. Technicians,
planners, and WSSC/SSC/EPSC personnel will ensure accurate accounting of material usage through
supply discipline in the maintenance repair environment. Accurate accounting of material usage leads
directly to accurate BOMs.
   3.5.1. Planners shall:
       3.5.1.1. Periodically review and justify the need for suppression of usage analysis for production
       end items and components at the stock number level. Suppression shall be kept at an absolute min-
       imum. Provides recommendations to the appropriate Fixer and group level. The MXG is then
       required to sign out a letter of justification to the G005M System Monitor in order for the suppres-
       sion to take place. This letter of justification should outline the production number(s) to be sup-
       pressed, the specific reason why, and the expected duration of suppression.
       3.5.1.2. Review, verify, and correct, as appropriate, the G005M replacement percentages for
       components that are used for multiple production numbers within a group.
       3.5.1.3. G005M Daily Transaction Register (G005M-061). This report is produced daily and
       records the Planner actions to the BOM. This report can be used to review the end item, operation,
       component, and part number and cage code changes to the BOM, in addition to estimated BOM
       file maintenance actions
       3.5.1.4. Interrogate the Planners To Do Listing for BOM requests from D200F, component items
       pending terminal acquisition status, end items with 5 Quarters No Production and end items
       flagged Inactive with 6 Quarters No Production. The planner should evaluate the messages and
       take action where judged to be necessary.
94                                                            AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     3.5.1.5. Review the monthly BOM Exception Worksheet (G005M-093) and the Quarterly Mate-
     rial Analysis Exception Report (G005M-097) for automated computer-generated recommenda-
     tions or changes to the BOMs. The Planner must evaluate the recommendations and take action
     where required.
     3.5.1.6. Monitor material usage per paragraph 3.2.10. Review the Material Analysis Exception
     Report (M097) for excessive material usage. Initiate a production shop review where excessive
     usage is found. The review will identify the causes of the excessive material usage. The planner
     shall work with the Fixer and/or WSSC/SSC/EPSC chief to rectify the situation.
     3.5.1.7. Monthly, review the Unplanned Issue Report (G005M-099) for NSNs that were received
     from NIMMS and were costed to the indicated production number as unplanned material.
     (NIMMS/DIFMS costs and performs error checks on material consumed by depot maintenance.
     The system also collects cost for local manufacturing and recycles suspended material errors.)
     Validate whether or not the item needs to be planned by investigating the reason for the unplanned
     issue. If issues have been charged to the wrong production number, delete from the wrong produc-
     tion number and add to the correct production number.
     3.5.1.8. Maintain the PAQ at a level to ensure quarterly analysis is performed, preferably on a
     quarterly basis, but at least twice a year by the G005M.
     3.5.1.9. Perform mandatory BOM reviews to ensure that all BOMs are reviewed periodically. The
     reviews should verify that the BOMs reviewed reflect accurate data. If they do not, the BOM
     should be manually updated to implement the needed corrections. This review shall take place
     shortly after the quarterly analysis cycle of the G005M. This review will serve as validation that
     the current BOM reflects the best actual standard based on the most current data. The Fixer will
     periodically validate and confirm the accuracy of assigned BOMs with the members of the sup-
     portability team, which includes as a minimum planners, equipment specialist, IM, and the
     assigned system engineers or their designated alternates. Formal minutes will be documented, pre-
     pared, signed, and made available to audit personnel as requested.
     3.5.1.10. Make final determination of what is to be planned direct and indirect in the G005M by
     changing the material classification and cost code if necessary. Planners should strive to classify
     and plan material as direct within the guidelines of paragraph 2.9. However, for material that is
     available from IPV, planners should override the expense code to indicate "indirect".
     3.5.1.11. Maintain strict control of G005M user ID and password. Planners must not change any
     BOMs in the G005M for which they are not assigned.
     3.5.1.12. Plan the least preferred item in an I&S group (as identified in D043A) that will perform
     the intended function. When establishing a BOM in G005M, the least preferred item on I&S link-
     age that will accomplish the mission will be used. Reference Paragraph 3.11. I&S Terms
     Explained.
     3.5.1.13. Support the forecasting process by ensuring BOMs are accurate and up to date. The
     forecasting process is contingent on clean BOMs. Utilize P-BOMs as required to support the fore-
     casting process. (Reference AFMCI 23-108 for details on forecasting).
     3.5.1.14. Verify the production number and operation number that material is ordered against to
     ensure that they are correct. By using the ABOM front-end edit the WSSC/SSC/EPSC will be
     notified of all production requisitions that deviate from the BOM. The WSSC/SSC/EPSC should
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                            95


     work with the planner to determine the reason for the edit (wrong production number, wrong stock
     number, ordering too much for the job, etc.). The WSSC/SSC/EPSC should never override
     ABOM on their own accord. The planner is required to work with the shop supervisor to obtain
     approval.
     3.5.1.15. Ensure that workaround data not captured in the D035K or NIMMS is manually input.
     This is critical to ensure that complete material usage data is reaching G005M so that replacement
     factors can remain up to date and demand history is reaching D035K. Workarounds include but
     are not limited to local purchases, CAP, local manufacturing, cannibalization, etc.
     3.5.1.16. Review (G005M-411 and -412, respectively) to determine production numbers and
     RCCs where production support functions accuracy has fallen below 70%. Those BOMs with a
     percentage of accuracy falling below 70% production support function accuracy should receive
     priority review to determine why material is being incorrectly ordered. The goal is 90% accuracy
     at all levels of review (MXG, planner, PDN, etc.).
  3.5.2. Maintenance Groups shall:
     3.5.2.1. Utilize the quarterly G005M-411/412 reports and monthly G005M-099 reports to track
     BOM accuracy. BOM accuracy and unplanned issues should be tracked, as a minimum, by MXG.
     MXGs should be looking for trends. Planners and WSSC/SSC/EPSCs should be tracking their
     own production number to isolate those BOMs that need immediate attention.
     3.5.2.2. Ensure that an issue certification (override) policy in conformance with paragraph 2.16.
     is developed and utilized. Requests for material not contained on the BOM should not be pro-
     cessed without shop supervisor approval. This approval should be documented and provided to the
     Planner who may add the item to the BOM if the item is not for a one-time use.
     3.5.2.3. Ensure production personnel are advised that any material they order will affect the end
     item sales price (EISP) and the percent of accuracy as calculated on the G005M Quarterly BOM
     Exception Reports (G005M-411 and G005M-412). Production personnel will only request what
     they need against the applicable JON.
     3.5.2.4. Ensure shop supervisors and/or Fixers are coordinating and communicating any
     workarounds they conduct with the WSSC/SSC/EPSC chief to ensure the data systems reflect
     proper usage and costing.
     3.5.2.5. Institute metrics in conjunction with MXW as explained in paragraph 3.2.9.
  3.5.3. G005M System Monitor.
     3.5.3.1. Maintain current file listing of all production control numbers and stock numbers for
     which quarterly automatic usage analysis is suppressed.
     3.5.3.2. Provide the suppression list to planning for validating the appropriateness of suppression.
     Planners must review and justify the need for suppression of production end items and compo-
     nents at the stock number level. Suppression should be kept at an absolute minimum. The Planner
     organization is responsible for recommending the suppression of production end items and com-
     ponents to the applicable Fixer and group level. The system monitor will only suppress analysis
     for which he has a letter of justification from the group level or Fixer. Letters of justification are
     good for one year.

Section 3B—Material Supportability

3.6. General.
     3.6.1. EXPRESS USERS ONLY. EXPRESS has a supportability module built in. The supportability
     module takes the prioritized repair list from EXPRESS and determines whether the required items can
     be repaired based on four evaluation criteria: carcass availability, repair parts availability, repair funds
     availability, and shop capacity availability. Material shortage information is provided in various short-
     age reports as provided by EXPRESS. The intent of these reports is to provide the Fixer, maintenance
     groups, the prime MMs, and SSC/EPSC with a listing that will identify the component parts that are
     short in supporting bona fide requirements. The SSC/EPSC is responsible to review EXPRESS mate-
     rial shortage reports to verify requirements, upgrade priorities, or take other actions to expedite acqui-
     sition of needed parts. EPS also is utilized to examine supportability. Each system has its own unique
     limitation that precludes the WSSC/SSC/EPSC and maintenance production personnel from relying
     on either tool alone. The G005M has an interface to both EXPRESS and ABOM that provides both
     systems BOM information. WSSC/SSC/EPSC functions should examine all tools available, including
     EXPRESS and EPS, to determine the support posture for the components (as found on the BOM)
     required meeting repair requirements.
     3.6.2. The requirements for supportability reviews are outlined in AFMCI 21-133 for AREP and
     21-129 for DREP.

Section 3C—BOM Guidelines and Development

3.7. General. BOMs are developed to record all direct materials required to support the repair of specific
end items and are the basis for:
     3.7.1. Identifying material required to perform repairs.
     3.7.2. Compiling material standard costs that are an integral part of DMAG sales prices.
     3.7.3. Establishing the DMAG sales price.
     3.7.4. Providing a controlling mechanism for cost and usage of material.
     3.7.5. Conducting forecasts using the RFM data system

3.8. Guidelines.
     3.8.1. BOMs contain two types of records in G005M:
        3.8.1.1. Standard Records. These are used to develop direct material costs. They contain UPAs,
        replacement factors, and occurrence factors.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                             97


       3.8.1.2. Nonstandard Records. These are included in the BOM for identification only, and are not
       used to compute material requirements or affect material sales price. These are cost code L items
       classified as indirect material. They contain no replacement factor and are placed on the BOM for
       visibility purposes only.
   3.8.2. Exemptions. Classified end items or components that are designated as classified -- confiden-
   tial, secret, or top secret -- and associated classified technical data (i.e., TOs, blueprints, drawings,
   etc.) will not be entered as a G005M Bill of Material. One exception applies. If the end item or com-
   ponent is designated as classified only because of a software load (such as operation flight program
   (OFP) changes), then they may be entered into the G005M system. This instruction does not overrule
   local or federal security procedures for handling classified items.
       3.8.2.1. An acceptable practice for dealing with classified end items in the G005M system is to
       separate the end item identity from the aggregation of information contained in the complete
       BOM.
       3.8.2.2. Because there are circumstances, which require the automatic cost tracking associated
       with an end item model number in the G005M system, an M-29 transaction will be used as the
       approved method for entering the unclassified and limited description information (including
       model number and nomenclature) of classified end items in the G005M system. This permits
       tracking at end item level in the G005M system.
       3.8.2.3. Responsible Planners will need to review the monthly A-G005M-106 report to verify
       correct costing of the M-29 (low volume) BOM. An M-29C transaction will be accomplished on
       any production number requiring update. Site OPRs for the G005M must conduct follow-on
       reviews of the database to ensure that complete BOMs of classified end items are not established.
   3.8.3. Inclusions. Indirect material may (not mandatory) be included as a nonstandard record in the
   BOM. This is recommended for complete visibility of all material requirements if the addition of said
   material does not negatively impact the size and accuracy of the BOM. Indirect material on the BOM
   can cause problems if production personnel attempt to order the material against the production num-
   ber. Large BOMs may begin to get cluttered and become unmanageable. The planner shall weigh the
   pluses and minuses of maintaining indirect material. Inclusion of indirect material is at planner discre-
   tion.
NOTE: Indirect material is planned in G005M sometimes just for visibility.

3.9. Development.
   3.9.1. For aircraft engine overhaul, develop by type model series (TMS), PDN, and operation num-
   ber. Aircraft engines will not be entered in an aircraft material standard as a replacement percent to
   support a repair program. If a TMS is supported with both two levels of maintenance and three levels
   of maintenance, a separate BOM shall be built for each workload.
   3.9.2. BOMs for aircraft projects will be developed by MDS, PDN, and operation number. Establish-
   ing one large BOM for an aircraft family is not required. MDS for the purposes of BOM development
   is a standard seven-position nomenclature (see glossary). Each unique MDS shall have an associated
   PDN in G004L and G005M. If MDS commonality is greater than 75 percent, multiple MDS may be
   planned on a single G005M BOM.
98                                                                 AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


     3.9.3. For other than aircraft and aircraft engines, develop BOMs by end item, PDN, and operation
     number.
     3.9.4. Issue Consolidation. The use of the G005M issue consolidation function is no longer autho-
     rized. The G005M has an option to roll up all issues against a particular production number to one
     operation per group, regardless of the operation number posted to the issue. This option is activated by
     use of the M34 transaction. This will then cause all issues against a production number to be posted to
     one operation per group. Centers are expected to plan and order material by operation number and
     eliminate the practice of using roll-up operation numbers. Material issues are tracked through NIMMS
     by PDN, operation number, and RCC. This provides data for costing, material usage tracking, and
     budgeting.
     3.9.5. All end items (aircraft, engines, exchangeables, etc.) managed on permanent control numbers
     shall have complete G005M BOMs built and maintained. All end items managed on temporary con-
     trol numbers shall have temporary BOMs built in G004L. The only exception is for classified material
     as stated in paragraph 3.8.2.
     3.9.6. Occurrence factors for bills of material containing multiple operation numbers shall be vali-
     dated and adjusted on a quarterly basis. When available, the occurrence factor from G097, Pro-
     grammed Depot Maintenance Scheduling System (PDMSS) will be used. This is necessary to retain
     replacement factors in G005M. Replacement factors will be dropped when the PAQ is reached and
     automatic replacement analysis is performed. G005M uses the following formula to determine
     replacement rate:
     Replacement Rate = [issue history quantity/(units per assembly * production history * occurrence
     rate)] + 0.0049.

NOTES:
Issue history quantity = issues + current quarter backorders.
Production history quantity = production + other (other is inductions minus completions).

Section 3D—Interchangeability and Substitutability (I&S) Relations

3.10. I&S Terms Explained.
     3.10.1. Inherent Characteristics. There are physical and functional qualities which describe the
     intended use, operating conditions, tolerance and range, purpose and capability of an item and which
     are considered inherent to an item. I&S determination is critical to effective BOM development/main-
     tenance and to maximize parts supportability.
        3.10.1.1. Interchangeable Item. When two or more items possess such qualitative, functional, and
        physical characteristics as to be equal in performance and durability and capable of being
        exchanged one for the other without alteration of the items themselves or of adjoining items
        except for adjustment, and without selection for fit or performance, the items are considered inter-
        changeable.
            3.10.1.1.1. Under this explanation, the term interchangeable item may be applied to the same
            item of production and to different items of production that meet the requirements.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                               99


         3.10.1.1.2. Normally, the same item of production is considered to be an interchangeable item
         since it is identified and produced under the same manufacturer's part number. However, when
         such items are subjected to grading processes, which establish marked differences that are sig-
         nificant, and a necessary requisite to the intended use of the item, such items are not consid-
         ered interchangeable.
     3.10.1.2. Substitute Item. When two or more items possess such qualitative functional and physi-
     cal marks as to be capable of being exchanged only under certain conditions or in a particular
     application and without alteration of the items themselves, or adjoining items, they are substitute
     items. One-way interchangeability may be explained as Item B can be exchanged in all applica-
     tions for Item A, but Item A cannot be used in all applications requiring Item B. Under this expla-
     nation, substitute items fall into two subcategories; i.e., suitable substitutes and limited substitutes.
         3.10.1.2.1. Suitable Substitutes. Items possessing a one-way exchange capability are identi-
         fied as substitutes since they can be issued or used in place of other older items or those with
         less performance capability.
         3.10.1.2.2. Limited Substitutes. Items that cannot always be used in place of another item are
         considered limited substitutes. In the construction of groups and subgroups under I&S group-
         ing, limited substitutes will never be coded for automatic issue. Limited substitutes will be
         offered for issue, subject to acceptance by the customer submitting the requisition.
     3.10.1.3. Unsuitable Item. An item that for one or more reasons is no longer required, subject to
     general issue, nor meets the qualitative requirements of the Air Force. Normally unsuitable items
     are items designated as inactive, disposal, condemned, etc., through stock list change (SLC)
     action. However, items having an active source of supply may also be categorized as unsuitable to
     restrict their issue and use. Examples of such items include time compliance technical order
     (TCTO) items and the Security Assistance Program (SAP).
  3.10.2. I&S Group. A grouping of items that possess such physical and functional characteristics as
  to provide comparable functional performance for a given requirement. Such items are identified as
  interchangeable or substitutes and are arranged in descending order to the item preferred most for
  retention in the inventory. The D035K process assigns codes to items within the I & S group and
  codes to items not in a group. Some of these codes are shown below, and carry the same meaning in
  G005M as well as D035K.
     3.10.2.1. A or L—Bachelor Item. Item not in an I&S group.
     3.10.2.2. D—Interchangeable item.
     3.10.2.3. B—One subgroup only in the I & S group and this item is the master.
     3.10.2.4. C—More than one subgroup in the I & S group and this item is the subgroup primary
     item.
  3.10.3. Group Description. A brief description is prepared for each I&S group and will consist of the
  item name and modifier. This may include the part number, type number, or application.
  3.10.4. Subgroup (SG). A group of interchangeable items within an I&S group. All items in any sub-
  group must be interchangeable and assigned the same subgroup code. NOTE: If the second letter of
  the sub-group is different from the first letter, then the items are not 2-way interchangeable.
100                                                                AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


      3.10.5. Parts Preference (PP) Codes. A one-digit code that identifies the relationship of each item
      within a subgroup and indicates the order of use in supplying the items.
      3.10.6. Order of Use (OOU) or Order of Preference Codes. The order of preference is established in
      each subgroup to accommodate management decisions and to establish an order of use capable of both
      manual and computer interpretations. The OOU code consists of a three-position alphabetic code con-
      structed from the two-position SG code and the one position PP code, to indicate the sequence in
      which items may be automatically supplied. For example, AA + A = AAA. Up to three, three-digit
      OOU codes may apply to a given described item.
      3.10.7. Master Item. The item determined by research to be most desirable and satisfactory in meet-
      ing a specific Air Force requirement, to be available, authorized for purchase, and suitable for use in
      place of any other item within the I&S group. Only one master item will be assigned for each I&S
      group, and is always the last item in the last SG in an I&S group.
      3.10.8. Described Item. This is a general item used in reference to a line item in an I&S group.
      3.10.9. Primary Item. The item most desired for retention within a SG. When the primary item and
      the master item are the same, the term master item will be applied.
      3.10.10. Secondary Item. An item within an I&S group having a lower subgroup assignment than the
      primary item. For example, in an I&S group made up of SGs AA, AB, and AC, items in SGs AA and
      AB are secondary items.
      3.10.11. Incompatible I&S Group. A group wherein the required uniformity in management data
      assignments has been established. For example, certain codes are not compatible; e.g., the acquisition
      advice code (AAC), the unit of issue (U/I), the material management aggregation code (MMAC), and
      expendability (ERRC) codes, etc.

3.11. I & S Principles. The items of supply in an I&S group contain various degrees of exchange capa-
bility. For example, the following principles apply:
      3.11.1. Fully interchangeable.
      3.11.2. Substitutable when one can substitute for another.
      3.11.3. One replacing many.
      3.11.4. A combination.

3.12. Coding. The coding within the I&S group explains the relationships between all items in the group
and their order of use or OOU.
      3.12.1. Always work down in the I&S group from the least preferred to the most preferred or master
      item. The master item must be a good substitute for all the other items in the group.
      3.12.2. SGs may contain one or more items. All items in the same SG are interchangeable. The first
      item in a SG is the first order of use for each item in the same SG. Always use the first item in the SG
      first.
      3.12.3. An I&S family consists of items that are interchangeable, suitable substitutes, and limited
      substitute items. Generally, all items in a SG are interchangeable, because they perform the same
      functions within the same limits, and are nearly identical.
AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007                                                                            101


       3.12.3.1. SGs within the family will contain substitute items. One particular SG will be inter-
       changeable with all other SGs within the family and this SG will contain the family master item.
       The master item and all items in its SGs are freely interchangeable with all other items in the fam-
       ily.
       3.12.3.2. The master item has been identified as the item which best meets the needs of the Air
       Force and is therefore, most desirable for retention in the Air Force inventory.
   3.12.4. Each SG is identified by a two-position alphabetical code. Each member of the SG will have
   this two-position code. SG AA will be the least desirable SG for retention in the Air Force inventory.
   SG AB would be the next least desirable, etc. The SG with the highest SG code in the family will con-
   tain the family master. For example, for a family with three SGs, the master item will be in SG AC.
       3.12.4.1. Each item within a SG will be assigned a PP code. This single position code identifies
       the desirability of retention of that item within the SG.
       3.12.4.2. Each item within the SG is assigned an OOU code. This three-position code is the SG
       and PP code of the next item to be used. An item that is not suitable as a substitute item will be
       assigned a numeric PP code and will never be used as part of the OOU code.

3.13. Systems. The I & S groupings used in the D035K system are used to align usage to a component
item standard in the G005M Material Control System. When new items are catalogued, the engineering
specifications are reviewed and the item is assigned to an I&S family. When an item is requisitioned, the
D035K system attempts to fill the exact NSN requisitioned first. If the requisitioned item is not available,
the D035K then checks within the subgroup of the item for the least preferred item and tracks through all
suitable substitute items to the family master until the requisition can be filled.
   3.13.1. If the requisitioned item is the least preferred item in the family or a member of the SG con-
   taining the least preferred item, then OOU codes will allow D035K to track through all suitable sub-
   stitute items to the family master, attempting issue on each item until the requisition can be filled.
   3.13.2. If the requisitioned item is the family master, or an item within the same SG as the family
   master, D035K can only track this one SG.

3.14. I & S General Procedures.
   3.14.1. When establishing a BOM in G005M, the least preferred item on I&S linkage that will
   accomplish the mission should be used. This will provide the greatest use of all materials.
   3.14.2. In computing analysis of maintenance material usage in the G005M, all material issued from
   an I&S family for a given production number will be consolidated with the issues for the item on
   which the material standard is established.
   3.14.3. G005M contains the complete I&S linkage and order of issue codes. When researching a
   stock number or adding a new component item, it is possible to interrogate the database and get the
   total I&S family displayed on the remote terminal. All stock numbers contained in the family will be
   included when a family member resides as an item in G005M. This will assist engineering planning in
   identifying the stock number that will give the most material support to the workload. If the stock
   number is the family master, the total I&S family will be displayed with I&S linkage and OOU codes.
   If the stock number is not the family master, only the family master stock number will be displayed.

             GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION

Terms
NOTE: It must be recognized that the same terms may have different meanings in other areas of Air
Force activity.
Accountability—The degree of responsibility for material that has been recorded. This material is then
subject to inventory or audit.
Action Code—A manually assigned or machine generated two-position alpha code that provides a status
of the action taken on the request.
Advice Code—A code used by the requestor that tells the source of supply how to fill the requisition. The
code assigned should provide sufficient information to the item manager for making a decision on how to
support/fill the requirement. The accurate assignment of the code will preclude unnecessary delays in the
shipment of needed assets.
Aircraft Logistics Specialist (ALS)—A standard aircraft repair position in the WSSC/EPSC. The ALS
is a member of the aircraft tail team and focuses on tail number scheduling. Among their many duties are
to open and close JONs, process engineering, and cannibalization requests, and resolve unpredictable
requirements. The ALS joins the aircraft upon arrival and accompanies through Post-Dock. Refer to
AFMCI 21-129 and 21-133.
AIR LOGISTIC CENTER (ALC)—An AFMC depot operational activity charged with organically
accomplishing repair and modification tasks; contracting with industry for manufacture or repair, as
directed by the System Program Manager (SPM) and/or Materiel Manager (MM) for assigned weapon
systems, equipment or items of supply; and providing worldwide technical and logistics support for Air
Force operational units, Other Services/Agencies, and foreign military customers.
Automated Bill Of Material (ABOM)—ABOM utilizes a relational database management system with
real-time teleprocessing capabilities and on-line interface with NIMMS. All material requests are made
through ABOM. ABOM edits the request against the G005M Bill of Material (BOM) for permanent work
and G004L Bill of Material for non-programmed work (M-Jobs and T-Jobs). The material must be tied to
the operation number it is consumed on. The request is then passed from ABOM to NIMMS for additional
validation and processing.
Backorder—Material that is not available for issue (same as a due-out). It is a D035K computer-recorded
obligation to issue the material at a subsequent date when it becomes available.
Bench Stock Items—N and P ERRC coded indirect consumption material items authorized for free
access in a production shop area to ensure an uninterrupted work flow.
Bill Of Material (BOM)—A descriptive and quantitative listing of components required to manufacture,
overhaul, or repair a designated end item, assembly, or subassembly.
Bulk Material—Material stored and issued by volume, footage, weight, or liquid measurement, such as
petroleum, bar stock, and lumber.
104                                                              AFMCI21-130 15 NOVEMBER 2007


Commercial And Government Entity (CAGE) Code—The CAGE Code is a five position code that
identifies Federal Government Organizations, contractors doing business with the Federal Government,
NATO member nations, and other foreign governments.
Cannibalization—Removing an assembly, subassembly, component, or part from an end item by a
maintenance activity for use on an end item undergoing depot repair. The end item that will be canned of
component part(s) may be drawn from the warehouse, or from items currently in work in the shop. The
appropriate supply chain manager/prime Materiel Manager, and/or SPO/SPD must authorize and pay for
this action. DMAG is not authorized to conduct cannibalizations without the proper authorizations and
payments.
Carcass Cost—The value of an asset when the Latest Repair Cost and Center Direct/Indirect Allocable
Cost Recovery plus General and Administrative Cost Recovery at the Latest Acquisition Cost have been
removed from the Standard Price of the item.
Center Direct/Indirect Cost Recovery At Latest Acquisition Cost—The portion of the cost recovery
element that the Air Logistics Centers can influence as applied to the Latest Acquisition Cost. Center
Direct/Indirect Cost Recovery are expenses developed by the wholesale group with input from the
Inventory Control Point. They are supply operations costs, DLA receipt costs, second destination
transportation costs, and depreciation (capital investment) costs.
Center Direct/Indirect Cost Recovery At Latest Repair Cost—The portion of the cost recovery
element that the Air Logistics Centers can influence as applied to the Latest Repair Cost. Center Direct/
Indirect Cost Recovery are expenses developed by the wholesale division with input from the Inventory
Control Point. They are supply operations costs, DLA receipt costs, second destination transportation
costs, and depreciation (capital investment) costs.
Centrally Procured (CP)—Stock listed items supplied through one central agency, i.e., the Materiel
Support Division (MSD), Air Force Stock Fund (AFSF), using fund code 64, and budget code 8 with a CP
procurement code.
Common Item—An item of supply having application to two or more systems or subsystems, including
components and spares.
Component Item—Material, usually stock numbered, which is an identifiable entity contained in the
next level of assembly. A component item may be an end item.
Contingency—An alternate plan of operation put in use when a system computer is inoperative.
Operations under a contingency plan will begin only at the direction of the system office of primary
responsibility.
Contractor Acquired Property (CAP)—The depot maintenance organic capability to obtain parts not
available in the normal supply system to meet production requirements. Unlike local purchase procedures
conducted using stock funds. CAP authorizes the use of DMAG funds.
Controlled Area—Any specifically designated building, area, or structure-containing resources, which
are lucrative targets for theft, compromise, or destruction, and to which entry, must be limited in order to
provide more than routine protection.
Controlled Exception—A transaction that contains a document number that fails to pass computer edits.
A serial number is assigned by the computer to this type of exception to permit computer control until

Depot Maintenance Accounting and Production System (DMAPS).—DMAPS is a suite of systems
supporting organic depot maintenance for the Air Force, implemented at OO-ALC (Ogden Air Logistics
Center), WR-ALC (Warner Robins ALC), and OC-ALC (Oklahoma City ALC) and DFAS (Defense
Finance and Accounting Service) organizations that support the ALCs. The suite provides AFMC the
capability to capture actual and planned direct labor and direct material at the task level and report this on
a daily basis. Overhead and G&A (General and Administrative) costs will be applied on a planned dollar
rate per direct labor hour instead of actual overhead and G&A being calculated and allocated at the end of
the month. This will give DMAG (Depot Maintenance Activity Group) the ability to view production
costs (direct labor, direct material, applied overhead & G&A) at the task level on a daily basis.
Depot Maintenance Activity Group (DMAG)—The AFMC depot maintenance function is financed by
the DMAG formerly called the Depot Maintenance Business Area (DMBA) of the Defense Working

material will become a part of the end item or other item which is undergoing maintenance, or it may be
consumed in the maintenance production process (e.g., heat treating, plating, or painting) when the
consumed material is peculiar to the item produced. Items that must be classified as direct material
include serial number controlled, exchange, TO kit, organic manufacture, those classified as direct
material in the same cost center, and those considered peculiar, critical, or which require increased
control. Although the G005M will attempt to set cost codes and material classification codes based on
default logic, the planner/material planners has ultimate responsibility to ensure the G005M reflects
reality and make changes where needed.

Planning BOMS—Also, know as P-BOMs. Planning BOMs are built by the planner in the initial stages
of planning for a new workload. They are static in that they are not analyzed and updated by the G005M
system. Normally, P-BOMs are canceled once the workload is in place and production has begun. At this
time, the production BOM is in place and is analyzed and updated automatically by the G005M to reflect
actual usage of component parts. Planning BOMs may also be used for forecasting of consumable
material requirements using RFM when a static BOM is required. In this case, both the P-BOM and the
production BOM would co-exist in G005M.
Planned Material—Indicates that material is planned by NSN, units per assembly (UPA), and
replacement percent on a maintenance BOM.

uninterrupted and or demand remains constant.
Sensitive Item—Material that requires a high degree of protection and control due to statutory
requirements or regulations. (See AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part One).
Shop Service Center (SSC)/Exchangeable Products Support Center (EPSC)—The SSC/EPSC is the
standard materiel support function for DREP shops in AFMC. The SSC/EPSC is an aggregate of
functional components involved in providing materiel to the Fixer, acting as a trouble shooter for solving
parts problems, or if possible, preventing them. It also serves as a mini-supply storage area located in or
near the Fixer's work area. Frequently used materiel is physically located as close to the Fixer as practical.
This material is owned and managed by a depot supply account. Unserviceable end items (Consolidated
Repair Inventory (CRI)) are also pre-positioned to expedite repair. This materiel will be stored in the
SSC/EPSC based on need and available storage space. New SSC/EPSCs based on the requirements of the
Fixer, will be established after negotiations with the Fixer. During negotiations, the Fixer and SSC/EPSC

Chief will decide NSNs to be stored, levels required, and the size of the CRI. All actions are performed to
provide comprehensive and effective support in the form of materiel planning, production scheduling,
work-loading, retail item management, item research, order placement, materiel storage, inventory, and
distribution, local procurement, process analysis, and other key materiel related processes.
Source Of Supply (SOS)—The agency to which requisitions are sent for supply action.
Special Level—A manually assigned stock level. The minimum or maximum quantity required to be on
hand or on order for specific purposes.
Special Purpose Recoverables Authorized Maintenance (SPRAM)—A n S B S S c o m p u t e r d e t a i l
record denoting certain ERRC designator P and T test equipment items IAW AFMAN 23-110, Volume II,
Part Two, USAF Supply Manual.
Standard Depot Maintenance Process (SDMP)—SDMP is the standardized AFMC repair process used
for all depot level maintenance. The key tenets of AREP are: Standardized repair process, focus on
throughput, supply support (WSSC/SSC/EPSC) on the shop floor, standardized functions, defined roles
and responsibilities, alignment of responsibility/authority of key players, standardized data systems, and
customer driven performance measures.
Standard Price—The price customers are charged which, for DoD Inventory Control Point managed
items (excluding subsistence), remains constant throughout a fiscal year except for the correction of
significant errors. This price includes the Latest Acquisition Cost plus the General and Administrative
Overhead Cost Recovery at Latest Acquisition Cost and Center Direct/Indirect Allocable Cost Recovery
at Latest Acquisition Cost. A Standard Price is computed for each Air Force-managed RSD I&S subgroup
master NSN. This same price is applied to all NSNs in that subgroup. If the subgroup is two-way
interchangeable, it could have a different price than the family master.
Standard Reporting Designator (SRD)—Required for all DM material issue and backorder
requisitions. Workload Managers will input SRD code on all ABOM/NIMMS D7X transactions. The
SRD code is developed by base level maintenance via the Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 350
card. This card is attached to the material and stays with the material until removed by DM personnel. The
SRD entry will greatly improve bit/piece subassembly supportability to maintenance by linking these
parts to a specific end item or system. The SRD converts to a Weapon System Designator Code that DLA
uses in its buy policy for depot support.
Status Code—A series of codes used for transmitting the status from the material manager or source of
supply to the requisitioner.
Stock Fund—A stock fund is a revolving fund established to finance inventories of supplies and other
stores. It is authorized by specific provision of law to finance a continuing cycle of operations. Receipts
derived from maintenance operations are then available for further use.
Stock Level—A computer requirement for stockage of an item of supply.
Stock List Change (SLC)—Used to correct or update elements of management data on material system
records.
Suffix Code—Purpose of the suffix code on a supply transaction is to relate and identify requisitions for
partial quantities to the original requisition.
Suitable Substitute—An item that meets or exceeds the original items requirements for form, fit,
function, etc.

Time Change Item—These are components of weapon systems which have been identified as having
some fixed service life expectancy, and which must be replaced with a new or overhauled item after
accrual of a specified number of hours or cycles of operation, or at the expiration of a given calendar time
period.
Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO)—An authorized directive issued to provide instructions to
Air Force activities for accomplishing one-time changes, modifications, inspection of equipment, or
installation of new equipment within a given timeframe.
Turn-In—A transaction whereby property is moved from the maintenance production line to supply.
Type, Model, Series (TMS)—A combination of alpha characters and numbers used to identify a specific
engine by type, model, and series. The first alpha designator identifies the type of engine as turbojet,
turbofan, turboprop, etc. The first numeric designator identifies the engine model. The second alpha
designator indicates the engine manufacturer and the second numeric designator identifies the series. The
series is used to identify a particular configuration of a given engine model (ex: J57-P-29).

                      LOCAL ISSUE DOCUMENT (AFMC FORM 95)

Table A4.1. AFMC Form Instruction Table.
Block   Column   Description
1       1-3      Document Identifier, a three-position alphanumeric code that acts as an action
                 and financial accounting indicator. Each transaction must contain a document
                 identifier code. Entry in field one will always be D. Entry in field two will be
                 either alpha or numerical:
                   a. An alpha entry field two denotes management action that does not affect
                 the D035K accountable balance record. Code G in this position indicates a
                 backorder is to be adjusted. The G is computer assigned when an item is
                 backordered and will be manually assigned by MXG personnel when the
                 backorder is to be cancelled.
                   b. A numeric entry in field two indicates that the transaction will affect the
                 D035K accountable balance. A 7 in this position indicates a request for issue;
                 a 6 indicates the turn-in to supply by the MXG. The third position entry, an
                 alpha code, is related to the Type Transaction code. Normally, this code is left
                 blank for mechanical assignment based on the Cost Code and Job Designator.
                 The MXG personnel always will make an entry in this block for backorder
                 cancellation.
2       4-6      Routing Identifier, this is a three-position alpha designator that indicates the
                 source of supply to which the transaction will be transmitted. All request
                 transactions submitted will reflect the appropriate WSSC/SSC/EPSC routing
                 designator. All MXG turn-in transactions, other than turn-ins to the WSSC/
                 SSC/EPSC or turn-ins from the WSSC/SSC/EPSC to depot supply, will
                 contain the local distribution routing identifier.
3       7        Type Transaction Code, a one-position alpha code that is normally
                 mechanically assigned on MXG issue and turn-in transactions. Manual
                 assignment will be required when requisitioning or turning in non-EAID
                 equipment (Type Transaction code N), or floating stock items (Type
                 Transaction code F). This code is used to relate and identify category of items
                 or customers.
4       8-22     Stock Number, enter the stock number of the item being requested or turned
                 in.
5       23-24    Unit of Issue, enter the physical measurement, count, or when neither is
                 applicable, that element of data to which the unit price is ascribed.
6       25-29    Quantity, enter the number of units of issue involved in the transaction.

                 organically manufactured material for WSSC/SSC/EPSC.
8       44       Demand Suffix. A single-digit alpha code designating the item as being
                 applicable to initial installation, a nonrecurring requirement, a recurring
                 requirement, or a nonrecurring maintenance programmed, planned, or
                 projected requirement. Demand codes will be assigned according to
                 Attachment 7. When condemned items are being turned in, a disposal
                 authority code of either an H (for directed condemnation and will reflect the
                 TO number) or a T (for condition condemned in inspection and supported by
                 the inspection number) will be entered in this field.
9       45-50    Building or Station Number, the first four positions of this code are provided
                 for use, as locally directed, to indicate the building location (by number) to
                 which the material is to be delivered. The last two positions are to be used to
                 indicate the point in the building to which the material will be delivered to the
                 MXG personnel.

                 which the first five positions are used for the end item control number; the last
                 position is used for the one-position alpha job designator. Requisitions for
                 indirect production material, shop operating material, and office supplies will
                 carry X56326100000, X56336300000 and X56366400000, respectively.
                 Enter X56406800000 for defective work and spoilage. Leave blank on

                 provided at ALC level. These codes will be assigned (when applicable) to
                 work being accomplished by a MXG. Otherwise, leave blank.
12      60       Urgency of Need Designator (UND), an alpha character used to signify the
                 degree of urgency or conditions that cause the initiation of the request. This
                 block should show UND on a request for issue (see Attachment 8). Credit
                 indicator, if appropriate, is entered on turn-ins. Enter X for organically
                 manufactured turn-ins to show the item is for serviceable operating stock.
13      61       Force Activity Designator (FAD). A numeric entry used to signify relative
                 importance of user activities. This block should not be blank on a request (see
                 Attachment 9). If requesting organization is servicing another activity, the
                 higher of the two FADs may be used. No entry required for turn-ins.
14      62-64    JON Suffix. Enter the suffix that applies to the appropriate job order. Leave
                 blank when a job order is not required.

                                          DEMAND CODES
NOTE: (A complete list of demand codes may be found in AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Three. This
attachment is to be used as supplemental guidance only).

Table A6.1. Demand Codes.
Code    Description
A       Initial Installation (Nonrecurring):
          a. Request for serviceable replacements for recoverable components missing from items
        received in an incomplete status or replacement for turn-in of dissimilar or obsolete
        recoverable items.
         b. Request for serviceable replacements for recoverable components missing from repair
        cycle items, holes in aircraft, initial issue of new requirements, or increased requirements.
         c. Turn-in of exchange items that are removed and not replaced by exchange items.
          d. Turn-in of excess recoverable components received on unserviceable end items or
        serviceable items excess to requirements.
          e. Turn-in of dissimilar or obsolete recoverable items that were replaced with dissimilar
        items.
         f. Turn-in of recoverable material resulting from organizational deactivation.
N       Nonrecurring:
          a. Request for one-time requirement (unplanned program), loan, assembly, and floating
        stock.
          b. Request for spares and spare parts for modification of equipment, special, planned
        programs, and one-time repair or rebuild requirements, non-EAID equipment (includes
        initial build-up of test sets and similar equipment).
         c. Turn-in of components from reclamation of disassembly.
P       Special Program Requirements (Nonrecurring): This code is used to indicate that the
        request is for material previously forecast as a Special Program Requirement (SPR).
        Detailed guidance on the use of SPRs is contained in AFMAN 23-110, Volume 1, Part
        One.
R       Recurring:
          a. Request for material (spares, spare parts or supplies) made periodically or anticipated
        to be repetitive for consumption or for stock replenishment.
          b. The R demand code represents both programmed and non-programmed requirements,
        which, due to the nature of the work, will be requested again in the near future. Therefore,
        a MXG request with an R demand code is processed as a recurring transaction and will
        establish a distribution level that will be adjusted accordingly based on future R demand
        coded requests.

                                               Attachment 7

                             URGENCY OF NEED DESIGNATOR (UND)

A7.1. The initial request for serviceable direct or indirect material with UND A or B must have advice
code 2C or 2J, as appropriate, entered in advice code field or blank.

Table A7.1. UND Codes.
Designator      Conditions
A               (1). Cannot perform mission.
                (2). An existing production line stoppage.
B               (1). Mission capability is impaired.
                (2). An anticipated production line stoppage.
C               (1). All other requirements.
                (2). Routine requests.

NOTE: (The prescribing regulation for UND and FAD codes is AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 1, Part One.
Please refer to that source for official guidance. Additional guidance may be found in AFMAN 23-110,
Vol. 3, Part Two. This attachment is provided as supplemental guidance only and is not intended to
replace policy/guidance contained in AFMAN 23-110).
    A7.1.1. If the demand cannot be met from available assets; distribution will provide a status card to
    the MXG with advice code CO, signifying rejection of the unfilled quantity.
    A7.1.2. Upon receipt of a status card indicating partial or full cancellation of the original request, the
    originator will review the requirement to determine if a priority requisition should be forwarded off
    base for the unfilled quantity. If so, the requestor will have the requirement certified by the mainte-
    nance production group chief or designated representative and resubmit his request omitting advice
    code 2C or 2J. If not, the request will be resubmitted using UND C.
    A7.1.3. Justification for high priority requests and evidence of certification as applicable will be
    maintained according to standard procedures.
    A7.1.4. When certification by the production group chief or designated representative is obtained
    prior to submitting an initial request; it will not be necessary to use advice code 2C or 2J.

A7.2. The MXG will conduct a review of high priority requisitions to ensure intent of the UND is not
abused.

A7.3. When FAD I or II is entered in the request; a Z override code must be placed in the management
field to prevent rejection of the requisition.

NOTE: (The prescribing regulation for FAD and UND codes is AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 1, Part One. Addi-
tional guidance may be found in AFMAN 23-110, Vol. 3, Part Two. This attachment is provided as sup-
plemental guidance only and is not intended to replace policy/guidance contained in AFMAN 23-110).
      A8.1.1. The FAD of the using activity may be used when maintenance is accomplished in direct sup-
      port of the using organization (area support) or when using activity will suffer reduced mission capa-
      bility because the MXG will not meet delivery commitments to the user (slippage of aircraft and
      missile schedule).
      A8.1.2. Work stoppage material requests should, where possible, relate to the FAD of the activity
      being supported. This should result in the use of a FAD II or I for demands to alleviate a work stop-
      page provided the requirements can be associated with a user with a lower number FAD (resulting in
      a higher priority) than FAD III.
      A8.1.3. Special projects may carry a FAD other than IV when so specified in programming docu-
      ments.

A8.2. The chief of the maintenance production group will stipulate in writing to his scheduling activities
when a FAD other than 3 is authorized for certain workloads and the duration of such authorization.

A8.3. Should the field be left blank on a material request document, designator FAD V will be mechani-
cally assigned. This block will be left blank on production requests, wash-post entries, and turn-in docu-
ments.
