Programming Plans (PPlan) for beddown actions requiring Programming Plan (PPlan) and/or Program
Task Force (PROTAF) actions. This supplement does not apply to Air Force Reserve Command nor Air
National Guard units. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of

1.2.2. The Directorate of Plans and Programs and Analyses, Plans and Programs Division, Bases and
Units Branch (HQ AFSPC/A8IB), is responsible for managing site survey requests, managing site
survey and Project Task Force (PROTAF) processes, leading site surveys and PROTAFs, and managing
the programming plans (PPlan) process (see AFI10-501_AFSPCSUP Program Action Directives (PAD)
and Programming Plans (PPlan)). Since most basing initiatives cross functional lines and require
coordinated staff action, AFSPC unit commanders and headquarters staff agencies will inform HQ
AFSPC/A8IB of planned mission changes or relocations affecting this command.
2.1. Site Survey Request Format. Contact HQ AFSPC/A8IB for all requests to relocate existing AFSPC
units, beddown new AFSPC units, or locate non-AFSPC units on AFSPC installations. Specific
procedures for intra-AFSPC and non-AFSPC requests are as follows:
2.1.3. (Added) Intra-AFSPC Requests:
2.1.3.1. (Added) Headquarters staff agencies will forward all intra-AFSPC site survey requests to HQ
AFSPC/A8IB (for e-mail use afspc.a8i.wf.ex@peterson.af.mil).

2.1.3.2. (Added) On receipt of a site survey request, HQ AFSPC/A8IB will initiate coordination to gain
approval for the survey. HQ AFSPC/A8IB is responsible for appropriate headquarters agencies being
included in the planning stage.
2.1.3.3. (Added) After the survey is approved, HQ AFSPC/A8IB will work with the requesting agency
to conduct the survey. HQ AFSPC/A8IB will provide the survey team chief, publish the survey report,
and coordinate any subsequent beddown requests according to paragraph 3. of the basic instruction.
2.1.4. (Added) Non-AFSPC Requests:
2.1.4.1. (Added) AFSPC units and headquarters staff agencies will forward requests from non-AFSPC
agencies to locate on, or for survey of, AFSPC installations to HQ AFSPC/A8IB. Requests should ntain
information shown in Attachment 5 (Added)

Prior to the site survey, the proposed gaining installation will review the information submitted by the
proponent in the unit beddown application (Attach 5) and identify siting alternatives which appear to
meet proponent requirements and are compatible with the base comprehensive plan. These alternatives
will be presented and evaluated during the site survey and siting recommendations will be documented
in the site survey report.
2.1.4.2. (Added) Unit commanders and headquarters agencies are not restricted from making contact
with non-AFSPC agencies as part of the survey planning process. AFSPC units hosting planning teams
will inform HQ AFSPC/A8IB of the planning visit results.
3.3.1. (Added) Beddown Planning. After beddown approval is received, HQ AFSPC/A8IB will
coordinate beddown planning to include programming plan (PPlan) preparation and program task force
(PROTAF) meetings as follows:
3.3.1.1. (Added) Programming Plans (PPlan). The AFSPC supplement to AFI 10-501 contains
information concerning AFSPC PPlan preparation.
3.3.1.2. (Added) Program Task Force (PROTAF):
3.3.1.2.1. (Added) A PROTAF will be established to identify the actions and tasks required to transfer,
beddown, and operate. The PROTAF is normally established prior to PPlan publication. The PROTAF
will produce a compilation of the tasks, OPRs, estimated completion dates, and pertinent comments that
will support building the PPlan. Additionally, the PROTAF will attempt to identify all costs associated
with the transfer, beddown, and operation of the program.
3.3.1.2.2. (Added) HQ AFSPC/A8IB will provide the AFSPC PROTAF team chief.
3.3.1.2.3. (Added) The PROTAF is composed of personnel from HQ AFSPC, other MAJCOMs, outside
agencies, and affected base-level agencies. The PROTAF may be subdivided into groups or teams with
designated team chiefs. The team chiefs will work with their teams and interact with other teams to
identify the action items and tasks that need to be done to achieve the goal of the PPlan. The AFSPC
supplement to AFI 10-501 contains additional information concerning PROTAFs.
