responsible Level III will plan, lead and direct procedure qualification activities in coordination
with the WR-ALC NDI Program Manager and the responsible SPO engineer.
   4.1. Phase 1: Procedure Validation. During validation the NDI technique is expected to
   progress from initial concept to a written draft procedure. Progress will occur predominantly
   through laboratory environment testing such as, software-modeling, open-specimen trials and
   prototype demonstrations. Validation concludes with successful procedure performance on
   simulated or actual components. The responsible Level III will present validation results to
4                                                     ROBINSAFBI21-120 5 JANUARY 2010


    the WR-ALC NDI Program Manager for endorsement prior to Phase 2 procedure
    verification.
       4.1.1. Procedure validation shall as a minimum accomplish the following objectives. The
       objectives are general in scope and are intended to guide the qualification process, not to
       dictate how results are obtained.
           4.1.1.1. Collect and analyze supporting data.
           4.1.1.2. Determine appropriate method, equipment and technique parameters.

           4.1.1.5. Determine component removal and surface preparation requirements as
           necessary.
           4.1.1.6. Design/manufacture test     specimens    containing   actual or     simulated
           discontinuities as necessary.
           4.1.1.7. Design/manufacture prototype support equipment as necessary.
           4.1.1.8. Produce a draft technical procedure.
           4.1.1.9. Conduct necessary tests and evaluations to demonstrate procedure feasibility
           to meet engineering expectations for detection capability (Reference EN-SB-08-012).
           4.1.1.10. Document validation per the appropriate Qualification Checklist.
           4.1.1.11. Approve the procedure for Phase 2.
    4.2. Phase 2: Procedure Verification. Verification activities normally include a combination
    of blind-specimen trials and formal procedure demonstrations in a production environment.
    The verification process must prove the suitability of an NDI procedure to perform its
    intended purpose to the satisfaction of the verification witnesses, the responsible Level III
    and the responsible SPO Engineer.
       4.2.1. Procedure Verification shall as a minimum accomplish the following objectives.
       The objectives are general in scope and are intended to guide the qualification process,
       not to dictate how results are obtained.
           4.2.1.1. Ensure the procedure is thorough, understandable and logically written.
           4.2.1.2. Ensure the procedure is understood and executable by the lowest
           certification-level technician anticipated to utilize the procedure in production.
           4.2.1.3. Ensure the specified equipment performs as expected and is readily available
           to the intended end-user.
           4.2.1.4. Ensure part, component and/or aircraft preparation requirements are
           adequate and can be accomplished as written.
           4.2.1.5. Demonstrate the procedure meets engineering expectations for detection
           capability (Reference Structures Bulletin EN-SB-08-012).
ROBINSAFBI21-120 5 JANUARY 2010                                                               5


        4.2.1.6. Assign Inspectability Factor and perform Capability Adjustments as
        applicable. (Reference Technical Report: AFRL-RX-WP-TM-2008-4373)
        4.2.1.7. Determine the need for specialized personnel training or certification.
        4.2.1.8. Estimate inspection process labor hours, including all preparation operations.
        4.2.1.9. Account for human factor and environmental variables as necessary.
        4.2.1.10. Document verification per the appropriate Qualification Checklist.
        4.2.1.11. Approve the procedure for publication, distribution and production use.
     4.2.2. Methods of Verification. The three methods of Procedure Verification are
     Performance, Simulation or Desk-top Analysis as defined below. Unless otherwise
     approved, Procedure Verification must be accomplished by Performance. The use of
     Simulation or Desk-top Analysis methods can result in the release of less than optimal
     procedures. Therefore, the use of these methods should be limited and requires the
     approval of both the WR-ALC NDI Program Manager and the responsible SPO Engineer.
     Justification and approvals for the Simulation or Desk-top analysis methods must be
     documented in writing by the responsible SPO engineer and filed with the procedure
     development records.
        4.2.2.1. Verification by Performance. Verification by Performance requires the
        written technical instructions to be successfully accomplished on a production
        configured aircraft or component in a maintenance environment.
            4.2.2.1.1. All NDI procedures associated with Flight Safety Critical Structure,
            critical application items and nuclear certified equipment must be Verified by
            Performance.
            4.2.2.1.2. Verification by Performance must be accomplished by the lowest NDI
            certification-level anticipated to perform the inspection in production.
            4.2.2.1.3. If required by the responsible SPO Engineer, Level III or WR-ALC
            NDI Program Manager, it may be necessary to determine procedure capability
            through Probability-of-Detection (PoD) experiments or capability studies. All
            PoD or capability test plans shall be approved by the WR-ALC NDI Program
            Manager prior to commencing with testing.
            4.2.2.1.4. Verification by Performance is the most rigorous and potentially the
            most costly verification method. Performance verifications often involve a
            combination of mechanic, technician and engineering man-hours and if not
            properly planned and scheduled, can result in production interruptions or delays.
            The responsible Level III and SPO Engineer must plan for performance
            verifications early in the qualification process to avoid production interruptions
            and extra costs.
        4.2.2.2. Verification by Simulation. Verification by Simulation is based upon first-
        hand, working knowledge of the production configured aircraft or component and the
        proposed NDI procedural requirements.
            4.2.2.2.1. Verification by Simulation may only be conducted if justified and
            approved by the responsible SPO Engineer and the WR-ALC NDI Program
6                                                   ROBINSAFBI21-120 5 JANUARY 2010


              Manager.
              4.2.2.2.2. Instances where Verification by Simulation may be justified include:
              1) revision of an existing qualified procedure to expand the area of interest, 2)
              implementation of an existing qualified procedure to similar structure elsewhere
              on the aircraft, 3) when valid PoD or capability data is available and can be
              directly correlated to the inspection requirements at hand, and 4) emergency
              circumstances where time-constraints do not permit Verification by Performance
              to be accomplished.
              4.2.2.2.3. Follow-up Verification by Performance shall always be considered
              when Verification by Simulation is utilized. If procedural deficiencies are
              discovered during the follow-up verification, the inspection shall be re-issued
              with necessary improvements.
           4.2.2.3. Verification by Desk Top Analysis. Verification by Desk-top Analysis is
           based solely on engineering assumptions gained through direct experience and
           comparison with similar procedural performance data.
              4.2.2.3.1. Verification by Desk-top Analysis is the least stringent method of
              verification and shall only be considered for use in extremely urgent or
              emergency situations.
              4.2.2.3.2. Verification by Desk-top Analysis may only be conducted if justified
              and approved by the responsible SPO Engineer and the WR-ALC NDI Program
              Manager.
              4.2.2.3.3. Follow-up Verification by Performance shall always be considered
              when Verification by Desk-top Analysis is utilized. If procedural deficiencies are
              discovered during the follow-up verification, the inspection shall be re-issued
              with necessary improvements.
    4.3. Method Specific Requirements. In addition to the general validation and verification
    requirements, each NDI method has specific areas of interest that must be addressed during
    qualification. Method specific requirements are identified by the appropriate Checklists in
    Attachments 2 through 6.
5. Reporting and Records Management.
    5.1. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are
    maintained in accordance with AFMAN 37-123, Management of Records, and are disposed
    of in accordance with Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS).
    5.2. When properly filled out and endorsed, the checklist serves as the primary procedure
    qualification data record. The checklist, a copy of the final procedure, and all supporting
    documentation (drawings, test results, etc) shall be permanently filed with the procedure
    development archives.
6. Prescribed and Adopted Forms.
    6.1. Prescribed Forms: No forms prescribed.
