                                           Chapter 1

                            PURPOSE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. Purpose. The purpose of the Combat Comptroller program is to provide trained Financial
Management personnel for wartime combat support and contingency operations. Combat
Comptroller is an Air Force, major command (MAJCOM), Field Operating Agency (FOA),
Direct Reporting Unit (DRU) and base-level readiness program to organize, train, and equip
Financial Management combat support forces (active duty, Air National Guard, and Air Force
Reserve) for both their wartime and contingency missions.
1.2. Information on Global Force Management (GFM) and AEF implementation,
processes, and procedures: contained within this instruction are for informational purposes
only. The source documents for Air Force support to GFM and AEF guidance are AFPD 10-4,
and AFI 10-401. The source document for AF deployment planning and execution is AFI 10-
403, Deployment Planning and Execution. AFPD 10-4 and AFI 10-401 prescribe and explain
how the Air Force participates in the Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC),
including force presentation and Deliberate and Crisis Action Planning and Execution Segment
(DCAPES), for the planning, deployment, employment, sustainment, redeployment and
reconstitution of forces. AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, implements AFPD
10-4 and AFI 10-401 by providing the basic requirements for Air Force deployment planning
and execution at all levels of command to support contingency and exercise deployment
operations.
1.3. FM Contingency Publications. A series of documents under the Combat Comptroller
program describe the FM role during contingency operations. These publications are fully
integrated to provide a complete understanding of how FM personnel will plan, administer, train,
and operate in an emergency or other contingency operation. This instruction describes the roles
and responsibilities of FM personnel at all levels and the administration of the Combat
Comptroller Program. It supports the concepts in the other documents as described below.
     1.3.1. FM Doctrine. Doctrine is a statement of officially sanctioned fundamental beliefs and
     warfighting principles that describe the proper use of FM forces in any type of military
     operation. Doctrine is authoritative, but requires judgment in application. These are the
     fundamental elements which offer broad guidance on how to operate. While technology and
     processes will change, these principles tend to hold true over the long run. FM doctrine is
     based on AFDD 4.0, Combat Support.
     1.3.2. FM Concepts of Operations (CONOPS). CONOPS is a statement that clearly and
     concisely expresses what the joint force commander intends to accomplish and how it will be
     done using available resources. The concept is designed to give an overall picture of the
     operation. The CONOPS is visionary and forward looking in nature. It offers details on how
     the organization will operate, as well as the desired outcomes. In broad terms, CONOPS
     describe the integration of capabilities (inputs) and processes to achieve desired effects
     (outputs). CONOPS describes the FM contribution to Agile Combat Support (ACS) and
     each of these is described in terms of value created by FM for the warfighter. FM CONOPS
     is published as a Functional Area Annex to the ACS CONOPS and may be found at the ACS
     CONOPS sharepoint site.

   1.3.3. This publication describes the roles and responsibilities of FM personnel in planning
   for and executing any contingency operation.

                                  FORCE PRESENTATION

2.1. Force presentation. Financial Management forces are presented to the commander as a
means to achieve desired financial outcomes on the battlefield or during a contingency.
Financial capabilities are provided to support the personnel and equipment needs of the
commander, and to enable him/her to accomplish the mission.
2.2. FM Capabilities. Financial Management core functional capabilities presented to
combatant commanders are described in the FM CONOPS.
2.3. Unit Type Codes. Financial Management forces are identified on standard Air Force UTC.
Each UTCs capability is described in the UTCs MISCAP statement. Financial Management
UTCs are included in the MEFPAK system under the alphanumeric series XFFA*. Mission
capability statements and manpower force element listings for each UTC are contained in the
MANFOR of the MEFPAK system. A LOGDET UTC is maintained in the Logistics Force
Packaging System (LOGFOR).
2.4. Force Modules. Financial Management UTCs are fully integrated into the Air and Space
Expeditionary Task Force (AETF) Force Module concept. Force modules are a combination of
standard, functionally aligned, UTCs combined to create a specific capability. These are
described in the FM CONOPS.
2.5. Reachback Activities. Reachback encompasses the network that transfers information and
support regarding requirements from areas of available capability to areas of needed capability.
Through reachback, deployed units obtain support from theater, rear, or CONUS-based
organizations. Reachback includes requests for supplies and equipment as well as specialty
consultation and decision support to enable mission accomplishment. With technological
advances and the stated goal of reducing the footprint in theater, many financial services shall be
provided via reachback. Refer to the FM CONOPS for more detailed information.

                                           Chapter 3

              OBJECTIVES, SCOPE, PLANNING, AND UTC POSTURING

3.1. Objectives. The Combat Comptroller program is designed to:
   3.1.1. Organize, train, and equip Financial Management forces that can deploy with decision
   support capabilities quickly to provide disbursing support, financial analysis and accounting,
   financial and cost services in support of world-wide contingency operations.
   3.1.2. Develop and maintain a highly skilled in-place force of civilians and Individual
   Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs) to support home station requirements as prescribed in both
   the Air Force and Financial Management doctrine and CONOPS.
   3.1.3. Maintain highly skilled Air Reserve Component (ARC) Financial Management forces
   to augment active duty forces during wartime operations and peacetime contingencies.
3.2. Scope. Combat Comptroller includes all military personnel in AFSCs 65XX and 6F0XX
and certain key and emergency-essential civilian personnel for wartime/contingency or in-place,
home station support at CONUS or overseas locations.
3.3. Adaptive Planning. Financial Management readiness planners assigned to air component
commands are required to develop appendices to OPLANs and CONPLANs and to determine
and place UTC requirements into associated OPLAN and CONPLAN TPFDDs using standard
UTCs. Planners use the standardized process for input into the TPFDD.
   3.3.1. The supported command FAM.
       3.3.1.1. Determines UTC requirements for his/her portion of the OPLAN or CONPLAN.
       3.3.1.2. Sources requirements only from his/her command assets to the extent he/she
       deems necessary and reasonable, based on UTC availability in the UTA.
   3.3.2. AFPC/DPW sources all remaining unfilled requirements from UTCs postured in the
   UTA. Under adaptive planning, these UTCs are periodically reviewed and resourced.
   3.3.3. The AFPC/DPW nominates UTC sourcing to the supporting MAJCOMs.
   3.3.4. MAJCOMs guide bases on developing deployment, force reception, beddown, and
   redeployment plans to meet their Combat Comptroller mission.
3.4. Crisis Action Planning. One of the two types of joint operation planning. The Joint
Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) process involving the time-sensitive
development of joint OPLANS and operation orders (OPORD) for the deployment, employment,
and sustainment of assigned and allocated forces and resources in response to an imminent crisis.
Crisis action planning is based on the actual circumstances that exist at the time planning occurs
(ref JP1-02, DoD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms).
   3.4.1. Component FM planners develop crisis action plan requirements.
   3.4.2. The AFPC/DPW nominates UTCs to respective MAJCOMs to support Component
   UTC requirements. Supported MAJCOMs source requirements first from their own assets.
   Once the MAJCOM has sourced the maximum number of UTCs they can, taking into
 14                                                              AFI10-213 26 FEBUARY 2014


   consideration home station requirements to support deploying and employing forces,
   AFPC/DPW nominates UTCs to fill requirements from other commands.
3.5. Base Level Planning. An understanding of MAJCOM and component plans is necessary to
develop base and unit plans. Comptroller units develop base support plan/expeditionary site
plan, disaster preparedness plans, non-combatant evacuation plans, financial annexes of support
agreements, and memorandums of understanding and agreement. Base level planning also
includes all local plans, checklists, and Comptroller Unit Control Center operations.
   3.5.1. Organizations must develop local checklists or operating instructions to outline
   Comptroller squadron actions and procedures to support base OPLANs and contingency
   situations. These will include deployments, major accident response, natural disaster
   response, terrorist or other base attack response, Force Protection Condition changes,
   reception and beddown of incoming forces, and non-combatant evacuation and/or reception.
   3.5.2. Organizations must review memorandums of understanding and/or agreements with
   tenant units, other local military installations, local governments and other entities to specify
   funding responsibilities in the event of a natural or man-made disaster. These agreements
   must specify the reimbursement procedures when the base provides emergency support to
   non-Air Force or non-DoD activities.
   3.5.3. Organizations must develop agreements with local banks or other financial institutions
   to have sufficient cash available for deployments or other contingency operations during both
   duty and non-duty hours.
   3.5.4. Comptroller Unit Control Center (UCC). Organizations must establish a UCC with
   the capability for command and control of unit resources for response to actual or exercise
   situations. Control centers will have clear, concise, and complete checklists for command
   and control of the types of situations. They must be located in a specifically designated area,
   be ready for immediate operations, and have adequate communications systems.
   3.5.5. Comptroller organizations must have access to a fully operational secure telephone(s)
   and classified e-mail capability at all times. This includes the necessary equipment and the
   trained personnel necessary to access and operate the equipment. Secure phone and
   classified e-mail capability can be resident either within or outside the Comptroller
   organization.
3.6. UTC Posturing. This paragraph describes Financial Management (FM) and AFSCs 65XX
and 6FXXX posturing, coding, and deployment strategy for the full range of military operations
including rotational requirements and surge operations.
   3.6.1. Functional Area Posturing and Sequencing Guidance (FAPSG). Specific posturing
   rules for each AEF cycle will be provided by SAF/FMEP in advance of the cycle IAW AFI
   10-401. These rules will provide specific guidance for posturing UTCs and AFSCs. All FM
   FAMs must follow this guidance. Failure to follow the guidance, including time lines, will
   result in the inappropriate allocation of taskings.
   3.6.2. UTC P-Coding Guidance. Specific coding guidance will be provided by SAF/FMEP
   for each AEF cycle as part of the FAPSG.
AFI10-213 26 FEBUARY 2014                                                                       15

                                 CIVILIAN DEPLOYMENTS

4.1. General. Financial Management civilian employees may volunteer to deploy and support
the contingency operation where mission and funding permits. The final decision on acceptance
of a civilian employee vice a military member rests with the supported command that has the
requirement.
4.2. Qualifications. The civilian volunteer must be a fully qualified DoD civilian employee
who can provide the capabilities described in the MISCAP for the requested UTC. Exceptions
shall be considered on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the civilian volunteer must be able to
meet the requirements of any line remarks associated with the specific tasking. Line remarks
will include, but are not limited to, items such as security clearance, possession of an official
passport, medical and dental clearance, etc. The final authority on functional qualifications
resides with the HAF FAM.
4.3. Training Requirements. Civilians must satisfactorily complete the version of the
Comptroller Contingency Familiarization Course (CCFC) appropriate to their UTC (basic,
advanced, or officer), or equivalent training, prior to volunteering. Civilian volunteers must also
complete the same deployment training required by their military counterparts. Pre-deployment
training, such as anti-terrorism, self-aid buddy care, small arms qualification, Chemical,
Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Defense course and Law of Armed Conflict
training will be scheduled by the organizations UDM after selection for a deployment.
4.4. Emergency-Essential Employee Declaration. Each employee who volunteers for a
deployment must sign a DD Form 2365, DoD Civilian Employee Overseas Emergency-Essential
Position Agreement. All deployed civilian personnel are considered E-E employees, regardless
of whether or not they are E-E personnel at their permanent duty location. Once in theater,
redeployment to another AOR location would only occur if both the individual and the Air Force
agree to do so. (Reference: DoD Directive 1404.10, DOD Civilian Expeditionary Workforce and
AFI 36-507, Mobilization of the Civilian Work Force). Additionally, employees who have a
military recall status (e.g., Ready Reservist), must obtain a waiver relinquishing their military
mobilization obligations.
4.5. Medical and Dental. All personnel entering theater must be medically, dentally, and
psychologically fit for deployment. This includes the ability to accomplish the tasks and duties
unique to a particular operation; it also includes the ability to tolerate the environmental and
operational conditions at the deployed location. DoD Civilians entering theater for 30 days or
more must report 120 days prior to their scheduled departure date to be medically cleared IAW
DoDI 6490.07, Deployment-Limiting Medical Conditions for Service Members and DoD
Civilians, AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning and Execution, and CCDR Reporting Instructions.
DoD Civilians must bring an OF-178, Certificate of Medical Examination with Part B completed
by the Appointing Officer prior to medical clearance. Individuals who fail to complete these
medical requirements will not be cleared to deploy. DoD Civilians must in-process medically
within 5 days of return from theater to complete required medical screening and post deployment
health assessments.
 16                                                              AFI10-213 26 FEBUARY 2014


   4.5.1. Mandatory pre and post deployment medical clearance requirements (Reference: AFI
   10-403 and COCOM Reporting Instructions) will be performed at government
   expense. However, treatment, specialty referrals, or corrective follow-up care or actions for
   pre-existing medical and dental conditions will be at the member’s expense.
   4.5.2. The employee will maintain medical, dental, and psychological fitness throughout the
   deployment period.
4.6. Miscellaneous. Employees must possess or be able to obtain an Official Passport, not a
Tourist Passport. Employees may be reimbursed for the cost of obtaining passports. In addition,
free legal assistance will be provided by the home station legal office to prepare a will, powers of
attorney and basic tax assistance. The servicing personnel office can provide additional
deployment-related information.
4.7. To volunteer.
   4.7.1. Use the current “Volunteer Deployment Application” template provided by the HAF
   FAM.
   4.7.2. The Civilian Personnel Office, the commander or director, the MAJCOM FAM, and
   the HAF FAM will coordinate on the request. For applications requesting consideration for
   external or joint requirements as part of the Civilian Expeditionary Workforce (CEW), the
   HAF FAM will submit to the CEW Program Manager at AFPC/DPIE.
   4.7.3. Email a copy to the MAJCOM/DRU/FOA War Planner with a copy to SAF/FMEW
   Workflow usaf.pentagon.saf-fm.mbx.saf-fmew-workflow@mail.mil
AFI10-213 26 FEBUARY 2014                                                                      17


                                           Chapter 5

                              EDUCATION AND TRAINING

5.1. General. Mission success during any type of contingency depends upon the effectiveness
of individual and unit training. Financial Management personnel must train as closely as
possible to the way they expect to function during a contingency or in wartime. Their training
must be comprehensive and realistic, and incorporate all conceivable missions throughout the
full range of military operations. Training must prepare FM forces for major disasters, military
operations other than war, and full scale theater warfare.
5.2. Training Requirements. All Financial Management military personnel are required to
participate in Combat Comptroller training, which includes home station training and the
Comptroller Contingency Familiarization Course. In addition, Financial Management formal
training courses for officers and enlisted members will include appropriate contingency training
within the curriculum.
5.3. Contingency Training Lifecycle. The contingency training lifecycle is a Total Force
initiative for cradle-to-grave FM contingency training. Contingency training will begin with
accession into the Financial Management career field and will continue throughout each
member’s career. It will include formal and home station training, exercises, and self-study to
ensure each member’s proficiency in assigned contingency duties. This program will ensure
each FM member is fully prepared to deploy without prior notice and successfully execute their
assigned mission.
   5.3.1. Officer. Officers will begin contingency training in the Basic Financial Management
   Officer Course upon accession into the Financial Management career field. It will continue
   through a vigorous home station training program where each officer will practice both
   leadership and financial skills in preparation for contingency operations. While at home
   station, each officer will take the CCFC and receive contingency training as part of the
   curriculum in the Financial Management in-residence PME, with the contingency portion of
   the curriculum focused on Joint operations.
   5.3.2. Enlisted. Enlisted personnel participate in contingency training as part of skill-level
   upgrade training, home station training, basic, and advanced CCFC, in-residence PME
   courses, and other exercise opportunities. Each enlisted person will be certified on all of the
   tasks of his or her assigned UTC list. Refer to the Financial Management and Comptroller
   CFETP for 5 and 7 skill level upgrade training requirements.
   5.3.3. UTC Task List Validation. Training Managers will validate UTC task completion for
   the appropriate skill level 60-90 days prior to deployment. The task lists are available on the
   FM Combat Comptroller sharepoint site. Comptrollers, superintendents, supervisors, trainers
   and trainees are jointly responsible to ensure deploying personnel are knowledgeable and
   capable of performing all tasks on the UTC Task List for the UTC for which the individual
   has been tasked to deploy. They are also responsible to ensure necessary training is
   conducted, documented, and all tasks are completed prior to deployment. The supervisor and
   trainer will evaluate the trainee’s knowledge and ability to perform each task for their tasked
   UTC. If there is an “X” in the block for a task, then it must be trained. Additionally, when
 18                                                             AFI10-213 26 FEBUARY 2014


   personnel have training records in the Air Force Training Record (AFTR), the task must be
   signed off in AFTR for each trainee.
   5.3.4. Home Station Training. Base-level training is an integral part of the Contingency
   Training Lifecycle. A sound base-level contingency training program must include self-
   paced study, over-the-shoulder training, lecture and hands-on techniques. The unit type code
   task listings form the foundation of training plans and will be used as the baseline for base-
   level contingency training requirements. Air Force FM contingency skills are perishable
   simply because of the way we do business. Home station equipment, programs, and
   procedures are different in many cases from deployed equipment, programs, and procedures.
   Effective home station training is critical to provide deployed commanders with fully
   qualified personnel who can provide the full range of financial management capabilities
   demanded in a contingency environment. FM personnel must be fully trained and ready for
   deployment to bare base locations with limited or no facilities and transition to sustained
   operations. In addition to any other training, all military personnel will participate in a
   minimum of two unit led contingency training periods per month. These periods will include
   UTC tasks or ancillary training, but they must specifically address contingency operations.
5.4. Home Station Exercises. Financial Management personnel will exercise deployment tasks
during unit and wing exercises (e.g., Initial Readiness Response Exercises, Combat Employment
Readiness Exercises, or Major Accident Response Exercises). The Comptroller will provide
realistic exercise scenarios and other inputs to Wing exercise planners to facilitate the inclusion
of Financial Management activities in the exercise. Comptrollers, through their unit Exercise
Evaluation Team members, must ensure maximum integration of scenarios with other functional
areas in the same manner as would occur in real-world situations. Minimize simulations as much
as possible. FM activities shall include, but is not required nor limited to: FM station at the

                               SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT

6.1. Deployment Requirements.
   6.1.1. Equipment. Financial Management UTCs must have the necessary supplies and
   equipment available upon arrival at the deployed location to ensure successful mission
   accomplishment. In some instances, supplies and equipment are already present at locations
   where an FM UTC is currently present and deployments occur on a routine rotational basis.
   In other instances, the supported Air Component will arrange to provide required supplies
   and equipment. When neither of these instances occurs, such as deployment to a bare,
   forward or collocated operating base, a Comptroller Deployable LOGDET Kit, UTC
   XFFAG, must be deployed. MAJCOM/FOA/DRU FAMs will posture and P-code UTC
   XFFAG in UTA in accordance with SAF/FM Prioritization and Sequencing Guidance (not
   all bases will posture a LOGDET Kit).
   6.1.2. Passports. All personnel assigned to the XFFA2 UTC, or as a paying/disbursing agent
   with a 6F AF Specialty Code must have a current official government passport based on the
   nature of the duties and unique military missions.
6.2. Deployment Preparation. Financial Management UTCs will prepare and deploy
according to AFI 10-403, applicable reporting instructions and any line item remarks associated
with a specific tasking. Financial Management units will provide input to local deployment
guidance to ensure the deployment guidance meets FM requirements. For example, other base
agencies/units will need to procure, store, maintain, and issue deployment bags, body armor, and
weapons, as necessary, for the FM team to meet its deployment commitment.
6.3. Deployment. In the event of deployment in support of a major combat operation OPLAN
or CONPLAN, personnel deploying on Financial Management UTCs will also review and
adhere to direction and guidance provided in the base support plan/expeditionary site plan for the
deployment location(s), OPORDs, deployment orders (DEPORDs), execute orders (EXORDs)
and/or other authoritative guidance issued by the supported Combatant Commander or Air
Component to include the supported MAJCOM or Component FM.
