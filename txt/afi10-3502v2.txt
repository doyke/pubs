        1.4.4.11. Attend conferences and working groups related to PJ and CRO guidance,
        architecture, training, and mission employment.
1.5. Objectives.
     1.5.1. The PJ and CRO stan/eval program is divided into two core evaluation types and two
     other evaluation types to ensure appropriate qualification/certification and standardization of
     tasks and operations.
     1.5.2. Core Evaluations. The two types of core evaluations are Aircrew Qualification and
     Mission Qualification.
     1.5.3. Aircrew Qualification Evaluation (QUAL). PJ/CRO personnel are considered
     Specialized/Non-rated Aircrew IAW AFI 11-202 V2 chapter 8 and only require a written
     QUAL examination to establish and maintain aircrew qualification. A flight phase
     evaluation is not required or directed and all documentation procedures for PJ/CRO
     personnel will adhere to the guidance contained within Chapter 6 of this AFI.
     1.5.4. Mission Evaluation (MSN). PJ/CRO personnel are required to conduct an employment
     based mission evaluation in order to ensure individuals maintain mission standards IAW this
     AFI. PJ and CROs should be evaluated to their highest mission qualification level. Mission
     qualification levels are Team Commander (TC), Team Member (TM), Element Leader (EL),
     and Team Leader (TL).The MSN evaluation is a full mission profile scenario encompassing
     all fundamental aspects of pre, during, and post mission tasks.
     1.5.5. Other Evaluation Types. In addition to the two Core Evaluations, (QUAL and MSN)
     there are two other types of evaluations. They are Task (TASK) and Instructor (INSTR). See
     Chapter 4 and 5 respectively for applicable guidance.
1.6. Interim Changes/Revisions/Supplements. Will be coordinated IAW AFI 33-360.
1.7. Evaluator Responsibilities.
     1.7.1. Evaluators must be seasoned instructors qualified and current in the events they are
     evaluating. They must be identified as Evaluators on the unit Commander‘s certified Letter
     of X‘s.
     1.7.2. Certified evaluators who subsequently gain advanced certifications are automatically
     certified to evaluate these new qualifications.
     1.7.3. Evaluators will use the evaluation criteria contained within each requirements chapter
     and applicable attachments to ensure standard and objective evaluations. Evaluators will be
     thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria and be the Unit‘s most
     experienced instructors. They will be experts on evaluation criteria, evaluation techniques,
     and documentation requirements. They will assist and notify Stan/Eval with trend data and
     observed deficiencies in training. See Attachment 3 for the minimum task requirements for
     MSN Evaluations.
     1.7.4. Prior to the mission briefings, the evaluator will brief the examinee on specific
     evaluation areas, purpose and conduct of the evaluation.
AFI10-3502V2 30 APRIL 2012                                                                        9


   1.7.5. When mission requirements, team composition requirements, or students are not
   available, the evaluator may serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee‘s
   instructional ability. Except during initial evaluations, or when it is impossible or impractical
   to evaluate a required area, the evaluator may elect to evaluate the area(s) by an alternate
   method (simulator, procedural trainer, or verbal examination) following guidance in para.
   1.9., Verbal Evaluation of Sub-areas.
   1.7.6. During an actual emergency, the evaluator will determine when to terminate an
   evaluation.
   1.7.7. The evaluator will thoroughly debrief all aspects of the evaluation. This debrief will
   include the overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified),
   and required additional training (if applicable).
   1.7.8. Once an evaluation has begun, the evaluator will document the results. Evaluations
   will not be terminated or negated in order to avoid an unsatisfactory grade.
1.8. Grading Systems. A two-tiered grading system is used to evaluate and document PJ and
CRO performance. Individual scores are recorded for QUAL examinations and areas/subareas
are graded for the MSN evaluation. An overall qualification or certification is determined from
the compilation of the individual scores or areas/subareas graded (i.e. Satisfactory /
Unsatisfactory).
   1.8.1. Area/Subarea Grades. The required event tables in Attachment 3 establishes areas
   and subareas to be evaluated during MSN or TASK evaluations - to include the appropriate
   grading criteria for those areas/subareas. Areas/subareas will have a two-level (S/U) or
   three-level (S/S-/U) grading system.
       1.8.1.1. Satisfactory (S). The desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated
       a satisfactory knowledge of all required information, performed PJ or CRO duties within
       the prescribed tolerances, and accomplished the assigned mission.
       1.8.1.2. Satisfactory w/Comments (S-). Indicates the examinee is qualified/certified to
       perform the assigned area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as
       determined by the evaluator. Deviations from established standards must not exceed the
       prescribed S- tolerances or jeopardize safety.
       1.8.1.3. Unsatisfactory (U). Indicates a breach of discipline, performance outside
       allowable parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/tolerances that adversely
       affected mission accomplishment or compromised mission safety. An examinee
       receiving an area/subarea grade of U normally requires additional training. When, in the
       judgment of the evaluator, additional training will not constructively improve examinee‘s
       performance, it is not required. In this case, the evaluator must thoroughly debrief the
       examinee.
   1.8.2. Critical Area. Critical grading areas have been established for all evaluations.
   Critical areas are defined as those core areas, which if not performed to the ―S‖ level, could
   adversely affect the qualification of a PJ or CRO and result in loss of life or damage to
   property. Grade all critical areas as either (S) or (U).
   1.8.3. Qualification Grades. Overall evaluation performance is graded as follows:
10                                                            AFI10-3502V2 30 APRIL 2012


     1.8.3.1. Satisfactory (S). The PJ or CRO demonstrated desired performance and
     knowledge of procedures, equipment and directives within tolerances specified in the
     grading criteria. This will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted, and may be
     awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
         1.8.3.1.1. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the
         debrief of that evaluation.
         1.8.3.1.2. There could be one or more area(s)/subarea(s) where additional training
         was assigned.
         1.8.3.1.3. A non-critical area/subarea grade of U may have been awarded.
         1.8.3.1.4. In the judgment of the evaluator, there is justification based on
         performance in all areas/subareas.
     1.8.3.2. Unsatisfactory (U). The PJ or CRO demonstrated an unacceptable level of
     safety, performance or knowledge and is considered unqualified.
         1.8.3.2.1. A grade of U awarded in a critical area requires an overall (U) for the
         evaluation.
         1.8.3.2.2. One or more discrepancies noted during the evaluation were not cleared
         during the debrief of that evaluation and require additional training prior to re-
         evaluation.
         1.8.3.2.3. An overall (U) can be awarded if, in the judgment of the evaluator, there is
         justification based on performance in one or more areas/subareas.
  1.8.4. Grading Instructions.
     1.8.4.1. Areas/subareas not applicable to the unit or mission need not be performed;
     however, all areas/subareas performed will be graded.
     1.8.4.2. The evaluator will compare examinee performance for each required area
     accomplished during the evaluation with the evaluation criteria provided in each of the
     corresponding sections and assign an appropriate grade. Derive the overall evaluation
     grade from the area grades based on observed events and tasks IAW this instruction.
     1.8.4.3. Evaluator judgment must be exercised when the wording of areas is subjective
     and when specific situations are not covered.
     1.8.4.4. Evaluator judgment will be the determining factor in assigning the overall grade.
  1.8.5. Remedial Action. All grades of S- or less require action to remedy the discrepancy
  and/or deficiency in performance. Remedial action includes debriefing the discrepancy
  and/or assignment of additional training.
  1.8.6. Debriefed Discrepancy. Remedial action accomplished during debrief of the
  evaluation wherein the evaluator provides instruction concerning the discrepancy and
  determines that the examinee has gained the necessary knowledge or proficiency to remedy
  the discrepancy.
  1.8.7. Additional Training. Any training recommended by an evaluator to remedy
  deficiencies identified during an evaluation.
AFI10-3502V2 30 APRIL 2012                                                                        11


       1.8.7.1. May include self-study, ground instruction, or live scenario. To complete
       additional training, the examinee must demonstrate attainment of satisfactory knowledge
       or proficiency.
       1.8.7.2. If a PJ or CRO exceeds the allotted time for completion of additional training to
       meet the Re-Qualification (RQ) evaluation, the squadron commander will review the
       situation and direct appropriate action. This will be documented IAW Chapter 5.
1.9. Verbal Evaluation of Sub-areas.
   1.9.1. For initial/requalification evaluations, all required items must be performed by actual
   demonstration.
   1.9.2. For periodic evaluations, when it is impossible or impractical to evaluate a required
   area, the evaluator may elect to evaluate the area(s) by an alternate method (procedural
   trainer, or verbal examination). Document why required area(s) were not evaluated as part of
   the evaluation and the alternate method of evaluation used in the additional comments
   paragraph of the AF Form 803, Report of Task Evaluations.
   1.9.3. The unit chief of stan/eval, decides if the evaluation is complete.
1.10. Evaluation Prefixes. When applicable, the following prefixes will be used to further
describe each evaluation.
   1.10.1. Initial Evaluation. Initial Evaluations are only required for the first QUAL and first
   MSN evaluation administered to the examinee. The evaluation is documented as INIT
   QUAL or INIT MSN.
NOTE: An INIT QUAL evaluation is a closed book test and will be accomplished prior to the
individual‘s first flying event.
       1.10.1.1. INIT QUAL Evaluation. INIT QUAL evaluations will be accomplished upon
       completion of IQT IAW AFI 10-3502V1, PARARESCUE AND COMBAT RESCUE
       OFFICER TRAINING, Chapter 2 and additional requirements IAW MAJCOM approved
       lesson plans or SOI‘s for the units primary assigned aircraft; this includes vertical lift and
       fixed wing ground training.
       1.10.1.2. INIT MSN Eval (Vertical lift/Fixed wing). INIT MSN evaluations will be
       accomplished once MQT is complete IAW AFI 10-3502V1 Chap 3 (if required) and
       additional requirements from MAJCOM / unit SOPs. Evaluations will be conducted in
       all unit assigned aircraft. Units with no dedicated aircraft will assign a primary aircraft
       for the INIT QUAL and INIT MSN evaluations. Every effort will be made to qualify
       members on both airframes. For subsequent or follow on evaluations see chapter 3.
NOTE: If MQT requires a culminating evaluation, the INIT MSN may be used for both
completion of MQT and CMR certification if all task requirements are met IAW Attachment 3,
PARARESCUE AND COMBAT RESCUE OFFICER EVALUATED EVENT TABLE.
. A failure during this evaluation constitutes a failure for both and the individual must re-
accomplish MQT IAW current directives.
   1.10.2. No-Notice Evaluation (N/N). Examinee is notified of the evaluation at or after the
   beginning of normal preparation for the mission. The intent is to preclude extraordinary
 12                                                           AFI10-3502V2 30 APRIL 2012


   advance preparation for the mission. The beginning of normal preparation for a mission will
   be determined by the evaluator.
       1.10.2.1. The examinee must be notified prior to beginning the task that is being
       evaluated. Informing the examinee after the fact is not allowed.
       1.10.2.2. The N/N evaluation program provides commanders a sampling of performance
       in situations where rehearsal or review is not possible prior to execution.
       1.10.2.3. A N/N evaluation may be used to update a MSN evaluation expiration date
       provided all evaluation requirements are completed IAW Attachment 3.
   1.10.3. Re-Qualification Evaluation (RQ). Conducted when an individual loses his
   qualification/certification. The evaluation will be documented with an RQ prefix (e.g. RQ
   MSN).
1.11. Timing of PJ and CRO Evaluations.
   1.11.1. Expiration Date. Required periodic evaluations expire on the last day of the 17th
   month from the previous QUAL or MSN evaluation (e.g. a periodic evaluation in which the
   evaluation was completed on 9 Oct 10 expires on 31 Mar 12.).
   1.11.2. Failure to Complete an Evaluation within the Required Period. If the individual fails
   to complete an evaluation within the required 17 month window they lose the qualification
   covered by the evaluation.
       1.11.2.1. QUAL Eval. The individual will remain grounded until this is satisfactorily
       completed.
       1.11.2.2. MSN Eval. Non-mission Ready (NMR) IAW AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew
       Training Program. Restrict the individual from unit operational mission capability until
       a successful RQ MSN Eval is completed.
1.12. Extended Evaluations. Coordinate IAW AFI 11-202 V2 para. 5.8.3.2.
1.13. Cross-Command Evaluations. Coordinate IAW AFI 11-202 V2 para. 2.3.5. and
document IAW Chapter 6 of this AFI.
1.14. Status Downgrade. Downgrade individuals receiving an overall ‗Unsatisfactory‘ on their
evaluations.

   System and be allowed to carry the appropriate Aircrew Qualification Code (FJ) IAW AFI
   11-401, Aviation Management, Table A2.3.
NOTE: The Qualification of "FJ" qualifies PJ/CROs to fly without an instructor, provided that
the operator is trained/certified to perform all tasks included in the training profile. For example:
A team performing helicopter operations to accomplish an element leader evaluation: The EJ
may fly on lead with the EL examinee, while an element leader flies on trail with two FJ's,
provided that no new training is introduced on trail during the flight.
2.2. Program Documentation. Units will describe the unit examination program in the unit
supplement to this instruction if applicable.
2.3. Retention of Examination Records. The stan/eval function will retain graded exam
answer sheets or computer records until the AF Form 803 is completed and placed in Tab 5.
Retain failed exams until a passing exam is accomplished or review board conducted.
2.4. Examination Question Sources.
   2.4.1. Master Question File (MQF). MAJCOM A3V PJ/CRO representative (stan/eval
   component) is the OPR for development and maintenance of the MQF.
       2.4.1.1. Lead command will ensure approved PJ and CRO universal qualification MQFs
       for closed book testing are available for MAJCOM use and distribution to applicable
       agencies.

       subject matter may not be changed.
       2.4.1.4. Units will forward edits of MQF questions to the lead MAJCOM through
       stan/eval channels.
       2.4.1.5. If units want to recommend additional questions for inclusion in the next MQF
       re-write, they will submit MQF questions through the appropriate stan/eval channels to
       lead command for approval.
 14                                                          AFI10-3502V2 30 APRIL 2012


   2.4.2. Requirements. The closed book exam will consist of 20 questions. Develop the exam
   according to the following:
      2.4.2.1. All exam questions will cover airmanship, duties on-board the aircraft, safety,
      and equipment procedures for general flight.
      2.4.2.2. General Knowledge. A minimum of 15 general knowledge questions must come
      from the MAJCOM CRO or PJ Master Question File (MQF) depending on AFSC.
      2.4.2.3. Local Procedures. Five questions may come from a local procedure MQF, if
      applicable (increase general knowledge MQF questions to 20 if no local procedures MQF
      is developed).
2.5. Exam Management. IAW AFI 11-202 V2 para. 6.6.

                        MISSION EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

3.1. Mission Evaluation. The MSN evaluation provides employment based qualification in
order to ensure individuals maintain mission standards. The MSN evaluation is a full mission
profile scenario encompassing all fundamental aspects of pre, execution and post mission tasks.
NOTE: This is not a Flight Evaluation. There is no requirement for PJ/CRO personnel to
conduct a flight phase, however, this is a full mission profile and every effort will be made to
conduct an insertion and exfiltration via aircraft for the evaluation.
   3.1.1. After successful completion of MQT and the INIT MSN evaluation, PJ and CRO
   personnel will be considered Mission Qualified in Weapon System and be allowed to carry
   the appropriate Aircrew Qualification Code (MJ) IAW AFI 11-401 Table A2.3.
3.2. MSN evaluations may be conducted during scheduled exercises, with prior
coordination/deconfliction with exercise planners.
   3.2.1. Evaluations during exercises or non-contingency deployments are encouraged.
   3.2.2. Evaluations during contingencies are authorized.
3.3. Evaluation profiles will be based on Designed Operational Capability (DOC) taskings,
training scenarios, and operational missions normally conducted by the unit.
3.4. If practical, evaluations should be conducted in geographic areas not normally used
during training.
3.5. CRO evaluators will administer the CRO MSN Evaluation.
3.6. PJ evaluators will administer the PJ MSN Evaluation. NOTE: If waived, an MFR will
be written prior to the evaluation and placed in front of the affected AF Form 803.
3.7. When evaluating, PJ and CRO evaluators:
   3.7.1. Should ensure individuals are being evaluated to their highest qualification level. If a
   member has not been evaluated to his highest level after two consecutive MSN Evaluations,
   the next evaluation must be to his highest qualification level. This may be accomplished
   with a NN or Task Eval IAW this regulation.
   3.7.2. Will conduct a thorough pre-mission briefing and post mission debriefing for
   examinee(s) and applicable team members on all aspects of the evaluation.
       3.7.2.1. The debrief will include the overall rating, specific deviations, and required
       additional training, if applicable.
   3.7.3. Will immediately correct breaches of safety or discipline for any team member during
   an evaluation. If this situation occurs, the evaluator will debrief unit supervision and if
   appropriate, document the deviation on the affected AF Form 803.
   3.7.4. Will immediately notify the examinee‘s squadron commander, operations officer,
   superintendent of operations and immediate supervisor whenever an unsatisfactory
   performance is observed.
 16                                                             AFI10-3502V2 30 APRIL 2012


   3.7.5. Evaluators should not evaluate examinees for which they are the primary instructors.
   3.7.6. The evaluator should not be incorporated into the evaluation scenario.
3.8. Minimum Requirements. See Attachment 3 for all required tasks that must be
accomplished for a MSN evaluation to be valid. See Attachment 4 for MSN Evaluation Criteria.
3.9. PJ specific requirements. Tactical profiles should include practice or rehearsal in tactics
and procedures, which are common to, and directly associated with the planning, preparation,
insertion, execution, and extraction phases of a tactical rescue operation.
NOTE: There should be a minimum of 2 PJs available as Team Members during the PJ MSN
evaluation.
3.10. CRO specific requirements. The MSN evaluation will reflect the type and difficulty of
tasks required in the performance of normal operational and training events. These evaluations
ensure CROs have the skills and capability to safely and effectively accomplish their core
mission. It will evaluate the CRO‘s ability to perform as a tactical commander with the
knowledge required to make quick, decisive, safe, and actionable decisions concerning the
utilization and employment of personnel and equipment in order to prosecute a full spectrum PR
mission.
NOTE: There should be PJ and SERE Specialists available during the CRO MSN evaluation.
3.11. Failure to Pass a MSN evaluation. An individual will have 30 days to re-accomplish (60
days or two UTAs, whichever is longer, for ARC and ANG units)
   3.11.1. An individual will be non-combat mission ready (N-CMR) IAW AFI 10-3502 V1
   until a successful RQ MSN is accomplished.
   3.11.2. Individual will be placed on supervised status for the specific task that caused the N-
   CMR status, documented on the AF Form 803 under Discrepancies.
AFI10-3502V2 30 APRIL 2012                                                                    17

                         TASK EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

4.1. TASK Evaluation. TASK evaluations are used to provide the commander with feedback
on individual skills or specific team mission capabilities through random evaluations of mission
training and exercises. A TASK evaluation is not intended to satisfy the requirements of a
periodic evaluation. TASK evaluations have no specific time requirements.
   4.1.1. TASK evaluations may be conducted at any time. Personnel receiving TASK
   evaluations must be notified prior to the start of the event. Areas found to be substandard
   will result in the individual being unqualified in those specific tasks and documented IAW
   Chapter 6. Additional training in the substandard task or tasks will be given and a re-
   qualification/certification evaluation is required prior to re-qualification/certification.
   4.1.2. PJ and CRO evaluators may administer evaluations to either AFSC for similar tasks
   (e.g., AIE, Jump Master, Instructor) only if the task, condition and standard for the event is
   identical. These will be documented as TASK evaluations (see Chapter 6).

                    INSTRUCTOR EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS

5.1. INSTR Evaluation. INSTR evaluations will be IAW PJ-CRO Trainer and Instructor
Upgrade TCSs and INSTR Evaluation Criteria. See Table 5.1 for all required tasks that must be
accomplished for an INSTR evaluation to be valid. See Attachment 5 for INSTR Evaluation
Criteria. Prior to the INSTR Evaluation, individuals will successfully complete a MAJCOM
approved Instructor Upgrade Program. The individual will act as an INSTR on actual
instructional training missions. This evaluation will be conducted once the approved syllabus is
complete.
NOTE: PJ and CRO personnel holding instructor certification as of the date of this publication
do not require an INSTR evaluation.
   5.1.1. If INSTR qualification is lost, it may be regained through an instructor re-certification
   evaluation.
5.2. Instructor Responsibilities.
   5.2.1. Instructor candidates must be qualified in all sub-areas they will instruct. They must
   be authorized by their squadron commanders as instructors (documented on the unit Letter of
   X‘s). It is highly recommended that squadrons prioritize 7 level upgrade training prior to
   Instructor upgrade for the individual.
   5.2.2. Instructor candidates will be evaluated on instructional ability, knowledge,
   briefings/debriefings and demonstration of events.         Instructors must have a solid
   understanding of systems, procedures, and techniques. They must be able to convey these to
   a student in a clear and effective manner. They must also have the judgment to immediately
   recognize and control unsafe situations.
   5.2.3. Whenever possible, instructor evaluations should be conducted with a "student"
   occupying the applicable role. The "student" will perform those duties prescribed by the
   instructor for the task being accomplished. The instructor examinee will monitor all phases of
   training from an advantageous position and be prepared to demonstrate, terminate, or explain
   any procedure.

                                     DOCUMENTATION

6.1. Scope. Administration of the evaluation program requires accurate documentation. The
qualifications/certifications for which a PJ and CRO are to be evaluated are determined by
Chapter 1 of this document.
6.2. Procedures. Each PJ and CRO will maintain a Tab 5 within their Individual Training and
Evaluation Folder (ITEF) or On-the-Job Training (OJT) Records, respectively.
   6.2.1. The Tab 5 will contain the source documents that constitute the history of PJ and CRO
   qualifications/certifications. All evaluations will be documented on an AF Form 803, Report
   of Task Evaluations.
   6.2.2. An AF Form 1522, ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Report will be
   submitted to HARM and maintained in the ARMS database after the completion of each
   QUAL and MSN evaluation.

   6.2.3. Individuals assigned or attached to other than USAF units may use the format of the
   service of the unit of attachment to document their history of qualification/certification.
   6.2.4. Units will define local procedures for Tab 5 storage.
       6.2.4.1. Storage procedures must ensure stan/eval accountability and accessibility.
       6.2.4.2. If the Tab 5 is not stored within the ITEF or OJT Records, an MFR will be
       placed in the appropriate Tab indicating storage location.
6.3. Contents of the Tab 5. File AF Form 803s in chronological order with the most recent on
top. Maintain all AF Form 803s for the entire duration of the member‘s service effective
publication of this instruction. (Until a qualification evaluation is completed and documented on
an AF Form 803, the current AF Form 8A will remain inspectable).
NOTE: All AF Form 8As will be retained as historical documents. Place AF Form 8As in
chronological order behind all AF Form 803‘s. AF Form 8As will not be inspectable once a
current AF Form 803 is accomplished. The AF Form 942 may be discarded IAW para 6.10.
   6.3.1. MFRs documenting waivers, extensions, and/or unusual circumstances to potentially
   be included in an AF Form 803 are filed on top of the affected AF Form 803.

   disposal.
6.5. Initial Review. Units will review the Tab 5 for all newly assigned PJs and CROs to
establish their currency and qualification/certification prior to their first training event.
   6.5.1. The reviewing organization is responsible for verifying the currency and
   qualification/certification of a PJ or CRO as determined from the latest applicable
   documentation in the Tab 5. Following determination of the currency and
   qualification/certification of the PJ or CRO, the unit maintaining the Tab 5 is responsible
   only for documentation subsequently placed in the Tab 5.
   6.5.2. If the Tab 5 of HHQ personnel on active flying status is maintained by the stan/eval
   function at their assigned stations, that stan/eval function will also review the Tab 5 prior to
   their first training event. Document the initial review on the AF Form 623A, IAW unit or
   MAJCOM supplements.
6.6. Posting Review. The stan/eval function will review each AF Form 803 when they are
placed in the Tab 5 to ensure accuracy and completeness. This review will confirm that the
qualification/certification as documented is correct, all required evaluation events were
accomplished, and that the AF Form 803 contains the evaluator‘s signature and initials from both
the member and unit stan/eval.
   6.6.1. The stan/eval function will scan and retain each AF Form 803 electronically in an
   electronic Tab 5 for each member.
6.7. Periodic Review. The stan/eval function will review Tab 5 to confirm expiration dates
used to track required periodic PJ or CRO evaluations are the same as those listed in ARMs or
PEX. Document the periodic review on the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training Record –
Continuation Sheet IAW unit or MAJCOM supplements. Periodic review of Tab 5s for
personnel in inactive status is not required.
6.8. Tab 5 Discrepancies. Tab 5 discrepancies include those of the AF Form 803, and any
MAJCOM-directed documentation.
   6.8.1. Major Discrepancies Disposition. Major discrepancies are those that affect the
   qualification of the affected member. They will be documented on a permanent MFR filed in
   Tab 5 immediately above the affected AF Form 803. An MFR created to document late
   evaluations, OG/CC waivers, etc. is removed from the Tab 5 once the information is
   incorporated onto the completed, affected AF Form 803 under Remarks.
   6.8.2. Minor Discrepancies Disposition. Minor discrepancies are those that do not affect
   the qualification of the affected member. All minor discrepancies are corrected IAW para.

       7.3.1.2. The stan/eval requirements from AFI 10-3502V2 and MAJCOM Supplements.
       7.3.1.3. Any Duty Not Involving Flying (DNIF) status.
       7.3.1.4. Currency on all FCIF Volume 1, Part B and C items.
   7.3.2. Units will define and publish their positive control system in the unit supplement to
   this instruction.
7.4. Supplementary Evaluations. Complete IAW AFI 11-202V2, para. 9.4. and MAJCOM
Sup.
7.5. Stan/Eval Board (SEB). IAW AFI 11-202V2, MAJCOM and unit supplements.
7.6. Stan/Eval Visits. HHQ Stan/Eval Staffs may visit units during the administration of formal
inspections, Staff Assistance Visits (SAVs) or in an informal capacity, as specified in MAJCOM
Supplements. MAJCOM PJ and CRO FMs should be present for formal ASEVs. Additional
unique CRO and PJ ASEV formal inspection requirements are listed below:
   7.6.1. The QUAL evaluation will be administered IAW Chapter 2 to 100% of available PJ
   and CRO personnel.
   7.6.2. The unit will receive fixed wing, vertical lift and/or ground mission MSN evaluations
   based on TC, TM, EL, and TL manning, available supporting resources, and unit METLs.
   7.6.3. If available, 100% of OJT and ITEF records will be inspected to validate unit
   capability and individual qualifications to accomplish assigned taskings.
   7.6.4. Inspection evaluation support will be coordinated through the OGV or Unit CRO and
   PJ Stan/Eval section.
7.7. Unit Supplemental Examinations (optional). Each OGV or CCV function may conduct
supplemental testing for all PJs or CROs. The intent of this testing is to evaluate additional
knowledge beyond the scope of required periodic exams, such as a cross-section of general
knowledge, tactical/threat knowledge, and/or operational procedures, etc., to determine if
knowledge deficiencies exist within the unit (e.g. 3-3.Guardian Angel). This exam may be open
or closed book, but will not count as a required periodic exam, nor will a periodic exam satisfy
the requirement for a supplemental exam. Units will describe this program in the unit supplement
to this instruction, to include procedures for failed exams.
7.8. Review Board Process. Review boards are designed to look at the overall evaluation or
training process to deliver an impartial judgment. Review boards look at the trainee and the
training process to see if the failure is individual, institutional, or procedural.
   7.8.1. Convene a Review Board when:
       7.8.1.1. Directed by the commander.
       7.8.1.2. A PJ or CRO fails a re-evaluation/re-certification.
       7.8.1.3. After any incident that compromised safety or resulted in injury to personnel or
       damage to equipment through negligence or violation of directives.
       7.8.1.4. A review board is not required in situations where personnel do not yet hold the
       AFSC of PJ or CRO.
AFI10-3502V2 30 APRIL 2012                                                                    27


7.9. Composition of Review Boards. CCV conducts the review board for their specific AFSC.
EXCEPTION: For SQ/CC, OGV Personnel, or personnel attached to the squadron (i.e. HHQ)
the OG/CC will conduct and determine the composition of the review board. If a primary board
member cannot be present, the commander will designate an alternate. The alternate will
typically be the next senior ranking member of the AFSC involved. The reviewer‘s direct
supervisor may observe the board proceeding; however, he will not be a voting member. The
commander may observe the proceedings as a non-voting member since the board recommends
action to the commander.
   7.9.1. CRO Review Board will consist of the CRO assigned to CCV, the operations officer,
   and the CRO assigned to OGV (or other CRO designated by OG/CC).
   7.9.2. PJ Review Board will consist of the PJ assigned to CCV, the operations officer, the
   senior PJ assigned to the squadron, and the PJ assigned to OGV (or other PJ designated by
   the OG/CC).
7.10. Review Board Actions. The board will evaluate and analyze all factors bearing on a
situation and provide the commander with recommendations. Recommendations may include
removal of an advanced skill qualification, additional supervised training, or recommendation for
removal from the AFSC. Board findings of personnel retained in the AFSC will be maintained
on file for 18 months. If AFSC removal is recommended, the unit training manager will
coordinate required actions with the base training office for guidance and documentation
management procedures.
   7.10.1. Actions resulting in the recommendation for removal of an AFSC will be forwarded
   to the next higher headquarters or MAJCOM level as appropriate.
7.11. Trend Program. Units will establish and maintain a trend program designed to identify
areas requiring attention, monitoring or correction.
   7.11.1. Scope will include trend analysis of all evaluations.
   7.11.2. When trends are noted, recommend corrective action and assign an OPR/Office of
   Collateral Responsibility (OCR).
   7.11.3. Report trends and status to the OG/CC during the SEB until closed (see AFI 11-
   202V2 Attachment 2). Maintain an archive of trend data for at least one year from the date
   the trend was identified.
7.12. Briefing Facilities. Mission planning/briefing materials will be available in either the
mission planning area or mission briefing rooms (specific location as determined by the unit) and
IAW AFI 11-202 V2 and MAJCOM supplement.
7.13. AF Form 847 Program. AF Form 847s are vital to enhance operational efficiency,
correct content errors, or recommend improved procedures. Recommendation for Air Force
Publication improvements will be IAW AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-215 (Chapter 9, 10, and
Attachment 3), and applicable MAJCOM Supplements.

7.14. Electronic Data Storage. Units may use electronic database files for record keeping,
trend analysis, printing of standard forms, etc. MAJCOMs will establish standards for archiving
and inspection of electronic files. Units not in compliance will maintain hard-copy records as
directed in this instruction.
