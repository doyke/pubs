1. General.
1.1. Inspection Checklists are the primary lists used during the HQ AFGSC/IG UCI. Checklist
items are defined by the AFGSC staff and based upon guidance governing the particular
Checklist area of focus. This guidance may include existing “by-law” requirements, Executive
Orders, DoD directives, AF and AFGSC instructions, and mission areas deemed critical by AF
or GSC leadership to assessing and assuring unit organizational health and/or performance. The
objective of the Checklist is to identify deficiencies that preclude attainment of required
capabilities.
1.2. Critical Compliance Objectives (CCOs) represent the highest priority of inspection items
and are fundamentally derived from the Common Core Compliance Areas (CCCAs) and the
fourteen mission areas defined in AFI 90-201, Inspector General Activities. Lower tier Core and
General Compliance Items may be stand alone or subordinate to a CCO. During the CI, it is the
intent of the HQ AFGSC/IG to inspect, as a minimum, 100% of the CCOs that apply to the
inspected unit. However, Checklist items listed do no limit the scope of the inspection. Critical,
core and general compliance criteria are defined as follows:
1.2.1. Critical Compliance Objective (CCO). An item where failure to comply with
established guidance could result in significant liabilities, loss of life or serious injury, or
significant mission impact. Key mission areas include:
- Airman development programs
- Ability to deploy forces
- Ability to employ forces
CCOs are shown in BOLD AND ALL CAPS FORMAT.
1.2.2. Core Compliance Item (CCI). An item or area that requires special vigilance and is
important to the overall performance of the unit, but are not deemed "Critical." Non-compliance
would result in some negative impact on mission performance or could result in injury or
possible litigations. CCIs are shown in ALL CAPS FORMAT.
1.2.3. General Compliance Item (GCI). An item or area deemed fundamental to successful
overall performance of the unit, but non-compliance would result in minimal impact on mission
accomplishment or would be unlikely to result in injury or possible litigation. GCIs are shown in
sentence case format.
Application of items. All items apply to wing-level and above organizations. Items identified
with an asterisk (*) indicate operational (WFHQ/AOC/IOT) requirements only.
