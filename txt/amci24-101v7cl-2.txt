    Any vehicle/item that exceeds the limitation/procedures of
    this manual shall have the specific approval of WR-ALC/
    LATET or a letter of air transportability certification from
    ASC/ENFC or shall not be airlifted. Failure to comply could
    result in structural damage to the aircraft

                                NOTE
    It is not acceptable to take a pallet that has been rejected
    for airlift (missing rings, delaminated, etc.) and place it on
    top of another pallet to airlift it. If the pallet has been re-
    jected for airlift, it shall not be used in any way to support
    cargo.

    1. Condition of Pallet and Nets               CHECKED

    2. Security of Nets                           CHECKED

                Pallets to be loaded in positions 1, 2, 35, and 36 shall have
                a 14-inch aisle on the outboard edge and not exceed 7,500
                lb gross weight each. Additionally, pallets loaded in posi-
                tions 35 and 36 shall be limited to a maximum height of 70
                inches at the aft edge of the pallet.

                To ensure vertical clearance when near the cargo compart-
                ment sidewall, position palletized cargo with an outboard
                height of 114 inches or greater or with lateral overhang,
                out of the logistics restraint rail system. Do not exceed 108
                inches above the surface of the pallet when loaded
                through the aft doors or 156 inches when loaded through
                the forward doors.

                               NOTE
    Hazardous cargo that is considered jettisonable shall not
    be positioned forward of non-jettisonable cargo, except
    when its size, weight, and location will permit jettisoning
    by hand. Depending upon the amount of hazardous cargo,
    placement aboard the aircraft should normally be planned
    for the aft section of the cargo compartment. Hazardous
    cargo will never be loaded in such a manner that would
    make jettisoning impossible.

    17. Standing water/snow removed from pallets CHECKED

    4. Tanker Type/Fire Fighting Vehicles          CHECKED


                               NOTE
    Check for the presence of liquids. Tanker type vehicles
    (trailer or self-contained) are not normally certified as air
    transportable in a loaded configuration (liquid in tank). The
    structural integrity of most tanker type vehicles does not
    meet the design criteria to withstand the G forces encoun-
    tered during flight. (Exceptions: The M-149A2 water trailer
    has been certified for airlift, provided the tank is no more
    than ¾ full and the manhole cover is secured with tiedown
    straps. Fire fighting vehicles are certified for transport with
    up to 150 gallons of AFFF (foam agent) in the tank.)

                Outboard logistic rail mechanisms with broken or missing
                cables may be used to restrain pallets provided the detents
                are locked in their over-center (locked) positions, using
                locking tees locally manufactured and installed in Accor-
                dance with Section III.


                                            NOTE
               Ensure all detents are engaged, all required retractable lips
               are extended, and lip pins engaged. When pallet trains are
               loaded, ensure all lips and detents are engaged for the lead-
               ing pallet. All of the remaining detents for the additional pa-
               llets will be engaged, if possible. When sufficient detents
               cannot be engaged to provide the necessary restraint, tie-
               down chains and devices shall be used.

                                        WARNING

                 Only essential personnel are permitted in the cargo com-
                 partment during winching operation.
                 • Winching is a potentially hazardous operation. Refer to
                 all warnings and cautions in Section IV prior to winch
                 operations.
                 • On/off loading cargo during fueling operations is
                 permissible only under certain conditions. Refer to TO
                 00-25-172 for additional instructions.


                                        WARNING
                Maintain tension on the cable to prevent a slack cable con-
                dition during off loading. A slack cable condition can occur
                as the cargo goes over the ramp crest causing the cargo to
                lunge forward, jerking the cable, causing cable failure, in-
                jury to personnel, and damage to equipment.

                                        WARNING
                Do not use wheel chocks to prevent vehicles or other
                wheeled equipment from rolling down the forward ramp,
                ramp extension and toes or the aft ramp, pressure door
                and toes in the drive-in position. Failure to comply could
                result in injury to personnel as vehicle could jump the
                chocks.

                                        CAUTION
                When cargo is to be winched into or out of the airplane,
                maintain a minimum of 12 inches of clearance between
                truck bed or flat bed and the end of the airplane ramp (aft
                loading). This clearance is to allow for possible movement
                of the vehicle or the airplane.

                                        CAUTION
                When snatch blocks are attached to the cargo floor, ensure
                shoring is placed between the snatch block hook and the
                tiedown ring pan receptacle. This will prevent damage to the
                tiedown ring pan receptacle during the winching opera-
                tions.

      Ensure that winching operations are performed by a mini-
      mum of a winch operator and two guides. The guides shall
      be responsible for the following:
        a. Monitor cargo clearances.
        b. Control the position of the cargo through the use of
             prearranged hand signals.
        c. Ensure that winch cable does not foul or snag.
        d. Ensure chocks are readily available to chock wheeled
             type cargo.

                                 WARNING

     If the airplane snatch blocks are to be used, do not exceed
     their rated capacity of 15,000 pounds or 3/8-inch diameter
     cable size. Failure to comply could cause failure of the
     snatch block and result in injury to personnel.

                                WARNING

     Ensure that personnel do not step over the winch cable
     attached to cargo

                                WARNING
      Ensure all personnel wear work gloves when handling the
      winch cable. Failure to comply could result in injury to per-
      sonnel.

                                 CAUTION
      When cargo is being on/off loaded and the winch cable
      does not rest on one of the cable wear strips, provide a
      temporary wear strip under the cable to protect the crest of
      the ramp. Failure to comply could result in damage to the
      ramp floor at the crest area.

                Winch cargo into position. If it is necessary to reconfigure
                the cable prior to reaching the final cargo position, attach
                safety chains, reconfigure the cable, and recheck all at-
                tachment points. Always maintain tension on the winch
                cable, while reeling in or out, to prevent cable entangle-
                ment and snagging.

                Only essential personnel are permitted in the cargo com-
                partment during winching operation.
                • On/off loading cargo during fueling operations is
                permissible only under certain conditions. Refer to TO
                00-25-172 for additional instructions.
                • Use of the winch in the cargo compartment is prohibited
                during defueling operations.

                                        WARNING
                Maintain tension on the cable to prevent a slack cable con-
                dition during off-loading. A slack cable condition can occur
                as the cargo goes over the ramp crest causing the cargo to
                lunge forward, jerking the cable, causing cable failure, in-
                jury to personnel, and damage to equipment.

                                        WARNING
                Do not use wheel chocks to prevent vehicles or other
                wheeled equipment from rolling down the forward ramp,
                ramp extension and toes or the aft ramp, pressure door
                and toes in the drive-in position. Failure to comply could
                result in injury to personnel as vehicle could jump the
                chocks.

                                        CAUTION
                When cargo is to be winched into or out of the airplane,
                maintain a minimum of 12 inches of clearance between
                truck bed or flat bed and the end of the airplane ramp (aft
                loading). This clearance is to allow for possible movement
                of the vehicle or the airplane.

                                        CAUTION
                When snatch blocks are attached to the cargo floor, ensure
                shoring is placed between the snatch block hook and the
                tiedown ring pan receptacle. This will prevent damage to the
                tiedown ring pan receptacle during the winching opera-
                tions.

                                       WARNING

                An unserviceable winch cable can be a hazard to the load-
                ing crew during winch on/off loading operations. It could
                break under load and whiplash, resulting in serious injury
                to personnel and/or causing severe damage to the aircraft.
                Before any winching is accomplished, inspect the winch
                cable as described in step 4.14.4.k and step 4.14.4.l.

     Failure to ensure the thrust bearing is installed may cause
     the hook to separate from the winch cable, resulting in
     injury to loading personnel and/or damage to the airplane.

                                 CAUTION

      When snatch blocks are attached to the cargo floor, ensure
      shoring is placed between the snatch block hook and the
      tiedown ring pan receptacle. This will prevent damage to
      the tiedown ring pan receptacle during the winching opera-
      tions.

                                   NOTE

     APEX personnel are expected to utilize interphone capability.
     This will be especially critical during APU operations.
     Aircraft interphone communications may be necessary when
     Maintenance supervisor is not in the cargo compartment.
     Ensure that communications are maintained at all times
     between all on/off loading personnel.


                                   NOTE
      Observers will be on interphone if the configuration or size
      of the cargo being winched prevents a clear view of all ob-
      servers by the winch operator, or if excessive noise pro-
      hibits verbal communication.
