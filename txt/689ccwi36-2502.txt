     9.3. Grade each nomination package individually, awarding points based on three factors:
     (1) Leadership and Job Performance, (2) Training, Education and Self-Improvement Efforts,
     and (3) Other Accomplishments.
     9.4. Review each nominee package and rank accordingly. It is important to take notes
     during the scoring process to be prepared to openly discuss scoring considerations if the
     board president deems necessary. Forward scored results prior to central board to the 689
     CCW/Command Chief inbox.
10. Board Composition.
     10.1. Units with seven or more eligible Airmen receive quotas and promote at the unit level.
     Commanders will either establish their own written selection procedures or use guidance
     provided in this instruction to implement their programs.
     10.2. Units with six or less eligibles are combined into one pool of eligibles to form the CBB
     population for 689 CCW units. The 689 CCW/CCC or designated CMSgt will serve as
     board president with four voting members in the grade of CMSgt or (C)MSgt and a board
     recorder (provided by the 689 CCW/CCC).
11. Method/Number of Nominations.
     11.1. Units with seven or more eligibles will use the BTZ eligibility list and quotas to make
     selections at unit level.
     11.2. Commanders with six or less eligibles will use the BTZ eligibility list and appropriate
     evaluation process (e.g., a unit board, record review, recommendation from supervisors/first
     sergeants, etc) to determine nominees for the 689 CCW CBB.
     11.3. Individuals nominated will only be the very best performers and Airmen. They must
     be positive role models for others and clearly deserve the recognition. The unit commander
     will ensure the nominee meets current and passing fitness standards and exemplifies the
     standards for appearance and conduct. Commanders and First Sergeants will screen out
     those with negative ―Quality Force‖ indicators. If the pool of eligibles does not include
     Airmen of this caliber, the full SrA BTZ quota does not have to be used.
     11.4. Units will consider all individuals meeting TIS and TIG requirements, regardless if
     they are TDY, on leave or have a report not later than date (RNLTD) on or after the first day
     of the first processing month as defined in Paragraph 1.1. All individuals appearing on the
     eligibility listing must be ―considered.‖ However, this does not mean they must be
     recommended or nominated to meet the board.
12. Scoring Scale/Selection Phase.
     12.1. A maximum score of 15 points is possible. The AF Form 1206 will be accomplished
     for all nominees. The AF Form 1206 is limited to 15 lines (headings are excluded from the
     15 line count). Headings should be included in the body of the AF Form 1206. Points will
     be awarded based on three factors:
689CCWI36-2502 17 MAY 2012                                                                    5


(1) Leadership and Job Performance in Primary Duties (0-10 points)
(2) Training, Education and Self-Improvement Efforts (0-3 points)
(3) Other Accomplishments (0-3 points)
   12.2. Ranking. After scoring each AF Form 1206, the board member will then assign that
   individual a numerical ranking to show how that Airman compares to the other nominees
   being considered. The ranking should fall in line with the score of the nominee’s AF Form
   1206. (e.g. A1C John Doe has a score of ―15‖, consequently A1C John Doe is ranked #1).
   Board members will break ties and assign a ranking.
   12.3. Scoring Disparity. The board president may address significant disparity in ranking
   and scoring at any time. For example, majority of the board are within an acceptable range
   (#1,#2,#1) and one voting member ranks an individual as their ―#6‖. The president will lead
   an open discussion until the board members understand the disparity. If the disparity affects
   the order of merit, then that record will be rescored.
13. Board Recorder
   13.1. Board Recorder. The board recorder will record each board member’s score and
   ranking of each nominee. Scores and rankings of each nominee will be tallied for an overall
   score and overall ranking (e.g. nominee ranked as board member A’s #1, board member B’s
   #2, board member C’s #1, board member D’s #1 will receive a total points ranking of 5).
   The board recorder will then determine an order-of-merit by placing the lowest scoring first
   and the highest scoring last on the ―BTZ Board Recorder’s Ballot‖. The order-of-merit
   ranking should be in line with the total score that each nominee received.
13.2. Day of Board Procedures:
       13.2.1. Print packages out in a hard copy, print oath, print recorder’s score sheet, and
       bring calculator to board meeting.
       13.2.2. Shut and lock door in conference room doing board once all board members
       arrive.
       13.2.3. Retrieve score sheets from each board member.
       13.2.4. If a board member has not completed his/her score sheet all board members will
       wait until he/she completes the scoring.
       13.2.5. The board president will present the oath prior to starting the board.
       13.2.6. The board recorder will tally the calculated scores on the master score sheet
       (calculate lowest scores with lowest total score being #1 selection).
       13.2.7. Once scores have been calculated, announce to the board members the
       recommended selections and their scores.
       13.2.8. In the event of a tie, the board president will break the tie (board members can
       discuss the decision).
       13.2.9. At the end of the board, ask the board members for feedback.
 6                                                            689CCWI36-2502 17 MAY 2012


        13.2.10. Write down the adjournment time as required by the memorandum. Upon board
        completion, all board members turn in score sheets and selection packages to the board
        recorder.
        13.2.11. Complete member score sheet and memorandum.
        13.2.12. The board recorder and president will sign, and 689 CCW/CC will approve the
        memorandum recording the BTZ results.
14. Reporting Board Results.
     14.1. Wing Central Base Board. Once selections are made, provide the 78 FSS and 72 FSS
     with a copy of the signed memo to update member’s promotion status in MILPDS.
14.2. Once selections are made at units with seven or more eligibles, a signed
memorandum will be provided to their respective FSS/MPS so the member promotion can
be      updated       in     MILPDS. Courtesy           copy       the  689    CCW/CCC
689ccw.ccc.commch@robins.af.mil at the same time results are sent to the FSSs. Memo must
be signed and submitted to FSS on the same date of the unit board date.
     14.2.1. The squadron commander will announce their selectees only after respective
     convening authority (689 CCW/CC) has approved the CBB selections.
     14.3. For the 689 CCW Central Base Boards, the board president sends a report written by
     the board recorder to the convening authority with an order of merit list of all Airmen
     considered. The convening authority (689 CCW/CC) may approve the board’s merit list or
     disapprove the promotion of an Airman whose records do not justify SrA BTZ promotion.
     The convening authority may elect not to use the full quota.
     14.4. Once the CBB results have been signed and approved, the board recorder will forward
     results to the 72 and 78 FSS/FSMPFSs and will provide an electronic copy of the select list
     to the 689 CCW/CC. The 689 CCW/CC will inform the group commanders to notify their
     respective squadron commanders of the CBB results.
     14.5. The 72 and 78 FSS/FSMPFSs will project all SrA BTZ promotions immediately upon
     receipt of confirmation of selections from the 689 CCW/CC, convening authority for the
     CBB. This must be accomplished prior to the end of the board month.
15. Alternate Selection. Alternates may be selected in the event a selectee is removed or not
recommended for promotion before the promotion effective date. The 72 and 78 FSS/FSMPSs
will review board minutes to determine who the first alternate is and notify the commander of
that individual. If the commander recommends the alternate for promotion, he/she forwards a
letter to 72 and 78 FSS/FSMPSs for concurrence by the respective convening authority.
16. Supplemental Consideration. If an eligibile Airman was not considered and the error is
discovered before the promotions are announced, commanders with seven or more eligibles
consider the Airman and adjust selections accordingly. For units with six or less eligibles, the
respective CBB will be reconvened to consider eligibles and adjust selections accordingly. If the
error is found after the promotions are announced, the 72 or 78 FSS/FSMPSs will forward a
request for supplemental consideration, by message, to HQ AFPC/DPPWM.
