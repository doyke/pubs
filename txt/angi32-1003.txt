This instruction implements AFPD 32-10, Installations and Facilities. It establishes the Facilities Board
(FB) at each Air National Guard (ANG) installation and assigns responsibilities and membership.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS
This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.


1. Board Responsibilities. The ANG Installation Commander (CC) will establish a Facilities Board.
The primary responsibility of the FB is to ensure that facilities and infrastructure are able to fully support
the assigned missions. The FB should establish metrics to assess the management of Civil Engineering
(CE) resources. Metrics should be reviewed and acted on by the FB. The chairperson may establish, in
writing, a Facilities Board Working Group(s) (FBWG) to assist the FB with drafting options and recom-
mendations, as necessary. The Chairperson of the FBWG will make recommendation to the FB chair and
the minutes of the FBWG will be an attachment to the FB minutes. The FB will meet two times a year, as
a minimum and more often if required, to review and act upon facility and infrastructure programs, upon
any pending real property actions, and base development issues. The FB should try to meet in the spring
and fall time frame. The attached calendar identifies major actions requiring FB oversight and will aid in
planning the FB agendas. Discussion of all required actions is not required at each FB meeting. Certain
items may be addressed quarterly. Others may be addressed on a yearly basis. An agenda should be pub-
lished prior to each meeting.

2. Board Membership will include:
   2.1. Decision making members (voting).
         Wing or Installation/CC as the Board Chairperson.
         Base Civil Engineer as the recorder.
2                                                                       ANGI32-1003 1 JANUARY 2005


         Group Commanders, and Commanders of Geographically Separated Units (GSU) supported,
         if applicable.
    2.2. Advisory representatives (non-voting).
         Environmental Manager.
         Assistant Base Civil Engineer.
         Facility Manager.
         Fire Chief.
         Real Property Manager.
         Safety Officer.
         Finance Officer.
         Communications Officer.
         Security Officer.
         Others as desired by the chairperson, (e.g., Commander of military organizations).
         Chairperson of the FBWG.
         Commander or designated representative of each Tenant organization (ANG or NON ANG).
         Other agency advisory members: United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) Contracting
         Officer.

3. Quorum and Meeting Minutes : A quorum should consist of the Board Chairperson, Base Civil
Engineer, and a minimum of three other voting members or their alternates, designated (in writing). The
GSU commander, or his/her representative(s), shall be present when voting on actions pertaining to or
affecting their GSU. The USPFO contracting officer designated (in writing) alternate should be present
when discussing actions to be contracted through the USPFO. Minutes will be distributed to all affected
organizations. An electronic copy of the FB meeting minutes shall be sent to the state’s ANG, Civil Engi-
neer Programming (ANG/CEP) programmer. An information copy sent to the USPFO and others desig-
nated by the Wing Commander (e.g., The Adjutant General {TAG}).

4. Specific Responsibilities : The FB reviews and validates facility programs and individual projects,
establishes the need and priority order in which the projects are to be designed and funded within the var-
ious programs (listed below). Board members representing a functional area should advocate their facility
needs and assist in determining the impact proposed projects will have on other organization(s) mis-
sion(s). The FB will insure project priorities and recommendations are executable in the year requested.
    4.1. Facility Projects: The FB reviews, validates, and sets the priority order in which projects are to be
    designed and funded. This is the “Project Priority List” and, as a minimum, will contain the current
    and next four fiscal years (FY) for Sustainment, Restoration, and Modernization (SRM) projects. Mil-
    itary Construction (MILCON) projects can be projected out longer for MILCON projects the priority
    list should include all validated projects. The integrated SRM priority list will show three levels of
    projects; the locally approved and funded, locally approved and funded by ANG, Civil Engineer
    (ANG/CE), and those requiring ANG/CE or higher approval and funding. The last two levels will be
    forwarded to ANG/CEP.

         Base Civil Engineer (BCE) or an FBWG may submit a draft project priority list, however, the
         FB is responsible as the corporate body to ensure the most urgent and executable facility
         needs, in support of the mission, are being met.
  4.2. The following real property management actions must be presented annually, as a minimum, for
  board approval and more often if needed. The attached calendar of major events will aid in scheduling

       master plan and AT/FP standards as defined in the Unified Facilities Code (UFC).
       4.2.22. If not accomplished in another meeting, (e.g., Financial Management Board) the Board
       should review and reconcile the Civil Engineer Program execution data by Program Element Code
       (PEC) and Element of Expense Investment Code (EEIC) from two perspectives; (1) From BCE
       data base and (2) Base Financial Management (FM) database. This review will be done at two

agement of CE resources. These metrics should be reviewed and acted on by the FB. They should include
the following applicable programs: Facilities Investment Metric (FIM), Installation Readiness Report
(IRR), Energy Reduction Program, Airfield Waiver Reduction Program, The Fire Deficiency Reduction
Program, (using fire safety deficiency ratings), AT/FP Improvement Program, Airfield Pavement
Improvement Program, Health And Safety Hazards Elimination Program, Facility Shortage /Overage
Program(920), CE Awards Program, Emergency Type Requirements, Building Demolition Program, and
Temporary/Relocatable Facilities Program.

Terms
Facility Investment Metric (FIM)—The corporate Air Force program for identifying and advocating
funds for major repair ($100K and up) and minor construction projects. (This is work above the
sustainment threshold). Projects are given a FIM rating based on the facilities current impact on the
Wing’s primary mission. Ratings are:
Critical—Significant loss of installation/tenant mission capability and frequent mission interruptions.
Work-arounds are continuously needed –OR- Risk Assessment Code (RAC) 1 or Fire Safety Deficiency
Code (FSDC) 1.
Degraded—Limited loss of installation/tenant mission capability. Work-arounds to prevent mission
disruption and degradation are often required –OR- Risk Assessment Code (RAC) 2 or Fire Safety
Deficiency Code (FSDC) 2 or 3.
Enhancement—Marginal or no adverse impact to installation/tenant mission capability. Included in this
category are projects that would improve the quality of life in work areas, improve productivity, and any
requirement that does not meet the critical or degraded criteria. (FIM ratings are assigned in accordance
with the USAF/ILE FIM guidance manual based on the user’s input) Minor repair (less than $100K and
maintenance work class projects do not receive a FIM rating. These projects are advocated for funding at
the Air Staff through the Preservation Maintenance Level (PML) Program.
Sustainment— An Air Staff program that identifies and advocates funding for day-to-day and recurring
maintenance and minor repairs accomplished by in-house shops and by contract. FIM projects are
considered to be those projects that are beyond maintenance needs.
