   gram (FMP).

1.7. Program Administration. NGB-CDS-A and ANG/XOOC will share MAJCOM Standardization/
Evaluation functions as outlined in AFI 11-202 Volume 2.
   1.7.1. Flight Crew Information File (FCIF) items will be issued by ANG/XOOC and are applicable to
   all USAF RC-26B aircraft.
   1.7.2. Formal Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Visits (ASEV) will be administered by
   NGB-CDS-A in conjunction with ANG/XOOC. An ASEV will be administered to each RC-26B unit
   within 60-months of the previous ASEV, or within 60-months after a unit’s first operational mission.
   RC-26B ASEV procedures are detailed in Attachment 2.
       1.7.2.1. RC-26B aircrews assigned to NGB-CDS-A and ANG/XOOC will maintain Instructor
       qualification and be certified as Flight Evaluators.
   1.7.3. Staff Assistance Visits. NGB-CDS-A and ANG/XOOC may conduct Staff Assistance Visits
   (SAV) only when formally requested by a unit. SAVs may include any Standardization/Evaluation or
   training related area the unit requests.
       1.7.3.1. Reports, if generated by a SAV, will be informal and for internal use only.

1.8. Unit Standardization/Evaluation Programs. USAF RC-26B aircraft are assigned to units in vari-
ous MAJCOMS. To validate mission effectiveness and document crewmember qualifications throughout
the differing units, CD Program Managers will integrate RC-26B Standardization/Evaluation functions to
align with their local Operations Group Standardization/Evaluation (OGV).

1.9. RC-26B CD Program Manager Duties. RC-26B CD Program Managers will:
   1.9.1. Perform all applicable Squadron Commander duties found in AFI 11-202 Volume 2. Aircrew
   Standardization/Evaluation Program.
   1.9.2. With OG/CC approval, designate in writing the most highly qualified and experienced instruc-
   tors as RC-26B flight examiners (FE). RC-26B FEs work with, but are not assigned to, OGV. Local
   RC-26B programs may have more than one FE per crew position.
   1.9.3. Participate in OGV trend programs only for discrepancies common to both RC-26B and local
   PAA (i.e. instrument procedures). A separate trend program is not required.

1.10. RC-26B Flight Examiner Procedures.
   1.10.1. RC-26B Flight Examiners are authorized to administer evaluations to crewmembers assigned
   to other RC-26B units, regardless of parent unit MAJCOM.
   1.10.2. Flight examiners will be current and qualified when administering evaluations.
6                                                                 AFI11-2RC-26BV2 31 AUGUST 2005


    1.10.3. Flight examiners will pre-brief the examinee on the conduct, purpose, requirements of the
    evaluation, and all applicable evaluation criteria. Flight examiners will then evaluate the examinee in
    each graded area.
    1.10.4. Flight examiners will normally not evaluate personnel they have primarily trained or recom-
    mended for upgrade evaluation.
    1.10.5. Unless otherwise specified, flight examiners may conduct the evaluation in any crew position/
    seat which will best enable the flight examiner to observe the examinee’s performance.
    1.10.6. Note discrepancies and deviations from prescribed tolerances and performance criteria during
    the evaluation. Compare the examinee’s performance with the tolerances provided in the grading cri-
    teria and assign an appropriate grade for each area.
    1.10.7. An evaluation will not be changed to a training mission to avoid documenting substandard
    performance, nor will a training mission be changed to an evaluation.
    1.10.8. The judgment of the flight examiner, guidance provided in AFI 11-202 Volume 2 Aircrew
    Standardization/Evaluation Program, and this instruction will be the determining factors in assigning
    an overall grade. The flight examiner will thoroughly critique all aspects of the flight. During the cri-
    tique, the flight examiner will review the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades
    assigned, and any additional training required.
    1.10.9. In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the flight examiner will determine additional
    training requirements. Normally, additional training should not be accomplished on the same flight.
       1.10.9.1. Immediately notify the examinee’s RC-26B Program Manager, if available, when less
       than Q-1 performance is observed.
       1.10.9.2. Rechecks will normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the one who
       administered the original evaluation.

1.11. Evaluations.
    1.11.1. Flight evaluations will be conducted on a dedicated training sortie and not scheduled during
    an operational mission. Photo targets for evaluations may be actual Law Enforcement Agency (LEA)
    support requests, but the LEA may not be on the aircraft for the evaluation. No-Notice or SPOT eval-
    uations may be conducted during operational missions, but will not interfere with mission accom-
    plishment.
    1.11.2. Conduct evaluations at the frequency prescribed in AFI 11-202, Volume 2, Aircrew Standard-
    ization/Evaluation Program.
    1.11.3. Pilots qualified in more than one MDS aircraft must receive an instrument evaluation in the
    RC-26B.

1.12. Use of AF IMT 3862, Aircrew Evaluation Worksheet. Units will overprint AF IMT 3862 (or a
suitable substitute), using the examples at Attachment 3 or Attachment 4, to use as an evaluation work-
sheet. Copy each title, area number, and text (in the order illustrated), and shading to the appropriate
blocks. Units may add special interest items and/or local evaluation requirements. In-flight, use the work-
sheet to ensure all required areas are evaluated. Record positive and negative trend information and air-
crew member’s performance. File the worksheet or draft copy of the AF IMT 8, Certificate of Aircrew
AFI11-2RC-26BV2 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                             7


Qualification, in the aircrew member’s Flight Evaluation Folder (FEF) immediately after the flight evalu-
ation as a temporary record of the evaluation results. Maintain until the finished AF IMT 8, Certificate of
Aircrew Qualification, is added to the FEF, then discard.

1.13. Grading Policies.
   1.13.1. The overall qualification level awarded an evaluation is based on performance during both the
   flight and ground phases. This grade should be awarded only after all evaluation requirements have
   been completed and given due consideration.
   1.13.2. To receive a qualified grade on an evaluation, the aircrew member must satisfy the criteria set
   forth for that evaluation and demonstrate ability to operate the aircraft and equipment safely and effec-
   tively during all phases of an evaluation.
   1.13.3. Use the grading criteria in Chapter 5 of this instruction to grade areas accomplished during
   an evaluation.
       1.13.3.1. The flight examiner must grade the areas listed as “required” in Chapter 5 of this
       instruction.
       1.13.3.2. The flight examiner may grade any area accomplished during an evaluation if perfor-
       mance in that area impacts the specific evaluation accomplished or safety of flight.
       1.13.3.3. When in-flight evaluation of a required area is not possible, the area may be verbally
       evaluated. Flight examiners will make every effort to evaluate all required areas in-flight before
       resorting to this provision. Document the reasons and type of alternative method used in the com-
       ments section of the AF IMT 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification. All Critical areas must be
       accomplished in-flight.
       1.13.3.4. Grading criteria tolerances assume smooth air and stable aircraft conditions. Minor
       momentary deviations are acceptable, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and
       such deviations do not jeopardize flight safety. Consider cumulative deviations when determining
       the overall grade.
       1.13.3.5. For pilots only, when grading criteria recommend that airspeed control be evaluated, and
       the flight manual lists only minimum/maximum/recommended airspeeds for that area, the exam-
       inee will brief the desired airspeed.
   1.13.4. Flight examiners will use the grading criteria in this instruction to assist in determining proper
   grades. Examiner judgment will determine the overall grade.
       1.13.4.1. An instructor or flight examiner who is graded Q-2 or Q-3 on any evaluation will not
       perform instructor or examiner duties until the required training is complete and documented.

1.14. Grading System. NOTE: This paragraph is for reference only and duplicates information in AFI
11-202 Volume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, allowing the evaluator a single-source
instruction to conduct an evaluation. When a conflict occurs, use AFI 11-202 Volume 2, Aircrew Stan-
dardization/Evaluation Program.
   1.14.1. Overall Qualification Levels.
       1.14.1.1. Qualification Level 1 (Q-1). The aircrew member demonstrated desired performance
       and knowledge of procedures, equipment, and directives within tolerances specified in this
8                                                                 AFI11-2RC-26BV2 31 AUGUST 2005


       instruction. Qualification Level 1 will be awarded when no discrepancies were noted and may be
       awarded when discrepancies are noted if:
           1.14.1.1.1. The discrepancies resulted in no more than a “Q-” grade being given in any
           area(s).
           1.14.1.1.2. In the judgment of the flight examiner, none of the discrepancies preclude award-
           ing of an overall Qualification Level 1.
           1.14.1.1.3. All discrepancies noted during the evaluation were cleared during the debrief of
           that evaluation.
       1.14.1.2. Qualification Level 2 (Q-2). The aircrew member demonstrated the ability to perform
       duties safely, but:
           1.14.1.2.1. There were one or more area(s) where additional training was assigned.
           1.14.1.2.2. A non-critical area grade of “U” was awarded.
           1.14.1.2.3. In the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on performance
           in one or more areas.
       1.14.1.3. Qualification Level 3 (Q-3). The aircrew member demonstrated an unacceptable level of
       safety, performance or knowledge.
           1.14.1.3.1. A grade of “U” awarded in a critical area requires an overall “Q-3” for the evalua-
           tion.
           1.14.1.3.2. An overall “Q-3” can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight examiner, there
           is justification based on performance in one or more areas.
       1.14.1.4. The flight examiner will indicate all appropriate restriction(s) and additional training on
       the AF IMT 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification.
    1.14.2. A “Q” is the desired level of performance. The examinee demonstrated a satisfactory knowl-
    edge of all required information, performed aircrew duties within the prescribed tolerances and
    accomplished the assigned mission.
       1.14.2.1. A “Q-” indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area tasks, but
       requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner. Deviations from
       established standards must not exceed the prescribed “Q-” tolerances or jeopardize flight safety.
       1.14.2.2. Assign a “U” area grade for any breach of flight discipline, performance outside allow-
       able parameters or deviations from prescribed procedures/ tolerances that adversely affected mis-
       sion accomplishment or compromised flight safety. An examinee receiving an area grade of “U”
       normally requires additional training. When, in the judgment of the flight examiner, additional
       training will not constructively improve examinee’s performance, it is not required. In this case,
       the flight examiner must thoroughly debrief the examinee.
    1.14.3. Boldface. Grade Boldface either “Q” or “U.”
    1.14.4. Critical Areas. Critical areas require adequate accomplishment by the aircrew member in
    order to successfully achieve the mission objectives. If an aircrew member receives an unqualified
    grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will also be unqualified. Critical areas
AFI11-2RC-26BV2 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                            9

U                          Exceeded Q- limits

2.3. Pilot INSTM/QUAL Evaluations. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to operate the air-
craft and accomplish all pilot or copilot duties safely and effectively in accordance with the applicable
flight manuals, regulations, and directives. All initial and recurring evaluations include a qualification and
instrument evaluation. To the maximum extent possible, INSTM evaluations will include approaches at
airfields other than home field.

2.4. Pilot MSN Profiles. Use tactical scenarios that are realistic and practical to satisfy the requirements
of this evaluation. The FE will develop a scenario based on the profiles below. Both Photo Reconnais-
sance and Surveillance procedures should be evaluated on all mission evaluations. MSN evaluations
should be flown using the unit’s tactics. Exceptions to the minimum number of targets are permitted for
specialized missions. Successful acquisition of targets will be based on the requested intelligence infor-
mation and/or FE judgment. FEs may assign targets in flight. Targets not acquired due to adverse weather
or verified sensor malfunctions will not be charged against the crew.
     2.4.1. Photo Reconnaissance. A minimum of three targets will be assigned and successfully photo-
     graphed or video recorded for completion of the flight check. At least one target must be a route line
     for pilot steering using the Cockpit Display Unit (CDU) during the photograph pass.
     2.4.2. Surveillance Evaluation. A minimum of three ground areas of interest will be assigned,
     acquired, and video recorded for successful completion of the flight check. One target will be an area
     or structure and one target will be a moving vehicle. VHS recording of all targets is required if VTR is
     functional.

                                     INSTRUCTOR EVALUATIONS

4.1. Instructor (INSTR) Evaluation: Instructor evaluations will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202 Vol-
ume 2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program. Flight evaluations will include a thorough evalua-
tion of the examinee’s instructor knowledge and ability. This is an evaluation in which the examinee must
demonstrate ability to instruct at least one item from each type of evaluation category (Instrument / Qual-
ification / Mission). Except for requirements delineated in. Table 2.2. for pilots and Table 3.1. for MSOs,
specific profiles and/or events will be determined by the flight examiner. All subsequent evaluations (for
example, Instrument/Qualification, Mission) will include instructor portions during the evaluations. This
may include a demonstration or a briefing of a maneuver or procedure. In all cases the instructor will be
required to perform at the instructor versus the basic level. Accomplish initial instructor evaluations on
actual instructional missions whenever possible. When students are not available, the flight examiner may
serve as the student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.
     4.1.1. Instructor grading criteria is presented in paragraph 5.4.

4.2. Flight Examiner Objectivity Evaluation: (Optional)
     4.2.1. An FE objectivity evaluation is a flight/EPE critique objectivity evaluation administered to a
     unit FE, or FE candidate, who is administering an evaluation. Overall rating for this type of an evalu-
     ation will be either qualified (Q-1) or unqualified (Q-3).
     4.2.2. A qualified rating (Q-1) indicates that the FE complied with HHQ and local stan/eval direc-
     tives, properly briefed and debriefed the examinee, correctly identified discrepancies, awarded the
     correct grade for each evaluated area, awarded the appropriate overall grade and, if required, assigned
     appropriate additional training.
     4.2.3. An unqualified rating (Q-3) will be awarded when, in the FE’s judgment, the candidate failed
     to satisfy the requirements of paragraph 4.2.2. above. The OG/CC or CD Program Manager will deter-
     mine the status of the candidate receiving an unqualified FE objectivity evaluation as applicable.
     4.2.4. FE objectivity grading criteria will be defined by local unit OGV.
     4.2.5. These evaluations do not fulfill the requirement of periodic evaluations required by this instruc-
     tion. FE objectivity evaluations will be documented on an AF IMT 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualifi-
     cation.

                                        GRADING CRITERIA

5.1. General Information:
   5.1.1. The grading criteria in this chapter define the areas that need to be evaluated for specific eval-
   uations. Sections include general, mission, instructor, and FE objectivity grading criteria.
   5.1.2. Areas marked (P) are for pilots/copilots only; areas marked (MSO) are for MSOs only. All

                 AIRCREW STANDARDIZATION/EVALUATION VISIT (ASEV):

A2.1. Purpose. ASEV teams validate unit Stan/Eval and training processes and ensure standardization
among flying units.
     A2.1.1. An ASEV will be administered to each RC-26B unit within 60-months of the previous ASEV,
     or within 60-months after a unit’s first operational mission.
     A2.1.2. The ASEV will be administered by NGB-CDS-A, in conjunction with ANG/XOOC. The
     ASEV team will consist of current and qualified RC-26B flight examiners in both pilot and MSO crew
     positions.
     A2.1.3. NGB-CDS-A will designate the ASEV team chief and may request augmentee support from
     RC-26B field units.

A2.2. Notification procedures. NGB-CDS-A will send a formal notification message or memorandum
to the unit, with an info copy to ANG/XOOC, 60-days before the visit. The intent of the message is to
confirm the dates of the visit and inform the unit of the scope of the evaluation and support requested.
NGB-CDS-A will communicate any Special Interest Items (SII) in this notification message.

A2.3. Conduct of ASEV.
     A2.3.1. ASEV Testing (25% of rating). The ASEV team will administer a 25-question closed book
     examination and a Boldface/CAPs examination to all available personnel, in the grade of O-5 and
     below, who are current and qualified to fly unsupervised in unit aircraft.
        A2.3.1.1. The ASEV closed book test and Boldface/CAPs examinations may be used to satisfy
        testing requirements for flight evaluations.
        A2.3.1.2. ASEV tests will be derived from the RC-26B MQF.
        A2.3.1.3. Separate pilot and MSO tests will be administered by the ASEV team.
        A2.3.1.4. Minimum passing score is 85% for the closed book test and 100% for the Boldface/
        CAPs examination.
        A2.3.1.5. Crewmembers failing ASEV closed book tests, or Boldface/CAPs examinations, will
        be placed in supervised status until successful completion of unit closed book examinations.
     A2.3.2. Flight Evaluations (50% of rating). ASEV team members may administer evaluations to any
     crewmember that is current and qualified. Emphasis will be to evaluate instructors and flight evalua-
     tors. The total number of evaluations and type will be at the discretion of the ASEV team chief.
        A2.3.2.1. The ASEV team will complete an AF IMTs 8, Certificates of Aircrew Qualification, for
        all ASEV evaluations prior to departure.
        A2.3.2.2. At the unit commander’s discretion, and with ASEV evaluator’s approval, evaluations
        administered by ASEV flight examiners may be credited toward periodic evaluation requirements,
        if requisites have been accomplished.
AFI11-2RC-26BV2 31 AUGUST 2005                                                                            33


   A2.3.3. Stan/Eval Program (25% of rating). All unit Stan/Eval, Training, Tactics, Safety, and Aircrew
   Resource Management System programs are subject to inspection.

A2.4. ASEV Grading. At the conclusion of the visit a unit-level overall ASEV grade will be awarded.
The ASEV team chief will provide feedback (oral or written) to the unit commander and staff. In addition,
the ASEV team chief will release an ASEV written report following review and endorsement by
NGB-CDS-A. The ASEV team chief will provide a copy of the ASEV written report to NGB-CDS-A,
ANG/XOOC, the inspected unit’s TAG, Counterdrug Task Force/CC, Wing/CC and OG/CC.
   A2.4.1. Individual programs will be awarded a grade using the following scale:
       A2.4.1.1. Outstanding: Program exceeds all requirements with no significant discrepancies noted.
       A2.4.1.2. Excellent: Program exceeds most requirements with few deviations noted.
       A2.4.1.3. Satisfactory: Program meets requirements with some deviations noted.
       A2.4.1.4. Marginal: Program meets most requirements with significant discrepancies noted.
       A2.4.1.5. Unsatisfactory: Major discrepancies noted that degrade program effectiveness.
   A2.4.2. If a “Marginal” or “Unsatisfactory” rating is awarded in any sub area (Aircrew Testing, Flight
   Evaluations, or Stan/Eval Program), the highest possible overall rating is “Satisfactory”.
   A2.4.3. If an overall “Marginal” or “Unsatisfactory” rating is awarded, the report will identify those
   areas not in compliance and include required improvements. Units will report corrective action to
   NGB-CDS-A and ANG/XOOC within 90-days after receiving the final report. This report will be in
   the form of an official memorandum signed by the unit’s operations group commander.
