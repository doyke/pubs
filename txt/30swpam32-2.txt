                                 MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES

1.1. General. The 30th Space Wing will provide maintenance and repair, refuse collection and
disposal, pest control, and fire and police protection for your assigned unaccompanied housing
(UH). Your responsibilities are those of a Good Neighbor. The high density living conditions
associated with life in the dormitories dictates that your room, YOUR HOME, be maintained

standards contained in AFI32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing Management, installation policies,
and the contents of this pamphlet. As a dormitory resident, you are a key contributor to ensuring
your living conditions are constantly improved. Please help the 30th Space Wing build and

     maintaining compliance with those standards.
     1.2.3. Entertain residents’ proposals and plans to enhance livability of the dormitories.
     1.2.4. Identify irritants that detract from the livability of the dormitories and make
     recommendations to the Command Chief, First Sergeant’s Council and Airman Dormitory
     Leaders.
     1.2.5. The members will keep their units informed of the desires and complaints of
     occupants and serve as a communications channel between dormitory occupants and the
     Airman Dormitory Leaders.
     1.2.6. Propose agenda items in advance for each monthly meeting and email them out to
     dormitory residents to ensure optimum results. Members of the council at the meeting may
     present additional agenda items.
     1.2.7. Post the dormitory council minutes on dormitory bulletin boards and forward a copy
     of the minutes to the Command Chief, First Sergeant’s Council and the Airman Dormitory
     Leaders.
1.3. Room Assignment, Initial Inspection, and Termination. Rooms are assigned according
to AFI32-6005. If a room is not immediately available, arriving personnel may be temporarily
housed in Lodging or a hospitality room. Departing permanent party personnel, on a temporary
basis, may also use hospitality rooms. Every effort will be made to assign a permanent room as
soon as possible.
30SWPAM32-2 7 JANUARY 2012                                                                    7


   1.3.1. Airman Dormitory Leaders will follow the following procedures to ensure new
   arrivals receive a room and the information needed to transition smoothly into their
   dormitory room. Failure to obey these procedures is a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ.
       1.3.1.1. Airman Dormitory Leaders will maintain a file containing the Gains and Losses
       Roster. This roster can be obtained from 30 FSS/FSMPI.
       1.3.1.2. Upon arriving residents will contact the Airman Dormitory Leader’s office to be
       assigned a room on the first duty day after arrival. An AF Form 291, Unaccompanied
       Quarters Assignment/Termination Record, will be initiated on each member when
       assigned a room. This form will also be used to out-process a member from UH.
       1.3.1.3. Each resident will fill out an AF Form 4422, Sex Offender Disclosure and
       Acknowledgement, prior to being assigned a permanent dormitory room.
       1.3.1.4. Airman Dormitory Leaders will accomplish and AF Form 594, Application and
       Authorization to Start, Stop, or Change BAQ, for every UH assignment to include: E1-E3
       and E4 with more than 3 years of service IAW AFI 32-6005, Unaccompanied Housing
       Management.
       1.3.1.5. Airman Dormitory Leaders will provide occupants with a resident brochure
       identifying applicable AF, MAJCOM, and local base standards.
1.4. Initial Inspection. The Airman Dormitory Leader will escort the resident (temporary or

the resident. At this time room condition will be identified and documented on our locally
created, Unaccompanied Housing Quarters Condition Inspection Report, as well appliance and
furniture condition which will be documented on AF Form 228, Furnishing Custody Receipt and
Condition Report. The resident will then have 3 days to provide additional discrepancies to the
Airman Dormitory Leaders. Any items noted thereafter will be the occupant’s responsibility to
fix or replace prior to clearing the dorm room. Once all in-processing is complete, the resident
will sign an acknowledgement receipt.
1.5. Termination. When ready to terminate your permanent quarters, contact the Airmen
Dormitory Leaders at least 30 days in advance. You will be advised of clearance requirements
and necessary preparations for the final inspection. Remember under federal law, members of the
Armed Forces occupying military housing shall be held liable and accountable for loss or
damage to housing, equipment, or furnishings when caused by abuse or negligence of the
member, or the member’s guests. You may wish to consider buying commercial renters
insurance to protect yourselves from damages. Be sure to read Chapter 7 for more information on
termination of quarter’s procedures.
1.6. Guests. Temporary guests are permitted in your shared modular (MOD) common area if all
occupants of the MOD agree. No guests under the age of 18 are permitted in the dormitory area.
Guests are not allowed to be left in rooms when the occupant is not present. Cohabitation is not
permitted and you shall not allow individuals to sleep overnight in your dorm for any reason.
Failure to obey the terms of this paragraph is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ.
1.7. Maintenance and Repair. The Base Civil Engineer (BCE) has primary responsibility for
performing maintenance on your room and the dormitory campus; however, both you and the
Airman Dormitory Leaders need to stay alert for the maintenance needs of your quarters and the
 8                                                             30SWPAM32-2 7 JANUARY 2012


dormitory in general. When the dormitory or your room needs maintenance, contact the Airman
Dormitory Leaders (Monday through Friday, 0730 –1630 hrs). When you believe your room or
the dormitory needs urgent or emergency maintenance, and the Airman Dormitory Leaders are
unavailable, please contact the Damage Control Center (DCC) at 606-1856. The CE controller
will determine the status of your request when calling the BCE Service Call Desk.
     1.7.1. Emergency work requests are responded to within 24 hours and work will continue
     until       the emergency is resolved. An emergency work request is defined as a structural,
     utility or mechanical problem that could cause loss of life, loss of property, serious damage,
     or affect your health, safety, security, or the mission. Examples: loss of a utility (electricity,
     gas, heat, water or        sewage).
     1.7.2. Urgent work requests are completed within 7 work days and are accomplished during
     duty hours. An urgent work request is defined as a loss of an isolated utility. Examples: 1)
     one commode in a facility clogged up with one or more still available, 2) A loss of heating or
     cooling in a facility.
     1.7.3. Routine work orders are completed within 30 days. A routine requirement is defined
     as all maintenance, repair or minor construction work, other than emergency or urgent which
     is necessary to maintain and operate a complete and usable facility and to protect it from
     further deterioration/damage. The completion date may be longer if materials must be
     ordered, again performed during duty hours.
1.8. Requesting Self-Help Work. If you wish to conduct a self-help project to improve your
living conditions, an AF Form 332, Base Civil Engineer Work Request, will be required. Contact
your Airman Dormitory Leaders for assistance. No work may be performed until this form has
been approved.
1.9. Refuse Collection and Disposal. Large outside dumpsters are provided in the dormitory
parking areas. Please take all garbage to the dumpster. Refuse must never be allowed to
accumulate in rooms, be placed outside your room door, dayrooms, on balconies or in stairwells.
Please be considerate of your fellow residents and the positive image of Vandenberg AFB.
Please Recycle! Exterior recycling containers are available for paper, aluminum, glass, plastic,
metal and cardboard. Dorm residents are responsible for taking large items that do not fit into
refuse collection and disposal containers to the base landfill. Do not throw any electrical items
into the refuse collection and disposal containers, these items must be taken to bldg 6830. Please
call 6-8438 to schedule an appointment.
1.10. Insect/Wildlife Control. If it should be necessary, the BCE will treat your room before
you move in; however, you must take preventive action to control insects. Keep food in sealed
containers, remove garbage from your quarters regularly, and discard empty paper bags and
boxes. These examples provide insect nesting and breeding areas. Feeding wildlife is strictly
prohibited. Leaving garbage outside your rooms attracts local wildlife causing infestation
problems as well. Initially, members should attempt to resolve minor insect problems with
standard household insect repellant.
1.11. Room Lockouts and Security. Maintain control of your key at all times. If locked out
during duty hours, 0730-1630 hrs M-F, see the Airman Dormitory Leaders for access to your
room. If you are locked out after normal duty hours, contact your supervisor and they will obtain
the master key from the SFS Law Enforcement Desk. A lost key poses a risk to the security of
30SWPAM32-2 7 JANUARY 2012                                                                      9


your room. Your room should always be properly secured; however, as a precaution, your
valuables should be marked and recorded to assist the 30th Space Wing with their recovery. If
you wish to have a record of your valuables maintained in your dormitory file, please complete
an AF Form 1670, Value Property Record Sheet, and return to the Airman Dormitory Leaders.
Social Security Number is not a mandatory field on the form.
1.12. Bay Orderly. Dormitory residents will periodically be responsible for general
maintenance duties throughout the dormitory area. This detail is known as Bay Orderly. Your
Airman Dormitory Leaders and chain of command will provide you direction and notify you of
your responsibilities. These duties will be Monday through Friday, 0730-1630 hrs. See
Attachment 2 for Daily Bay Orderly Duty.
1.13. Appliances and Furniture. All government-furnished appliances and furniture are
inventoried at check-in and when terminating quarters on an AF Form 228. Do not remove any
government appliance or furniture item from your room or from the dayroom. Any missing,
damaged, or broken furniture will be replaced at your expense. Failure to properly complete and
turn in your AF Form 228 will result in you paying for any damaged or missing furniture at
check-out time. Problems with a government-furnished item should be reported to the Airman
Dormitory Leaders as soon as possible so that servicing may be arranged. If you wish to use your
own ―Underwriters Laboratory‖ (UL) approved appliance or furniture, check with the Airman
Dormitory Leaders to be sure it is an authorized appliance or furniture item that conforms to fire
codes and be sure to read Chapter 3 on Fire Protection.
1.14. Utilities, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning. Your assistance in conserving
utility usage is greatly appreciated. Remembering to keep doors and windows closed when
heating and cooling your room, turning off lights and appliances when not needed, and
conserving water are important aspects of environmental stewardship and sound judgment. You
may be required to change the filter in your heater/air conditioner unit (HVAC). You can pick up
filters at the Airman Dormitory Leader’s office. Operate the HVAC unit only when a filter is in
place. Damage to the HVAC system, caused by filters not being changed is costly and could be
the responsibility of the occupant. Remove dust from all vent covers and report any malfunction
of the HVAC system to the Airman Dormitory Leaders during duty hours and the DCC after
duty hours. Do not attempt repairs or adjustments on your own.

                                            Chapter 2

                                 DORMITORY STANDARDS

2.1. General Standards. The dormitory and your room are your home. You should feel
comfortable in this environment. If you do not, you should voice your suggestions for
improvement to the Top Life Dorm Council, Airman Dormitory Leaders or through your chain
of command. If your personal information (rank, duty phone, duty section and marital status)
changes, you must notify the Airman Dormitory Leaders immediately. This entire pamphlet
contains important information that will make your stay in the dormitories more pleasant. The
following establishes the minimum acceptable neat, clean, and orderly standards used throughout
the 30th Space Wing. Be sure to check with your chain of command for additional information.
   2.1.1. Animals/Pets. Pets are not authorized in the dormitories. There are no exceptions.
   Fish no longer than 6 inches are allowed and are limited to a 20-gallon aquarium. Flesh
   eating or poisonous fish are not authorized. Residents are responsible for damage caused by
   the tank.
   2.1.2. Vehicles, Automotive Parts, Maintenance, and Cleaning. Vehicle repairs, oil
   changes, and similar maintenance actions are to be done at a commercial Auto Repair Shop,
   not the dormitory area or associated parking lots. Additionally, vehicle parts (tires, batteries,
   seats, etc.) will not be stored in your dorm room. If you wish, you may wax and vacuum your
   vehicle but only in the parking lots. Please note that non-operational and unregistered
   vehicles are not permitted in the dormitory area.
   2.1.3. Barbecue Grills. Permanent gas barbecue grills are provided for resident use;
   therefore, portable grills are not to be used anywhere in the dormitory area (i.e., balconies,
   common areas, etc). Please be considerate and turn off the gas supply and clean the provided
   grills after each use. Exception: Requests to deviate from this policy may be submitted in
   writing to the Airman Dormitory Leaders for special occasions (i.e., unit organized dorm
   functions requiring additional grills, etc.).
   2.1.4. Room Decoration. Personal decorations are only allowed in your personal room and
   must be neat and in good taste. Picture frames are not required; however, if pictures/posters
   are taped on the walls, damage may result. Any damage caused by the tape must be repaired
   prior to out-processing. Decals, stickers, or posters are not allowed on the outside of the door,
   common areas, windows, or on any furnishings. You are not allowed to leave personal items
   in the common areas.
2.2. Inspections. All units with personnel residing in the dormitories will inspect rooms. The
wing commander has established dormitory inspection standards. Commanders, first sergeants,
and supervisors will periodically inspect your room (at least quarterly) to make sure that it meets
standards and is in good repair. Be sure to check with your chain of command so you understand
the dormitory inspection standards. Distinguished visitors go to the dormitories with regularity,
as your quality of life is an important Air Force issue. Follow the guidelines in the following
paragraphs to better understand minimum standards. Inspections may or may not be announced,
so all rooms must be kept neat, clean, and orderly at all times. Failure to obey the terms of
this paragraph is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ. The Dormitory Inspection Results form can be
found in Attachment 3, Figure A3.1
30SWPAM32-2 7 JANUARY 2012                                                                      11


2.3. Room Interiors.
   2.3.1. Floors and Carpets. Please clean and vacuum weekly. Ensure there is no dirt build-
   up in the corners, behind the doors, or under beds or other furniture. See the Airman
   Dormitory Leaders for use of a carpet shampoo machine when necessary.
   2.3.2. Walls. Walls must be clean and maintained in good repair. Use mild soap and warm
   water       to keep walls clean. Walls should be repaired and repainted as necessary. If
   repairs are not done in an acceptable manner, the member will be charged to have the walls
   professionally repaired and repainted.
   2.3.3. Sink. Remove hair from drain screen after each use. Clean fixtures so they are free of
   dirt, mildew/mold, and water spots. Report leaks to the Airman Dormitory Leaders
   immediately.
   2.3.4. Kitchen. Maintaining the appliances, cabinets, and walls in the kitchen requires
   special attention. Dormitories with kitchens will be cleaned after each use. Clean broiler units
   regularly, as well as top burners, to prevent a fire hazard. Do not use cleaner for ovens that
   are self- cleaning. Please dust the wire framework on the rear of the refrigerator and
   periodically clean the door gasket to improve cooling and extend life of the refrigerator. Do
   not pour grease in the sinks; it will solidify in the pipes, causing damage. Clean walls at
   periodic intervals to prevent surface grease buildup.
   2.3.5. Toilet/Bathing Area. This entire area should be diligently cared for due to the
   potential for bacteria growth. Clean the toilet (inside and out), shower tiles, bathtub, shower
   curtain and overhead vent with a disinfectant cleaner. Do not allow soap scum to build up. If
   stains or residue will not come off, the Airman Dormitory Leaders will ensure the BCE is
   notified. Please pay particular attention to mold/mildew and remove it immediately with a
   proper cleaning solution.
   2.3.6. Linen. You may use the linen provided by the Airman Dormitory Leaders, or you
   may use your own personal linens. All linen must present a neat and clean appearance.
   2.3.7. Under Bed. Items stored must be neatly arranged.
   2.3.8. Furniture. Furniture must be clean and neatly arranged in your room. The furniture
   arrangement cannot prevent easy exiting in-case of emergencies. Items on top of tables,
   dressers and desks must be neat and dusted.
   2.3.9. Windows. Clean the inside of windows and the outside on first floor windows only.
   Channels and windowsills also need to be kept clean. Report damaged or missing screens to
   the Airman Dormitory Leaders immediately.
2.4. Room Exteriors. Only room numbers and approved message plates may be mounted on
your door. Your room must present a professional outward appearance. Patio and balcony areas
should be swept as needed. Shift worker signs can be obtained from the Airman Dormitory
Leaders.
2.5. Supplies. The Airman Dormitory Leaders can provide cleaning supplies for individual
resident’s use. Please contact him/her for information on the proper handling and disposal of
issued/personal unused cleaning supplies.
 12                                                        30SWPAM32-2 7 JANUARY 2012


2.6. Leave or Extended TDY. When leaving your quarters for extended periods of time (over
14 days), inform the Airman Dormitory Leaders. Make sure you move your vehicles to the
deployed parking area, located at LRS vehicle dispatch, during your leave or extended TDY.
Please ensure you complete the 30 SW Deployment Checklist prior to deploying. This checklist
is designed to make sure your quarters are taken care of while you are gone.
2.7. Damage to Quarters. Room damage not recorded during the initial inspection that is
beyond reasonable wear and tear is your responsibility. Any repairs or replacements that you
elect to do on your own must meet Air Force standards. For damages not corrected within Air
Force standards or a reasonable time frame, as determined by the Airman Dormitory Leaders, the
Air Force may elect to make the repairs and bill you. The Airman Dormitory Leaders can explain
your options to repair or replace damaged items, or the methods of reimbursement to the
government.
2.8. Laundry Facilities. Washing with full loads is recommended to conserve energy, but be
sure not to over-load washers or dryers. Overloading causes damage to the machines. Check
pockets for items before washing and drying to prevent inadvertent damage and clean washer
and dryer lint traps to ensure optimal machine performance. The washers/dryers are maintained
by contract. Laundry should not be left unattended. Any laundry left unattended will be disposed
of accordingly. If you have a problem with your laundry facility, contact the Airman Dormitory
Leaders.
2.9. Environment. Several reminders: Trash, engine oils, engine coolants, car grease, and other
similar products must never be poured into the drainage system or on the ground. Automotive
batteries and tires must be properly disposed of through recycling programs. Recycle items:
Aluminum, paper, glass, plastic, metals and cardboard are to be placed in the blue recycling bins
(located next to refuse dumpster).
2.10. Smoking. Smoking is ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED. Smoking is not allowed in rooms
and common areas to include dayrooms, hallways, stairwells, and bathrooms. Smoking will be
allowed only at the outside designated smoking area. Failure to obey the terms of this paragraph
is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ.
2.11. Alcohol. If you are under 21 you will NOT drink or possess alcohol in the dorms. NO
EXCEPTIONS! If you are assigned a roommate in the MOD Dorms who is under 21, no alcohol
is permitted in the kitchen refrigerator. In this instance, if you are 21+ years of age, you must
store your alcohol in your personal room. Distributing alcohol to minors in any form is a crime.
Failure to obey the terms of this paragraph is a violation of Art 92, UCMJ.
2.12. Bicycles. If you choose, you may store your bike in your room. Bicycles will not be left or
stored in common areas, dayrooms, hallways, under stairwells, on walkway balconies, or chained
to railings. Any damage to your bicycle, to include lock removal, will be your responsibility.
Bicycles that appear abandoned will be tagged and turned in as abandoned property to the
property disposal officer.
2.13. Gambling. Gambling is strictly prohibited. Failure to obey this provision is a violation of
Article 92 of the UCMJ.
2.14. Roof Access. Access to the roof is not necessary and not permitted.
30SWPAM32-2 7 JANUARY 2012                                                                       13


                                            Chapter 3

                                     FIRE PROTECTION

3.1. General. If a fire occurs in the dormitory, immediately notify the base Fire Department at
911. Give the fire alarm operator your name, dormitory number, and street if known. Do not
hang up until you are told to do so. All fires must be reported.
3.2. Fire Evacuation Plan. Please review the dormitory fire evacuation plan for each building
found on bulletin boards and in each MOD dorm. It shows both primary and alternate routes of
escape in the event of a fire. Ensure that your furnishings are arranged so that they do not
obstruct exits. Any questions on fire prevention should be directed to the base fire department.
3.3. Fire Extinguishers. Fire extinguishers are located throughout your dormitory and should
not be used for any purpose other than fire fighting in an emergency. Notify the Airman
Dormitory Leaders if you notice an extinguisher is over or under charged, or has been discharged
or damaged. Failure to obey this provision is a violation of Article 92 of the UCMJ.
3.4. Smoke Detectors. All occupants must evacuate the dormitory if an alarm sounds.
Tampering with alarm call boxes or firefighting equipment is a serious offense, punishable under
the UCMJ. DO NOT SELF-TEST YOUR DETECTOR OR REMOVE IT FOR ANY REASON.
Articles will not be mounted on or attached to any fire protection device, wiring, or smoke
detector. Combustible material must be kept a minimum of 18 inches from light fixtures, heat, or
smoke detectors, and heating appliances.
3.5. Flammable Storage. STORAGE OF FLAMABLES IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED. The only
flammable liquids allowed are for cigarette lighter refilling or cosmetics (nail polish or polish
remover). Evidence of burnt candles/incense qualifies as a violation of the Fire Protection rules.
Failure to obey the terms of this paragraph is a violation of Article 92, UCMJ.
3.6. Space Heaters. Electric heaters must be listed by the Underwriter's Laboratories (UL). All
portable electric heaters will be equipped with a tilt switch and not be left unattended. These
heaters will be plugged into the wall outlets only. They cannot be plugged into a power strip or
other devices. Electric heaters must be kept at least 36 inches away from any objects and
unplugged when not in use.
3.7. Cooking Appliances. Cooking in other than the appliances listed below is only permitted
in the shared kitchen area. The only electric cooking appliances allowed in dorm rooms are:
toasters, crock pots, vegetable steamers, coffee pots, blenders, mixers, rice cookers, and
microwave ovens using less than 1,600 watts each. Appliances must be placed on a non-
combustible surface and have the UL seal of approval on each appliance. Never leave appliances
unattended while cooking; it’s the number one cause of fires in homes. Should a grease fire
occur, cover the burning pan with a lid, turn off the appliance, and call the Fire Department at
911. NEVER USE WATER ON A GREASE FIRE AND DON'T ATTEMPT TO MOVE THE
PAN. The kitchen exhaust fan filter should be cleaned often to prevent the accumulation of
grease. Appliances that draw high electrical current including but not limited to electric broilers,
tabletop electric grills, electric woks, hot plates, toaster ovens, and convection ovens, or any
pressurized gas burners with open flames for cooking or heating, etc., are not allowed in the
dormitories.

3.8. Extension Cords. Extension cords must be of continuous length without splices and must
have the UL seal of approval. Position your cords in a manner that will not pose a tripping
hazard. Extension cords will not be secured to walls, placed under floor coverings, or through
holes in walls, floors, or ceilings. Multiple head or cobra head type extension cords are not
authorized, nor are multiple outlet adapters. Do not daisy chain extension cord or power strips
(only one extension device per outlet).
3.9. Heat Producing Devices. Coffee pots, hot air popcorn poppers, irons, hair dryers and
curling irons must be unplugged when not in use.

                                     GOOD NEIGHBORS

5.1. General Occupant Courtesy. It’s not easy for people from different walks of life to live
together in close quarters. Courtesy and respect reduces tension among dormitory residents.
5.2. Quiet Time. Quiet hours are observed 24 hours a day in the dormitory area. If stereos or
other noise can be heard outside your room or through the walls, it’s too loud. Excessive noise is
the primary complaint received by Security Forces. Some of our dorm residents work shifts and
are sleeping during the day, so please be considerate. Don't assume that your neighbors enjoy the
same type of music you enjoy and please keep the volume down.
5.3. Parties and Social Gatherings. Parties and other social gatherings are permitted; however,
take into consideration that other dormitory residents may be asleep. Please clean up after
yourselves. This includes returning dayroom furniture to its original position when done and
disposing of your trash properly and promptly. As an alternative, the Collocated Club is available
for parties; reservations can be made through the applicable agencies.
5.4. Recreation Vehicles, Motorcycle Trailers, Jet Skis, Wave Runners, etc. Recreational
vehicles are not to be stored in the dormitory parking lot. Outdoor Recreation, located in Bldg.

desk or crouch in a corner. Do not rush outdoors during the shaking, watch for falling or sliding
objects, and move away from windows.
6.7. Sleeping Signs. Shift Personnel will only display signs if they are on a break or night shift
and do not want to be disturbed. When maintenance workers need to perform routine
maintenance in a shift worker’s room, every effort will be made to avoid disturbing the occupant
during sleep periods; however, there may be occasions when mandatory or emergency work
must be accomplished and a shift worker may consequently be disturbed.
6.8. Wi-Fi. Free Wi-Fi is available in the following dormitory areas: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd floor

                   TERMINATION OF UNACCOMPANIED HOUSING

7.1. 30-Day Notice. Orders are not required for termination inspection. Thirty days notice is
required prior to your desired termination date (short notice PCS accepted). Notify the Airmen
Dormitory Leaders who will schedule a date for an inspection. The Airman Dormitory Leaders

THE OCCUPANT.
7.2. Final Inspection. The Airman Dormitory Leaders will assess the condition of assigned
rooms/shared common space and furnishings as compared to discrepancies noted at the initial
inspection to determine damages or loss. You are responsible for accomplishing all cleaning
tasks that are directed by the Airman Dormitory Leaders. All final-out inspections will be by
appointment only. All common areas, private rooms, and appliances must be cleaned and be in
inspection order when checking out. Any changes/damage made to your room must be
returned/repaired back to its original state (i.e., excessive holes on in walls, wall painting,
furniture alterations, etc.). Minor items may be corrected during the final inspection. If you fail
your inspection, you must arrange another inspection date with the Airman Dormitory Leaders.
The re-inspection will be at the earliest mutually acceptable time to minimize delay of resident
departure.

                          DORMITORY INSPECTION RESULTS

A3.1. Who Inspects and Rates Quarters. The installation commander determines who
inspects and rates quarters. Self-inspection by dorm residents is authorized. Inspections generally
are scheduled and announced, but may be no notice. Each Installation establishes inspection
standards and designates authorized inspectors.
A3.2. Inspection. Installations must ensure all occupants are briefed on inspection criteria,
frequency, and who is designated to inspect their rooms. The focus for the inspection of quarters
is safety and health.
A3.3. Category Definitions and Frequency of Inspections:
   A3.3.1. Category A (Outstanding). Cleanliness and neatness exceeds standards.
   A2.3.2. Category B (Satisfactory). Meets Standards.
   A2.3.3. Category C (Unsatisfactory). Does not meet standards. Report quarters not meeting
   safety and health standards to the member’s first sergeant and establish a re-inspection
   schedule to ensure standards are met and maintained.
A3.4. Rooms Displaying “SHIFT WORKER” Signs. Establish inspection schedules to
accommodate occupants work/sleep schedules.
A3.5. Dormitory Inspection Checklist. Use the Dormitory Inspection Checklist Figure A2.1
to complete inspections.
