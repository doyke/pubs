                                            Chapter 1

 CHARACTERIZATION UNIT (CU) & EXPLOITATION UNIT (EU) INTERACTIONS

1.1. General. The 25th Operational Weather Squadron (25 OWS), and the 377th Maintenance
Squadron Weather Flight (377 MXS/MXOW) are the official weather information agencies for
KAFB, New Mexico. These agencies provide weather information in support of the 377 ABW,
the 58th Special Operations Wing (58 SOW), and subordinate units and units assigned, attached,
or supported by KAFB. The 377 MXS/MXOW is commonly referred to as the Weather Flight
(WF) and is the focal point for all weather-related issues.
   1.1.1. The 25 OWS is considered the characterization unit. Characterization encompasses
   the “collect, analyze and predict” weather core competencies. Characterization depends on
   Air Force Weather’s ability to collect accurate data, correctly analyze that data, and use the
   results to produce a coherent picture of the present and future state of the air and space
   environment.
   1.1.2. 377 MXS/MXOW is considered the exploitation unit. Exploitation is the ability to
   minimize the impact of environmental threats to friendly forces while simultaneously
   capitalizing on environmental conditions that maximize the operational advantage over
   enemy forces. Exploitation units tailor the characterization provided by the characterization
   unit. Tailoring is the extraction of data that is pertinent to a specific mission profile from the
   overall characterization of the air and space environment. Tailoring does not mean changing
   the characterization. To the greatest extent possible exploitation units will use the
   characterized data provided to them.
1.2. Concept of Operations.
   1.2.1. The 25 OWS at Davis Monthan Air Force Base (AFB), Arizona, provides regional and
   operational-level weather products and information to Air Force and Army units in the
   Southwest region of the Continental United States (CONUS).
   1.2.2. Meteorological Watch (METWATCH). The 25 OWS performs a continuous
   METWATCH for KAFB. METWATCH is a deliberate, continuous process for monitoring
   terrestrial weather or the space environment in an area or region. The purpose of a
   METWATCH is to identify when and where observed conditions significantly diverge from
   forecast conditions, determine courses of action to update or amend a forecast product or
   group of products, and notify designated agencies.
   1.2.3. The WF is the primary source of tailored weather services in support of the 377 ABW,
   the 58 SOW, subordinate units and units assigned, attached, or supported by KAFB and
   transient aircrews. The WF will make every effort to ensure that mission-limiting weather is
   anticipated and exploited, and that safety and Resource Protection (RP) are maintained.
1.3. Responsibilities.
   1.3.1. General responsibilities of the 25 OWS and WF are outlined in AFI 15-128, para 4.1.
       1.3.1.1. The 25 OWS has ultimate responsibility for issuing Terminal Aerodrome
       Forecasts (TAF) (excluding KAFB, which is issued by the National Weather Service
       [NWS]), Weather Warnings, Watches, and Advisories, within its Area of Responsibility
 6                                                   KIRTLANDAFBI15-101 3 APRIL 2013


        (AOR) as well as provide weather briefings to transient aircrews during 377
        MXS/MXOW non-duty hours. This allows the 377 MXS/MXOW to focus on tailored
        customer support to areas such as Flight Weather Briefing support, Mission Execution
        Forecasts (MEF), deployment briefings, and other specialized weather support.
        1.3.1.2. The WF issues all observed advisories and warnings when the WF is open.
        1.3.1.3. The WF will create Mission Weather Products (MWPs) that fuse theater scale
        products with local mission requirements to enable the direct inject of weather impacts
        into warfighter planning and/or execution. Upon request, the WF will provide flight
        weather briefings and operational weather support for the 932 AW. The WF will also
        provide flight weather briefings for the 58 SOW and transient aircrews IAW the WF duty
        priorities listed in Table 1.1.
     1.3.2. KAFB Installation Data Page. The 25 OWS and KAFB WF will coordinate and
     maintain a KAFB Installation Data Page detailing TAF specification and amendment criteria,
     Watch, Warning and Advisory (WWA) thresholds, desired lead times, mission impacts, unit
     information, JET back-up contacts and local outage back-up information.
     1.3.3. Eyes Forward & Collaboration. The KAFB WF will act as the eyes forward for the
     OWS by relaying significant, time-sensitive meteorological information not found in coded
     meteorological reports to the 25 OWS to assist in forecast operations.
1.4. Duty Priorities. 377 MXS/MXOW Duty Priorities. IAW AFMAN 15-129V2, para
1.3.3.1, the WF has created the following duty priorities based on 377 ABW mission
requirements.

 14           Provide other weather products, information, and weather briefings
 15           Weather Functional Training
 16           Accomplish Administrative Tasks
1.5. Hours of Operation & Contact Information.
      1.5.1. WF. Normal airfield and mission services hours of operations are Monday-Friday
      from 0600L-2100L. The WF is closed on Federal holidays, and other dates, as deemed
      appropriate by the 377 ABW/Commander (377 ABW/CC) or the Chief, Airfield Operations
      Flight (377 MXS/MXO). The WF will remain open past published hours when directed by
      the 377 ABW/CC or 377 MXS/MXOW Flight Chief. In addition, WF personnel will be on
      duty when SWAP have been activated as outlined in para 2.8.2.
         1.5.1.1. A web-based aircrew-briefing terminal is located in base operations, Flight
         Planning Room. This briefing terminal allows aircrews to self-brief or schedule a flight
         weather briefing from the 25 OWS
         1.5.1.2. Prior to closing the station, the WF technician is responsible for contacting the
         25 OWS, 58 SOW Wing Operations Center, (WOC), base operations (when open), and
         the 377 ABW Command Post (CP). The weather technician will not leave the work
         center until all available agencies have been notified.
      1.5.2. 25 OWS. Hours of operation are 24/7, 365 days a year.
      1.5.3. Contact Information
         1.5.3.1. WF (505) 846-9707/9722 / DSN 246-9707/9722
         1.5.3.2. WF Alternate Operating Location (AOL). (505) 846-9482 / DSN 246-9482
         1.5.3.3. PMSV 342.3 MHz
         1.5.3.4. 25 OWS (520) 228-7655 / DSN 228-7655 / Toll free (877) 451-8367x1
1.6. Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP). Continuity of support to the installation is
susceptible to communication outages at the 25 OWS and WF.
      1.6.1. WF COOP and WF AOL. In the event of a building evacuation, the WF will move
      to building 1017 (58 SOW Operations Bldg), basement floor, room C10, Comm (505) 846-
      9482 / DSN 246-9482. WF members will follow duty-specific Standard Operating
      Procedures (SOPs) and evacuation checklists and resume services at the AOL as soon as
      possible. The flight will notify the KAFB forecaster, continue operational support and
      resume eyes forward responsibilities for the OWS. If access to Albuquerque Sunport
      (KABQ) observations is lost, manual equipment will be used to take observations. Most WF
      services/support will be provided, but will require a case-by-case assessment depending on
      communication line status, equipment status, etc. Expect most services to be somewhat
      degraded (weather products, pilot briefings, etc.) due to limited facilities and loss of
      dedicated data services, including various data types (meteorological satellite [METSAT],
      radar imagery, etc.). For flight safety reasons, the WF will not evacuate during exercises.

    1.6.2. 25 OWS COOP.
       1.6.2.1. For short term outages (up to 72 hours), the WF will assume local weather
       watch, warning and advisory responsibility.
       1.6.2.2. For long-term outages (greater than 72 hours), the 25 OWS’ plan is to resume all
       support from an alternate location.
       1.6.2.3. Exercises. In coordination with WFs, 25 OWS conducts periodic COOP

                                   AIRFIELD SERVICES

2.1. General. Airfield services include those actions affecting the KAFB aerodrome (defined
within 5 Nautical Miles [NM] of the airfield) or the base as a whole.
2.2. Observations. Weather observations are provided by NWS, Albuquerque under the
identifier of KABQ, and augmented by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) contract
personnel as required. Due to communication interface with NWS and the internet, a delay in
receiving current observations of 5-8 minutes exists:
   2.2.1. Meteorological Terminal Aviation Routine Report Aviation (METAR). METAR
   observations are created between 45 and 59 minutes after every hour. METARs are
   disseminated long-line between 51 and 59 minutes after the hour.
   2.2.2. Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI) SPECI is an unscheduled
   observation completed and transmitted when any of the KAFB special criteria listed in
   Attachment 3 have been observed or sensed. SPECI will contain all data elements found in
   a METAR plus additional remarks that elaborates on data in the body of the report. All
   SPECI reports will be prepared and transmitted as soon as possible after the relevant criteria
   are observed. Attachment 2 contains an example SPECI weather observation.
   2.2.3. Official Observing Points. The official observing point is the location of the
   Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) sensors. During periods of augmentation, the
   observation point will be along the road on the flight line (south) side of building 333
   (Hangar 333). During relocations to the AOL, and augmentation is required, the observation
   point is marked by a red box with a weather (WX) symbol inside of it on the Northwest
   corner of the parking lot West of Bldg 1017 along the fence.
   2.2.4. Observing Point Limitations.
       2.2.4.1. Augmented observations taken at the primary augmentation site (Bldg 333) are
       degraded because the observer’s view to the north is blocked by an aircraft hangar and
       thunder may not be heard due to flight line noise.
       2.2.4.2. Augmented observations taken at the AOL are degraded because view to the
       north through south is blocked by buildings, and northwest through north by buildings
       and thunder may not be heard due to flight line noise..
2.3. TAF Support. KAFB TAFs are produced and disseminated by the NWS and are identified
by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO of KABQ. TAFs are valid for 24 hours,
apply to the area within the 5NM area of the City of Albuquerque Sunport complex, and are
disseminated at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 Zulu time. Attachment 2 contains an example of a
typical City of Albuquerque Sunport TAF.
2.4. Resource Protection (RP) Support & WWA’s. The 25 OWS conducts a continuous
meteorological watch to identify and assess emerging and imminent threats to KAFB. Special
Weather Statements (SWS) and Watches, Warnings, and Advisories are special notices provided
by the 25 OWS resulting from both the forecast and METWATCH processes to assist military
decision makers with resource and RP decisions. Watches and warnings provide notice of

weather events posing a hazard to life or property. Advisories provide specific notice to an
operational agency of environmental phenomena with the potential to impact operations.
Customer responses to WWAs are listed in attachment 4.
   2.4.1. SWS. SWSs are special notices issued by the 25 OWS to assist military decision
   makers with RP decisions.
   2.4.2. Weather Watches. A weather watch is a special notice to installation
   personnel/supported units of a potential for environmental conditions of such intensity as to
   pose a hazard to life or property. They are used by installation personnel/supported units to
   make force protection and risk management decisions. Watches are issued for a 5NM radius
   of the center point of the KAFB runway complex and are defined in Table 2.1

   2.4.3. Weather Warnings. A special notice to notify installation personnel when an
   established weather condition of such intensity as to pose a hazard to life or property is
   occurring or is expected to occur. Weather warnings provide concise information outlining
   environmental threats and are used by commanders and personnel to make RP decisions and
   take protective action. Warnings are issued for a 5NM radius at the center point of the
   runway and are defined in Table 2.2
KIRTLANDAFBI15-101 3 APRIL 2013                                                             11

   2.4.4. Observed Weather Warnings. Lightning warnings are the only observed warning
   issued for KAFB and extends 5NM, 10NM, and 15NM in all directions from the airfield.
   Lightning warnings are not issued until lightning is observed, either visually or via the
   National Lightning Detection Network. The lightning warning will remain valid until
   lightning is no longer observed within range for at least 15 minutes. Exception: A lightning
   warning will not be cancelled if a thunderstorm is within 5NM (as indicated on radar).
   2.4.5. Weather Advisories. An observed weather ADVISORY is a special product
   notifying an end user when an established environmental condition effecting operations is
   occurring or immanent on KAFB and are defined in Table 2.3

Table 2.3. Weather Advisories
                                                                            Desired Lead

      2.4.6. WWA Numbering Scheme. Advisories, watches, and warnings are numbered
      consecutively by identifying the type of weather message (watch, warning, or advisory)
      followed by a five-digit number. The first two numbers indicate the current month while the
      second three numbers indicate the sequence number. For example, the message “Weather
      Warning 02-005” means the month is February (02) and this is the fifth (005) warning issued
      in the month. The message “Weather Advisory 12-013” means the month is December (12)
      and this is the thirteenth (013) advisory issued in the month. Examples of different messages
      are contained in Attachment 2.
      2.4.7. WWA Upgrades/Downgrades. WWAs will be upgraded (i.e., winds increase from
      35 knots to 50 knots) or downgraded as required. Upgrades should meet the desired lead
      times specified in Tables 2.1., 2.2. and 2.3. Only one warning will be in effect at a given
      time (and will include multiple warning criteria as required) except for forecast tornado
      warnings and/or observed lightning warnings. Tornado and lightning will be separate
      warnings. With the exception of tornado and lightning warnings, if a warning is issued for
      one criteria and it becomes necessary to warn for another criteria, a new warning and new
      number will be issued, to include all criteria expected. A separate valid time may be
      specified for each criteria if necessary.
      2.4.8. WWA Amendments. When WWAs no longer adequately describe the phenomenon's
      expected occurrence, a completely new WWA with a new number will be issued. The
      amendment will clearly state how the amendment or extension affects any previously issued
      notices.
      2.4.9. WWA Extensions. WWAs may be extended provided the extension is issued prior to
      the expiration of the original notice.
      2.4.10. WWA Cancellation. Warnings and watches are canceled when the weather
      phenomena is no longer occurring or expected to occur. Warnings not extended or canceled
      will automatically expire at the end of the valid period. Observed advisories will be canceled
      when the criteria is no longer occurring and have not occurred in the last 30 minutes. See
      para 2.4.4 for cancellation of observed lightning warnings.
2.5. Dissemination Process.
      2.5.1. Observations. Observations taken by either the FAA contractors or the ASOS
      automated observing system are disseminated by the FAA ASOS and is completely separate
      from KAFB. Observations taken by the KAFB weather technicians are disseminated via JET
      under the identifier of KIKR. When JET is nonoperational, the WF will relay observations to
      the following local organizations in order of priority listed in Table 2.4.

Table 2.4. Notification Priority
 1.   Tower commercial (505) 856-4903
 2.   377 ABW/CP commercial (505) 846-3777
 3.   58 SOW/WOC commercial (505) 846-9482
 4.   Base operations commercial (505) 846-8335
 5.   25 OWS DSN 228- 7665 commercial (520) 228-7665 – toll free (877) 451-8367 x1

   2.5.2. TAFs. FAA disseminates TAFs. If the FAA for any reason fails to disseminate a
   TAF, the WF will coordinate with the 25 OWS to disseminate TAFs via JET. If JET is
   nonoperational, the WF will disseminate TAFs to 377 ABW/CP and 58 SOW/WOC via
   telephone, fax, or e-mail. See Table 2.5.
   2.5.3. SWSs. SWSs provide advance notice of widespread hazardous weather conditions
   that have the potential to affect KAFB. 25 OWS transmits SWSs to WF leadership via e-
   mail. WF leadership forwards SWSs to 377 ABW and 58 SOW leadership. See Table 2.5.
   2.5.4. WWAs. The 25 OWS or WF will enter WWAs into JET which will disseminate the
   information to 377 ABW/CP, 58 SOW/WOC, and 377 MXS/MXOA Airfield Management.
   If JET is out-of-service, 25 OWS or the WF will make back-up calls. See Table 2.5. Upon
   notification, these units will further disseminate all WWAs using the pyramid notification
   scheme shown in Figure 2.1. In addition, the 377 ABW/CP disseminates all WWAs via e-
   mail and/or AtHoc.

Figure 2.1. Weather Pyramid Alerting




       2.5.4.1. Lightning Warnings. In addition to the normal WWA notification process, all
       lightning warnings are disseminated by the 377 ABW/CP to the base populace via the
       Giant Voice system, allowing all personnel on base to be prepared for dangerous weather.
       2.5.4.2. Tornado Warnings. In addition to the normal WWA notification process, the
       377 ABW/CP has the primary responsibility for sounding the base siren for a tornado
       warning issuance.
2.6. Cooperative Weather Watch (CWW). The NWS and Air Traffic Control (ATC) have
established procedures within their respective channels because of this the Albuquerque Sunport
ATC will not participate in a CWW with the KAFB WF as required by AFI 13-204V3, Airfield
Operations Procedures and Programs and AFMAN 15-111.
KIRTLANDAFBI15-101 3 APRIL 2013                                                                    15


   2.6.1. Procedures. The procedures require the Albuquerque Sunport ATC personnel to
   enter the tower visibility into the ASOS System when tower visibility is less than 4 statute
   miles (SM) (6000 meters) and different from the surface prevailing visibility
       2.6.1.1. These procedures also require the Albuquerque Sunport ATC personnel to relay
       to FAA Flight Services any PIREPS they receive who then disseminate them
       accordingly. As well as any occurrence of previously unreported weather conditions that
       could affect flight safety or be critical to the safety or efficiency of other local operations
       and resources.
   2.6.2. ATC Limited Observation Training. The Albuquerque Sunport ATC personnel
   receive ATC limited observation training as part of their FAA certification process.
2.7. PMSV Support. Weather information is available via PMSV during duty hours on
frequency 342.3 MHz. The duty forecaster will monitor PMSV traffic for all aircraft contacts.
For aircraft outside the range of our PMSV system, the KAFB WF or 25 OWS can provide
PMSV support through a phone patch to the 377 ABW/CP (DSN 246-3777/Commercial (505)
846-3777). PMSV outages are discussed in para 5.3.2.
2.8. Emergency Action(s) Response.
   2.8.1. Aircraft Mishap. When notified on an aircraft mishap, the WF will initiate a save of
   applicable data used in the development of any weather products provided and provide this
   data to investigating agencies upon request.
       2.8.1.1. If the WF provided the MWP, the WF will notify the OWS Operations Floor
       Production Supervisor of all aircraft mishaps as soon as possible after notification of the
       event. The WF will coordinate with 25 OWS to save all applicable data and products. If
       products from other OWSs were used, the WF will coordinate with all applicable OWSs
       to ensure data is saved. Enough data covering weather conditions before and after the
       mishap will be saved to fully reconstruct environmental conditions.
       2.8.1.2. If an OWS, or another WF provided the MWP, they will conduct the data save in
       coordination with any other Air Force Weather units involved.
   2.8.2. SWAP. The WF will initiate SWAP in accordance with criteria listed in Table 2.6
   SWAP ensures sufficient manpower is available to meet the increased demand for timely
   weather information from its supported unit(s) during significant weather events. It is
   imperative that timely and accurate weather watches, warnings, and advisories are
   disseminated to all agencies to ensure personnel and RP. The WF will initiate a heightened
   METWATCH. The WF forecaster will notify the WF Chief of SWAP activation during
   normal staff duty hours. During non-duty hours, the 25 OWS will notify the WF standby
   forecaster when conditions listed in Table 2.6 have been met and the WF technician will
   activate SWAP.

   2.8.3. WF Forecaster Recall Requirements. The WF forecaster will be notified/recalled
   under the following circumstances:
      2.8.3.1. The 25 OWS notifies the standby forecaster prior to issuing any watch or
      warning for KAFB.
      2.8.3.2. The 25 OWS notifies the standby forecaster when observations are not being
      transmitted or are not representative of current conditions.
   2.8.4. Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-yield Explosive (CBRNE)
   Response.
      2.8.4.1. If surface observations or alphanumeric forecasts are requested, make sure that
      observations and forecasts provided are representative of the location/time of the CBRNE
      event.
      2.8.4.2. Work closely with Emergency Management or other functions to ensure the
      supported commander gets a consistent picture.
      2.8.4.3. Upon request from Disaster Preparedness or any other agency, obtain/provide
      Chemical Downwind Messages from the servicing CU.

                                   MISSION SERVICES

3.1. General. The WF and 25 OWS support the KAFB flying and non-flying missions. This
chapter identifies the flying and non-flying missions and the weather support provided.
3.2. Flying Missions. The WF and the 25 OWS provide weather support to the flying units
listed in Attachment 4. The bulk of flying operations at KAFB are supported by the WF.
3.3. MWP. MWPs fuse theater scale products with local mission requirements enabling the
direct inject of weather impacts into war fighter planning and/or execution. The result is a
product designed to provide timely, accurate, and relevant environmental information for
planning and execution. The MWPs must be horizontally consistent with (but not necessarily
mirror) products issued by any OWS and Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA).
   3.3.1. Flight Weather MEFs. The KAFB page located on the Air Force Portal is the
   primary means in which a MEF can be obtained by the flying units, upon request as a back
   up the MEF can be faxed or e-mailed upon request. Updates can be obtained by contacting
   the WF at DSN 246-9707/Commercial (505) 846-9707.

                                          Chapter 5

                                 WEATHER EQUIPMENT

5.1. General. This chapter provides a brief description of the meteorological and
communications equipment used by the WF. Additionally, it provides information on backup
systems, maintenance, and restoring priorities.
5.2. Meteorological Equipment. The WF uses the Weather Surveillance Radar, 1988 Doppler
(WSR-88D) radar to determine the current state of the atmosphere. This critical system provides
customers the most timely, accurate and relevant weather intelligence possible.
   5.2.1. WSR-88D. The WF utilizes the WSR-88D as its primary source of radar data.
   Weather technicians make use of an Open Principle User Processor (OPUP) to analyze
   complex radar signatures and obtain detailed information on storm intensity, movement,
   internal circulation, and general wind flow. Weather technicians will routinely incorporate
   the latest radar information into all mission execution forecasts and RP products.
5.3. Communications Equipment. The following systems are the backbone of the WF
communications network:
   5.3.1. JET. As discussed in para 2.5 of this instruction, JET is the primary system for
   disseminating forecast, observations, warnings, watches, and advisories. Telephones are used
   as a backup for key aircraft controlling agencies.
   5.3.2. PMSV Radio. The PMSV Radio (342.3 MHz) allows the WF to communicate with
   aircrews, both on the ground and flying, as well as KAFB CP personnel. If the PMSV is out-
   of- service, aircrews can contact the WF or the OWS via phone patch (where possible) to get
   weather data.
   5.3.3. Phones/Hotlines. Phones and hotlines serve primarily for rapidly passing along
   critical, time-sensitive information, as well as to serve for backup services.
   5.3.4. Local Area Network (LAN). The WF relies heavily on the LAN to improve the
   timeliness and accuracy of weather intelligence to our customers.
5.4. Maintenance.

Table 5.1. Identifies which organizations provide preventive maintenance and repair
weather and communications equipment.

   5.4.1. Restoral Priorities. Priorities for restoring critical systems exist the event natural
   disasters or any other anomaly, simultaneously impacting systems base wide. Significant
   indicates a situation where the equipment is completely inoperative, while minimal means
   the equipment is in limited operation. The priorities for weather equipment are listed in
   Table 5.2 below (priorities may be adjusted based on forecasted weather):

   A2.1.5. The underline character "_" indicates a required space between the groups. If a
   group is not reported, the preceding space is also not reported. In addition to the format
   given, agencies shall provide for the inclusion of any special Beginning-of-Message, End-of-
   Message, or End-of-Transmission signals required by their communications system.
   A2.1.6. The actual content of a METAR or SPECI depends on the observation program at
   the individual station. At designated stations, the 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 Coordinated
   Universal Time (UTC) METAR's include additional data specified by the responsible agency
   and are known as 6-hourly reports. At designated stations, the 0300, 0900, 1500, and 2100
   UTC METAR's are known as 3-hourly reports and also contain additional information
   specified by the responsible agency.

   A2.2.1. The forecast follows the same general format as the observation with the following
   exceptions noted :
      A2.2.1.1. Valid Date/Time. Forecasts are valid for a 24-hour period. In this example,
      the forecast is valid from the Fifteenth at 1800Z until the sixteenth at 1800Z.
      A2.2.1.2. BECMG – This is a code to indicate the predominant conditions will change to
      (or become) the conditions listed in the line of the forecast. The conditions will change
      during the time period follows the BECMG code (i.e. 1700 to 1800Z) (these groups are
      seen rarely in NWS TAF’s, and are common in Military TAF’s).
      A2.2.1.3. FM – This is a code to indicate the predominant conditions will change to (or
      From) the conditions listed in the line of the forecast. The conditions will change starting
      at the time that follows the FM code (i.e. 2000 equals 2000Z in the example above).
      A2.2.1.4. TEMPO – This code means the conditions listed on the line may occur for
      periods of an hour or less (1 hour and 15 minutes or less for thunderstorms) anytime
      between the time frame following the TEMPO code (1900Z to 2200Z in this example).
      A2.2.1.5. Max Temp/Min Temp. T24 indicates a maximum temperature in Celsius to
      occur at 20Z. T10 indicates a minimum temperature of 10 Celsius to occur at 10Z (Note:
      M indicates a minus sign in front of the number: M05 = -5 C)(These groups are not
      included in NWS TAF’s But are in Military TAF’s.)
