                                            Chapter 1

                                   GENERAL PROVISIONS

1.1. Air Force Policy. Leave is an important and significant benefit for all employees. There is
a mutual employee-management responsibility to plan and schedule the use of annual leave
throughout the year. The scheduling of leave is so important that by law it is a prerequisite to the
restoration of annual leave that may be forfeited because of exigencies of the service or because
of sickness. Managers must administer leave and excused absences on a uniform and equitable
basis within the scope of applicable laws and regulations. They must base their decisions to deny
leave requests and cancel approved leave on the necessity for the employee’s services. Denial or
cancellation of leave is not disciplinary in character and must not be used as a punitive measure.
In granting leave, managers must consider the needs of the Air Force and the welfare of the
employees. Authority to approve leave requests is normally delegated to the lowest supervisory
level having personal knowledge of the work requirements and the employee’s leave record. The
OPM 71, Request for Leave or Approved Absence is available on the OPM web site
(http://www.opm.gov) for the purpose of requesting leave.
1.2. Responsibilities of Installation Commanders, Heads of Serviced Organizations,
Supervisors, and Employees.
   1.2.1. Commander to Whom Appointing Authority Is Delegated (unless otherwise specified
   in a servicing agreement under AFI 36-105, Civilian Personnel Servicing Arrangements).
   NOTE: Installation commanders may designate the Civilian Personnel Officer to act for
   them in carrying out these functions.
       1.2.1.1. Administer leave according to law and regulation.
       1.2.1.2. Establish local policy as authorized in this instruction.
       1.2.1.3. Ensure personnel are informed of their rights, responsibilities, and administrative
       requirements.
       1.2.1.4. Assist operating officials in carrying out assigned responsibilities.
       1.2.1.5. Identify and promptly correct sick leave abuses.
       1.2.1.6. Ensure compliance with applicable directives in reporting and certifying time
       and attendance.
   1.2.2. Installation Commanders or Heads of Serviced Organizations. Establish appropriate
   internal administrative procedures for requesting and receiving approval of leave, and specify
   those supervisory levels authorized to approve leave.
   1.2.3. Supervisors or Team Leaders Authorized to Approve Leave:
       1.2.3.1. Ensure that all employees under their supervision are informed of the procedure
       they must follow in requesting and using leave.
       1.2.3.2. Ensure that all absences from duty are appropriately charged according to
       applicable laws and regulations.
 8                                                  AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


        1.2.3.3. Request advice and assistance from the servicing Civilian Personnel Flight
        (CPF) when there is a question concerning employee entitlements and the type of leave
        appropriate to the situation.
        1.2.3.4. DELETED.
        1.2.3.5. Approve annual leave requests or projected annual leave when work schedules
        permit. When a request for annual leave cannot be initially approved or is subsequently
        denied, then make every effort to reschedule the annual leave commensurate with the
        needs of the organization and the desires of the employee.
     1.2.4. Employees must:
        1.2.4.1. Be dependable and regularly report for work.
        1.2.4.2. IAW applicable procedures, request leave in advance, and cooperate in
        rescheduling leave when necessary.
        1.2.4.3. Report unexpected absence to the supervisor and request approval for the
        absence according to established policies.
        1.2.4.4. Comply with DOD 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program and AFI 31-
        501, Personnel Security Program Management, when planning travel to a foreign
        country during a period of approved leave.
        1.2.4.5. Comply with the requirement to provide contact information regarding their
        location while on leave. Employees must provide contact information for the purpose of
        recall, should one be necessary. Air Force leadership realized that not having contact and
        location information on absent civilian employees who were absent on leave, adversely
        affects the ability to maximize the reconstitution of its force.
1.3. Charges to Leave. The minimum charge for either annual or sick leave is 15 minutes and
additional leave is charged in increments of 15 minutes. Absence in a nonpay status (Leave
Without Pay (LWOP) and Absence Without Leave (AWOL)) is charged in increments of 15
minutes for the actual time absent. Leave is charged only on those days the employee would
otherwise work and receive pay. Leave is not charged for an absence on holidays or other
nonworkdays, except for when certain employees are paid additional compensation for standby
duty (e.g., firefighters). Military leave is charged only for hours during which a civilian
employee would otherwise have been scheduled to work and receive pay (see paragraph 5.8).
     1.3.1. If an employee is unavoidably absent or tardy for less than 1 hour, for a reason that is
     acceptable to the supervisor, the employee may be excused without charge to leave. On the
     other hand, the supervisor may decide not to excuse the absence, and may charge the
     employee AWOL or approve an employee’s request for leave to cover the absence. When an
     employee is charged leave for an unauthorized absence or tardiness, the supervisor may not
     require the individual to perform work for any part of the leave period charged against the
     leave account. If circumstances warrant, the supervisor can change the charge from AWOL
     to annual leave, sick leave, or LWOP.
     1.3.2. When an employee has insufficient annual or sick leave available to cover an
     approved leave request (i.e., OPM 71, Request for Leave or Approved Absence or other
     appropriate form), the excess absence is charged in accordance with the precedence
     established in the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Leave Conversion
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                             9


   Matrix. See DoD 7000.14-R, Financial Management Regulation, Volume 8, Chapter 5,
   Table 5-2. If an advance of sick leave is approved later, it may be substituted for the leave
   initially charged. However, the Comptroller General has consistently held that, when leave
   has been requested, approved, and used, retroactive substitution of one category of leave for
   another category may be made only under the conditions of a specific law and/or regulation.
   If the approving supervisor does not approve any, or all, of a period of absence, the OPM 71,
   or other appropriate form, is annotated to show AWOL.
1.4. General Provisions Relating to Approval of Annual and Sick Leave. An employee
serving under an appointment with a definite time limitation cannot be granted more leave than
the amount that can be earned and credited before the appointment expires.
   1.4.1. If an employee whose leave record is being transferred from another Air Force activity
   or another federal agency must take leave before the official leave record is received, the
   servicing civilian payroll office determines whether the employee has enough leave available
   to cover the absence. The leave balances on the last leave and earning statement are
   acceptable evidence. If necessary, the civilian payroll officer will request the employee’s
   leave balance by telephone or message. If it is not possible to make such a determination, the
   absence will be charged to leave without pay pending receipt of leave records.
1.5. Refund for Unearned Leave. When an employee is separated before earning all the
annual or sick leave that has been advanced, usually the value of the unearned leave must be
deducted from any compensation due. A deduction from any compensation due is not required if
the employee is separated for reasons of death, disability retirement, or resignation for physical
disability that is evidenced by acceptable medical documentation.
1.6. Leave for Working Parents. It is Air Force policy that management be responsive and
compassionate in leave policies for working parents.
   1.6.1. Absence for Maternity Reasons. Absence from duty for reasons related to pregnancy
   and confinement is charged to sick leave, annual leave, or leave without pay, depending on
   the circumstances and availability of each type of leave. The employee is responsible for
   providing notice substantially in advance of the anticipated leave dates. Requests for sick
   leave are treated the same as any request for leave to cover a medically certified temporary
   disability. All sick leave requested which exceeds 3 days must be supported by medical
   documentation showing that the employee is incapacitated to perform the duties of her
   position for the period covered by the certificate, unless the supervisor specifically waives
   this requirement. (See Chapter 3 for requests of advanced sick leave and Chapter 10,
   Family and Medical Leave.) If the employee requests additional annual leave or leave
   without pay following confinement in order to care for the infant, supervisors should make
   every effort to approve the request, work load permitting. See Chapter 10 for requirements
   to invoke the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
   1.6.2. Absence for Paternity Reasons. A male employee may request sick leave, annual
   leave or leave without pay for the purpose of caring for his minor children or the mother of
   his newborn child during confinement or incapacitation due to complications arising from the
   delivery. In considering leave requests for these reasons, supervisors should follow the
   policies set forth in Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4, and Chapter 10, and local policies
   and practices.

                                             ANNUAL LEAVE

2.1. Amount of Annual Leave Earned. The amount of annual leave employees earn depends
on their length of service and their basic workweek. Employees are assigned to leave earning
categories as follows.
   2.1.1. Category 1. Employees with less than 3 years of service.
   2.1.2. Category 2. Employees with 3 but less than 15 years of service.
   2.1.3. Category 3. Employees with 15 or more years of service.
   2.1.4. Full-time employees earn leave as shown in Table 2.1:

Table 2.1. Full-time Employees Hours Credit.

   Leave           40-Hour Basic              56-Hour Basic              60-Hour Basic               72-Hour Basic

   2.1.5. Part-time employees must have a regularly scheduled tour of duty to earn leave.
   However, credit is given for the time they are in a pay status (including the hours worked
   outside their scheduled tour of duty) not in excess of 80 hours in the pay period as follows
   (see paragraph 2.1 for definition of categories):
        2.1.5.1. Category 1. 1 hour for each 20 hours in pay status.
        2.1.5.2. Category 2. 1 hour for each 13 hours in pay status.
        2.1.5.3. Category 3. 1 hour for each 10 hours in pay status.
   2.1.6. No annual leave is earned within a pay period where LWOP or AWOL reaches 80
   hours.
   2.1.7. Intermittent employees do not earn annual leave since                                 by        regulation
   (5 CFR 340.401(b)), they do not have a regularly scheduled tour of duty.
2.2. Maximum Annual Leave Accumulation. The maximum amount of annual leave that an
employee may carry forward from one leave year to another is 30 days (240 hours), or the
amount accumulated under earlier statute, whichever is greater. Any leave to the employee’s
credit at the end of the leave year that exceeds the maximum accumulation is either forfeited or
restored according to paragraph 2.10
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                             11


   2.2.1. For employees on uncommon tours of duty, the following formula is applied:
   Multiply 240 times the number of hours in the workweek; then divide the result by 40. Using
   this formula, the maximum accumulation for an employee with a 72-hour standby workweek
   would be 432 hours. The maximum accumulation for an employee with a 56-hour workweek
   would be 336 hours.
   2.2.2. For US citizens employed outside the United States (except for certain local hires), the
   maximum annual leave accumulation is 45 days (360 hours) or the amount to the employee’s
   credit at the beginning of the leave year, whichever is greater. Employees eligible for 45
   days of cumulative annual leave are normally those who are under a transportation agreement
   in the overseas area. Upon return from overseas, the maximum annual leave accumulation is
   30 days (240 hours) or the amount carried over from the previous leave year, whichever is
   greater, not to exceed 45 days (360 hours).
   2.2.3. For employees who are serving in a position in the Senior Executive Service, there is a
   maximum limitation on annual leave accumulation of 90 days (720 hours) or the amount
   accumulated under earlier statute, whichever is greater.
2.3. When Annual Leave Becomes Available for Use. All projected annual leave an employee
will earn during the leave year will be available for planning purposes at the beginning of the
leave year. See paragraph 2.4.1 for guidance on approving annual leave that will be earned later
in the leave year and for procedures to request advancing annual leave. Employees whose
appointments are for 90 calendar days or more may use annual leave during the first 90 days of
employment. If an appointment is for less than 90 calendar days, an employee is not entitled to
annual leave until after being employed for a continuous period of 90 days under successive
appointments without a break in service. If an employee has a series of successive appointments,
without a break in service of 1 day or more, which then exceeds 90 days, the employee is
credited with annual leave which would have accrued from the date of initial appointment.
   2.3.1. Scheduling Annual Leave. Employees must take positive action before the beginning
   of the third full pay period prior to the end of the leave year to schedule or reschedule
   canceled leave so as to avoid situations where employees approach the end of the leave year
   with a significant amount of annual leave that must be used or forfeited. Written leave
   schedules will be used to certify proper scheduling had been accomplished when requesting
   restoration of forfeited annual leave. Failure on the employee’s part to schedule annual leave
   does not relieve management of its responsibility to assure that the leave is in fact scheduled
   for use. However, when employees choose not to request or use annual leave to avoid
   forfeiture, they are not entitled to have forfeited leave restored for later use.
2.4. When Annual Leave is Granted. Employees are granted annual leave to allow them time
off for vacations and for personal and emergency purposes. The use of annual leave is a right of
the employee in that the employee is either given an opportunity to use the annual leave, or to the
extent permitted by law, is paid for it at the time of separation. Except in cases of emergency,
annual leave must be requested by the employee and approved by the appropriate leave-
approving official in advance of the absence. Supervisors must ensure that all employees are
informed of the procedure to be followed in requesting and obtaining approval of leave. This
includes requests for annual leave in advance of the absence as well as leave for emergencies.
Supervisors should consider employees’ desires and personal convenience as well as the work
situation when granting leave. They must not make arbitrary decisions to deny leave. However,
 12                                                 AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


the final determination as to the scheduling and the amount of annual leave granted at any
specific time is made by the supervisor authorized to approve leave. Requests for annual leave
shall be submitted to the approving official on an OPM 71 or other appropriate form.
   2.4.1. Advancing Annual Leave. An employee may be granted all annual leave which will
   be earned during the current leave year. However, in advancing an employee annual leave in
   excess of the amount actually earned, the supervisor authorized to approve leave must have
   reasonable assurance that the employee will be in duty status long enough to earn the leave
   granted before the end of the leave year. (For making this determination, employee’s current
   leave balance may be obtained by the supervisor accessing civilian personnel data systems
   (Civilian Servicing Unit (CSU) Application) at the work site or by contacting the local
   civilian payroll (liaison) office.) The certification of the OPM 71, or other appropriate form,
   by the leave-approving official will be accepted as evidence that any annual leave reported
   has been approved. If the employee’s employment with the government discontinues prior to
   earning the advanced leave, the balance of the advanced leave upon separation is considered
   a debt, unless the employee dies, retires for disability, or resigns or is separated as a result of
   a disability that prevents him or her from returning to work.
   2.4.2. Use of Annual Leave Before Separation. A supervisor may not grant an employee
   annual leave when the supervisor knows that the employee will not return from the leave of
   absence to federal service, except when the employee:
       2.4.2.1. Is being separated because of reduction-in-force or declination of transfer of
       function used to extend the separation date to attain first eligibility for retirement annuity
       and/or Federal Employees Health Benefit (FEHB) annuitant coverage (5 U.S.C. 3502,
       6302, 8905, and 5 CFR 351.608).
       2.4.2.2. Is being carried in a leave status pending acceptance for active military duty.
       2.4.2.3. Has made application for disability retirement.
       2.4.2.4. Takes annual leave prior to separation, but is present for, and performs duty on
       the employee’s last administrative workday (Comptroller General Decision (C.G.) B-
       223876). For example, an employee who is a military spouse must be present on the last
       duty day prior to his/her LWOP to accompany his/her spouse.
       2.4.2.5. Takes accrued annual leave during the final hours of the last day of employment
       before separation, providing the employee substantially worked the entire final pay
       period, including part of the last day (C.G. B-190374). See example above.
   2.4.3. Lump-Sum Payment Upon Separation. An employee is entitled upon separation to all
   accumulated and accrued annual leave credited to the employee which consists of the
   following: (1) the regular carry-over balances from the previous year, if any; plus (2)
   accrued and unused annual leave during the current leave year, if any; plus (3) any unused
   restored annual leave maintained in a separate leave account.
   2.4.4. Use of Annual Leave During Active Military Duty. Members of the Reserve or
   National Guard may use annual leave during active military duty.
2.5. Requiring Employees To Take Leave. No employee may be placed on annual leave:
   2.5.1. As a disciplinary measure.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                              13


   2.5.2. Pending issuance of a notice of proposed adverse action, unless requested by the
   employee.
   2.5.3. During the notice period before adverse action, unless requested by the employee.
   2.5.4. Otherwise, employees may be placed on annual leave as the needs of the service
   require (for example, during a period of reduced or suspended operations or where an
   employee is instructed to take vacation leave at a time other than at the specific time initially
   requested). The required use of annual leave must be based on factors that are reasonable and
   equitable, which do not discriminate among employees, and which are not arbitrary.
2.6. Substitution of Annual Leave for Leave Without Pay. Substitutions may be made in the
following circumstances:
   2.6.1. When leave without pay is charged pending receipt of an employee’s leave record
   from the former employing agency, credited annual leave is substituted for the leave without
   pay upon receipt of the leave record.
   2.6.2. When leave without pay is granted to an employee pending a recredit of annual leave
   upon completion of a refund of a lump sum leave payment, the annual leave recredited upon
   completion of the refund may be substituted for the leave without pay, provided the
   employee requests the substitution at the time the leave without pay is requested.
2.7. Substitution of Annual Leave for Sick Leave. An employee on extended sick leave
(including sick leave for maternity reasons) may be granted annual leave to cover any part of the
absence, provided the request for leave is made in advance. Annual leave cannot be substituted
retroactively for sick leave previously taken as a means of avoiding a forfeiture of annual leave
at the end of the leave year. Advanced sick leave may be liquidated at the employee’s request by
a substitution of annual leave, provided the substitution is requested before the time the annual
leave would be forfeited.
2.8. When Lump-Sum Payments Are Made. Normally, separated employees (including those
overseas who are allowed a 45-day annual leave accumulation) are paid a lump sum for all their
accumulated annual leave. There are certain exceptions to this general requirement, such as
employees entering military service, those transferring to an international organization, those
converted to a Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) position, and those who are removed from a
position to which they were illegally appointed. An employee entering military service may
elect to allow annual leave to remain in the leave account or to receive a lump-sum payment.
Also if an employee dies, the lump-sum payment made to survivors includes payment for all
accrued and accumulated annual leave to the employee’s credit at the time of death.
2.9. When a Refund of the Lump-Sum Payment Is Required. If an employee who has
received a lump-sum leave payment is reemployed before the end of the period covered by the
payment, the employee must refund an amount equal to the gross compensation received for the
unexpired portion of the lump-sum leave period. This includes pay before deductions of any
kind and, if applicable, differentials and allowances received.
2.10. Restoration of Forfeited Annual Leave. Annual leave which would otherwise be
forfeited may be restored when it is lost because of exigencies of the service or sickness of the
employee, if use of the leave was scheduled in advance. Leave may also be restored when an
administrative error causes the loss of annual leave otherwise accruable. Before forfeited annual
 14                                                AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


leave may be considered for restoration, use of the annual leave must have been requested,
approved, and scheduled in writing before the start of the third biweekly pay period before the
end of the leave year. Any leave lost by an employee subject to the Defense Base Closure and
Realignment Act of 1990, during the period from 1 Oct 1992 to 31 Dec 1997, and employees in
DoD activities designated by the BRAC Commission for closure shall be restored to the
employee and shall be credited to the employee’s leave account. The closing of a base is an
exigency of the service permitting employees to carry over use-or-lose leave without meeting the
criteria for restoration explained below. See 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3).
   2.10.1. Exigencies of the Service. Before forfeited annual leave is restored, there must be a
   determination that an exigency is of major importance and that an employee may not use
   scheduled annual leave. The following officials, or their designee, have authority to approve
   exigencies causing cancellation of leave:
       2.10.1.1. The Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Air Force for all
       employees in the Office of the Secretary of the Air Force and other employees not within
       the purview of paragraphs 2.10.1.2 through 2.10.1.4
       2.10.1.2. The Assistant Vice Chief of Staff for all Air Staff employees not within the
       purview of paragraphs 2.10.1.3 and 2.10.1.4
       2.10.1.3. The Deputy Chiefs of Staff for their employees.
       2.10.1.4. An Installation Commander, his designee, or head of serviced organization as
       referenced in paragraphs 1.2.1 and 1.2.2
       2.10.1.5. An employee may submit a claim to OPM if a request for restoration of annual
       leave based on an exigency is denied. See 5 CFR 178.102 for procedures for submitting
       claims. Note that 5 CFR 178.101 excludes claims subject to negotiated grievance
       procedures.
   2.10.2. Exigency of the Service Approval Process. Normally, approval of an exigency is
   required in advance of cancellation of leave. In the event of an emergency, this
   determination must be made as soon after the occurrence of the emergency as possible. As
   soon as it is known that leave will be canceled and forfeiture will be unavoidable, the
   supervisor initiates a letter to the designated official explaining the exigency, and requesting
   approval to cancel the scheduled leave. The supervisor coordinates the letter with the CPF to
   ensure that the conditions for restoration in governing directives are met, and that
   documentation to support the request includes, as a minimum:
       2.10.2.1. The specific beginning and ending dates of the exigency period, unless the
       suddenness or uncertainty of the circumstances prevents advance determination. (The
       dates are needed to establish the specific period within which the employee was
       prevented from using annual leave.)
       2.10.2.2. The dates and number of hours scheduled which must be canceled, and when
       this leave was scheduled and approved.
       2.10.2.3. A description of the exigency which shows that it is of such importance that the
       employee cannot be excused from duty.
       2.10.2.4. A statement as to why there is no alternative to cancellation of the scheduled
       leave and why use of the leave cannot be rescheduled during the remainder of the year.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                            15


     2.10.2.5. The designated official renders a decision on the request and returns it through
     the CPF to the originating supervisor for transmittal to the employee.
  2.10.3. Establishing Restored Leave Account due to Exigency of the Service. Promptly after
  the leave year ends, the employee should submit a request for restoration of leave with the
  approval of exigency attached, stating the actual number of hours lost on specific dates that
  could not be rescheduled, and then forwards it through the supervisor for endorsement to the
  CPF. The CPF will review the request and upon determination that the documentation is
  adequate, will endorse it to the civilian payroll office which, in turn, sends it to DFAS for
  establishment of a Restored Annual Leave Account, with a copy to the employee.
  2.10.4. Sickness of the Employee. The employee initiates the request for restoration of
  annual leave forfeited as a result of sickness as soon as the leave year ends and has the
  supervisor endorse it to the servicing CPF. The CPF will review the request and, upon
  determination that the documentation is adequate, will endorse it to the civilian payroll office
  and DFAS for establishment of a Restored Annual Leave Account, with a copy to the
  employee. The employee’s request must include:
     2.10.4.1. Specific beginning and, where known, ending dates of the period of illness or
     incapacity which interfered with the use of annual leave. The supervisor has the option
     of requiring medical documentation.
     2.10.4.2. Dates and number of hours of annual leave scheduled which had to be
     canceled; and when this leave was scheduled and approved.
     2.10.4.3. Information as to why canceled annual leave could not be rescheduled before
     the end of the leave year.
  2.10.5. Administrative Error. When an administrative error causes loss of leave, all leave
  must be restored as long as the leave was accrued after 30 Jun 1960. Official leave records
  should be used to substantiate the amount of annual leave to be restored. If these records are
  not available, an estimate of the employee’s leave account is acceptable if accompanied by
  required documentation to explain the basis for the estimate. If the employee is separated
  before the error is discovered, the restored leave is subject to credit and liquidation by lump-
  sum payment if a claim is filed within 3 years immediately following the date of discovery of
  the error.
  2.10.6. Using Restored Leave. Restored annual leave must be used by the end of the leave
  year ending two years after the termination date of the exigency of the public business that
  resulted in forfeiture of the annual leave; or the date the employee is determined to be
  recovered and able to return to duty if the leave was forfeited because of sickness; or the date
  of restoration of the annual leave forfeited because of administrative error.
     2.10.6.1. Exceptions to the two-year rule apply for employees at Department of Defense
     (DoD) installations undergoing closure or realignment under the provisions of section
     4434 of Public Law 102-484, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993,
     October 23, 1992 and section 341 and 2816 of Public Law 103-337, October 5, 1994,
     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995. A full-time employee shall
     schedule and use excess annual leave of 416 hours or less by the end of the leave year in
     progress 2 years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3).
     The agency shall extend this period by 1 leave year for each additional 208 hours of
16                                               AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


     excess annual leave or any portion thereof. A part-time employee shall schedule and use
     excess annual leave in an amount equal to or less than 20 percent of the number of hours
     in the employee’s scheduled annual tour of duty by the end of the leave year in progress 2
     years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). The agency
     shall extend this period by 1 leave year for each additional number of hours of excess
     annual leave, or any portion thereof, equal to 10 percent of the number of hours in the
     employee’s scheduled annual tour of duty.
     2.10.6.2. Restored leave should be used before using regularly accrued leave, especially
     when small amounts (5 days or less) are involved. In the case of large amounts of
     restored leave it may be appropriate to prorate the use over the entire 2-year limit, or such
     lesser times as deemed warranted. In all cases, where requested annual leave is to be
     charged to the restored leave account, appropriate entry will be made on the OPM 71 or
     other appropriate form. The civilian payroll office may develop local guidelines for use
     of restored leave.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                            17


                                           Chapter 3

                                         SICK LEAVE

3.1. Amount of Sick Leave Earned. All full-time employees on a 40-hour basic workweek or
an 80-hour biweekly work schedule, regardless of their length of service, earn 4 hours of sick
leave for each full biweekly pay period. Employees on uncommon tours of duty, such as
firefighters, earn sick leave at a proportionate rate. (See Table 2.1., Category 1, for examples.)
Part-time employees are credited with sick leave in an amount equal to the amount of annual
leave credited to employees in Category 1 as outlined in paragraph 2.1.1 No sick leave is accrued
in a pay period where leave without pay (LWOP) or absence without leave (AWOL) reaches 80
cumulative hours, or multiples of 80 hours, e.g., 160 hours, 320 hours, or the total hours of a
biweekly uncommon tour of duty. Intermittent employees do not earn sick leave since by
regulation (5 CFR 340.401(b)), they do not have a regularly scheduled tour of duty.
3.2. Use of Sick Leave. Sick leave is a qualified right of the employee and may be used only
for absences:
   3.2.1. When incapacitated for performance of duties by physical or mental illness, injury,
   pregnancy, childbirth, or illness from immunizations or vaccinations (whether or not required
   as a condition of employment).
   3.2.2. For medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment, including periodic physical
   examination for retention of status in a Reserve component of the Armed Forces or National
   Guard.
   3.2.3. When a member of an employee’s immediate family is afflicted with a contagious
   disease and requires the care and attendance of the employee, or when, through exposure to
   contagious disease, the presence at work of the employee would endanger the health of
   others.
   3.2.4. To participate in drug or alcohol counseling programs.
   3.2.5. To make arrangements for adoption-related activities, including appointments with
   adoption agencies, social workers and attorneys; court proceedings; required travel; and any
   other activities necessary to allow the adoption to proceed. This includes periods during
   which the adoptive parent is home to care for the newly adopted child, as required by the
   adoption agency or by the court.
       3.2.5.1. Leave for adoption can be sick leave, annual leave or leave without pay.
       Because prospective adoptive parents commonly must make a commitment that one
       parent will remain at home for several months in order to qualify for adoption, special
       consideration should be given to requests for leave for this purpose. Supervisors are
       encouraged to be responsive in granting leave to meet the needs of adoptive parents.
       3.2.5.2. Deleted.
   3.2.6. See paragraph 3.3 below for an explanation of sick leave for general family care and
   bereavement purposes under the 13-day entitlement.
3.3. Limited Amount of Sick Leave Use for Family Care. Sick leave may be used to provide
care for a family member as a result of physical or mental illness, injury, pregnancy, childbirth,
 18                                                AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


or medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment; or to make arrangements necessitated by
the death of a family member or attend the funeral of a family member. A full-time employee
may use up to 104 hours (13 days) of his/her sick leave each leave year for family care and
bereavement purposes. Part-time employees and employees with uncommon tours of duty are
also covered. They may use an amount of leave-not to exceed the number of sick leave hours
normally accrued by that employee in a leave year. For example, an employee scheduled to
work 56/60/72 hours per week, could use 112, 120, or 144 hours. The definition of a family
member may be found at Attachment 1 of this instruction.
3.4. Availability and Recredit of Sick Leave. Sick leave becomes available for use at the
beginning of the pay period during which it is earned. There is no limitation on the amount of
sick leave that may be carried forward from one year to another. Any sick leave to an
employee’s credit upon separation from federal service may be recredited if the individual is
reemployed on or after 2 Dec 1994 unless the sick leave was used in the computation of an
annuity. (See 5 CFR 630.502(1)).
3.5. How Sick Leave Is Requested and Approved. Sick leave for prearranged medical
appointments (including dental or optical examinations or treatment and drug and alcohol
counseling sessions) must be requested in advance of the absence. Sick leave for absence
because of illness, injury, exposure to contagious disease, illness of a family member with a
contagious disease or other circumstances of incapacity which are not known in advance must be
requested as soon as possible after the beginning of the absence (normally within the first hour or
two). For absences of 3 days or less, sick leave must be requested on the first day and on every
additional day of absence, unless the supervisor expressly relieves the employee of this
requirement. Requests for sick leave for nonemergency medical appointments, even though
submitted with proper evidence, may be denied if it is determined that the employee’s services
are needed. If the employee fails to follow prescribed procedures for requesting or documenting
either emergency or nonemergency sick leave, the request may be denied if the supervisor
considers that there were insufficient extenuating circumstances to warrant approval.
   3.5.1. Absences of More Than 3 Days. Sick leave of more than 3 consecutive scheduled
   workdays for employees on a “normal” administrative workweek (e.g., 8 hours a day, 40
   hours a week or compressed 5/4-9) must be supported by medical documentation (or other
   administratively acceptable documentation for absence) unless the supervisor specifically
   waives this requirement. The medical documentation must be administratively acceptable to
   the supervisor, must cover all absences beyond the third workday and specify that the
   employee was incapacitated for duty for the entire period covered by the statement. As a
   minimum, the health care provider should be requested to provide a diagnosis and an
   estimate of the expected date of full or partial recovery as provided in Attachment 1, Terms,
   “Medical Documentation” (3), (4) and (5). In cases of extended illness, medical
   documentation may be required periodically, if necessary to establish the employee’s
   continued incapacity to return to duty. For employees on uncommon tours of duty (such as
   firefighters) scheduled on a “24 hour on, 24 hours off” basis, sick leave for more than 2
   consecutive 24-hour duty periods must be supported by medical documentation unless the
   supervisor specifically waives this requirement. If there is any doubt as to the validity or
   adequacy of the medical documentation presented to support a request for sick leave, the
   medical officer at the installation may be requested to review the documentation submitted
   and with the employee’s permission, to consult the employee’s health care provider for
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                               19


   additional information. Where evidence does not justify the approval of sick leave, the
   employee may request to use some other paid or non-paid leave. The supervisor will consider
   the employee’s alternative absence request, and may either approve the employee’s request
   or charge the employee with AWOL, as appropriate.
   3.5.2. Absences Due to Contagious Disease. Sick leave due to exposure to contagious
   disease or the illness of a member of the immediate family with a contagious disease must be
   supported by medical documentation regardless of the length of the absence. When an
   employee requests sick leave because a family member has a contagious disease, the
   employee must present a statement from the attending physician or health care provider to
   show that the family member requires the employee’s care and attendance as well as the fact
   that the disease is subject to quarantine or isolation of the patient by public health authorities
   having jurisdiction. (See definition of contagious disease in Attachment 1.)
   3.5.3. Absences of 3 Days or Less. Ordinarily, except as in paragraph 3.5.2, medical
   documentation is normally not required for absences of 3 days or less. An employee who is
   absent frequently for short periods of illness may be advised to visit a health care provider for
   physical checkup or, if civilian medical facilities are available at the installation, may be
   offered a physical examination. When there is reason to believe that an employee is abusing
   sick leave, medical documentation may be required for absences of 3 days or less. Do not
   establish practices, which require: 1) submission of medical documentation by all employees
   for absences of 3 days or less; 2) checkup visits to the homes of all absentees, or 3) unduly
   complex procedures for the approval of sick leave.
3.6. Return to Duty After Illness. Any requirement for clearance with the medical facility
before returning to work must be limited to those specific cases where there is reason to believe
that presence at work would endanger the employee’s health or would constitute a health hazard
to others. The leave-approving official determines what is acceptable evidence of incapacity. If
necessary, the medical officer at the installation may be asked for assistance in making this
determination.
3.7. Substitution of Sick Leave for Annual Leave. If illness occurs during a period of annual
leave, sick leave may be substituted contingent upon submission of supporting evidence
acceptable to the supervisor, which may include the requirement for medical documentation.
3.8. Disabled Veterans. A disabled veteran who presents an administratively acceptable
statement from a physician or other duly constituted medical authority showing that medical
examination, treatment or absence in connection with the service-connected disability is required
must be granted all sick leave (including advanced sick leave), and all annual leave permitted by
law, plus any leave without pay that may be necessary to undergo treatment. Except for
emergency treatment, the granting of such leave is contingent upon the veteran’s giving prior
notice of the definite periods of required absence so that arrangements can be made for carrying
on the work during the absence.
3.9. Outside Employment During Sick Leave. As a general rule, sick leave is not approved
for a period of absence during which an employee engages in outside employment. Exception is
made when the nature of the employee’s illness or disability and the nature of the outside
employment make it clearly evident that the employee is still incapacitated for the regular job
while engaging in the outside employment. However, before engaging in outside employment
during a period of sick leave, the employee must notify the leave-approving official of the nature
 20                                                AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


of the employment and furnish acceptable evidence of incapacitation for duty. NOTE: Before
allowing an individual to engage in outside employment during a period of sick leave, the
supervisor must make every reasonable effort to furnish light duty or appropriate detail duties the
employee can perform.
3.10. Treatment of Injury in Performance of Duty. On the date of injury, an employee
injured in the performance of duty is considered to be in a duty status during the time required
for initial examination or emergency treatment by a federal physician or by a facility officially
authorized to treat employees injured on duty. An employee who suffers a traumatic on-the-job
injury may elect to use sick leave and/or annual leave or 45 days continuation of pay (COP). If
the claim is denied, the employee may request sick or annual leave to cover the period of
absence. An employee also has the option to “buy back” sick leave used in relation to a job-
related injury or illness. Employees are entitled to use any accrued and accumulated sick leave
to their credit when they suffer a work-related illness or disease. While awaiting adjudication of
a claim for compensation by the Office of Workers’ Compensation Program (OWCP), the
employee is entitled to use available sick or annual leave, or LWOP, as requested. However,
disability for wage loss compensation benefits may only be paid to employees for periods of
leave without pay. LWOP during OWCP determination and adjudication would be paid under 5
U.S.C. Chapter 81.
3.11. Use of Advance Sick Leave. An advance of sick leave is a privilege which may be
extended to employees. It is not considered a routine or standard procedure and will be granted
only after all circumstances have been carefully weighed. Advancing sick leave to an employee
so he or she can maintain the 80-hour balance requirement is prohibited. In case of serious
disability, illness, incapacitation, or confinement for childbirth, employees may be advanced up
to 30 workdays of sick leave, or equivalent for uncommon tours of duty based on each individual
instance. To determine the maximum amount of sick leave that can be advanced for an employee
on an uncommon tour of duty, multiply 240 hours by weekly hours in the uncommon tour and
divide by 40 (240 x weekly uncommon tour/40=maximum hours). Employees requesting
advanced sick leave to provide care for a family member or for bereavement purposes may be
advanced sick leave in an amount not to exceed the maximum allowable (40 hours per leave year
for full time employees). Requests for advanced sick leave may be made before or during the
period of absence but no later than the employee’s return to duty. See paragraph 3.3 for
additional information regarding sick leave for general family care and bereavement purposes.
   3.11.1. In granting advance sick leave consider: the employee’s prior sick leave history;
   annual leave versus sick leave balance history; length of continuous employment; and
   whether all accumulated sick leave to the employee’s credit has been exhausted. Also
   consider requiring the employee to use any annual leave which may be subject to forfeiture.
   3.11.2. When it is known that the employee is to be retired or otherwise separated, the total
   advance may not exceed an amount which can be liquidated by accrual before separation.
   3.11.3. An application for advance sick leave must be supported by medical documentation
   signed by a physician or health care provider. The medical documentation should normally
   address items as defined in Attachment 1, and any other items, necessary for management to
   make a decision regarding the application. In all cases, a statement indicating the date the
   employee is expected to return to normal duties is required. NOTE: Supervisors are
   cautioned that only the information necessary to make a decision should be required.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                             21


   However, until the supervisor has sufficient information upon which to base a decision, no
   advance can be granted.
   3.11.4. Advance sick leave is not granted if it is considered likely that the employee will not
   return to duty for a sufficient period of time to repay the advanced leave, or there are
   insufficient funds in the employee’s retirement account to liquidate the indebtedness.
   3.11.5. Advance sick leave is liquidated automatically through accrual of sick leave after the
   employee returns to work. Repayment is not required when separation is because of death,
   resignation for disability supported by acceptable medical documentation, or disability
   retirement.
   3.11.6. An unliquidated advance is carried forward from pay period to pay period and from
   one leave year to the next until liquidated by subsequent accrual. If the employee requests,
   advanced sick leave may be liquidated by a charge against an equivalent amount of annual
   leave. When an employee separates from federal service before liquidating the advance, the
   balance is liquidated in the following order by:
       3.11.6.1. Charge against available annual leave.
       3.11.6.2. Setoff against earned salary or unapplied savings bond balances.
       3.11.6.3. Request for retirement setoff.
3.12. Sick Leave to Care for a Family Member with a Serious Health Condition. An
eligible employee may use a total of up to 12 administrative workweeks of sick leave each leave
year to care for a family member with a serious health condition. If an employee previously has
used any portion of the 13 days of sick leave for general family care or bereavement purposes in
a leave year, that amount must be subtracted from the 12-week entitlement. If an employee has
already used 12 weeks of sick leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition,
he or she cannot use an additional 13 days in the same leave year for general family care
purposes. An employee is entitled to a total of 12 weeks of sick leave each year for all family
care purposes.
   3.12.1. Definition of a Family Member. The definition of a family member may be found at
   Attachment 1 of this instruction. The definition of a family member is the same as
   5 CFR 630.201(b).
   3.12.2. Serious Health Condition. A serious health condition has the same meaning as used
   in the Office of Personnel Management’s regulations for administering the Family and
   Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and may be found at Attachment 1 of this instruction.
   (See 5 CFR 630.1202.) This definition includes, but is not limited to, such conditions as
   cancer, heart attacks, heart conditions requiring heart bypass or valve operations, back
   conditions requiring extensive therapy or surgical procedures, kidney dialysis, physical
   therapy, strokes, severe injuries, severe respiratory conditions, spinal injuries, appendicitis,
   pneumonia, emphysema, severe arthritis, severe nervous disorders, injuries caused by serious
   accidents on or off the job, clinical depression, recovery from major surgery, final stages of a
   terminal illness, Alzheimer’s disease, pregnancy, and childbirth. This may include
   “emotional” support for a family member receiving nursing care or medical care in a medical
   facility. A serious health condition is not intended to cover short-term conditions for which
   treatment and recovery are very brief. The common cold, flu, earaches, upset stomach,
22                                                AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


  headaches (other than migraines), routine dental or orthodontia problems, etc., are not serious
  health conditions unless complications arise. Medical certification is required for a serious
  health condition.
     3.12.2.1. Medical Documentation. An employee must provide written medical
     certification to document the use of sick leave to care for a family member with a serious
     health condition. Requests shall be submitted to the approving official on an OPM Form
     71 or other appropriate form. The employee must provide written medical certification of
     a serious health condition, signed by the health care provider no later than 15 workdays
     after the date requested by the Air Force. (See definition of Medical Documentation at
     Attachment 1 for guidance.) An additional written statement must be provided from the
     health care provider concerning the family member’s need for psychological comfort
     and/or physical care. The statement must certify that the family member requires
     psychological comfort and/or physical care, the family member would benefit from the
     employee’s care or presence, and the specific length of time the employee is needed to
     care for the family member.
  3.12.3. Use of Sick Leave for Family Care. The same limitations apply to the use of sick
  leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition as apply to the use of sick
  leave for general family care or bereavement purposes. (See paragraph 3.3) A covered full-
  time employee may use 40 hours (5 workdays) of sick leave each leave year for these
  purposes. An employee may use additional sick leave for general family care or
  bereavement purposes or to care for a family member with a serious health condition if he or
  she maintains a balance of at least 80 hours of sick leave in his or her account. Only the first
  40 hours of sick leave (or a proportional amount for an employee on a part-time schedule or
  uncommon tour of duty) may be advanced. (See paragraph 3.11)
  3.12.4. Relationship to Voluntary Leave Transfer Program. Employees approved for the
  voluntary leave transfer program are required to use their sick leave before using donated
  annual leave. Under this program, an employee may receive donated annual leave from other
  employees if he or she is affected by a personal or family medical emergency and has
  exhausted his or her available paid annual and sick leave. (See Chapter 9.)
     3.12.4.1. An employee faced with a family medical emergency who has exhausted his or
     her entitlement to 12 weeks of sick leave for family care purposes (or a lesser amount if
     the employee has not accrued 12 weeks of sick leave) may receive donated annual leave.
     In addition, an employee who is using donated annual leave on the effective date of the
     new sick leave policy is required to use all of his or her sick leave available for family
     care purposes before he or she can continue to use donated annual leave.
  3.12.5. Childbirth and Newborns. Pregnant employees are entitled to use sick leave for
  prenatal and postnatal medical appointments and any periods of incapacitation as a result of
  pregnancy and childbirth. A biological mother or father cannot use 12 weeks of sick leave to
  care for a healthy newborn, but only for one with a serious health condition. A parent may
  use annual leave or leave without pay to care for a healthy newborn.

                                           Chapter 4

                                  LEAVE WITHOUT PAY

4.1. When Leave Without Pay (LWOP) Is Granted. LWOP is a temporary nonpay status and
an authorized absence from duty granted only upon the employee’s request, in situations such as
when the employee has insufficient annual or sick leave, or compensatory time available to cover
an approved absence. An employee does not have to exhaust annual leave before requesting
LWOP. LWOP cannot be imposed as a penalty, nor can an employee be required to apply for
LWOP in lieu of suspension. It must not be confused with absence without leave (AWOL),
which is charged for unauthorized absence, or absence for which the employee did not request
and obtain approval of leave. Even though the reason for requesting LWOP is known to be
legitimate, e.g., illness, injury, or personal emergency, the request may be denied if the
employee’s services are required or if the employee has not followed prescribed leave
procedures. The granting of LWOP is a matter of administrative discretion except as specified
below. Even though LWOP is a nonpay status, it is still approved leave and must be requested by
the employee and approved by the supervisor. An employee must work an established regular
tour of duty during the administrative workweek in order to qualify for leave benefits. (See
5 U.S.C. 6301(2)(B)(ii).) Regularly scheduled work is defined in 5 CFR 610.102 as work that is
scheduled in advance of an administrative workweek under the agency’s procedures for
establishing workweeks.
   4.1.1. LWOP Mandated by Law.            LWOP must be granted in the following three
   circumstances to:
       4.1.1.1. A disabled veteran to cover an absence for medical treatment related to a
       service-connected disability. (See Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment
       Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA).)
       4.1.1.2. A member of the Reserve or National Guard to perform military training and/or
       active duty. All periods of LWOP for this purpose must be documented in personnel and
       pay systems as LWOP-US (see paragraph 4.5). An employee does not have to be a
       Reservist or National Guardsman in order to be granted mandatory LWOP-US. (See
       USERRA.)
       4.1.1.3. An employee who requests LWOP under the Family and Medical Leave Act
       (FMLA).
   4.1.2. LWOP Mandated by Regulation. If the employee has followed leave procedures, the
   granting of LWOP is mandatory under the following circumstances:
       4.1.2.1. For protecting an employee’s status and benefits pending action by the Office of
       Workers’ Compensation Programs (OWCP) on a claim resulting from a work-related
       illness or injury or during a period the employee is carried on the rolls while being
       compensated by the OWCP. NOTE: If an employee who is receiving compensation
       payments is separated, it is more administratively difficult to return them to duty than if
       they had been retained in a LWOP status. This is due largely to requirements imposed by
       OWCP. If the employee meets the requisite requirements for continued Federal
       Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) and Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance
       (FEGLI) enrollment, transfer FEHB to OWCP after 10 months of LWOP and transfer
24                                              AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


     FEGLI to OWCP after 12 months of LWOP. (See FEHB and FEGLI Handbooks for
     additional guidance.) Employees receiving compensation should be retained in a LWOP
     status for 12 months rather than separated unless there is medical evidence of the
     employee being unable to return to work within that time. (See 5 CFR 353 for authority.)
     4.1.2.2. To avoid a break in service for career and career-conditional employees who are
     dependents of a military member or a federal civilian employee or who are dependents of
     an individual who is employed by a public or private sector organization and who must
     relocate because of the transfer of the head of the household. (Dependents of a public or
     private sector employee must provide acceptable evidence of the requirement to transfer.
     For DoD dependents, orders are acceptable evidence.) Such employees whose travel and
     transportation are covered by their sponsor’s eligibility, are granted LWOP upon their
     request for a period of up to 150 days to allow an opportunity to secure federal
     employment. A resignation SF-52 must be submitted along with the request for LWOP.
     The losing supervisor may fill behind immediately as long as the projected resignation
     SF-52 has also been submitted by the departing employee. Additional LWOP, up to 12
     months, may be granted at the option of the former leave-approving supervisor. Also
     eligible under this provision are former spouses of sponsors following death, divorce, or
     legal separation if they accompanied the sponsor on a permanent change of station to the
     current duty station. Because the purpose and conditions of appointment under the
     Schedule A dependent hire authority and under the overseas limited authority are meant
     only for employment in foreign areas, LWOP may not be granted to any employee
     serving under these authorities who is leaving that employment for return to the United
     States unless the employee has eligibility for appointment under Executive Order (EO)
     12362 (as amended by EO 12721), i.e., 12 months service in the overseas area. An
     employee who is granted LWOP has to perform duty on the last duty day prior to the start
     of the LWOP. It is not appropriate to exhaust annual leave before LWOP in cases where
     the basis for LWOP is that the employee must relocate because of the transfer of the head
     of household. This means they are not expected to return to work. Annual leave is only
     appropriate in instances where the employee is expected to return to work. (See
     paragraph 2.4.2 for additional guidance on terminal leave.)
     4.1.2.3. Seasonal employees are placed in a nonpay status, not in a LWOP status, when
     released from duty due to workload requirements or seasonal nature of work. Seasonal
     employees may be granted LWOP from their regular scheduled tour of duty at their
     request IAW the provisions of this chapter.
  4.1.3. LWOP in Other Circumstances. LWOP in other cases should be granted only when it
  is apparent that it will result in increased job capability, protection or improvement of the
  employee’s health, or the retention of a desirable employee. Circumstances in which the
  approval of LWOP is discretionary include (but are not limited to) the following:
     4.1.3.1. For educational purposes when the course of study is in line with work
     performed within the Air Force and completion of the course would serve the best
     interests of the Air Force.
     4.1.3.2. For protecting the rights and benefits of employees who must relocate because of
     an emergency family situation.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                            25


       4.1.3.3. For temporary service with a non-federal or private enterprise when it will
       contribute to the public welfare or when the experience to be gained will benefit the Air
       Force.
       4.1.3.4. For service with a recognized employee organization.
       4.1.3.5. For protecting an employee’s status and benefits pending final action by the
       Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on a claim for disability retirement, after all sick
       and annual leave have been exhausted.
       4.1.3.6. For recovery from illness or disability not of a permanent nature.
       4.1.3.7. For protecting the rights and benefits of employees who request to remain at
       home to care for a newborn, newly adopted, or sick minor child. (See Chapter 10 for
       more information on Family and Medical Leave.)
4.2. Amount of LWOP. There is no maximum prescribed by law or regulation on the amount
of LWOP which can be granted. Costs and inconveniences to the Air Force as a result of
granting extended LWOP include encumbrance of a position, loss of services, complication of
retention registers in the event of reduction in force, obligation to provide active employment at
the end of the approved leave period, credit of 6 months of each year towards retirement without
employee contributions, eligibility for continued coverage under FEGLI (without cost to the
employee for up to 1 year of nonpay status), and payment of the employer’s share of health
insurance premiums for LWOP up to 365 days.
4.3. When LWOP is Not Granted. LWOP is not granted to an employee who is being
returned from overseas at government expense for separation.
4.4. Who Approves LWOP. Supervisors authorized to approve annual and sick leave
determine (subject to any higher administrative approval required locally) when requests for
LWOP for 1 year or less may be granted. LWOP of more than 30 consecutive days must be
made a matter of record in the Official Personnel Folder. Supervisors are required to submit a
Request for Personnel Action (RPA) through the CPF to the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC)
or a SF 52, Request for Personnel Action, to the local CPF prior to granting LWOP of more
than 30 days. Initial grants of LWOP may not exceed 12 months. If an additional grant is deemed
justified, the employee’s request for extension must be submitted to the installation commander
or designee for approval. An extension beyond 1 year may be approved only when it is in the
interest of the federal service, or when it is determined that, because of unusual circumstances,
the employee would be subjected to undue hardship if the extension were denied.
4.5. Leave Without Pay-Uniformed Services (LWOP-US). LWOP-US is leave of absence to
perform duty with the uniformed services. An employee does not have to be a Reservist or
National Guardsman in order to be granted mandatory LWOP-US. When civilian employees in
the Reserve or the National Guard perform military duty, document all periods of LWOP-US of
at least one day’s duration on the SF-50 including actions of 30 days or less. This will enable
personnel/payroll offices to have a record of military service deposits for retirement purposes
and will entitle employees to make up contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).
4.6. LWOP for Attendance at School Functions. Parents are authorized up to 24 hours of
LWOP in a leave year for participation in school activities directly related to the educational
advancement of their children. This includes, but is not limited to, parent-teacher conferences or
 26                                            AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


meetings with child-care providers, interviewing for a new school or child-care facility, or
participating in volunteer activities to support the child’s educational advancement.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                                27


                                             Chapter 5

                                       MILITARY LEAVE

5.1. Military Leave Explained. Military leave is absence from duty in the employee’s civilian
position without loss of pay (including pay for regularly scheduled overtime) to perform military
duty. Eligible employees must, upon request, be granted military leave to which entitled for
performance of active duty, active duty for training, or inactive-duty training (as defined in
section 101 of title 37). As a result of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment
Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), if an employee is ordered to an initial period of active duty for
training or inactive-duty training with the Reserve or National Guard, the employee may be
granted military leave, annual leave, previously-earned compensatory time off, previously-
earned credit hours, previously-earned time-off award, or LWOP-US, as requested. Military
leave does not have to be exhausted first and may be intermingled with other appropriate types of
leave to perform military duty. However, if the employee (except a temporary employee) is to
continue on active duty for an extended period (usually more than 1 year), the employee must be
placed in LWOP-US status unless the employee elects to use other leave or freely and knowingly
provides written notice of intent not to return to a position of employment with the agency, in
which case the employee can be separated. (See 5 CFR 353.106(a).)
5.2. Eligibility Criteria. Employees entitled to military leave must meet the following criteria:
   5.2.1. Be a member of a Reserve or National Guard component.
   5.2.2. Be a full-time, part-time, or indefinite employee who does not have an intermittent
   work schedule.
   5.2.3. Be serving in an appointment that is not limited to 1 year or less. NOTE: Although
   an employee may serve longer than 1 year on successive temporary appointments, there is no
   eligibility until the employee serves under an appointment that is not limited to 1 year or less.
5.3. Military Leave Entitlement. An eligible full-time employee with a regularly scheduled
40-hour workweek or 80-hour pay period who is a member in the Reserve of the armed forces or
a member of the National Guard accrues 15 days/120 hours (15 days x 8 hours) of military leave
each fiscal year. Eligible part-time or uncommon tours of duty employees earn an equivalent of
three workweeks of military leave each fiscal year based upon their schedule. For example,
employees with a 53-hour workweek accrue 159 hours of military leave each fiscal year;
employees with a 60-hour workweek accrue 180 hours, and employees with a 72-hour workweek
accrue 216 hours of military leave. Any military leave (not to exceed 15 days/120 hours), which
is unused at the end of a fiscal year, is carried forward to the next fiscal year and is available for
use in addition to the days/hours credited for the new fiscal year. This means that an employee
may have a maximum of the equivalent of 30 days military leave available for use during a fiscal
year. An employee who is a member of the Reserve or National Guard who is not eligible for, or
who has exhausted his or her military leave, must be granted annual leave, previously-earned
time off award, credit hours, or LWOP-US, as requested, in order to perform active or inactive
duty for training. An employee on military duty cannot use sick leave.
   5.3.1. Part-Time Military Leave Entitlement. Part-time career or career-conditional
   employees who are on a regularly scheduled tour of duty of 16 to 32 hours a week accrue
   military leave at a rate determined by dividing 40 into the number of hours in the regularly
 28                                                 AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


   scheduled workweek during the fiscal year and multiplying by 15. (Example: A regularly
   scheduled part-time employee works 20 hours per week. That employee’s entitlement to
   military leave is 20 divided by 40 x 15.) NOTE: Part-time employees who work less than 16
   hours per week are not entitled to military leave.
5.4. How Military Leave Accumulates. On 1 October of each fiscal year, or upon
appointment, military leave is credited to an eligible employee’s account (prorated for part-time
employees). Unused military leave remaining from the prior fiscal year, not to exceed 15
days/120 hours, is also credited.
5.5. Military Leave for Law Enforcement Purposes. When a member of the Reserve or the
National Guard is ordered to perform full-time active duty for law enforcement (see 5 U.S.C.
6323(b)), military leave not to exceed 22 workdays in a calendar year is authorized. The 22
workdays are converted to 176 hours and may be charged hourly. This military leave can be
granted only for absence during the employee’s regularly scheduled tour of duty, including
regularly scheduled overtime. It cannot be granted for military duty performed within a period of
nonpay status. Under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5519, an employee’s civilian pay is reduced by
the amount (other than a travel, transportation, or per diem allowance) received by the employee
for military service as a member of the Reserve or National Guard for a period for which he/she
is granted military leave under this provision.
5.6. Military Leave for Parades or Encampments. Members of the National Guard of the
District of Columbia, (see 5 U.S.C. 6323(c)) who are ordered to serve during a parade or
encampment are entitled to unlimited military leave for all days on which such duty is
performed. Any pay the employee receives while on military leave for parades or encampments
(other than travel, transportation, or per diem allowance) will be credited against the pay
received in the civilian position during the employee’s absence to perform the military duty.
5.7. Conditions for Granting Military Leave. An eligible employee is granted any available
military leave, annual leave, previously-earned compensatory time off, previously-earned credit
hours, previously-earned time off award, or LWOP-US when they perform active duty or
inactive duty. When an employee is on active duty, a copy of the orders normally accompanies
the request for military leave. Other types of military duty may be approved based on the
employee’s request. Supervisors may request additional documentation. The employee may be
required to submit a certification by the appropriate military official that the military duty was
performed. Normally, Reserve active and inactive duty is planned and announced in advance.
Employees are encouraged to provide, if possible, copies of annual training schedules as well as
advance notice of specific training dates.
5.8. How Military Leave Is Charged. Military leave granted is charged on an hourly basis.
Employees will not be charged military leave for non-duty days (typically weekends and
holidays) that occur within the period of military service. Employees requesting military leave
for active duty or inactive duty training (sometimes less than 8 hours) will be charged only the
amount of military leave necessary to cover the period of military duty or period of training and
necessary travel. Hours in the civilian workday that are not chargeable to military leave must be
worked or charged to another leave category, as appropriate. No charge is made for nonworkdays
at the beginning and end of a period of absence on active military duty. In addition, no leave is
charged for the first day of the active duty tour if the employee is not required to report for
military duty until after the civilian duty day ends, and no leave is charged for the last day of the
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                                 29


active duty tour if the employee is completely released from active duty prior to the start of the
next civilian duty day. If the military tour or consecutive tours is completely covered by annual
leave, LWOP-US, previously-earned compensatory time off, previously-earned credit hours, or
any combination thereof, military leave is not charged.
   5.8.1. When Used for Law Enforcement. Military leave granted for law enforcement
   purposes is charged on all days the employee would otherwise have worked and received
   pay, including days on which the employee was scheduled to work overtime on a regular
   basis. No charge is made to military leave for holidays or for any other day established by
   Executive or Administrative Order as a nonworkday not chargeable to leave. Military leave
   for employees using the 22 days of military leave granted for law enforcement purposes is
   charged in units of hours. The 22 days of law enforcement leave are converted to 176 hours
   and charged on the same basis as annual and sick leave. For example, an employee with 22
   additional days of military leave for law enforcement purposes works a 4-day workweek (10
   hours per day), Tuesday through Friday. He or she is absent Tuesday and Wednesday to
   perform law enforcement duty. The employee would be charged 10 hours of military leave
   for law enforcement purposes on Tuesday and another 10 hours for Wednesday and have a
   balance of 156 hours remaining. Under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5519, an employee’s
   civilian pay is reduced by the amount (other than a travel, transportation, or per diem
   allowance) received by the employee for military service as a member of the Reserve or
   National Guard for a period for which he is granted military leave under this provision. In
   short, an employee is entitled to the greater of his or her civilian or military pay, but not both.
   However, an employee may choose to take annual leave, traditional 15-day military leave,
   accrued credit hours, previously-earned time off award, or accrued compensatory time off
   instead of this type of military leave in order to retain both their full civilian and full military
   pay.
   5.8.2. When Applied to Alternative Work Schedules. Military leave for employees on
   alternative work schedules accrues at the same rate as for employees on fixed work
   schedules, based on the number of hours worked per pay period. Employees working flexible
   or compressed work schedules of 80 hours per pay period accrue 120 hours of military leave
   each fiscal year. Military leave is still charged on an hourly basis. Ten hours of military leave
   will be charged for a full day of military duty on regularly scheduled 10-hour workdays, nine
   hours of military leave will be charged on regularly scheduled 9-hour workdays, etc.
   5.8.3. When Applied to Active Duty Tours. Federal employees, who are also reservists
   including Air Reserve Technicians (ARTs) who are on LWOP-US while serving on an
   extended active duty (EAD) tour that spans 2 or more fiscal years, accrue 120 hours (or
   equivalent) of military leave at the beginning of the fiscal year. Reservists may use military
   leave at any time during the EAD tour or carry over up to 15 days as explained in paragraph
   5.3
5.9. Other Types of Absences Related to Military Duty.
   5.9.1. Physical Examinations for Duty in the Armed Forces. An employee is excused
   without charge to leave or loss of pay for the time required for physical examination before
   induction or recall to active duty in the armed forces. (The term induction includes
   volunteering for military service.) An absence in excess of 1 day requires a justifying
   statement from the examining station. An employee required to report for periodic physical
 30                                                 AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


   examinations for retention of status in any Reserve component or the National Guard is
   granted sick leave for the absence under regulations applicable to approval of sick leave for
   medical examination.
   5.9.2. Entry into the Armed Forces. An employee who reports for induction or is recalled to
   extended active duty in the armed forces is carried in a leave status (military leave, annual
   leave, compensatory time off, credit hours, previously-earned time off award, or LWOP-US)
   until the CPF is notified that the employee has been inducted or accepted for extended active
   duty, or if the employee is rejected, until the employee returns to duty or separation action is
   effected. A member of the Reserve or National Guard may request to use all military leave to
   which entitled before separation for military service. A Reservist called to active duty for
   training to satisfy an initial military obligation of at least 6 months in conjunction with a
   Reserve assignment is granted a leave of absence. An employee not eligible for military
   leave or who has exhausted his or her military leave may request to use any available annual
   leave, previously-earned compensatory time off, previously-earned time off award, or
   LWOP-US pending acceptance or rejection for military duty.
   5.9.3. Funeral Honors Duty. An employee who is a member of the Reserve or National
   Guard may use military leave to perform military “funeral honors duty”. Military leave for
   this purpose should be charged for all hours of the civilian duty day necessary to cover the
   funeral honors duty and necessary travel. (Ref P.L. 107-107, Sections 562 and 563.)
5.10. Additional Leave for Military Technicians. In addition to the military leave available as
described above, effective 10 Feb 1996, military technicians are entitled to 44 additional
workdays of military leave in a calendar year when on active duty without pay for participation
in operations outside the United States, its territories, and possessions. This includes
participation in operations outside the United States, its territories and possessions but controlled
by a technician physically located inside the United States, its territories or possessions, e.g.,
operating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) overseas from a stateside location. The active duty
orders must cite 10 U.S.C. 12315, 12301(b), or 12301(d) to be eligible for this entitlement. The
44 workdays are converted into hours and are charged on the same basis as annual leave.
(Example: Military reserve technicians who work 80-hour pay periods (including those on
flexible and compressed work schedules) are entitled to a maximum of 352 hours (8 x 44 =
352).) Those with uncommon tours of duty accrue the amount of authorized leave according to
their work schedule. The 44 workdays or a portion thereof, cannot be carried over into the next
calendar year. It is appropriate to use this leave on the day of deployment from home station, any
intervening stops within the United States, its territories and possessions, and the day of return to
home station as long as the ultimate destination on the military orders is an overseas location and
any intermediate destinations/stops are part of the continuing mission. In order to receive any
pay for a civilian non-workday, a change to "active duty with pay" status is required. This
requires use of a separate AF Form 938 for each period of conversion. Changes to civilian duty
status on workdays during the same military tour are also authorized, and require either the use
of a DD Form 1610, AF Form 3956, or AF Form 40A. Use of this military leave is at the
employee's discretion.
5.11. Military Leave for Mobilized Federal Civilian Employees. On 24 November 2003,
Section 1113 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 108-
136) amended subsection (b) of section 6323 of title 5, United States Code (5 U.S.C. 6323), by
adding a new authority for use of the additional 22 days of military leave provided under this
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                              31


statute. Employees who are called or ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation
as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13) and are members of the Reserves or the National Guard are
entitled to the additional 22 workdays of military leave per calendar year. This applies to military
service performed on or after 24 November 2003. For payroll reporting purposes, this new type
of leave will be coded as “LL”, just as the military leave for law enforcement purposes is coded.
Under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5519, an employee’s civilian pay is reduced by the amount
(other than a travel, transportation, or per diem allowance) received by the employee for military
service as a member of the Reserve or National Guard for a period for which the employee is
granted military leave under this provision. In short, an employee is entitled to the greater of his
or her civilian or military pay, but not both. However, an employee may choose to take annual
leave, traditional 15-day military leave, accrued credit hours, previously-earned time off award,
or accrued compensatory time off instead of this type of military leave in order to retain both
their full civilian and full military pay.

                                            Chapter 6

                                        COURT LEAVE

6.1. Court Leave Explained. Court leave is leave of absence from duty without loss of pay or
charge to annual leave to perform jury duty in a federal, state, or municipal court or to serve as a
witness for the United States, the District of Columbia, or state or local government. This
includes absence during periods of regularly scheduled overtime as well as absence during the
employee’s regularly scheduled basic workweek. For the purpose of granting court leave, a
military court is considered the same as a federal court.
6.2. Who Is Eligible. A permanent or temporary employee with a regularly scheduled tour of
duty (part-time or full-time) is eligible for court leave. Employees serving on an intermittent or
when-actually-employed basis are not eligible for court leave.
6.3. Granting Court Leave. Court leave is granted for absence during an employee’s regularly
scheduled tour of duty including regularly scheduled overtime. It can be granted only for those
days and hours the employee would otherwise be in a pay status. An employee cannot be
granted court leave for jury or witness duty performed within a period of nonpay status. If the
employee’s absence is properly chargeable to court leave, the employee cannot elect to have the
absence charged to annual leave. If an employee is on annual leave when called for jury duty or
witness service, court leave shall be substituted. No charge shall be made to annual leave for the
court service.
   6.3.1. Jury Duty. Because of the importance of trial by jury as an American system of
   justice, it is Air Force policy not to request that an employee be excused from jury service on
   the basis of Air Force employment, except in cases of extreme necessity. Effective
   administration of court leave also requires the exercise of good judgment in order to avoid
   imposing hardship on employees. Employees assigned to night shifts or standby tours of
   duty are granted court leave comparable with employees assigned to regular day shift work.
   Since jury or witness duty generally requires an employee’s presence in court during daytime
   hours, an employee who is scheduled to work at night is granted court leave during the day
   on which the night shift begins or ends. If the employee works during part of the regularly
   scheduled night shift, only that part of the regularly scheduled shift during which the
   employee is absent is charged to court leave. If the employee works a full, regular night
   shift, no court leave is charged, see paragraph 6.4
   6.3.2. Witness Service. Court leave is granted for employees who are summoned as a
   witness on behalf of any party in connection to any judicial proceeding to which the United
   States, the District of Columbia, or a state or local government is a party. NOTE: An
   employee who is summoned by the courts or assigned by the Air Force to testify in an
   official capacity or to produce official records on behalf of any party in any judicial
   proceeding is performing official duty and is not entitled to court leave, but is in an official
   duty status for the time involved.
   6.3.3. Leave for Participation in Suits Between Private Individuals and Companies. Court
   suits between private individuals or companies in which the United States, the District of
   Columbia, or a state or local government is not an involved party do not entitle employees to
   court leave. Therefore, the time the employee-plaintiff spends testifying in his or her own
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                                33


   behalf does not meet the requirement of having been summoned; therefore, granting court
   leave is not appropriate.
   6.3.4. Employee as Plaintiff in Suit Against the Government. When an employee-plaintiff
   has been deposed (called to give a deposition) or otherwise summoned to testify in a case in
   which a party in the proceeding is the United States, the District of Columbia, or a state or
   local government, the employee-plaintiff is a “witness” and is entitled to court leave for the
   time involved in giving a deposition or being a witness. When an employee is a party in a
   suit against the government, the time the employee-plaintiff spends in preparation for the trial
   and answering the government’s interrogatories, as well as the time spent observing the
   conduct of the trial do not qualify as court leave. Annual leave or LWOP is appropriate for
   such periods. However, if and when the employee-plaintiff prevails in a civil action against
   the government which is related to or caused by a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
   then the employee is entitled to restoration of leave charged. (See 42 U.S.C. 2000e-16.)
   6.3.5. Testimony in Title VII Proceedings. In a proceeding under Title VII of the Civil
   Rights Act of 1964, federal employees are in an official duty status when they appear as
   witnesses or are required to provide sworn statements. Witnesses who are Air Force
   employees and who are summoned to testify on behalf of the plaintiff in a civil action under
   Title VII against the Air Force are entitled to the same benefits with respect to pay status
   while attending court as persons who testify on behalf of the Air Force. Similarly, Air Force
   employees who are plaintiffs in such cases are entitled to official time for attendance in court
   at their trial. These entitlements flow from Title VII, which takes precedence over any
   contrary provision of any collective bargaining agreement or other regulation.
6.4. Return to Duty Upon Release by Court. An employee properly summoned by a state or
federal court to serve on a jury is under the jurisdiction and control of the court for the term of
the jury service. However, an employee is expected to return to duty during periods when the
employee is excused from jury duty unless this would be impractical. An employee excused or
discharged by the court either for an indefinite period in excess of 1 day or a substantial portion
thereof, is not entitled to court leave, but must report to duty. As a general rule, if there are 4 or
more hours remaining in the employee’s workday, exclusive of reasonable travel time, the
employee should report for duty. If the employee fails to report for duty as directed, annual
leave, previously-earned compensatory time off, LWOP, or absence without leave is charged for
the excess time involved.
6.5. Procedure for Recording Court Leave. When an employee is called for jury or witness
duty, the court order, subpoena, summons, or official request is given to the supervisor as soon as
possible. The days and hours of court leave are entered on the OPM 71 or other appropriate
form. When the employee returns to duty, the employee submits written evidence of attendance
in court showing the dates and hours, if possible. If required, the supporting documents are
forwarded to the payroll office with the time and attendance report that includes the court leave
entry.
6.6. Witness and Jury Fees and Expenses. An employee is entitled to receive and retain
expenses paid for services rendered and reimbursement for travel expenses. When a state or
local court characterizes jury and witness fees as expenses, there is no requirement for the
employee to turn in such fees to the agency. The employee cannot retain fees received in most
circumstances.     The certificate of attendance should separately identify fees and
 34                                                   AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


expenses/allowances. Fees received by the employee are collected while the expenses are not. If
the certificate of attendance does not identify expenses separately, all monies are considered fees
and shall be collected. The employee must submit fees received for jury or witness services by
money order or personal check to the servicing DFAS office. The employee may keep
reimbursements for expenses received from the court, authority, or party that caused the
employee to be summoned and may keep fees that exceed the employee’s compensation for the
days of service. An employee serving on a jury in a state or local court who waives or refuses to
accept fees is still liable to the U.S. Government for the fees he or she would have received.
Fees not submitted in a timely manner are subject to payroll deduction. Payroll deductions to
collect the fees will be made in the next regular pay period. If fees are erroneously paid to an
employee by the court, the fees paid cannot be retained by the employee and must be turned in to
the employing activity. When a holiday occurs during the time an employee is on jury duty or
witness service, the employee can keep the jury duty or witness service fee for the holiday. If an
employee is called to jury duty on a nonworkday, or during a non-pay status, the employee may
keep the fees paid. Table 6.1 is a guide to be used in connection with court and court-related
services. It indicates the varying conditions for absences and the proper time and attendance
recording for each. It also indicates an employee’s right to retention of fees for services
rendered. The employee must turn in any fees or compensation that cannot be retained to the
civilian payroll office.

                                             Chapter 7

                               ADMINISTRATIVE DISMISSAL

7.1. Administrative Dismissal. Administrative dismissal is an absence from duty when
employees are released from duty because all or part of an activity is closed, or it is in the public
interest. Employees affected by these actions are generally excused without charge to leave and
without loss of pay. In some instances, employees are placed on annual leave.
7.2. Closing an Activity. The installation commander is authorized to close all or part of an
activity and to excuse employees administratively consistent with the policy outlined in this
subchapter. This authority does not extend to periods of interrupted or suspended operations that
can be anticipated enough in advance to permit arranging for assignment to other work or the
scheduling of annual leave.
7.3. Authority to Grant Absence Due to Emergency Conditions or for Managerial
Reasons. The installation commander may issue administrative orders as prescribed in DoD
1400.25-M, DoD Civilian Personnel Manual, Subchapter 610, Hours of Duty and Subchapter
630, Leave relieving employees:
   7.3.1. For managerial reasons.
   7.3.2. When emergency conditions exist.
   7.3.3. When normal operations are interrupted by events beyond the control of management
   or employees.
   7.3.4. When it is in the public interest to relieve employees from duty.
7.4. Group Dismissal. When normal operations of an activity are interrupted by events beyond
the control of management or employees, employees (except certain temporary wage employees)
may be excused or their absence charged to available annual leave. The authority to excuse
employees under administrative dismissal orders is used sparingly and only for short periods of
time. However, employees cannot be excused without charge to leave when operations are
suspended for managerial reasons known enough in advance to permit the scheduling of leave.
Normally, employees are notified 24 hours in advance that they will be placed in a leave status,
but where this is impractical, employees may be placed on annual leave if they are notified by
the close of the preceding workday. In arriving at a decision to close all or part of an activity, the
commander must:
   7.4.1. Consider the practice of private employers in the community.
   7.4.2. Provide for liberal use of annual and sick leave in individual cases. For example,
   before considering any group dismissal because of temperature extremes, grant leave to
   employees with chronic medical conditions, which, according to the written advice of their
   attending health care provider, could be aggravated by temperature extremes.
   7.4.3. Assure that group dismissals of employees in connection with extreme weather
   conditions are authorized only in exceptional instances where working or commuting
   conditions are unusually severe and health of employees is endangered.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                              37


   7.4.4. When, because of planned managerial reasons, the closing of all or part of an activity
   is required for short periods of time, notify employees no less than one full work shift in
   advance and require them to take annual leave, unless leave without pay is requested.
   Employees may be advanced annual leave to cover such an absence.
   7.4.5. Ensure group dismissal authority is not used to create a holiday or as a reward for
   performance. For example, it must not be used to grant a “day off” for the Friday following
   Thanksgiving or in conjunction with any other holiday, or a “family/down day”
   commensurate with those granted for active duty military members.
7.5. Absence Due to Environmental Conditions. Dismissals due to environmental conditions,
which cause an adverse work environment such as temperature extremes and plumbing and
lighting malfunctions, should be rare. These conditions must be corrected as soon as possible.
Employees are expected to work if conditions of the workplace are reasonably adequate.
Individual employees affected by environmental conditions may be granted leave. Management
should consider alternate work sites. Before administrative excusal may be granted, it must be
clearly established by reasonable standards of judgment that the conditions are such as to
actually prevent working. When early dismissal is authorized, affected employees in a duty
status at the time set for dismissal are excused without charge to leave. For employees who are
scheduled to report for duty after an initial period of leave, and dismissal is given before the
employee can report, leave is charged until the time set for dismissal. Employees who leave
before the scheduled dismissal time, or who are already in a leave status and scheduled to be in a
leave status during the time of dismissal, continue to be charged leave.
7.6. Absence Due to Hazardous Weather Conditions or Disasters. Group dismissals of
employees without charge to leave because of severe storm, snow or icing conditions, or
disasters occurring during or outside regular duty hours may be authorized in accordance with
the guidelines in DoD 1400.25-M. These guidelines must be followed by installation
commanders in making group dismissal determinations. To ensure orderly evacuation of
employees who can be released from duty, and continued maintenance of essential operations,
establish local procedures for official notification of group dismissals to all activities and the
designation of those functions which must continue to be manned under all weather conditions
for reasons of health, safety, and national security. In geographical areas (defined as areas within
which employees normally commute to work) where the conditions affect more than one
Defense activity, the commander of the activity employing the largest number of civilian
employees must make the determination if an emergency exists and assess its impact on the
employees, using the guidelines in DoD 1400.25-M. Decisions by other individual commanders
within the geographical area at variance with the decision of the major geographical commander
must be coordinated with the latter. Group dismissal announcements for Air Force activities in
the Washington DC area are controlled by procedures developed by OPM. Under group
dismissal conditions, employees are excused or charged leave as follows:
   7.6.1. Early Dismissal. Only employees who are in a duty status (not on leave) or who are
   expected to return from leave to duty status at the time the early dismissal takes effect are
   excused without charge to leave. Employees who are absent on leave that day continue to be
   charged leave.
   7.6.2. Late Reporting. Depending on hazardous weather conditions, tardiness not in excess
   of 2 hours may be excused. Tardiness in excess of 2 hours may also be excused because of
 38                                               AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


   an unavoidable delay resulting from adverse weather or from disruption of public or private
   transportation in individual cases which are personally reviewed by appropriate supervisors.
   In case of employees who do not report for duty during hazardous weather, annual leave is
   charged for the full duty day, unless the supervisor concerned determines, after personal
   review of the facts in each case, that the employee made every reasonable effort to get to
   work, but was unable to do so because of the weather conditions. Determining factors for
   consideration in the decision include: Distance between the employee’s residence and place
   of work, and mode of transportation.
   7.6.3. Base Closure. Workdays in which federal activities are closed for hazardous weather
   conditions or disasters are nonworkdays for leave purposes. All regular employees, except
   those required to perform mission essential duties, are excused without charge to leave. This
   includes those on scheduled annual, sick leave, or telework, but does not include those in a
   nonpay/LWOP status on the days immediately before and after the day(s) the activity was
   closed. These employees remain in a nonpay/LWOP status. In addition, it does not apply to
   employees on military duty or suspension on the day of the closure. Employees who are
   assigned to other activities but are TDY at the closed activity are entitled to excusal without
   charge to leave. Employees who are assigned to the affected activity but are TDY elsewhere,
   are not entitled to excusal without charge to leave.
7.7. Miscellaneous Provisions:
   7.7.1. Labor Disputes in Private Plants. When employees are prevented from working
   because of temporary shutdowns due to labor disputes at a private plant to which they are
   assigned, every effort must be made to assign them to other work. If that is not possible,
   such employees may be dismissed without charge to leave for a maximum of 5 days.
   7.7.2. Planned Shutdowns in Private Plants. When private plants are to close based on a
   planned shutdown such as Christmas or other scheduled holiday period, employees should
   not be dismissed without charge to leave, but should be carried in an appropriate leave status,
   i.e., annual leave, previously-earned compensatory time off, or leave without pay.

                                          Chapter 8

                                  EXCUSED ABSENCES

Section 8A—General Types of Absence

8.1. Excused Absence. There are numerous instances when employees are absent from their
normal assignments to perform acts or services officially sanctioned by management. In
performing these acts or services, employees remain under management control or jurisdiction
and are considered to be in a duty status. Supervisors are authorized to make individual
determinations that the act or service is job-related and not chargeable to leave and to place
reasonable limits on the length of such absences from normal assignments. Excused absence is
an administratively authorized absence from duty without loss of pay or charge to leave. The
leave approving supervisor may excuse employees only for the periods and the reasons specified
in this chapter. The installation commander or head of serviced organizations is authorized to
excuse employees for brief periods for any other reasons that are deemed to be in the best
interest of the public or the Air Force. Heads of serviced organizations are those individuals
whose activity is not located on an Air Force installation or are a separate Air Force agency.
Tenant commanders are not heads of serviced organizations. A “brief period” normally means
not more than 4 hours per day. Excused absence differs from administrative dismissal in that it
normally addresses individual employees being excused for non-mission related emergency
reasons, or for reasons the government encourages such as voting. Excused absence is not
authorized for non-duty periods, nor, as in the case of ARTs for the purposes of accomplishing
military requirements or military training, e.g., haircuts, chemical defense training, etc.

              advise the employee when participation may begin.
              8.1.2.1.2.3. (Added-AFISRA) Once approved, the request remains in effect
              until such time the employee withdraws the request.

           8.1.2.1.2.4. (Added-AFISRA) The supervisor may, at any time and without
           prior notice, modify or suspend the employee’s fitness schedule due to workload
           or mission requirements for specific day(s) or week(s).
           8.1.2.1.2.5. (Added-AFISRA) File the request form in the Supervisor Employee

           8.1.2.1.3.1. (Added-AFISRA) Participation in physical fitness activities may be
           used at anytime during the workday, in conjunction with other scheduled breaks
           (e.g. lunch break), or at the beginning or end of the workday.
           8.1.2.1.3.2. (Added-AFISRA) Authorize absences in 15 minute increments, but
           allow no more than 90 minutes on one workday. Ensure employee records each
           occurrence of physical fitness activities during normal workday on the time sheet
           with the code, LN (for excused absence) along with the remark, “physical
           fitness”.
           8.1.2.1.3.3. (Added-AFISRA) Time allowed participating in physical fitness
           activities includes travel time to and from on-base facilities and preparation time

        8.1.2.1.4. (Added-AFISRA) Revoke any employee’s authority to participate in the
        program if found abusing or misusing the privilege and if warranted, effect
        disciplinary action.
     8.1.2.2. (Added-AFISRA) The employee shall:
        8.1.2.2.1. (Added-AFISRA) Submit a written request to supervisor to participate in
        the program utilizing the sample in Attachment 1. No employee may participate in
        physical fitness activities during normal work hours until approved, in writing, by
        supervisor. The written request must include:
           8.1.2.2.1.1. (Added-AFISRA) A proposed schedule indicating the times and
           days of the week preferred to participate in the program.

        fitness activities with supervisor. Schedule changes directed by supervisor due to
        workload or mission requirements may not be challenged unless the decision appears
        arbitrary or capricious.
        8.1.2.2.3. (Added-AFISRA) Use this excused absence for no other purpose than to
        participate in physical fitness activities.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                             41

           when participating in physical fitness activities during normal work hours.
           8.1.2.2.5. (Added-AFISRA) Record each occurrence of physical fitness activities
           during normal work hours on time sheet with the code, LN (for excused absence)
           along with the remark, “physical fitness”.
           8.1.2.2.6. (Added-AFISRA) Immediately notify supervisor should ability to
           participate in physical fitness activities become limited in any manner.
           8.1.2.2.7. (Added-AFISRA) Participate in organized unit fitness activities or
           independently.
8.2. Emergency Rescue or Protective Work. An employee who can be spared without
interference to essential operations or obligations may be excused to participate as a volunteer in
emergency rescue or protective work during an emergency such as fire, flood, or search
operations. Normally, such participation is limited to a maximum of 5 days per year. An
employee cannot be excused from duty without charge to leave for the purpose of performing
rescue, Reserve, or National Guard duty which would otherwise be covered by military leave.
(See Chapter 5.)
   8.2.1. Employees called to emergency duty as members of the Civil Air Patrol, or a similar
   organization, are excused without charge to leave. After 5 workdays, any further absence is
   normally charged to available annual leave, previously-earned time-off award, previously-
   earned compensatory time off, or leave without pay as requested by the employee.
   8.2.2. Except as authorized above, employees participating in emergency rescue or
   protective work are charged leave or carried in a nonpay status for the total period of
   absence. Employees engaged in protective services, e.g., community “volunteer” firefighting
   (paid or not paid) would not qualify for excused absence, but may be granted annual leave,
   LWOP, etc.
8.3. Absence for Brief Periods or Tardiness. Unavoidable absences, brief periods of early
dismissal, and brief periods of tardiness of less than 1 hour may be excused by the supervisor or
he/she may provide the employee opportunity to request approved leave, earned credit hours, or
previously-earned compensatory time off. If the absence or tardiness is charged to annual leave,
the charge is in multiples of ¼ hour. If the leave charged exceeds the period of absence or
tardiness, the employee is not required to work the additional time covered by the leave charge.
Unauthorized absence during the workday also may be charged as absence without leave
(AWOL) if the circumstances do not justify excusing the absence or approving leave. The
charge of AWOL is not, itself, a disciplinary action. However, tardiness or an unauthorized
absence that is charged to AWOL may serve as the basis for disciplinary action. Such cases
should be discussed with representatives of the CPF to determine whether to take disciplinary
action and what type.
8.4. Absence for Voting or Registration. Activities should assemble and maintain up-to-date
information as to voting hours in all political subdivisions in which their employees reside. This
information should be made available to employees. On the basis of this information, activities
must determine the amount of excused absence to be permitted and must inform employees of
these determinations.
 42                                                  AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


   8.4.1. As a general rule, employees requesting time off to vote are excused without charge to
   leave for the amount of time necessary to permit them to report to work 3 hours after the
   polls open or to leave work 3 hours before the polls close, whichever requires the least
   amount of time off. Normally, where the polls are open either 3 hours before or 3 hours after
   the employee’s regular duty hours, no time off is granted. (This is the case in most
   jurisdictions.) Employees on flexible work schedules can be excused only for those hours
   which cannot be accommodated by their flexible schedule.
   8.4.2. Because of special circumstances, the general rule stated above may not permit
   sufficient time for voting, in which case the employee is excused for the additional time
   necessary, but not more than 1 workday.
   8.4.3. Where the employee’s voting place is beyond normal commuting distance, and voting
   by absentee ballot is not permitted, the employee is granted sufficient time off to make the
   trip. Time off in excess of 1 day is charged to annual leave, previously-earned compensatory
   time off, or leave without pay.
   8.4.4. The employee voting in jurisdictions where registration in person is required is
   granted time off to register on substantially the same basis as for voting. However, no time
   off is granted without charge to leave if the employee can register on a nonworkday and
   round-trip travel reasonably can be accomplished in 1 day.
8.5. Blood Donations. The Air Force encourages its employees to volunteer as blood donors
without compensation. An employee should be excused from work without charge to leave for
the time necessary to donate blood or blood products, such as platelets or plasma, for
recuperation following blood donation, and for necessary travel to and from the donation site.
The maximum excusable time should not exceed 4 hours, except in unusual cases. When the
employee must travel a long distance or when unusual need for recuperation occurs, up to an
additional 4 hours may be authorized. This does not cover an employee who gives blood for the
employee’s own use or receives compensation for giving blood. Employees who volunteer but
are rejected as donors for that visit must return to duty or elect paid leave.
8.6. Taking Examinations. Examinations specified as a qualification requirement for
competitive appointment to the position in which the employee is serving or required to establish
eligibility for assignment to another position, and given by, or taken at the request of the activity,
are considered as official duty and no leave is charged for the time off required to take the
examination. This applies to examinations administered by boards of the various states or other
jurisdictions and specified as satisfying the qualification requirements for competitive
appointment to a position in the federal service as well as examinations administered by the
OPM or a federal agency. Absence to take examinations other than those specified above is
charged to annual leave, previously-earned compensatory time off, or leave without pay.
8.7. Consultation With Operating Officials, EEO Counselor, Civilian Person nel Flight
Staff, and Employment Interviews. Do not charge an employee leave:
   8.7.1. For the time required to consult with operating officials, EEO Counselor, or the staff
   of the CPF on matters relating to their employment provided that arrangements satisfactory
   to the employee’s supervisor and the official to be consulted are made in advance.
   8.7.2. While representing a labor organization, if use of official time is authorized by
   management pursuant to an applicable collective bargaining agreement. Official time for
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                             43


   union-related representational activities will be recorded as required by appropriate
   directives.
   8.7.3. Who is specifically requested to report for an interview in connection with an
   application or referral through the centralized referral system for a position at the same
   activity is not charged leave for the time required for the interview. If the interview is at
   another Air Force activity, within the local commuting area, leave is not charged for the time
   required to make the trip for the interview. This also applies when competition is for a
   position within the Department of Defense.
   8.7.4. When an individual is employed by an activity scheduled for closure or major
   reduction or under notice of separation or change to lower grade for any reason, except
   personal cause, may be excused without charge to leave for any placement interview. Such a
   placement interview may be with another federal agency, a local organization, or a private
   business concern in the commuting area. Except as provided above, absence for placement
   interviews is charged to annual leave, previously-earned compensatory time off, or LWOP.
8.8. Medical Examination for Federal Service. An employee required to take a medical
examination to determine the employee’s fitness for the federal service, or who obtains chest x-
rays or similar medical services administered as part of the health program at the activity, is
considered in duty status during the time necessary to obtain the examination or treatment.
When an employee is absent because of administratively required vaccinations or
immunizations, the absence is considered an excused absence without charge to leave or loss of
pay, provided the medical officer administering the vaccinations or immunizations certifies to
the necessity for the absence.
8.9. Attending Meetings and Conferences:
   8.9.1. Absence, including required travel time, during normal duty hours to attend meetings
   or conferences determined to be training, or absence to attend other meetings for which travel
   is authorized at government expense is considered official duty and no charge is made to
   leave. Note: When spouses, who are also Air Force civilian employees, attend conferences as
   the official escort/guest of a military or civilian official, excused absence is not appropriate
   and leave must be charged.
   8.9.2. Except as provided in paragraphs 8.9.4 and 8.9.5, employees may be excused to attend
   conferences or conventions at no expense to the government when it is determined that such
   attendance is in the best interest of the federal service. An excused absence of this type must
   be limited to those situations where the employee is an official representative of the
   organization involved or an active, scheduled participant in the program, and must be limited
   to 5 work days per calendar year.
   8.9.3. Officers or delegates of an association of management officials or supervisors with
   which an official consultative relationship has been established may be excused to attend
   conventions of the association.
   8.9.4. Guidance concerning the excusal of employees in connection with activities of labor
   organizations, including attendance at their conventions and at training conferences
   sponsored by them, is contained in AFI 36-701, Labor Management Relations.
 44                                               AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


   8.9.5. Employees shall not be excused to attend conferences or conventions of political
   parties or partisan political groups or committees. However, leave may be granted in cases
   where excused absence is not appropriate.
8.10. Holiday Observance:
   8.10.1. Legal Holidays. Employees are not required to work on a legal holiday unless their
   services are required to carry out essential operations. However, unauthorized absence on a
   holiday on which the employee was assigned to work results in loss of holiday premium pay
   for that day, and could result in disciplinary action. The following applies to employees
   receiving annual premium pay under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1) and firefighters covered by the
   Federal Firefighters Overtime Pay Reform Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-277), effective 11 Oct 98.
   The use of excused absence is not appropriate for employees receiving annual premium pay
   under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c)(1) and firefighters covered by the Federal Firefighters Overtime Pay
   Reform Act. These employees who are absent on holidays, which occur within their regular
   tours of duty, must be charged leave for those absences. They are not entitled to holiday time
   off because they receive a type of premium pay that includes pay for holidays. When such an
   employee is scheduled to work on a holiday and the employee is granted the day off for
   personal reasons, the employee is charged annual leave, previously-earned compensatory
   time off, LWOP, sick leave, etc., as appropriate.
   8.10.2. Religious Observance. There are no official observances of religious holidays.
   Insofar as practicable, allow employees wishing to observe religious holidays time off for
   that purpose and charge the absence to annual leave, previously-earned compensatory time
   off, or leave without pay. If circumstances permit, work schedules may be rearranged to
   provide substituted work time. An employee may also request to perform compensatory
   overtime work for the purpose of compensatory time off, in lieu of annual leave when the
   employee’s personal religious beliefs require absence from work during certain periods of the
   workday and/or workweek. An employee may work compensatory time before or after the
   grant of compensatory time off. The advanced compensatory time off should be repaid
   within a reasonable time. An unliquidated advance religious compensatory balance is
   collected at the time of separation, except death, from compensatory balances, if available, or
   annual leave, or both.
   8.10.3. State and Local Holidays. State and local holidays, including local holidays in
   foreign areas, are treated as regular workdays, unless all or part of the activity is closed by
   administrative order because employees are actually prevented from working due to lack of
   transportation services, eating facilities, etc. Employees in activities so closed cannot be
   charged leave for absence on that day. This applies to employees on previously scheduled
   annual or sick leave as well as to those who would have been present for duty had the activity
   remained open. However, employees working on such a day receive only their regular pay
   and are not entitled to holiday premium pay. When the activity remains open, as many
   employees as possible are allowed to take leave on the holiday, depending on the type of
   operation, the workload, and the significance of the holiday.
8.11. Off-the-Job Training During Regularly Scheduled Duty Hours:
   8.11.1. No charge is made to leave for off-the-job training whether conducted on or off the
   installation which is approved under AFI 36-401, Employee Training and Development as
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                             45


   directly related to the employee’s present official duties, or those which the employee could
   reasonably be expected to perform in the future, and which is paid for from Air Force funds.
   8.11.2. No charge is made to leave for off-the-job training whether conducted on or off the
   installation which is approved under AFI 36-401, Employee Training and Development as
   directly related to the employee/veteran’s present official duties or those which the
   employee/veteran could reasonably be expected to perform in the future, when the training is
   approved and paid under 38 U.S.C. 1781, Veterans’ Administration educational assistance
   allowance or when the employee/veteran pays all expenses of such training.
   8.11.3. Training taken by an employee on personal initiative for personal advancement must
   either be taken outside of scheduled duty hours, as credit hours, or during periods of
   approved leave or leave without pay. (See AFI 36-807, Weekly and Daily Scheduling of
   Work and Holiday Observances for variations of work schedules for educational purposes.)
   8.11.4. Mission-related courses approved for Air Force funded tuition assistance will
   normally be taken on a voluntary off-duty basis. Such courses may be taken during duty
   hours subject to approval by the employee’s supervisor.
   8.11.5. Employees who are assigned to an educational institution on long-term training
   (LTT) must report any leave usage (i.e., annual, sick or other leave) to his/her supervisor or
   leave-approving official at their home duty station for accurate recording. Leave requests
   should be submitted to the seminar leader or course instructor and an OPM 71, Request for
   Leave or Approved Absence or other appropriate form, forwarded to the person
   maintaining the employee’s leave record at their home station. Before departing for LTT, an
   employee should make arrangements to use annual leave that may otherwise be lost because
   of training. Due to the nature of the assignment, leave will be approved only during
   Thanksgiving, Christmas and spring breaks; emergency leave is approved throughout the
   LTT, as needed. During extended periods in which the school is in recess (e.g., Christmas
   holidays and spring break), the employee is required to be on leave or returned to a duty
   status at an organization at the training location, the nearest Air Force, Air National Guard or
   Air Force Reserve activity. For Air Force sponsored courses (e.g., PME) taken to enhance
   civilian employment performance, employees may be excused without charge to leave to
   provide time to study, take exams, conduct research, etc.
8.12. Military Funerals:
   8.12.1. An Air Force civilian employee who is a veteran of the armed forces and who
   participates as a pallbearer, a member of a firing squad, or a member of an honor guard in
   funerals for members of the armed forces who lost their lives on active duty is excused from
   duty without charge to leave, but not in excess of 4 hours in 1 day. An employee is excused
   for not more than 3 days to make arrangements for or to attend the funeral or memorial
   service of an immediate relative who died as the result of wounds, disease, or injury incurred
   while serving in the armed forces in a combat zone.

Section 8B—Absences Relating to Travel

8.13. Absences in Connection with Travel.
   8.13.1. Permanent Duty Travel. An employee with permanent change of duty station (PCS)
   orders may be granted excused absence to make personal arrangements and transact personal
46                                               AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


  business directly related to the permanent change in duty station, provided that such business
  or arrangements cannot be transacted outside regular working hours. This includes such
  things as closing and opening personal bank accounts, or obtaining a driver’s license and
  auto tags. This provision does not cover time involved in complying with PCS requirements
  such as obtaining passport and vaccinations, adhering to government housing authority
  requirements, or being present for packing and receiving of household goods. Such tasks
  required by the PCS are considered to be official duties. For an assignment to or return from,
  overseas employment, official duties further include time spent to deliver or reclaim privately
  owned vehicle (POV) to or from the port facility, obtain required physical examination,
  vaccination and inoculation, or passport, or to comply with other special requirements
  imposed because of the overseas assignment, including absence to obtain travel orders. An
  employee required to report to another activity to comply with overseas processing
  requirements is not charged leave for any absence necessary to make the trip. Excused
  absence or official duty time only applies to the employee for whom PCS orders has been
  authorized and not to any civilian employees who may be listed on the orders as dependents.
  8.13.2. When extensive permanent change of duty travel outside of regularly scheduled
  hours of duty is required, employees are authorized to be absent from work without charge to
  leave or loss of pay for a reasonable time to recuperate from fatigue or loss of sleep. In
  determining “reasonable time” the supervisor considers the adverse effect on work
  performance, health, or well-being, and any safety hazard which might result from working
  while fatigued. Normally, this should not exceed 4 hours. When the total elapsed travel time
  exceeds 20 consecutive hours, as in the case of travel between the continental United States
  and either Pacific or European bases, up to 8 hours of duty time may be excused for
  recuperation.
  8.13.3. Privately Owned Conveyance. When a privately owned conveyance is authorized or
  approved for permanent duty travel, except for renewal agreement travel, travel time for
  salary payment purposes is computed on the basis of 350 miles a calendar day. Any time in
  excess of the computed number of days which falls within the employee’s regularly
  scheduled basic workweek is charged to leave. No charge is made to leave if an employee
  arrives at the new duty station before the reporting date, computed on the basis of 350 miles
  of travel a calendar day.
  8.13.4. Temporary Duty/Travel. Duty time or excused absence for temporary duty (TDY)
  and related travel is authorized when the temporary duty is for official duties only. Any other
  TDY not part of the employee’s official duties must be charged to leave. When privately
  owned conveyance is authorized or approved as being advantageous to the government for
  temporary duty travel, the employee is considered in travel status, without charge to leave,
  during the actual time required for official travel. In computing the actual time required, any
  excess time required because of a delay enroute or circuitous routing specifically determined
  to be for the employee’s convenience is deducted from the total elapsed time and the
  employee is required to take leave.
     8.13.4.1. When an employee is allowed to use the employee’s privately owned
     conveyance for the employee’s own convenience on temporary duty travel, the employee
     is considered in travel status for the scheduled travel time by common carrier or usual
     mode of transportation that otherwise would be required. Any time in excess of this
     period which falls within the employee’s scheduled basic workweek is charged to leave.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                             47


       8.13.4.2. When an employee begins or ends temporary duty travel by commercial carrier
       during regularly scheduled hours of duty, supervisors may excuse the employee for up to
       3 hours without charge to leave.
       8.13.4.3. When extensive temporary duty travel outside of regularly scheduled hours of
       duty is required, employees are authorized to be absent from work without charge to
       leave or loss of pay for a reasonable time to recuperate from fatigue or loss of sleep. This
       provision does not apply to employees who are performing work while traveling and
       being compensated by compensatory time off, paid overtime, or credit hours, e.g., ART
       aircrew members. In determining “reasonable time” the supervisor considers the adverse
       effect on work performance, health, or well being, and any safety hazard which might
       result from working while fatigued. Normally, this should not exceed 4 hours. When the
       total elapsed travel time exceeds 20 consecutive hours, as in the case of travel between
       the continental United States and either Pacific or European bases, up to 8 hours of duty
       time may be excused for recuperation
8.14. Absences Resulting From Hostile Action Abroad. A civilian employee who is injured
as the result of war, insurgency, mob violence, or similar action while serving in the CONUS or
serving abroad is not charged leave for absence up to 1 year resulting from the injury. The injury
must not have been the result of vicious habit, intemperance, or willful misconduct of the
employee.

                     VOLUNTARY LEAVE TRANSFER PROGRAM

9.1. Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of this chapter is to set forth procedures and
requirements for the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program. This program allows an employee who
has a medical emergency and is without the availability of paid leave, to receive transferred
annual leave directly from other employees with the concurrence of the respective management
officials. This chapter applies to all employees covered by 5 U.S.C. 6301(2) and 5 CFR 630.906.
9.2. Administrative Procedures. The appointing official or designee should establish
appropriate supplemental procedures to approve or disapprove the receipt of transferred annual
leave for the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program at the installation level.
9.3. Application To Be A Leave Recipient. An employee who has been affected by a medical
emergency may make written application to his/her first level supervisor or leave approving
official to become a leave recipient. If such an employee is not capable of making application,
due to physical or mental impairment, the leave applicant or immediate family member may
designate a personal representative in writing to make the application.
   9.3.1. Application Requirements. Each application must include the following:
       9.3.1.1. The name, position title, pay plan, grade/step, hourly/annual rate of pay of the
       applicant, specific organization, and office symbol of employment.
       9.3.1.2. Social security number.
       9.3.1.3. Annual and sick leave balance as of the date of application. (Applicant should
       attach a copy of the latest leave and earnings statement to reflect current leave balances.)
       9.3.1.4. Expected date on which available paid leave will run out.
       9.3.1.5. Accrual rate for annual leave.
       9.3.1.6. Expected duration of the hardship.
       9.3.1.7. Description of the hardship (include health care provider certification and/or any
       attachments that may be used as evidence that will assist the approving official in making
       a decision). Medical evidence must be provided by the employee/applicant and is
       necessary for the employee to become a leave recipient. The employee must consent in
       writing to the release of this information to officials involved in the review process.
       9.3.1.8. The applicants must agree to the use of their names and approve the public
       release of the existence of a hardship for any publicized efforts to collect donated leave.
       If the employee chooses anonymity, he/she should be advised that anonymity would
       likely result in minimal leave donations. (NOTE: OPM 630, Application to Become A
       Leave Recipient Under the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program, has a block for the
       employee to check for anonymity. Anonymity should not preclude the Air Force from
       receiving donations for the leave recipient as in the case of donations from relatives and
       close friends.)
       9.3.1.9. Telephone number during the period of hardship.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                              49


       9.3.1.10. Name, address, and telephone number of the person to contact on behalf of the
       applicant, if applicable.
   9.3.2. The completed application will be forwarded to the first level supervisor for
   verification of the employment data and endorsed to the approving official.
9.4. Approval of the Application to Become a Leave Recipient. Upon receipt of an
application to receive transferred annual leave, the first level supervisor will verify and validate
the employment information contained in the application. The application must be returned to the
applicant if correction or additional information is required. The supervisor must determine that
the employee’s absence from duty without available paid leave because of the medical
emergency is or is expected to be at least 24 hours and is likely to result in a substantial loss of
income to the employee because of the unavailability of paid leave. Note: In the case of a part-
time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, at least 30% of the average
number of hours in the employee’s bi-weekly scheduled tour of duty will be the determining
factor. Once the application receives supervisory endorsement, it is forwarded to the approving
official within 5 workdays from the date of receipt of the application. The supervisor will
provide informal notice to the CPF that the employee has filed an application to receive
transferred annual leave. The supervisory endorsement will include the following:
   9.4.1. A statement acknowledging and verifying as correct, the employment information
   contained in the application.
   9.4.2. An acknowledgment that if approved, the supervisor will validate the continuing
   nature of the hardship each pay period and upon termination of the hardship, stop the
   allocation of transferred leave.
   9.4.3. An acknowledgment that if approved, the supervisor is responsible to properly
   annotate time and attendance records to insure that all available paid leave is exhausted
   before any transferred annual leave is used by the applicant. The supervisor must work
   closely with the civilian payroll office to monitor the use of transferred leave.
   9.4.4. A recommendation to the approving official indicating approval or disapproval of the
   employee’s absence from the workplace.
   9.4.5. A recommendation for the approval or disapproval of the application based on the
   hardship as described by the applicant.
9.5. Approving Official’s Responsibilities. The approving official or designee will complete
the following applicable actions within 10 calendar days after receipt of the application from the
supervisor.
   9.5.1. If the application is disapproved, provide direct written notice to the applicant that the
   application has been disapproved and the reasons for disapproval. Copies of the disapproval
   will be furnished to the first level supervisor.
   9.5.2. A copy of the approved application will be provided to the applicant with copies to the
   first level supervisor, the civilian payroll office, and the servicing CPF. For approved leave
   recipients who have agreed to the release of their names, instruct the first level supervisor to
   arrange appropriate publicity to employees of the recipient’s organization of assignment to
   canvass the desire to transfer annual leave to the recipient. Publicity efforts must be
   consistent for all employees who have approval to receive transferred annual leave. If
 50                                                AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


   insufficient donations are received to cover the period without pay, the supervisor with
   assistance from the CPF may expand the publicity effort to other offices within the leave
   recipient’s organization of assignment. If the donations remain insufficient, the supervisor in
   cooperation with the CPF, may expand publicity in the following order:
       9.5.2.1. Other organizations on the installation.
       9.5.2.2. Parent MAJCOM of applicant.
       9.5.2.3. Other AF installations.
       9.5.2.4. Other federal agencies.
9.6. Transfer of Annual Leave. A leave recipient’s employing organization may accept the
transfer of annual leave from leave donors employed by the same organization and, if necessary,
the transfer of approved donations by employees of other organizations. Every effort should be
made to exhaust all available donated leave within the leave recipient’s organization of
assignment before using approved transferred annual leave from other organizations. The
OPM 630, 630-A, 630-B, and 630-C are available on the OPM web site (http://www.opm.gov)
for transfer and receipt of annual leave in the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program.
   9.6.1. A first level supervisor is prohibited from receiving donated leave from a subordinate
   employee.
   9.6.2. An employee may submit to his/her first level supervisor or leave approving official a
   voluntary, irrevocable request on the OPM 630-A or the OPM 630-B to transfer a specific
   number of whole hours of accrued annual leave to the leave account of a specified approved
   leave recipient as follows:
       9.6.2.1. Name, position title, pay plan, grade/step, hourly/annual rate of pay and specific
       organization and office symbol of employment.
       9.6.2.2. Social security number.
       9.6.2.3. Annual leave balance as of the date of the request to donate leave.
       9.6.2.4. Accrual rate for annual leave.
       9.6.2.5. Number of hours to be earned during the remainder of the leave year.
       9.6.2.6. Number of hours designated as “use or lose”.
       9.6.2.7. An acknowledgment that the request to donate leave is fully voluntary without
       personal reservations, coercion, or intimidation.
       9.6.2.8. An acknowledgment that the donation of annual leave is irrevocable.
       9.6.2.9. An acknowledgment that the donor expects nothing in return, to include receipt
       of transferred annual leave.
       9.6.2.10. An acknowledgment that unused transferred annual leave will be returned on a
       pro-rata basis determined by the approving authority (see paragraph 9.10).
       9.6.2.11. The name and employing activity of the approved leave recipient, designated to
       receive the donation.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                            51


   9.6.3. Approval of the Donation. The leave-approving official of the donor may forward the
   documented, approved donation to the servicing CPF of the leave recipient. The documented
   donation will be quality reviewed, validated by the CPF, and forwarded to the servicing
   civilian payroll office.
   9.6.4. Substitution of Transferred Annual Leave. Annual leave transferred under this
   authority may be substituted retroactively for absence without pay or used to liquidate an
   indebtedness for advanced annual or sick leave as a result of an approved medical
   emergency. (Note: The current pay system will not replace LWOP coding. If an
   employee’s time and attendance sheet is marked as LWOP, transferred leave cannot
   “automatically” replace that period of unpaid absence until it is deleted. For this reason, the
   civilian payroll office recommends that even when an employee has no sick leave or annual
   leave balance, the time sheet should be marked either SL (for personal illness) or AL (for
   family member’s illness) to prevent the need to have corrected time sheets.)
9.7. Limitations on Donations of Annual Leave. A potential leave donor must have a
sufficient number of hours of accrued annual leave in order to donate leave. Donating leave
earned in future pay periods is prohibited.
   9.7.1. The maximum donation of leave is no more than a total of one-half of the amount of
   annual leave an employee would be entitled to accrue during the leave year in which the
   donation is made (Example: An employee who earns 104 hours of annual leave may donate
   a maximum of 52 hours.) The limitation on donating annual leave may be waived, in
   writing, by the installation commander or their designee, provided the employee has
   extenuating circumstances and it has been documented as such.
   9.7.2. A leave donor who is projected to have annual leave that otherwise would be subject
   to forfeiture at the end of the leave year under 5 U.S.C 6304(a) may donate no more than the
   number of hours remaining in the leave year (as of the date of transfer) for which the leave
   donor is scheduled to work and receive pay. (Example: If two weeks before the end of the
   leave year, a leave donor has 100 hours of use or lose leave and is scheduled to work for only
   60 hours, up to 60 hours may be donated.) The limitation on donating annual leave subject to
   forfeiture may be waived, in writing, by the installation commander or their designee,
   provided the employee has extenuating circumstances and it has been documented as such.
   See 5 CFR 630.908(b) and (c).
9.8. Use of Transferred Annual Leave. An employee in a shared leave status using transferred
leave under the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program may use the donated leave only for the
purpose of the medical emergency for which the recipient was approved. A separate account is
established for accruals earned on donated leave. Employees are allowed to accumulate up to 40
hours of annual and sick leave while using transferred annual leave. (See 5 CFR 630.907(a)(1)
and (2)).
   9.8.1. The approval and use of transferred annual leave by an approved leave recipient shall
   be subject to all the conditions and requirements imposed by 5 U.S.C. Chapter 63. Upon
   approval, transferred annual leave received by an approved leave recipient may be
   accumulated without regard to the limitation imposed by (normally, 30 days or 240 hours) 5
   U.S.C. 6304(a). The leave recipient’s servicing civilian payroll office must monitor the
   transfer of donated leave. The balance of the transferred leave will be posted to the leave
   recipient’s account the following leave year, if necessary.

   9.8.2. Transferred annual leave may not be used as follows:
      9.8.2.1. Transferred to another leave recipient under this regulatory authority.
      9.8.2.2. Transferred to another employing activity upon the leave recipient’s transfer of
      employment.
      9.8.2.3. Included in a lump-sum payment under 5 U.S.C. 5551 or 5552.
      9.8.2.4. Made available for recredit under 5 U.S.C. 6306 upon reemployment by a
      federal agency.
9.9. Termination of Medical Emergency.
   9.9.1. Based on medical documentation or other appropriate action, the entitlement to
   receive transferred leave shall terminate as follows:
      9.9.1.1. When the leave recipient’s employment is terminated by the same agency which
      approved the application to become a leave recipient.
      9.9.1.2. At the end of the bi-weekly pay period in which the leave recipient’s approving
      official or designee determines that the leave recipient is no longer affected by a medical
      emergency.
      9.9.1.3. At the end of the bi-weekly pay period in which the leave recipient’s employing
      activity receives notice from the OPM of an approved application for disability
      retirement.
   9.9.2. The leave recipient’s first level supervisor or leave approving official shall continually
   monitor (each pay period) the nature and extent of medical emergency affecting the leave
   recipient. Senior management officials must develop and maintain internal procedures to
   insure supervisory biweekly review of the medical emergency.
   9.9.3. When it is determined that the medical emergency or hardship affecting the leave
   recipient has terminated (based on medical evidence), and the leave recipient has had the
   opportunity to respond, the following actions are required: (See 5 CFR 630.910(a)(3).)
      9.9.3.1. No further donations will be accepted.
      9.9.3.2. No further transfers of annual leave will occur.
      9.9.3.3. The supervisor or leave approving official will provide written notice to the
      Voluntary Leave Transfer Program approving official and the civilian payroll office with
      a copy to the leave recipient as follows:
          9.9.3.3.1. Include the name, employee’s social security number, and organization of
          assignment of the leave recipient.
          9.9.3.3.2. Approval date of the leave recipient’s application.
          9.9.3.3.3. Initial date of receipt of transferred annual leave and the date the
          emergency ended as determined by the appropriate official.
          9.9.3.3.4. Total number of transferred annual leave hours used, total number of
          transferred hours donated, and unused transferred leave remaining.
          9.9.3.3.5. Date the leave recipient returned to work or separated from employment.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                            53


           9.9.3.3.6. A statement that unused transferred leave will not be used to compute lump
           sum leave payment upon separation.
9.10. Restoration of Transferred Annual Leave.
   9.10.1. Restoration of unused transferred annual leave is computed by the civilian payroll
   office. Upon receipt of the supervisory notice indicating the termination of the leave
   recipient’s emergency or hardship, the servicing civilian payroll office will compute
   appropriate restoration of transferred annual leave as follows:
       9.10.1.1. Divide the number of hours of unused transferred leave by the total number of
       hours of annual leave transferred to the leave recipient.
       9.10.1.2. Multiply the ratio obtained in paragraph 9.10.1.1, by the number of hours of
       annual leave transferred by each leave donor eligible to receive restoration of unused
       transferred annual leave. The leave shall be restored to the annual leave accounts of the
       leave donors who, on the date leave restoration is made, are employed by a federal
       agency and subject to Chapter 63 of 5 U.S.C. (See 5 CFR 630.911(a)). The civilian
       payroll office will receive assistance from the CPF which will validate the donor’s
       eligibility to receive unused transferred annual leave.
       9.10.1.3. Round down the result obtained in paragraph 9.10.1.2, to the nearest increment
       of whole hours of annual leave.
   9.10.2. If the total number of eligible leave donors exceeds the total number of hours of
   annual leave to be restored, no unused transferred annual leave shall be restored. In no case
   shall the amount of annual leave restored to the leave donor exceed the amount transferred to
   the leave recipient by the leave donor.
   9.10.3. Transferred annual leave restored to the account of a leave donor before the
   beginning of the third bi-weekly pay period before the end of the leave year is subject to the
   limitation imposed by 5 U.S.C 6304(a).
   9.10.4. Transferred annual leave restored to the account of a leave donor after the beginning
   of the third bi-weekly pay period before the end of the leave year shall not be subject to the
   limitations imposed by 5 U.S.C. 6304(a) until the end of the leave year following the leave
   year in which the transferred annual leave was restored.
9.11. Prohibition of Coercion. An individual may not directly or indirectly intimidate,
threaten, or coerce any other individual for the purpose of interfering with any right an employee
may have to donate, not to donate, receive, or use annual leave under this chapter.
   9.11.1. Adequate publicity will be provided by management officials when an application to
   receive transferred annual leave is approved. Therefore, the leave recipient is discouraged
   from expressing any personal solicitations to procure transferred annual leave from other
   employees.
   9.11.2. For the purposes of this chapter the term “intimidate, threaten, or coerce” includes a
   prohibition of promise to confer any benefit associated with employment (such as
   appointment, promotion, compensation, hours of work, or assignment of duties). Effecting
   or threatening reprisal for not donating leave or donating leave to a specific employee is
   strictly forbidden.

9.12. Emergency Leave Transfer Program. Authorized by Section 6391 of title 5 U.S.C. (as
added by section 9004 of P.L. 105-18, Leave Transfer in Disasters and Emergencies, dated June
12, 1997), Air Force employees are allowed to make leave donations of annual leave to
employees in their own agencies or other agencies who are affected by major disasters and other
emergencies. Employees affected by major disasters may also be able to use leave donated under
the Voluntary Leave Transfer Program. This also allows employees receiving such donated leave
to use it before exhausting their own accumulated annual and sick leave. OPM 1637,
Application to Become a Leave Recipient Under the Emergency Leave Transfer Program
and OPM 1638, Request to Donate Annual Leave under the Emergency Leave Transfer
Program, may be used for receiving donated annual leave or donating annual leave under this
program. (See 5 U.S.C. 6391.) OPM 1639, Transfer of Donated Annual Leave To or From
the Emergency Leave Transfer Program must be used for the purpose of donating or receiving
annual leave from other agencies.

                                          Chapter 10

                             FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE

10.1. Purpose. This chapter implements the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA)
and 5 CFR Part 630, Subpart L, Family and Medical Leave. It entitles Federal employees to a
total of 12 administrative workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for certain
family and medical needs as specified in 5 CFR 630.1203(a).
10.2. Coverage. This chapter applies to employees covered by 5 U.S.C. 6381(1).
10.3. Leave Entitlement. A covered employee is entitled to a total of 12 administrative
workweeks of unpaid leave (leave without pay) during any 12-month period for:
   10.3.1. The birth of a son or daughter and care of the newborn.
   10.3.2. The placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care.
   10.3.3. The care of a spouse, son, daughter, or parent of the employee with a serious health
   condition.
   10.3.4. A serious health condition, as defined in 5 CFR 630.1202, of the employee that
   makes the employee unable to perform duties of his or her position. NOTE: An employee
   may elect to substitute paid leave IAW paragraph 10.9. An employee must provide written
   medical certification of a serious health condition, signed by the health care provider no later
   than 15 calendar days after the date requested by the Air Force. Form WH-380, Certification
   of Health Care Provider, from the U.S. Department of Labor, may be used by employees to
   satisfy this mandatory requirement to furnish a medical certification from a health care
   provider, including second or third opinions and recertification (See 29 CFR 825.306). This
   form       is      available       for     use       on      the      OPM         web       site
   (http://www.opm.gov).
10.4. Requirement to Invoke FMLA. An employee must invoke his or her entitlement to
family or medical leave subject to proper notification and medical certification requirements in
5 CFR 630.1206 and 5 CFR 630.1207. Request for FMLA must be supported by evidence that is
administratively acceptable to the Air Force. If an employee does not comply with the request for
sufficient medical certification, the employee is not entitled to leave under FMLA. However, if
the employee is unable to provide the requested medical certification before leave begins, or if
there is a question about the validity of the original certification provided by the employee and
the medical treatment requires the leave to begin, provisional leave will be granted pending final
written medical certification. Barring emergency situations not known in advance, an employee
must provide the employing agency 30-days advance notice of intent of the need for FMLA and
may not retroactively invoke his or her entitlement to FMLA. However, if an employee and
his/her personal representative are physically or mentally incapable of invoking the employee’s
entitlement to FMLA leave during the entire period in which the employee is absent from work,
the employee may retroactively invoke his/her entitlement to FMLA leave within two workdays
after returning to work. (See 5 CFR 630.1203(b)). An employee may take up to 12 administrative
work weeks of family and medical leave necessary for the circumstances that prompted the need
for FMLA. This leave may be taken intermittently. If an employee who is in a LWOP status
(even to accompany a military spouse or civilian sponsor) invokes FMLA, the employee still has
 56                                               AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010


the entitlement to FMLA. Since the agency allowed the employee to go on LWOP instead of
separating the employee, the employee is still on the roles of the agency and has the entitlement
to FMLA.
10.5. Effective Date of FMLA. The 12-month period referred to in paragraph 10.3 begins on
the date an employee first takes leave for a family or medical need and continues for 12 months.
An employee is not entitled to 12 additional workweeks of leave until the previous 12-month
period ends and an event occurs that entitles the employee to another period of family or medical
leave. (This may include a continuation of a previous situation.)
10.6. Covered Employees. FMLA is available to full-time and part-time employees. An
employee must have completed 12 months of service (not required to be recent or consecutive if
applying for FMLA under 5 CFR 630.1201(b)(ii)). A total of 12 administrative workweeks will
be made available equally for full-time or part-time employees in direct proportion to the number
of hours in the employee’s regularly scheduled administrative workweek. The 12 administrative
workweeks of leave will be calculated on an hourly basis and will equal 12 times the average
number of hours in the employee’s regularly scheduled administrative workweek. If the number
of hours in an employee’s workweek varies from week to week, a weekly average of the hours
scheduled over the 12 weeks prior to the date leave begins will be used as the basis for the
calculation.
10.7. Protection of Employment and Benefits. Upon return from FMLA leave, the employee
must be returned to the same position held when the leave began or an equivalent position with
equivalent benefits, pay, status, and other terms and conditions of employment. An equivalent
position must be in the same commuting area and must have the same or substantially similar
duties and responsibilities of the position held when the leave began.
10.8. Health Benefits. While on FMLA leave, the employee is entitled to maintain health
benefits coverage under the FEHB Program. If the employee is on leave without pay under the
FMLA, the employee is responsible for paying the employee share of the health benefits
premium.
10.9. Substitution of Paid Leave. An employee may choose to substitute annual leave for
unpaid leave under the FMLA. Substitution of paid leave for FMLA cannot be done
retroactively. An employee may also substitute sick leave in those situations in which the use of
sick leave is permitted and made in advance. (See 5 CFR 630.1205(3).) Advanced annual or
sick leave and/or leave made available to an employee under the Voluntary Leave Transfer
Program may also be available.
10.10. Expanded Family and Medical Leave Policies. Employees may schedule and take up
to 24 hours of leave without pay each leave year for participation in school activities, routine
family medical appointments, and elderly relatives’ health needs.
AFI36-815_AFISRASUP_I 13 APRIL 2010                                                               57


                                            Chapter 11

                 LEAVE FOR BONE-MARROW OR ORGAN DONATION

11.1. Absence to Serve as a Bone-Marrow, Stem Cell or Organ Donor. An employee is
entitled to use 7 days of paid leave each calendar year (in addition to annual or sick leave) to
serve as a bone-marrow or stem cell donor. An employee may use up to 30 days of paid leave as
an organ donor. Bone-marrow or organ donor leave may be used, but is not limited to, such
situations as blood testing, tissue testing, counseling, physical examinations, travel time, surgery,
and recuperation. Employees who are screened, but not accepted as donors, are entitled to bone-
marrow, stem cell, or organ donor leave for their absences in conjunction with their attempt to be
donors. Medical procedures and recuperation depend on the circumstance of each case. Record
this type of leave on the time and attendance documentation under administrative or other leave
category. (See 5 U.S.C. 6327.)
11.2. Absence of Employee Having Bone-Marrow Removed. An individual having bone-
marrow removed and stored for future use is not a “donor,” and the benefit of 7 days of paid time
off was not intended for someone who is undergoing such a procedure for his or her own needs.
Sick leave, annual leave, and advanced annual and sick leave are available to an employee facing
this type of medical procedure. In addition, leave donated under the Voluntary Leave Transfer
Program and LWOP under the FMLA may be used if the condition meets the requirements of
these programs.

                                          Chapter 12

                                        HOME LEAVE

12.1. Home Leave Entitlement. Home leave is authorized after an employee has completed 24
months of continuous service abroad. Service abroad means service on and after 6 September
1960, by an employee at a post of duty outside the United States and outside the employee’s
place of residence if his place of residence is in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or a territory
or possession of the United States. Home leave is earned at a rate of 5, 10, or 15 days based on
the number of months of service abroad and criteria in 5 CFR 630.604. (See 5 CFR 630.605(a)
for Home Leave-Earning Table.)
12.2. Subsequent Service Abroad. In accordance with 5 CFR 630.606(c)(2) and DoD
1400.25-M, DoD Civilian Personnel Manuel, Subchapter 1260, Home Leave, home leave may
be granted only when an employee has completed 24 months of continuous service abroad.
Home leave not granted during an employee’s period of service abroad, or within a reasonable
period after returning from service abroad when it is contemplated that the employee will return
to service abroad immediately or on completion of an assignment in the United States, may be
granted only when the employee has completed a further substantial period of service abroad.
This further substantial period of service abroad may not be less than the tour of duty prescribed
for the employee’s post of assignment, except when the responsible Major Command/DPC, or
designee, determines that an earlier and shorter grant of home leave is warranted on a case-by-
case basis.
12.3. Refund for Home Leave. An employee is indebted for the home leave used by him/her
when he/she fails to return to service abroad after the period of home leave, or after the
completion of an assignment in the United States. However, a refund for this indebtedness is not
required when (1) the employee has completed not less than 6 months’ service in an assignment
in the United States following the period of home leave; (2) the agency determines that the
employee’s failure to return was due to compelling personal reasons of a humanitarian or
compassionate nature, such as may involve physical or mental health or circumstances over
which the employee has no control; or (3) the agency which granted the home leave determines
that it is in the public interest not to return the employee to his overseas assignment.

Publication; and AF Form 971, Supervisor’s Employee Brief.

Terms
Absence Without Leave (AWOL).—An absence from duty which was not authorized or for
which leave has been denied. Neither the denial of leave nor the time and attendance reporting
of AWOL is punitive, and neither means that the employee has insufficient reason for requesting
leave. Note: Rather, it means that the employee’s presence is required and that the reason for
requesting it is not one for which leave must be approved. The employee’s failure to honor the
leave denial and the unauthorized absence may form the basis for disciplinary or adverse action.
Accrued Leave.—Leave earned by an employee during the current leave year that is unused at
any given time in that leave year.
Accumulated Leave.—Unused leave remaining to the credit of an employee at the beginning of
a leave year.
Administrative Workweek.—A period of 7 consecutive 24-hour periods designated in advance
by the head of an agency under 5 U.S.C. 6101.
Agency.—Agency is defined as the Air Force.
Adoption.—A legal process in which an individual becomes the legal parent of another’s child.
Approving Official.—The individual or designated representative who acts as the approving/
disapproving official for civilian absence and leave programs, e.g., for receipt of transferred
annual leave.
Armed Forces.—The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.

Available Paid Leave.—Accrued or accumulated annual or sick leave and recredited and
restored annual or sick leave. Available paid leave does not include annual or sick leave
advanced to an employee or any annual leave transferred and accrued under the Voluntary Leave
Transfer Program provisions.
Contagious Disease.—A disease that is ruled as subject to quarantine, requires isolation of the
patient, or requires restriction of movement by the patient for a specified period, as prescribed by
health authorities having jurisdiction. Examples of contagious diseases that meet this definition
include employees who have been exposed to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or
the strain of tuberculosis that is highly resistant to antibiotics.
Employee.—An individual who meets the definition under 5 U.S.C. 6301(2).
Essential Functions.—The fundamental job duties of an employee’s position. An employee
who must be absent from work to receive medical treatment for a serious health condition is
considered unable to perform the essential functions of the position during the absence for
treatment.
Family and Medical Leave.—An employee’s entitlement to 12 administrative workweeks of
unpaid leave for certain family and medical needs.
Family Member.—The following relatives of the employee: Spouse, and parents thereof;
children, including adopted children and spouses thereof; parents; brothers and sisters, and
spouses thereof; and any individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the
employee is the equivalent of a family relationship. The definition of a family member under the
FMLA is more restrictive. Under FMLA, the definition of a family member is spouse, son,
daughter, or parent. For more information on FMLA, see Chapter 10.
Foster Care.—24-hour care for children in substitution for, and away from, their parents or
guardian. Such placement is made by or with the agreement of the State as a result of a
voluntary agreement by the parent or guardian that the child be removed from the home, or
pursuant to a judicial determination of the necessity for foster care, and involves agreement
between the State and foster family to take the child. Although foster care may be with relatives
of the child, State action is involved in the removal of the child from parental custody.
Funeral Leave.—Leave authorized in connection with funerals of immediate relatives in the
Armed Forces.
Health Care Provider.—Any physician who is board-certified in a medical specialty, or a
physician serving on active duty in the uniformed services who is board-eligible and who is
designated by the uniformed service to perform examinations. Also includes other appropriate
practitioners such as: physician assistants, chiropractors, psychologists, nurse practitioners,
licensed occupational and physical therapists, dieticians, Christian Science practitioners, Native
Americans who practice traditional healing methods, etc.
Immediate Relative or Immediate Family.—The following relatives of a deceased member of
the Armed Forces: Spouse, and parents thereof; children, including adopted children, and
spouses thereof; parents; brothers and sisters, and spouses thereof; and any individual related by
blood or affinity whose close association with the deceased was such as to have been the
equivalent of a family relationship.

organization of assignment.
Leave Recipient.—A current employee for whom the employing agency has approved an
application to receive annual leave from the annual leave accounts of one or more leave donors.
Leave Without Pay (LWOP).—An absence from duty in a nonpay status. Leave without pay
may be taken only for those hours of duty comprising an employee’s basic workweek. A
temporary status and absence from duty granted upon the employee’s request. Except where
specifically authorized by law or this instruction as a matter of right, granting of leave without
pay is a matter of administrative discretion. The fact that it is a scheduled absence requiring
approval distinguishes it from absence without leave, which is an absence without permission
that may serve as the basis for disciplinary action.
Leave Year.—The period beginning with the first day of the first complete pay period in a
calendar year and ending with the day immediately before the first day of the first complete pay
period in the following calendar year.
Medical Certificate.—A written statement signed by a registered practicing physician or other

disability while the patient was receiving professional treatment.
Medical Documentation.—“Medical documentation” or “documentation of medical condition”
is a written statement signed by a licensed physician or health care provider which provides the
following information, or the parts identified by the activity as necessary and relevant: (1) The
history of the medical conditions, including references to findings from previous examinations,
treatment, and responses to treatment. (2) Clinical findings from the most recent medical
evaluation, including any of the following which have been obtained: Findings of physical
examination; results of laboratory tests; X -rays; EKGs and other special evaluations or
diagnostic procedures; and, in the case of psychiatric evaluation of psychological assessment, the
findings of a mental status examination and the results of psychological tests, if appropriate.
(3) Diagnosis, including the current clinical status. (4) Prognosis, including plans for future
treatment and an estimate of the expected date of full or partial recovery. (5) An explanation of
the impact of the medical condition on overall health and activities, including the basis for any
conclusion that restrictions or accommodations are or are not warranted, and where they are
warranted, an explanation of their therapeutic or risk avoiding value. (6) An explanation of the
medical basis for any conclusion which indicates the likelihood that the individual is or is not
expected to suffer sudden or subtle incapacitation by carrying out, with or without
accommodation, the tasks or duties of a specific position. (7) Narrative explanation of the
medical basis for any conclusion that the medical condition has or has not become static or well
stabilized and the likelihood that the individual may experience sudden or subtle incapacitation
as a result of the medical condition. In this context, “static or well-stabilized medical condition”
means a medical condition which is not likely to change as a consequence of the natural
progression of the condition, specifically as a result of the normal aging process, or in response
to the work environment or the work itself. “Subtle incapacitation” means gradual, initially
imperceptible impairment of physical or mental function whether reversible or not which is

Medical Documentation Review.—Means assessment of medical documentation by, or in
coordination with, a health care provider to ensure that the following criteria are met: (1) The
diagnosis or clinical impression is justified according to established diagnostic criteria. (2) The
conclusions and recommendations are not inconsistent with generally accepted medical
principles and practice. If the health care provider believes the “permanent” medical condition
and attending restrictions pose a significant risk to the employee’s health and safety, the health
care provider should indicate this in the medical documentation.
Medical Emergency.—A medical condition of an employee or a family member of an employee
that is likely to require an employee’s absence from duty for a prolonged period of time and
would result in a substantial loss of income to the employee because of the unavailability of paid
leave.
Paid Leave Status.—The administrative status of an employee while the employee is using
accrued or accumulated annual or sick leave.

                                Attachment 2 (Added-AFISRA)
          REQUEST TO PARTICIPATE IN PHYSICAL FITNESS ACTIVITIES


I,                                            , request approval for up to three (3) hours of
excused absence per workweek to participate in physical fitness activities (PFA).
I propose the following schedule:
I understand (employee must initial each line):
_____ The sole purpose of this time is to improve my physical fitness. I may not use this
excused absence for any other purpose than to participate in PFA. If I abuse this privilege, it will
be revoked and I may be subject to disciplinary action.
_____ Participation is strictly voluntary and subject to supervisor scheduling and approval. I
must coordinate each occurrence to participate in PFA with my supervisor. If my supervisor
disapproves my request to participate in PFA due to mission requirements, I may not challenge
the decision unless the decision appears arbitrary or capricious.
_____ I may only utilize on-base or tenant agency fitness facilities during any period of excused
absence for PFA.
_____ Absences are scheduled in 15 minute increments, but may not exceed 90 minutes on one
workday. I may not accumulate unused time for use in a later workweek(s). Time allowed to
participate in PFA includes travel time (to and/or from on-base facilities), and preparation time
before and after the workout.
_____ I must record each time I participate in PFA on my time sheet with the code, LN (for
excused absence) along with the remark, “Physical Fitness”.
_____ A physician’s statement must accompany this request (obtained at employee’s expense)
that permits PFA, with or without limitations.
_____ I must immediately notify my supervisor should my ability to participate in PFA become
limited in any manner and suspend participation, if warranted.
