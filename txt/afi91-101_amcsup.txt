2.15. Wing/Base Level Weapon Safety Managers. The NSM is the commander's personal
representative and the single point of contact regarding nuclear surety matters. The NSM is a
coordinator and advisor to the commander and staff on nuclear surety matters. The NSM's
primary responsibility of mishap prevention demands active and aggressive involvement in the
daily operation of the unit. The NSM must identify programmatic, procedural or equipment
problems to the responsible functional manager for resolution and assist with corrective actions,
as appropriate. If a problem is significant or resolution does not appear to be timely and
effective, inform the commander. The NSM at a PNAF wing is assigned to a funded position
earned by application of the Air Force Manpower Standard (AFMS) for weapons safety and
associated variance for nuclear surety. Changing the category (example: civilian, enlisted,
officer) of a funded authorization is a wing option. NOTE: The NSM (Active Duty or civilian)
will have nuclear surety experience and be knowledgeable in PNAF operations.
2.15.1.1. (Added) The NSM may inspect all functions in one effort or space the inspections
throughout a 12-month period. If the NSM inspects all functions in one effort, the inspection
will not be completed during the 90-day period following the MAJCOM NSI.
2.15.1.2. (Added) Document an annual inspection in letter format including type of inspection,
date, functional area inspected, key personnel contacted/interviewed, findings, observations and
recommended corrective actions (if appropriate). Route reports through the chief of safety and
the wing commander to the unit commander. Track open inspection findings and provide timely
status reports until closeout.
2.15.1.3. (Added) The unit annual inspection may be combined with other safety inspections
required by AFI 91-202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program.
2.15.1.4. (Added) The annual inspection must be completed by the end of the month, 12 months
after the previous year’s inspection.

Mission Reports (SAAMREP) and DULL SWORD reports applicable to the wing for applicable
nuclear surety related issues.
2.15.6.1. (Added) Accompany the installation/wing PRP monitor periodically on visits to staff
agencies (Military Equal Opportunity, medical and dental facilities, etc.) involved with PRP.
When the NSM accompanies the installation/wing PRP monitor on a visit, it may be used to
meet the requirements of the PRP portion of the unit annual nuclear surety inspection.

AFI91-101_AMCSUP 7 OCTOBER 2011                                                                 5


2.15.17. (Added) Publish policy for appointing, training, and defining responsibilities of a
UNSR.
2.15.18. (Added) The NSM will fly quarterly on a nuclear airlift (actual or training) mission to
monitor the mission and base support operations. The NSM performing the observation will not
act in a primary/training crew position on more than two quarterly observations per calendar
year. Additionally, the NSM will not act in a primary/training crew position on two consecutive
quarterly mission observations. Send a copy of the trip report to HQ AMC/SEW.
2.16.2. Nuclear surety training is only required for those with access to nuclear weapons.
2.17.1. The re-test will, as a minimum, examine areas in which the individual failed to
demonstrate acceptable understanding on the initial test. The re-test will be structured the same
as the original test (i.e., subjective or objective).
2.17.4. The wing may supplement the AF standardized nuclear surety lesson plan with unique
mission requirements. The retraining and retest should ensure the same level of understanding of
the basic concepts of nuclear surety as the original training and test. Send the lesson plan to HQ
AMC/SEW for approval.
2.18.1.5. (Added) Below the MAJCOM level, a Nuclear Surety Council (NSC) is established to
monitor, evaluate, and improve policies and procedures for nuclear airlift operations. A NSC is

Terms
Nuclear Surety Manager (NSM)—As used in this supplement, the term NSM identifies
individuals performing nuclear surety functions as a primary duty at AMC headquarters and
wing-level.
Unit Nuclear Surety Representative (UNSR)—As used in this supplement, the term UNSR
identifies an individual responsible for many of the nuclear surety program requirements at the
group and squadron level.
Nuclear Surety Staff Assistance Visit (NSSAV)— The Secretary of the Air Force established
the NSSAV program to assist nuclear tasked units, on a non-attribution basis, in maintaining
effective nuclear surety programs. The NSSAV is an opportunity to receive assistance from
experienced headquarters personnel who write nuclear surety policy and guidance. It is not an
inspection nor is it intended to prepare units to pass Nuclear Surety Inspections (NSI). NSSAV
will not give a rating, score, grade, or assessment statements about units, however if the NSSAV
team identifies critical systemic deficiencies, they can recommend that the wing conduct root
cause analysis of each critical deficiency and provide results to the NSSAV Lead Division or
Team Chief. The NSSAV also provides an opportunity for resolution and clarification of issues
between the unit and headquarters functional managers. See AFI 91-121 Nuclear Surety Staff
Assistance Visit Program, for NSSAV program management
