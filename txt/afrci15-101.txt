2. Procedures for On-Site Weather Support. (NOTE: These procedures apply if the military host has
a full-service weather station on the installation. Most active duty bases and Air Reserve Bases fall into
this category).
   2.1. The local base weather station provides or arranges day-to-day peacetime support.
   2.2. Contact HQ AFRC/DO, Weather Services Section to coordinate support for off-site exercise or
   ORI deployments. Provide at least three months of lead-time if possible.
   2.3. The gaining MAJCOM provides contingency and wartime weather support as a function of war
   planning. AFRC flying units become aligned with their weather support provider either during the
   deployment process or at the employment location.

3. Procedures for Off-Site Weather Support. (NOTE: These procedures apply if the host is not a mil-
itary unit or does not have a full-service weather station on the installation. Most Air Reserve Stations fall
into this category).
   3.1. The agency responsible for airfield operations normally provides weather observing. The gain-
   ing MAJCOM/DOW provides or arranges additional day-to-day peacetime support in coordination
   with HQ AFRC/DO. Support is usually provided via phone/fax/Internet from an active duty weather
   unit.
   3.2. Contact HQ AFRC/DO, Weather Services Section, to coordinate support for off-site exercise or
   ORI deployments. Provide at least three months of lead-time if possible.
   3.3. The gaining MAJCOM provides contingency and wartime weather support as a function of war
   planning. AFRC flying units become aligned with their weather support provider either during the
   deployment process or at the employment location.
