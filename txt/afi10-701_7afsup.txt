SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This updated
instruction adds responsibilities for MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs (paragraph 1.4.8), Air Combat
Command (ACC) (paragraph 1.4.8), commanders (paragraph 1.4.15), requirement to budget,
acquire and distribute OPSEC awareness and education materials (1.4.15.8.2), OPSEC Program
Managers (PM), Signature Management Officers, Coordinators and Planners (paragraph 1.4.16)
and all Air Force personnel (paragraph 1.4.17). Chapter 2 has been renamed Signature
Management and OPSEC Process has been moved to Chapter 4. OPSEC measures have been
deleted from chapter 4 and are now reflected to read countermeasures (paragraph 4.6).
Acquisition planning has been removed from chapter 3, OPSEC Planning and placed within
chapter 8, OPSEC Contract Requirements. OPSEC Awareness Education and Training has been
moved to chapter 5, OPSEC Education and Training, and includes requirement to provide
awareness information to AF family members. OPSEC assessments has been moved to chapter
6 and titled Assessments. Additions to chapter 6 include web site link to the OPSEC Core
Capabilities Checklists (paragraph 6.1.5), requirements regarding the assessment of information
on AF public and private web sites (paragraph 6.5), and requirement to utilize the operations
security collaborations architecture (OSCAR) tool for annual assessments (paragraph 6.6.4). Air
Force OPSEC annual awards is located in chapter 7 and chapter 8 includes information regarding
OPSEC as a requirement within government contracts.

                                         GENERAL

1.1. Introduction: OPSEC is a military capability within Information Operations (IO). IO is
the integrated employment of three operational elements: influence operations (IFO), electronic
warfare operations and network warfare operations. IO aims to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or
usurp adversarial human or automated decision-making while protecting our own. IFO employs
the military capabilities of military information support operations (MISO), OPSEC, military
deception (MILDEC), counterintelligence operations, public affairs (PA) operations and
counterpropaganda operations to affect behaviors, protect operations, communicate
commanders’ intent and project accurate information to achieve desired effects across the
operational environment. OPSEC’s desired effect is to influence the adversary’s behavior and
actions by protecting friendly operations and activities.
1.2. Operational Context:
   1.2.1. Operational Focus. The OPSEC program is an operations function or activity and its
   goals are information superiority and optimal mission effectiveness. The emphasis is on
   OPERATIONS and the assurance of effective mission accomplishment. To ensure effective
   implementation across organizational and functional lines the organization’s OPSEC
   Program Manager (PM), Signature Management Officer (SMO), or coordinator will reside in
   the operations and/or plans element of an organization or report directly to the commander.
   For those organizations with no traditional operations or plans element, the commander must
   decide the most logical area to place management and coordination of the organization’s
   OPSEC program while focusing on operations and the mission of the organization. Figure
   1.2 illustrates the AF OPSEC functional structure.

Figure 1.1. OPSEC Functional Structure
 6                                                         AFI10-701_7AFSUP_I 16 MAY 2014


     1.2.2. Operational effectiveness is enhanced when commanders and other decision-makers
     apply OPSEC from the earliest stages of planning. OPSEC involves a series of analyses to
     examine the planning, preparation, execution and post execution phases of any operation or
     activity across the entire spectrum of military action and in any operational environment.
     OPSEC analysis provides decision-makers with a means of weighing how much risk they
     are willing to accept in particular operational circumstances in the same way as operations
     risk management allows commanders to assess risk in mission planning.
     1.2.3. OPSEC must be closely integrated and synchronized with other IFO capabilities,
     security disciplines, and all aspects of protected operations (see references listed in
     Attachment 1).
1.3. Purpose:
     1.3.1. The purpose of OPSEC is to reduce the vulnerability of Air Force missions by
     eliminating or reducing successful adversary collection and exploitation of critical
     information. OPSEC applies to all activities that prepare, sustain, or employ forces during all
     phases of operations.
     1.3.2. OPSEC Definition. OPSEC is a process of identifying, analyzing and controlling
     critical information indicating friendly actions associated with military operations and other
     activities to:
        1.3.2.1. Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems.
        1.3.2.2. Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed, and
        interpreted to derive critical information in time to be useful to adversaries.
        1.3.2.3. Select and execute measures that eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the
        vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary exploitation.
1.4. Roles and Responsibilities:
     1.4.1. Air Force organizations must develop and integrate OPSEC into their mission
     planning to ensure critical information and indicators are identified. At a minimum, the Air
     Force will integrate OPSEC into the following missions: military strategy, operational and
     tactical planning and execution, military indoctrination, support activities, contingency,
     combat and peacetime operations and exercises, communications-computer architectures and
     processing, critical infrastructure protection, weapons systems, Research, Development, Test
     and Evaluation (RDT&E), Air Force specialized training, inspections, acquisition and
     procurement, medical operations and professional military education. Although the OPSEC
     program helps commanders make and implement decisions, the decisions are the
     commander’s responsibility. Commanders must understand the risk to the mission and then
     determine which countermeasures are required.
     1.4.2. The Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans and Requirements
     (AF/A3/5). The AF/A3/5 is the OPR for implementing DoD OPSEC policy and guidance.
     This responsibility is assigned to the Director of Cyber and Space Operations (AF/A3Z).
     AF/A3Z will:
        1.4.2.1. Establish an AF OPSEC program focused on senior leadership involvement
        using the management tools of assessments, surveys, training, education, threat analyses,
        resourcing, and awareness that, at a minimum, includes:
AFI10-701_7AFSUP_I 16 MAY 2014                                                                 7


        1.4.2.1.1. Assign a full-time AF OPSEC PM (O-4 or civilian equivalent).
        1.4.2.1.2. Establish AF OPSEC support capabilities that provide for program
        development, planning, training, assessment, surveys, operational support, and
        readiness training.
        1.4.2.1.3. Conduct annual reviews and validations of the AF OPSEC program as
        prescribed by DoD and AF policy/guidance.
        1.4.2.1.4. Ensure OPSEC surveys are conducted for subordinate commands and
        agencies in order to enhance mission effectiveness and reduce risk.
     1.4.2.2. Develop Air Force Departmental publications to define policy, guidance,
     responsibilities and authorities to establish the internal management processes necessary
     to carry out DoD policy/guidance. Provide copies of all current service OPSEC program
     directives and/or policy implementation documents to the Joint Staff J-3.
     1.4.2.3. Support OPSEC programs at the national, DoD and Joint-level as necessary.

         throughout NAF/wing/group/squadron facilities.
  1.4.17. All Air Force Personnel: OPSEC is everyone’s responsibility. Ideally, the AF uses
  OPSEC measures to protect its critical information. Failure to properly implement OPSEC
  measures can result in serious injury or death to our personnel; damage to weapons systems,
  equipment and facilities; loss of sensitive technologies; and mission degradation or failure.
  OPSEC is a continuous process and an inherent part of military culture. Failure to implement
  directed OPSEC measures will be considered by commanders/directors for appropriate
  disciplinary action. OPSEC must be fully integrated into the execution of all Air Force
  operations and supporting activities. All AF personnel (active duty, reserve, ANG, Air Force
  civilians, and DoD contractors) will:
     1.4.17.1. Be familiar with their organization’s critical information.
     1.4.17.2. Protect critical and/or sensitive information from disclosure.
         1.4.17.2.1. When publicly posting or publishing work-related information that
         potentially contains critical or sensitive information airmen are encouraged to solicit
         the advice of their immediate supervisor, security office and/or OPSEC
         PM/SM/coordinator. This will aid in preventing disclosure of critical and/or sensitive
         information within the public domain. Personnel that do not know what information
         is critical to an organization cannot reasonably conclude that posting or publishing
         information will not result in an unauthorized disclosure.
             1.4.17.2.1.1. This includes, but is not limited to letters, resumes, articles,
             electronic mail (e-mail), web site postings, web log (blog) postings, internet
             message board discussions, or other forms of dissemination or documentation.
             1.4.17.2.1.2. Supervisors will provide guidance to personnel regarding critical
             and/or sensitive information to ensure it is not disclosed in public forums. Each
             organization’s OPSEC PM/SM/coordinator will advise supervisors on means to
             prevent the public disclosure of critical and/or sensitive information.
             1.4.17.2.1.3. Encryption serves as one measure to protect critical or sensitive
             information transmitted over unclassified networks. Encrypt all e-mail messages
             containing critical information, OPSEC indicators, and other sensitive
             information. (AFI 33-119, Air Force Messaging Paragraph 6.1.2)
         1.4.17.2.2. Do not publicly disseminate, or publish photographs displaying critical
         and/or sensitive information. Examples include but are not limited to: Improvised
         Explosive Device strikes, battle scenes, casualties, destroyed or damaged equipment,
         personnel killed in action (both friendly and adversary), and the protective measures
         of military facilities.

        1.4.17.2.3. Do not publicly reference, disseminate, or publish critical and/or sensitive
        information already compromised. This provides further unnecessary exposure of the
        compromised information and may serve as validation.
        1.4.17.2.4. Actively encourage others (including family members and family
        readiness groups) to protect critical and/or sensitive information.
        1.4.17.2.5. Destroy (burn, shred, etc.) critical and/or sensitive unclassified
        information no longer needed to prevent the inadvertent disclosure and/or
        reconstruction of this material.
     1.4.17.3. Implement protection measures as ordered by the commander, director, or an
     individual in an equivalent position.
     1.4.17.4. Know who their organization’s OPSEC PM and Coordinator is and contact
     them for questions, concerns, or recommendations for OPSEC or signature management
     related topics.
     1.4.17.5. Consider attempts by unauthorized personnel to solicit critical and/or sensitive
     information as human intelligence (HUMINT) gathering and consider it a HUMINT
     incident.
        1.4.17.5.1. AF personnel who have been involved in or have knowledge of a possible
        incident will report all facts immediately to the nearest supporting AFOSI office as
        required by AFI 71-101, Vol 4, Counterintelligence.
        1.4.17.5.2. If these offices are not readily available, HUMINT incidents will be
        reported to the organization’s security manager or commander who will ensure that,
        without exception, reports are relayed as securely and expeditiously within 24 hours
        to the nearest AFOSI organization.

                                            Chapter 2

                                SIGNATURE MANAGEMENT

2.1. Signature Management. Signature management (SM) utilizes a process of profiling day-
to-day observable activities and operational trends at installations and each of its resident units.
SM incorporates preparatory methodologies of OPSEC and MILDEC creating synergies and
resource efficiencies for both the OPSEC and MILDEC wing/installation programs. These
methodologies result in identified processes and details that can be used in efforts to defend or
exploit operational profiles resident at a given military installation. Defense of operational
profiles is accomplished by implementing protective measures to deny or mitigate adversary
collection of critical information. Development of protective measures is often accomplished
using MILDEC tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). The TTPs used for protection of
operational profiles are collectively referred to as Deception in Support of OPSEC (DISO).
NOTE: The guidance in this chapter is intended for Signature Management personnel at the
wing/installation level. The Signature Management Officer (SMO) and Signature Management
NCO (SMNCO) take on the responsibilities of the OPSEC and Military Deception (MILDEC)
PM.
   2.1.1. Signature Management is administered through a wing or installation SMO/SMNCO.
   An SMO/SMNCO can be appointed the primary or alternate wing or installation OPSEC PM.
   When an air component commander’s MILDEC plan requires Air Force wings and
   installations to present specified observable activities, the air component commander’s
   MILDEC planner will determine the actions required by the supporting unit(s) and will
   communicate those requirements to the SMO/SMNCO.
   2.1.2. Signature management, OPSEC, and MILDEC are a commander's responsibility. The
   SMO/SMNCO will define the local operating environment and capture process points that
   present key signatures and profiles with critical information value. This process, known as
   the Base Profiling Process (BPP), is the deliberate effort to identify functional areas and the
   observables they produce to contribute to the overall signature of day-to-day activities and
   operational trends. Once the BPP is complete, the results can be used to develop a wing level
   CIL and identify key process points for potential protection or exploitation. This ultimately
   provides commanders several options to exploit or deny operational signatures to ensure
   mission effectiveness.
2.2. Wing or installation commanders will:
   2.2.1. Appoint in writing a primary and alternate SMO/SMNCO who will function as the
   OPR for all SM activities. The primary SMO will be an O-3 or above, or civilian equivalent.
   The alternate SMO will be an E-6 or above, or civilian equivalent. Under no circumstances
   will contract personnel be appointed as a primary or alternate SMO/SMNCO. At a
   minimum, SMO/SMNCOs will have a secret clearance (recommend Top Secret) and have
   two years retainability in the position or as area tour length dictates (remote tours only).
   Organizations requiring appointment of an SMO/SMNCO for less than two years will
   request, in writing, a waiver through their MAJCOM OPSEC PM from AF/A3Z-CI.
       2.2.1.1. In the event that host and tenant organizations on a given installation are
       subordinate to different MAJCOMs, the host MAJCOM OPSEC PM will coordinate and
 22                                                       AFI10-701_7AFSUP_I 16 MAY 2014


      document how SM using protective and exploitation countermeasures will be conducted
      on that installation.
          2.2.1.1.1. All wings based on the installation, regardless of their MAJCOM
          affiliation, will have a SMO/SMNCO assigned. However, the host wing/installation
          SMO/SMNCO will act as the lead for all SM activities. This agreement will be
          stipulated on a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and should carry the weight of
          each signatory Wing Commander on the MOA as the designated SMO/SMNCO
          executes their duties for the installation.
          2.2.1.1.2. The substance of this arrangement will be documented and kept on file for
          every installation for which this condition applies and incorporated into MAJCOM
          supplements to this instruction. A copy of the MOA will be forwarded to the
          MAJCOM OPSEC PM and AF/A3Z-CI.
   2.2.2. Submit request through servicing MPF for award of special experience (SEI) 9O or
   234 as appropriate for individuals appointed as SMO/SMNCOs who meet all qualifications
   as identified in the Air Force Officer and Enlisted Classification Directories.
2.3. Signature Management Officer/Signature Management Non-Commissioned Officer
will:
   2.3.1. Follow guidance in this instruction and when appointed/assigned for MILDEC, follow
   AFI 10-704, Military Deception Program.
   2.3.2. Advise the commander on all SM related matters, to include developing and
   recommending policy, guidance, and instructions. Review periodically for currency and
   update as necessary.
   2.3.3. Use the base profiling process to develop and maintain a master checklist of all
   activities associated with the mission areas for the wing or installation (i.e., recall, mobility
   processing, aircraft generation, airlift load generation and marshaling, munitions, personnel
   and equipment deployment, etc.). The checklist will be modified, as required, to support
   tasks associated with supported commander’s requirements. Therefore, well-developed
   master checklists are mandatory. NOTE: MAJCOM subordinate organizations below the air
   component level are NOT required to develop supporting MILDEC tabs (C-3A) to combatant
   command plans or supporting air component plans.
   2.3.4. Develop and maintain a current commander approved CIL.
   2.3.5. Implement SM execution checklists as directed or authorized by their wing or
   installation commander, MAJCOM OPSEC PM, or the supported air component commander,
   as appropriate.
   2.3.6. Identify key personnel involved in the planning and execution of each of the major
   functional mission areas, and select subject matter experts (SMEs) who can assist in the
   development, exercising, and execution of the protective or exploitation countermeasures and
   activities. Grant access to SM material and plans on the commander's authority alone (this
   may be delegated to the SMO/SMNCO for expediency as determined by the commander).
   2.3.7. Work closely with antiterrorism, force protection, information protection, PA, web
   administrators, and other officials designated by the commander who share responsibility for
   the protection and release of information to ensure critical information is protected.
AFI10-701_7AFSUP_I 16 MAY 2014                                                                23


   2.3.8. Answer questions, develop guidance and provide advice to PA and other information
   releasing officials concerning protecting critical information during reviews of public and/or
   private web pages.
   2.3.9. Attend the Air Force Signature Management Course within 90 days of appointment or
   by the next available class. If scheduling conflicts exist, MAJCOM OPSEC PMs must
   document and ensure SMO/SMNCOs are scheduled for the next available course not to
   exceed 180 days. If training is not completed within 180 days, MAJCOM OPSEC PMs must
   request a waiver from AF/A3Z-CI.
   2.3.10. Conduct SM exercises at the wing or installation as directed by the parent
   MAJCOMs supplemental guidance.
   2.3.11. Work with exercise evaluation teams to observe and evaluate mission profiles and
   signatures, as well as measures of effectiveness (MOE) and measures of performance (MOP)
   that assess the organizations ability to mitigate loss of critical information. Evaluate how
   organization personnel execute protection or exploitation measures. Any deficiencies or best
   practices will be submitted in after action reports and to the AF lessons learned database
   (https://www.jllis.mil/usaf/) when applicable. Lessons learned will be used to develop

                                           Chapter 3

                                     OPSEC PLANNING

3.1. General. This chapter provides direction for planners at wings, Air Force Component
Headquarters (AFFOR and AOC) to integrate OPSEC into plans. Air Force forces can be under
observation at their peacetime bases and locations, in training or exercises, while moving, or
when deployed to the field conducting actual operations. OPSEC methodology provides
systematic and comprehensive analysis designed to identify observable friendly actions that
could betray intentions or capabilities. Therefore, OPSEC principles must be integrated into
operational, support, exercise, and acquisition planning. All plans will be reviewed periodically
to ensure currency and updated when required.
   3.1.1. OPSEC PMs, SMO/SMNCOs, or Coordinators will assist organization planners to
   incorporate protection of critical information and indicators into supported operational plans
   (OPLANS) and supporting plans. They will also assist exercise planners in developing
   master scenario events listings (MSEL) and MOP to train organization personnel in the
   application or execution of countermeasures (See AFDD 2, Operations and Organizations,
   for more information concerning MOE and MOP.
   3.1.2. OPSEC Planners will follow guidance as outlined in AFI 13-1AOC, Volume 3,
   Operational Procedures-Air and Space Operations Center, and Chapter 3 of this document.
3.2. Operational Planning. OPSEC will be included in all OPLANs, concept plans
(CONPLANs), functional plans (FUNCPLANs), and operation orders (OPORDS), etc.. Planners
will use existing TTPs to develop Tab C to Appendix 3 to Annex C to the OPORD or OPLAN.
The planning staff will identify critical information and OPSEC indicators from all functional
areas requiring protection throughout each phase of the operation. Risk assessments will be used
to identify applicable countermeasures to mitigate any unacceptable operational risks. MOP and
MOE will be developed for each OPSEC measure.
   3.2.1. Operational planning is typically focused at the Air Force Component Headquarters
   (AFFOR and AOC), with reach-back support outside the theater when appropriate. When
   planning duties are split, all responsible entities will integrate OPSEC into their planning
   efforts (see also JP 3-13.3, Operations Security, Chapter 3). As the supported organization,
   the theater AOC will resolve debates and provide general guidance.
3.3. Support Planning. Integrate OPSEC into all wartime and contingency plans as well as
support plans, i.e., programming plans and in-garrison expeditionary site plans.
3.4. Exercise Planning. In order to enhance combat readiness and improve crisis response,
OPSEC will be included in all exercise plans (EXPLANs). Specific OPSEC and/or signature
management scenarios will be included in the exercise MSELs with MOE and MOP to assess the
proficiency of functional planners to mitigate loss of critical information and organization
personnel to execute countermeasures. Deficiencies or best practices will be submitted to the AF
lessons learned database (https://www.jllis.mil/usaf/) when applicable to assist in the
assessment of critical information being posting in public forums. Lessons learned will be used
to develop tactics improvement proposals (TIPs) IAW AFI 10-204, Readiness Exercises and
After-Action Reporting Program, and AFI 11-260, Tactics Development Program.
AFI10-701_7AFSUP_I 16 MAY 2014                                                               25


   3.4.1. OPSEC measures will also be employed during exercises to minimize observations of
   sensitive training activities by adversary surveillance and treaty verification activities.
3.5. Acquisition Planning. OPSEC requirements will be determined for all acquisitions and
contractor-supported efforts beginning with operational capabilities requirements generation and
continues through design, development, test and evaluation, fielding, sustainment and system
disposal. When required to protect sensitive military operations, commanders will ensure
OPSEC requirements are added to contracts. Commanders will evaluate contractor-developed
and proposed OPSEC programs for compliance with required standards. NOTE: For more
detailed planning instructions, refer to AFI 10-400 series publications.

                                           Chapter 4

                                      OPSEC PROCESS

4.1. General: OPSEC is an iterative five-step process: 1) Identify critical information; 2)
Analyze threats; 3) Analyze vulnerabilities; 4) Assess risk; and 5) Apply countermeasures.
Although normally applied in a sequential manner the process during deliberate or crisis action
planning, dynamic situations may require any step to be revisited at any time.
4.2. Identify Critical Information:
   4.2.1. Critical information is a specific fact about friendly intentions, capabilities, and
   activities vitally needed by adversaries for them to plan and act effectively, so as to guarantee
   failure or unacceptable consequences for friendly mission accomplishment. The product of
   the first step in the OPSEC process is to record your critical information in a critical
   information list (CIL).
   4.2.2. Critical information is best identified by the individuals responsible for the planning
   and execution of the organization’s mission. A working group or staff planning team can
   most effectively accomplish this task. Once a CIL is developed, commanders must approve
   the list and then ensure their critical information is protected and/or controlled.
   4.2.3. Critical information will be identified at the earliest stages of planning an operation or
   activity and continuously updated as necessary to support mission effectiveness.
4.3. Analyze Threats:
   4.3.1. A threat is an adversary with the capability and intent to undertake action detrimental
   to the success of program activities or operations.
   4.3.2. The primary source of local threat information is your local AFOSI detachment. For
   mission related intelligence support, contact your local intelligence unit. Generic validated
   threat data is provided by the Defense Intelligence Agency via the OPSEC assessment tool,
   OSCAR.
   4.3.3. Intelligence organizations analyze the threat through research of intelligence,
   counterintelligence, and open source information to identify who is likely to disrupt, deny,
   degrade, or destroy planned operations.
   4.3.4. A threat assessment should identify adversaries, their goals, what they already know,
   their capability and intent to collect critical information, and potential courses of action.
4.4. Analyze Vulnerabilities:
   4.4.1. A vulnerability exists when the adversary is capable of collecting critical information
   or indicators, analyzing them and then acting quickly enough to impact friendly objectives.
   The vulnerability can be your procedures, a failure of traditional security, poor judgment on
   the part of leadership, the fact that we process critical information on data based systems, or
   the system’s design itself.
       4.4.1.1. An indicator is a friendly detectable action and open-source information that can
       be interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive critical information.
AFI10-701_7AFSUP_I 16 MAY 2014                                                                 27


   4.4.2. A vulnerability exists when the adversary is capable of collecting critical information
   and/or indicators, correctly analyzing them, and then takes timely action. The adversary
   essentially uses your critical information to support their decision-making process. The
   adversary has then exploited your vulnerability to obtain an advantage over you.
   4.4.3. A vulnerability analysis is the examination of your processes, projects or missions to
   determine if you have inherent, naturally occurring or self-induced vulnerabilities or
   indicators that put your critical information and thus your mission at risk.
4.5. Assess Risk:
   4.5.1. A risk is a measure of the potential degree to which protected information is subject to
   loss through adversary exploitation. Risk is assessed as the probability an adversary will
   gain knowledge of your critical information and the impact (on your mission) if the adversary
   is successful. A working group or staff planning team must conduct a risk assessment and
   develop recommended countermeasures based on operational planning and current operating
   environment. A typical risk assessment will:
       4.5.1.1. Compare vulnerabilities identified with the probability of an adversary being
       able to exploit it in time to be useful to determine a risk level.
       4.5.1.2. Determine potential countermeasures to reduce vulnerabilities with the highest
       risk. The most desirable countermeasures are those that combine the highest possible
       protection with the least resource requirements and/or adverse effect on operational
       effectiveness.
4.6. Apply Countermeasures:
   4.6.1. Countermeasures are anything that effectively negates or mitigates an adversary’s
   ability to exploit vulnerabilities. Countermeasures may be both offensive and defensive in
   nature.
   4.6.2. Potential countermeasures, among other actions are, camouflage, concealment,
   deception (CCD), intentional deviations from normal patterns, and direct strikes against
   adversary collection.
   4.6.3. The working group or staff planning team through the OPSEC PM, SMO or
   Coordinator will submit recommended countermeasures for commander approval through the
   operational planning process for employment or through appropriate staffing process.
   Organizations that do not have or require a planning cell will submit recommended
   countermeasures to the commander through appropriate staffing process.
   4.6.4. Countermeasures must be synchronized with other components of IO to achieve
   synergies in efforts to influence the adversary’s perceptions and situational awareness. Care
   must be taken so that countermeasures do not become vulnerabilities or unacceptable
   indicators themselves.
   4.6.5. During the execution of countermeasures, the adversary’s reaction to the measures is
   monitored, if possible, to provide feedback that can be used to assess effectiveness or
   determine potential unintended consequences.

                           OPSEC EDUCATION AND TRAINING

5.1. General. All Air Force personnel (military and civilian) and contractors who have access
to mission critical information require a general knowledge of threats, vulnerabilities and their
responsibilities associated with protecting critical information. This is accomplished through
initial and annual OPSEC training. Standardized AF OPSEC awareness training located on the
AF Advanced Distributed Learning Service is the baseline training required for all personnel.
Organization specific training will be provided in addition to this training to ensure all personnel
in the Air Force are aware of local threats, vulnerabilities and critical information unique to their
duty assignment. OPSEC PMs/SMO/SMNCOs/Coordinators, and planners assigned to OPSEC
positions require more in-depth training designed to ensure proper management, planning, and
execution of organizational OPSEC programs.
5.2. All Personnel:
   5.2.1. Awareness education will be provided to all personnel (military, civilian and
   contractors) upon initial entrance/accession into military service.
   5.2.2. Awareness education provided in accession programs will encompass what OPSEC is,
   its purpose, threat awareness and the individual's role in protecting critical information.
   5.2.3. Organization-specific initial OPSEC awareness training will be provided at each new
   duty location as part of in-processing and annually thereafter, at a minimum. Personnel must
   understand the scope of the threats, the nature of the vulnerabilities and their responsibility to
   execute countermeasures to protect critical information and organization specific OPSEC
   indicators. Annual training must include, at a minimum, updated threat and vulnerability
   information, changes to critical information and new procedures and/or countermeasures
   implemented by the organization.
       5.2.3.1. In addition, commanders/directors shall encourage assigned personnel to share
       OPSEC awareness information with family members (both immediate and extended) and
       social network "friends". This will ensure family members and friends understand how
       adversaries can use public media sources such as but not limited to web sites, blogs,
       social networking sites, newspapers, and television to obtain critical information that can
       be used to target AF members and their families.
       5.2.3.2. Procurement of low value promotional and awareness aids such as pens, pencils,
       magnets, key chains, lanyards, etc., is authorized for the exclusive intent to promote
       OPSEC awareness and education in accordance with organizational missions. For
       Guidance, refer to AFI 65-601, Vol 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures.
   5.2.4. OPSEC PMs/SMO/SMNCOs/Coordinators will provide OPSEC training or training
   materials to contract employees within 90 days of employees’ initial assignment to the
   contract.

  assessment team, inspection team, and Operations Security Working Group (OWG) members
  are required to complete OPSEC orientation training within 30 days of assignment to OPSEC
  duties. The Interagency OPSEC Support Staff’s (IOSS) multimedia product “An
  Introduction to OPSEC (An Interactive Primer by the Department of Defense)” is the
  accepted method for completing OPSEC orientation. It is high recommended personnel seek
  out additional OPSEC training to assist in accomplishing their duties. Information regarding
  required and additional OPSEC training can be received from OPSEC PMs or
  SMO/SMNCOs.
  5.3.3. OPSEC Planner Mission Readiness Training (MRT). Personnel working as OPSEC
  planners in an AOC require MRT that encompasses initial qualification training (IQT),
  mission qualification training (MQT), and continuation training (CT). IQT will consist of
  formal training (either SMC or OSPE-2500, OPSEC Analysis and Program Management
  Course). MQT will consist of mission specific training and will be documented via
  Stan/Eval processes. CT will be provided as needed. MRT will be accomplished during
  training exercises.
  5.3.4. Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAE) and Contracting Officer Technical
  Representatives (COTR) will complete OPSEC training designed for QAE and COTR duties
  provided by the OPSEC PM/SMO/SMNCO/Coordinator within 90 days of being assigned
  duties. OPSEC PM/SMO/SMNCO/Coordinators are encouraged to use the training located

                                           Chapter 6

                                       ASSESSMENTS

6.1. General:
   6.1.1. Assessments are performed to achieve two specific purposes: To ensure required
   policies and procedures are in place to protect critical information and to gauge the overall
   effectiveness of countermeasures (See Table 6.1 for OPSEC assessment types).
   6.1.2. The      Air    Force       provides      several      tools    to      assist    OPSEC
   PMs/SMO/SMNCOs/Coordinators and planners to obtain information and data to perform
   risk analysis. These tools assist in assessing the level of exposure of critical information and
   operational indicators to adversary observation, surveillance, and intelligence sensors.
   OPSEC planners, PMs and Coordinators use assessment results within the risk management
   process to determine countermeasures which can mitigate or negate risk to operations.
   6.1.3. Assessment of program effectiveness is accomplished through the development of
   MOP and MOE. MOP are developed to measure how well an activity is performed via the
   execution of countermeasures. MOE measure how well an activity achieved its intended
   effect. Any deficiencies or best practices identified are documented in lessons learned and
   TIPs. Inspector General (IG) inspections are also used to assess organization compliance,
   operational readiness, and nuclear surety. Submit TIPs IAW AFI 11-260.
   6.1.4. OPSEC PMs, SMO/SMNCO and Coordinators will utilize the OPSEC risk assessment
   tool OSCAR to accomplish annual assessments and program reviews.
   6.1.5. For assistance in preparing for inspections and assessments, utilize the OPSEC Core
   Capabilities Checklists provided at the below link to the Air Force Inspection Agency’s
   (AFIA) web site. The AFIA checklists are divided into functional levels (wing, unit and
   AOC) and provide the basics for maintaining your OPSEC program. MAJCOM and AF IG
   teams      will     utilize   these      checklists    when     conducting       inspections.
   https://webapps.afrc.af.mil/afia/SearchChecklist.aspx?Command=AFIA&Type=CI&St
   ate=live&Dir=A3 .
   6.1.5. (7AF) 7 AF expects all units assigned or attached to 7 AF to protect critical
   information by following the Compliance Inspection Checklists (CIC) for their respective
   program level. For example, 7 AF will perform all the policy and guidance and program
   management duties as listed in AFI 10-701 and the CIC for NAF level OPSEC program. 7
   AF OPSEC programs will be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of implemented
   measures by inspecting for compliance to regulations by assessing the program for
   completeness and by surveying the OPSEC profile. Tools available to accomplish this
   include: OPSEC self-assessments, SAVs, OPSEC surveys, multi-disciplinary vulnerability
   assessments (MDVA), and telecommunication monitoring assessment program (TMAP).
      6.1.5.1. (Added-7AF) 7 AF OPSEC PMs, SMOs and OPSEC Coordinators are required
      to maintain a continuity book that includes the last three years of data. A program that
      indicate it was only created to “pass the inspection” and does not show sustained
      continuity of the program between inspections will be downgraded. Unit programs that
32                                                     AFI10-701_7AFSUP_I 16 MAY 2014


     fail to comply with OPSEC PM and/or SMO retainability requirements and do not have
     an approved waiver on file will also be documented.
     6.1.5.2. (Added-7AF) Approved OPSEC and SM checklists for IG and self-inspection
     reside on the MICT web site and are used during compliance inspections. 7 AF units are
     encouraged to use these checklists during their internal self-inspection processes.
  6.1.6. Any request for external assessments must be made through your respective HHQ
  OPSEC PMs.
  6.1.7. MAJCOM OPSEC PMs are the focal point for requesting and scheduling all external
  assessments and setting all priorities between command organizations.
6.2. Annual OPSEC Program Review:
  6.2.1. The Annual OPSEC program review is a continual processes that involve combining
  data collected from MOP, MOE, exercise after action reports, lessons learned, nuclear surety,
  operational readiness/compliance inspections, and annually conducted self-assessments/self-
  inspections. Annual program reviews will be accomplished utilizing OSCAR and report to
  the HHQ OPSEC PM.           This has been assigned Report Control Symbol (RCS) DD-
  INTEL(A) 2228.
  6.2.2. OPSEC PMs, SMO/SMNCOs, and Coordinators will conduct annual program reviews
  to ensure the health of their program, evaluate compliance with applicable policies and to
  identify short-falls and vulnerabilities.
  6.2.3. Annual OPSEC Program Reviews will provide information relating to the following
  areas:
     6.2.3.1. Executive Summary: Full-time OPSEC PM appointed, budget plan developed,
     level of importance within the organization.
     6.2.3.2. OPSEC Initiatives/Projects/Successes: How is the commander making OPSEC
     a priority? (Policy and guidance, social networking site reviews, etc.)
     6.2.3.3. OPSEC Training and Awareness: Has the commander assigned a fully trained
     SMO/SMNCO to the SMO/SMNCO position? How is OPSEC awareness education and
     training conducted in the organization? (Commander’s call, unit newsletter, incorporating
     OPSEC into exercises).
     6.2.3.4. OPSEC in Operational Planning: How has the commander incorporated OPSEC
     into the unit’s operational plans? (Implementing OPSEC measures, unique tools used to
     incorporate OPSEC, integration efforts)
     6.2.3.5. Assessment/Surveys: Does the assigned OPSEC PMs have an established
     OSCAR account? Total number of assessments and surveys accomplished to determine
     the overall effectiveness of the unit’s OPSEC program?
  6.2.4. At MAJCOM-level, this report will be signed by the Director responsible for the
  MAJCOM’s OPSEC program or higher-level authority. At wing-level and below the
  commander or their designated representative will sign it.
AFI10-701_7AFSUP_I 16 MAY 2014                                                                 33


6.3. Staff Assistance Visit (SAV):
   6.3.1. SAVs may be conducted as needed by HHQ OPSEC PMs, SMOs or other
   organization SMEs to assist organizations in repairing dormant, non-compliant, deficient
   programs or for any other reason deemed necessary by the commander. The organization
   will request such assistance through their respective chain-of-command and will fund travel.
   SAVs check for program compliance (i.e., Special Interest Items, Air Force Instructions,
   MAJCOM policies, etc.), identify and resolve shortfalls, and provide guidance to OPSEC
   PMs, SMOs, and Coordinators as required.
   6.3.2. (Added-7AF) OPSEC assessments are performed for two purposes: to provide
   information and data into the OPSEC risk analysis process, and to measure a program’s
   compliance with establish policies and instructions. To meet these purposes, 7 AF units
   conduct self-assessments and SAVs.
   6.3.3. (Added-7AF) 7 AF units will conduct a self-assessment of their respective OPSEC
   program quarterly to identify short-falls and vulnerabilities. This data will be reported to HQ
   PACAF/A3TC in the annual report.
   6.3.4. (Added-7AF) The 7 AF OPSEC PM will conduct a SAV with subordinate units
   annually. The supported unit will be provided with a detailed report listing strengths as well
   as non-compliant items. At a minimum, the following will occur during a 7 AF or
   wing/group OPSEC PM SAV:
       6.3.4.1. (Added-7AF) Review content/structure of the organizational OPSEC continuity
       binder.
       6.3.4.2. (Added-7AF) Review initial/annual training documentation.
       6.3.4.3. (Added-7AF) Review self-assessment checklists to identify shortfalls with the
       OPSEC program.
       6.3.4.4. (Added-7AF) Discuss initiatives to increase overall OPSEC posture of the unit.
       6.3.4.5. (Added-7AF) Ensure commander’s involvement with the OPSEC program.
6.4. Survey:
   6.4.1. An OPSEC survey is the application of the OPSEC methodology by a team of subject
   matter experts to conduct a detailed analysis of all activities associated with a specific
   organization, operation, activity, exercise, or support function by employing the known
   collection capabilities of potential adversaries. The purpose of an OPSEC survey is to
   determine if OPSEC countermeasures are effectively mitigating identified threats and
   vulnerabilities.
       6.4.1.1. The survey requires a team of experts to look at an activity from an adversary’s
       perspective to determine if critical information may be disclosed through normal
       operations and functions, to identify vulnerabilities, and propose countermeasures to
       mitigate them.
       6.4.1.2. Survey team members attempt to use the collection techniques and tools of
       known adversaries. Commanders/directors are encouraged to use OPSEC support
       capabilities (reference Paragraph 6.6) to assist in conducting surveys, if available.
34                                                     AFI10-701_7AFSUP_I 16 MAY 2014


     6.4.1.3. (Added-7AF) The OPSEC survey is a method to determine if there is adequate
     protection of critical information during planning, preparation, execution, and post-
     execution phases of any operation or activity. It analyzes all associated functions to
     identify sources of information, what they disclose, and what can be derived from the
     information. The objective is to identify OPSEC vulnerabilities in operations and
     activities, which an adversary could exploit to degrade friendly effectiveness or surprise.
     The survey helps the commander monitor OPSEC measures and take further action to
     protect critical information. The OPSEC survey is a collection effort by a team of SMEs
     to reproduce the intelligence image projected by a specific operation or function in light
     of the known collection capabilities of potential adversaries. At least one of the
     following sub-surveys will be conducted quarterly:
        6.4.1.3.1. (Added-7AF) Human observation threats. Attempt to identify potential
        OPSEC vulnerabilities associated with physical security and information security by
        observing the base populace. During these observation periods the OPSEC team
        should verify personnel are properly storing restricted area badges, not discussing
        sensitive or classified information outside secure work areas, and following the 100%
        shred policy established by the USFK/CC. Coordinate with local AFOSI units to
        conduct a counterintelligence assessment at off installation establishments to
        determine the amount and types of information being discussed outside of secure
        work areas.
        6.4.1.3.2. (Added-7AF) Open source exploitation threats.               Conduct periodic
        webpage reviews to determine the types and amount of information concerning 7 AF
        and subordinate units/installations is available to foreign intelligence services.
        6.4.1.3.3. (Added-7AF) Establish procedures to assist PA offices with the review of
        information posted on public web pages before the launch of new web pages as
        outlined in AFI 33-129, Web Management and Internet Use. Ensure information
        listed on unit critical information lists or marked as For Official Use Only is not
        posted to public websites. If critical information is identified, coordinate with
        appropriate agencies to properly secure the information from inadvertent disclosure.
        6.4.1.3.4. (Added-7AF) Signals intelligence (SIGINT) threats. See paragraph 6.6.1.
        for further information regarding TMAP.
     6.4.1.4. (Added-7AF) Multi-Disciplinary Vulnerability Assessment (MDVA): These
     assessments combine network security, physical security, HVA, and TMAP. MDVAs
     are conducted to identify operations vulnerabilities, operational impacts, and exercise
     threat response procedures. MDVA requests will be submitted through your higher
     headquarters (HHQ) OPSEC PM.
     6.4.1.5. (Added-7AF) Trash Intelligence (TRASHINT) Assessment: TRASHINT
     assessments involve inspecting refuse containers and recycling bins for discarded critical
     information that could potentially be used by an adversary. This program will be used to
     establish a baseline analysis, to identify any OPSEC disclosures within 7 AF and
     subordinate units, and to verify compliance with the 100% shred policy.
        6.4.1.5.1. (Added-7AF) 7 AF units will conduct quarterly TRASHINT assessments
        to identify any information disclosures in accordance to the unit’s Critical
AFI10-701_7AFSUP_I 16 MAY 2014                                                                  35


          Information List. Attachment 6 contains the TRASHINT self-assessment checklist
          which will be used by all OPSEC PMs and Coordinators. All CIL related disclosures
          will be reported to the 7 AF OPSEC PMs at the end of each quarter.
      6.4.1.6. (Added-7AF) Assessment and survey observations/results will be included in
      the 7 AF annual consolidated OPSEC report, and briefed up the chain of command as
      applicable.
6.5. Web Content Vulnerability Analysis:
   6.5.1. Web content vulnerability analysis is a formal, structured        process of evaluating
   information posted on organizational public and private web             sites. This analysis
   complements each organization’s requirement to have processes            in place ensuring all
   information posted to publicly accessible web sites are reviewed        and approved prior to
   posting.
   6.5.2. Organizations will conduct web content vulnerability analysis of content on their
   organization’s public and private web sites for its sensitivity (i.e., critical information, For
   Official Use Only, or other controlled unclassified information categories) or sensitivity in
   aggregate to determine potential vulnerabilities by adversary exploitation. Prior to
   conducting a web content vulnerability analysis, follow these guidelines:
      6.5.2.1. Ensure a legal review is conducted by the Judge Advocate (JA) of your web
      vulnerability analysis processes prior to conducting assessments of information on your
      organizational public and private web sites.
      6.5.2.2. Ensure automated key word searching software (i.e. web crawlers) are approved
      for use by the local Systems Integration organization prior to utilization.
      6.5.2.3. If using automated software to retrieve information from web sites, ensure it is
      used only to assess the owning organizations public and private web sites.
      6.5.2.4. Develop strict procedures regarding who can conduct assessments, when the
      assessments will be conducted, what will be done with the information retrieved, who can
      view the information, and how long the information will be maintained on file.
      6.5.2.5. Manage and dispose of information collected and analyzed in accordance with
      AFMAN 33-363, Management and Records and The AF Records Disposition Schedule
      (AFRIMS).
6.6. Support Capabilities:
   6.6.1. Telecommunication Monitoring Assessment Program (TMAP) involves the collection
   and analysis of information transmitted via unsecured and unprotected communications
   systems (email, radio, telephone, and internet-based capabilities) to determine if these
   systems are being used to transmit critical, sensitive or classified information. TMAP helps
   in evaluating an organization’s OPSEC posture and determining the amounts and types of
   information available to adversary collection entities. TMAP is accomplished only within
   certain legal parameters and may only be performed by authorized personnel. See AFI 10-
   712, Telecommunication Monitoring Assessment Program (TMAP) for further guidance.
   6.6.2. Information Operations Mobile Training Teams (IO MTT) provide a three-phased
   event conducted by the 57th and 177th Information Aggressor Squadrons (57/177 IAS) where
36                                                      AFI10-701_7AFSUP_I 16 MAY 2014


  they assess an organization's network security, physical security, and counter-HUMINT
  capabilities. The first phase is executed remotely through dot-com capabilities and the
  collection and exploitation of open source information; the second phase is accomplished at
  the installation itself and finally through replication of the attack, the 57/177 IAS trains the
  information owners and base personnel on the threat to USAF critical information and their
  responsibilities of securing it. IO MTT identify operation vulnerabilities, operational
  impacts, and exercise threat response procedures. OPSEC PM/SMO/Coordinators use
  information identified by the IO MTT to conduct the OPSEC process.
  6.6.3. HUMINT Vulnerability Assessments (HVA) are used to assess the types and amount
  of information being exposed to potential HUMINT collection with respect to your missions.
     6.6.3.1. Results of these collection capabilities identify the possible level of exposure of
     critical information and operational indicators to adversary observation, surveillance, and
     intelligence sensors. Once analyzed, the information assists in the performance of risk
     assessments for blue forces to develop measures to counter the threat based on
     vulnerabilities identified.
  6.6.4. OSCAR is a web-based tool developed to provide a standardized process to assist the
  OPSEC community with assessing and quantifying risk to critical information allowing
  decision makers to make informed decisions on what countermeasures to implement to
  reduce the organization’s overall risk and vulnerabilities. OSCAR provides posture,
  vulnerabilities and risk level status, which can provide assistance in developing plans and
  management reports. It provides a platform for planners to test remediation options and
  scenarios and provides an expert knowledge base to assist in threat assessments. All OPSEC
  program managers are required to establish an OSCAR account. OSCAR accounts can be
  requested          by           going         to         the          following        link:
  https://register.dtic.smil.mil/wobin/WebObjects/RegLite?SiteID=OSCAR on SIPR.
  6.6.5. Organizations will request support through their SMO or OPSEC PM to their
  respective MAJCOM OPSEC PM. MAJCOM OPSEC PMs will submit TMAP requests to
  624 OC/CPD at 624OC/CPD@lackland.af.smil.mil; IO MTT request are submitted to HQ
  ACC/A3I at acc.xoz.iwd@langley.af.mil and HVA requests are submitted IAW procedures
  of your local AFOSI detachment.
     6.6.5.1. (Added-7AF) To request TMAP support for USAF units, commanders should
     contact the 7 AF OPSEC PM. The 7 AF OPSEC PM will send a request for monitoring
     message to HQ PACAF/A3TC, 624 OC/CPD, and 352 Network Warfare Squadron. If
     the request is for a real world contingency or joint exercise, PACOM will put the
     requirement into the joint operations planning and execution system (JOPES) and the
     requirement will be submitted to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and Joint Forces
     Command (JFCOM).
     6.6.5.2. (Added-7AF) Questions regarding telecommunications monitoring will be
     directed to the 7 AF OPSEC PMs at DSN 315-784-9788.

                 AIR FORCE OPSEC ANNUAL AWARDS PROGRAM

7.1. General:
   7.1.1. The annual Air Force OPSEC Awards program provides recognition of Air Force
   OPSEC professionals and is a priority for the Air Force OPSEC program. This awards
   program runs concurrently on a fiscal year basis with the National OPSEC Awards program
   conducted by the IOSS. Only AF OPSEC awards submitted by the Air Force OPSEC PM
   will be considered by the IOSS for the National OPSEC Awards.
   7.1.2. Air Force organizations wishing to compete for AF OPSEC annual awards must
   submit nominations through their respective MAJCOMs to reach AF/A3Z-CI, NLT 31 Oct
   each year.
   7.1.3. The Air Force does not award an AF-level award in the multimedia area. Any Air
   Force organization wishing to compete for the National OPSEC Multimedia Achievement
   Awards must submit nominations through their respective MAJCOM to reach AF/A3Z-CI,
   NLT 15 November to meet the IOSS suspense. Go to http://www.ioss.gov for further
   descriptions of the awards and nomination criteria.

                                           Chapter 8

                    OPSEC REQUIREMENTS WITHIN CONTRACTS

8.1. General:
   8.1.1. Contractors for defense systems acquisition programs as well as other types of Air
   Force contracts will practice OPSEC to protect critical information for specific government
   contracts and subcontracts.
   8.1.2. It is the responsibility of the organization to determine what measures are essential to
   protect critical and sensitive information for specified contracts. Organizations should
   identify OPSEC measures in their requirements documents and ensure they are identified in
   resulting solicitations and contracts. The organization is responsible for ensuring the
   appropriate critical program information; OPSEC measures and costs are billed and tracked
   as a separate line item in all contracts.
8.2. Guidance and procedures:
   8.2.1. Organizations will consider OPSEC for all contractual requirements. They must first
   determine whether there is any form of critical or sensitive information or activities involved
   in the contract. It is the organization’s responsibility to inform the contracting officer when a
   determination has been made that there are no OPSEC requirements for the contract.
   8.2.2. If there are OPSEC requirements, the organization is responsible for conducting an
   OPSEC review of the Statement of Work (SOW) or Performance Work Statement (PWS)
   prior to the time the contracting officer publicizes the SOW or PWS. The SOW/PWS is a
   publicly released document that can reveal critical information or indicators of critical
   information. It is critical that the organization OPSEC PM or SMO identify OPSEC
   requirements in the scope of work.
   8.2.3. The organization will specify OPSEC requirements for classified contracts on DD
   Form 254, Department of Defense Contract Security Classification Specification. This form
   defines classification, regarding, downgrading, declassification, and OPSEC specifications
   for a contract. Though the DD Form 254 applies to classified contracts, and classified
   subcontracts, it may also be used for unclassified contracts to specify OPSEC requirements.
   For unclassified contracts, if the DD Form 254 is not used, the organization will define the
   specific OPSEC requirements in the contract and the SOW/PWS.
   8.2.4. The organization’s designated representative is responsible for preparation of the
   prime contract’s DD Form 254. Based on the classification guidance or OPSEC
   requirements in the prime contract, the prime contractor is responsible for preparation of DD
   Forms 254 for any subcontracts. This should be done in coordination with the organization’s
   SMO or OPSEC PM and security manager.
   8.2.5. The organization will state OPSEC requirements on DD Form 254, contracts and
   SOW/PWSs with sufficient detail to ensure complete contractor understanding of the exact
   OPSEC provisions or measures required by the organization. If the OPSEC block is checked
   on the DD Form 254, the organization shall:
40                                                   AFI10-701_7AFSUP_I 16 MAY 2014


     8.2.5.1. Task the contractor to develop an OPSEC program plan to address how the
     contractor plans to protect critical and sensitive contracted information, and upon
     organization acceptance, implement the OPSEC program plan.
     8.2.5.2. Provide OPSEC guidance for the contractors to use in developing their own
     OPSEC plan.
  8.2.6. The organization will determine OPSEC requirements when the contract involves
  sensitive information. When it does, the organization will ensure that the contract and
  SOW/PWS include OPSEC requirements, which must include establishing an OPSEC
  training program to protect the organization’s critical information.
  8.2.7. For a contractor to effectively comply with OPSEC provisions of the contract, the
  organization must provide the following guidance:
     8.2.7.1. Organization’s critical information.
     8.2.7.2. Adversaries’ collection threat information as it applies to the organization’s
     mission and the contract.
     8.2.7.3. Operations security guidance (at a minimum, the organization will provide a
     copy of this instruction).
     8.2.7.4. Specific OPSEC measures the organization requires (as appropriate).

                                    Chapter 9 (Added-7AF)

                                CRITICAL INFORMATION

9.1. (Added-7AF) Critical Information Defined:
   9.1.1. (Added-7AF) Critical information is specific facts about friendly intentions,
   capabilities, and activities vitally needed by adversaries for them to plan and act effectively,
   so as to guarantee failure or unacceptable consequences for friendly mission
   accomplishment. OPSEC indicators are friendly detectable actions and open-source
   information. An adversary may either obtain critical information as a whole or derive critical
   information by linking together seemingly unrelated elements of information that can be
   collected, interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive and/or exploit CI.
   9.1.2. (Added-7AF) The product of the first step in the OPSEC process is the development
   of a critical information list (CIL). Critical information is best identified by the individuals
   responsible for the planning and execution of the unit’s mission.
   9.1.3. (Added-7AF) Once a CIL is developed, commanders must approve the list and then
   ensure their critical information is protected and/or controlled. Note: Critical information
   and OPSEC indicators will be identified at the earliest stages of planning an operation or
   activity and be continuously updated as necessary to support mission effectiveness.
   9.1.4. (Added-7AF) Premature revelation of critical information may prevent or complicate
   mission accomplishment, reduce mission effectiveness, or cause loss of lives or damage to
   friendly resources. Some common types of critical information are included in Attachment
   4.
   9.1.5. (Added-7AF) Each wing/organization has a unique mission and the CIL must be
   tailored to that mission. Note: All wing/organization CILs will follow the basic format in
   Attachment 4.
9.2. (Added-7AF) Develop Organization Critical Information Lists:
   9.2.1. (Added-7AF) To develop the CIL, the wing OPSEC PM must assemble all of the
   wing's organization CILs, categorize the listings into main categories, then combine,
   summarize, and water down. Organization CILs should roll up into the wing CIL.
   9.2.2. (Added-7AF) OPSEC coordinators below wing- level must solicit inputs SMEs in all
   divisions within their organization in the development of the organization CIL.
   9.2.3. (Added-7AF) Once all five steps of the OPSEC process are complete, the
   commander will approve/sign his respective organization’s CIL.
   9.2.4. (Added-7AF) The CIL will be disseminated to every member in the organization.
   9.2.5. (Added-7AF) The CIL will also be forwarded to the 7 AF OPSEC PMs.
   9.2.6. (Added-7AF) The CIL is a dynamic document that will need to be revised to reflect
   changing circumstances and operations. OPSEC PMs and Coordinators will review their
   CIL annually or as necessary for adequate security and submit updated copies to 7 AF
   OPSEC PMs.

the direct effect level, MOEs answer such questions as, “was the intended direct effect of the
mission e.g., target destruction, degradation (to a defined point), or delay (for a given time)
created?” At the indirect level, they may answer things like, “has the enemy IADS been
degraded sufficiently to allow unimpeded air operations above 15,000 feet?” (AFDD 2)
Measures of Performance (MOP)—Objective or quantitative measures assigned to the actions
and against which the action’s accomplishment, in operations or mission terms, is assessed.
MOPs answer questions like, “were the weapons released as intended on the planned target?”
(AFDD 2)
Operations Security (OPSEC)—OPSEC is a process of identifying, analyzing and controlling
critical information indicating friendly actions associated with military operations and other
activities to: Identify those actions that can be observed by adversary intelligence systems;
Determine what specific indications could be collected, analyzed and interpreted to derive
critical information in time to be useful to adversaries; Select and execute measures that
eliminate or reduce to an acceptable level the vulnerabilities of friendly actions to adversary
exploitation.
OPSEC Assessment— An evaluative process, conducted annually of an organization, operation,
activity, exercise, or support function to determine if sufficient protection measures are in place
to protect critical information. An OPSEC program review may include self-generated program
reviews, Inspector General inspections, or higher headquarters reviews that specifically address
OPSEC.
OPSEC Compromise—The disclosure of critical information or sensitive information which
has been identified by the information owner (commander/director) and any higher headquarters
that jeopardizes the unit’s ability to execute its mission or to adequately protect its personnel
and/or equipment. Critical or sensitive information that has been compromised and is available
in open sources and the public domain should not be highlighted or referenced publicly outside
of intra-governmental or authorized official communications because these actions provide
further unnecessary exposure of the compromised information.
OPSEC Coordinator—Acts as an interface to direct and manage all relevant OPSEC matters
below the wing-level and reports to the SMO or OPSEC PM.
OPSEC Indicator—Friendly detectable actions and open-source information that can be
interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive critical information.
OPSEC Measure—Methods and means to gain and maintain essential secrecy about critical
information.

above the squadron level that is not a wing. Ensures OPSEC requirements are in compliance as
directed and reviews organizational plans to ensure OPSEC is appropriately considered.
OPSEC Planner—An individual who has been formally trained in the planning and execution
of OPSEC.
OPSEC Survey— An OPSEC survey is the application of the OPSEC methodology by a team
of subject matter experts to conduct a detailed analysis of all activities associated with a specific
organization, operation, activity, exercise, or support function by employing the known
collection capabilities of potential adversaries.

OPSEC Vulnerability—A condition in which friendly actions provide OPSEC indicators that
may be obtained and accurately evaluated by an adversary in time to prove a basis for effective
adversary decision making.
Risk—A measure of the potential degree to which protected information is subject to loss
through adversary exploitation.
Risk Analysis—A method by which individual vulnerabilities are compared to perceived or
actual security threat scenarios in order to determine the likelihood of compromise of critical
information.
Risk Assessment—A process of evaluating the risks to information based on susceptibility to
intelligence collection and the anticipated severity of loss.
Sensitive Information— Unclassified information requiring special protection from disclosure
that could cause compromise or threat to our national security, an Air Force organization,
activity, military member, AF civilian, DoD contractor, or family member.
Signature—Observable activities and operational trends that reveal critical information to
adversary intelligence collection.
Signature Management (SM)—the active defense or exploitation of operational profiles
resident at a given military installation. Defense of operational profiles is accomplished by
implementing protective SM measures to deny adversary collection of critical information.
Exploitation of operational profiles is accomplished by using Deception in Support of OPSEC
(DISO) to protect critical information.
Signature Management Officer/Noncommissioned Officer (SMO/SMNCO)— Focal point
for all SM related matters at the wing or installation level. Ensures tactical level OPSEC and
MILDEC requirements are in compliance as directed and reviews wing or installation level plans
to ensure OPSEC and MILDEC are appropriately considered to actively defend or exploit
operational profiles resident at a given military installation.

detrimental to the success of program activities or operations.
Threat Assessment—an evaluation of the intelligence collection threat to a program activity,
system, or operation.
Vulnerability Analysis—In information operations, a systematic examination of an information
system or product to determine the adequacy of security measures, identify security deficiencies,
provide data from which to predict the effectiveness of proposed security measures, and confirm
the adequacy of such measures after implementation. See also information operations,
information system, security, and vulnerability.
Vulnerability Assessment—A process that examines a friendly operation or activity from the
point of view of an adversary, seeking ways in which the adversary might determine critical
information in time to disrupt or defeat the operation or activity.
Web Vulnerability Analysis—Process of evaluating information intended for release outside
the control of the organization, including release to the public, i.e., public and private web sites.
