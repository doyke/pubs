1.1. Aircrew Responsibility. In conjunction with other governing directives, this regulation
prescribes procedures for B-52 aircraft under most circumstances, but it is not a substitute for
sound judgment or common sense. Operations or procedures not specifically addressed may be
accomplished if they enhance safe, effective mission accomplishment.
1.2. Deviations. Deviations from these procedures require specific approval by the
MAJCOM/A3 unless an urgent requirement or an aircraft emergency dictates otherwise, in
which case the pilot in command, or instructor, will take the appropriate action to safely recover
the aircraft.
1.3. References. The primary references for B-52 operations are T.O. 1B-52H-1, T.O. 1B-52H-

                                    MISSION PLANNING

2.1. Flight Manuals. Flight Surgeons and flying Crew Chiefs not issued flight manuals are
personally responsible for maintaining adequate knowledge of emergency procedures. Refer to
AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manuals Program, for guidance regarding aircrew maintenance of
required flight manuals.
2.2. Checklists. Each crewmember will have and refer to appropriate flight manual checklists
during all ground and flight operations to ensure accomplishment of prescribed actions. When
accomplishing boldface items or Critical Action Procedures (CAPs) from memory during an
actual emergency, verbatim responses are not required; however, the steps must be accomplished
in order and perform the directed actions of the checklist per the flight manual. Conditions
permitting, complete remaining non-boldface items by reference to the flight manual checklist.
2.3. Local Aircrew Aids. Develop locally produced aircrew aids. As a minimum, include the
following:
   2.3.1. Briefing guides.
   2.3.2. Weight and balance data for calculating local aircraft configurations.
   2.3.3. Local radio channelization and airfield diagrams.
   2.3.4. Impoundment and radio out procedures.
   2.3.5. Recovery procedures with weapons onboard, jettison areas, and hot brake
   areas/procedures.
   2.3.6. Divert/alternate and emergency airfield information including runway data,
   approximate course/distance/estimated time enroute (ETE)/altitude, coordinates, and fuel
   required.
   2.3.7. Other information as deemed necessary by individual units, for example, stereo flight
   plans, turnaround procedures, local training areas, instrument preflight, and maintenance
   brevity codes.
2.4. Mission Planning Responsibility. Individual aircrews, unit operations, and intelligence
functions jointly share responsibility for mission planning. Aircraft commanders are ultimately
responsible for ensuring all mission planning materials are current and command guidance is
followed.
2.5. Mission Planning Procedures. Accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe
mission accomplishment for all phases of flight. As a minimum, mission planning includes
takeoff data, a winded flight plan, en route procedures, planned simulated/actual threats, target
study/weapons delivery, air refueling, fuel requirements (amount and type), chart preparation for
all crew positions, applicable Special Instructions (SPINS) and landing data. In addition, for
night sorties planned with Night Vision Goggles (NVGs), review lunar illumination and
elevation, anticipated ground light sources, and weather for the planned low level period.
Prepare crew mission folders in accordance with AFGSCI 10-450 Vol 2, Operations Nuclear

Committed Aircraft Nuclear Planning, and MCR 55-125, Preparation Of Mission Planning
Materials.
     2.5.1. (Does not apply to AFRC) Planning/Preparation Requirements:
        2.5.1.1. Units will maintain mission planning facilities where all information and
        materials required for flight planning are available. Maintain appropriate weather
        information and climatological data for flight planning. Aircraft modification status
        boards must be readily accessible.
        2.5.1.2. Unit staff will provide flight crews sufficient time to accomplish crew mission
        planning and mission briefing. This period is normally 8 hours, but may be reduced in
        proportion to the planned sortie complexity and amount of staff and computer prepared
        mission data available to the crew. However, in no case will less than 2 hours be
        allocated to allow the crew to review mission data and complete an aircrew mission
        briefing. Mission planning must be accomplished as a crew. Unit staff will ensure other
        activities, such as recurring academic training, training device periods, additional duties,
        etc., do not interfere with time allotted for mission planning and aircrew mission briefing.
        The aircraft commander/flight lead/mission lead/mission commander is ultimately
        responsible for the proper conduct of mission planning and must ensure sufficient time
        and materials are available to effectively plan the sortie.
        2.5.1.3. If unable to comply with the mission planning requirements of this chapter due
        to weather divert, the mission will not include low level. However, the crew may fly the
        same low level as the original mission if re-briefed and flown within 72 hours of the
        original brief.
        2.5.1.4. Make crew substitutions with sufficient time for the substitute crewmember(s) to
        comply with paragraph 2.5.1.2. Substitutions require squadron TOP-3 or higher
        approval.
     2.5.2. (Does not apply to AFRC) Crew Mission Planning:
        2.5.2.1. All crewmembers must be present during mission planning unless specifically
        excused by the squadron operations officer or higher authority. The aircraft commander
        will direct detailed mission flight planning, including tactics, techniques, and procedures
        to employ. Review all crew and crewmember training requirements/currency and
        schedule outstanding items to the maximum extent possible. Review aircrew and aircraft
        restrictions for each activity planned. Plan an alternate mission/activity including activity
        in the event equipment failure or weather prevents accomplishing the primary mission.
        2.5.2.2. The aircraft commander/flight lead/mission lead/mission commander is
        ultimately responsible for the accuracy and completeness of all mission data. The aircraft
        commander must ensure crew substitutions are made in time for the substitute
        crewmember(s) to be thoroughly briefed and familiar with the applicable mission data.
     2.5.3. Target Study.
        2.5.3.1. Target study familiarizes the crew with ingress/egress routing, en route threat
        locations and applicable tactics, detailed description of the target area, and procedures for
        weapon employment. Target study must be accomplished as an integral crew and under
        supervision of a unit designated Target Study Officer (TSO). Prior to giving target study,
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                      9


     TSOs must: certify IAW local procedures outlined in Chapter 8 and have current
     information on the routes and targets to be briefed. Tactics and threat review portions
     should be supervised by weapons and tactics and intelligence personnel, as available.
     Units may document completion of target study on AF Form 4037, OAS
     Briefing/Debriefing Analysis and Review. Target study by a qualified TSO is required
     for all actual weapons releases and exercises. All other simulated weapons activity will
     follow local Chapter 8 procedures for target study requirements.
     2.5.3.2. Route Study (Low Altitude Only):
        2.5.3.2.1. Crewmembers will review procedures for descent to low altitude, route
        altitude structure (Terrain Avoidance (TA) and Instrument Flight Rules (IFR)),
        navigator/pilot information blocks, obstructions, noise sensitive/avoidance areas,
        altimeter changeover points, special operating procedures/notes, low level abort
        procedures, and applicable CHUMs. Plan routing around any man-made obstacles at
        or above the planned flight altitude. They will also review conflicting low altitude
        route/airway crossing areas and all airports within or near low level route corridor.
        When scheduled through open Electronic Scoring Sites (ESS), crews should fax
        information to the applicable site.
        2.5.3.2.2. The TSO will brief the primary and alternate TA calibration peak/area
        procedures, significant terrain, possible terrain masking opportunities for briefed
        threats, any changes for the last 30 days (noise complaints/avoidance areas, CHUMs,
        new operating procedures, etc.), and minimum safe altitude for the route. The TSO
        will also discuss location, description, acquisition ranges, and optimal tuning of en
        route fixpoints for equipment updates prior to the Initial Point (IP) of the bomb run.
     2.5.3.3. Weapons Employment:
        2.5.3.3.1. For the bomb run review, the TSO will place particular emphasis on
        identifying overall radar and visual patterns/pointer systems to aimpoints, optimum
        tuning techniques, IP, the target, and Bomb Release Line (BRL). Review the target
        description and radar/visual predictions of the target and/or aimpoints for more
        precise crosshair placement, especially if area terrain may cause radar return breakup
        and visually obscure the target. Also, provide visual timing points and photos (if
        available) to assist the pilot team during the run.
        2.5.3.3.2. The TSO will discuss equipment characteristics/limitations/procedures,
        weapon impact intervals, stop release, train length, number and type weapons to be
        released. The TSO will also brief weapon release parameters including airspeed,
        altitude, and axis of attack, timing tolerance/frag deconfliction, and primary,
        alternate, and emergency bombing procedures. In addition, cover weapon preflight
        procedures, fuse settings, probability of damage required, altitude calibration points,
        and other pertinent data from the bomb form.
     2.5.3.4. Tactics and Threat Study. Unit weapons and tactics and intelligence personnel
     will develop realistic threat scenarios for specific sortie profiles/low level routes the unit
     will fly each quarter. Brief threat location, type, and capabilities during target study.
     Crews will develop an Emissions Control (EMCON) plan (coordinated within the
     formation, as applicable) based on the threat scenario. Also, review applicable tactics to
10                                 AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


     defeat/degrade the threat while still effecting reliable weapon delivery. These scenarios
     should be changed often to maximize training.
  2.5.4. Aircrew Mission Briefing. The aircraft commander will conduct an aircrew mission
  briefing for all missions. A crewmember excused from the briefing, or substituted following
  the briefing, must receive appropriate target study and a detailed briefing by the aircraft
  commander covering all requirements of paragraph 2.5.4.1. below.
     2.5.4.1. The briefing includes all scheduled activities and required items in Attachment
     2 in order of accomplishment from takeoff through mission termination. Units may
     augment this guide as necessary. The aircraft commander must brief recovery base and
     planned alternate location, radio aids, approach lighting, runway markings and lights.
     Review procedures and crew coordination required to identify runway environment and
     transition from instrument to visual landing cues. Brief the descent, approach, and
     landing phase in sufficient detail that only a short review is required inflight during the
     pre-descent phase. Brief alternate mission activity.
  2.5.5. Formation Briefing. The formation leader will conduct a briefing for all
  crewmembers in the formation covering the planned activities, procedures, techniques,
  specific EMCON procedures, and division of formation responsibilities. If planning lead
  changes, each formation lead should brief their portion of the mission. Formation briefing
  guides are in Attachment 2 and units may augment these guides as necessary. Units flying
  missions not covered by this regulation or its supplements (for example, Operational Test and
  Evaluation (OT&E) weapons delivery profiles) will develop and maintain briefing guides for
  those missions as applicable. As a minimum, the briefing must include all applicable items
  listed in the guide. The formation leader must ensure all crewmembers in the formation
  thoroughly understand their responsibilities, to include assumption of formation leadership.
  Resolve any questions during the briefing. If aircraft depart from separate bases and
  rendezvous for formation activity, the formation leader will conduct a telephone briefing.
  2.5.6. Pretakeoff Meeting. The aircraft commander/flight lead/mission commander will
  conduct a pretakeoff meeting in accordance with the procedures defined in the local Chapter
  8 to this regulation. The aircraft commander/flight lead/mission commander will review with
  the crew any changes to the mission to ensure complete knowledge of all scheduled activity
  including changes to the arrival and approach procedures for the first destination. All
  crewmembers should attend the weather briefing. The aircraft commander is responsible for
  updating the crew on significant weather conditions and will review the impact on the
  mission with the crew.
     2.5.6.1. If the interval from initial aircrew briefing to takeoff exceeds 72 hours, the
     aircraft commander/flight lead/mission commander must personally rebrief the entire
     flight mission again with the aircrew. This does not apply to off duty station training
     missions where the crew has planned and briefed to fly several missions in a 3-4 day
     period. For missions of this type, the crew will review the planned route to be flown
     during the pretakeoff meeting prior to each individual mission.
     2.5.6.2. The aircraft commander's signature on the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan,
     indicates all the items in the briefing guides were briefed/accomplished. Units filing
     electronically must designate alternative procedures in their local Chapter 8 for
     documenting briefing requirements.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                   11


   2.5.7. Chart Preparation:
       2.5.7.1. Prepare charts IAW T.O. 1B-52H-1 Section 4 and MCR 55-125. Refer to
       AFGSCI 10-450 Vol 2 for nuclear sorties.
       2.5.7.2. Pilots, radar navigators, and navigators must use low level charts constructed on
       Tactical Pilotage Charts (TPC). Areas not covered by TPCs may be constructed on
       Operational Navigation Charts (ONC) or a suitable NIMA-approved replacement.
       Electronic Warfare Officers will be provided, as a minimum, a chart with expected
       threats, terrain features, and turn points.
       2.5.7.3. For training purposes, use unclassified ranges for all simulated surface-to-air
       missile rings. If unavailable, use simulated surface-to-air missile, early warning/
       controlled intercept site, and fighter intercept radius rings in 5 nautical mile (NM)
       increments (5 NM, 10 NM, 15 NM, etc.)
       2.5.7.4. Obtain JN/ON charts to cover 200 NM either side of course and alternate bases.
       2.5.7.5. When manually creating low level charts, update charts from the Chart Update
       Manual (CHUM) and annotate all noise sensitive areas along the route of flight. If using
       up-to-date flight planning software (PFPS), CHUM is automatically updated.
2.6. Fuel Conservation. Unit supervision/aircrew will manage aviation fuel as a limited
commodity and precious resource. Fuel efficiency will be considered throughout all phases of
mission planning and execution. Unit supervision/aircrew will design flight plans and routing
for optimal fuel use. In-flight procedures such as climb/descent profiles and power settings will
also be examined for efficient fuel usage.

                                            Chapter 3

                          NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

3.1. Air Refueling. Air to air refueling operations are authorized on an IFR flight plan and
along published or special tracks/anchors. In addition, under certain circumstances, en route
refueling may be conducted between aircraft comprising a formation. During these operations, it
is the primary responsibility of the tanker aircrew to remain within the protected lateral,
longitudinal, and vertical airspace. For the dimensions of protected airspace and other
conditions/procedures affecting air refueling operations, refer to Federal Aviation Administration
Handbook (FAAH) 7610.4, Special Military Operations, Chapter 10.
   3.1.1. Fly anchor air refueling tracks, or tracks that require frequent turns, in a trail position
   stacked up 500 feet above base refueling altitude rather than echelon formation. When the
   lead bomber has completed air refueling, initially assume a left echelon position and descend
   to 1,500 feet below AR altitude. This will allow the lead bomber to transition to a 2-NM trail
   formation position for turns and provide 1,000 feet for a breakaway bomber to descend. If
   the completed bomber continues to stack down in trail position, they should be ready to
   deconflict with a breakaway bomber. The lead bomber should consider leaving the
   formation once their air refueling is complete if mission objectives permit. This will free up
   airspace and greatly reduce lead‘s workload.
   3.1.2. Military Assumes Responsibility for Separation of Aircraft (MARSA):
       3.1.2.1. MARSA between the tanker(s) and the receiver(s) begins when the lead tanker
       advises Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) they accept MARSA.
       3.1.2.2. After MARSA has been declared, controller assigned course or altitude changes
       prior to rendezvous completion will automatically void MARSA. Once rendezvous is
       completed, headings and altitude assignments may be made with tanker concurrence and
       MARSA can remain in effect.
       3.1.2.3. After rendezvous, the tanker will keep receiver(s) within 3 miles of the tanker
       until MARSA is terminated.
   3.1.3. Rendezvous:
       3.1.3.1. Rendezvous Delta (Point Parallel). Receiver aircraft shall arrive at the
       Rendezvous Control Point (RVCP) no earlier than the scheduled Rendezvous Control
       Time (RVCT) minus 5 minutes and depart no later than RVCT plus 10 minutes. If
       unable to meet timing tolerance, attempt to contact a unit scheduler/duty officer for a new
       rendezvous time. If unable to schedule a new rendezvous time, air refueling is permitted
       provided ARTCC clearance is received.
       3.1.3.2. Rendezvous Golf (Enroute, also buddy and on course). Aircraft should arrive
       at the Rendezvous Point ± 5 minutes of the scheduled rendezvous time. If unable to meet
       timing tolerance, attempt to contact a unit scheduler/duty officer for a new rendezvous
       time. If unable to schedule a new rendezvous time, air refueling is permitted provided
       ARTCC clearance is received. Note: Aircrews must be aware arriving outside the +5/-
       10 minute window for point parallel rendezvous or the ± 5 minute window for enroute
       rendezvous may result in a conflict with other aircraft scheduled in the refueling airspace.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                     13


       If a conflict arises between two formations, the formation within their timing tolerance
       will take precedence.
   3.1.4. Visual Formation. Visual formation during air refueling is authorized IAW ATP-56
   (B). Refer to T.O. 1B-52H-1 Section 2 for applicable procedures (referred to as observation
   position.)
3.2. Cruise.
   3.2.1. Authentication Procedures. Crews will authenticate all directed mission changes,
   when applicable.
   3.2.2. Sorties that remain within UHF contact of local command post are exempt from
   Emergency Action Message (EAM) and HF requirements.
   3.2.3. BRNAV procedures and information.
       3.2.3.1. Basic Area Navigation (BRNAV) Airspace. Airspace where BRNAV is applied
       is considered special qualification airspace. Both the operator and the specific aircraft
       type must be approved for operations in these areas. BRNAV navigation accuracy
       criteria is RNP-5. The B-52 complies with RNP-5 accuracy, integrity, and continuity and
       is approved for BRNAV operations requiring RNP-5 or higher criteria. Aircrew must
       update position as required to maintain actual centerline within +/- 5 NM of ATC cleared
       route.
          3.2.3.1.1. Minimum equipment to operate in BRNAV airspace is one INU capable of
          updates from Doppler and/or Radar inputs (i.e., not tied to aircraft GPS). Flights
          entering BRNAV airspace after long over water flight must be especially aware of
          BRNAV tolerances and update accordingly. Note: The B-52 GPS receiver is not
          certified for BRNAV operations.
          3.2.3.1.2. Minimum aircrew for BRNAV operations is a pilot, copilot, and radar
          navigator.
          3.2.3.1.3. Aircraft must turn short of filed points to remain within +/- 5 NM of ATC
          cleared route. Aircrew should utilize the ―Turn Short‖ feature when preparing
          mission data cartridges and during inflight operations.
          3.2.3.1.4. Aircraft unable to maintain BRNAV tolerances must advise ATC
          immediately and take appropriate coordinated action.
          3.2.3.1.5. Document (in the aircraft forms) malfunctions or failures of BRNAV
          required equipment, including the failure of this equipment to meet BRNAV
          tolerances.
3.3. Low Altitude Training. Conduct low altitude training in specifically approved mission
employment areas. Mission employment areas are defined in Attachment 1.
   3.3.1. Communications:
       3.3.1.1. Prior to entering an IFR Military Training Route (IR), confirm with ARTCC the
       entry and exit fix time, the requested altitude after exiting, and if applicable, the number
       of reentries.
14                                AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


     3.3.1.2. Refer to Flight Information Publication (FLIP) AP/1B, Area Planning - Military
     Training Routes, for communications procedures on VFR Routes (VRs).
     3.3.1.3. During low level, monitor Flight Service Station (FSS) for Significant
     Meteorological Information (SIGMET) and Airmen Meteorological Information
     (AIRMET) advisories at all times except at reporting/monitoring points, on the bomb run,
     when in contact with ARTCC, or when inflight emergencies dictate otherwise.
     3.3.1.4. Communications Failure on an IR Route. For most routes, FLIP AP/1B
     contains the communications failure altitude. This is the altitude to fly after route exit.
     When flying a route without a published communications failure altitude, file the
     communications failure altitude in the remarks section of the DD Form 175. Confirm
     this altitude with the controlling ARTCC prior to route entry.
  3.3.2. Weather Requirements:
     3.3.2.1. Prior to entering any mission employment area, crews will attempt contact with
     a Pilot to Metro Service (PMSV) station (or appropriate weather source) designated
     during the weather briefing. This contact should be as near to the area entry time as
     possible to ensure receipt of the latest significant weather information. Without updated
     in-flight weather information from any source, the decision to enter will be based on crew
     judgment, considering such factors as forecast weather, altimeter settings and "D" values,
     and observed weather. Note: The requirement to obtain updated weather information in
     flight may be waived at the aircrew's option for missions where low altitude training is
     within 1½ hours after takeoff.
     3.3.2.2. Use all available information to evaluate the possibility of encountering
     mountain wave effects. If it appears mountain wave effects could be encountered, climb
     to Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) or IFR altitude early enough to avoid the effects. If
     mountain wave effects are encountered at any altitude, abort the area.
     3.3.2.3. Aircrews are prohibited from entering a mission employment area closed due to
     hazardous weather/flight conditions (thunderstorms, turbulence, large number of birds or
     numerous birdstrikes, etc.). Aircrew will abort the low level when notified of route
     closure if they have not passed the area of hazardous weather or flight conditions. If the
     aircrew is advised the route is closed after passing through the area of hazardous weather,
     the decision to continue or abort rests with the crew. Aircrews aborting a mission
     employment area due to hazardous weather or flight conditions will advise the home
     station WG/CP and provide a Pilot Report (PIREP) to the home weather unit.
     3.3.2.4. Icing. Do not conduct low altitude flights in areas of forecast severe icing
     conditions or areas of reported moderate or severe icing conditions. If moderate or
     severe icing is encountered, abort the mission employment area.
     3.3.2.5. Turbulence. Do not conduct low altitude flight in areas of forecast severe
     turbulence, forecast moderate or severe turbulence in mountain wave effect, or moderate
     or severe turbulence reported by military aircraft. If type aircraft (military or civilian)
     reporting moderate turbulence is unknown, contact appropriate ARTCC for advisory. If
     moderate or severe turbulence is encountered, abort the mission employment area.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                  15


     3.3.2.6. Wind Restrictions. B-52 flight at TA contour altitude is prohibited in
     mountainous areas when winds at MSA/IFR altitude are 40 knots or greater. During TA
     operations, if winds exceed 40 knots in a mountainous area, climb to MSA/IFR altitude.
     When approaching a mountainous terrain area with winds over 40 knots, climb to
     MSA/IFR altitude early. TA flight is permissible with winds over 40 knots in a non-
     mountainous area provided AFI 11-202V3 General Flight Rules, ―Wind and Sea State
     Restrictions for Ejection Seat Aircraft‖ are met. Use all available information (e.g., wind
     readouts, drift information, blowing dust, turbulence, cloud formations, etc.) to evaluate
     the possibility of encountering mountain wave effects. If it appears mountain wave
     effects could be encountered, climb to MSA/IFR altitude early enough to avoid the
     effects. If mountain wave effects are encountered at MSA/ IFR (i.e., lenticular clouds
     with high winds), abort the route.
     3.3.2.7. Visibility/Cloud Clearance Requirements. Weather for TA operations on IR
     routes must be at or better than TA Visual Conditions. If TA Visual Conditions cannot
     be maintained, climb to MSA/IFR altitude as soon as practical prior to encountering IFR
     conditions. Weather conditions for operations on VR routes must be IAW FLIP AP/1B.
     If these weather conditions cannot be met, abort the route. For night operations, weather
     must meet the applicable day criteria. In addition, sufficient light and visibility must
     exist to recognize major changes in terrain elevations such as mountain peaks, ridge lines,
     valleys, and sloping terrain (NVGs may be used to satisfy visibility requirement).
  3.3.3. Negative Altitude Variations. Aircrews will use altitude variations from PMSV (or
  compute using PMSV altimeter settings and D values) to determine which route segments are
  affected by excessive altitude variations. This information should be obtained as close as
  possible to the planned entry time. Crews unable to contact a PMSV station may enter using
  information from the preflight weather briefing.
     3.3.3.1. If any of the following situations occur during Instrument Meteorological
     Conditions (IMC) or at night and the crew is unable to clear terrain visually, abort the
     route (NVGs may be used to clear terrain visually during night Visual Meteorological
     Conditions (VMC)):
         3.3.3.1.1. The difference between aircraft pressure altitude as indicated with the most
         current altimeter setting and the Offensive Avionics System (OAS)/Absolute Altitude
         (HA) computed true altitude exceeds -400 feet. This can be measured directly by
         taking an altitude calibration (for example, a 2420 Mean Sea Level (MSL) pressure
         altimeter reading and a 2000 ft OAS/ HA value would yield a -420 ft altitude
         variation).
         3.3.3.1.2. The aircraft radar altimeter indicates less than a 600 ft terrain crossing
         while at the MSA/IFR altitude.
         3.3.3.1.3. Flying and maintaining TA clearance plane settings and the aircraft
         pressure altimeters indicate at or above the route IFR/MSA altitude.
     3.3.3.2. When only the entry point area is forecast with excessive altitude variation, the
     crew may enter the route even with IMC conditions at the entry point. However, the
     crew cannot descend below 1000 feet above the IFR/MSA altitude for the Primary TA
     Initiation Point (PTAIP) unless VMC is encountered and can be maintained.
16                                AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


     3.3.3.3. When latter portions of the low level route are forecast with excessive altitude
     variation and the entry point is within prescribed tolerances, crews may enter the route in
     IMC conditions and fly MSA/IFR altitude up to the area of excessive altitude variation.
     Prior to entering the area of excessive altitude variation, crews must be able to visually
     clear terrain in order to continue low level operations. Once the forecast/observed area(s)
     of excessive altitude variation is overflown, subsequent portions of the low level route
     may be flown. Note: Altitude variation tolerances are amended as shown for the
     following route segments:
        3.3.3.3.1. IR-800, points F to T: -600.
        3.3.3.3.2. IR-800, points AL to AX and AX to AS for racetrack routing: -600 feet.
        3.3.3.3.3. IR-801, points A to AL: Unlimited.
  3.3.4. Equipment Restrictions. If equipment problems impair the crew's ability to clear
  terrain do not attempt low level flight.
     3.3.4.1. Flight Controls. Abort low level if any flight control system malfunction
     denies the pilot a safe margin of control over the aircraft.
     3.3.4.2. Mapping Radar Failure (Scope Blank or Inadequate for Navigation). Do
     not fly low level, during day IMC or night, with mapping radar failure. Aircraft without
     mapping radar may penetrate to low altitude during daylight hours provided TA Visual
     Conditions can be maintained. Crews may fly visual contour flight with mapping radar
     failure. Abort the route if weather conditions fall below TA Visual Conditions at any
     time.
     3.3.4.3. OAS Processors. Do not fly low level with less than one processor during night
     or in IMC. Crews may penetrate to low level and fly the route as long as day TA Visual
     Conditions can be maintained.
     3.3.4.4. Multi-Function Displays (MFDs). Do not fly low level unless there is at least
     one operable MFD at the RN station and one at the navigator's station.
     3.3.4.5. Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS). Do not fly low level with a
     malfunctioning AHRS. Exception: The AHRS does not need to be fully operational if
     one Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) is providing accurate heading and there is accurate
     MD-1 gyro stabilization for the pilot's attitude director indicator (ADI) (this exception
     applies only for day, VMC low altitude training).
     3.3.4.6. Radar Altimeter. TA or EVS/visual contour flight without a properly operating
     radar altimeter is prohibited.
     3.3.4.7. Additional Night Equipment Restrictions. The following equipment must be
     fully operational for night TA operations, with or without NVGs:
        3.3.4.7.1. Terrain avoidance system.
        3.3.4.7.2. Doppler/INS. Either Doppler or INS ground speed and drift information
        may be used.
        3.3.4.7.3. EVS. Either Steerable TV (STV) or Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR)
        must be operational for night TA operations.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                    17


        3.3.4.7.4. Do not fly night TA if the aircraft performance is degraded; for example,
        engine out or main gear extended.
     3.3.4.8. Do not practice radar silent operations in IMC or at night.
  3.3.5. TA Procedures:
     3.3.5.1. Crewmembers must use all means available to clear terrain, including EVS
     equipment. Sound crew judgment must be used to determine whether current conditions
     warrant TA flight. If there is any doubt, the crew should climb to IFR altitude
     immediately.
     3.3.5.2. Descent from IFR altitude must be accomplished in TA Visual Conditions. The
     PTAIP, or Start TA Point, is not a mandatory start descent point. The OAS radar will be
     in full scan TA (Plan Position Indicator (PPI) display or Displaced Center Plan Position
     Indicator (DCPPI) display) for all descents to TA altitudes. Range marks will be
     displayed to the maximum extent possible (N/A day Visual Flight Rules (VFR)).
     3.3.5.3. TA flying under a cloud deck can be extremely hazardous, particularly under
     conditions of rising terrain or decreasing ceiling. In this case, climb immediately to
     MSA/IFR altitude.
     3.3.5.4. Visual contour flying is not authorized at night.
     3.3.5.5. During TA or visual contour operations, aircrews are encouraged to deviate from
     centerline, within route corridor, for tactics training. Attempt to maintain route centerline
     when flying at IFR altitudes without visual terrain clearance. Crews are not authorized to
     deviate from published route corridor except when aborting the route. Note: If a conflict
     arises between the pilot's and navigator's information, climb to a safe altitude and resolve
     it; obtain further flight clearance if necessary. If differences are resolved resume
     scheduled training activity.
     3.3.5.6. If aircraft position is unknown, immediately climb to MSA/IFR altitude. If
     position cannot be determined after climbing to MSA/IFR altitude or any time route
     corridor has been exceeded, abort the route.
     3.3.5.7. Whenever bank angle exceeds 15°, the pilot flying the aircraft will make the turn
     visually or, if at night, initiate a climb to a safe altitude before executing the turn.
     3.3.5.8. If the TA operational check is not completed by 30 NM prior to the Start
     Maneuver Area (SMA)/IP, discontinue the check and prepare for the bomb run. If either
     the Fuselage Reference Line (FRL) or Flight Vector Reference (FVR) compensation has
     been completed, TA procedures may be used. If not, revert to EVS/visual contour,
     conditions permitting, or the MSA/IFR altitude. This does not preclude system
     evaluation of a previous check within the 30 NM restriction.
     3.3.5.9. Combat Altimeter Setting. During day TA operations aircrews are encouraged
     to determine, set and maintain true altitude in the aircraft pressure altimeters. Enter the
     route using the latest ARTCC/FSS altimeter, then determine an altimeter setting after
     passing the Start TA point. Reset aircraft pressure altimeters using current FSS
     information before entering IMC flight conditions or before any climb to IFR altitude.
 18                                  AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


       3.3.5.10. Crews may omit the circled items of the Descent, After Descent, and TA
       Compensation checklist when weather conditions or time constraints prevent
       accomplishment of the comparison/ FRL compensation. During night mountainous
       conditions, crews will accomplish the entire checklist unless the TA set has been
       previously compensated.
       3.3.5.11. Conduct low altitude ESS activity on a scheduled basis only. Unscheduled low
       altitude runs are prohibited. Unscheduled high altitude activity may be conducted
       provided such activity does not interfere with scheduled activity. Aircrews may request
       scoring racetrack (backside) activity when flying a scheduled re-entry.
       3.3.5.12. Monitor ESS transmissions for Electronic Attack (EA) restrictions and question
       the site immediately if you do not understand the instructions. Do not jam signals in
       restricted bands. All threat signals will be considered when determining crew tactics.
       Practice realistic tactical scenarios throughout the EA/bomb run to the maximum extent
       possible.
   3.3.6. IR Route Timing Tolerances. Crews will use the timing tolerances as specified in
   FLIP AP/1B. In the absence of specified requirements, aircrew will enter only at scheduled
   time plus or minus five minutes. If the scheduled entry cannot be made within the above
   tolerance, the use of subsequent primary or alternate entry points/times is authorized
   provided the aircrew has been so briefed and will maintain route timing.
   3.3.7. VR Route Procedures. All flights on VRs will be conducted IAW AFI 11-202V3. If
   FLIP AP/1B weather minimums cannot be maintained, the aircraft will abort the route.
   Aircraft will enter VRs only at designated route points. Aircraft will exit only at designated
   route points unless weather conditions or an emergency situation dictates otherwise.
   3.3.8. If ARTCC issues instructions that cause the aircraft to deviate outside the route width
   or altitude structure (IRs or VRs), the aircrew may continue the mission provided the
   following conditions are met:
       3.3.8.1. ARTCC controllers can assure positive radar surveillance until the aircraft is
       established back in the route structure.
       3.3.8.2. Mission timing tolerance can be met at the next low level navigation point.
   3.3.9. Abort Procedures. Crews aborting low level, will obtain clearance from ARTCC
   prior to departing the low level unless a safety of flight condition (turbulence, thunderstorms,
   equipment malfunctions, etc.) exists which necessitates an immediate climb or turn. If
   aborting without a clearance, climb to a safe altitude on a course which will avoid airways
   and Class A, B, C, and D controlled airspace to the maximum extent possible. In addition,
   aircrew aborting without a clearance will place the Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) to
   emergency setting, report the emergency and flight plan deviation as soon as possible and
   obtain a new clearance. Note: FAR 91.123 states that no pilot may deviate from an ARTCC
   clearance, except in an emergency unless he or she obtains an amended clearance.
3.4. NVG Procedures. NVGs enhance the capability to fly low level. Crews will fly the TA
trace and use their normal instrument cross-check to maintain prescribed altitudes. High level,
NVGs assist the pilots with threat identification (ID) and avoidance, as well as formation station
keeping. Do not use NVGs for air refueling or pattern operations.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                      19


  3.4.1. TA Visual Conditions are required when conducting low level operations with NVGs.
  This will ensure adequate illumination for proper NVG operation. If conditions of reduced
  visibility are encountered while wearing NVGs, use extreme caution as weather phenomena
  (e.g., fog, clouds, etc.) are difficult to perceive with NVGs until after penetrating the weather.
  3.4.2. Individuals are cleared for NVG training after a successful flight physical according to
  their AFSC IAW AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards.
  3.4.3. Optimum operation with NVGs requires at least one-quarter moon at 30 degrees or
  higher elevation. NVG training may be conducted under less than optimum conditions, but
  normal night weather and visibility restrictions still apply for low altitude operations.
  3.4.4. Determine in advance specific crew duties and procedures for aircraft emergencies,
  inadvertent weather penetration, and the threat environment. Plan and brief details such as
  who will fly the aircraft, who will transition from NVGs, who will perform emergency
  actions, what maneuvers will be flown, cockpit lighting, etc.
  3.4.5. Each crewmember whose duties require the use of NVGs will adjust and calibrate
  their respective NVG device on an approved NVG calibration lane or NVG tester prior to
  use.
  3.4.6. Generally, all crewmembers requiring NVGs should be on or off goggles at the same
  time. Items such as terrain or weather which are obvious to a pilot on NVGs may not be
  visible to a non-NVG pilot. These differences in visual capabilities can cause problems in
  communicating information within the cockpit. For the same reasons, mixing different types
  of NVGs (AN/AVS-9 with AN/AVS-6, AN/AVS-6 with AN/PVS-5, etc.) within the cockpit
  is not recommended.
  3.4.7. The aircraft commander will ensure sufficient operable sets are aboard the aircraft.
  Each crewmember whose duties require using NVGs will be current and qualified with the
  NVG, unless accompanied by a current and qualified instructor.
  3.4.8. If possible, begin donning the NVG and associated equipment approximately 45
  minutes prior to descent to low level or 45 minutes prior to the threat area for high altitude
  missions. During low level missions, terminate NVG operations when the mission dictates
  and adjust cockpit lighting to a suitable level to allow for safe instrument flight.
  3.4.9. The pilot flying the aircraft will use TA procedures, radar altimeter, and visual inputs
  gained from the NVG to maintain the proper terrain clearance. NVGs will not be used for
  visual contour low level or visual formation.
  3.4.10. If NVGs fail and sufficient lighting is not available, climb to a safe altitude. Resume
  NVG/ TA operation only if sufficient light becomes available.
  3.4.11. If any doubt exists concerning terrain clearance or visibility, immediately climb to a
  MSA/ IFR.
  3.4.12. Cockpit Lighting. AFTTP 3-3.B52 will be used as the baseline for proper NVG
  cockpit setup. Units may supplement this information. Approved lighting systems include
  the indigenous NVG cockpit lighting (C+ modification), cyalume light sticks, and an
  approved battery powered LED light bar. Always carry cyalume lights sticks as a backup as
  they remain the most reliable means of cockpit lighting. In no case will NVGs be used
  without one of the cockpit lighting systems mentioned above.
 20                                 AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


3.5. Formation:
   3.5.1. Concept. Maintain formations to provide mutual support provided it does not unduly
   interfere with mission accomplishment.
   3.5.2. Safety. Formation is a potentially hazardous operation. Strict compliance with the
   specified procedures is essential to the safe conduct of any mission. These procedures,
   however, cannot substitute for proper aircrew judgment during fluid formation operations.
   3.5.3. Definitions:
      3.5.3.1. Formation Flight. Formation flight by FAA definition is more than one aircraft
      which, by prior arrangement between the aircrews, operate as a single aircraft with regard
      to navigation and position reporting. Separation between aircraft within the formation is
      the responsibility of the flight leader and the crewmembers of other aircraft in the flight.
      This includes transition periods when aircraft within the formation are maneuvering to
      attain separation from each other to effect individual control and during join-up and
      breakaway. For descriptions of authorized B-52 formations, refer to AFTTP 3-3.B52.
      3.5.3.2. Standard Formation. One in which each wingman maintains a proximity of no
      more than 1 mile laterally or longitudinally and within 100 feet vertically from the flight
      leader.
      3.5.3.3. Nonstandard Formation. Those operating under any of the following
      conditions (B-52s typically fly this type formation):
          3.5.3.3.1. When the flight leader has requested and ARTCC has approved other than
          standard formation dimensions.
          3.5.3.3.2. When operating within an authorized altitude reservation (ALTRV) or
          under the provisions of a letter of agreement.
          3.5.3.3.3. When operations are conducted in airspace specifically designed for
          special activity.
          3.5.3.3.4. The formation leader shall notify ARTCC upon initial contact that the
          formation operations are being conducted in a nonstandard formation, and if required,
          advise ARTCC of the separation and spacing being employed (FAAH 7610.4).
      3.5.3.4. Formation Departure. A formation departure is the departure of multiple
      aircraft at intervals of 1 minute or less which, by prior arrangement between the aircrews,
      operate as a single aircraft with regard to navigation and position reporting. The
      departure portion of the flight may terminate at a preplanned breakup point, which may
      be located up to, but not beyond, the planned initial level off at cruise altitude. Formation
      requirements of para 3.5.3.1 apply.
      3.5.3.5. Enroute Formation. An en route formation is two or more aircraft with the
      same intended route of flight, maintaining station-keeping operations by either visual
      and/or electronic means. Formation flight requirements of para 3.5.3.1 apply.
          3.5.3.5.1. When flying nonstandard formation, advise ARTCC of the longitudinal,
          lateral, and/or vertical separation between flight lead and the last aircraft in formation
          so they can provide appropriate separation from other aircraft.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                  21


         3.5.3.5.2. Should separation between the flight leader and any other aircraft in the
         formation exceed ARTCC separation limitations or vary significantly from that
         reported to ARTCC for the nonstandard formation, the aircraft outside the formation
         limits will no longer be considered part of the formation. The pilot will inform the
         leader of his or her position and request ARTCC provide individual control until
         reestablished in formation.
     3.5.3.6. Stream Formation. A stream formation flight is defined as two or more aircraft
     (or flights of aircraft) operating along the same intended route of flight as individual
     aircraft with regard to navigation and position reporting. Separation between consecutive
     aircraft or flights should not be less than 30 seconds nor more than 3 minutes
     longitudinally and 3,000 feet vertically. Stream formation, as flown by B-52s, is
     "nonstandard" by FAA definition.
  3.5.4. Responsibilities.
     3.5.4.1. Flight Lead. Only aircraft commanders who are certified to be flight lead IAW
     AFI 11-2B-52V1, B-52--Aircrew Training, may be flight lead, unless under IP
     supervision. The IP may supervise an uncertified aircraft commander from a wingman
     position. This does not prohibit an uncertified wingman from temporarily assuming
     flight lead duties for training or tactical considerations (i.e., equipment malfunctions).
         3.5.4.1.1. The qualified flight lead is ultimately responsible for safe and effective
         mission accomplishment, regardless of their position in the formation in flight.
         3.5.4.1.2. Flight lead will brief all aspects of the mission per AFTTP 3-3.B-52 and
         ensure all flight members have a clear understanding of the mission prior to flight.
     3.5.4.2. Wingmen. Wingmen will execute flight lead‘s plan and adhere to the briefed
     standards. Additionally, they will assist as required to enhance flight lead‘s situational
     awareness with any information that may impact flight lead‘s decision making, and they
     will be prepared to take the lead and execute flight lead‘s plan, when directed.
     3.5.4.3. Units. Units will adhere to formation standards defined in AFTTP 3-3.B-52,
     and may supplement formation standards using chapter 8 to this instruction based on
     mission requirements. Units will designate the most qualified aircraft commanders as
     flight leads for operational missions.
  3.5.5. Call Signs. To preclude confusion by ARTCC, if aircraft positions within a flight are
  changed, do not change the flight call sign or IFF squawk. However, change the position
  numbers within the flight to the ones assumed.
  3.5.6. EMCON. Practice EMCON to the maximum extent possible during peacetime in
  preparation for combat operations. Do not sacrifice safety in an effort to adhere to EMCON
  procedures. Refer to AFTTP 3-1.B-52, AFI 11-214, Air Operations Rules and Procedures,
  T.O. 1-B-52H-1, or ATP-56(B) for EMCON levels.
  3.5.7. Formation Takeoff. Takeoff interval is no less than 30 seconds for conventional and
  nuclear operations. For ―Buddy‖ refueling formation departures, the receivers usually roll
  first, followed by the tankers in that element. Takeoff intervals or sequence may be varied as
  necessary depending on aircraft acceleration and performance, training requirements,
22                                  AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


  weather, airfield conditions, and mission requirements. Make an abort call anytime the
  takeoff is aborted.
     3.5.7.1. Do not conduct Quick Taxi/EWO Departure Exercises (as defined in AFI 11-2B-
     52 V1) with nuclear weapons loaded aboard the aircraft or with aircraft gross weights in
     excess of 450,000 pounds.
     3.5.7.2. Quick Taxi/EWO Departure Taxi Procedures. Units will establish taxi plans
     from the normal parking area to each runway. Follow the taxi sequence established in the
     formation briefing (or free flow if briefed), to ensure proper launch sequence. Flight lead
     will confirm takeoff data computations, accomplish guard receiver check, and copy
     ARTCC clearance in the chocks. When possible, crews should start engines, taxi, and
     launch without interruption. If for any reason takeoff clearance is canceled after the
     aircraft are rolling, aircraft short of the runway will not cross the hold-short line.
     Following aircraft will set or adjust power as necessary to maintain proper spacing and a
     safe speed during taxi and alignment for takeoff roll.
  3.5.8. Departure:
     3.5.8.1. Fly formation departures according to unit developed formation routing,
     published instrument departure procedures, and the provisions of any existing letters of
     agreement between the local unit and ARTCC facilities. During departure and climb, use
     all available means (radar, EW receivers, visual and radios) to maintain safe aircraft
     separation and effect join-up. If safe separation cannot be established by visual, radar or
     radio contact, accomplish lost wingman or locally developed abort procedures. Carefully
     monitor altitude separation during rejoin. During IMC or when visual contact is lost,
     each aircraft in the flight will make periodic altitude calls, a minimum of every 5,000
     feet, to ensure safe separation. Maintain formation integrity during any cutoff
     maneuvering (i.e. number three will close on number two, etc.). Subsequent closing
     aircraft (numbers three, four, five, etc.) will monitor lead's relative position. Lead must
     monitor the formation using all available means during departure/join-up and be prepared
     to assist wingmen having trouble locating lead.
     3.5.8.2. Formation Closure/Join-up. Aircrews must safely apply procedures in AFTTP
     3-3.B-52 when accomplishing formation closure and join-up procedures through constant
     awareness of closure rate approaching formation position.
  3.5.9. Aborts. Aborting aircraft will clear the planned launch stream and take appropriate
  actions dictated by the reason for abort. Advise flight lead of abort. Flight lead should
  attempt to assist the aborting aircraft in any way possible. If the mission allows, flight lead
  may designate an escort. Aborting aircraft will obtain ARTCC clearance prior to altering
  their route or declare an emergency and deviate as necessary, whichever is appropriate.
  3.5.10. Level Off. Flight lead must initially maintain a briefed airspeed to level off to allow
  formation closure. Adjust to cruise airspeed at briefed action point. B-52 aircraft normally
  fly non-standard formation. For non-standard formations, obtain an altitude block for all
  intermediate and final level off altitudes (normally a 1,000 foot altitude block for a formation
  of three aircraft). Block altitudes must provide a minimum of 500 feet altitude separation
  between aircraft in non-standard formation. Upon reaching an intermediate level off altitude,
  aircraft should "stack down" at 500 foot intervals and close to en route formation spacing.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                     23


  All aircraft will normally stack up at final level off. Direction of stacking will be as required
  by mission tactics and as briefed by flight lead. If ARTCC will not approve a block altitude,
  request IFR separation or hard IFR altitudes for each aircraft in formation. Note: The
  technique of maintaining 250 feet above or below a single altitude assigned to two aircraft in
  formation is a direct violation of FAR part 91.175(a.). This technique is not acceptable and
  will not be practiced or used.
  3.5.11. Enroute Formation:
     3.5.11.1. AFTTP 3-3.B-52 describes authorized enroute formation positions. When
     visual conditions permit, minimize radio transmissions; heading and airspeed changes
     need not be announced.
     3.5.11.2. Airspeed and Altitude. Plan the mission to consider the airspeed requirements
     of the highest or heaviest aircraft, whichever is more restrictive.
  3.5.12. Midmission Join-ups. A midmission join-up should provide a sufficient straight leg
  beyond the planned rendezvous point to effect join-up. Use the following generalized
  procedures for scheduled or unscheduled midmission join-ups.
     3.5.12.1. On Course. Arrive over a common navigational control point and then depart
     on a common leg. Flight lead should cross the rendezvous point, followed by the joining
     wingmen with at least 1,000 feet of altitude separation. As each aircraft crosses the
     rendezvous point, the aircrew may call airspeed, altitude, and heading over UHF
     interplane frequency, if deemed necessary. Once contact is established and verified,
     flight lead will clear the wingmen to close to en route formation and effect altitude
     changes as required. ARTCC radar assistance may be used, if necessary, to provide
     initial positioning.
     3.5.12.2. Point Parallel. Reference procedures outlined in ATP-56(B) (RV-D) and
     technical orders. Maintain a minimum of 1,000 feet altitude separation between
     aircraft/formations during the rendezvous.
  3.5.13. Position Changes. Changes in formation position may be required for the purpose
  of changing lead or moving wingmen with inoperative radar to a position where following
  aircraft can monitor their position. Prior to executing any position change, flight lead must
  ensure all formation members understand the procedures to be used. Cover position change
  procedures in the formation briefing.
     3.5.13.1. Altitude is the most critical element during position changes. Make altitude
     changes only when assured of lateral spacing, or when coordinated on interplane
     frequency.
     3.5.13.2. Once initiated, position changes take priority over all other activities. Prior to
     initiating a position change, flight lead will ensure sufficient straight and level time and
     airspace is available to complete the change. Maintain radar or visual contact throughout
     the position change. If radar and visual contact are lost during a position change,
     maintain altitude, advise flight lead that contact is lost, and attempt to reestablish contact
     by all available means. Do not attempt to rejoin the formation until establishing positive
     radar or visual contact. The last aircraft in formation with operable radar will monitor the
     position of other aircraft to ensure proper separation.
24                                AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


     3.5.13.3. Aircraft that have changed positions will assume the call sign of their new
     position and flight lead duties (if appropriate). The new flight lead will check the
     formation in and all aircraft will acknowledge with their new call sign. The new lead
     aircraft will use flight lead‘s call sign for ARTCC communication and assume the current
     mode-3 squawk for the formation, unless otherwise briefed or directed by the controlling
     agency.
     3.5.13.4. VMC. The following procedure is normally used to effect an aircraft lead or
     position change with other aircraft during VMC. Prebrief or coordinate on interplane
     frequency all changes in heading, position, and altitude.
        3.5.13.4.1. Wingmen will maintain a minimum 1/2 mile in trail and maintain 500 feet
        altitude separation. The aircraft to assume the lead will move laterally to the right
        approximately 1/2 mile. Use 15 degrees of bank to turn 15 degrees from heading then
        turn back to heading using 15 degrees of bank. The wingman will accelerate and pass
        flight lead on the right (maintain 1/2 mile lateral separation).
        3.5.13.4.2. As the wingman passes flight lead, flight lead will pass the lead to the
        wingman. The new flight lead will check the formation in, assume flight lead
        responsibilities, and climb or descend to base altitude after positive visual separation
        is confirmed.
        3.5.13.4.3. The new wingman (old flight lead) will obtain 500 feet altitude
        separation, place IFF to standby, notify the new flight lead when approaching position
        in trail, and confirm altitude. Then the new flight lead will decelerate to briefed
        airspeed.
        3.5.13.4.4. The wingmen will assume trail or tactical position behind flight lead and
        make a normal closure to proper position.
     3.5.13.5. IMC. Use the following procedure to effect a position change in IMC
     conditions. The following procedure is to move any aircraft to lead. However, the
     procedure can be modified to accomplish a change to the end of the formation. Use the
     same bank, heading and airspeed changes, but stabilize ¾ NM aft of the last aircraft when
     moving to the end of the formation, before returning to the trail position.
        3.5.13.5.1. Flight lead determines the maneuvering aircraft. The maneuvering
        aircraft will echelon (normally right) using 30° of bank and turning 30° from
        formation heading. When 30° off heading, reverse the turn and return to the
        formation heading. This should provide an approximate two nautical mile offset.
        3.5.13.5.2. After established in echelon, the maneuvering aircraft will accelerate
        approximately 15 KIAS (airspeed may be increased if required). The maneuvering
        aircraft should stabilize on formation airspeed at approximately 1¼ NM forward
        range from the original lead. After stabilizing in the forward echelon position and
        visual or electronic contact is established, flight lead will direct an altitude change
        then pass the lead to the wingman.
        3.5.13.5.3. The new flight lead will check the formation in and assume flight lead
        responsibilities, then move into the lead position using no more than a 15° heading
        change.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                     25


  3.5.14. Radar Failure. Flight lead will provide guidance if an aircraft experiences radar
  failure resulting in difficulty in navigation or maintaining position.
     3.5.14.1. During visual conditions, maintain formation position by visual/EVS means
     and notify flight lead if you anticipate instrument conditions.
     3.5.14.2. During instrument conditions, maintain position using trailing aircraft radar to
     assist in spacing. If conditions warrant, make a position change to put the aircraft with
     radar failure in front of an aircraft with operating radar. Position two is optimum for
     radar-out aircraft in a three-ship formation.
         3.5.14.2.1. If flight lead experiences radar failure they may maintain position, but
         pass responsibility for formation navigation to the number two aircraft.
         3.5.14.2.2. Upon notification from a wingman of radar failure, flight lead should
         immediately announce formation heading, airspeed, and altitude. Flight lead will
         maintain a stable platform on the announced heading, airspeed, and altitude until the
         situation is under control.
  3.5.15. Lost Wingman Procedures. Use these procedures when visual and radar contact
  are lost and positive separation cannot be assured. In any lost wingman situation, immediate
  separation of aircraft is essential to maintain safety. Upon losing sight of and radar contact
  with flight lead, or if unable to maintain formation due to disorientation, the wingman will
  simultaneously execute the applicable lost wingman procedure, transition to instruments, and
  notify flight lead. Use a bank angle equal to the number of degrees to turn to achieve
  separation. Smooth application of control inputs is imperative to minimize the effects of
  spatial disorientation. Any aircraft, which can maintain visual and/or radar contact with an
  aircraft executing a lost wingman maneuver, will remain in formation with that aircraft until
  otherwise directed by flight lead. When flight lead is notified by a lost wingman, they will
  take appropriate action as the situation dictates until assuring positive separation. Flight lead
  will establish a reference heading and altitude after initial separation is assured. During
  recovery, if the flight has a block altitude clearance, wingmen should establish appropriate
  altitude separation.
     3.5.15.1. Two-Aircraft Flights:
         3.5.15.1.1. In wings level flight (climbing, descending, or level) simultaneously
         transition to instruments, inform flight lead, turn 15 degrees away and maintain new
         heading for 15 seconds, then resume course. Return to formation or obtain separate
         clearance if required.
         3.5.15.1.2. On the outside of the turn, transition to instruments, roll to wings level,
         and inform flight lead. Continue straight ahead to ensure separation prior to resuming
         turn. Return to formation if able or obtain separate clearance as required.
         3.5.15.1.3. On the inside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments and
         maintain established bank angle, reduce airspeed by 10 KIAS to ensure clearance, and
         inform flight lead. Flight lead will simultaneously roll wings level, maintain
         airspeed, and acknowledge the wingman's call. If flight lead has acknowledged the
         lost wingman call and confirms lead aircraft is wings level, the wingman will, after 15
         seconds, roll wings level, establish 500 feet altitude separation, turn to lead's
26                                 AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


         referenced heading and attempt to acquire flight lead on radar. If flight lead does not
         acknowledge, the wingman will maintain established bank angle, establish 500 feet
         altitude separation and roll out on a new heading. Attempt to acquire flight lead on
         radar and form into enroute formation position. If radar contact cannot be
         reestablished, obtain separate clearance from the controlling agency.
     3.5.15.2. Three-Aircraft Flights. If only one aircraft in the flight is separated, the
     procedures listed above will provide safe separation. However, as it is impossible for
     number three to immediately ascertain if number two still has visual or radar contact with
     flight lead, it is imperative that number three's initial action be based on the assumption
     that number two is also separated. Number two will maintain position if in visual or
     radar contact. If number two goes lost wingman, follow the procedures outlined above;
     number three will follow the procedures listed below:
         3.5.15.2.1. In wings level flight (climbing, descending, or level) simultaneously
         transition to instruments, inform flight lead, turn 30 degrees away, maintain new
         heading for 30 seconds, then resume course. Adjust to formation or obtain separate
         clearance as required.
         3.5.15.2.2. On the outside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments,
         inform flight lead and reverse direction of turn for 15 seconds to ensure separation
         from flight lead and number two. Adjust to formation or obtain separate clearance as
         required.
         3.5.15.2.3. On the inside of the turn, simultaneously transition to instruments and
         maintain established bank angle, reduce airspeed by 20 KIAS to ensure clearance, and
         inform flight lead. Flight lead will simultaneously roll wings level, maintain airspeed
         and acknowledge the wingman's call. If flight lead acknowledges the lost wingman
         call and confirms wings level, establish 1,000 feet altitude separation, turn to flight
         lead's referenced heading, and attempt to acquire flight lead and number two on radar.
         If flight lead does not acknowledge loss of visual contact, maintain established bank
         angle, establish 1,000 feet altitude separation, roll out on new heading, attempt to
         acquire flight lead on radar, and form into en route formation position. If radar
         contact is not reestablished, obtain separate clearance from the controlling agency.
     3.5.15.3. All Aircraft. At night, after establishing positive separation, all aircraft will
     display anti-collision and position lights to aid in reestablishing contact, if applicable.
  3.5.16. Air Refueling/Echelon Formation:
     3.5.16.1. Adhere to echelon formation procedures as defined in T.O. 1B-52H-1 and
     ATP-56(B). Maintain proper echelon spacing and angle using radar and/or visual means.
     3.5.16.2. Turns greater than 30 degrees into the echelon are permitted only in an
     emergency. Turns into an echelon should not exceed 15 degrees of bank. All aircraft
     must execute the turn at the same time, or when time permits, start with the last aircraft,
     then the next to last aircraft, etc. If turns greater than 30 degrees are necessary for
     mission requirements, flight lead should direct all succeeding aircraft to trail formation.
  3.5.17. Low Level Formation. Weather, tactical considerations, and mission objectives will
  dictate the degree and type of electronic emission and the extent of radio communications.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                  27


  When conducting low altitude training (LOWAT), formations may fly fighting wing/wedge
  or trail formation under day/VMC conditions only. For other than day/VMC, and for low
  level stream formation at TA altitudes, adhere to spacing criteria below.
     3.5.17.1. Prior to Descent to Low Level. Normally obtain low level en route spacing,
     with ARTCC clearance, at high altitude prior to the entry point. The point to obtain
     spacing should be far enough from low level entry to ensure normal ARTCC notification
     and allow aircrews time to stabilize in position. Additionally, this point should be
     identified at the formation briefing. If not obtained prior to entry, spacing for the low
     level route may be acquired after all aircraft have entered the route structure by using
     airspeed differential or "S" turns within the corridor at the aircrew's discretion.
     3.5.17.2. Degraded Aircraft Performance Spacing. If any aircraft has degraded
     performance (gear down, air refueling door open, etc.) to the extent they cannot meet
     formation time tolerances, but can meet published SMA time tolerances, place that
     aircraft at the end of the formation before low level entry. There can be no more than one
     degraded aircraft per low level formation if you anticipate or encounter instrument
     conditions.
     3.5.17.3. Descent. Flight lead will discuss descent procedures, tactics, and airspeeds in
     the formation brief to ensure deconfliction.
     3.5.17.4. Low Level En route.
        3.5.17.4.1. Spacing. Maintain low level en route spacing by precise time control at
        each low level action point. Reference AFTTP 3-3.B-52 for specific procedures.
        3.5.17.4.2. Altitude. All aircraft should plan to fly the same altitude schedule (TA or
        MSA/IFR altitude) during low level formation operations. Flight lead will direct
        formation to climb to MSA/IFR altitude prior to entering instrument conditions.
        Note: Flight lead will inform all aircraft in the formation of any significant low level
        weather change prior to descent into the route. If the formation will transition from
        high altitude visual conditions to low level instrument conditions, all aircraft will
        ensure a means exists to ensure safe aircraft separation prior to descending. If in
        instrument conditions, all aircraft will level off and fly MSA/IFR altitudes and
        maintain briefed timing separation for spacing.
        3.5.17.4.3. Airspeed. Control airspeed to meet low level action points within briefed
        timing tolerances. Bomb run airspeeds will ensure TOTs and weapons release
        parameters are met.
        3.5.17.4.4. Navigation:
            3.5.17.4.4.1. If visual, maximize EMCON procedures. Each aircraft will fly
            autonomously and need not be in trail of preceding aircraft. Terrain masking
            ground track may be different for each aircraft within the formation. Each crew
            must be constantly aware of the position of all other aircraft in the formation.
            Maintain appropriate spacing.
            3.5.17.4.4.2. Before flight, flight lead must brief en route threats, tactical
            considerations, update points, terrain masking plan, EMCON procedures, and
            visual or instrument procedures. Note: If conducting tactical maneuver training
28                                 AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


             during en route navigation, it should take place in all aircraft. Turns of, or in
             excess of 90 degrees heading change offer the potential for spacing conflicts when
             flight lead masks to the outside of a turn point and following aircraft masks to the
             inside. All aircraft must work from the same tactical scenario. Additionally, all
             aircraft should maneuver in response to threat signal activity.
     3.5.17.5. Abort Procedures. Refer to paragraph 3.3.9 for additional procedures.
         3.5.17.5.1. Individual Aircraft. If an individual aircraft aborts during low level,
         immediately notify the formation and follow appropriate procedures. All aircraft in
         the formation will place radars and air-to-air TACAN to operate/on. The aborting
         aircraft will clear the formation and notify them of intentions. Aborting aircraft have
         priority over all other activity.
         3.5.17.5.2. Aborting as a Formation. If the entire formation must abort the low
         level route, follow appropriate procedures as defined in AFTTP 3-3.B-52.
         Additionally, all aircraft will immediately establish radio contact while placing
         appropriate radars and air-to-air TACAN to operate/on. Flight lead will direct
         altitude separation, headings, and airspeeds. Establish positive radar and/or visual
         contact before the formation performs any climbing maneuver other than to establish
         immediate altitude separation and maintain a safe terrain clearance. Establish abort
         routing, altitude, and procedures during the formation briefing.
         3.5.17.5.3. In instrument conditions, if an aircraft cannot assure positive separation
         from other aircraft or is unable to maintain formation, immediately initiate a climb
         out of the low level route and follow lost wingman procedures.
  3.5.18. Battle Damage Checks. When circumstances require, flight leads should direct a
  battle damage check after actual weapon deliveries and/or prior to return to base (RTB). Do
  not perform the check in night or IMC, and fly no closer than Route formation spacing per
  AFTTP 3-3.B-52. Crewmembers must be certified per AFI 11-2B-52V1.
  3.5.19. Mixed Formations. Although standard formation procedures normally apply during
  mixed formations, give consideration to performance differences between participating
  aircraft. Flight lead must know these differences and thoroughly prebrief all aspects of the
  formation.     Wingmen must ensure all formation members know the performance
  characteristics of their aircraft.
     3.5.19.1. Launch, Departure and Level Off. Flight lead must determine the optimum
     sequence for launch of mixed aircraft formations based on performance, weather, airfield
     conditions, wake turbulence, and mission requirements.             Normally, the fastest
     accelerating or highest climb speed aircraft should lead. For formations including KC-10
     or E-4s with other lighter aircraft, the lighter aircraft will normally launch first due to
     wake turbulence considerations. One-minute interval is the standard for formation
     takeoffs. If weather conditions preclude 1 minute departures, do not accomplish
     formation takeoffs. Plan an en route or point parallel rendezvous.
     3.5.19.2. Climbs and Descents. Due to performance differentials, exercise caution if
     climbs or descents are necessary with mixed formations. Thoroughly brief the procedure
     before flight.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                  29


       3.5.19.3. Cruise:
           3.5.19.3.1. Tradeoffs between optimum altitudes and airspeeds for aircraft type may
           be required to achieve maximum overall formation efficiency. Flight lead will
           determine and brief the best cruise parameters consistent with mission requirements.
           3.5.19.3.2. Wingman consideration is paramount during altitude or airspeed changes.
           Flight lead must consider the most performance limited aircraft when making these
           changes.
3.6. Postflight:
   3.6.1. Before landing, the aircraft commander will call the unit command post and request a
   combat intelligence branch representative debrief the aircrew immediately after landing
   whenever encountering hostile or suspected hostile activity during a mission. Air Force
   Reserve (AFRC) will contact an appropriate agency.
   3.6.2. Flight crews will attend the maintenance debrief and will conduct a crew and
   formation flight debrief in accordance with procedures defined in the local Chapter 8 of this
   instruction. Complete all appropriate post-mission paperwork and turn it in as required.
   Units must establish procedures to ensure this paperwork is distributed to the proper agency
   in a timely manner.
3.7. Tactics. Each crew will plan, brief, and execute a realistic and sound tactical profile on
every mission-oriented sortie.

                              INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES

4.1. Takeoff and Join-up. Formation departures for the B-52 will comply with the applicable
restrictions and instructions for a nonstandard formation as defined in FLIP. Flight lead will
ensure ARTCC assigns IFF squawks for wingmen prior to departure.
4.2. Navigation. The B-52 is approved to use inertial navigation system (INS) for enroute Area
Navigation (RNAV). RNAV approaches have not been adopted for use by the USAF and will
not be flown. A discussion of Area Navigation can be found in the Airman Information Manual
(AIM) and FLIP. Other navigation and instrument information can be found in FAAH 7110.65.
4.3. Simulated Instrument Flight. Use of vision restricting devices to simulate instrument
flight is prohibited.
4.4. Instrument Approaches. See paragraph 2.5.4.1 for approach review procedures. Refer
to T.O. 1B-52H-1 Section II, Instrument Approaches, for applicable approach categories.
4.5. Airborne Radar Directed Approach (ARDA). In an emergency, it is possible for the
navigator team to direct the pilot through a safe nonprecision approach. When aircrews request
to practice an ARDA, they must meet the following conditions:
   4.5.1. Use a Department of Defense (DOD) FLIP terminal approach procedure with a
   designated FAF. This does not restrict accomplishing an ARDA when cleared for a visual
   approach from the radar pattern provided VFR conditions can be maintained.
   4.5.2. Obtain an ARTCC clearance for the specific approach procedure selected.
   4.5.3. Advise the appropriate ARTCC facility that the ARDA will be flown along with the
   requested DOD FLIP terminal approach, if applicable.
   4.5.4. Request ground radar monitor and traffic advisory service.
   4.5.5. VMC weather conditions must prevail from the FAF to the MAP. ARDA under lower
   weather minimums is restricted to emergency conditions when no other type of approach is
   available.
   4.5.6. Terminate the ARDA and resume pilot navigation any time it becomes apparent to any
   crewmember that the aircraft will exceed the parameters established for terminal instrument
   procedures (TERPs) as defined in AFMAN 11-226, United States Standard for Terminal
   Instrument Procedures.

                            AIR EXPENDABLES EMPLOYMENT

5.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for B-52 expendable training activity. Also
reference AFI 11-214 and CJCSM 3212.02.
5.2. Flare Drop Activity:
   5.2.1. Conduct live flare drop activity only in authorized special use airspace contained in
   current FLIP planning documents and overwater firing areas.
   5.2.2. Do not drop flares if uncertain of aircraft position. If practical, survey the fallout areas
   visually and with radar before and during all flare drops.
   5.2.3. Safety Precautions:
       5.2.3.1. Do not power the flare ejector system until within the approved flare drop area.
       5.2.3.2. Flare activity will be suspended or terminated whenever the aircrew is unable to
       sufficiently ensure safe conduct of the activity.
   5.2.4. A right hand empty light on the ALE-20 control panel should illuminate when all flare
   stepper switches have been activated. This occurs when the flares are individually or fast
   train dispensed. It doesn't guarantee all flares have been expended. Therefore, do not
   accomplish low approaches or touch-and-go landings after making or attempting a flare drop.
   Touch-and-gos are authorized after munitions specialists confirm all flares were dispensed
   (none remaining). Do not attempt a taxi-back sortie with confirmed hung, retained, or
   misfired flares.
   5.2.5. In case of an inadvertent flare drop, take the following actions:
       5.2.5.1. Immediately safe the flare ejector system.
       5.2.5.2. Record time and geographic coordinates of the inadvertent release.
       5.2.5.3. Contact the applicable airspace controller and advise them of the incident,
       approximate location and estimated damage.
   5.2.6. Units will develop local procedures to handle hung/hot flare situations.

                                           Chapter 6

                     AIR-TO-GROUND WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT

6.1. References. AFI 11-214 contains air-to-surface procedures applicable to all aircraft. Also
reference the AFI 13-212V1, Weapons Ranges, applicable range supplement and AFJI 11-204,
Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Materials. The procedures contained
in this chapter specify additional procedures or restrictions applicable to B-52 operations.
   6.1.1. Direct questions concerning weapon ranges and restrictions to the local Squadron
   DOW/OSS-A5 or HQ AFGSC/A3TW if unable to find the OPR or responsible agency.
6.2. Responsibilities and Definitions:
   6.2.1. On OT&E sorties, specific portions of this chapter may be waived by instructions
   contained in the operations order, test plan, or implementation message which directs the test.
   6.2.2. Terms:
       6.2.2.1. Weapon. Any live, inert, or training munitions.
       6.2.2.2. Attempted Release:
          6.2.2.2.1. The bombing system issues a release pulse in either automatic or manual
          mode with all weapons in ―GO‖ or ―RDY‖ status and targeted (1553/1760), or all
          Gravity SMO switches are correctly positioned.
          6.2.2.2.2. When releasing 1553/1760 controlled weapons, the SMO determines if the
          weapon was successfully launched, was aborted, or is hung and displays either
          AWAY, ABORT or HUNG in normal video immediately following the location for
          that weapon on the bottom of the MFD display. When a weapon is successfully
          released, ―xy: AWAY‖ is displayed for 5 seconds at the bottom of the PRGM display
          xy = location/station. After 5 seconds the xy location/station displays ―X‖ or [Less
          AMI] ―D‖.
       6.2.2.3. Hung Weapon:
          6.2.2.3.1. A weapon that doesn't separate from the aircraft after an attempted release.
          This may occur as a result of a release system or release unit malfunction resulting in
          a partially released bomb or a released bomb lying on closed bomb bay doors. Note:
          This includes weapons released and separation not confirmed or release status
          unknown.
          6.2.2.3.2. ICSMS 1553/1760 controlled weapons can be determined hung by the
          OAS displays, ―HUNG‖ and Less [AMI] ―HG‖, will be displayed in reverse video on
          the FRMT-7 display. ―xy:HUNG‖ will be displayed as a master fault.
   6.2.2.4. Retained Weapon.
          6.2.2.4.1. Weapons on board the aircraft with no release attempt or after successfully
          releasing the intended number of weapons in a partial load. For example, an aircraft
          with nine MK-82s plans to drop three bombs on each of three targets. Due to weather
          it attacks only one target. The aircraft now has six retained weapons. Weapons not
          released due to procedural errors are considered retained.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                    33


          6.2.2.4.2. When attempting release of I553/1760 controlled weapons a weapon is
          considered retained provided OAS FRMT-7 ―xy:AWAY‖, ―xy:HUNG‖ or Less
          [AMI] ―HG‖ or ―xy: NO ABORT‖ are not present for the intended weapons.
       6.2.2.5. Unconfirmed Hung Weapon. A weapon that cannot be confirmed to be
       released either by RCO spot or OAS FRMT-7. Confirmation that the weapons were
       released via procedures in paragraph 6.5.8 will remove the unconfirmed hung weapon
       status.
6.3. Planning Guidance:
   6.3.1. When actual weapons (live or inert) are carried, adhere to the following guidance:
       6.3.1.1. A target study officer or designated equivalent will brief aircrew on proper
       procedures prior to any flight carrying weapons.
       6.3.1.2. Aircrews will comply with applicable flight manuals, range guides, and AFI 11-
       214.
       6.3.1.3. Aircraft will follow a route to the release area that minimizes overflight of
       heavily populated and congested areas.
   6.3.2. Releases may be performed only within a designated training range, approved
   weapons release area, or approved salvo area.
   6.3.3. For weapon deliveries above 5,000 feet AGL, B-52 aircrews will use the following
   procedures:
       6.3.3.1. Aircrews will confirm bomb aim point through a minimum of two radar-
       identifiable OAPs.
       6.3.3.2. Aircrews will not expend any ordnance if any doubt exists as to the accuracy of
       the aircraft‘s navigation system or intended target location.
       6.3.3.3. B-52 aircrews may drop weapons in IMC or through an undercast provided they
       comply with applicable restrictions in the range supplement.
       6.3.3.4. Adhere to theater and MPC SPINS for GPS FOM and OAS buffer restrictions.
6.4. Target Data Verification. All crewmembers will conduct a thorough and complete
verification of targeting data in flight for all weapons, both guided and unguided.
6.5. Inflight Procedures:
   6.5.1. Do not open bomb bay doors during flight with internal weapons on board other than
   for intentional release or jettison.
   6.5.2. While carrying weapons, do not conduct approach to stall, simulated engine loss
   procedures, touch-and-go landings, or other potentially hazardous activity. Carrying
   weapons does not preclude accomplishing fighter intercept exercises, air refueling, or
   transition excluding simulated engine loss procedures and touch-and-go landings.
   6.5.3. Accomplish "Weapons Preparation for Release" check over open water or sparsely
   populated areas when possible.
   6.5.4. Do not complete the release configuration check until the aircraft is within the
   designated bombing range.
34                                AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


  6.5.5. While carrying weapons configured for release (Release Configuration Check-
  Complete), do not conduct Fighter Intercept Exercises (FIEs) (unless planned as part of an
  exercise and conducted in range airspace), simulated bomb/AGM/GBU runs, transition, air
  refueling (unless required for mission completion), or other potentially hazardous activity.
  6.5.6. Internal Weapons Release Restrictions and Procedures:
     6.5.6.1. While carrying internal weapons (live or inert) do not simulate internal weapons
     release.
     6.5.6.2. If there are no external weapons, simulated external weapons releases may be
     accomplished with SMO simulations while in full ―sim‖ mode. The OAS will be re-
     loaded with a FERRY mission and the weapons being simulated will be a different SMO
     from the weapons actually being carried internally. There will be no SMO loaded for
     internal weapons.
  6.5.7. External Weapons Release Restrictions and Procedures:
     6.5.7.1. While carrying external weapons, live or inert, do not simulate external weapons
     release.
     6.5.7.2. If there are no internal weapons, simulated internal weapons releases may be
     accomplished with SMO simulations while in full ―sim‖ mode. The OAS will be re-
     loaded with a FERRY mission and the weapons being simulated will be a different SMO
     from the weapons actually being carried externally. There will be no SMO loaded for
     external weapons.
  6.5.8. Release Verification. Confirm weapons releases by one of the following means:
     6.5.8.1. Verified by the RCO, and light indications are consistent with RCO
     observations. The RCO must positively confirm the exact number of weapons
     programmed for release.
     6.5.8.2. For release of a single live weapon at night from low altitude, if the RCO is not
     available to confirm the weapon impact, trailing aircraft in the formation may serve to
     visually confirm weapon release.
     6.5.8.3. Targeting Pod video may be used to confirm weapon impacts by the aircrew or
     by another aircraft in the formation with the following restrictions:
         6.5.8.3.1. The targeting pod video must be recorded with in-flight playback
         capability.
         6.5.8.3.2. The aircrew or wingman must be able to see all weapon impacts for the
         exact number of weapons planned for release on the video.
         6.5.8.3.3. Weapons impacts verification by the aircrew or wingman is limited to a
         maximum of nine weapons.
         6.5.8.3.4. If unable to view the required number of weapon impacts, or there is any
         doubt as to the number of impacts on the targeting pod video, the weapons release is
         unverified.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                 35


     6.5.8.4. If unable to confirm impacts of all weapons programmed for release as outlined
     above, a visual check of the weapons must be accomplished to confirm weapons status
     prior to conducting any additional training.
         6.5.8.4.1. Internal weapons. A visual check of the bomb bay must be accomplished
         to confirm weapons status prior to conducting any additional training.
            6.5.8.4.1.1. Visual checks of the bomb bay may be accomplished by bomb bay
            cameras, if equipped.
            6.5.8.4.1.2. Any crewmember entering the bomb bay must be mission and
            weapons qualified and must avoid inadvertent contact with the release
            mechanisms.
            6.5.8.4.1.3. Crewmembers will not enter the bomb bay to release bombs or to
            perform maintenance on release equipment.
            6.5.8.4.1.4. Weapons remaining in the bomb bay after an attempted release are
            hung munitions. Aircrews will comply with procedures and restrictions in
            paragraph 6.5.10
         6.5.8.4.2. External weapons. A visual check of the pylons must be accomplished to
         confirm weapons status prior to conducting any additional training.
            6.5.8.4.2.1. Visual confirmation of the pylons by other aircraft in the formation
            may be accomplished when carrying 500 lbs class weapons or larger, day/VMC
            only. The other aircrew must be able to observe all pylon weapon stations and
            will report the exact number of weapons remaining on each pylon, if any.
            6.5.8.4.2.2. Targeting pod equipped aircraft may use the pod to visually confirm
            the status of the pylons on other aircraft in the formation. The laser mode will be
            set to TRAIN, no laser code will be set, and laser arming will not be selected.
            6.5.8.4.2.3. Visual confirmation of the pylons by the crew is authorized if the
            weapons attempted to be released were loaded externally in positions visible to
            the aircrew.
            6.5.8.4.2.4. Crews unable to get confirmation of weapon impacts from an RCO or
            trailing aircraft and are unable to visually verify the status of their external
            weapons will assume a hung weapons status and follow the procedures in
            paragraph 6.5.10
     6.5.8.5. After positive confirmation of release of all weapons, aircrews may conduct
     additional training without restriction provided no weapons remain on the aircraft.
  6.5.9. Retained Weapons Restrictions.
     6.5.9.1. Crews experiencing retained weapons due to contingencies other than release
     malfunctions may conduct training activity excluding approach to stall, simulated engine
     loss procedures, touch-and-go landings, or other potentially hazardous activity. Retained
     weapons do not preclude accomplishing fighter intercept exercises, air refueling or
     transition excluding simulated engine loss procedures and touch-and-go landings.
     Simulated bombing or missile activity may be conducted as restricted by paragraphs
     6.5.6, 6.5.7 and Table 6.1 for allowable weapons training.

       6.5.9.2. Observe the following safety precautions for continued activity with retained
       training weapons:
           6.5.9.2.1. Accomplish post release/abort checklist before conducting any subsequent
           training activity.
           6.5.9.2.2. No release system, indicator, or weapon bay door malfunction may exist.
       6.5.9.3. Aircrews with retained weapons will follow locally developed guidance for the
       safe recovery of the aircraft and de-arming procedures.
   6.5.10. Hung Weapons Restrictions.
       6.5.10.1. For weapons remaining on the aircraft after an attempted release, or if the
       external weapons status is not verified, the weapons will be treated as hung weapons.
       6.5.10.2. After an unsuccessful release attempt, contact the RCO for permission to
       release or jettison hung weapons in a suitable area. Follow RCO instructions and all
       warnings and cautions in the appropriate technical order.
       6.5.10.3. If a hung weapon cannot be jettisoned, or jettison is not verified, the crew will
       accomplish the post release/abort checklist and return directly to home station or other
       suitable landing base, avoiding over flight of populated areas. Air refueling may be
       conducted to ensure the safe recovery of the aircraft. No other training may be
       accomplished.
       6.5.10.4. Aircrews with hung weapons will follow locally developed guidance for the
       safe recovery of the aircraft and de-arming procedures.
6.6. Targeting Pod (TGP) Restrictions. Minimum altitude for use of the TGP is 1,000 ft AGL.

      7.9.5.4. Configuration change (e.g. flaps, gear, airbrakes, etc.)
7.10. Fuel Minimums:
   7.10.1. The fuel reserve requirements of AFI 11-202V3 apply except as outlined below:
      7.10.1.1. Plan missions to accomplish final landing with a minimum of 20,000 pounds.
      7.10.1.2. Plan the mission so the usable fuel over the alternate, if required, is a minimum
      of 24,000 pounds.
      7.10.1.3. Fuel reserves for conventional operations will be as designated in the
      operations order.
      7.10.1.4. The minimum fuel reserve for remote or island destination is 34,000 pounds. If
      weather conditions are such that an alternate airfield is required in accordance with AFI
      11-202V3, then minimum fuel reserve is 54,000 pounds. The definition of a remote or
      island airfield is contained in AFI 11-202V3AFGSCSUP.
   7.10.2. Certain safety of flight conditions such as emergencies, go-arounds, etc., may
   occasionally necessitate final landing with less fuel than specified above.
   7.10.3. Individual units may dictate more restrictive fuel minimums in their local Chapter 8.
7.11. Air Refueling Limitations and Restrictions:
   7.11.1. Instruction in air refueling procedures, excluding rendezvous, is prohibited when the
   receiver aircraft is loaded externally or internally with nuclear weapons.
   7.11.2. Do not attempt EMCON rendezvous or refueling training unless at least 1,000 feet
   vertical separation is assured between tanker and receiver. Do not close within 1,000 feet
   vertically of the tanker unless reliable radio communications are established except for actual
   nuclear operations, critical fuel shortage, as directed in governing operations orders, or
   during Emission Option 2, 3, or 4 training. Brief Emission Option 2, 3, or 4 procedures
   before flight.
   7.11.3. Do not accomplish air refueling during training missions when any of the following
   conditions exist:
      7.11.3.1. When encountering turbulence which, in the opinion of the pilot or boom
      operator, denies a safe margin of control of either aircraft or boom.
      7.11.3.2. When two or more engines are shut down or when any engine has been shut
      down due to fire or fire indication.
      7.11.3.3. When the tanker has less than all engines operating.
      7.11.3.4. When any flight control problems are suspected or encountered which, in the
      opinion of the receiver pilot, would deny a safe margin of control.
      7.11.3.5. When tanker aircraft is unable to retract landing gear.
      7.11.3.6. When the aircraft gross weight is less than 230,000 pounds or more than the
      maximum limits specified in the appropriate flight manual.

  7.11.4. Do not conduct air refueling after known losses of tanker disconnect capability
  (including tanker manual operation without tanker disconnect capability or manual boom
  latching) except as authorized below:
     7.11.4.1. During an emergency fuel situation.
     7.11.4.2. When necessary to complete the following missions: operational nuclear or
     conventional, ORI, Global Guardian, emergency evacuation, deployment, and
     redeployment.
     7.11.4.3. When conducting air refueling under any of the above conditions, limit contact
     time and number of contacts to that necessary to complete mission requirements.
  7.11.5. Reverse air refueling and manual boom latching procedures training must be under
  instructor pilot supervision. Brief procedures used between receiver pilots and boom
  operators during mission planning. Inflight coordination between receiver pilot and boom
  operator must include briefing items as required by applicable air refueling technical orders.
  Both tanker and receiver air refueling system must be fully operable.
  7.11.6. Do not accomplish breakaway training from the contact position or boom limit
  demonstration unless:
     7.11.6.1. The receiver signal system is in normal.
     7.11.6.2. The receiver and tanker have assured normal disconnect capability prior to
     initiating maneuver.
  7.11.7. For breakaway training, the tanker pilot and boom operator and the receiver pilot will
  coordinate the maneuver prior to inflight accomplishment. Inflight coordination must
  include when the maneuver will occur and who will give the command of execution.
  7.11.8. For boom envelope demonstrations, the receiver pilot and the boom operator will
  confirm normal disconnect capability and discuss the maneuver prior to accomplishment.
  Inflight coordination must include the receiver pilot informing the boom operator when
  commencing the demonstration, the limit to be demonstrated, and when terminating the
  demonstration.
  7.11.9. To strengthen the safety aspects of copilot air refueling training the following
  procedures apply:
     7.11.9.1. Accomplish receiver copilot refueling, autopilot on or off, only under the
     following conditions:
         7.11.9.1.1. Instructor pilot supervision or supervision by a mission ready pilot, who
         has been designated in writing by the squadron commander.
         7.11.9.1.2. The receiver pilot must inform and receive acknowledgment from the
         tanker pilot and boom operator.
     7.11.9.2. Accomplish tanker copilot refueling with the tanker autopilot off only under the
     following conditions:
         7.11.9.2.1. The tanker pilot must inform and receive acknowledgment from the
         receiver pilot.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                      41


           7.11.9.2.2. During this time the receiver must be flown by a qualified receiver pilot
           (N/A FTU).
7.12. Low Altitude Limitations. This paragraph establishes operational limitations for mission
employment area training activity. The low altitude environment defined by this regulation is at
or below 5,000 feet AGL/ASL.
   7.12.1. Crews will not fly lower than 1,000 AGL/ASL in mission employment areas during
   Low Altitude Training (LOWAT). Exception: Test aircrew may conduct low altitude
   training at TA altitudes consistent with unit requirements and IAW guidance in this
   instruction and other current directives.
   7.12.2. Low altitude weight restriction is 230,000 to 420,000 pounds. These restrictions
   apply whenever the aircraft is operated at or below 5,000 feet above ground level or during
   ocean surveillance/reconnaissance operations at or below 5,000 feet MSL. The minimum
   low altitude weight restriction does not apply to en route, cruise or traffic pattern operations.
   7.12.3. Use of the autopilot nonsteering modes, other than second station, is not
   recommended for low altitude operations. Do not use nonsteering modes of the autopilot
   below 1,000 feet AGL except for the stab modes comparison check.
   7.12.4. Bank angles during low level or operations below 1,000 feet AGL/ASL are limited to
   30 degrees maximum. Use steep turn guidance as applicable for higher altitudes.
   7.12.5. Minimum clearance plane settings (TA operations only). 300 feet day and 500
   feet night are the minimum settings authorized under prevailing conditions. Units will plan
   and train toward these minimum altitudes, but the actual altitude flown may be anywhere
   between the minimum TA altitude and the MSA. The determining factor will be crew
   judgment, based on evaluations of aircraft equipment, weather conditions, aircrew
   capabilities, proficiency, and fatigue.
       7.12.5.1. Basic Mission Capable (BMC) individuals must maintain appropriate low level
       currency or fly with an instructor of like specialty.
       7.12.5.2. Crewmembers will fly their first FLAG sorties, during an exercise, no lower
       than 500' AGL to allow training area familiarization and orientation.
       7.12.5.3. Minimum TA altitudes for MTRs in FLIP AP/1B and AP/3 and those altitudes
       published in the applicable clearance plane letter will take precedence if higher than the
       above listed altitudes.
       7.12.5.4. Aircrews using NVGs will fly the appropriate night clearance plane settings.
       7.12.5.5. Fly visual contour during day TA Visual Conditions only. The visual contour
       altitude will be no lower than the minimum day TA clearance plane setting or the
       minimum altitude for the route segment/area, whichever is higher. Man-made
       obstructions must be taken into account when determining the clearance plane and the
       altitude to be flown.
       7.12.5.6. Busy Luggage weapon tests may be conducted at test plan prescribed altitudes
       but no lower than 200 feet AGL. Non-instructor aircraft commanders and radar
       navigators will be briefed by squadron instructors on the characteristics of very low
       altitude flight and will fly at least one practice sortie with instructors of like specialty
 42                                  AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


       experienced in low altitude TA operations, stepping down to the altitude required for the
       test.
       7.12.5.7. Do not conduct low altitude bomb/EA runs against scoring sites at an altitude
       below the minimum tracking altitude for any target being attacked unless accomplishing
       a Defensive Action Bomb Run.
       7.12.5.8. Aircrews must be constantly aware of weather conditions. Crews that
       encounter IMC will immediately climb to MSA. Climb to MSA under visual conditions
       whenever possible.
7.13. Traffic Pattern Limitations:
   7.13.1. Use the following procedures for all landings.
       7.13.1.1. To safely land a large jet aircraft, all landings (IFR and VFR) should look the
       same. Fly a stabilized approach with a standard 2.5 to 3.0 degree glidepath which is
       compatible with standard ILS/Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI). Use a visual aim
       point of 1,000 feet down the runway corresponding with the "Fixed Distance Markers" on
       a precision runway.
       7.13.1.2. Plan to land (IFR and VFR) within the designated touchdown zone (TDZ).
       AFJMAN 11-226, US Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS), defines
       the TDZ as the first 3,000 feet of the landing runway beginning at the threshold.
       7.13.1.3. Plan normal landings (IFR and VFR) to touch down on centerline within the
       TDZ at a point not less than 1,000 feet beyond the threshold. For all landings, use a
       runway of sufficient width and length to permit a safe, full stop landing without the drag
       chute. The desired TDZ is 1,200 to 2,500 feet beyond the threshold. Make the actual
       touchdown at a point and speed which will permit a safe, full stop landing within the
       remaining runway. Initiate a go-around if this is not possible. Brief procedures to use in
       the event of an unplanned go-around before landing.
   7.13.2. Touch-and-go landings are authorized only under the following conditions:
       7.13.2.1. Flight manual restrictions and procedures apply.
       7.13.2.2. Use a runway of sufficient width and length to permit a safe, normal full stop
       landing without the drag chute. Make the actual touchdown in the designated TDZ of the
       runway at a point and speed which would enable a safe full stop landing on the remaining
       runway. Initiate a go-around if this is not possible.
       7.13.2.3. The Runway Condition Reading (RCR) must be 9 or higher for touch-and-go
       landings.
       7.13.2.4. The flight duty limitations of AFI 11-202V3 and MAJCOM supplement apply.
       7.13.2.5. Non-IP aircraft commanders are limited to a maximum of 4 degrees crosswind
       crab.
       7.13.2.6. Non-IP aircraft commanders require a minimum 1,000 feet ceiling and 3 miles
       visibility.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                   43


   7.13.3. Instructor pilots or aircraft commanders will brief, either inflight or during mission
   planning, the individual being supervised on the following items prior to supervising touch-
   and-go landings.
      7.13.3.1. Flight manual procedures.
      7.13.3.2. The importance of smooth power application and stabilizing power before
      advancing throttles.
      7.13.3.3. Compressor stalls, including proper preventive action, recognition, and
      corrective action.
      7.13.3.4. Emergency jettison of drag chute.
      7.13.3.5. Proper use of airbrakes and stabilizer trim.
      7.13.3.6. Instructor Pilot (IP) or Aircraft Commander (AC) taking control of aircraft
      when necessary.
      7.13.3.7. Unplanned go-around using all throttles.
   7.13.4. Do not practice landings with less than 100 percent flaps, except where noted.
   7.13.5. Normally, deploy the drag chute on all full stop landings. Should operational
   requirements dictate a full stop landing be made without a drag chute, comply with flight
   manual taxi back limitations.
   7.13.6. Do not perform taxi back landings on wet runways.
   7.13.7. Pilots may fly overhead VFR traffic patterns provided that they are certified on their
   unit Letter of Xs. When flying overhead VFR traffic patterns, pilots will adhere to all
   procedures outlined in applicable local procedures publications (e.g., local 11-250
   instructions).
   7.13.8. See Table 7.1 for inflight and traffic pattern limitations.
7.14. Emergency Limitations:
   7.14.1. Emergencies place unique demands on all crewmembers. Each situation requires
   proper analysis, correct application of appropriate procedures, preventive action to preclude
   recurrence or further degradation, and careful assessment of the aircraft and aircrew's
   capability to continue the mission. The following general guidance provides the aircraft
   commander a framework for making decisions in response to emergency situations:
      7.14.1.1. Maintain aircraft control.
      7.14.1.2. Assess the need for emergency egress.
      7.14.1.3. Perform required critical actions, assess the degree of degradation, and evaluate
      the capability to continue the mission.
      7.14.1.4. Contact the unit or controlling command post when encountering emergencies.
      While this should be accomplished as soon as practical, it should not interfere with
      immediate concerns dictated by the situation (i.e. aircraft control, checklist procedures,
      and notifying ARTCC agencies). Weigh carefully the impact of continuing the mission
      versus the capabilities of the aircraft and the aircrew.
 44                                   AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


       7.14.1.5. If aborting the mission, consider the following options:
           7.14.1.5.1. Return to the departure base or continue to the destination base via the
           most direct route.
           7.14.1.5.2. Land at the nearest suitable B-52 base.
           7.14.1.5.3. Land at the nearest suitable AFGSC/ACC base.
           7.14.1.5.4. Land at the nearest possible airfield.
           7.14.1.5.5. Only limited training is authorized while returning to the local area or
           reducing gross weight for landing. Prohibited activities are: low level navigation and
           bombing, fighter activity, transition, and air refueling (unless required for safe
           recovery of the aircraft).
       7.14.1.6. If continuing the mission, consider the effects on the mission of the following
       malfunctions:
           7.14.1.6.1. Loss of pressurization.
           7.14.1.6.2. Loss of mapping radar.
           7.14.1.6.3. Loss of navigation capability.
           7.14.1.6.4. Degraded instrument capability.
           7.14.1.6.5. Weather avoidance capability.
           7.14.1.6.6. Potential effect of multiple or compound equipment malfunctions.
   7.14.2. Takeoffs with one or more engines inoperative (peacetime) from start of takeoff roll
   are prohibited. EXCEPTION: During emergency evacuation, launch of aircraft with one or
   more engines inoperative may be accomplished at the discretion of the wing commander or
   when specifically directed by higher headquarters. At no time will launch be directed when
   computed takeoff distance exceeds 95 percent of runway available.
   7.14.3. If it becomes necessary to shut down two or more engines, or one engine for fire or
   fire indication, abort the mission.
   7.14.4. Refueling is not authorized with two or more engines inoperative or when any engine
   is shut down due to fire or fire indication, except when fuel is required to safely recover the
   aircraft.
   7.14.5. Compute performance with one or more engines inoperative assuming the loss of
   another engine.
   7.14.6. Aircraft with confirmed or suspected fuel leaks will abort the mission. Remain in the
   local area or proceed to the departure base or destination base by the most direct route. If
   circumstances permit, reduce to routine landing weight. Do not allow the center of gravity to
   exceed safe limitations or attempt any training activity, which would jeopardize safe
   recovery of the aircraft. Contact AFGSC controlling agencies for assistance.
7.15. Fuel Quantity Indication System Failure. During peacetime mission, each fuel quantity
indicator for each fuel tank must be fully operational. If a fuel quantity indicating system failure
is discovered prior to flight, the following exceptions apply:
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                    45


   7.15.1. When a standard fuel load results in one or more empty tanks, the respective fuel
   quantity indicator for the empty tank need not be fully operational provided:
      7.15.1.1. The tank will remain empty throughout the flight, including inflight refueling.
      7.15.1.2. The fuel quantity gauge indicates zero.
      7.15.1.3. The circuit breaker for the respective indicator is pulled and a safety clip
      installed to prevent inadvertent resetting.
   7.15.2. Aircraft may be flown with either one external or one outboard, but not more than
   one, wing tank gauge inoperative or malfunctioning, provided the following procedures are
   adhered to:
      7.15.2.1. The aircraft is loaded with a standard fuel load.
      7.15.2.2. The circuit breaker for the inoperative or malfunctioning gauge is pulled and a
      safety clip installed to prevent inadvertent resetting. In this situation, the pilots must
      realize that regardless of the gauge indication, the total fuel quantity indicator will be
      receiving indications that the tank is empty. Therefore, there will be a discrepancy
      between the total fuel quantity indication and the actual amount of fuel on board.
      7.15.2.3. The fuel flow indicator for that tank is fully operational.
      7.15.2.4. Pilots must be particularly watchful when using fuel from a tank having an
      inoperative or malfunctioning fuel gauge since the only indication of fuel flow will be the
      fuel flow indicator light, lateral trim indications, and balance of fuel between main tanks
      one and four. The Fuel Quantity Indicating System (FQIS) sends a voltage to the total
      fuel quantity gauge rather than a restrictive value. When the circuit breaker is pulled, the
      indication to the total fuel quantity indicator from that gauge will be zero.
7.16. Formation. Authorized formation types are described in AFTTP 3-3.B-52.
   7.16.1. Route/Observation, Air Refueling Visual Observation, and Fighting Wing/Wedge are
   visual formations and require day VMC. Aircraft commanders will be certified on their unit
   Letter of Xs (per AFI 11-2B-52V1) prior to flying these formation positions and before
   supervising their pilot.
   7.16.2. Route/Observation may be flown below 5,000‘ AGL only during departures,
   recoveries, or authorized flyovers.
   7.16.3. Route/Observation is not a tactical employment formation. Time spent in this
   formation will be minimized due to limited maneuverability and increased workload.
   Aircraft must be stabilized at 1,000‘ before proceeding closer to lead.
7.17. Aircrew and Aircraft Limitations:
   7.17.1. Brief all practice AFTTP 3-1.B-52 maneuvers or emergency procedures before the
   maneuver (either inflight or during mission planning). The pilot should alert all
   crewmembers prior to all maneuver demonstrations or inflight emergency procedures
   practice.
   7.17.2. Do not practice compound emergencies during critical phases of flight except those
   specifically authorized for CFIC training.
46                               AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


  7.17.3. In an actual emergency, terminate all training and emergency procedures practice.
  Resume training only when the pilot in command determines no hazard to safe aircraft
  operations exists.
  7.17.4. Seat occupancy guidance:
     7.17.4.1. During AFTTP 3-1.B-52, maneuvers and during emergencies, crewmembers
     will return to their respective crew positions and remain there unless operational
     requirements or the nature of the emergency dictate otherwise.
     7.17.4.2. When carrying nuclear weapons, mission ready crewmembers or instructors
     must occupy basic crew positions.
  7.17.5. RCR for typhoon or emergency evacuations. With NAF approval, an RCR of 12
  may be used for wet runway takeoff data computations during typhoon or emergency
  evacuations.

                                Chapter 8 (ANDERSENAFB)

                          LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES

8.1. (ANDERSENAFB) General.
   8.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Purpose. This chapter implements 36 OG B-52 Aircrew
   Operational Procedures.
   8.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Applicability. This chapter applies to all B-52 aircrew members
   assigned or attached to the 36 Operations Group (36 OG). B-52 Expeditionary Bomb
   Squadron (EBS) commanders may supplement with squadron-specific guidance or
   recommend changes with 36 Operations Group Commander (36 OG/CC) approval.
   8.1.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Waiver authority. The 36 OG/CC or OG/CD, unless stated
   otherwise, is the waiver authority for this supplement. Submit waivers for approval through
   the 36 OG Stan/Eval office (36 OG/OGV).
   8.1.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Recommended changes. Submit suggested improvements or
   changes to 36 OG/OGV via AF Form 847.
8.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Mission Planning.
   8.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Scheduling Planning Factors. Fly day show times will allow
   required time for mission planning and/or briefing (if not previously accomplished), step
   briefing and other step actions. Unless otherwise directed, ground timing flow will be IAW
   Table 1. When missions require compressed ground timing, a preflight crew may be used to
   meet mission timing (see Attachment 2 for buddy preflight procedures).

Table 8.1. Normal Ground Timing Flow
                                       STEP      STATION        START      TAXI
              CT Sorties               1+50        1+30          0+40      0+15
              Weapons Sorties          2+05        1+45          0+40      0+15
   8.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Scheduling of the defined local ATCAAs (ATCAA 1-5) and
   R7201 (Farallon de Medinilla range) requires prior coordination w/Joint Region Marianas J7
   [MIRC Ops] at (671)-339-2643 (see COMNAVMARIANAS INST 3502.1). EBS will
   schedule sufficient time blocks to allow for mission delays. Airborne requests for ATCAAs
   will be relayed through the Ops Sup, but are not normally granted.
   8.2.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Fuel Planning Requirements.
      8.2.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Initial Approach Fix (IAF) Fuel. Total fuel of 54,000 lbs
      is required at the IAF/over Guam. This allows 2 hours of holding in accordance with
      island destination procedures. IAF fuel will be increased by ballast or trapped fuel that is
      unavailable due to retained weapons (3,000 lbs ballast fuel for HSABs is assumed). IAF
      fuel will also be increased by the estimated additional fuel consumption in holding due to
      drag caused by retained weapons, hung gear, etc.
      8.2.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Sorties will be scheduled and planned with sufficient IAF
      fuel. If weapons are carried, assume weapons are retained through landing. If the IAF
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                  51


      fuel requirement with weapons and ballast leads to a gross weight that exceeds 290,000
      lbs, the preferred solution is to plan for full IAF fuel with an option to land at gross
      weights up to 325,000. The 36 OG/CC or OG/CD will be briefed in such cases.
      8.2.3.3. (ANDERSENAFB) If prevailing weather ±1 hour of landing requires an
      alternate, planned IAF fuel will be adjusted to allow divert to a non-local alternate (see
      8.9.2.).
      8.2.3.4. (ANDERSENAFB) All missions will be planned and conducted to optimize
      fuel conservation consistent with mission requirements.
   8.2.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Takeoff Data. See 36 WGI 13-204 Chapter 1 for Andersen
   AFB runway dimensions; however, the runway gradients published in 36 WGI 13-204 and in
   FLIP, etc, do not reflect the bowl shape of Andersen‘s runways. TOLD will be computed
   with the Andersen-specific charts in T.O. 1B-52H-1-1 or with approved mission planning
   software. The B-52 EBS In-flight Guide also contains TOLD tab data.
   8.2.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Mission Planning. Mission Planning Cell (MPC) operations
   will be accomplished in accordance with AFTTP 3-3.B-52. The EBS/CC will designate,
   with 36 OG/CC or designated representative approval, a primary MPC Team Chief who will
   be responsible for all combat operations. MPC team members will be qualified for the
   planned activity and/or weapon type (if applicable to the specific crew specialty).
      8.2.5.1. (ANDERSENAFB) The 36 OG/CC-designated Team Chief will administer
      mission planning assets and the associated workspace. The Team Chief, in consultation
      with the EBS Security Manager, will develop a security plan for all mission planning
      classified material. All personnel will comply with established security procedures.
      8.2.5.2. (ANDERSENAFB) For operations other than combat, the EBS/CC will assign
      Team Chief duties. MPC members may be unqualified if appropriately supervised.
8.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Preflight/Ground Operations.
   8.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircrew Publications. 36 OG/OGV will maintain a Flight
   Crew Information File (FCIF) with associated publications on the Andersen Air Force Base
   (AAFB) sharepoint site at https://andersen.eim.pacaf.af.mil/sites/OG_OGV/default.aspx.
   Crewmembers with access to online publications do not need to maintain individual copies,
   but are responsible for individual checklists.
      8.3.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) In addition to applicable technical orders (T.O.s) and Air
      Force Instructions (AFIs), aircrews will carry this publication, AAFBI 11-250, 36 WGI
      13-204, and 36 OG and B-52 EBS in-flight guides in flight.
      8.3.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) EBS/CCV will establish procedures for providing hard
      copies of required in-flight publications. The pilot in command will verify the currency
      of any prepositioned publications.
   8.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircrew Flight Equipment.
      8.3.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Survival Vests.
          8.3.2.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Training missions--Carriage is mandatory and wear is
          optional.
52                                 AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


         8.3.2.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Combat missions--Carriage is mandatory.                   All
         crewmembers will wear vests from the Fence In point to Fence Out point.
     8.3.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) LPUs must be worn for takeoff and at all times when
     strapped in over water. They will remain attached to the parachute when over open ocean
     and islands. During flight over water, an extra LPU will be carried on the aircraft (one
     per aircraft) in case a primary LPU is damaged or actuated in flight.
     8.3.2.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Anti-exposure suits will be carried by all crewmembers on
     sorties flying over oceans with forecast water temperatures at or below 60 F/15.5 C.
     8.3.2.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Laser Eye Protection (LEP). Each pilot on a crew
     employing the combat laser will check out an LEP from Aircrew Flight Equipment
     (AFE). For formations, the flight lead will brief any planned combat laser use and all
     pilots in the formation will carry LEPs. LEPs will be worn by all pilots (including the IP)
     in the aircraft/formation any time the combat laser is employed.
  8.3.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Thermal Stress Conditions (IAW 36 WGI 48-104 Prevention
  of Thermal Stress Disorders):
     8.3.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Heat Condition Black (defined as Wet Bulb Globe
     Temperature [WBGT] greater than 90°F; Maintenance Operations Center [MOC]
     maintains current information on WBGT). Aircrews are limited to 2 hours of ground
     activity without air conditioning. Aircrew will coordinate with the Ops Sup to request 36
     OG/CC or designated representative‘s permission to continue the preflight beyond the 2-
     hour station time if without air conditioning (time starts at aircraft show).
     8.3.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Heat Condition Red (defined as WBGT between 88°F
     and 89.9°F degrees). Aircrews are limited to 3 hours of ground activity without air
     conditioning (time starts at aircraft show).
  8.3.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Cartridge Start Procedures. Aircrews will coordinate with the
  36 OG Supervisor of Flying (SOF) to ensure fire coverage is available. The SOF will
  provide the Fire Department with time of start and parking location. The Fire Department
  will remain in standby status during the actual start and the SOF will notify the Fire
  Department when cartridge starts are complete. The Fire Department standby location will
  be at the discretion of the Fire Chief. If cart starts take place on the center ramp, an ARFF
  vehicle will be present.
8.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Normal Operations.
  8.4.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Sortie Delays/Extensions.
     8.4.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircrews delayed 4 hours past scheduled takeoff time will
     obtain EBS/CC‘s permission to continue the preflight (if in Heat Condition Red/Black,
     36 OG/CC must approve extensions).
     8.4.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircrews requiring duty day extensions (12 hour transition,
     16 hour non-augmented, or 24 hours augmented) will request approval from the 36
     OG/CC or 36 OG/CD (normally coordinated through the SOF or Ops Sup).
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                   53


     8.4.1.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircrews will coordinate with the Ops Sup before landing
     more than 15 minutes outside of their planned landing time. Aircrews taking off more
     than 15 minutes late will coordinate updated landing time and duration with the Ops Sup.
  8.4.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Engine Running Crew Change (ERCC) Sorties (Taxi-Back
  Landings). A follow-on sortie where the follow-on crew accepts the aircraft directly from
  the primary crew. Engines are not shut down and maintenance normally performs no actions
  in between sorties. Follow the Taxi-Back Landing procedures in T.O. 1B-52H-1 and AFI
  11-2B-52V3 guidance with the following additions:
     8.4.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircraft Recovery.
         8.4.2.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) ERCC input crews will plan to land at 270,000 lbs
         gross weight and on scheduled time. As soon as possible, the input crew will advise
         the Ops Sup of changes to planned landing time or fuel. When calling for recovery,
         the input crew will pass code 3 brevity codes and any other issues that might preclude
         ERCC accomplishment. The Ops Sup will relay this information to the SOF, the
         ERCC output crew, and the MOC who will inform the Production Supervisor.
         8.4.2.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) ERCC input crews will retain the drag chute on
         landing unless required for safety. If the drag chute is deployed (i.e. if the runway is
         wet), the Ops Sup will determine if the ERCC will be delayed or canceled and will
         notify the input/output crews.
         8.4.2.1.3. (ANDERSENAFB) ERCC input crews will stop on the rollout
         hammerhead and complete ERCC checklists. If taxiing to the center ramp (or other
         pre-coordinated location) is required, taxi to the desired location and then shut down
         outboard engines before maintenance activity is initiated. Release brakes when
         chocks are in place.
         8.4.2.1.4. (ANDERSENAFB) ERCC input crew will complete the AFTO Form 781
         and copy aircraft write-ups for maintenance debrief. The aircraft forms will remain
         on the aircraft.
     8.4.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircrew Changeover. All crewmembers will secure loose
     items and wear a helmet and gloves when exiting/boarding the aircraft.
         8.4.2.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) ERCC output crews will accomplish required mission
         planning and paperwork and then depart the EBS when the ERCC input crew lands.
         8.4.2.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) When the output crew arrives at the aircraft, all extra
         crewmembers will depart the aircraft to the bus. After extra crewmembers have left
         the aircraft, output crewmembers will proceed to the aircraft, beginning with the
         aircraft commander (AC). At all times, a pilot will monitor the aircraft and have
         access to the brake pedals.
         8.4.2.2.3. (ANDERSENAFB) The ERCC input AC will brief the ERCC output AC
         on the following: maintenance status, target trim, unstick speed (best flare) and brake
         energy absorbed.
         8.4.2.2.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Prior to departing for the bus, the ERCC input AC
         will ensure the Form F, DTCs (if applicable), required publications, FLIP and water
54                                 AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


         jug are still onboard the aircraft. Once the ERCC input AC has departed the aircraft,
         the ERCC output crew assumes responsibility for these items.
     8.4.2.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircraft Launch. Prior to restarting the outboard engines,
     ensure brakes are set and crew chief has a fire bottle readily available. Complete
     applicable ERCC checklist items. Prior to takeoff, perform a complete station check of
     all switch positions and instruments.
  8.4.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Quick Turn Sorties. A follow-on sortie with a minimum of 4
  hours between the first landing and the subsequent takeoff. During this time, maintenance
  will accomplish required actions, including refueling and repacking the drag chute. Aircrews
  will follow the Quick Turn checklists in T.O. 1B-52H-1.
     8.4.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Quick Turn sorties will be accomplished according to
     scheduled timing. Input crews will notify Bomber Ops as soon as practicable of any
     deviations from land time or code 3 maintenance issues.
     8.4.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Use of drag chute is assumed, though if conditions permit,
     it may be withheld at the aircrew‘s discretion. After landing, aircrews will accomplish
     the appropriate quick turn checklists and park on the center taxiway (unless otherwise
     directed by maintenance).
  8.4.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Quick ERCC (―Quirk‖) Sorties. A follow-on sortie where the
  engines are shut down. Maintenance will repack the drag chute but will not refuel the
  aircraft or perform a thru/post flight. Aircrew will follow the Quick Turn checklists in T.O.
  1B-52H-1 while complying with ERCC guidance above with the following exceptions:
     8.4.4.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Planned landing fuel will be 80,000 lbs or as directed.
     Aircrews will use the drag chute on landing unless landing at a lighter gross weight
     (270,000 lbs or less) with favorable conditions.
     8.4.4.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Upon landing, aircrews will run the Quick Turn checklists
     and shut down all engines when parking (helmet/gloves not required for changeover).
     Aircrews will meet at the EBS unless otherwise coordinated.
  8.4.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Communications.
     8.4.5.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Call Signs/Roles.
         8.4.5.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) The SOF is identified by the callsign ―FOXTROT.‖
         The SOF will normally handle ATC liaison issues and assist aircrew during ground
         and flight operations, particularly emergencies. Primary frequency is 377.8,
         secondary 252.1. Aircrews will monitor the SOF‘s frequency in the pattern and when
         able in the local area.
         8.4.5.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) ―BOMBER OPS‖ is the callsign for the EBS
         Operations Supervisor (Ops Sup), located at the EBS. The Ops Sup is responsible for
         scheduling/mission changes and associated flight coordination. Primary frequency is
         252.1; the Ops Sup will normally have Voice Satellite (VSAT) and Expeditionary
         Data Link (EDL) available as well. Aircrews will monitor the primary Bomber Ops
         frequency during preflight operations and relay any issue that may delay takeoff.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                              55


        8.4.5.1.3. (ANDERSENAFB) The SOF and Ops Sup normally monitor 252.1. This
        is also the primary interplane frequency with 227.3 as the secondary. The SOF may
        relay for the Ops Sup and/or accomplish actions on their behalf.
        8.4.5.1.4. (ANDERSENAFB) 36 OG/CC will be identified as ―COBRA 3‖ and the
        EBS/CC will use the call sign ―RAIDER/BARON/KNIGHTHAWK/DEVIL ONE.‖
        (Deputy or EBS/DO = ―__ ― TWO)
        8.4.5.1.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Preflight crews will identify by aircraft number.
        Personal names will not be used in clear communications; tactical call signs or crew
        positions may be substituted if required for clarification.
     8.4.5.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Mandatory Calls. (Made to)
        8.4.5.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Addition and/or deletions from the published flight
        orders.
        8.4.5.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Airborne call for the flight with takeoff time.
        8.4.5.2.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Maintenance            problems      affecting     mission
        accomplishment.
        8.4.5.2.4. (ANDERSENAFB) In-flight aborts.
        8.4.5.2.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Prior to beginning the en route descent/penetration –
        fuel remaining at the IAF/descent point, aircraft status and maintenance brevity
        codes.
        8.4.5.2.6. (ANDERSENAFB) 10 minutes from full stop – request transportation and
        parking.
     8.4.5.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Strategic       Arms      Reduction     Treaty   (START)
     Notifications. The Aircraft Commander will (directly, through Bomber Ops or other
     competent relay):
        8.4.5.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Notify AAFB Command Post within 1 hour of
        landing at, or 2 hours before departing from, any off station base for Command and
        Control and START treaty requirements.
        8.4.5.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Update AAFB Command Post within 1 hour after an
        off-station departure with an exact takeoff time for START treaty requirements.
     8.4.5.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Satellite/HF Communications Procedures.
        8.4.5.4.1. (ANDERSENAFB) When available, logon to the EDL net as soon as
        practicable. Maintain uplink until the AFTER LANDING checklist.
        8.4.5.4.2. (ANDERSENAFB) VSAT will be loaded on each mission to enable long-
        range communications, enhance aircrew proficiency and practice COMSEC.
        8.4.5.4.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Formations flying outside the local area will check
        the liaison radio during preflight. Whenever possible, HF issues should be resolved
        before flight. If VSAT connectivity is established with a capable ground station,
        position reports may be made by VSAT/telephone relay. This procedure should only
        be used for priority missions or malfunctions discovered in flight.

  8.4.6. (ANDERSENAFB) Low Altitude (LOWAT) Operations. Aircrews will not fly
  lower than 5000‘ AGL (except during takeoff, transition and landing) if they are not qualified
  and current in LOWAT or supervised by an instructor of like specialty.
     8.4.6.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Minimum altitude (except for takeoff, transition and
     landing) on all training missions is the designated Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) for
     SUAs and planned low altitude route segments or 1000‘ AGL/ASL, whichever is higher.
     8.4.6.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA) – An altitude at least
     1,000‘ (2,000‘ in mountainous terrain) above all obstacles within 5 NM of the course to
     be flown.
  8.4.7. (ANDERSENAFB) Recovery/Transition. During all transition operations, aircrews
  will clear for traffic visually at all times, whether operating under IFR or VFR. Radar,
  sensors and procedural means will also be used for deconfliction.
     8.4.7.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Andersen AFB Transition. Transition operations are
     permitted 24 hours a day.
         8.4.7.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Recovery Fuel. In flight, aircrews may adjust timing
         to arrive at the IAF with less than IAF fuel if reliable weather sources confirm VFR
         conditions through the proposed IAF time (plus or minus one hour). At no time
         should aircrews plan to land with less than 34,000 lbs total fuel.
         8.4.7.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Pilots will brief the unique challenges of the AAFB
         runway environment, including visual illusions, narrower runways, sloping terrain
         and runways, approaches over the cliff to RWY 24, parallel runways and taxiways
         and minimal airfield lighting. Mitigation techniques include mental preparation, use
         of glide slope/PAPIs, effective individual and cockpit crosscheck of instrument
         indications (especially airspeed), landing zone awareness and readback of clearances
         in and outside of the cockpit.
         8.4.7.1.3. (ANDERSENAFB) On a wet runway, with calm or tail winds or a
         downhill slope (RWY 24), a failed drag chute or excessive flare distance can cause
         total landing ground runs to exceed the runway available. Pilots must have complete
         landing data computed for any full stop landing on a wet runway, including brake
         energy/brake application data. Pilots should use distance remaining markers to
         ensure landings are accomplished in the touchdown zone.
         8.4.7.1.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Full stop landings on a wet runway above 280,000
         lbs gross weight will be avoided whenever possible. If required for safety of flight,
         landings on a wet runway above 280,000 lbs may be accomplished with 36 OG/CC or
         36 OG/CD approval. The drag chute will be deployed on all full stop landings on a
         wet runway.
         8.4.7.1.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Full-stop landings on dry runways are authorized
         between 290,000 and 325,000 lbs gross weight provided the crew briefs best flare
         speed, power control, drag chute deployment, brake energy, estimated CG, and
         planned landing ground run prior to commencing the approach. Landings up to
         300,000 lbs gross weight are authorized without prior coordination; however,
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                     57


         landings above 300,000 require EBS/CC approval and should be made only in
         situations where deteriorating conditions are a factor.
         8.4.7.1.6. (ANDERSENAFB) Retention of the drag chute is permitted only for full-
         stop landings on runway at or below 250,000 lbs gross weight on a dry runway in
         effort to assist maintenance in post-flight operations.
         8.4.7.1.7. (ANDERSENAFB) If multiple aircraft are in the pattern and one runway
         is unavailable, aircrews will coordinate with the Ops Sup before continuing transition
         below IAF fuel.
      8.4.7.2. (ANDERSENAFB) B-52 Overhead. Preferred entry is via radar vectors or
      VFR to 5NM initial instead of the VFR entry points. Fly no faster than 250 KIAS by a 5
      NM initial. Aircraft should have airbrakes 4 set and be trimmed prior to the break.
      Aircraft will be in landing configuration by the perch point. If a breakout is required,
      breakout to the appropriate VFR entry point unless otherwise coordinated.
      8.4.7.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Off-Station Transition. Low approaches (including
      simulated emergency patterns) are permitted at Guam International Airport and Saipan
      International Airport when approved by ATC. For all other off-station training the
      following restrictions apply:
         8.4.7.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Planned off-station transition must be annotated on
         the 21-165 flying schedule or approved by the 36 OG/CC or 36 OG/CD.
         8.4.7.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) All full-stop off-station landings will comply with
         8.4.5.3. and will be annotated on the 21-165 flying schedule or approved by the 36
         OG/CC or 36 OG/CD. Refer to Attachment 1 if participating in a flyby or aerial
         demonstration.
8.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Instrument Procedures.
8.5.1. (ANDERSENAFB) General. Runway 06R is the primary instrument runway. Refer to
the AAFBI 11-250 and36 WGI 13-204 for a full description of pattern operations and IFR
service procedures.
      8.5.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) IFR Filing Procedures. DD Form 1801 will be filed for
      all flights departing AAFB. Pilots will follow filing procedures in FLIP General
      Planning and Area Planning 3. Pilots must also understand the different types of fixes
      available. Pilots will neither file nor accept a clearance to a non-compatible fix (i.e., the
      Saipan NDB), even if the point may be identified by alternate means.
      8.5.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) While aircrews will file and attempt to fly in defined
      ATCAAs, Guam Center routinely grants clearances which can accommodate most
      training (i.e. ―cleared xx altitude within xx miles of Nimitz VORTAC‖). Aircrews will
      be vigilant in adhering to such clearances and are reminded that it does not represent a
      MOA/ATCAA – in particular, MARSA operations such as independent maneuvering are
      not approved unless requested and speed restrictions still apply.
   8.5.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Practice Airborne Radar Approach (ARA).
      8.5.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Pilots will advise Guam Center during the initial request
      for an en-route descent their intentions for an ARA. Aircrews should expect radar
58                                AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


     vectors to a TACAN approach to an ARA. For the full ARA procedure, request with
     ATC to overfly the field (typically at FL250) for a teardrop descent, then own navigation
     to TACAN final, then the ARA procedure.
     8.5.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) An ARA may be flown on subsequent patterns by
     requesting own navigation from downwind to final.
  8.5.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Operations in Marginal Weather. When forecast weather at
  time of landing, plus or minus one hour, is:
     8.5.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Ceiling below 1,000' and/or visibility less than 2 miles:
        8.5.3.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Adjust mission timing to land at the most favorable
        time consistent with mission requirements. This plan will be coordinated with the
        Ops Sup.
        8.5.3.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Consider if a divert is warranted based on forecast
        duration/extent of adverse weather at Andersen, Guam International and Saipan
        International.
        8.5.3.1.3. (ANDERSENAFB) If actual conditions are below 1000‘/2, land with IAF
        fuel.
     8.5.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Ceiling below 500' and/or visibility less than 1 mile:
        8.5.3.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Adjust mission timing to land at the most favorable
        time consistent with mission requirements. This plan will be coordinated with the
        Ops Sup.
        8.5.3.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Consider if a divert is warranted based on forecast
        duration/extent of adverse weather at Andersen, Guam International and Saipan
        International.
        8.5.3.2.3. (ANDERSENAFB) With actual conditions below 500‘/1, multiple
        approaches require 36 OG/CC or 36 OG/CD approval.
8.6. (ANDERSENAFB) Weapons Employment.
  8.6.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Target Study. The Mission Planning Cell (MPC) Team Chief is
  the OPR for all route and target study.
     8.6.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Target study will include at a minimum all crewmembers
     occupying a primary crew position during the planned weapons activity and primary
     instructors. Additional instructors and crewmembers should attend whenever possible.
     Subsequent primary crew changes will require another target study briefing, unless an
     instructor who attended the first briefing will supervise a single new crewmember.
     8.6.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Target Study Officers (TSOs) will provide route and target
     study for all missions planned with actual weapon releases and HHDs. TSO certification
     requirements will be determined by the MPC Team Chief. The Radar Navigator may
     accomplish route/target study for training missions with simulated weapons.
     8.6.1.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircrews accomplishing the same weapon/mission activity
     on consecutive days or for TDY return sorties do not require additional target study if
     there are no changes from the previously briefed information.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                  59


     8.6.1.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Target study for actual weapons releases will clearly
     identify planned activity from permissible activity to allow an appropriate level of
     flexibility in execution. For example, a target may be planned on a 350 release heading,
     but range restrictions allow a heading of 270 to 040. The TSO will brief alternate targets,
     parameters and procedures. Changes to simulated releases may be briefed and executed
     in flight, as long as they do not violate range/training rules.
  8.6.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Actual Weapons Release.
     8.6.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) After each weapons release, aircrews will determine the
     status of weapons before proceeding with further releases or other training. In combat,
     this step may be omitted if onboard indications show good releases.
     8.6.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) For local jettison operations, refer to AAFBI 11-250 and
     36 WGI 13-204. Otherwise, comply with briefed procedures and command guidance. If
     jettison is unsuccessful, follow hung weapons procedures.
     8.6.2.3. (ANDERSENAFB) If visual inspection (by bomb bay camera or bomb bay
     check) positively confirms all internal weapons have departed the aircraft, simulated
     internal weapon releases may be accomplished over the bombing range and open
     ocean/uninhabited islands. Outside the range/open ocean, simulate only external releases
     with the Bombing System Switch in MANUAL and the bomb doors remaining closed.
     After landing, do not open the bomb doors until maintenance has inspected the bomb bay.
     8.6.2.4. (ANDERSENAFB) As soon as practicable after weapons activity and before
     returning to the traffic pattern, inform the SOF of released, retained or hung weapon
     conditions. Provide the following information: Number of attempted releases, visual
     confirmation/visual inspection results; number, type, and location of hung weapons(s),
     and specifics regarding status – i.e., hung/unconfirmed hung (see 8.6.3.).
     8.6.2.5. (ANDERSENAFB) After engine shutdown, coordinate with maintenance to
     inspect all external weapons positions for missing lanyards or other potential dropped
     objects. If missing items are identified, coordinate with Airfield Operations to conduct a
     runway sweep.
  8.6.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Hung/Retained Weapons.
     8.6.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Weapons Status Definitions. Refer to AFI 11-2B-52v3
     for definitions of hung and unconfirmed hung weapons, and for procedures to remove an
     unconfirmed hung weapons status.
     8.6.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Hung Weapons. If landing with hung weapons, declare
     an IFE.
        8.6.3.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircraft landing with hung or unconfirmed hung
        ordnance should fly an approach to and land on Runway 24R/24L. If winds are out of
        limits for a Runway 24R/24L landing, the aircraft should request a circling approach
        to land on Runway 06R/06L, avoiding over flight of populated areas and buildings if
        possible. A runway sweep will be accomplished for all aircraft with hung weapons.
        8.6.3.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) After landing, taxi to C-4 or C-68 or as directed by
        ATC or SOF and coordinate with incident commander for a weapons specialists to
        meet the aircraft and determine status of weapons.
60                                AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


        8.6.3.2.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Weapons not secure: Ensure brakes are set, shut
        down engines and egress the aircraft. When notified of weapons status, the incident
        commander (normally the fire chief) will establish a cordon around the aircraft.
        8.6.3.2.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Weapons secure: After termination of the IFE and
        when cleared by B-52 MX Super, taxi to park. External power will not be applied
        and bomb bay doors will not be opened if internal weapons were carried.
     8.6.3.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Retained Weapons. Declaring an IFE is not required.
        8.6.3.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) When clear of runway, aircrews will meet
        maintenance personnel who will visually inspect the weapons for abnormalities. If
        no abnormalities exist, aircrews will continue taxi to park.
        8.6.3.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) External power will not be applied in parking unless
        all weapons are pinned. Bomb bay doors will not be opened if internal weapons are
        retained.
  8.6.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Visual Ground-Based Inspection (VGBI). VGBI procedures
  are required for aircraft with unconfirmed hung external weapons. All VGBIs will be
  accomplished by a minimum of two SOF or weapons qualified B-52 crewmembers and
  coordinated by the SOF. Visual inspection of the bomb bay from the ground is not
  authorized. VGBI will not be requested unless necessary for follow-on training.
     8.6.4.1. (ANDERSENAFB) The minimum weather required for the VGBI procedure is
     the circling minimums for Runway 24.
     8.6.4.2. (ANDERSENAFB) The VGBI may only be accomplished during daylight
     hours.
     8.6.4.3. (ANDERSENAFB) The aircraft requiring VGBI will notify the SOF at least 30
     minutes before the approach. This allows time for the VGBI ground observers to
     position themselves.
        8.6.4.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Ground observers performing the VGBI will acquire
        the following items for the check: LMR or cell phone (if SOF is in the tower) and two
        pairs of binoculars. Two-way voice communication with the SOF is required.
        8.6.4.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Observers will be in position on the perimeter road
        nearest to the approach for Runway 24. Observers will notify the SOF when they are
        in position for the VGBI. Observers will not enter the ―ILS CRITICAL AREA‖
        when performing VGBI.
     8.6.4.4. (ANDERSENAFB) The aircraft will conduct a low approach to Runway 24, as
     this runway is the primary for hung weapons recoveries.
     8.6.4.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Ground observers must be able to clearly see and inspect
     all external stations on which weapons were loaded. Both observers must confirm
     weapons status. If they are unable to inspect all the required stations, the aircraft may
     request another low approach to determine weapons status.
     8.6.4.6. (ANDERSENAFB) SOFs will coordinate with tower to expedite aircraft
     vectoring during climbout in order to minimize flight time over any populated areas.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                   61


     8.6.4.7. (ANDERSENAFB) Once status of the weapons is determined, ground
     observers will pass weapons status to the SOF. The SOF will then pass the status to the
     aircraft. If all weapons are confirmed released, the aircrew may continue training without
     any further restrictions.
  8.6.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Flare Procedures.
     8.6.5.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Inform SOF of as soon as practicable following flare
     activity of projected landing time. Coordinate with Airfield Ops for a runway sweep.
     8.6.5.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Regardless of cockpit indications, stop the aircraft on the
     departure end hammerhead and allow weapons personnel to check flare status.
     8.6.5.3. (ANDERSENAFB) If flares remain on the aircraft but present no hazard (as
     determined by weapons personnel), taxi to parking.
     8.6.5.4. (ANDERSENAFB) If flares are hung or present a hazard, declare an
     emergency, ensure brakes are set, shut down engines and egress the aircraft.
8.7. (ANDERSENAFB) Weather Planning Factors.
  8.7.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Thunderstorm Weather Advisories. Crews and support
  personnel will comply with 36 WGI 15-101 Andersen Weather Support. Andersen Weather
  Flight will make the following advisories which will be relayed through the Ops Sup, SOF or
  ATC Tower (through ATIS):
     8.7.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Thunderstorms observed in the local flying area (within 50
     NM of the base).
     8.7.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Thunderstorms observed within 25 NM of the base.
     8.7.1.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Thunderstorms observed within 10 NM of the base.
     8.7.1.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Lightning Watch - potential exists for lightning within 5
     NM of the base within the next 30 minutes. Evacuation of the ramp is not required.
     8.7.1.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Lightning Warning - lightning observed within 5 NM of
     the base. Aircrew will evacuate the ramp with maintenance or remain in the aircraft with
     all hatches and windows closed. If lightning is expected to remain in the area for an
     extended period, aircrew may shutdown engines. Aircraft grounding is not required.
  8.7.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Operations with Thunderstorms.
     8.7.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) 36 OG/CC or 36 OG/CD must approve takeoffs,
     approaches and landings when thunderstorms are within 10 NM of the airfield.
     Thunderstorms must not be producing hazardous conditions at the airfield, be in the
     takeoff or landing corridors, nor forecast to move in the direction of those corridors. This
     approval will be in effect for 10 minutes. Multiple approaches will not be conducted
     under such circumstances.
     8.7.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) In flight, aircrew will avoid thunderstorms by 10 NM
     laterally (20 NM if at or above flight level 230).
  8.7.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Wind and Sea State Restrictions. Normal flying operations
  will not be conducted when surface winds along the intended route of flight exceed 35 knots
62                                  AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


  steady state over land (25 knots over water) or when the sea state exceeds 10 feet wave
  height, unless approved by the 36 OG/CC or designated representative. This is not intended
  to restrict point-to-point operations or ocean crossings when only a small portion of the route
  is affected. If possible, alter the planned route to avoid the high winds and high sea state area.
  Use forecast conditions only if actual conditions are not known.
8.8. (ANDERSENAFB) Bird Hazard Warning System.
  8.8.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Low Altitude Training/Fly-Bys/Off-Station Transition/Other
  Training below 5000 Feet AGL.
     8.8.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Mission planning crew responsibilities.
         8.8.1.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Review all applicable Bird Avoidance Model (BAM)
         data (Avian Hazard Advisory System at http://www.usahas.com, NEXRAD
         information, etc.) if available. If applicable, contact the site or range control officer
         (RCO) for recent bird trends. Contact FOXTROT or the Air Traffic Control Tower
         as required for real-time bird condition information.
         8.8.1.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) If AHAS or the RCO predicts Moderate or Severe
         conditions for the training area, crews will call the applicable base operations/range to
         check the actual bird watch condition (BWC).
         8.8.1.1.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Do not schedule sorties into training routes or areas
         with an AHAS forecast of severe, unless the actual BWC is reported moderate or low.
     8.8.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) In-flight restrictions.
         8.8.1.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Do not conduct fly-by/off station transition if the
         BWC is moderate or greater.
         8.8.1.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Do not fly in routes and areas with reported severe
         bird conditions.
         8.8.1.2.3. (ANDERSENAFB) If BAM forecast is severe, attempt to contact the
         local airfield operations for current bird conditions.
  8.8.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Transition at Andersen AFB.
     8.8.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) The authority to declare bird watch conditions rests with
     the Airfield Manager, but is normally delegated to the SOF. The Chief of Safety, Flight
     Safety NCO or Control Tower Watch Supervisor may recommend bird watch conditions.
     Indications of bird activity can be an actual bird strike, bird activity/near miss calls from
     aircrew to SOF or bird notification from an outside source (CERAP or Guam approach)
     of bird activity in the area.
     8.8.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Bird Watch Alert. Weather, time of day and seasonal
     conditions can make an influx of birds likely. This in itself does not identify a particular
     bird watch condition.
     8.8.2.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Bird Watch Condition (BWC) restrictions:
         8.8.2.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Severe. Heavy concentrations on the field, in
         approach/departure corridors or the pattern.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                  63


             8.8.2.3.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Transition is prohibited.
             8.8.2.3.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Takeoffs and full stop landings require 36
             OG/CC or 36 OG/CD approval.
         8.8.2.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Moderate. Soaring birds or small flocks on the field,
         in approach/departure corridors or pattern.
             8.8.2.3.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Touch-and-go landings require 36 OG/CC or 36
             OG/CD approval. If approved, accomplish the minimum required landings as long
             as birds do not present a hazard to aircraft flight path.
             8.8.2.3.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Restrict low approaches to 200' above bird
             concentrations (determined by SOF).
         8.8.2.3.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Low.                 Low intensity bird activity with low
         probability of hazard – no training restrictions.
     8.8.2.4. (ANDERSENAFB) After observing moderate or severe bird activity, crews
     will contact SOF or AAFB tower and request the following data be passed to other pilots:
         8.8.2.4.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Location and altitude of birds.
         8.8.2.4.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Time of sighting.
         8.8.2.4.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Approximate number and type of birds.
         8.8.2.4.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Behavior of birds (soaring, flying to or from a
         specific location, etc.).
8.9. (ANDERSENAFB) Abnormal Operating Procedures.
  8.9.1. (ANDERSENAFB) In-flight Emergencies (IFEs). In the event of an in-flight
  emergency, the Aircraft Commander is the final authority for decisions affecting the safety of
  the aircraft. If practical, delay landing until 36 OG/CC or 36 OG/CD concurrence to land is
  obtained. Obtain actual approach and landing clearance from ATC. After landing, contact
  the incident commander on the primary discrete emergency frequency (238.050) once the
  aircraft has come to a complete stop and brakes are set. The on-scene fire chief will
  terminate the IFE and will relay the termination to the aircrew.
     8.9.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) As soon as practicable, notify the SOF of any impending
     IFE. Coordinate recovery timing with the SOF. Contact the SOF no later than the
     commencement of penetration/en route descent; the SOF will ensure required actions are
     complete and the 36 OG/CC or OG/CD is notified.
     8.9.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) The Duty Instructor Pilot (DIP) is available to assist
     aircrew in the safe recovery of the aircraft. DIP assistance may be requested through the
     SOF.
     8.9.1.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Declaring the IFE. When able, declare an IFE with ATC
     no later than 10 minutes prior to landing. Once an IFE is declared, priority will be given
     to the IFE aircraft. Provide the following information:
         8.9.1.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Call sign and aircraft tail number.
64                                  AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


         8.9.1.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Narrative description of problem, pilot‘s intentions
         and assistance required, if any.
         8.9.1.3.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Current position and ETA to the local area.
         8.9.1.3.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Fuel remaining and persons on board.
         8.9.1.3.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Condition of any weapons onboard, whether hung or
         retained.
         8.9.1.3.6. (ANDERSENAFB) Planned landing time and gross weight.
     8.9.1.4. (ANDERSENAFB) The CONFERENCE HOTEL is a ground electronic net
     designed to aid aircrew with in flight emergencies. If requested by the aircrew, the
     conference, facilitated by COBRA CONTROL, includes 36 OG/CC or OG/CD, Fire
     Chief, the Duty IP, the SOF and the Maintenance Supervisor. Others can join the net as
     needed.
  8.9.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Divert Procedures. Neither Guam International, Saipan
  International nor Iwo Jima meets the normal requirements for a B-52 runway. Accordingly,
  diverts should not be considered a routine operation. Pilots will follow the restrictions of this
  publication coupled with sound judgment when considering divert recovery options.
     8.9.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) The nearest fully compatible divert options, Kadena AB
     and Yokota AB, are greater than 2 hours from AAFB. The ‗local‘ diverts (Guam,
     Saipan) are approved for emergency use only. Pilots will consider use of Kadena,
     Yokota or Iwo Jima if local diverts are unsuitable, but will proceed as outlined below.
     8.9.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) The SOF will monitor the weather and status of divert
     bases and will make recommendations to aircrews if conditions deteriorate at AAFB. If
     outside UHF range, the Ops Sup will use VSAT or EDL to relay information. At all
     times, aircrews will be proactive in obtaining current weather information and planning
     contingencies.
     8.9.2.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircrews will attempt to hold in the local area until able to
     land at AAFB. Aircrews will leave holding and proceed to the primary alternate, Guam
     International, when they reach 35,000 lbs. This will allow a missed approach at Guam
     and a divert to the secondary alternate, Saipan International (20,000 at landing + 1,000 to
     Guam + 4,000 for approach/missed + 7,000 to Saipan + 3,000 for approach). If Guam
     International is unavailable, crews will proceed to Saipan.
     8.9.2.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Notify SOF and/or Ops Sup when diverting, the base
     selected and the planned fuel reserve over the divert base. Contact Ops Sup and the 36
     WG Command Post after landing with tail number, land time and a point of contact.
     Comply with paragraph 8.4.5.3.
     8.9.2.5. (ANDERSENAFB) When returning from a divert, obtain clearance from 36
     OG/CC or 36 OG/CD prior to launch.
  8.9.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Hot Brakes.
     8.9.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) With brake energy in the Caution or Danger Zone, comply
     with T.O. 1B-25H-1 and the following:
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                                  65


         8.9.3.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) If able, on landing rollout or after an aborted take-off
         with potential hot brakes, taxi to the hammerhead east or west end of Taxiway
         Charlie (or as directed by ATC) and park facing into the wind with no personnel or
         aircraft within 300‘ of affected brakes.
         8.9.3.1.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Notify Ground or Tower of intentions and request
         fire coverage for hot brakes.
         8.9.3.1.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Set the parking brake. Maintenance will release
         brakes after chocks are installed to aid cooling.
         8.9.3.1.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Contact Bomber Ops and request maintenance and
         fire department support for hot brakes. Pass call sign, tail number, location and brake
         energy level whenever possible.
         8.9.3.1.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Evacuate the aircraft, avoid responding vehicles and
         notify incident commander, maintenance and fire department. Given the gradients at
         AAFB, aircrews will assess the dangers of waiting for chocks against the possibility
         of the aircraft rolling. A parachute or other object of opportunity may be used as a
         chock. If chocks are not available in time, the parking brake will be left on.
         8.9.3.1.6. (ANDERSENAFB) Enter the computed brake energy in the AFTO Form
         781A.
     8.9.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Crew actions following a visual report of hot brakes:
         8.9.3.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Stop and park the aircraft at the closest location clear
         of taxi routes and congested areas.
         8.9.3.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Ensure brakes are released (only if chocks installed).
         8.9.3.2.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Request fire coverage.
         8.9.3.2.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Ensure no personnel, aircraft or vehicles are within
         300‘ of the aircraft.
         8.9.3.2.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Evacuate the aircraft, avoid responding vehicles and
         notify the incident commander, maintenance and fire department.
  8.9.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Tower Fly-By for Abnormal Gear Indications or Gear
  Malfunctions. Aircraft with abnormal gear indications or signs of gear malfunction during
  any part of flight will accomplish a fly-by the Tower or SOF location prior to landing for a
  visual check of the landing gear. The SOF will be responsible for the visual check. The
  procedures for Visual Ground Based Inspection may be used to determine gear position (see
  8.6.4.).
  8.9.5. (ANDERSENAFB) On-scene Commander Guidelines. When flying a mission, in
  peacetime or combat, crewmembers may be called upon to serve as an On-scene Commander
  (OSC) to aid in the Search and Rescue Operations of a downed aircraft. Use the checklist in
  the IFG.
  8.9.6. (ANDERSENAFB) Stuck Outboard Strut Bleed Valves.
 66                                 AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


       8.9.6.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircraft commanders may elect to start engines 1&2 and/or
       7&8 with an air cart as long as fire coverage is coordinated through the SOF and
       available from engine start until takeoff.
       8.9.6.2. (ANDERSENAFB) After landing, immediately shutdown outboard engines
       with stuck strut bleed valve in accordance with T.O. 1B-52H-1.
8.10. (ANDERSENAFB) Functional           Check       Flights/Operational      Check      Flights
(FCF/OCF). If required, FCF/OCF flights will be conducted IAW T.O. 1B-52H-6, AFI 11-418,
and AFI 21-101. When an aircraft requires an FCF or OCF, the 36 OG/CC or 36 OG/CD, with
coordination from the EBS SQ/CC, will issue temporary written certification designating the
most highly qualified crew available to conduct the flight. The FCF Program Manager (36
OG/OGV) will draft the memo and include details of the flight, including date, crewmembers
and profile. Maintenance Quality Assurance will brief the crew on specific requirements.

                AIR SHOWS AND OFF-STATION TRAINING FLIGHTS

Note: All Flyover or Aerial Demonstration off-station flights require a minimum of PACAF/A3
approval and host MAJCOM approval (if required). Follow guidance in AFI 11-209 and
PACAF supplements. See http://www.airshows.pa.hq.af.mil/ for more information and approval
lists.
A5.1. (ANDERSENAFB) General. All Off-station Training Flight (OSTF) events other than
transition require completion of a Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) package for coordination and
approval no later than 3 weeks prior to event departure (5 weeks prior for OCONUS events).
The SSS package must contain event details, applicable waivers and airfield diagrams (from
FLIP). (N/A HHD deployments)
   A5.1.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Air shows. Air shows are off-station flights generated by a
   host unit or organization written request for B-52H support for static or flyover activity.
A5.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Air Show Liaison Officer. The EBS/DO will designate an Air
Show Liaison Officer who will coordinate air shows and will remain the event POC until the
EBS/DO assigns a crew. The Air Show Liaison Officer maintains example air show packages
and applicable instructions. For OCONUS air shows, the Air Show Liaison Officer will also
ensure applicable Foreign Clearance Guide requirements are met.
A5.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Waivers. Include all necessary waivers in the event package.
   A5.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) 36 OG/CC or OG/CD is the waiver authority for runway and
   taxiway requirements (runway 10,000‘x200‘; taxiway 175‘) or for landing at any airfield
   where the combination of the planned landing ground run plus 2500‘ flare distance exceeds
   80 percent of the available runway.
   A5.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Host airfield managers may grant waivers when maximum
   load bearing capacities for runways, taxiways, and parking ramps are less than planned
   aircraft gross weight for landing, taxi, and subsequent takeoff. The B-52H has ―twin
   tandem‖ landing gear. See the Flight Information Handbook for B-52 Pavement
   Classification Number requirements.
A5.4. (ANDERSENAFB) Planning. Refer to AFI 11-2B52v3 and ―Strange Field Procedures‖
section of T.O. 1B-52H-1 for planning purposes.
   A5.4.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Pilot requirements. Coordinate with Air Boss/Air Show Rep
   for arrival/departure days/times. Determine airfield dimensions and load-bearing capacity
   and coordinate waivers as required. Reference ―Turning Radius and Ground Clearance‖
   section found in Section 2 of the flight manual. Complete the SSS and verify approval.
   A5.4.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Copilot requirements. Compute TOLD for event‘s airfield.
   Determine fuel requirements (on-load at air show and return fuel required) and notify
   scheduling. For flights to civilian fields, ensure that the local fuel contractor has approved
   fuel and a government ―INTO-PLANE‖ fuel contract. Complete Form F with extra
   equipment and extra crew luggage.
 82                                 AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012


   A5.4.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Radar Navigator/Navigator requirements. Coordinate with
   scheduling for training activities, tankers, take-off, and arrival times prior to the 21-165
   meeting. Complete flight plans/charts for deploy and return flights. Compute Enroute
   Decision Point referenced in A5.5.1.
   A5.4.4. (ANDERSENAFB) EW requirements. Submit TDY requests to the squadron
   orderly room at least 14 working days before departure. Coordinate with host airfield for
   classified storage (Comm kits, DTUCs, etc.) and aircraft security.
       A5.4.4.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Contact 36 WG SFS/SFO to preplan all security
       arrangements. Assess the threat, security presence, detection, entry control and response
       capabilities of available resources.
       A5.4.4.2. (ANDERSENAFB) When destination security cannot be arranged,
       consideration must be given to not supporting the mission or re-routing the aircraft to a
       safer location to remain overnight.
   A5.4.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Scheduling requirements. Plan RAP effective sorties for
   deploy and return flights whenever possible, taking advantage of ESS sites and tankers not
   often available. Flight schedulers will coordinate MAMS airspace deconfliction and confirm
   tanker and fighter availability, as required.
A5.5. (ANDERSENAFB) Deployment. Deploy with the following items: TDY orders with
variations authorized, ID card, line badge, normal flying gear and manuals, signed flight orders
for all planned flights and sufficient MARs and mission planning materials to cover TDY.
   A5.5.1. (ANDERSENAFB) En Route Decision Point (EDP). Aircrews will establish an
   EDP for their route of flight that provides sufficient fuel to return to Andersen AFB or a 36
   OG/CC or OG/CD approved base with appropriate fuel reserves. Upon reaching the EDP, if
   the forecast landing weather at the intended landing base is below minimums or if the aircraft
   is no longer launch capable, the crew will return to Andersen AFB or divert to the approved
   base.
   A5.5.2. (ANDERSENAFB) After Landing. Aircraft Commanders are responsible for the
   security of the aircraft and must preplan security arrangements with 36 SFS/SFO prior to
   departure.
       A5.5.2.1. (ANDERSENAFB) The Aircraft Commander will establish contact with an
       official 24-hour SDO that can function as a point of contact for the crew in case of an
       emergency. The aircraft commander will provide this point of contact to COBRA
       CONTROL and EBS/DO. Additionally, provide COBRA CONTROL with contact
       phone number and START notification (see 8.4.5.3).
       A5.5.2.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Aircraft will not be left unattended at locations where
       security is inadequate. During display periods, the aircrew will remain with the aircraft
       for information and security purposes. At either civilian airports or DOD installations,
       the aircrew will ensure they know the procedures for requesting civilian or military police
       assistance. If the aircraft remains overnight, remove all personal items, professional gear
       and high-theft flight equipment (except parachutes).
A5.6. (ANDERSENAFB) Return. If the returning mission is significantly changed from the
original approved sortie, obtain launch clearance from the 36 OG/CC or OG/CD prior to takeoff.
AFI11-2B-52V3_ANDERSENAFBSUP_I 15 JUNE 2012                                               83


No later than 3 hours prior to departure, the aircraft commander will provide the information
specified in the Off Base Clearance Request to 36 OG/CC or OG/CD. Ensure START
notification is made (see 8.4.5.3). After landing, complete an After Action Report. Return
completed report to Air show Liaison Officer.

                                        PREFLIGHT CREW

A6.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Preflight Crews. In order to enhance response time, mitigate
maintenance issues and provide more crew rest on long duration sorties, a preflight crew may be
directed to accomplish preflight actions for the flying crew. The following template is based on
using the preflight crew as the DNIF cover. If manpower is available, a separate DNIF cover can
be established, allowing the preflight crew to start their duty day and preflight aircraft earlier if
desired. Also, an additional crew can be assigned to preflight/start a spare aircraft. Times may
be modified IAW mission requirements and EBS/CC discretion.

A6.2. (ANDERSENAFB) Preflight crews may consist of just one radar or navigator (in
addition to pilots and EW). To provide a flexible DNIF cover, this offender should be able to sit
in either seat. If any crewmember is unable to fly at crew show, a preflight crewmember will
take his/her place and the primary crewmember will preflight (if able).
A6.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Preflight crews will bring the following items to the aircraft:
   A6.3.1. (ANDERSENAFB) Secrets: Crew comm and DTCs to load OAS (bring mission
   DTCs if available)
   A6.3.2. (ANDERSENAFB) FLIP/Pubs (if required)

   A6.3.3. (ANDERSENAFB) Water jugs (if available at step; otherwise jugs will go with
   duty crew or flying crew)
   A6.3.4. (ANDERSENAFB) LMRs (―bricks‖)
A6.4. (ANDERSENAFB) To allow flexibility in execution, preflight crews will not normally
load crew-specific items. If maintenance delays are encountered, jets can be reassigned as
needed. For this reason, and for COMSEC, preflight crews will identify themselves by tail
number over the radio.
A6.5. (ANDERSENAFB) The Ops Sup will match aircrews to jets NLT flying crew step time.
The flying crew will need to bring all mission materials, personal gear, lunches and life support
equipment.
A6.6. (ANDERSENAFB) The Ops Sup will determine if preflight crew will prep the spare,
and to what level. The Ops Sup will also determine when the spare preflight crew will be
released (taxi, takeoff, gear and flaps up, level off, etc.).
