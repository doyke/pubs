This instruction implements AFPD 32-90, Real Property Asset Management, and interfaces with
AFI 32-9004, Disposal of Real Property. It prescribes USAFE Form 27, Air Force Real
Property Inventory and Condition Report, and explains how to document the release of Air
Force real property to a Host Nation during installation closure or draw down. It applies to all
installations under HQ USAFE real property jurisdiction, control, and accountability. The base
civil engineering real property function is responsible for adhering to this instruction. For the
complete or partial release of installations in the Federal Republic of Germany, additional
provisions of USAFEI 32-9005, Acquiring, Managing, and Disposing of Real Estate in the
Federal Republic of Germany, apply. This instruction does not apply to US Air Force Reserve
Command (AFRC) or Air National Guard (ANG) units. Refer recommended changes and
questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using Air Force
(AF) Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field
through the appropriate functional’s chain of command. Ensure that all records created as a
result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with AFMAN 33-
363, Management of Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records
Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). See
Attachment 1 for a glossary of references and supporting information.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This USAFEI has been updated to reflect current office symbols.            Furthermore the
documentation describing US Dollar investments to United Kingdom Ministry of Defense family
housing has been clarified.
1. Documenting Installation Release. The following documents are essential to any release
action and must be provided to HQ USAFE/A7AR immediately upon return of any installation:
     1.1. 7115 report of returned installation (if partial return, clearly mark facilities returned).
     1.2. Minutes of Return or appropriate host nation document.
     1.3. USAFE Form 27, Air Force Real Property Inventory and Condition Report.
     1.4. . AF Form 813, Request for Environmental Impact Analysis.
     1.5. Statement of Commissary Store Fund/Non-Appropriated Fund investments, signed by
     the BCE or Deputy BCE. Statement should include an itemized listing of those facilities
     which had a Commissary Store Fund/Non-Appropriated Fund investment. Contact the
     facility management office of the local Services and/or Commissary organization and
     validate Non-Appropriated or Commissary Store Fund investments.
     1.6. If applicable, USAFE Form 100, Supplies or Services Order under US - UK
     Government Agreements and associated supporting documents describing US Dollar
     investments to United Kingdom Ministry of Defense family housing (United Kingdom only).
     1.7. If applicable, USAFE Form 11, UK Construction Fund Authorization and associated
     supporting documents describing US Dollar investments to United Kingdom Ministry of
     Defense family housing (United Kingdom only).
     1.8. If applicable, other documentation describing US Dollar investments to United
     Kingdom Ministry of Defense family housing (United Kingdom only).
     1.9. AE FORM 405-8A-R, Disposal of Real Estate (Germany only).
     1.10. AE FORM 405-8B-R, Receipt for U.S. (Dollar And Euro) Improvements In Real
     Estate Released To Germany (Public Property) (Germany only).
     1.11. Pictures of interior and exterior of facilities being returned.
     1.12. AF Form 1192, USAF Installations Characteristics Report (not required for partial
     returns).
2. USAFE Form 27. Use USAFE Form 27 to document the complete or partial release of an
Air Force installation to a host nation. It serves as the outgoing inventory and condition report of
the real property to be released. It becomes an integral part of the formal transfer document.
     2.1. Form Preparation. Prepare USAFE Forms 27 after the installation has been officially
     announced for closure or draw down. Multiple facilities may be listed on the form. The
     form is self-explanatory, except:
        2.1.1. In column (a), Facility Number, delete any zeros at the beginning of the five-digit
        facility number, e.g., enter 386 if the facility number is 00386.
USAFEI32-9002 25 APRIL 2013                                                                      3


     2.1.2. Place an “X” in the appropriate column under column (d), Capital Investments
     Funding Source, for each facility listed. Do not enter any monetary amounts on the form.
     2.1.3. Fill in column (e), Condition of Property, during the joint US-host nation
     inspection and inventory of facilities. Enter the appropriate numerical designation, e.g.,
     1, 2, or 3, to record the condition of the facility. Use the guidance at Attachment 2 to
     determine facility condition ratings. This guidance supersedes previously published
     criteria. If the host nation facility condition rating conflicts with the US rating, enter the
     US rating in column (e). Enter the host nation rating and explain the reasons for the
     discrepancy in column (f), Remarks.
     2.1.4. In column (f), Remarks, record only major facility damages, such as roof caved in,
     heating system inoperative, electrical panel missing, etc. Do not record damages caused
     by fair wear and tear, such as nail holes in walls, worn carpeting, burnt out lights, etc.
     2.1.5. In block 3, Real Property Manager, type or print name of the real property
     accountable officer authorized to release or transfer the real property to the host nation.
     2.1.6. Make entries on the form in both English and the host nation language, unless
     advised otherwise by Real Estate Management (HQ USAFE/A7AR).
  2.2. Unilateral Reports. If conducting a joint inventory and condition report of facilities is
  not feasible, the base civil engineer prepares the USAFE Form 27 unilaterally to document
  the scope and condition of the facilities at the time of release.
  2.3. Disagreement on Condition Ratings. Leave column (e) blank and note host nation
  condition rating and US condition rating in column (f).
  2.4. United Kingdom Installations. Royal Air Force Form 2, Proceedings of Board of
  Officers, Board of Inquiry etc., is completed and provided by the Royal Air Force thru the
  Office of the local RAF Commander to the local US Visiting Forces Base Real Estate office.
  The Royal Air Force Form 2 is used to document the release of property including family
  housing and must be kept in the file at the local US Visiting Forces Base Real Estate Office.
  In addition, to document the condition for future residual value negotiations, use USAFE
  Form 27 for releases of military family housing and related supporting facilities, such as
  pavements, utilities, and miscellaneous structures directly related to family housing.

GUIDANCE ON FACILITY CONDITION RATINGS, USAFE FORM 27, COLUMN (E)

A2.1. Rate the condition of each facility according to the following criteria:
   A2.1.1. Good: Facility is fully functional for the purpose it was designed. It requires no
   major repairs or maintenance to exterior or interior. All utility systems are operational.
   Requires only minor beautification work, such as painting, carpeting, etc.
   A2.1.2. Average: Facility is functional, but requires minor repairs or maintenance. One
   utility system requires minor repairs or replacement. Exterior or interior surfaces have only
   minor damages.
   A2.1.3. Poor: Facility is not functional. It requires major repairs and maintenance to the
   exterior, interior, or utility systems. Facility has extensive damage or is missing major
   components.
   A2.1.4. Consider at least 50 percent of the facility area in arriving at the condition rating.
   An isolated discrepancy, such as a single room in a multi-room building needing carpet
   replacement, will not by itself affect the overall rating.
   A2.1.5. Do not consider the planned reuse of the facility by the host nation to determine
   condition rating. Base the rating on the existing physical condition of the facility on the date
   of inspection.
