      17.8.1. Not authorized.

18. Application Process:
   18.1. Using the USAFE Form 79:
      18.1.1. Applications for a USAFE Form 77 may be made for the following reasons and
      will be made using the USAFE Form 79.
          18.1.1.1. Reason for Issue. An individual may apply for a USAFE Form 77 for one
          of the following reasons; initial issue, renewal, the original USAFE Form 77 was lost
          or stolen or to replace an unserviceable USAFE Form 77.
      18.1.2. Approving Official.
          18.1.2.1. The approving official is key to the integrity of the issuance of base entry
          credentials for USAF installations in the UK.
          18.1.2.2. Unit commanders will designate approving officials in writing. If the
          sponsoring organization does not have a military rank or civilian pay grade structure
          (for example, Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES), military banking
          facilities, government travel agency and activities), the local senior manager or
          deputy of the organization is authorized to sign the USAFE Form 79.
18                                                             3AFI 31-201 28 AUGUST 2009


            18.1.2.2.1. Approving  officials   must      have     a    DD   Form     577,
            Appointment/Termination Record--Authorized Signature, or an appropriately
            signed Memorandum for Record on file prior to signing the USAFE Form 79.
        18.1.2.3. NATO Sending States and the United States Mission, United Kingdom, will
        submit their approving official designation memorandum through 3 AF-UK/IR to the
        appropriate installation agency that will validate the document and provide it to the
        appropriate SF Pass and Registration office.
        18.1.2.4. Approving officials will ensure the requirements and intent of this
        instruction are followed.
     18.1.3. Person Category. An applicant’s person category governs the requirements and
     type of pass to be issued and the associated restrictions. Approving officials will state the
     person category on the USAFE Form 79. The SF Pass and Registration office issuing
     officials will verify its correctness. The registration requirements and restrictions vary
     among person categories based on risk.
     18.1.4. Sponsors will request the type of pass based on the applicant’s person category
     and the circumstances under which the applicant is applying. In order to receive a
     USAFE Form 77, the USAFE Form 79 must be accomplished with all requirements for
     that person category fulfilled.
     18.1.5. Background Checks. Background checks are conducted to determine if a USAFE
     Form 77 applicant is a security risk. Background-check requirements are based on an
     individual’s person category. Sponsoring organizations are responsible for completing
     required background checks. SF Pass and Registration issuing officials will require
     verification that a background check has been completed or, when applicable, that a
     background check has been initiated. Sponsoring organizations should reference the
     appropriate person category to determine the exact background-check requirements for
     each applicant.
     18.1.6. Number of Installations to Which Access is Required.
        18.1.6.1. One of the key objectives of base entry control procedures to USAF
        installations in the UK is to limit access to the minimum number of installations,
        based on individual requirements.
        18.1.6.2. If justification is required for an individual to enter USAF installations in
        the UK other than the one issuing the USAFE Form 77, the person category will
        determine what process is used. Refer to paragraph 1.4. for multiple base entry
        requirements and procedures. The SF Pass and Registration issuing official will:
            18.1.6.2.1. Ensure the level-of-access requested does not exceed the approving
            official’s authority. (e.g. unit commander granting 3AF-UK wide base access)
            18.1.6.2.2. Scrutinize all applications to ensure they are filled out correctly and
            the justification is adequate for the person category submitted.
            18.1.6.2.3. Clarify inadequate justifications by coordinating with the approving
            official.
            18.1.6.2.4. Properly route the application
3AFI 31-201 28 AUGUST 2009                                                                      19


       18.1.7. Days and Times Access is Required. Approving officials will ensure the USAFE
       Form 79 shows the minimum days and times access is required.
       18.1.8. Sign-in Privileges. Approving officials may request sign-in privileges for the
       applicant only if bona fide justification is available. Sign-in privileges are on a case-by-
       case basis and will be granted when a valid and continuing work-related requirement
       exists. The only exceptions are the “NATO Member” person categories, which receive
       automatic sign-in privileges and their USAFE Form 77 will be annotated “Escort
       Official”. In most cases, sign-in privileges will be limited to contractors and individuals
       on official business.
          18.1.8.1. Person categories with authorized sign-in privileges may sign-in no more
          than six individuals.
       18.1.9. FPCON Restrictions. Based on an individual’s person category. If approving
       officials wish to further restrict access at any FPCON level, the USAFE Form 79 must
       indicate the imposed restriction.
