1. Mission. The Secretary of the Air Force, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. §§ 8013-8016, may
establish offices and officials within the Secretariat to assist the Secretary in carrying out
his or her responsibilities. As documented by paragraph 4.2 of AFMD 1, Headquarters
Air Force, and this Headquarters Air Force (HAF) Mission Directive, the Auditor
General (SAF/AG) is established as part of the Secretariat. The SAF/AG has overall
responsibility for the internal audit mission for the Department of the Air Force. The
Secretary of the Air Force retains ultimate responsibility for all policies related to the
Department of the Air Force. Within his/her areas of responsibility, the SAF/AG
prepares policies for approval and issues official guidance/procedures via official Air
Force publications to ensure implementation of those policies.

2. Organizational Relationships. The Secretary of the Air Force is responsible for, and
has all legal authority necessary to conduct, the affairs of the Department of the Air
Force. The Secretariat, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, and Air Staff offices perform
their Department of the Air Force functions subject to the authority, direction, and control
of the Secretary of the Air Force.

   2.1. The SAF/AG reports to the Secretary of the Air Force, serves as an agent of the
   Secretary within assigned policy and program domains, and provides guidance,
   direction, and oversight for all matters pertaining to the formulation, review, and
   execution of plans, policies, programs, and budgets within his/her area of
   responsibility. The SAF/AG is accountable to the Secretary for results achieved
   within the policy and program domains assigned by this Directive.

    2.2. The SAF/AG is part of the Secretariat and as such works closely with other HAF
    offices to assist the Secretary of the Air Force in carrying out his or her
    responsibilities. The SAF/AG and the Office of the SAF/AG work in cooperation
    with other HAF organizations, which are responsible, pursuant to Chapters 803 and
    805 of Title 10 (10 U.S.C. §§ 8013-8023, 8031-8038), for assisting the Secretary of
    the Air Force in carrying out his or her responsibilities.

       2.2.1. Pursuant to Headquarters Operating Instruction (HOI) 90-1, Headquarters
       Air Force Mission Directive – Delegations of Authority and Assignment of
       Responsibilities, two or more HAF two-letter/digit organizations with
       responsibilities in the same functional area are encouraged to develop “standard
       operating procedures” (SoP) that set forth procedures enabling covered
       organizations to fulfill and carry out their respective missions, roles, and
       responsibilities. There are no SoPs between SAF/AG and any other organization.

    2.3. The Air Force Audit Agency (AFAA), a field operating agency whose mission is
    documented in AFMD 17, reports to the SAF/AG.

3. Responsibilities. The SAF/AG is specifically responsible for:

    3.1. Serving as head of the AFAA.

    3.2. Establishing the overall program for internal audits within the Air Force in
    accordance with existing statutes, Comptroller General government auditing
    standards, and Department of Defense (DoD) policies. The internal audit program
    provides independent, objective, and constructive reviews and appraisals of the
    economy, effectiveness, and efficiency with which managerial responsibilities are
    carried out at all levels of Air Force management.

    3.3. Advising the Secretary, Under Secretary, Assistant Secretaries, Chief of Staff
    and Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the United States Air Force, and other HAF offices
    about internal audit and related matters.

    3.4. Directing follow up on management actions taken in response to AFAA reports
    and recommendations.

4. Delegations of Authority. Attachment 1 lists delegated authorities and assigned
responsibilities to the SAF/AG. The authorities delegated/responsibilities assigned to the
SAF/AG by this HAF mission directive may generally be re-delegated unless re-
delegation is expressly prohibited by the attached delegation or superseding law,
regulation, or Department of Defense (DoD) issuance. While the SAF/AG may re-
delegate authorities to other Department of Air Force officials, he or she will ultimately
be responsible to the Secretary of the Air Force for all matters affecting the internal audit
mission. Any re-delegation of authority/assigned responsibility made shall not be
effective unless it is in writing. Any person re-delegating authority in accordance with
this HAF mission directive may further restrict or condition the responsibility being
assigned or authority being re-delegated.

5. Notifications to Congress. No re-delegation of authority/assigned responsibility
under this HAF mission directive below the level of a deputy assistant secretary or three-
letter/digit office shall include authority to provide notifications or reports to Congress.
