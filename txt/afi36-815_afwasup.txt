SUMMARY OF CHANGES
This supplement has had many changes and should be reviewed in its entirety.

AFI 36-815, 5 September 2002, is supplemented as follows:
Chapter 8 – Excused Absences
Section 8A – General Types of Absences

8.1.2. (Added) Air Force civilian employees are full and equal members of the AFWA team and
are encouraged to participate, on a voluntary basis, in activities supported by the Air Force
without charge to leave or loss of pay. However, events cannot be scheduled over an extended
period of time (see para 8.1. of AFI 36-815), and, mission permitting, all civilians should be free
to participate.

8.1.3. (Added) AFWA/CC is the approval authority for excused absence for the AFWA Offutt
civilian employees. GSU commanders exercise the approval authority for their respective
organizations.

8.1.4 (Added) When absences are deemed official duty time, commanders and supervisors
need to ensure there is a fair and equitable application to all civilians and that the policy is not
abused.

8.1.5. (Added) When employees are approved to attend organizational events during duty hours,
the civilians must be at the event, on an approved absence (which includes 2-day break for shift
workers), or at their duty section.

Section 8C – (Added) Excused Absences for Physical Activities

8.15. (Added) Participation in Physical Fitness Activities. Permanent and term civilian
employees are authorized to participate in frequent, regular, and/or routine physical activities
during duty hours without charge to leave or loss of pay. Temporary employees serving
appointments of 1 year or less, or employees on an intermittent work schedule, are ineligible to
participate.

8.15.1. (Added) Full-time permanent and term civilian employees may use up to 3 hours per
week for physical fitness activities. Time off granted for part-time employees will be
commensurate with the number of hours they are scheduled to work. This time will not be
accumulated and carried over and includes time spent for dressing, showering, cleaning up, and
travel.

8.15.2. (Added) Physical fitness activities must enhance the Air Force’s mission in some
appreciable manner.           Approved physical activities are those which address
cardiovascular/aerobic endurance, muscular strength and endurance, or flexibility and body
composition. Activities may include intramural sports, running, walking, swimming, and use of
the base fitness center(s) equipment and classes. See Atch 2 for Civilian Health Promotion
Criteria. Physical fitness activities are restricted to the use of facilities under the control of the
installation commander or a geographically separated unit (GSU) commander-approved facility.

8.15.3. (Added) Supervisor Responsibilities. A supervisor must:

8.15.3.1. (Added) Ensure the program is not compromised or abused.

8.15.3.2. (Added) Has the authority to revoke participation privileges if any abuse is identified
and is not promptly corrected, or if workload will not permit it.

8.15.3.3. (Added) Ensure employee participating in the program receives a fitness education
assessment from their primary care provider/physician prior to beginning the program.

8.15.3.4. (Added) Ensure employee provides a completed and signed Request for Approval of
Excused Absence and Memorandum of Understanding for Physical Fitness Activities (Atch 3).

8.15.3.5. (Added) Ensure participant maintains a log or record of his/her fitness activities
(example at Atch 4). Fitness log is not mandatory as long as hours used are properly annotated
on employee's timesheet.

8.15.3.6. (Added) Whether approved or disapproved, maintain the original request for physical
fitness time, as well as physician’s statement, in employee’s Supervisory Record (AF Form 971).
AFI36-815_AFWASUP           1 October 2008                                                    3

8.15.3.7. (Added) Ensure excused absence for physical fitness activities is properly annotated
on the employee timesheet. The appropriate code is “LN.” The remark “physical fitness” must
also be annotated.

8.15.4. (Added) Employee Responsibilities. An employee participating in the program must:

 8.15.4.1. (Added) Ensure supervisor is provided a completed and signed Request for Approval
of Excused Absence and Memorandum of Understanding for Physical Fitness Activities
(Atch 3).

8.15.4.2. (Added) Receive a written fitness education assessment from primary care
provider/physician prior to participation in the program. Physician statement should include
language such as, [Employee’s name] is physically able to participate in [type of exercise
activities] without limitation, or with the following limitations...”

8.15.4.3. (Added) Maintain a log or record of physical fitness activities (Atch 4) and ensure
annotation on timesheet.

8.15.4.4. (Added) If an individual is unable to participate in an approved physical fitness
activity because of a qualified handicap, as defined by Department of Defense Directive (DoDD)
1020.1, that individual’s second-level supervisor may approve an alternate physical fitness
program to accommodate that individual. Such alternative physical fitness programs may
include activities that do not ordinarily qualify as an approved physical fitness activity. Second-
level supervisors may also allow the individual to use off-base facilities as part of this alternate
physical fitness program, if on-base activities would not accommodate the individual’s need.
Second-level supervisors may not authorize any individual, including those with qualified
handicaps, to take more than 3 hours per week for physical fitness activities. Utilization of
off-base facilities will be considered only upon justification/documentation from the employee
why on-base facilities are inadequate or inaccessible.

Chapter 9 – Voluntary Leave Transfer Program

9.3.1.7.1. (Added) See atch 5 for specific medical documentation requirements.

9.4.2.1. (Added) Each pay period, the supervisor will initiate contact with the employee or
immediate family member(s) (if employee is incapacitated) and review the medical emergency
leave application and medical documentation (Atch 5) provided to verify the continuing nature
of the hardship.

9.4.3.1. (Added) Supervisors must review leave balance sheets of employees seeking support by
voluntary leave transfer as provided by the civilian payroll office (given to the timekeepers) to
ensure annual and sick leave balances do not exceed 40 hours (each). Leave in excess of 40
hours must be used and properly annotated on the time and attendance sheet prior to using
donated leave.

9.5. (Added) Approving official is designated as the director or designee.

9.5.2. (Added) For employees serviced by the Offutt Air Force Base civilian personnel office,
first-level supervisors will notify AFWA/DPC who will arrange appropriate publicity (leave
donation list) of the employee’s need for leave; geographically separated units (GSUs) will work
directly with their servicing civilian personnel office.

9.6.4. (Added) Employees may remain on the leave donation list to recoup leave without pay
(LWOP) hours they may have incurred while waiting for leave donations. Supervisors must
ensure employees are removed from the leave donation program once they have recouped all
their LWOP hours.

9.9.2. (Added) First-level supervisors must review the employee’s medical emergency by
contacting the employee or immediate family member (if employee is incapacitated) to ensure
the medical emergency still exists.

9.9.3.3. (Added) For HQ AFWA, 1 WXG, and 2 WXG, the supervisor will provide
AFWA/DPC written notification to terminate employee’s leave donation request. GSUs will
work directly with their servicing civilian personnel office for specific termination instructions.

                                     Attachment 2 (Added)

                      CIVILIAN HEALTH PROMOTION CRITERIA

A2.1. Fitness Education Assessment. Civilian employees wishing to participate in the AFWA
Civilian Fitness Program must get a fitness education assessment from their primary care
provider/physician. Participants will maintain a log or record of their fitness activities (an
example is provided at Atch 4) and/or correctly annotate their timesheet with the appropriate
codes for fitness activities.

A2.2. Fitness Fundamentals. A complete fitness program should address cardiovascular/aerobic
endurance, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, and body composition.

A2.2.1. For an activity to be considered aerobic, the heart rate should be elevated into the age
and physical condition-specific training zone for at least 20 minutes. Walking, jogging and
biking are examples of activities that give this result. Golf, bowling and softball are examples of
activities that do not.

A2.2.2. Muscular strength and endurance exercises increase lean body mass, protect joints, and
increase the body’s metabolism. Machines, free weights, and general calisthenics are activities
that provide these results.

A2.2.3. Flexibility exercises involve stretching all major muscles in the body and help reduce
injury risk, and promote flexibility and mobility at each joint. Stretching sequences at the
beginning and end of exercise sessions promote this result.

A2.2.4. Body composition relates to the amount of muscle tissue and fat tissue in the body.
High levels of body fat should be reduced through a combined program of aerobic activity and
strength training.

A2.3. Use of Duty Time and On-Base/Approved Facilities. Participation in a health promotion
program established under this authority may include up to 3 hours of duty time per week and is
restricted to the use of facilities under the direct control of the installation commander or those
approved through the GSU commander. The use of duty time for this program may be
considered similar to other Office of Personnel Management (OPM)-approved health promotion
activities, such as smoking cessation classes.

A2.3.1. Use of duty time (excused absence) is appropriate only if approved by 1st and 2nd level
supervisors. Mission impact is the key element in making this decision. Overtime and
compensatory time may not be approved nor earned on days when use of duty time is approved
under this program. Credit hours can be earned on the same day, but will require working
additional time (e.g., Employee must work 8 hours, in addition to the fitness excused absence,
plus at least ½ hour for lunch, before credit hours can be earned. Meaning in this example,
employee is unable to earn credit hours until 9 ½ hours have passed—8 work hours, 1 hour
physical fitness, ½ hour lunch).

A2.3.2. In order to maintain the integrity of this program, fitness activities may only be
performed in or on base facilities or approved GSU locations.
