   in-garrison is to train to provide a level of readiness sufficient to assure the mobile Prime
   Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) teams, including Explosive Ordnance Disposal
   (EOD), Fire Emergency Services (FES), Readiness and Emergency Management (R&EM),
   and Staff Augmentation Teams (S-Teams), can adequately meet the expeditionary
   commitments pursuant to the appropriate operations plan and designed operational
   capability.
   1.1.2. Contingency/Expeditionary. The mission of the CES or CE Flight in
   contingency/wartime is to provide, operate, and maintain installations, infrastructure, and
   facilities necessary to create and sustain responsive, persistent, and effective combat
   operations on a global basis. CE forces support contingency operations by providing
   engineer support capabilities to employ, protect, sustain, and recover forces to meet Air
   Force and Joint taskings.
1.2. Assigned Forces. Until mobilized, the CES or CE Flight is under the direct control and
supervision of the commander to which it is assigned. Appoint squadron section commanders
and detachment commanders on orders when they must perform command actions. Authority for
such actions is contained in AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization and AFI 51-604, Appointment
to and Assumption of Command. Under Presidential call-up, pursuant to Title 10 United States
Code (USC) Section 12304, administrative control remains unchanged. Operational control
transfers to the commander of the supported command. Under mobilization authority, command
jurisdiction transfers to the commander of the unit to which assigned.

guidance is applicable to all AFRC Prime BEEF UTCs.
   3.2.1. Requirements and guidelines for AFRC CE deployments are contained in AFRCI 10-
   204, Air Force Reserve Exercise and Deployment Program, AFI 10-210, AFI 32-3001,
   Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program, AFRCI 32-2001, Prime BEEF Fire
   Emergency Services Program, and AFI 36-2250, Civil-Military Innovative Readiness
   Training (IRT). Any AT or DFT that is not coordinated per these requirements and
   guidelines may not receive command support.
   3.2.2. ATs/DFTs are used to obtain maximum hands-on on the job and upgrade training.
      3.2.2.1. Units will integrate the deployment training objectives into the units’ annual
      training plan.

     requests must be coordinated with and endorsed by the MSG/CC or equivalent and
     Wing/CC.
     3.2.3.2. All DFTs will be obtained through the official AFRC DFT process as described
     in AFRCI 10-204. Units will not contact other MAJCOMs, units or HQs to seek DFT
     opportunities.
     3.2.3.3. HQ AFRC/A7XO will review all responses and ensure requests do not conflict
     with any known inspections or visits. Units will forward AT/DFT requests to HQ
     AFRC/A7XO by 15 May each year.
        3.2.3.3.1. Individual and unit training is the primary emphasis. To assist HQ
        AFRC/A7XO in matching suitable projects/deployments to units’ training needs,
        units will provide the type of training and/or project necessary to meet known unit
        training needs and/or deficiencies, in the AT/DFT request.
        3.2.3.3.2. Units will indicate the total number of personnel in each functional area
        available to deploy off station for AT/DFT (i.e., Ops, FES, EOD, EM), and the
        optimum deployment timeframe (FY Qtr).
        3.2.3.3.3. To maximize priority and military airlift opportunities, units will keep in
        mind Deployment Review Board guidelines for priority airlift are 25 Pax or more,
        deployments with pallets, or projected commercial costs of $20K or more.
        3.2.3.3.4. With unit CC acceptance of assigned DFT, unless military airlift support
        necessitates a deployment/redeployment date shift, unit personnel will be required to
        deploy as programmed.
        3.2.3.3.5. Weekly reports are required from all DFT teams. Copies of the reports
        will be sent to HQ AFRC/A7XO, the NAF/A7C, and Wing/CC or MSG/CC or
        equivalent.
        3.2.3.3.6. After action reports are required to be submitted to HQ AFRC/A7XO
        within 30 days of returning from deployed activity. Copies should be provided to the
        wing/group commander. Reports should include a listing of all personnel deployed,
        project scope of work, degree of project completion, assessment of training received,
        quality of host base support provided, and any safety or project limiting factors
        encountered.
     3.2.3.4. AFRC Prime BEEF squadrons are required to attend SF IAW AFI 10-210. Units
     that qualify for a SF waiver must submit that request as an attachment to their AT/DFT
     request letter.
  3.2.4. HQ AFRC/A7XO will assign DFT dates/locations and enter all deployments into
  SMS. UDMs and Prime BEEF managers are encouraged to establish a Single Mobility
  System (SMS) account to assist with managing the unit’s AT/DFT program.
     3.2.4.1. Deployments will be coded in SMS as either a pending deployment, coded “P”
     or an informational deployment (home station or drive-away), coded “I”. The
     Deployment Review Group meets quarterly to review and consider “P” and “I” coded
     deployments for approval. Approved deployments will be recoded from “P” to “A”
     (Approved) and informational deployments will change from “I” to “B” (Briefed).
