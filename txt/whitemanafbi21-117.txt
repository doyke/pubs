   2.3. Software Requirements. The specific classified data purge or software upload
   requirement for each unit will depend on the type of unit, position in which it is installed,
   mission load, and failure mode.
   2.4. Types of data purge. There are two types of classified data purge that can be preformed
   off-aircraft on avionics LRUs. The first is the purge of the Operational Flight Program (OFP)
   software and the second is purge of the classified data mission files that may remain in the
   unit as a result of a failure of the on-aircraft classified data erase function. Typically only the
   OFP will require classified data purge.
3. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING AND CLASSIFIED DATA PURGE OF LRUS. 3.1
SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL RESPONSIBILITIES
   3.1. 1 Custody and accountability responsibilities. Once maintenance personnel have
   determined that they must remove an avionics LRU, the classification must be determined for
   proper handling. If is that LRU is classified, he or she must;
 4                                                    WHITEMANAFBI21-117 9 APRIL 2013


       3.1.1. 1 Determine the classification level of the LRU. Using Technical Order 1B-2A-
       2-40GS-00-1, with applicable interim operational supplements, and the B-2 Security
       Classification Guide, technicians must evaluate the classification level of all LRUs that
       are to be transported to and from the aircraft and prior to asset turn in to the supply
       system. If unable to determine the specific software classification after an aircraft flight,
       the LRU is to be handled at the highest classification level. The maintenance technician
       will initiate DD Form 1907, Signature Tally Record or AFTO Form 310, Document
       Receipt and Destruction Certificate for the unit.
           3.1.1.1.1. Top Secret level asset handling. Two personnel of appropriate clearance
           will escort the LRU to the CDP and remain in place until the LRU’s custody is
           transferred to the CDP Engineer. Custody may be transferred to new escorts of the
           appropriate clearance level or a facility with equal security accreditation and
           annotated on an AFTO Form 310, Document Receipt and Destruction Certificate.
           Custody transfer must be documented and maintained until the part is sanitized by, or
           custody transferred to, the CDP Engineer.
           3.1.1.1.2. LRU’s requiring Classified Data Purge. The maintenance personnel
           removing the LRU from the aircraft will complete an AFTO Form 350, Repairable
           Asset Tag and two copies of the applicable equipment condition tags. IAW AFMAN
           23-110, and AFI 31-401 Information Security Management, the AFTO Form 350
           must include this statement as follows:
“This item is classified at (state specific classification level) and must be handled IAW AFI 31-
401 and the B-2 Program Security Guide”
                   3.1.1.1.2.1. Classified LRU temporary storage. Once the LRU has been
                   documented, the LRU must be controlled and escorted Building 43, Room
                   137. Access to this area is controlled by the 509th Aircraft Maintenance
                   Squadron Electronic Warfare Element. Once the area is accessed, the CDP
                   Engineer must be contacted immediately and the LRU to be purged must be
                   signed in to the classified parts binder located near the entrance to the CDP
                   room 137C. Classified parts requiring classified data purge will be stored in
                   room 137 until they have been purged. This area is only cleared for open
                   storage of up to Secret/SAR; all Top Secret level parts must be escorted by
                   two Top Secret cleared personnel until custody is transferred to the CDP
                   Engineer.
                   3.1.1.1.2.2. Documentation and disposition. After the LRU has been purged
                   of classified data, CDP Engineer will stamp the AF Form 350 with the
                   appropriate information stating the LRU has been sanitized and is ready to be
                   turned in to the repair cycle. It is the responsibility of the individual avionics
                   specialties to follow up and ensure their LRUs are turned in to supply in a
                   timely manner. LRU’s that cannot be purged or identified as having no CDP
                   purge capability will be transferred to the CDP Engineer by DD Form 1907,
                   Signature Tally Record or AFTO Form 310, Document Receipt and
                   Destruction Certificate. The CDP Engineer will process the unit “paperwork
                   only” out of Supply and ensure the unit is manifested by the Traffic
                   Management Office (TMO) to the CDP Engineer’s EY7040 SRAN account.
WHITEMANAFBI21-117 9 APRIL 2013                                                                  5


                  The CDP Engineer will coordinate the classified shipment to the appropriate
                  purge facility.
                  3.1.1.1.2.3. Failed LRU’s requiring PQDR. If the LRU is being turned in as a
                  Product Quality Deficiency Report (PQDR) exhibit, it will be held in room
                  137 as a classified item until disposition instructions are received from the B-2
                  Systems Program Office (SPO). Do not purge LRU unless instructed by the
                  SPO.
   3.1.2. Deployed Operations. Maintenance technicians removing classified LRU’s from
   aircraft at a deployed and/or TDY location should use the aircraft for return to home station.
   This method should be considered first and must be coordinated through deployed/or TDY
   maintenance supervision. If using the aircraft to return classified LRU’s to home station is
   not an option, maintenance technicians removing classified LRUs from aircraft at a deployed
   and/or TDY location will turn parts over to cleared AMXS supply or LRS personnel for
   storage and transportation to home station The maintenance technician will initiate DD
   Form 1907, Signature Tally Record or AFTO Form 310, Document Receipt and Destruction
   Certificate for the unit indicating the classification of the LRU and label with “Constance
   Surveillance Required” to accompany the LRU. WARNING: During exchange with supply
   or LRS personnel, the classification of the LRU will be discussed using the 1B-2A-40GS-00-
   1, Table 1-6 and B-2 Security Classification Guide to determine LRU classification and
   proper cleared storage facilities/approved transportation is available.
      3.1.2.1. Specialist technicians will be contacted upon the LRU’s arrival at home station
      and be processed into SAR storage. The LRU will be signed in and stored in the SAR
      storage area located in Building 43, Room 137, until the LRU is purged.
   3.2. CLASSIFIED DATA PURGE FACILITY
      3.2.1. The classified data purge facility (CDP) located in Bldg 43 within room 137C and
      is operated by a CDP Engineer during the hours of 0700 to 1600, Monday through
      Friday. The CDP Engineer will provide operation of the CDP outside of normal
      operating hours on an as required basis. The CDP Engineer will acknowledge receipt of
      the LRU and provide an estimated completion date. Appropriately cleared personnel
      must be in the CDP when a purge operation is preformed as directed by the CDP
      Operating Instruction. The two-person rule will be adhered to when an LRU requires
      purge of Top Secret/SAR data. If only one appropriately cleared CDP Engineer is
      available, an appropriately cleared Air Force technician will act as the second person and
      witness the purge. When the classified data purge is complete, the CDP Engineer will
      remove any classification stickers located on the front of the unit (or side of the unit if
      equipped with carrying handles) and annotate on the AFTO Form 350 with the
      unclassified part number and national stock number (NSN). The engineer will also
      change the part number label on the unit to reflect the correct part number/NSN for an
      unclassified / un-programmed unit.
      3.2.2. Procedures for software upload of LRU’s. The following LRUs require software
      upload prior to installation on the aircraft:
Table 3.2.2. Software Upload of LRUs
 6                                                      WHITEMANAFBI21-117 9 APRIL 2013

Flight Control Computers – Boot ROM and              Center Instrument Display Processor (CIDS)
OFP                                                  OFP



       3.2.3. Initial LRU Configuration tasks. When one of the LRUs listed above is returned
       to Whiteman AFB from a repair facility, it will be an un-programmed unit with no
       software loaded. The unit will be receipted by Supply and identified as a Functional
       Checklist item, requiring further action, prior to placement in stock as a “Serviceable”
       unit. Supply will generate a “C-deck” document number against the CDP’s (124CD)
       SPRAM account to facilitate the uploading of software.            When necessary, 509
       AMXS/MXA will provide the CDP Engineer with written direction to load a different
       block of software. This would occur when a new software configuration has been
       installed on the aircraft. When an LRU is issued to the CDP for software upload on a “C-
       deck” document number, the CDP Engineer will upload the correct software and install
       the appropriate part number label for that block of software on the unit. Appropriately
       cleared personnel must be in the CDP when an upload is preformed. The CDP Engineer
       will classify the LRU per TO 1B-2A-2-40GS-00-1, Table 1-6 and applicable interim
       operational supplements, and the B-2 Security Classification Guide. The CDP Engineer
       will update the new stock number and provide DD 1574, Serviceable Material Tag, as
       required.
       3.2.4. Firmware upload responsibilities. When an LRU requiring software upload is
       issued to maintenance for installation on an aircraft, maintenance technicians will
       transport the unit to the CDP facility for upload. The CDP engineer will perform the
       upload, install the appropriate part number and classification labels, and return the unit to
       maintenance technicians. Technicians are responsible for handling and controlling the
       unit as required by its current classification until it is installed on the aircraft. If a unit is
       uploaded on-aircraft, maintenance personnel performing the installation and upload are
       responsible for installing the proper classification and part number/NSN labels on the
       unit.
       3.2.5. The ACC has a UV Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM) that must be
       removed from the unit to upload the boot ROM. The FCC has UV PROM cards that
       must be removed from the unit to upload both the boot ROM and the OFP. These units
       will require functional checks after programming and reinstallation of the UV PROM
       cards. The CDP Engineer will perform the functional check on the ACC.
     3.3. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS FOR CLASSIFIED DATA PURGE
     OPERATION:
       3.3.1. The CDP Engineer is responsible, until transfer of software ownership to the
       government, for control and management of software programs required to load returned
       LRUs off-aircraft and the application/removal of any identification or classification
       markings.
