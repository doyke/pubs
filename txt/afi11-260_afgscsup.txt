1.1. Overview. The AFGSC Tactics Development Program is designed to meet AFGSC’s
responsibility to serve as the lead command in developing, documenting, and issuing Tactics,
Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) for UH-1, B-2, B-52 and ICBM weapons systems. The core
of the Tactics Development Program is the documentation of validated best practices in Air
Force TTP documents. The program purpose is to maximize the mission effectiveness of
AFGSC forces by supporting both the continuous improvement of the operation of conventional
and nuclear forces and the continuing evolution of the impact long range strike assets have on
military operations, across the spectrum of conflict.

1.2. Identify tactical employment opportunities in all areas of ICBM, UH-1 and B-2 and B-52
nuclear/conventional operations.
1.2.1. Tactics: “The employment and ordered arrangement of forces in relation to each other.”
Within the AFGSC Weapons & Tactics (W&T) Program the term refers to employment options
that are developed through the formal tactics development process and are documented in
AFTTP publications.
1.2.2. (Added) Techniques: “Non-prescriptive ways or methods used to perform missions,
functions, or tasks.” Within the AFGSC W&T Program the term refers to non-prescriptive ways
or methods that may or may not be associated with a formally developed tactic.
1.2.3. (Added) Procedures: “Standard, detailed steps that prescribe how to perform specific
tasks.” Within the AFGSC W&T Program the term refers to prescribed ways or methods that
may or may not be associated with a formally developed tactic.
1.3.1. ACC is tasked by Air Force Instruction (AFI) 11-415, Weapons and Tactics Program, to
serve as the lead command in developing, documenting and disseminating tactics for the Combat
Air Forces (CAF). CAF, as used in this AFI, refers to units within ACC, B-2 and B-52 assets
assigned to Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), United States Air Forces in Europe
(USAFE), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), Air Force Information Warfare Center (AFIWC),
AFSPC, AFRC, and ANG.
1.3.5. (Added) Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) serves as the lead command in
developing, documenting, and issuing tactics for the B-2, B-52, UH-1 and ICBM weapons
systems IAW AFMD XX, Air Force Global Strike Command.
1.3.5.1. (Added). W&T entities foster tactical expertise in the operation of given weapon
systems (including the expert employment of systems and tactics in anomalous and/or hostile
conditions) as well as an appreciation for the broader role those systems play in support of
operational and strategic level operations and objectives. They develop procedures and unit
tactics for planning and employing operational mission and wing assets and advise unit leaders
on operational capabilities, limitations, and status of unit assets. The pursuit of continuous
improvement through rigorous and ongoing critical analysis of all unit operational processes is a
cornerstone of the AFGSC W&T Program.

1.4.2. (Added) AFGSC has a parallel tactics development processes aligned to support an
integrated tactics development program. AFGSC will conduct a separate Tactics Review Board
(TRB) to review Tactics Improvement Proposals (TIP) from UH-1, ICBM, B-2 and B-52 units.
The AFGSC TRB will be conducted prior to the CAF TRB. Any CAF-related TIPs identified
during this board will be made available for the CAF TRB. AFGSC/A3TW will forward the
CAF-related TIPs to HQ ACC/A3TW by 30 November each year for the CAF TRB.
Appropriate AFGSC representatives will be present at the CAF TRB to ensure proper TIP
integration.
2.1.1. HQ AFGSC/A3 is HQ AFGSC’s focal point for UH-1, ICBM, B-2 and B-52 Tactics
Development Program. AFGSC/A3 serves as the office of primary responsibility (OPR) and
program manager.
2.2.1.3. AFGSC will review all TIPs for concurrence. AFGSC/A3TW will make a
recommendation on each CAF TIP before it is forwarded to ACC/A3TW.
2.2.1.4. Tactics Review Board (TRB). The TRB affords AFGSC senior leadership an
opportunity to decide how and if to dedicate resources toward the development, validation,
approval, and implementation of a TIP. Additionally, interaction among TRB participants
allows for an exchange of ideas across AFGSC mission areas yielding additional opportunities
to improve current and future operations through tactics development.
2.2.1.4.1. The AFGSC/A3 or their designated representative will host and chair an annual
AFGSC TRB.
2.2.1.4.2. (Added) The annual AFGSC TRB is normally held in October to allow AFGSC/A3TW
time to properly evaluate and introduce AFGSC TIPs to the Combat Air Force TRB usually held
January.
2.2.1.4.3. (Added) The AFGSC TRB is a multi-day meeting of tacticians and select subject matter
experts usually broken into working groups representing each AFGSC MDS and select
operational topics.
2.2.1.4.4. (Added) TRB attendance is unit funded.
2.2.1.4.5. (Added) The AFGSC TRB is by invitation only. AFGSC/A3T will send invitations on
behalf of the AFGSC/A3.

personnel to comprise each working group to ensure the group is properly resourced to evaluate
the TIPs for which they are responsible.
2.2.1.4.5.2.2. (Added) This should include an expert representative from each division within
HQ AFGSC/A3 and other directorates, as appropriate, to ensure proposals are evaluated from the
most complete perspective possible.
