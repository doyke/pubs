This instruction implements AFPD 36-31, Personal Affairs and AFI 36-3101, Fundraising within the Air Force. It
outlines which fundraising campaigns are supported by Headquarters Air Force (HAF) and designates the Human
Resources and Manpower (SAF/AAA) as office of primary responsibility (OPR) for planning, managing, and
conducting campaigns. It applies to organizational elements of the Secretariat and the Air Staff.

SUMMARY OF REVISIONS

The revision updates the office symbol of the OPR from SAF/AAOE to SAF/AAA and makes some minor
administrative changes. A star (*) indicates revisions from the previous edition.

*1. Support Authorized for Fund-Raising Drives: HAF supports fundraising campaigns. In the National Capital
Area (NCA) these campaigns are:

1.1. Air Force Assistance Fund (AFAF), including Air Force Aid Society, Inc., Air Force Village, Air Force
Enlisted Village and the General and Mrs. Curtis LeMay Foundation (LEMAY)—February/March solicitation.

1.2. Combined Federal Campaign (CFC), including Local, National and International Agencies approved by Office
of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Local Federal Coordinating Committee (LFCC)—fall solicitation.

1.3. Approved emergency and disaster appeals as approved and issued by the Secretary of the Air Force.

*2. Responsibility for Drive Leadership:

2.1. AFAF Campaign: SAF/AAA provides staff supervision for the annual AFAF fundraising campaign for Air
Force military personnel within the NCA and issues appropriate instructions each year before the campaign.

2.2. Combined Federal Campaign:

    2.2.1. The Secretary of the Air Force, as chairperson, designates a vice chairperson for the drive.
    2.2.2. The Campaign Manager is the permanent administrator and as such, is responsible for planning and
conducting the campaign for Air Force personnel in the NCA.

2.3. Emergency and Disaster Appeals: The Campaign Manager manages appeals for emergency and disaster funds.

3. Organizational Participants for Campaigns: The organizational structure for the campaigns differs according
to the campaign; but generally the Secretariat, Air Staff, Bolling and Andrews AFBs, and elements in the NCA make
up the organizational participants.

4. Project Officer (PO) and Alternate Project Officer (APO):

4.1. Upon the request of the Campaign Manager, each 2-letter organization designates a PO and APO and reports
their names, room numbers, and telephone extensions to SAF/AAA by appointment letter. NOTE: To provide
continuity, an organization may designate a permanent PO and an assistant APO. Changes in such designations must
be promptly reported to SAF/AAA.

4.2. Qualifications of the PO. Each PO must be carefully selected, since the way he or she plans and conducts the
campaign will determine its success. In particular, the PO must:

    4.2.1. Have a grade and temperament that allows them to work effectively with all campaign workers.

    4.2.2. Be able to plan and personally discuss campaign strategy and progress with the 2-letter organization.

4.3. Duties of the PO. Each PO, working with the APO and under the general guidance of the 2-letter organization,
plans and actively conducts the fundraising campaign in the organization. The PO is authorized a minimum of one
key worker per 15 employees.

4.4. Cooperation with SAF/AAA. POs and APOs are required to work directly with SAF/AAA regarding publicity
and procedures for the turn in of campaign funds.

5. Participation by 2-Letter Organization: To ensure the success of fundraising drives in the NCA, each 2-letter
organization is expected to actively support their PO, and promote the various campaigns within their organization.
