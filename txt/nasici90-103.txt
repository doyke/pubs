SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This instruction was significantly revised and must be reviewed in its entirety. The most
significant change is the incorporation of the Joint Operation Planning Process (JOPP), outlined
in Chapter IV of JP 5-0, Joint Operation Planning, as a framework for NASIC’s Corporate
Process. Updates also include the addition of an “Overview” section and revisions to the
“Organization and Operations”, “Member Responsibilities” and “Administration” sections.
Additionally, the title of this instruction changed from “NASIC Council” to “NASIC Corporate
Process.”
1. OVERVIEW.
     1.1. The NASIC Corporate Process is a three-tiered structured approach to manage Center
     operations and determine resource application decisions. The NASIC Corporate Process is
     organized to identify Courses of Action (COAs) and provide decision options for the
     Commander (CC). The process serves to ensure thorough discussion on topics deemed
     important to NASIC mission success.
2. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS.
     2.1. NASIC’s Corporate Process consists of three successive levels: Panel, Board, and
     Council (see attachment 2 for Corporate Process structure) for the purpose of developing
     alternatives, recommending choices, and making decisions. Variations in the NASIC
     Corporate Process may be adapted for specialized purposes, such as financial management
     and wartime support operations.
     2.2. All three levels of NASIC’s Corporate Process will use the JOPP as the deliberate
     method to develop COAs for the CC and may also use the Military Decision Making Process
     (MPMP) as outlined in FM 101-5, Staff Organization and Operations, to gather additional
     examples for outputs and/or deliverables. Attachment 4 outlines the minimum required
     outputs and deliverables for each of the NASIC Corporate Process levels.
     2.3. NASIC Panels are chaired as directed by CC, Council or appropriate Board with limited
     focus areas such as production or facilities management. Depending on the topic, Panels
     may have permanent members and meet on a scheduled recurring basis. Membership may
     include Technical Directors, Deputy Commanders/Directors and, as appropriate, Subject
     Matter Experts for the issues under discussion. Panels associated with Group resource-
     related issues (e.g. mission/resource prioritization, initiatives) will typically be comprised of
     Group Deputy Commanders/Directors with the support of Group Resource Advisors. When
     an issue requiring development of COAs and a decision by the CC arises, a panel chaired by
     the issue’s Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) starts the NASIC Corporate Process.
     NASIC Panels are responsible for Steps 1 through 3 of the JOPP and the outputs and
     deliverables described in Attachment 4.
     2.4. The NASIC Board is chaired by the Vice Commander (CV).
        2.4.1. The Board reviews Panel conclusions and makes the determination to
        approve/disapprove the conclusions and recommendations of the panel under CV
NASICI90-103 15 MAY 2014                                                                    3


     authority or, forward a final recommendation (including any dissenting opinions) for
     approval at the Council under CC authority. The NASIC Board membership includes the
     entire Council membership with the exception of the CC, and at discretion of CV may be
     expanded to include others, i.e., Deputy Directors. The NASIC Board is responsible for
     Steps 4 through 5 of the JOPP and the outputs and deliverables described in Attachment
     4.
  2.5. The NASIC Council is chaired by CC (or in the absence of CC, by CV).
     2.5.1. The Council provides final decisions by CC with advice of Council members. The
     Council members consist of NASIC senior military and civilian leadership, including the
     CC, CV, Chief Scientist, Command Chief, Group Commanders, 2-letter Directors,
     Technical Directors, the Director of Financial Management, the Director of Security, and
     the Staff Judge Advocate. The Inspector General is a participant at the Commander’s
     discretion. Council decisions are final and actionable unless changed by the Commander.
     Decisions will be distributed to the responsible parties and executed upon. The NASIC
     Council is responsible for Steps 6 through 7 of the JOPP and the outputs and deliverables
     described in Attachment 4.
  2.6. Other Boards/Councils.
     2.6.1. The Financial Management Board (FMB), as established by AFI 65-601 V1,
     Budget Guidance and Procedures, approves financial execution strategy within NASIC.
     For purposes of this Operating Instruction, the FMB, when chaired by the CC, will be
     considered a Council. The voting membership of the FMB is determined by NASIC’s
     financial resource structure and may differ from normal Council membership.
     Recommendations to the FMB are developed by the Financial Working Group, chaired
     by the NASIC Budget Officer.
     2.6.2. The Information Technologies Management Board (ITMB), as established by
     NASICI 33-108, NASIC Strategic IT Management, approves the execution and
     management strategy for IT throughout NASIC. In accordance with the delegated
     authorities granted by the CC and the NASIC Council, the Chief Information Officer
     (CIO) will serve as the execution arm and authority on all directives associated with
     strategic IT management, acquisition, and modernization initiatives. The ITMB will go to
     Council only for issues that cannot be resolved at Board. When chaired by the
     NASIC/CC, the ITMB will be considered a Council. The voting membership of the
     ITMB is determined by NASIC’s Strategic IT Management structure as denoted in
     NASICI 33-108, NASIC Strategic IT Management, the ITMB Charter, and may differ
     from normal Council membership. Recommendations to the ITMB are developed at the
     Architecture and Engineering Review Panel as chaired by the Chief of the Systems
     Integration Management Office and delegated by the office of the Chief Information
     Officer.
     2.6.3. The Manpower Management Board (MMB), as established by this instruction,
     approves the execution and management strategy for NASIC manpower resources. For
     purposes of this Operating Instruction, the MMB, when chaired by the CC, will be
     considered a Council. The MMB will maintain a prioritized list of Center unfunded
     manpower requirements and a prioritized list the bottom 5% of NASIC funded manpower
     requirements and will periodically convene to compare the lists and make periodic
4                                                               NASICI90-103 15 MAY 2014


       recommendations on resource adjustments for Council approval. The voting membership
       of the MMB is determined by NASIC’s financial resource and organization structures
       and may differ from normal Council membership. Recommendations to the MMB are
       developed by the Manpower Working Group, chaired by the NASIC Chief of Manpower.
       2.6.4. Other NASIC coordination groups not formally mandated and established under
       other AF instructions/regulations but often labeled as Boards and/or Councils (i.e.,
       Facility Board/Council) are also covered by this instruction. At the discretion of the
       convening authority, these other Boards/Councils may operate under the guidelines of
       this instruction.
3. PANEL, BOARD AND COUNCIL MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES.
    3.1. Preparation: The OPR sponsoring the Panel will ensure all the outputs and deliverables
    are executed in accordance with the JOPP and Attachment 4. The intent is for the OPR to
    guide all stakeholders through the JOPP to achieve the outputs and deliverables required at
    the end of each of the three levels of the Corporate Process.
    3.2. Meetings: At each level the OPR will schedule meetings as necessary for output and
    deliverable development and decision points to move to the next level of the Corporate
    Process.
    3.3. Attendance: When present for duty, Panel/Board/Council members will attend
    scheduled meetings unless excused by the meeting chair. When not present, the
    Board/Council member’s designated acting alternate representative will attend and be
    empowered to make decisions for their respective organization.
4. BOARD/COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION.
    4.1. The OPR requesting or sponsoring a Board/Council meeting will coordinate with the
    Command Section staff to schedule the time, duration and location of Board/Council
    meetings.
       4.1.1. Provide read-ahead reference materials and draft or proposed outputs and
       deliverables to Board/ Council members with lead-time in accordance with Command
       Section policy.
       4.1.2. Provide a note taker during the meeting to record minutes and forward copies to
       XP within two weeks of meeting. XP will archive and email the recorded minutes to all
       meeting attendees. Minutes must include, at a minimum, meeting attendees, action
       items/responsible parties and decisions made.
    4.2. XP will maintain historical records of Board and Council minutes.
