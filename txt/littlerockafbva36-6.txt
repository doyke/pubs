                                         Options for Reporting Sexual Assault
              1. Restricted Reporting does not reveal the identities of the people involved and does not
            start an investigation, but the victim is offered medical care, counseling and a victim advocate to
            assist them throughout the process. You must contact the SARC (Hotline 24/7 987-7272), Health
            Care Provider, or a Chaplain for Restricted Reporting.
              2. Unrestricted Reporting starts an investigation and gets Commanders involved as well as
            other appropriate agencies. Again, the victim receives medical care, counseling and a victim
            advocate to assist them. For Unrestricted Reporting, you may contact AF Office of Special
            Investigations, Security Forces, commander or first sergeant, staff judge advocateâ€™s office, the
            SARC or the Command Post at 987-1900 who will put you in touch with the proper authorities.
