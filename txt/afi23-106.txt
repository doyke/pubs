SUMMARY OF CHANGES

This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. Major changes
include (reference to the (REMIS), RDS, and addition of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected
(MRAP) Family of Vehicles (FOV)). SRDs are used to establish a program for assigning
standard three-character reporting designators to identify items of equipment for use in various
automated management information systems (MIS). SRDs facilitate the reporting, accounting,
and analytical processes of designated items of equipment by maintenance and supply and
facilitate data interchange from one MIS to another. In the supply system, SRD codes are the
elements used to collect materiel usage data on specific weapon systems or end-items of
equipment. Commanders, customers and logisticians use this data during mission change
processing; ini- tial spares support lists updates, and reporting to AF on how well the supply
chain is supporting various weapons systems (ref AFMAN 23-110).
1. Roles and Responsibilities:
2. Air Staff (AF/A4LM):
     2.1. AF/A4LM is the office of primary responsibility (OPR).
3. HQ Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC/A4U):
     3.1. Is the SRD management focal point.
     3.2. Determines and serves as the cognizant authority for message group addresses to be
     used by the AFMC Centers and focal point for non–AFMC Center-managed Commercial
     Off-The-Shelf (COTS) for notifications to SRD users.
     3.3. Develops or recommends additional SRD management procedures, and/or SRD data
     products, etc.
     3.4. Ensures SRD changes, additions, and deletions are electronically transmitted to
     applicable MIS [IMDS G081], [REMIS, G099], and Integrated Maintenance Data System
     [IMDS G105]).
4. AFMC Centers:
     4.1. Air Force Network Integration Center (AFNIC) is the central focal point for SRD
     assignment for non-AFMC Centered- managed Communications – Electronics (C-E)
     Commercial-Off -The Shelf (COTS) equipment.
     4.2. The SRD manager in conjunction with the Mission Capable/Maintenance Data
     Documentation (MICAP/MDD) monitor will:
        4.2.1. Maintain the currency of the SRD tables in REMIS by adding, changing, or
        deactivating SRDs.
        4.2.2. Review all SRD assignment, deletion, or change requests (AF Form 1230,
        Standard Reporting Designator (SRD) Candidate Information).
        4.2.3. Notify major commands (MAJCOMs), field operating agencies (FOAs), and
        Direct Reporting Units (DRUs) of proposed additions, changes, or deactivation of SRDs.
        Accomplish notification using an organizational email message (Attachment 3).
        MAJCOMs and FOAs will have 30 days from the date of the email message to respond to
AFI23-106 24 MAY 2012                                                                           3


      SRD deletions. No response constitutes agreement. If the response voices disagreement
      with SRD deletion, the AFMC Center SRD manager will remove recommended deletion
      from the approval process for additional coordination with the MAJCOM/FOA until
      agreement is reached on final action.
      4.2.4. Make appropriate inputs to add, deactivate, or change SRDs in REMIS.
      4.2.5. Maintain a history file for new, change, and deactivation SRD requests. At a
      minimum, the SRD file will contain the AF Form 1230. Requests for change to an SRD
      will be filed with the original request to establish the SRD. SRD records will be kept for
      at least one year after deactiva- tion.
      4.2.6. Conduct an annual SRD review. This review includes verifying reporting in the
      equipment status, maintenance, and MICAP data systems to identify inactive SRDs for
      possible deletion, retention, or modification. Proposed deletions and changes resulting
      from these reviews will be coordinated with MAJCOMs and FOAs.

AFI23-106 24 MAY 2012                                                                     5


9. Requirement for SRD Assignment:
   9.1. Assigning SRDs. SRDs are assigned to facilitate MICAP, Maintenance Data
   Documentation (MDD15, TCTO, and/or inventory tracking on end-items of equipment.
   SRDs are not normally assigned to items that are already work unit coded (WUC) under
   established SRDs. SRDs may be assigned for aircraft blocks or communications-electronics
   (C-E) versions as required by the program manager.
   9.2. Maintenance Data Documentation (MDD). With the exception of engines, assign
   SRDs for MDD only if the item meets the requirements and rules for on-equipment
   maintenance action docu- mentation in accordance with Technical Order (T.O.) 00-20-2,
   Maintenance Data Documentation. MDD reportable end items must have a reportable SRD
   as well as WUCs to document completed on-equipment maintenance actions. Do not assign
   individual SRDs for MDD to items that are defined for off-equipment maintenance
   documentation according to T.O. 00-20-2; instead, use the SRD for the end item they
   comprise.
   9.3. Mission Capability (MICAP). Failure of the system/equipment will prevent
   performance of the required mission. The types of equipment/system that fall in the
   categories or requirements for MICAP reporting are:
      9.3.1. Aerospace vehicles and ground launch missiles (SRDs A and M).
      9.3.2. Aerospace engines.
      9.3.3. Type I aircrew training devices and direct mission support trainers.   Include
      ground training aircraft assigned to technical training school units.
      9.3.4. C-E, cryptologic, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and
      photographic equipment when uninterrupted service is essential to combat mission,
      support mission, or task accomplishment.
      9.3.5. Vehicles classified as support equipment (SE) and mission essential registered
      vehicles (excluding administratively used, general-purpose vehicles).
      9.3.6. SE that is in direct support of aerospace vehicles or other MICAP reportable
      systems, when failure of the SE will directly cause MICAP in the other reportable
      systems.
   9.4. Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO). Used for tracking completion of
   system/equip- ment modifications.
   9.5. Inventory. AF visibility of system/equipment is required.
10. SRD Request Procedures:
   10.1. During the acquisition phase, the system program manager (SPM), product group
   manager (PGM)) requests an SRD assignment. The single manager forwards the requests
   (AF Forms 1230) to the AFMC Center SRD manager. (See REMIS web page for specific
   POC.) The AF Form 1230 must be filled in according to the instructions on the back of the
   form. Submission of AF Form 1230 also applies to significant equipment modifications or
   configuration changes that may warrant additional SRD assignments.
 6                                                                    AFI23-106 24 MAY 2012


        10.1.1. The Lead Command program office requests SRD assignment prior to fielding
        for systems under their purview. Forward the requests (AF Forms 1230) to the
        appropriate MAJ- COM/FOA SRD manager who forwards the form to the prime
        equipment SRD manager. (See REMIS web page for specific POC.) The AF Form 1230
        must be filled in according to the instructions on the back of the form. Submission of AF
        Form 1230 could also apply to significant equipment modifications or configuration
        changes, which may warrant additional SRD assignments.
     10.2. Field activities submit requests for SRD assignment on items not assigned during
     acquisition, or for changes to existing SRD data elements, to the owning MAJCOM/FOA
     SRD manager using data from the equipment data plate, i.e., nomenclature, manufacture,
     model number, and part number.
        10.2.1. Upon approval, the owning MAJCOM/FOA SRD manager forwards the request
        to the appropriate program office.
     10.3. Attachment 2 shows the SRD request process.           SRD requests not following the
     process will be returned to the requester without action.
11. Assignment and management of SRDs:
     11.1. All requests for new SRDs must meet the requirements cited in paragraph 8.
     11.2. Assign SRDs to selected equipment in the Air Force active inventory or new
     equipment under- going acquisition. The first character of the SRD (Attachment 4)
     identifies a general type of equip- ment such as "A" for aircraft, "M" for ground-launched
     missiles, "T" for training equipment, etc. The last two characters of the SRD code are used
     to identify specific equipment. They have no other spe- cific meaning but provide a quantity
     of codes to draw from when you initially assign the SRD (i.e., "ACH" for C-130E aircraft,
     "XGN" for T56-7 engines, and "BKP" for AN/GRR-23 radios).
     11.3. Multiple SRDs may be assigned for end-items having dual applications, such as a
     stand-alone configuration, as well as a component of another system requiring cost data
     tracking.    (e.g. aerospace vehicles with non-interchangeable engine or avionics
     configurations or engines installed to diverse aerospace vehicles).
     11.4. Location of SRD data. REMIS maintains the master table of valid unclassified AF
     SRDs, which is periodically transmitted to some MISs. Valid SRDs for classified equipment
     are found in other AF systems and publications. SRD codes for command mission equipment
     (CME) are in the REMIS SRD table.
     11.5. Use valid SRDs to administer data management in the following MIS or
     programs:
        11.5.1. High Priority Mission Support Kit (HPMSK).
        11.5.2. Mission Change Data (MCD).
        11.5.3. Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS/G099).
        11.5.4. Air Force Total Ownership Costs (AFTOC).
        11.5.5. Comprehensive Engine Management System (CEMS/D042).
        11.5.6. Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS/G105).
AFI23-106 24 MAY 2012                                                                      7


      11.5.7. CAMS for Mobility (G081).
      11.5.8. Special Studies.
      11.5.9. Deficiency Reports (DR) and Materiel Improvement Projects (MIP) as
      maintained in Information Central (INFOCEN/G021).
      11.5.10. Logistics Composite Model (LCOM).
      11.5.11. Readiness Spares Package (RSP).
      11.5.12. Weapon System Management Information System (WSMIS/D087).
      11.5.13. Mission Capability (MICAP) and Awaiting Parts (AWP) (LIMS-EV).
      11.5.14. Air Force Data Services (AFDS).
   11.6. Local levels assign "L" (IMDS) and ―Z‖ (Supply) prefixed SRDs. These are for local
   reporting purposes only.
   11.7. By accessing the SRD table directly through REMIS, you can also find the Defense
   Logistics Agency (DLA) Weapon System Designator Code (WSDC) as defined in AFMAN
   23-110V1, Part 1, Chapter 11, Sec 11 AK.
12. Deactivation of an SRD. When the equipment is no longer in the AF inventory or no
longer supported by AFMC, the lead Command is responsible for coordinating the removal of
the SRD from REMIS and sending a message to applicable field units stating disposition
instructions for the end item.
